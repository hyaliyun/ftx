It is classified as Major District / District Libraries under the system of Hong Kong Public Libraries. Before the library was established, Hong Kong Government provided the islanders with only mobile library service. History After the completion of phase IV of Cheung Hong Estate, Tsing Yi Public Library was established on the ground floor of Hong Shing House of the estate on 21 March 1986. Although the library was small, it had one children's library, one adult library and one reference library. The population of Tsing Yi Island continued to grow rapidly in 1980s and 1990s towards 200,000 as new housing projects were completed in the new town. The Regional Council decided to build a new library which was suggested in new town planning in 1980s. On 2000-01-31 the library moved to the current location, Tsing Yi Municipal Services Building. The library is on a single floor and is more spacious than the old library. Computing facilities and a newspaper reading room was introduced to the library. As the Council was disbanded, the library is then managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. Facilities * Adult Lending Library * Children's Library * Computer Information Centre * Extension Activities Room * Multimedia Library * Newspapers and Periodicals Section * Reference Section * Students' Study Room Mobile services Although the library in the central location of the new town of Tsing Yi Island, it is too far from the remote part of the new town. There are mobile services provided for Cheung Ching Estate in its south, Cheung Fat Estate in its north and Cheung Wang Estate in its east. It also lends some of her collections to other organisations on the island.

Early life Dorman's parents are Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Jack N. Dorman and Phyllis Dorman. Both parents are deceased. Dorman is married to award-winning TV/video producer, writer and publicist Denise (McDonald) Dorman of WriteBrain Media. He has a son, Jack, who was born in 2004. Dorman's father Jack Dorman was renowned for his work and awards in the field of radio-controlled airplanes. Jack Dorman created historically accurate interiors for the planes and was an expert at model building. Dorman attributes his attention to detail to his father and credits both parents with giving him emotional and financial support early in his career. Together, Dorman and his father won numerous awards for their model building projects. Dorman attended Saint Mary's Seminary and University in Maryland and The Kubert School in New Jersey. Dorman also taught a week-long seminar at the art department of Savannah College of Art and Design in the mid-1990s. The head of the art department at the time was Durwin Talon. Dorman has been asked to teach workshops at Flashpoint Academy and the American Academy of Art, both in Chicago, Illinois. He is also a co-founder of Comix Academy, along with Durwin Talon, Scott Hampton and Christopher Moeller and John van Fleet. This is a master class in comic book illustration. Career Dorman attended a graphic arts program at St. Mary's College in Maryland, but left after a year because it did not have an illustration component. Next, he attended The Kubert School in New Jersey, but left after one year because their curriculum only taught black and white illustration and Dorman wanted to be a cover artist. As an illustrator, he describes himself as self-taught.Logan, Casey (October 5, 1998). \\"Shalimar man voted best Star Wars artist\\", Northwest Florida Daily News, p. E6. Dorman began his professional career in 1979, and has done illustration for comic book companies Marvel, DC, and Dark Horse, but his break came in 1983, when his artwork first appeared on the cover of Heavy Metal magazine. Hasbro commissioned Dorman to paint over 100 pieces realistic artwork for its 3-inch series of G.I. Joe action figures in the mid-1980s. In 1994, Dorman was commissioned to do the artwork for a series of 90 trading cards for the Ultraverse comic book setting. In 1996, Hasbro asked Dorman to create more artwork for its 12-inch G.I. Joe collector series. Although he has produced art based on such characters as Indiana Jones, Batman, and Superman, he became most well known for his Star Wars artwork. The Star Wars Art of Dave Dorman was published in 1996 by Random House/FPG. Dorman won a poll of the readers of The Official Best of Star Wars Magazine in 1998, as \\"Best Star Wars Artist\\". Dorman won an Eisner Award in 1993 for his paintings in the book Aliens: Tribes. In 2010 he won the prestigious Inkpot Award at San Diego Comic-Con, where he was a featured guest that year.The Official Blog of Dave Dorman During that show, he also launched his new career retrospective book, ROLLING THUNDER: The Art of Dave Dorman, which is published by IDW Publishing and Desperado Publishing.http://www.davedorman.com Dorman began his roleplaying game (RPG) work beginning with Pacesetter Ltd in 1985, and began freelancing for TSR in 1987, producing cover art for Dungeons & Dragons books as Gargoyle and the original Draconomicon, among others. Dorman also did artwork for the games Shadowrun (FASA), Torg (West End Games, or WEG), Champions (Hero Games), Mayfair Games' \\"Role Aids\\", Rifts (Palladium Books), and Blood of Heroes. Dorman also produced all the art for some of West End Games' Star Wars role- playing game supplements in the 1990s. He did some illustrations for the Micronauts toy line in the early 2000s. Dorman has been known for more than 20 years because of his photo-realistic style of oil painting. Dorman's Star Wars: The Art of Dave Dorman cocktail table art book was the top-selling art book in 1996 for Ballantine Books and became the textbook of choice for illustration courses at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois. He was also voted \\"The #1 Star Wars Artist of All Time\\" by Star Wars Galaxy Magazine in 1996. Star Wars creator George Lucas is a fan of Dorman's work and has purchased dozens of Dorman's original oil paintings. Dorman held a license with Lucasfilm for many years to do limited edition prints. Dorman's own proprietary work, Wasted Lands, written by science fiction author Del Stone Jr., is currently making the rounds in Hollywood for a film adaptation. This action/adventure film is heavily influenced by Dorman's appreciation of directors like Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Whom he met on the Alien: Resurrection film set), Akira Kurosawa and Leone, as well as writers Joe Lansdale, Stephen King and F. Paul Wilson. Dorman is in development with Hollywood actor Dan Roebuck (River's Edge, Lost, Desperate Housewives) for a fictional children's book authored by Roebuck. Dorman is also in development with Dave Elliott's Atomeka Press for a Wasted Lands publishing project. Dorman has been featured in interviews for the Dennis Miller Radio Show, Mancow's Morning Madhouse, Sci Fi Channel, Turner Network Television's Southern Living Presents magazine program, and WEAR-TV in Pensacola, an ABC affiliate. Dorman is an avid supporter of Tom Roush's Pensacola Film Festival and the Baytowne Film Festival and he creates the artwork for their annual event posters. Dorman can be found annually at his Comic-Con booth in San Diego with his contemporaries, Scott Hampton, Christopher Moeller, and John Van Fleet. In 2010, Dorman was a \\"special guest\\" at San Diego Comic-Con International. Dorman exhibited for the very first C2E2 in Chicago in April 2010.

In the book, Dorman speaks candidly and personally for the very first time about his mid-life crisis and how he survived it. In 2009, Dorman was a judge for the SPECTRUM Annual, the fantasy world's bible for illustrators. In 2009, Dorman also made history by creating entirely digital art, for his very first time, during Reverie '09, sponsored by MassiveBlack.com and ConceptArt.org. Also in 2010, Dorman launched the podcast \\"Wednesday is Comic Book Day\\" with his wife, Denise Dorman ‚Äì a mash-up of comic book industry insider news, pop culture news and interviews. The podcast is a free download on iTunes and is available via Farpoint Media, the producers of the show.  Awards  Dorman has been the guest of honor at Comic-Con in San Diego three times.

Two of Thietmar's great-grandfathers, both referred to as Liuthar, were the Saxon nobles Lothar II, Count of Stade, and Lothar I, Count of Walbeck. They were both killed fighting the Slavs at the Battle of Lenzen. Life Merseburg Cathedral where Thietmar worked Thietmar was a son of the Saxon count Siegfried I the Older of Walbeck (d. 990) and his wife Kunigunde (d. 997), daughter of Henry I the Bald, Count of Stade (House of Udonids). His father fought with Margrave Odo against Duke Mieszko I of Poland at the 972 Battle of Cedynia. At the time of Thietmar's birth, his family sided with the Ottonian duke Henry II of Bavaria (\\"the Wrangler\\") in his uprising against his cousin Emperor Otto II. Later, a balance was achieved; Siegfried became burgrave at M√∂ckern and his brother Count Lothair of Walbeck served as margrave of the Northern March from 983 until his death in 1003. Baptized in Halberstadt, Thietmar prepared for an ecclesiastical career. He was educated at the St. Servatius chapter of Quedlinburg Abbey and from 987 onwards at the Benedictine abbey of Berge in Buckau near Magdeburg. From 1 November 990, he attended the Magedeburg cathedral school, together with his relative Bruno of Querfurt. He was familiar with the works of Augustine of Hippo, but even more with classical authors like Virgil, Horace, Lucan, and Macrobius. Thietmar witnessed the struggles of the young Ottonian king Otto III and his mother Theophanu to secure their reign. He took some part in some political events of the time; in 994 he was a hostage in the hands of the Norsemen, and he was not unfamiliar with the actualities of war. Upon the death of his parents, he inherited large parts of the Walbeck estates and in 1002 became provost of the family monastery, established by his grandfather Count Lothair II. On 21 December 1004, he was ordained as a priest by Archbishop Tagino of Magdeburg. In 1009, through the intercession of Archbishop Tagino, he became Bishop of the Merseburg diocese, which had been re-established by King Henry II in 1004. Thietmar was concerned with the full restitution of his bishopric. A loyal supporter of the German kingship, he rarely interfered in political affairs. He died on 1 December 1018 and was buried in Merseburg cathedral. Thietmar's Chronicle Page of Thietmar's Chronicle Between 1012 and 1018 Thietmar, while Bishop of Merseburg, composed his chronicle Chronicon Thietmari, which comprises eight books, that cover the period between 908 and 1018, the Saxon Emperors Henry the Fowler, the three Ottos, and Henry II the Saint. As counsellor of the Emperor and participant in many important political transactions he was well equipped for writing a history of his times. The first three books, covering the reigns of Henry I and the first two Ottos (Otto I and Otto II) are largely based on previous chronicles most of which are still extant (e.g. Widukind of Corvey's Res gestae Saxonicae, the Annales Quedlinburgenses and others); the fourth book, comprising the reign of Otto III contains much original matter; while the remaining four books, which describe the reign of Henry II to the year 1018, are the independent narrative of Thietmar and, besides being the principal source for Saxon history during the reign of Henry II, contain valuable information, not to be found elsewhere regarding the contemporary history and civilization of the Slavic tribes east of the river Elbe, as well as Poles, Hungarians and Bulgarians. The Latin style and the composition are not of a high standard, largely because, as the original manuscript reveals, Thietmar continued to make amendments and insertions to the text after it was completed. Nor does he always discriminate between important and unimportant events. The chronicle is nevertheless an excellent source for the history of Saxony during the reigns of the emperors Otto III and Henry II. No information is excluded by Thietmar, but the fullest details refer to the Bishopric of Merseburg, and to the wars against the Wends (Polabian Slavs) and the Poles. The original manuscript was moved in 1570 to Dresden. When the city was destroyed by bombing during World War II the manuscript was severely damaged, and only a few folios remain intact. Fortunately a complete facsimile edition had been published by L. Schmidt (Dresden, 1905). Thietmar's statement that the Gero Cross in Cologne cathedral was commissioned by Archbishop Gero, who died in 976, was dismissed by art historians, who thought he meant another cross, until the 1920s, and finally confirmed as correct in 1976 by dendrochronology.Lauer, Rolf.

This programme started in 1927 and is one of the oldest in India. In 2015, Railways decided to close down this examination after UPSC communicated that it was not inclined to continue conducting the examination.  Under Graduate Course  The Special Class Railway Apprentice (SCRA) program is one of the country's first engineering examination, and admissions have been hotly contested, with as many as 2,500,000 candidates taking the entrance examination, now conducted by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), for about 20 to 30 seats. The examination comprises written tests in mathematics, physics, chemistry, English language, general knowledge, and a psychological test (mental ability). The selected candidates are called for an interview, which is followed by a medical examination. The selected candidates undergo a four-year training programme in mechanical engineering, for which the Institute has a Memorandum of Understanding with Birla Institute of Technology (BIT), Mesra, Ranchi.

Apprentices would train at their railway's largest workshop (i.e. Jamalpur Locomotive Workshop) and for one year in United Kingdom. The selected candidates were required to appear in the mechanical engineering degree examination held by Engineering Council (London). After independence, the scheme continued and has provided Indian Railways with its top-ranking officers.  Academics  The SCRAs have distinguished themselves in academics, with 39 trainees obtaining honorable mentions from the A.M.I.Mech. E(London) from 1933‚Äì1939 and from 1954‚Äì1966 (records for the intervening period of World War II not being available). The BE (Mech.) degree is now provided in collaboration with Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. 56 SCRAs have also won gold medals in the examinations conducted by the Institution of Engineers (India) (IEI) and 3 have been awarded University Gold Medals at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra.  Alumni  The alumni of the Institute at Jamalpur have been an integral part of the Railways' evolution by providing high quality technical managers. Five SCRAs have risen to the ranks of Chairman, Railway Board while 16 have been Members of the Railway Board. A large number of SCRAs have been General Managers and Principal Heads of Departments in the Indian Railways and its sister organizations like RITES, COFMOW, CRIS etc. The SCRA-graduates have also been successful outside the railways, serving at the World Bank, universities, and as corporate executives. Over 60 alumni have been principal heads, chief executives or CMDs of renowned organizations in India. It is the most important course of Indian Railways. Rajendra K. Pachauri is an alumnus of SCRA.

The Loyalist Association of Workers (LAW) was a militant unionist organisation in Northern Ireland that sought to mobilise trade union members in support of the loyalist cause. It became notorious for a one-day strike in 1973 that ended in widespread violence. Development The LAW was formed in 1971 from an earlier, more minor group, the Workers' Committee for the Defence of the Constitution, and was initially led by Billy Hull, a heavyweight shop steward from Belfast.Abstracts on Organisations ‚Äì 'L' The LAW first came to prominence in 1972, with the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, when it became a leading force for the campaign against this move, ultimately coming to work closely with both the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party (for which Hull stood as a candidate after the Sunningdale Agreement) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). The group took part in a number of joint protests with the Vanguard.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 49‚Äì50 At its peak it claimed some 100,000 members.Kerr, p. 40 The LAW organised a \\"Day of Action\\" on 7 February 1973 when its members ensured that electricity supplies were halted in Belfast and other areas and forced the closure of many shops through intimidation. Protests were also organised outside Royal Ulster Constabulary stations, some of which turned violent, whilst a number of fires were lit, with a fire-fighter killed by a loyalist sniper in Sandy Row. A gun battle with the army ended with two loyalists killed, a Protestant and a Catholic were found murdered in separate attacks, whilst a Catholic church in Belfast's Newtownards Road and a Catholic children's home in Newtownabbey were attacked by loyalist mobs in what proved to be a night of violence. Hull nonetheless congratulated his members and declared the Day of Action a success despite five deaths.Bew & Gillespie, p. 59 The reaction of mainstream unionism was less congratulatory however as street violence and especially gun battles with the army an anathema to more respectable unionist leaders. Sensing the shift in opinion, the LAW issued a statement on 12 February condemning the \\"lawless hooliganism and vandalism\\" of that night. For William Whitelaw, at the time Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the actions of the LAW and in particular their control over the Northern Ireland power supply, confirmed his privately held belief that open conflict between the British Army and loyalist paramilitary groups was inevitable.Kerr, p. 53 Relationship with paramilitaries The group was represented on the umbrella loyalist Ulster Loyalist Central Co-ordinating Committee established in 1973.W.D. Flackes & Sydney Elliott, Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968‚Äì1993, Blackstaff Press, 1994, p. 334 Several members of the LAW, not least Hull, were also members of the UDA and one prominent figure in both groups was James Johnston, who worked for a haulage firm on the Grosvenor Road. On 22 August 1972 members of the Provisional IRA abducted him from his workplace and took him to the neighbouring Falls Road where he was shot and killed. Johnston's murder made him one of the first UDA members to be killed by republicans.McDonald & Cusack, p. 32 Decline Despite initially hailing it as a huge success the Day of Action saw the LAW go into decline. Mainstream unionism had baulked at the excesses of the night whilst some members were suspicious of Hull, feeling that his background in the Northern Ireland Labour Party brought his loyalism into question.Bew & Cillespie, p. 60 For his part Hull spoke of converting the LAW into a working-class loyalist party in the immediate aftermath of the strike, something that drove a wedge between him and his closest political ally Vanguard leader Bill Craig. Meanwhile, disagreements over how the LAW should become involved in anti-internment campaigns and whether or not rent and rates strikes, a favourite tactic of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in the late 1960s, saw the movement disintegrate.Wood, p. 33 The lack of a fully formalised structure meant that the LAW lost the vast majority of its membership following the formation of the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) and ceased to exist in the middle of 1974. According to Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack the UWC was established by Harry Murray because he wanted a loyalist workers group that was nonetheless independent of paramilitary control whilst the LAW was wholly run by the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, p. 74 Davy Fogel would also claim that the LAW was \\" a front organisation for us [the UDA]\\".Wood, p. 16 However, the LAW was notable because it pioneered the idea of using industrial action to advance the demands of unionism, which reached fruition with the Ulster Workers Council Strike. LAW became inactive, but Bob Pagles, who had led with Murray and had considered joining a cross-community peace movement, instead decided to restart it. Becoming its leader, he represented it on the United Unionist Action Council, which held an unsuccessful strike in 1977.\\"Glossary of the strike\\", The Irish Times, 2 May 1977, p.11 References Notes Bibliography *Bew, Paul & Gillespie, Gordon.

In 1917 Churchill drafted plans for the capture of the islands Borkum and Sylt, off the Dutch and Danish coasts. He planned to use sunken caissons filled with sand to form an artificial breakwater on the seabed. The proposal was shelved and forgotten. In 1940 the civil engineer Guy Maunsell wrote to the War Office with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not adopted.Engineering Timelines - Guy Maunsell: World War II Sea Forts and Harbours In 1942 Hughes came up with a similar idea for using caissons as part of a jetty while working as a civil engineer in London. He also submitted his plans to the War Office, and these were ignored until Hughes' brother, Alain Sior Hughes, who was a Commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, drew attention to the documents. Following Winston Churchill's famous memo 'Piers For Use On Beaches' dated 30 May 1942 the Mulberry project gained momentum under the direction of Major General D J McMullen and civil engineer Brigadier Bruce White. An early priority was the construction of trial installations in the Clyde estuary at Gare Loch. Hughes designed and supervised construction of a prototype jetty consisting of 'Hippo' concrete caissons sunk on the sea bed supporting 'Crocodile' steel roadway bridge units which spanned between the Hippos. The prototype was built at Conwy Morfa near Hughes' home town of Conwy and towed to Garlieston Wigtownshire in Scotland, where it was installed and tested against two other designs, both of which were floating roadways; the 'Swiss Roll' designed by R M Hamilton was made of canvas and steel cables, while the 'Whale' roadway designed by Allan Beckett consisted of flexible bridge spans mounted on pontoons.BBC - Coast Cardigan Bay to the Dee During the testing a storm washed away the Swiss Roll and created scour of the sea bed around the Hippo units, which in turn led to them tilting, resulting in the failure of the Crocodile spans. The Whale roadway design survived the tests undamaged and was consequently selected for use on the Mulberry harbours. One of Hughes' Hippo units did survive at Rigg Bay off Garlieston until it collapsed in a storm on 16 March 2006.Geograph photo of the Rigg Bay Hippo In June 1943 the War Office set up a committee of civil engineers to advise on the design of the artificial harbours and the equipment to be used in them. Despite their early submissions to the War Office, neither Maunsell nor Hughes were appointed to the committee.War Office, Artificial Harbours - from the papers of Sir Bruce WhiteRegister of Engineers and Transport Executives Available to Advise the War Dept - from the papers of Sir Bruce White Hughes' ashes were spread in the Menai Straits after his death in Colchester, Essex. His former family house in Bangor is now let to students of Bangor University, and has a Blue plaque outside of it in his honour. There is also a plaque to his memory in the museum at Arromanches.

Biography =Early life and education= Freking was born in Heron Lake, Minnesota, one of eighteen children of August and Rosa (n√©e Oberbroeckling) Freking. He received his early education at the parochial school of Sacred Heart Church, and then attended Heron Lake Public High School. In 1934, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Mary's College in Winona. He completed his studies in philosophy and theology in Rome, at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1937. =Priesthood and ministry= On July 31, 1938, Freking was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Luca Pasetto. Following his return to the Diocese of Winona, he served as a curate in Winona, Dakota, and La Moille, and as editor of the diocesan newspaper before continuing his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He there earned a Doctor of Canon Law degree in 1948. He became diocesan chancellor in 1952. From 1953 to 1957, he was spiritual director of the North American College in Rome. =Bishop of Salina, Kansas= On October 10, 1957, Freking was appointed the fifth Bishop of Salina, Kansas, by Pope Pius XII.

Part of an estate of , it is one of the seats of the Duke of Buccleuch, and famed for its beauty, its collections, and the fact it has survived virtually unchanged since the 17th century. While possessing a medieval core, its exterior evokes an opulent French chateau, causing it to be termed The English Versailles. The magnificence of the collections at Boughton is explained by the ducal family surname Montagu-Douglas-Scott, which reflects the union of three great families and their estates through marriage: Montagu, the Dukes of Montagu; Douglas, the Dukes of Queensberry; and Scott, the Dukes of Buccleuch. Boughton contains a comprehensive collection of furniture, tapestries, porcelain and carpets. The art collection includes many notable paintings such as The Adoration of the Shepherds by El Greco, Thomas Gainsborough‚Äôs portrait of Mary Montagu, and a celebrated series of grisailles by Van Dyck, and Breaking Cover by John Wootton. Once a servants' hall, located next to the kitchen, the armoury is now home to what many experts regard as one of the finest privately held armouries in the country. It is an historic collection that owes much to John, 2nd Duke of Montagu (1690‚Äì1749). Boughton House is a venue for events, weddings, corporate activities and organised groups. The House also opens on specific dates for guided tours. History The original house was a monastic building but Sir Edward Montagu, Lord Chief Justice to King Henry VIII, purchased it in 1528 just prior to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and began to convert it into a mansion. Most of the present building is the work of Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (d.1709) who inherited the house in 1683. Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu, was a patron of many Huguenot craftspeople. The Huguenot movement played an important role in his creation of The English Versailles. Montagu was an English ambassador to France, and Boughton House shows strong French architectural influences. His son, John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, made little alteration to the house, but made sweeping changes to the landscape and gardens after his return from campaign in Europe with his father-in-law, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.Boughton House Tour. Retrieved 18 August 2009 Following the death of George, 3rd Duke of Montagu, in 1790, the house passed, through the marriage of his daughter, Elizabeth, to Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, 5th Duke of Queensberry. From the mid-eighteenth century, Boughton House was little used or altered, but was well cared for. Because of this it has some of the best preserved baroque state rooms in the British Isles. According to Robert Edmonds, land steward at Boughton House in 1797, \\"In the year 1792 Boughton gardens were thrown open to the park and the deer and other stock were admitted. A considerable improvement has been made in them by means of the mud which was taken out of the ponds.\\" In the late twentieth century, Boughton became the dower house of Mary (\\"Mollie\\"), Duchess of Buccleuch, widow of the 8th Duke, who brought it back to life. The noted diarist Chips Channon, who was a guest in 1945 wrote: \\"It is a dream house with a strange, sleepy quality, but its richness, its beauty and possessions are stupefying. Everything belonged to Charles I, or Marie de Medici, or was given by Louis XIV to the Duke of Monmouth... There are 72 miles of drives in the park... The long view from the terrace here is like a Claude Lorrain... But it is the stillness, the curious quiet of Boughton that impresses the most.\\" Following the death of Dowager Duchess Mollie in 1993, the 9th Duke opened Boughton to small tours through arts organisations, and the house is now open to the general public for guided tours for a few weeks each year. Garden In keeping with the French style of its exterior, Boughton House is set amidst a highly impressive formal, yet arcadian garden of strict geometry, designed on the golden ratio. Vast swathes of turf, planes of reflecting water, strong lines of trees and linear earth forms create an intellectually meditative landscape indicative of the Age of Enlightenment and the idea that a garden could be a journey of the mind, yet acknowledge the natural world. The 2nd Duke, who had been nicknamed John The Planter, swept away the previous ornamental parterres, multiplied the avenues of elms and planes, and developed the role of water which structures the garden. Later, the landscaper of the garden at Stowe, Charles Bridgeman, who was under his employ, is believed to have created the sculptural earth forms.Orpheus and the Underworld, Mead, Andrew; Country Life, 22 July 2009 Restoration of the garden was begun by the 9th Duke, and has continued under the 10th Duke. It included returning the River Ise to its eighteenth-century width, which required two miles of green oak boarding, fixed by coach bolts. In 2009 landscape designer Kim Wilkie was commissioned to create a new work to complement an existing pyramidal grassed mount. The result, called Orpheus, is named after the famed musician of Greek mythology who, when his wife Eurydice died, went down into the underworld to try to reclaim her. His music was so beautiful that Hades relented and allowed Eurydice to return to the world of the living. This striking landform seamlessly continues the garden's intellectual dialogue via an immense inverted pyramid and spiral rill, both set within a golden ratio. In 2015 The Grand √âtang, or ‚Äòlarge lake‚Äô in French, a long-vanished lake of almost one- acre with a 75 ft tall water jet was recreated, to once again reflect the main frontage of Boughton. Located immediately to the north-west of the House, it is one of the earliest surviving features from the original gardens and designed landscape. It was created in the early 18th century as a reflecting pool for the house and was also used for ice-skating in the winter. Recent events In 2012 unknown scores of Italian baroque music, including by Vivaldi, were discovered in the Montagu Music Collection at Boughton.Marie Cornaz Unknown sources of Italian baroque music and new Vivaldi operatic discoveries in the Montagu Music Collection (Boughton House, UK), Revue belge de Musicologie, vol.LXVI (2012), https://kbr.academia.edu/MarieCornaz From 2014, Boughton has been the venue for the Greenbelt festival, a festival of arts, faith and justice held annually in England since 1974.Greenbelt Festival website Boughton has featured as a film location, including for the 2013 musical version of Les Mis√©rables.

The brand is named after Sir Gerald du Maurier, the noted British actor. The brand is also produced under license by the West Indian Tobacco Company in Trinidad and Tobago. History Pack of Du Maurier The brand was launched in the United Kingdom in 1930 after the actor Sir Gerald du Maurier had made requests for \\"a cigarette less irritating to his throat\\". He lent his name to the creation of a cigarette brand, the royalties for which he used to pay down his substantial tax liabilities. The tobacco company which launched the brand, Peter Jackson, was a subsidiary of International Tobacco, which was taken over by Gallaher in 1934. In 1979, the brand passed to British American Tobacco, which had owned the trade mark overseas since they acquired Peter Jackson (Overseas) Ltd. in 1955. The brand became the best-selling cigarette brand in Canada with a market share of 40%, and was also sold in various other countries. In 2005, Du Maurier changed the aesthetic of their packs and cigarette vending machines to compete with the introduction of new text and picture warnings, which covered 50% of the packs. It is presumed this was done to keep up with the rapidly changing cigarette market, which saw the introduction of new, cheaper brands as well as an increase in taxes and to give the brand a \\"new and fresh look\\". Various advertising posters were made for this brand, promoting the filter which would make for an \\"improved flavour and a cool and satisfying smoke... with no bits in the mouth\\". The brand is mainly sold in Canada, but also was or still is sold in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Malta, Libya, South Africa, United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Guyana, Brazil, South Vietnam, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

The cranes, which were named after the Biblical figures Samson and Goliath, dominate the Belfast skyline and are landmark structures of the city. Comparative newcomers to the city, the cranes rapidly came to symbolise Belfast in a way that no building or monument had hitherto done.http://www.denniskennedy.eu/belfast-giant-s History The cranes are situated in the shipyard of Harland & Wolff and were constructed by the German engineering firm Krupp, with Goliath being completed in 1969 and Samson, in 1974. Goliath stands tall, while Samson is taller at . Goliath, the smaller of the two sits slightly further inland closer to Belfast City. Construction Each crane has a span of and can lift loads of up to 840 tonnes to a height of , making a combined lifting capacity of over 1,600 tonnes, one of the largest in the world. Prior to commissioning, the cranes were tested up to 1,000 tonnes, which bent the gantry downwards by over . The dry dock at the base of the cranes is the 6th largest in the world https://www.trusteddocks.com/record/top-dry-dock-in-length measuring 556 m √ó 93 m. The H&W; logo was bolted onto the crane by Edward Salmon a shipyard worker who, before being apprenticed by H&W;, sold newspapers at the entrance. Decline of Harland & Wolff At its height Harland & Wolff boasted 35,000 employees and a healthy order book, but in the years following the cranes' construction the workforce and business declined. The last ship to be launched at the yard to date was a roll-on/roll-off ferry in March 2003. Since then the yard has restructured itself to focus less on shipbuilding and more on design and structural engineering, as well as ship repair, offshore construction projects and competing for other projects to do with metal engineering and construction. Initially there was concern that the now largely redundant cranes would be demolished. However, later in the year they were scheduled as historic monuments under Article 3 of the Historic Monuments and Archaeological Objects (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. Northern Ireland Office Minister of the time Angela Smith stated: \\"These cranes are an essential part of our city, our roots and our culture.\\" The cranes are not, technically, ‚Äòlisted buildings‚Äô, but are recognised by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency as buildings of ‚Äòarchitectural or historic interest‚Äô. Shipbuilding has ceased in Belfast, but the cranes are to be retained as part of the existing dry dock facility within the restructured shipyard, situated adjacent to the Titanic Quarter, a business, light industrial, leisure and residential development on land now surplus to the heavy industrial requirements of the shipyard on Queen's Island. They were still (2015) kept in working order and used for heavy lifting by Harland & Wolff in its other activities, however the company ceased trading in 2019. Recent history On 4 April 2007, Samson crashed into the long jib of smaller rail-mounted \\"Henson\\" tower crane, sending the smaller crane tumbling to the ground. The smaller crane weighed 95 tonnes and stood at a height of 25 m, compared to Samson's 106 m. Three industrial painters working on another rail-mounted crane were close to the jib as it fell, eventually crashing onto the ground. Information about the incident was not released until mobile-phone footage of the event was published on YouTube.Crane crash at H&W;, at YouTube. In October 2007, Goliath re-entered service after five years, an occurrence described by a company spokesman as underlining the yard's growing workload. In 2020, in the design of the new East Belfast GAA, the club crest has Samson and Goliath predominantly in the middle to reflect the notability of the cranes on the skyline of East Belfast.

These terms share almost identical licence criteria and development practices.  Terms  = Free software = In the 1950s to the 1990s software culture, the \\"free software\\" concept combined the nowadays differentiated software classes of public domain software, Freeware, Shareware and FOSS and was created in academia and by hobbyists and hackers. When the term \\"free software\\" was adopted by Richard Stallman in 1983, it was still ambiguously used to describe several kinds of software. In February 1986 Richard Stallman formally defined \\"free software\\" with the publication of The Free Software Definition in the FSF's now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin as software which can be used, modified, and redistributed with little or no restriction, his four essential software freedoms. Richard Stallman's Free Software Definition, adopted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as a matter of liberty, not price and is inspired by the previous public domain software ecosystem. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website, where it is published in many languages. = Open-source software = In 1998 the term \\"open-source software\\" (as abbreviation \\"OSS\\") was coined as alternative for \\"free software\\". There were several reasons for the proposal of a new term. On one hand a group from the free software ecosystem perceived the Free Software Foundation's attitude on propagandizing the \\"free software\\" concept as \\"moralising and confrontational\\", which was also associated with the term. In addition, the \\"available at no cost\\" ambiguity of the word \\"free\\" was seen as discouraging business adoption, as also the historical ambiguous usage of the term \\"free software\\". In a 1998 strategy session in California, \\"open-source software\\" was selected by Todd Anderson, Larry Augustin, Jon Hall, Sam Ockman, Christine Peterson, and Eric S. Raymond. Richard Stallman had not been invited. The session was arranged in reaction to Netscape's January 1998 announcement of a source code release for Navigator (as Mozilla). Those at the meeting described \\"open source\\" as a \\"replacement label\\" for free software, and the Open Source Initiative was soon-after founded by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens to promote the term as part of \\"a marketing program for free software\\". The Open Source Definition is used by the Open Source Initiative to determine whether a software license qualifies for the organization's insignia for open source software. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens., Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution, January 1999, , The Open Source Definition according to the Open Source Initiative Perens did not base his writing on the four freedoms of free software from the Free Software Foundation, which were only later available on the web. According to the OSI, Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term. On the end of 1990s the term \\"open source\\" gained much traction in public mediaThe Mysteries of Open Source Software: Black and White and Red All Over by Brian Fitzgerald, P√§r J. √Ögerfalk University of Limerick, Ireland \\"Open Source software (OSS) has attracted enormous media and research attention since the term was coined in February 1998.\\" (2005) and acceptance in software industry in context of the dotcom bubble and the open-source software driven Web 2.0. For instance, Duke University scholar Christopher M. Kelty described the Free Software movement prior to 1998 as fragmented and \\"the term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement\\". The term \\"open source\\" gained brought spread as open source movement which inspired many successor movements like the Open content, Open-source hardware, Open Knowledge movements. Under the impression of the success of \\"Open source\\" several journalists reported around 2000 the earlier \\"Free software\\" term and movement and its leader Stallman as being \\"forgotten\\". In response, Stallman and his FSF objected to the term \\"open source software\\" and fought since then for the term \\"free software\\".Why \\"Free Software\\" is better than \\"Open Source\\" on gnu.org by Richard Stallman (1999) Due to the rejection of the FSF and its leader Richard Stallman of the term open source software, the ecosystem is being divided in its terminology. For example, a 2002 European Union FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% of them associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and only 19.4% are undecided or in between.Free/Libre and Open Source Software: Survey and Study FLOSS Deliverable D18: FINAL REPORT ‚Äì Part IV: Survey of Developers by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh et al \\"According to this ongoing discussion, one would expect a sharp polarization of the whole community of developers of non-proprietary software into two very different parties, one of Open Source developers and one of Free Software developers. However, figure 39 shows that, although there is clear evidence of these parties, still a share of almost one fifth of the whole sample does not care anyway if they belong to the one or to the other party.\\" (2002) As both terms \\"free software\\" and \\"open-source software\\" have their fans and critics in the FOSS ecosystems, also unifying terms have been proposed; these include \\"software libre\\" (or libre software), \\"FLOSS\\" (free/libre and open-source software), and \\"FOSS\\" (or F/OSS, free and open-source software). = FOSS and F/OSS = The first known use of the phrase free open-source software (in short FOSS or seldom F/OSS) on Usenet was in a posting on March 18, 1998, just a month after the term open source itself was coined. In February 2002, F/OSS appeared on a Usenet newsgroup dedicated to Amiga computer games. In early 2002, MITRE used the term FOSS in what would later be their 2003 report Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense. The European Union's institutions later also used the FOSS term while before using FLOSS,European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2016 on Towards a Digital Single Market Act (2015/2147(INI)) on www.europarl.europa.eu as also scholar in publications.Free and Open-Source Software by ANDR√âS GUADAMUZ (2009) = Software libre = While probably used earlier (as early as the 1990sQuo vadis, libre software? by Jes√∫s M. Gonz√°lez-Barahona v0.8.1, work in progress, September 2004) \\"Software libre\\" got broader public reception when in 2000 the European Commission adopted it. The word \\"libre\\", borrowed from the Spanish and French languages, means having liberty. This avoids the freedom-cost ambiguity of the English word \\"free\\". = FLOSS = FLOSS was used in 2001 as a project acronym by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh for free/libre and open-source software. Later that year, the European Commission (EC) used the phrase when they funded a study on the topic. Unlike \\"libre software\\", which aimed to solve the ambiguity problem, \\"FLOSS\\" aimed to avoid taking sides in the debate over whether it was better to say \\"free software\\" or to say \\"open-source software\\". Proponents of the term point out that parts of the FLOSS acronym can be translated into other languages, for example the \\"F\\" representing free (English) or frei (German), and the \\"L\\" representing libre (Spanish or French), livre (Portuguese), or libero (Italian), and so on. However, this term is not often used in official, non-English, documents, since the words in these languages for \\"free as in freedom\\" do not have the ambiguity problem of English's \\"free\\". By the end of 2004, the FLOSS acronym had been used in official English documents issued by South Africa, Spain, and Brazil. Other scholars and institutions use it too. Richard Stallman endorses the term FLOSS to refer to \\"open-source\\" and \\"free software\\" without necessarily choosing between the two camps, however, he asks people to consider supporting the \\"free/libre software\\" camp.FOSS and FLOSS. Stallman has suggested that the term \\"unfettered software\\" would be an appropriate, non-ambiguous replacement, but that he would not push for it because there was too much momentum and too much effort behind the term \\"free software\\". The term \\"FLOSS\\" has come under some criticism for being counterproductive and sounding silly. For instance, Eric Raymond, co-founder of the Open Source Initiative, has stated in 2009: > \\"Near as I can figure ... people think they'd be making an ideological > commitment ... if they pick 'open source' or 'free software'. Well, speaking > as the guy who promulgated 'open source' to abolish the colossal marketing > blunders that were associated with the term 'free software', I think 'free > software' is less bad than 'FLOSS'. Somebody, please, shoot this pitiful > acronym through the head and put it out of our misery.\\"Please forget to > FLOSS Armed and Dangerous, Eric S. Raymond, 26 March 2009 Raymond quotes programmer Rick Moen as stating: > \\"I continue to find it difficult to take seriously anyone who adopts an > excruciatingly bad, haplessly obscure acronym associated with dental hygiene > aids\\" and \\"neither term can be understood without first understanding both > free software and open source, as prerequisite study.\\" Ownership and attachments None of these terms, or the term \\"free software\\" itself, have been trademarked. Bruce Perens of OSI attempted to register \\"open source\\" as a service mark for OSI in the United States of America, but that attempt failed to meet the relevant trademark standards of specificity. OSI claims a trademark on \\"OSI Certified\\", and applied for trademark registration, but did not complete the paperwork. The United States Patent and Trademark Office labels it as \\"abandoned\\". While the term \\"free software\\" is associated with FSF's definition, and the term \\"open-source software\\" is associated with OSI's definition, the other terms have not been claimed by any group in particular. While the FSF's and OSI's definitions are worded quite differently the set of software that they cover is almost identical. All of the terms are used interchangeably, the choice of which to use is mostly political (wanting to support a certain group) or practical (thinking that one term is the clearest). The primary difference between free software and open source is one of philosophy. According to the Free Software Foundation, \\"Nearly all open source software is free software. The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values.\\" Licences The choice of term has little or no impact on which licences are valid or used by the different camps, while recommendations might vary. At least until the release of the GPLv3, the usage of the GPLv2 united the Open source and free software camp. The vast majority of software referred to by all these terms is distributed under a small set of licences, all of which are unambiguously accepted by the various de facto and de jure guardians of each of these terms. The majority of the software is either one of few permissive software licenses (the BSD licenses, the MIT License, and the Apache License) or one of few copyleft licenses (the GNU General Public License v2, GPLv3, the GNU Lesser General Public License, or the Mozilla Public License). The Free Software Foundation (List of FSF approved software licences) and the Open Source Initiative (List of OSI approved software licences) each publish lists of licences that they accept as complying with their definitions of free software and open-source software respectively. The Open Source Initiative considers almost all free software licenses to also be open source and way around. These include the latest versions of the FSF's three main licenses, the GPLv3, the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). Apart from these two organisations, many more FOSS organizations publish recommendations and comments on licenses and licensing matters. The Debian project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licences comply with their Debian Free Software Guidelines. Debian does not publish a list of \\"approved\\" licences, but its judgments can be tracked by checking what licences are used by software they have allowed into their distribution. In addition, the Fedora Project does provide a list of approved licences (for Fedora) based on approval of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and consultation with Red Hat Legal. It exist also the copyfree movement, the BSDs as also the Apache and Mozilla Foundation with own points of views on licenses. =Public-domain software= There is also a class of software that is covered by the names discussed in this article, but which doesn't have a licence: software for which the source code is in the public domain. The use of such source code, and therefore the executable version, is not restricted by copyright and therefore does not need a free software licence to make it free software. However, not all countries have the same form of \\"public domain\\" regime and possibilities of dedicating works and the authors rights in the public domain. Further, for distributors to be sure that software is released into the public domain, the usually need to see something written to confirm this. Thus even without a licence, a written note about lack of copyright and other exclusive rights often still exists (a waiver or anti-copyright notice), which can be seen as license substitute. There are also mixed forms between waiver and license, for instance the public domain like licenses CC0Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in Berlin, Germany. and the Unlicense,The unlicense a license for no license on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)The Unlicense on unlicense.org. with an all permissive license as fallback in case of ineffectiveness of the waiver. Non-English terms in anglophone regions The free software community in some parts of India sometimes uses the term \\"Swatantra software\\" since the term \\"Swatantra\\" means free in Sanskrit, which is the ancestor of all Indo- European Languages of India, including Hindi, despite English being the lingua franca. Other terms such as \\"kattatra menporul (‡Æï‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±_‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øç)\\" for free software, where kattatra means free and menporul means software is also being used in Tamil Nadu and Tamils in other parts of the world. In The Philippines, \\"malayang software\\" is sometimes used. The word \\"libre\\" exists in the Filipino language, and it came from the Spanish language, but has acquired the same cost/freedom ambiguity of the English word \\"free\\". According to Meranau \\"Free\\" is KANDURI, Diccubayadan, Libre.

They occur in northern Mexico (Coahuila), the USA east of the Rocky Mountains, and southern Ontario, Canada. They are more aquatic than other members of the family, and are generally associated with permanent bodies of water with surface vegetation. This is a quite important aspect of their survival, as adult cricket frogs suffer high mortality rates when submerged in poorly oxygenated water (typically less than 24 hours on average in water that is ~1.2 mg/L). The common and scientific names refer to their call, which resembles that of a cricket. The two common species are A. crepitans and A. gryllus. A. crepitans are found in mesic woodlands as well as xeric grasslands, whereas A. gryllus are concentrated in mesic woodlands. Cricket frogs are able to communicate and attract each other using a specific frequency of their mating call, that sounds like a cricket. It can only be heard by members of the same population. Cricket frogs from other locales are unable to aurally process other calls, leading to mating isolation among the species.

It was founded by Owen Godwin on former cattle land in 1949, and is privately owned by his family. Billed as the \\"Alligator Capital of the World,\\" Gatorland features thousands of alligators (including rare leucistic alligators) and crocodiles, and many other animals. Attractions in the park include a breeding marsh with a boardwalk and observation tower, zip lines, an off-road swamp vehicle tour, a ridable miniature railroad, alligator feeding shows, alligator wrestling shows, an aviary, a petting zoo, and educational programs. The breeding marsh area of the park was used in the filming of the 1984 movie Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The park is known for buying and rescuing nuisance alligators from trappers that would otherwise be killed for their meat and skin. Gatorland also manages the live alligator display at the Gaylord Palms resort in Kissimmee.

The park claims that the Gatorland Express is the first amusement attraction in Central Florida. The original locomotive was retired in 2000 and put on static display, while a brand-new locomotive built by Custom Locomotive of Chicago was purchased and put into operation the following year. The new locomotive is the same model as the locomotive previously used at the nearby Green Meadows Petting Farm.Playground Magazine - All Aboard An additional fee is required to ride the railroad and prior to the 2011 opening of the zip line, it was the only non-animal-related attraction in Gatorland. 2006 fire Shortly before sunrise on Monday, November 6, 2006, a three-alarm fire broke out at Gatorland, apparently started when a heating pad in one of the displays in the gift shop shorted out; arson was not suspected. The fire was brought under control within several hours, but the gift shop was completely destroyed, and several walkways also burned. The fire killed a four-foot-long crocodile and two six-foot-long pythons, but spared the other animals. During the day, the birds that are displayed in and around the shop were moved to the aviary at the back of the park and were not injured. After inspectors confirmed that there was no structural damage to the various walkways and displays at the park, Gatorland reopened less than three weeks later, on the day after Thanksgiving. The gift shop and main offices were rebuilt as a two-story concrete block building, incorporating the repainted historic concrete alligator's mouth, and opened on May 22, 2008.

In contrast to the more familiar paraffin wax which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations. Microcrystalline waxes when produced by wax refiners are typically produced to meet a number of ASTM specifications. These include congeal point (ASTM D938), needle penetration (ASTM D1321), color (ASTM D6045), and viscosity (ASTM D445). Microcrystalline waxes can generally be put into two categories: \\"laminating\\" grades and \\"hardening\\" grades. The laminating grades typically have a melting point of 140‚Äì175 F (60 ‚Äì 80 ¬∞C) and needle penetration of 25 or above. The hardening grades will range from about 175‚Äì200 F (80 ‚Äì 93 ¬∞C), and have a needle penetration of 25 or below. Color in both grades can range from brown to white, depending on the degree of processing done at the refinery level. Microcrystalline waxes are derived from the refining of the heavy distillates from lubricant oil production. This by-product must then be de-oiled at a wax refinery. Depending on the end use and desired specification, the product may then have its odor removed and color removed (which typically starts as a brown or dark yellow). This is usually done by means of a filtration method or by hydro-treating the wax material. Industries and applications Microcrystalline wax is often used in industries such as tire and rubber, candles, adhesives, corrugated board, cosmetics, castings, and others. Refineries may use blending facilities to combine paraffin and microcrystalline waxes; this is prevalent in the tire and rubber industries. Microcrystalline waxes have considerable application in the custom making of jewelry and small sculptures. Different formulations produce waxes from those soft enough to be molded by hand to those hard enough to be carved with rotary tools. The melted wax can be cast to make multiple copies that are further carved with details. Jewelry suppliers sell wax molded into the basic forms of rings as well as details that can be heat welded together and tubes and sheets for cutting and building the wax models. Rings may be attached to a wax \\"tree\\" so that many can be cast in one pouring. A brand of microcrystalline wax, Renaissance Wax, is also used extensively in museum and conservation settings for protection and polishing of antique woods, ivory, gemstones, and metal objects. It was developed by The British Museum in the 1950s to replace the potentially unstable natural waxes that were previously used such as beeswax and carnauba. Microcrystalline waxes are excellent materials to use when modifying the crystalline properties of paraffin wax. The microcrystalline wax has significantly more branching of the carbon chains that are the backbone of paraffin wax. This is useful when some desired functional changes in the paraffin are needed, such as flexibility, higher melt point, and increased opacity. They are also used as slip agents in printing ink. Microcrystalline wax is used in such sports as ice hockey and snowboarding. It is applied to the friction tape of an ice hockey stick to prevent degradation of the tape due to water destroying the glue on the tape and also to increase control of the hockey puck due to the wax‚Äôs adhesive quality. It is also applied to the underside of snowboards to reduce friction and increase the gliding ability of the board, making it easier to control. Microcrystalline wax was used in the final phases of the restoration of the Cosmatesque pavement, Westminster Abbey, London. Use in petrolatum Microcrystalline wax is also a key component in the manufacture of petrolatum. The branched structure of the carbon chain backbone allows oil molecules to be incorporated into the crystal lattice structure. The desired properties of the petrolatum can be modified by using microcrystalline wax bases of different congeal points (ASTM D938) and needle penetration (ASTM D1321). However, key industries that utilize petrolatum, such as the personal care, cosmetic, and candle industries, have pushed for more materials that are considered \\"green\\" and based on renewable resources. As an alternative, hybrid petrolatum can be used. Hybrid petrolatum utilizes a complex mixture of vegetable oils and waxes and combines them with petroleum and micro wax-based technologies. This allows a formulator to incorporate higher percentages of renewable resources while maintaining the beneficial properties of the petrolatum.

The dates of his birth and death are unknown; but he was a disciple of Thomas Chippendale, and subsequently of the Adams, and was possibly in partnership with Henry Copeland. During the greater part of his life he belonged to that flamboyant school which derived its inspiration from Louis XV models; but when he fell under the influence of Robert Adam he absorbed his manner so completely that it is often difficult to distinguish between them, just as it is sometimes easy to confound Locks work with the weaker efforts of Chippendale. Thus from being extravagantly rococo he progressed to a simple ordered classicism. His published designs are not equal to his original drawings, many of which are preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington, while the pieces themselves are often bolder and more solid than is suggested by the authors representations of them. He was a clever craftsman and holds a distinct place among the minor furniture designers of the second half of the 18th century. Among his works, some of which were issued in conjunction with Copeland, are: A New Drawing Book of Ornaments; A New Book of Ornaments (1768); A New Book of Pier Frames, Ovals, Girandoles, Tables, etc. (1769); and A New Book of Foliage (1769). \\\\---- * English furniture designers 18th-century English people ","title":"Matthias Lock"},{"id":"2953928","text":"Fulk Basset (died 4 May 1271) was archbishop of Dublin.

He was brother of Fulk Basset, archbishop of Dublin, and hence nephew of Sir Philip Basset (d. 1271), the justiciar, and of Fulk Basset, Bishop of London from 1241 until his death in 1259, a prelate who was prominent during the troubles of Henry III's reign. He first appears as an official of Henry III in Ireland and of Edward I in both England and Ireland; he came to Ireland as his brother's vicar general and was made rector of Maynooth.

Due to differing release schedules, it was also released as the final episode of the first season in other countries. The episode originally aired August 28, 1995, on the UPN network. Directed by James L. Conway, it was written by producers Jeri Taylor and Brannon Braga. It was originally intended to be a two-part episode to bridge between the first and second seasons, and was subsequently re-written to be a single part. Due to late changes to the final act of the episode, special effects shots of the settlers' cities could not be completed, with which Braga and series creator Michael Piller were unhappy. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from the rest of the Federation. In this episode, Voyagers crew discovers a group of humans‚Äîincluding Amelia Earhart (Sharon Lawrence)‚Äîwho were abducted from Earth in 1937. Lawrence was cast as Amelia Earhart after she had previously worked with Voyager casting director on NYPD Blue. The episode shows the first time that a Federation starship lands on a planet's surface. CGI was used to show the landing struts unfold, and feet were added to the Voyager model for filming; however the production crew weren't pleased with these and obscured them during filming. The episode received Nielsen ratings of 7.5 percent, and was given a mixed response by critics. Among the criticisms were the density of the ideas in the episode and the gimmicky appearance of Earhart. It was also said to be redeemed by the vignettes showing the crew discussing whether to leave the ship, and that the episode contained a \\"powerful feminist narrative\\". Plot The crew of follows an ancient SOS to a Class L planet whose atmospheric interference requires landing the ship to investigate. On the surface, Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) leads an away team to discover the source of the transmission: a Lockheed Model 10 Electra with an alien generator added to sustain the SOS. Joining Commander Chakotay's (Robert Beltran) team, the crew finds a \\"cryostasis chamber\\" containing eight humans preserved since the 1930s, including Amelia Earhart (Sharon Lawrence) and her navigator, Fred Noonan (David Graf). After resuscitation, Noonan uses a handgun to hold the Voyager officers hostage, disbelieving their story and insisting on speaking to J. Edgar Hoover. Janeway speaks to Earhart and explains her significance to human history and to Janeway herself; Earhart, as Noonan's boss, tells him to cooperate, and some of them exit the caves. Outside, a firefight breaks out between the Voyager away team and three hooded figures. Janeway flanks the attackers and disarms them; they are human, and are surprised that Janeway is too. They had assumed the Voyager was a ship belonging to an alien species called the Briori. Janeway learns that the Briori visited Earth in 1937 and abducted some 300 humans, bringing them to the Delta Quadrant to use as slaves. The humans later successfully rebelled against the Briori, who fled and never returned. Fifteen generations later, there are more than 100,000 humans living in three cities on the planet. The last eight un-revived humans in cryostasis were believed dead by the others, who came to revere \\"the 37s\\" as \\"monuments to [their] ancestors\\". The settlers cannot offer the Briori technology that brought them there, as their ancestors dismantled the alien ship long ago, but they do offer to accept any of the Voyager crew into their society. Janeway thus faces a crisis of conscience over whether she can condemn all on Voyager to the 70-year journey home to Earth. Yet, if the choice is presented to the crew and only some decide to continue onward, the ship cannot be staffed by fewer than 100. Meanwhile, Earhart says that as much as she admires Voyager and yearns to learn more about it, she and the other 37s feel a stronger affinity to the people on the planet and they will all be staying. In the end, Janeway allows her crew to decide for themselves, and they all opt to stay aboard. Production =Writing= Brannon Braga in 2011 \\"The 37's\\" was written by Jeri Taylor and Brannon Braga. One of four season two episodes produced during season one (the others being \\"Projections\\", \\"Elogium\\", and \\"Twisted\\"), \\"The 37's\\" was originally intended to round out the first season of Voyager; UPN delayed these episodes to begin Voyagers second season before other networks' shows. This delay influenced a lot of decision-making about an episode that wound up pushed to the second season. Both writers wanted to end the first season by showing the Starfleet and Maquis factions aboard the ship banding together as a crew, accepting their long journey home, and \\"whining less about home.\\" The landing of Voyager was also intended to take advantage of the last episode of the season as an opportunity to really wow the audience. Braga wanted the episode to be broken into a two-part episode because of what he called \\"a wealth of material\\", what Kate Mulgrew would later describe as \\"every scene\\" containing a monologue. However, nobody else on the staff wanted to end the first season on a cliffhanger, as the first half would have been. Braga therefore condensed it into one episode, and admitted to struggling with the story, pointing out dramatically different tones in the first three acts as compared to the final two. Ultimately, though, he was satisfied with the end result and how the story came back around to focus on the Voyager crew in the end. The colonists' cities, which are described in the episode as \\"[something] to be proud of\\", \\"amazing\\", and impressive, were never actually seen. Jeri Taylor explained that the last act of the episode was developed late, and between budgetary considerations and time constraints, it was impossible to realize them. Unlike co-writer Brannon Braga and series creator Michael Piller, who felt not seeing the cities was detrimental to the overall episode, Taylor did not think the compromise was \\"a big deal.\\" =Sharon Lawrence= Sharon Lawrence in 2013 Casting for \\"The 37's\\" was done by Junie Lowry-Johnson, C.S.A., and Ron Surma. Lowry-Johnson was familiar with guest star Sharon Lawrence from their work together on NYPD Blue. Lawrence later expressed the belief that the qualities of her NYPD Blue character (\\"somebody who had ‚Ä¶ a professional strength about them\\") was what clinched her role as Amelia Earhart. The actress was excited to be portraying a version of Earhart, saying that she relishes the professional relationships roles like these have‚Äîas opposed to ones featuring \\"domestic or familial relationship[s].\\" In \\"The 37's\\", Lawrence was drawn to the relationship Earhart has with Janeway: two women, two professional pilots who have risen to great heights in their chosen fields. Not only did the historical character appeal to her, Lawrence also reveled in the \\"what-if\\" twist, the alternate historical story about what happened. Lawrence grew up watching Mulgrew as Mary Ryan on the soap opera Ryan's Hope. As Lawrence came from a family where women more often than not became homemakers, Mary Ryan was an \\"exotic\\" character‚Äîwith her career and life in New York City‚Äîwho served as inspiration. On the set of Star Trek: Voyager the two actresses spoke frequently about their careers, their backgrounds in theatre, and the struggles of balancing home and professional requirements. Lawrence felt that her relationship with Mulgrew influenced the relationship between their characters on screen. Mulgrew praised Lawrence's performance in \\"The 37's\\", saying that \\"[she] really played the hell out of that role\\". Although she specifically remarked on her pleasure at seeing Robert Beltran (Chakotay) again, Lawrence praised all the cast's professionalism and their ability to cope with the \\"vast amount of virtually unreferenced text that they have on Star Trek\\". =Landing the USS Voyager= A model of USS Voyager hung at Star Trek: The Experience (2007) Background For the original Star Trek, to avoid the tremendous costs of landing the every week, Gene Roddenberry invented the transporter to get the crew to and from planets cheaply and quickly. For Star Trek: Voyager however, the concept of landing the Voyager was considered from the beginning as a way to differentiate the new series from those that preceded it. Episode co-writer Brannon Braga explained that it was understood from the beginning that the ship could land. Effects \\"The 37's\\" is the first time in Star Trek canon that a starship is landed on a planet's surface. This was accomplished with a combination of computer- generated imagery (CGI) and physical modeling. Overhead views of the ship as it descended were CGI because it allowed the ship to descend \\"to a virtual pinpoint\\". Because the initial description of the ship described its landing capability, four small hatches on the ventral hull were included on both the ship miniature and model. However the legs that were to emerge from those hatches had not yet been designed by \\"The 37's\\". In the allowed by the design of the ship, Rick Sternbach had difficulty designing \\"an articulated set of legs and footpads\\" that would fold out and support some of the ship's . Shots of the unfolding \\"landing struts\\" were CGI because motorized versions were not installed in the physical model; visual effects producer Dan Curry later said that installing such motorized elements in the model was impossible due to the size. For filming the landed Voyager, miniature feet were made; however, because the producers felt the feet looked inappropriately sized for the rest of the ship, they were partially obscured by landscape in post-production. Scenes with the landed ship were shot in Bronson Canyon. Before filming, shots were plotted out with a styrofoam, \\"foam-core Voyager mockup for scale and perspective.\\" Since the canyon could not provide enough space to show the entire landed ship, the Voyager set down with the forepart of the ship visible outside the mouth of the canyon against a matte painting backdrop. Visual effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore later admitted that the composited Voyager in the canyon was far too small with respect to the shooting location, though without any visible references for the audience, and by keeping the cast between the ship and camera, it was not obvious to anyone except the visual effects crew. Reception \\"The 37's\\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on August 28, 1995. It received a Nielsen rating of 7.5 percent, meaning that it was watched by 7.5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was the most watched episode of the season, receiving the highest ratings since the first-season episode \\"Ex Post Facto\\". Kate Mulgrew later recalled that she \\"loved shooting every second of 'The 37's'\\"; she specifically praised the writing, Sharon Lawrence as Amelia Earhart, and director James L. Conway. Tim Russ (Tuvok) praised the episode as a fine example of science fiction and said he wished to see more of this type of episode. Braga felt \\"The 37's\\" had a lot of fun and cool elements such as meeting Earhart and landing the ship, but that the episode fell flat after meeting the colonists and never seeing their cities on the planet. Star Trek: Voyager co-creator Michael Piller described the premise of the episode as hokey, comparing it to \\"old Star Trek\\"; instead Piller praised the landing of the ship as \\"pretty amazing.\\" Series co-creator Rick Berman described \\"The 37's\\" as \\"a great episode.\\" Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera felt that \\"The 37's\\" had too many disparate ideas crammed into one episode. Specifically, in his view, Amelia Earhart served little purpose as the subject of Janeway's idolization (as compared to Captain Kirk and Abraham Lincoln in The Original Series episode \\"The Savage Curtain\\"), and he complained that she all but disappears from the second half of the episode. Kutzera also noted the lauded unseen cities. He awarded \\"The 37's\\" two out of four stars. In Frank Garcia and Mark Phillips' book Science Fiction Television Series, 1990‚Äì2004, \\"The 37's\\" was specifically called out for being gimmicky, noting the appearance of not only \\"a phony-looking, 1936 Ford truck ‚Ä¶ but long-lost aviatrix Amelia Earhart.\\" In his book Delta Quadrant: The unofficial guide to Voyager, David McIntee described the acting in \\"The 37's\\" as watchable, and felt the episode was redeemed by the little vignettes such as Earhart and Janeway's discussion, or Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) debating whether to leave the ship. He gave the episode a 6/10 rating. Though David Greven, in his book Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek, also described the plot as hokey, he felt the episode contained \\"a powerful feminist narrative of shared female aspiration and daring.\\" See also * \\"North Star\\" - a third season episode of Star Trek: Enterprise based on the same premise of humans abducted from Earth by aliens for slave labor and then revolting in a take- over.

Civic and military leader In 1775, Campbell was one of the thirteen signers of the Fincastle Resolutions, the earliest statement of armed resistance to the British Crown in the Thirteen Colonies. Campbell represented Hanover County, Virginia in the Virginia House of Delegates twice: in 1780, and again in 1781 (the year that he died). He was a militia leader of the American Revolutionary War, known for harsh treatment of Loyalists. It was alleged he had executed at least one loyalist, thus leading to their label of him as the \\"bloody tyrant of Washington County\\". He became a colonel in 1780, and was noted for leading his militia to victory at the Battle of Kings Mountain, where he charged the enemy while telling his men to \\"shout like hell and fight like devils!\\" Afterward, he worked in conjunction with Continental Army troops to oppose the British invasion of Virginia, providing support at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. The Virginia Assembly commissioned him a brigadier general in 1781, however, he died soon after.  Personal life  Campbell was married to Elizabeth Henry, sister of Virginia Governor, Patrick Henry. They had two children: Sarah Buchanan Campbell, and Charles Henry Campbell.History of Southwestern Virginia, page 584 Following Campbell's 1781 death of an apparent heart attack, his widow subsequently married General William Russell. = Salt Lick = The tract of land where the Campbells settled was called \\"Salt Lick\\" for the area's numerous salt deposits. The salt works that were eventually established there became an important source of revenue for the family, also playing an important role in supplying salt for the Confederacy during the Civil War. It had been surveyed in 1748, when James Patton entered the area with an expedition of several men, including one Charles Campbell.That survey identified the area as \\"Buffalo Lick\\" and Charles Campbell claimed the large area of land and made his home there. William Campbell's father was probably this same Charles Campbell. For his services, the \\"Buffalo Lick\\" was granted to Charles Campbell, Sr. by the king of England. William Campbell probably inherited the land from his father. After William Campbell's death, the General Assembly of Virginia granted 5,000 acres to his young son, Charles Henry Campbell, in consideration of the distinguished services of his father.His guardian recorded land adjacent to the Salt Lick tract in his name.  Burial and legacy William Campbell is buried in the Aspenvale Cemetery (near present-day Marion, Smyth County, Virginia), alongside Elizabeth Campbell \\"Madam\\" Russell. The cemetery is a Virginia historical landmark, with soldiers from six different wars interred there.

Thomas Munro's Statue, Madras (MacLeod, p.124, 1871) Equestrian statue of Thomas Munro in The Island, Chennai Major-General Sir Thomas Munro KCB (27 May 1761 ‚Äì 6 July 1827) was a Scottish soldier and colonial administrator. He served as an East India Company Army officer and statesman, in addition to also being the governor of Madras Presidency. Background Munro was born in Glasgow on 27 May 1761 to the Glaswegian merchant Alexander Munro. Thomas' grandfather was a tailor, who prospered by successful investments in American tobacco. After working as a bank clerk, Alexander Munro joined the family's prosperous tobacco business, but was ruined by the collapse of the tobacco trade during the American Revolutionary War. Thomas was also claimed to be a direct descendant of George Munro, 10th Baron of Foulis (d.1452), chief of the Highland Clan Munro, but clan historian R.W. Munro has contested this claim. Thomas was educated at the University of Glasgow. While at school, Thomas was distinguished for a singular openness of temper, a mild and generous disposition, with great personal courage and presence of mind. Being naturally of a robust frame of body, he surpassed all his school-fellows in athletic exercises, and was particularly eminent as a boxer. He was at first intended to enter his father's business, but in 1779 was appointed to an infantry cadet ship in Madras. Military career He served with his regiment during the hard-fought war against Hyder Ali (1780‚Äì1783), under his namesake Major Sir Hector Munro, 8th of Novar. Thomas also later served alongside another namesake John Munro, 9th of Teaninich. Thomas served again with his regiment in the first campaign against Tipu Sultan (1790‚Äì1792). He was then chosen as one of four military officers to administer part of the territory captured from Tipu, where he remained for seven years learning the principles of revenue survey and assessment which he afterwards applied throughout the presidency of Madras. After the final downfall of Tipu in 1799, he spent a short time restoring order in Kanara; and then for another seven years (1800‚Äì1807) he was placed in charge of the northern districts ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad, where he introduced the ryotwari system of land revenue. After a long furlough in Britain, during which he gave valuable evidence upon matters connected with the renewal of the East India Company's charter, he returned to Madras in 1814 with special instructions to reform the judicial and police systems. On the outbreak of the Pindari War in 1817, he was appointed as brigadier-general to command the reserve division formed to reduce the southern territories of the Peshwa. Of his services on this occasion Lord Canning said in the House of Commons: In 1819 Munro was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Governor of Madras In 1819, he was appointed governor of Madras, where he founded systems of revenue assessment and general administration which substantially persisted into the twentieth century. He is regarded as the father of the 'Ryotwari system'. His official minutes, published by Sir A. Arbuthnot, form a manual of experience and advice for the modern civilian. Munro was created a Baronet in 1825. He died of cholera on 6 July 1827 while on tour in the ceded districts, where his name is preserved by more than one memorial. An equestrian statue of him, by Francis Legatt Chantrey, stands in Madras city.At his behest a Committee of public instruction was formed in 1826, which eventually led to the formation of Presidency College. Incidents at Mantralayam and Gandi (Andhra Pradesh) St. Mary's Church, Madras The village of Mantralayam in Andhra Pradesh is where the famous Dvaita saint Raghavendra Swami is located. An anecdote of Sir Thomas Munro is told about this place. When Sir Thomas Munro was the Collector of Bellary in 1800, the Madras Government ordered him to procure the annual tax from the Math and Manthralaya village. When the Revenue officials were unable to comply with this order, Sir Thomas Munro visited the Math for investigation. He removed his hat and shoes and entered the sacred precincts. Sri Raghavendraswamy emerged from the Vrindavan and conversed with him for some time, about the resumption of endowment. The Saint was visible and audible only to Munro, who received Mantraskata (God's blessing). The Collector went back and wrote an order in favour of the Math and the village. This notification was published in the Madras Government Gazette in Chapter XI, page 213, with the caption \\"Manchali Adoni Taluka\\". This order is still preserved in Fort St. George and Mantralayam. Gandi Kshetram is located in Kadapa district of today's state of Andhra Pradesh in India. It is known for its Veeraanjaneya temple, dedicated to Lord Hanuman. It is believed that the main deity in the temple is a picture that was drawn by none other than Lord Rama, the protagonist of the great Indian epic, Ramayana, with the tip of his arrow. As the auspicious minutes to return to Ayodhya were closing, he left in a hurry in the Pushpaka Vimana, leaving the portrait unfinished. The non-existent little toe on the main deity's left leg corroborates this fact. The River Papaghni flows through the gap between the two hills where this temple is located. It is believed that Vayu Deva, the Wind God built an arch of mango leaves in gold from one hill to the other to welcome Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana, when they were returning to Ayodhya after killing the demon King Ravana in Lanka. It is said that this arch exists to this day and can be seen only by great and the most virtuous human beings. When Sir Munro was the Collector of Dattamandalam in the Madras Presidency, he was able to notice this golden arch with his eyes. This rarest occurrence was recorded in the Kadapa Gazette and was noted in Sir Munro's diary as well, by himself. Statue Sculpted by Francis Chantrey, and sitting proud and straight on his horse, in the middle of Chennai's famed Island, is The Stirrupless Majesty. Either due to an oversight, or depicting his affinity for bareback riding, Sir Thomas Munro's statue shows him without saddle and stirrup. It has been recently reported that this statue will be removed.

However, on 11 March 1708, Queen Anne withheld royal assent on the advice of her ministers for fear that the proposed militia would be disloyal.Queen Anne's veto is recorded as \\"La Reine se avisera\\" (\\"The Queen will consider it\\") in 18 H.L. Jour. 506 (1707). Content The bill's long title was \\"An Act for settling the Militia of that Part of Great Britain called Scotland\\". Its object was to arm the Scottish militia, which had not been recreated at the Restoration. This happened as the unification between Scotland and England under the Acts of Union 1707 had been passed. On the day the bill was meant to be signed, news came that the French were sailing toward Scotland for the planned invasion of 1708 and there was suspicion that the Scots might be disloyal. Therefore, support for a veto was strong. Significance The Scottish Militia Bill 1708 is the last bill to have been refused royal assent. Before this, King William III had vetoed bills passed by Parliament six times. Royal assent to bills generally came to be viewed as a mere formality once both Houses of Parliament had successfully read a bill three times, or a general election had taken place. In the British colonies, the denial of royal assent (exercised on the advice of ministers) had continued past 1708, and was one of the primary complaints of the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776: that the King \\"has refused his Assent to Laws, most wholesome and necessary for the public Good\\" and \\"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance\\".

Early years McMichael is the eldest son of the John McMichael, a former leader of the Loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA). He left school in his native Lisburn in 1985, and began working with the civil service, although he subsequently also worked as a youth worker and an insurance salesman.Gary McMichael, An Ulster Voice: In Search of Common Ground in Northern Ireland, Roberts Rinehart, 1999, pp. 16‚Äì17 He became involved in local protests against the Anglo-Irish Agreement soon after it was signed.McMichael, An Ulster Voice, p. 18 McMichael joined the Lisburn Club, the local branch of the pan-unionist Ulster Clubs movement that his father had helped to establish, and for a while served as chairman of this branch.McMichael, An Ulster Voice, p. 19-20 John McMichael was killed on 22 December 1987 and Gary McMichael was informed by police when his name was read out over the public address system at the Ulster Hall in Belfast, where he was attending a concert.McMichael, An Ulster Voice, p. 26-27 In 1988 McMichael became involved with the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party (as the UDP was then known).McMichael, An Ulster Voice, p. 32 He served as election co-ordinator for the group and helped to ensure the election of Ken Kerr to Derry City Council in 1989.McMichael, An Ulster Voice, p. 34-35 He was the UDP candidate in the 1990 Upper Bann by-election, when he finished eighth with 600 votes in a contest won by David Trimble.Westminster By-Election (NI) 17 May 1990 Although he regularly gave political advice to the UDA's controlling Inner Council, he was never a member of the paramilitary organisation, concentrating solely on the political wing.Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004, p. 191 McMichael became a close ally of Ray Smallwoods, serving his political apprenticeship under the UDP chairman.McMichael, An Ulster Voice, p. 40-41 Smallwoods was killed in 1994 and McMichael succeeded him as UDP leader. Although McMichael roundly condemned the killing of Smallwoods he later conceded that the shooting of Smallwoods, as well as that of Joe Bratty and Raymie Elder soon afterwards, convinced him that a Provisional IRA ceasefire was near as all three had been long-standing targets for the republican group.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 189 UDP leader As leader of the UDP, McMichael became attached to the Combined Loyalist Military Command, and played a leading role in convincing the CLMC to call a ceasefire in October 1994.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 274 When the ceasefire was announced from Fernhill House in Glencairn, McMichael was one of the six, along with UDP colleagues John White and David Adams and Progressive Unionist Party leaders Gusty Spence, \\"Plum\\" Smith and Jim McDonald, who delivered the statement confirming the cessation. A few days later McMichael, along with Adams, Spence, Joe English, David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson, took part in a tour of the United States where they presented the loyalist case publicly to a number of bodies.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 275 McMichael in particular received widespread coverage after he said in a speech to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy that if the Provisional IRA ceasefire proved legitimate then it was imperative for unionist leaders to hold talks with Sinn F√©in, something the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were refusing to countenance.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 276 He was also part of a loyalist delegation to 10 Downing Street in June 1996 aimed at avoiding the possibility of the cancellation of the CLMC ceasefire.Peter Taylor, Loyalists, London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 241 McMichael became a high- profile figure due to his involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process and he led the UDP into the Forum in 1996 from which the Belfast Agreement emerged. McMichael became an enthusiastic advocate of the Agreement, although his views were not always shared by the UDA membership as a whole and the party failed to win any seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. McMichael himself stood in Lagan Valley and only failed to capture one of the six seats by a narrow margin.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 303 Following the killing of Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright in late 1997, McMichael held a personal meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam in which he convinced her that, to avoid a breach of the ceasefire due to the popularity of Wright, they needed to engage with UDA prisoners. Mowlam herself, as well as McMichael, entered HMP Maze to meet with the paramilitary leaders and after extensive negotiations emerged with an undertaking that they would not sanction retaliation.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and C Company, Mainstream, 2004, pp. 252‚Äì255 McMichael, whose position was seen as weakened by some more hawkish members due to his own lack of a track record as a paramilitary, was supported in his efforts by Jackie McDonald, a leading figure within the UDA and close ally of John McMichael.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, pp. 214‚Äì215 However, the guarantee was ignored by the UDA West Belfast Brigade, with Stephen McKeag carrying out several retaliatory murders in what proved a blow to McMichael's leadership.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 260 Sammy Duddy would later admit that UDA activity in the aftermath of Wright's killing was kept from McMichael and McMichael subsequently claimed that when he went to the Inner Council to appeal to them to respect the ceasefire they told him the UDA was not involved in any of the attacks, even though they were actually being carried out by UDA members.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, pp. 218‚Äì219 Leaving politics Although still a local councillor, McMichael's influence began to wane after the failure of 1998 and with the movement of Johnny Adair towards the Loyalist Volunteer Force and the resulting loyalist feud, he became an increasingly peripheral figure along with the UDP as a whole.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 306 As elements within the UDA returned to violence in 1999, using the Red Hand Defenders cover name, McMichael was largely in the dark as to whether or not the UDA were involved.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 235 He entered virtual political retirement, concentrating instead on writing a column for Ireland on Sunday and publishing his autobiography, An Ulster Voice, in 1999.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 315 He did emerge briefly for negotiations with David Ervine aimed at ending the feuds, although these came to nothing.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 340 He was appointed to the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland,\\"Order protest over Civic Forum\\", BBC News but McMichael's career in politics was effectively ended by the collapse of the UDP in 2001.

The illusion continues to be performed by professional and amateur magicians. Effect In presentation, the magician demonstrates that the pan is empty and then fills it with a small quantity of a volatile liquid which is ignited. Often, the magician will place other items in the pan (e.g. cracking an egg into it) before setting the fuel on fire. To extinguish the fire, the magician slams the lid onto the pan. When the magician removes the lid, a dove flies from the pan which is shown to be otherwise empty. Method The gimmick of the dove pan lies in the design of the lid. The deep shouldered rim of the lid conceals an additional pan (or liner) that fits snugly into the main pan. When the lid is placed on the pan the liner is deposited inside it, resembling the main pan when it was displayed empty. The liner, when fitted into the lid, may be loaded with birds (or anything else the magician wishes to produce) before the trick begins. The magician must not show the underside of the lid to the audience while performing the trick. The effect consists of a shallow pan made of brass or aluminium and a matching lid which has a very deep rim or shoulder all around that fits inside the pan when closed. The pan is usually no more than ten inches in diameter and roughly 2-3 inches deep. Dove pans are a common item at magicians' supply stores. References *Hay, Harry. Cyclopedia of Magic.

Verstegan was born in East London the son of a cooper; his grandfather, Theodore Roland Verstegen, was a refugee from Guelders who arrived in England around the year 1500. Biography Under the patronym Rowlaunde, Richard went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1564, where he may have studied early English history and the Anglo-Saxon language. Having become a Catholic, he left the university without a degree to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy. Thereafter he was indentured to a goldsmith, and in 1574 became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. In 1576 he published a guidebook to Western Europe, translated from German, entitled The Post of the World. At the end of 1581 he secretly printed an account of the execution of Edmund Campion but was discovered and 'being apprehended, brake out of England'. In exile he resumed the surname of Verstegen (Anglicized Verstegan). While in Paris he was briefly imprisoned at the insistence of the English Ambassador; in Rome, he was the recipient of a short-lived pension from the pope. In both of these cities he published accounts of the suffering of priests in England. In 1585 or 1586 he moved to Antwerp, and set up in business as a publisher and engraver, an intelligencer, and a smuggler of books and people. From 1617 to about 1630 Verstegan was a prolific writer in Dutch, producing epigrams, characters, jestbooks, polemics. He also penned journalistic commentaries, satires and editorials for the Nieuwe Tijdinghen (New Tidings) printed in Antwerp by Abraham Verhoeven from 1620 to 1629.Paul Arblaster, From Ghent to Aix: How They Brought the News in the Habsburg Netherlands (Leiden and Boston, 2014), pp. 92-93.

Victory lap at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix A victory lap (also lap of honor) is a term used in motorsports to describe an extra lap of the race track after the conclusion of a race. This lap, driven at reduced speed, allows the winning driver to celebrate their victory and gives the spectators an opportunity to congratulate and honor the competitors. Commonly, trackside flag marshals will wave their flags in a gesture known as the FIA salute or the Monkey Dance in the US. It is not uncommon for marshals to clap or wave their hands at drivers as a gesture and sometimes the drivers wave back in response. Victory laps can sometime become dangerous for the winner and the other drivers, since in many tracks the safety nets can be easily climbed over by the crowd, which then becomes an obstacle for the racers. Victory laps have regularly seen drivers who have retired in the final stages of a race being given a lift back to the pits on one of their competitors' cars. Some notable examples in Formula One include Riccardo Patrese and Didier Pironi at the 1982 Monaco Grand Prix, Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna at the 1991 British Grand Prix (pictured), Jean Alesi and Michael Schumacher at the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher and Giancarlo Fisichella at the 1997 German Grand Prix, Mika H√§kkinen and David Coulthard at the 2001 Spanish Grand Prix, and Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso at the 2011 German Grand Prix and 2013 Singapore Grand Prix and Sebastian Vettel and Pascal Wehrlein at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix. Recently, the FIA, motor sport's world governing body, have restricted what a Formula One driver may do on his victory lap. The sporting regulations state that at the end of a race, \\"all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post race parc ferm√© without stopping, without overtaking (unless clearly necessary), without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary).\\"FIA Sporting Regulations FIA.com. Retrieved 23 October 2006 Polish victory lap A winning ice racing driver taking a Polish Victory Lap on a frozen Wisconsin lake A Polish, or Kulwicki victory lap entails the driver turning his car around and driving in the opposite direction, which is clockwise on NASCAR ovals. It has been used in road courses. This style of victory lap is common in local short track or dirt track races, where the victorious driver takes the checkered flag from the flag stand, and then proceeds to drive with the driver's side of the car facing the fans for their victory lap. The term was first coined as a result of Polish American Alan Kulwicki's celebration of his first career Winston Cup victory at the Checker 500 (Phoenix) on November 6, 1988. He celebrated his victory by driving a clockwise victory lap. Kulwicki first became familiar with the practice after meeting(s) with Midwest dirt track racer Fred Zack, who had been performing the backwards lap for many years prior. A Ford engineer slapped him on the back and asked if that was a \\"Polish\\" victory lap. Kulwicki's only other Polish Victory lap came in 1992, in celebration of his Winston Cup Championship at the 1992 Hooters 500. The term was solidified after Kulwicki's death. Kulwicki died in a plane crash on Thursday, April 1, 1993, near Blountville, Tennessee. Hours after Kulwicki's death, Peter Jellen drove Kulwicki's racecar hauler counter-clockwise around Bristol Motor Speedway before leaving the track. Two days after Kulwicki's death, Bristol Busch Series race winner Michael Waltrip honored his old short track foe by turning Kulwicki's trademark reverse Polish Victory Lap, but only half a lap, stating that he didn't want to do Kulwicki's entire routine. The next day, Winston Cup winner Rusty Wallace followed Waltrip's lead,Rusty's last bash; Jerry Bonkowski; Yahoo!, August 25, 2005, Retrieved March 5, 2008 and proceeded to run a full Polish Victory Lap, both after that race, and after each victory for the rest of the 1993 season. Tom Roberts, Wallace's and sponsor Miller Brewing's publicist, was also Kulwicki's publicist. In addition, most winners for the remainder of the 1993 season honored Kulwicki with a Polish victory lap. On November 14, 1993, after the Hooters 500 (Atlanta), the last race of that season, the race winner Wallace and 1993 series champion Dale Earnhardt ran a Polish Victory Lap together while carrying #7 and #28 flags commemorating Kulwicki and Davey Allison, respectively. Mike Joy frequently refers to this as an \\"Alan Kulwicki victory lap\\" in memory of the driver, and noted the spectators see the driver, who usually waves and sometimes has his helmet off, as he salutes the fans. Joy's term is reminiscent of other cases where a term is named for the person who developed the idea (i.e., Gurney flap, Petty bar). Dale Earnhardt, Jr. did a Polish victory lap after winning the 2001 MBNA Cal Ripken, Jr. 400 at Dover Downs International Speedway in the first NASCAR Winston Cup Race following the September 11 attacks while holding a large American flag out the driver's side window. Jimmie Johnson celebrated a special win by doing a Polish victory lap on October 31, 2004 after winning the 2004 Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The week before on October 24,tragedy struck when a Hendrick Motorsports airplane crashed outside of Martinsville, Virginia. Kurt Busch celebrated his 2005 win at Phoenix with a Polish victory lap. Busch watched his first NASCAR races at the track, and wanted to honor Kulwicki. Kyle Busch also did a Polish Victory Lap after his 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup win at Bristol. Many local racetrack winners and series champions have saluted Kulwicki or his underdog spirit with a Polish victory lap, especially in his home state of Wisconsin. 2006 Milwaukee (Wisconsin) race winner Paul Menard (a Wisconsinite) celebrated his first Busch Series win with a Polish Victory lap.Paul Menard captures first career Busch Series victory in Milwaukee; Motorsport Today Kurt Busch, with his win at Atlanta in Sprint Cup, 2009, ended up putting the car in reverse and driving it around the track backwards. His brother Kyle also used this after his win in Bristol. The practice was later dubbed, \\"The Unwind Lap\\". In 2012, Tony Stewart did a Polish victory lap after finally winning for the first time at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in the Kobalt Tools 400. In 2014, Earnhardt, Jr. celebrated his Daytona 500 victory with a Polish victory lap. His second win of the 2014 season came on June 8 at Pocono, where he repeated it. He also performed the feat after winning the Goody's Headache Relief Shot 500 in October. In 2015, Denny Hamlin celebrated his Nationwide Series in his home state track at Richmond International Raceway with a Polish Victory Lap, and completing it while performing a burnout.

According to the Act, the objects of the PA are, among other things:People's Association Act, above, ss. 8(a)‚Äì(c). > (a) the organisation and the promotion of group participation in social, > cultural, educational and athletic activities for the people of Singapore in > order that they may realise that they belong to a multiracial community, the > interests of which transcend sectional loyalties; (b) the establishment of > such institutions as may be necessary for the purpose of leadership training > to instil in leaders a sense of national identity and a spirit of dedicated > service to a multiracial community; (c) the fostering of community bonding > and strengthening of social cohesion amongst the people of Singapore; (d) > the performance of such other functions as may be conferred upon the > Association by any written law; and (e) the carrying out of such activities > as appear to the Board to be advantageous towards, or necessary or > convenient for, the furtherance of the objects of the Association as set out > in paragraphs (a) to (d). According to the Central Intelligence Agency of the US government, the People's Association had its origins as a national building programme 'designed to wean pro-Communist voters away from the opposition'. Besides serving as a communication channel between the government and ruling party at the top and the people below - making way for a more responsive government - it was also intended for the PA to blur the boundaries between the government and the party, such that 'the people tended to praise the party for activities undertaken by the government'.Kimball, Walter B. \\"Singapore's People's Association\\", CIA Historical Review Programme, 22 September 1993, accessed 16 May 2011. Management According to the People's Association Act, the Association consists of:People's Association Act, above, ss. 4(1)(a)‚Äì(d). #the Prime Minister, who is Chairman of the Association; #a Minister (typically a member of The Cabinet Of Singapore) who is to be appointed by the Chairman as Deputy Chairman; #eight other members to be appointed by the Chairman; and #one member to be appointed by the Chairman in consultation with each of the organisations mentioned in the First Schedule to the Act. More than 80 civic organisations are listed in the First Schedule, ranging from the Football Association of Singapore, to the National University of Singapore Society, to the Singapore Stamp Club.These organisations are also listed on the PA's website: see The powers of the PA and the management and control of the Association and its property and affairs are vested in the Board of Management.People's Association Act, above, s. 3. The Board consists of the persons mentioned in the first three categories listed above, and four members who are elected from among themselves by the persons mentioned in the fourth category at a general meeting of the Association. The Secretary-Treasurer of the Association is also the Secretary-Treasurer of the Board.People's Association Act, above, s. 5(1). = Concerns on partisanship = Concerns have been raised as to whether the management of the PA, a statutory board, should be less politicised. The governing People's Action Party (PAP) has traditionally fielded candidates who are leaders and advisors active in PA grassroots organisations before each generation election, and Residents' Committees and Community Clubs have encouraged the public to support PAP candidates at rallies and electoral events. Opposition MPs were not allowed to be advisors to government-run grassroots bodies. A spokesperson for the People's Association clarified on a newspaper forum in 2011 that grassroots advisers are appointed by the government; advisors are expected to support and execute its programmes, and the opposition members were not expected to do so. In 2011, after the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency was won by the Workers Party (WP) in the general elections, WP chairman Sylvia Lim noted that the Housing Development Board had informed the incoming Aljunied‚ÄìHougang Town Council (won by the WP) that it had leased 26 public sites, including fields and hard courts, to the People's Association, and that the PA has informed them that \\"booking by WP will not be allowed\\". She argued that the move is a move to curtail the \\"ground presence\\" of the elected Members of Parliament (MP) in the opposition-held wards. Opposition leader Low Thia Khiang added that temples were allowed to hold activities in his constituency only if they have supporting letters from the grassroots organisations, and not from him as the elected MP. Non-PAP endorsed politicians such as Chen Show Mao and Tan Cheng Bock (for the presidential elections) were uninvited to PA events. In response to allegations of partisanship of the association, minister in the Prime Minister's Office and deputy chairman of PA Chan Chun Sing stated in 2016 that the PA \\"executes the directions for the Government of the day, as per any statutory board. The PA does not allow any political activity or canvassing on our premises or in our activities. And we certainly do not mobilise anyone for any political party.\\" =Lapses in governance= On 15 July 2015, the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) annual audit report flagged lapses in governance. It highlighted that 35 of 91 Community Club/Centre Management Committees (CCMCs) had awarded $17.78 million worth of tenancy contracts without proper approval. In another case, Admiralty CCC's Chairman had approved $114,767 worth of claims to himself and two contracts worth $32,000 of which he had a conflict of interest; he has resigned voluntarily. PA deputy chairman Lim Swee Say told Parliament that most of the non- compliance flagged shows no systemic irregularity. He explained many of the cases while accepting that processes can be reviewed. Grassroots organisations Starting with 28 community centres, the PA has over 1,800 grassroots organisations (GROs) with more than 25,000 volunteer grassroots leaders as of 2017. Grassroots volunteers visit residents to encourage community involvement, raise awareness about community issues, explain government policies and gather feedback, as well as help those in need. It has since grew to 109 Community Centers islandwide as of 2020. Grassroots volunteers and leaders who have volunteered for more than two years qualify for various benefits, such as priority for their children's primary school placement, priority in the application for flats, free parking at government housing estates (for grassroots work related), and free courses paid by the government (under NACLI, this is to impart knowledge of what they have learnt to the ground, and to re-enforce their required skills in times of crisis). Prior to each general election, prospective candidates of the People's Action Party are sometimes attached to the member of parliament for each constituency to do grassroots work at various GROs, if they were not PAP branch activists, or had not worked with the National Trade Union Congress and government-linked grassroots previously. Staff at the PA are fully paid and do not take part in any decision-making processes. They are only to provide support to the GROs, which include the Citizens' Consultative Committees, Community Club Management Committees, Residents' Committees in public housing estates and Neighbourhood Committees in private housing estates. =Citizens' Consultative Committees= The Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) is the umbrella grassroots organisation in a constituency in Singapore. CCCs plan and lead grassroots activities in a constituency, they oversee community and welfare programmes and they also act as a feedback channel between the government and the people.Bilveer Singh, Politics and Governance in Singapore (Singapore, 2007), p. 68. The first CCC was created in January 1965 to carry out the following functions: > i. To transmit information and make recommendations on the needs of the > people to the government, and to keep people informed of government action > and policy in these matters. ii. To promote good citizenship amongst the > people of Singapore.The Citizens' Consultative Committee Rules (Singapore, > Government Printers, 1974), quoted in Bilveer Singh, Politics and Governance > in Singapore (Singapore, 2007), p. 68. Following the 1964 race riots in Singapore, village and clan leaders in the CCCs were mobilised to help maintain racial harmony.Hussin Mutalib, Parties and Politics: A Study of Opposition Parties and the PAP in Singapore (Second Edition) (Singapore, 2004), p. 287. The committee helps to execute government campaigns such those for as dengue prevention, cleanliness and recycling, racial and communal cohesion. They also organise community forums and administer welfare assistance. Members in the CCC are volunteers appointed by the chairman once every two years and this appointment has to be approved by the adviser, which is the member of parliament for each constituency. In the case of an opposition-held ward, where the sitting MP is prohibited from being an adviser to the PA, the People's Action Party's candidate for the next general election will be made the adviser to the GRO. Members usually have a background in politics, or are significant contributors in the Singapore scene. In 2015, the Singapore Auditor-General's Office flagged several financial irregularities in procurement and payment in multiple CCCs. The Admiralty CCC chairman had approved his own monetary claims of S$114,767, three of which had no supporting documents. He was also involved in approving of two contracts to a company where he held a senior management position. Another CCC member who was in charge of approval process was both a director and a shareholder of the company. PA deputy chairman and cabinet minister Lim Swee Say defended the financial non-compliance by these grassroots leaders and said these irregularities were borne out of \\"good intentions\\". =Community Club Management Committees= Community Club Management Committees provide recreational activities and learning opportunities. Each CC serves about 15,000 households or an average of 50,000 people. The CCMCs manage and oversees all the CCs. CCMCs are made up of volunteers who work with full-time staff to manage the CCs. =Residents' Network= Residents' Committees (RCs) were first established in 1978 in two constituencies in Singapore (Tanjong Pagar and Marine Parade) with the aim of promoting neighbourly interaction, good communal relations and overall cohesion.Kenneth Paul Andrew Sze-Sian Tan, 'Democracy and the Grassroots Sector in Singapore', Space and Polity 7 (1) (2003), p. 3. RCs also serve as channels of communication between residents and the Government. RCs, like CCCs, initially came under the Prime Minister's Office, and later, the Ministry of Community Development. In 1993, RCs and CCCs came under the purview of the PA. Currently, there are over 650 RCs. Each RC has an RC Centre to conduct meetings and programmes and activities for residents. RCs organise residents' parties, conduct house visits and other neighbourhood activities to reach out to residents. They also work closely with the government agencies to improve the living environment, safety and security of their estates. The Residents' Committee are run by volunteers. The committee has since changed its name to Residents Network (RN). Existing Residents Committee may continue to use its current name. =Youth Network= The T-Net Club (Teens Network Club), part of the People's Association network, is a non-profit teens organisation.It organises a wide range of activities to engage teenagers and develop their potential. These include educational, social/recreational, cultural and performing arts, sporting and community service activities. Over the years, the T-Net Club has developed several flagship events such as the T-Net Club Sports Fiesta, T-Net Club Premier League, T-Net Club Basketball Tournament, and the T-Net Club ‚ÄúBowl with a Heart‚Äù Community Service Project. Together with the Educational Series in Mathematics, History, Chinese and Malay, and the Sudoku and Sports Quizzes, these events help extend the Club's outreach to the teenage community. In 2019, the committee has changed its name from Youth Executive Committee to Youth Network. =Community Emergency and Engagement Committees= The Community Emergency and Engagement (C2E) Committees is the community Emergency Preparedness (EP) Unit formed in each constituency. The C2E Committees is the amalgamation of the former Emergency Preparedness Group and Civil Defence Executive Committees. C2E Committees help strengthen community resilience by involving residents, grassroots leaders, educational institutions, business, religious, voluntary welfare organisations and other community partners in Community Emergency Preparedness programmes. Each of the 84 constituencies has formed a C2E Committees to enhance our capability to effectively respond to, and quickly recover from any emergency. The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) is an organised group of volunteers equipped with special training to respond to an emergency and assist the community in the recovery process. The main role of the CERT is to strengthen the emergency response capabilities of the local community. Being closer to the ground, they can respond to an emergency before the arrival of the emergency authorities. Members receive the following trainings: Community Emergency Preparedness Programme (CEPP, Standard First Aid Training (with 3 years certification), Basic Cardiac Life Support Course (with 2 years certification), and Crisis Intervention Workshop. Community Development Councils First established in 1997, Community Development Councils (CDCs) were formed to help build a more cohesive, compassionate and self-reliant society. Initially, the CDCs offered local programmes to meet the needs of the residents in their districts. From 2001, the delivery of social services, including the development of childcare, student care and family care centres was devolved from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to the CDCs. As CDCs are closer to the ground, they are better able than government ministries to promptly address the needs of residents. The CDCs also play an important role in mobilising the community to help needy residents, including giving them interim financial assistance and helping them find jobs. The CDCs offer services identified under the common strategic goals of 'ABC': Assisting the Needy,Bonding the People, and Connecting the Community. Each of the current five CDCs ‚Äì Central Singapore, North East, North West, South East and South West. ‚Äì is headed by a mayor who is assisted by a council comprising up to 80 council members. Unlike other countries, mayors in Singapore are not directly elected because the CDCs are not a system of local government, but local administrators of community and social services. Community Clubs When self-government was attained in 1959, many Singaporeans were faced with poor employment prospects and had little opportunity for skills training. Recreational, social and sports facilities were few and far in between. The PA converted former food distribution centres set up by the British administration into community centres. These centres were venues for residents of all walks of life to get together to learn a skill, engage in social and leisure activities, and forge a sense of community. Over the years, with economic progress, community centres have evolved into Community Clubs (CCs) offering a wide range of courses, activities, programmes and facilities to match the changing needs of residents. The Clubs are run by a group of volunteers called CC Management Committee. The functions of the Committee are: (a) to manage the Community Centre/Club for and on behalf of the People's Association; (b) to promote social, cultural, educational, sports and recreational activities for the residents in the neighbourhood of the Community Centre/Club; (c) to disseminate information on Government policies, and to transmit to the Government information on the needs and aspirations of the residents in the neighbourhood of the Community Centre/Club; and (d) to promote good citizenship among residents in the neighbourhood of the Community Centre/Club. Other PA organisations In addition to its network of grassroots organisations, the PA also operates the PA Youth Movement, National Community Leadership Institute and a water sport club called PAssion WaVe. =National Community Leadership Institute= NACLI or National Community Leadership Institute is the training facility of PA, established in 1964. It conducts workshops, facilitates workplan retreats, and organises dialogues and other learning events. The Institute anchors its training and development of grassroots leaders on the Community LEAD framework; a comprehensive and holistic approach to developing core leadership competencies in grassroots leaders. NACLI also collaborates with Institutes of Higher Learning to offer Joint Certification Programmes as part of its curriculum. The Institute's training and accommodation facilities are available for rental, and based on availability of resources, NACLI also conducts student leadership and corporate teambuilding programmes. =PAssion WaVe (PAWV)= The PAssion WaVe (PAWV), formerly known as Water-Venture, offers a range of land and water sports activities like sports climbing, abseiling, kayaking, sailing, dragon boating, windsurfing and power boating to the community. Interesting children's programmes are also offered. In October 2014, PAWV took on a new portfolio to spread awareness to the community & initiate a call-to- action to protect our environment through waste management and a change in our everyday behaviour. Currently, there are six PAWV outlets island-wide, which are run by professional staff and assisted by a dedicated pool of trainers and volunteers. =PA Youth Movement= The People's Association Youth Movement (PAYM) is Singapore's largest youth organisation. Started in 1971, the PAYM caters to youths aged 12 to 35 years old It is a two-tiered organisation, comprising 101 Youth Clubs based in the Community Clubs and the Central Youth Council. Some of the youth-inspired events that PAYM has organised include \\"City Alive! 2009\\", Singapore's Biggest Dance Party; \\"YOUTHSpeak on Budget 2009\\", a National-level Policy Forum; and \\"Heart to Heart We Serve the Community\\", a series of community service activities. Overseas community service projects include trips to Cambodia, Maldives and China, such as Project \\"INitiate\\"; and Hip Hop competition \\"Pop Culture\\" amongst other international exchanges. PA Talents PA Talents is an umbrella group for more than 300 part-time musicians and dancers performing traditional, ethnic art forms. In 2006, Cultural Medallion recipient Dick Lee was appointed its creative director. Formerly known as the PA Cultural Talents, it was set up in 1965 as a performing unit with full-time performers to bring arts and cultural performances to the masses by performing in community centres. It was one of the first groups in Singapore to create multi-ethnic performances in the early 1980s. In 1997, following a strategic review, the group ceased having full- time performers due to limited resources and now relies on a pool of part- timers. PA Talents consists of ten groups: five orchestras (Orkestra Melayu Singapura, the PA Youth Chinese Orchestra, the Singapore Indian Orchestra and Choir, the Singapore Pipe Band and the Singapore Pop Orchestra), and five dance groups (the Chinese, Indian, Malay and Modern Dance Groups, and a hip- hop club). About a hundred performances are staged each year in national and grassroots shows such as the National Day Parade and Chingay Parade, in commercial shows for corporations, and in cultural and diplomatic events in Singapore and abroad.

Examples of systems that operate in a repetitive manner include robot arm manipulators, chemical batch processes and reliability testing rigs. In each of these tasks the system is required to perform the same action over and over again with high precision. This action is represented by the objective of accurately tracking a chosen reference signal r(t) on a finite time interval. Repetition allows the system to improve tracking accuracy from repetition to repetition, in effect learning the required input needed to track the reference exactly. The learning process uses information from previous repetitions to improve the control signal ultimately enabling a suitable control action can be found iteratively. The internal model principle yields conditions under which perfect tracking can be achieved but the design of the control algorithm still leaves many decisions to be made to suit the application. A typical, simple control law is of the form: :u_{p+1}=u_p +K * e_p where u_p is the input to the system during the pth repetition, e_p is the tracking error during the pth repetition and K is a design parameter representing operations on e_p. Achieving perfect tracking through iteration is represented by the mathematical requirement of convergence of the input signals as p becomes large whilst the rate of this convergence represents the desirable practical need for the learning process to be rapid. There is also the need to ensure good algorithm performance even in the presence of uncertainty about the details of process dynamics. The operation K is crucial to achieving design objectives and ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization computations.

The Yeoman Plotter was a plotter used on ships and boats to transfer GPS coordinates or RADAR echo locations onto a paper navigation chart and to read coordinates from the chart. It was manufactured from 1985 to 2014/2015 and was an intermediary step between traditional paper chart navigation and full electronic chart displays. It was easy to understand for people that were accustomed to paper charts and much cheaper than electronic chart displays available at the time. The continuing fall in prices of electronic chart displays, their increase in functionality such as radar overlay and the advent of cheap tablets eventually made the Yeoman plotter uncompetitive. Construction The plotter consists of a plotting surface impregnated with fine wires and a moveable \\"mouse\\" containing a sensing ring. The mouse's location on the surface can be electronically sensed. To use the plotter, a conventional paper chart is first fixed in position on the surface (the method of fixing varies between the different models of plotter; see below). It is then \\"registered\\" - the mouse is placed over three known points on the chart and a button pressed at each. Knowing the location on the surface of these points, the system can interpolate the mouse's position anywhere on the chart. In the 1990s charts in some countries had plotter reference points printed on them, and the coordinates of these points were pre-programmed in the Yeoman unit. Other charts needed the input of the reference points to be manually added. Although the device can provide some useful data on its own (positions of charted objects, distances and bearings between points), in practice it is invariably linked to a source of position data such as GPS. This enables many useful features, the most important of which is the fixing on the chart of the vessel's current position. In position mode, four illuminated arrows around a transparent area on the mouse are used. The device is pushed across the chart, following the arrows, until all four of them are extinguished. This indicates that the mouse is directly over the vessel's current position on the chart; if required, a pencil can be poked through a small hole to mark the fix on the chart. After a couple of goes, this procedure becomes instinctive and very fast. The mouse can also be used to obtain the range and bearing from the vessel's current position to any other object, simply by placing it over that object on the chart and reading the figures from the display. If a suitable radar is fitted it can be combined with the Yeoman plotter for navigation in poor visibility. In one mode, the position of the mouse on the chart is reflected in a cursor on the radar display - the mouse can be placed over a charted object to identify its echo on the radar, which is very useful for objects whose reflection may not be obvious. Similarly, a position from the radar screen can be sent to the Yeoman - the mouse is moved by hand following the illuminated arrows as for plotting a fix, and is guided to the location of the radar return. Advantages The way in which the Yeoman plotter combines speedy GPS position fixing with a paper chart is cited as a benefit for two principal reasons. The first is one of safety and reliability - even the best marine electronics fail from time to time, and if the boat's electronic instruments should cease to work then a recent pencil plot on a paper chart becomes extremely valuable. Because such a fix can be made on a Yeoman in around two seconds, it is likely to be updated far more frequently. The fact that the correct chart is guaranteed to be on board, up to date, and open on the chart table ready for reversion to traditional navigation is also an aspect to consider as video chart plotters become more widely used. The second benefit of the Yeoman plotter over an electronic chart display is cited less often, but to most of its users is the more important - they find it easier to use. While video plotter technology is improving every year, they still must display their charts on relatively small screens, with input via a single small joystick and a few buttons. By contrast, a printed chart on a Yeoman Navigator provides a 35-inch \\"display\\" at extremely high resolution, that one can draw on, make notes upon, and use for traditional operations with dividers and rulers, combined with instant (permanent!) position fixes and range-and- bearing information from the Yeoman mouse. This mixing of technology and traditional techniques was quite effective.  Versions  Yeoman made four versions of their plotter for different situations: ; Maxi : Designed to be installed on the bridge of large ships, this is a self-contained chart table up to A0 (approximately 33\\"x47\\") in size. ; Navigator : Regarded as the \\"normal\\" Yeoman, this is a 28\\"x21\\" pad of mousemat-like material, with a control box attached in one corner and six separate clips to secure the chart or the chart can be alternatively be secured using an option called the ClearView which is a transparent flexible screen under which the chart is inserted. This plotter is designed to be used on the chart table of a yacht, connected to the vessel's GPS system. It can in fact be built into the table if required; a menu setting reverses the position data so that it works properly when glued upside-down to the underneath of the tabletop - the mouse can work accurately through up to two centimeters of timber. ; Compact : For the smaller chart table measuring approximately 24\\" x 20\\" which has all the same features as the Navigator ; Sport : A portable version of the Yeoman designed to be used in the cockpit of yachts or in open boats. It incorporated a waterproof cover for the chart and velcro straps to hold it in place. The manufacturing rights for Yeoman Plotters were purchased by Precision Navigation Ltd in 2004 and production has been relocated to East Anglia (UK). In 2014 the ownership of Precision Navigation transferred to Charity & Taylor and production ceased.

Figures show that for the 10 years preceding 2015, the Northern Territory (NT) had a consistently higher per capita rate for homicide and manslaughter than other Australian states and territories, as well as a high level of assaults. Most assaults and murders were related to domestic violence, and most of these were alcohol-related. NT also has the lowest population and the highest level of social disadvantage of the states and territories. The crime rate in Alice Springs (population c. 24,000) is higher than that of Darwin (population c. 132,000). Crime across the Territory The Northern Territory Police are responsible for law enforcement, the Department of the Attorney-General and Justice presides over the courts and prisons, and Northern Territory Families runs youth justice and detention centres across the Territory. Aboriginal people are disproportionately represented as both perpetrators and victims, and many of the victims are women. Data collated over the 10 years up to 2015 by the Australian Institute of Criminology's National Homicide Monitoring Program showed that the Northern Territory had a consistently higher per capita rate for murder and manslaughter than other Australian states and territories. Most assaults and homicides were related to domestic violence and most of these were alcohol-related. In September 2016, the level of domestic violence in Aboriginal communities in NT was described as \\"out of control\\" by the Northern Territory Coroner, Greg Cavanagh. More than half of homicides and assaults were related to domestic violence and the overwhelming majority of victims were Aboriginal women. He recommended new laws to target and monitor repeat offenders; the use of body cameras by police, with footage able to be used as evidence, so that victims would not always need to appear in court; restricting alcohol supplies; and other strategies. =Demographics= It also has the lowest population of Australian states and territories, at 245,800 , with many living in very remote areas, Estimated Resident Population 1 December 2018 and the highest level of social disadvantage and the highest proportion of Aboriginal people of all states and territories, at around 30% of the population in 2016. Much of the population is concentrated in Darwin (148,564), with 98,763 people spread across the rest of the Territory (2018 figures). =2014 Safe Streets Audit= The 2014 Northern Territory Safe Streets Audit by the Australian Institute of Criminology and Charles Darwin University's Northern Institute reported findings from previous research as well as the results drawn from focus groups. \\"Factors that may contribute to heightened levels of fear in the Northern Territory include increased risk of victimisation for both violent and property crime, perceptions that crime is more frequent and serious than it actually is, lower levels of confidence in police and the impact of sensationalist media coverage.\\" The Audit analysed articles in the Centralian Advocate, NT News and Sunday Territorian for each of the first weeks of May in 2010, 2011 and 2012, which showed that between six and ten percent of news coverage was devoted to crime. Crimes involving violence, especially sexual violence, were over-represented compared with other crime types. Although victims' and offenders' indigeneity were typically not identified, crimes featuring Indigenous offenders and non-Indigenous victims received greater coverage than other crimes in the weeks studied. However the report noted that fear reduction strategies were not as effective as targeting actual crime and offending. Noting evidence of crime \\"hotspots\\", the high incidence of domestic violence and the correlation with alcohol, it said \\"there is a need to implement evidence-based crime reduction strategies targeting both acute and chronic hotspots, as well as strategies that can reduce alcohol consumption and related harms, reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous people as victims and offenders of violent crime and respond to high rates of domestic violence\\". =2017 Riley Review targets alcohol= A review in October 2017 by former chief justice Trevor Riley brought about huge changes to the Northern Territory's alcohol policies. The 220 recommendations included a floor price for all alcohol products at per standard drink, the reinstatement of an independent Liquor Commission, a complete rewrite of the Liquor Act (expected to take a year), and introducing licensing inspectors to help police at liquor outlets. =Recent trends= In the year ending July 2019, the number of reported house break-ins across the Territory had reached its highest level since 2009, after a dip around 2015‚Äì6, but commercial break- ins had dropped. The rates in Alice Springs, Katherine and Palmerson were above average, but Darwin was below average. However, all categories of assault had dropped. Alcohol-related assaults were 24.2% below the previous year's figure, and 20% below the long-term average. Domestic-violence-related assault had dropped 11.66% against the previous year, and general assaults had dropped by 15.67%. Overall, crimes against the person had dropped 14.67% against the previous year, and crimes against property 1.71%. The per capita offending rate had dropped in most categories, with the exception of house break-ins (17.07% up) and motor vehicle theft (0.8% up). Reduction in alcohol-related crime In the 10 months between 1 October 2018, the date that the alcohol floor price of a minimum of per standard drink and various other measures were imposed by the NT government following the Riley Review, and 31 July 2019, there was a 26% decrease in alcohol-related assaults in the Territory. In Alice Springs there was a 43% reduction in alcohol-related assaults and a 38% reduction in domestic violence; Tennant Creek dropped 28% in both categories; and in the Darwin area, alcohol-related assaults 16% and domestic violence by 9%. Youth crime and justice In 2017‚Äì18 the number of young offenders (i.e. aged 10‚Äì17 years old) in NT decreased by 27 offenders, or 4%, over the previous year. The rate per capita of young offenders was marginally higher than Western Australia and New South Wales, at about 2.7 per 100. Often, a high proportion of the crime is perpetrated by repeat offenders. In Palmerston, up to 20 young people who at any given time regularly commit property and other offences have been identified, and youth represent 73.1% of apprehensions for break-ins. The NT Government created a new three-pronged strategy to target youth crime in the area, which included diversions, building a new youth justice facility and a new police station, and the creation of new recreation facilities and engagement programs. Violent crimes committed by young offenders are of particular concern. The Youth Justice Court hears charges against young offenders in NT; for particularly serious offences, cases may be transferred to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory for sentencing. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's Youth justice in Australia 2017‚Äì18 report showed that the rate of young people aged 10‚Äì17 under supervision orders was highest in the Northern Territory, at 59 per 10,000 (compared with 10 in Victoria), and also for those in detention (15 per 10,000; Victoria, 2 per 10,000). Crime in Alice Springs =21st century background and history= Crime has been a significant social issue in Alice Springs in the 21st century, as in most of the rest of the Territory. Both victims and perpetrators are disproportionately represented in the per capita statistics and a high proportion of the victims are women. In 2007, at the second reading of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007, preceding the controversial Intervention by the Howard government, Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough, described the Alice Springs Town Camps as \\"murder capitals\\". However, two 2009 studies showed that it was lower level-type of offending, such as traffic offences, that was responsible for most crimes committed by Aboriginal people in the NT. The 2009 crime statistics revealed that violent crime in the town had soared, with reported assaults up 29% on the previous year, the highest number (1432) since statistics had been publicly recorded, and double that of 2004. Alcohol had played a part in about 65% of assaults, and more than half of them were classed as domestic violence. The NT Southern Region Police Commander said that itinerancy, domestic violence and alcohol were the main factors driving up crime rates. The June 2010 report of the Northern Territory Justice Department's Quarterly Crime & Justice Statistics documented huge increases across multiple categories of crime in Alice Springs in the six years between the 2004 and 2010 reporting periods, largely due to the impact of the NT Police Force's \\"Violent Crime Reduction Strategy\\" introduced in 2004, which resulted in more offences being recorded and counted in the stats. Recorded cases of assault rose by 87%, sexual assault offences rose by 97%, house break-ins increased by 64%, commercial premises break-ins by 185%, and motor vehicle theft and related offences by 97% on 2004‚Äì05 figures. Compared with the previous reporting year, all categories except for commercial premises break-ins rose significantly. After a prolonged spike in crime in early 2011, especially break-ins committed by young offenders, concern about the high levels of crime led to a public meeting attended by 250 people in February 2011, organised by a citizens' group called Action for Alice. Aboriginal elder Lindsay Bookie addressed the crowd of mainly white residents, expressing the view that The Intervention of 2007 had caused a lot of bad people from remote communities to move to Alice. Action for Alice put the spotlight on crime using TV advertisements. The over-representation of Aboriginal people in the crime statistics, as both perpetrators and victims, was attributed in part to the movement of people into Alice Springs from remote communities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda said that poverty and social dysfunction in the town camps around Alice Springs were part of the cause, and welcomed recent spending by the federal government of on housing and social services in the camps. The town camps were notorious for their drinking, violence and substandard living conditions. In 2012, John McRoberts, Northern Territory Police Commissioner, said that there had been social dysfunction in Alice Springs over 30 years. Stephanie Bell, Director of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress said that there had been some positive changes brought about by government programs, but \\"the impact of years of neglect and failure of services and programs is now at a point where it is escalating beyond everyone's capacity, and we have to work collaboratively to address it\\". Assaults were common in Aboriginal town camps and 95% of people in the town fleeing domestic violence were Indigenous, sometimes filling a shelter housing 900 people. Housing in the 17 town camps, where people from remote communities stay when visiting Alice Springs for medical and other services, was very overcrowded, and the young people were looking for excitement when they came to town. In February 2013, Tangentyere Council called an emergency meeting of Territory government, police and other stakeholders, to address concerns among Alice Springs town camp residents, who were living in fear caused by alcohol abuse, violence and family feuding. However, several officials walked out. Camp residents later said that they felt abandoned by the Territory government. In 2015, NT police promised extra patrols for an upcoming sporting event, after the number of youth offenders across the Territory had doubled in the previous year. They would be working with Tangentyere Night Patrol, along with other night patrol teams from across Central Australia, and urged residents to help by reporting crime through the regular channels, after a vigilante group called the Alice Springs Volunteer Force (ASVF) were trying to recruit people with firearms experience on social media. The police had earlier launched Taskforce Neo to try to reduce the rates of youth crime in Alice Springs as well as remote areas. There was a spate of rock-throwing by youths in 2015 and 2016, targeting people, vehicles and buildings. At the end of 2017, youth crime was still causing concern in the community, after a series of violent assaults, brawls and robberies perpetrated by youths. At an Alice Springs Council meeting called by local Arrernte elders, Arrernte elder, former police officer and resident of nearby community Santa Teresa Phillip Alice said that the town was under siege, and that the young troublemakers were not local. The traditional owners said that they had had enough, and that Aboriginal people had to be part of the solution in making the town safe again. NT Police launched \\"Operation Shulton\\" in November, \\"...to target antisocial behaviour and associated crime\\". Police would be actively engaging with young people on the streets, and calling on the community to report crime. This was part of the multi-agency \\"Summer in Alice\\" campaign, described as \\"the biggest campaign by an NT government to target kids at risk before they engage in bad behaviour\\". was being invested in after-hours activities, including transport to get youths home if needed. Additional police were being recruited and trained in Alice Springs. Eight outreach workers from Territory Families Youth Outreach and Re-engagement Team (YORET) would work every night over the summer holidays. =2017 travel advisories= In 2017, the governments of the UK, Germany and Canada issued travel advisories to their citizens travelling in Australia, singling out Alice Springs as a place where extra precautions should be taken: \\"Take care in the town centre of Alice Springs at night. There have been a number of incidents of harassment, robberies and attacks (including sexual assault) on foreign tourists.\\" (UK). This was despite the fact that common assaults and sexual assaults fell 12.4 and 17.1 per cent respectively in Alice in 2016, and only one of the high-profile attacks on tourists in the 2010s actually took place in the town (a violent robbery and gang-rape; there were three others at other locations in the Territory between 2001 and 2017). Recent statistics showed that although tourist numbers to the whole Territory had fallen, Alice itself had seen a growth in tourist numbers. =Recent trends= The Alice Springs LGA for which statistics are collected represents about 12% of the NT population. Crime against persons showed a decline of 275% between 2017‚Äì8 and 2018‚Äì9, but at 6074 per 100,000 people, the figure was still nearly three times that of Darwin, at 2379 per 100,000. Crimes against property had risen 12%, at 17,948 per 100,000 (Darwin 8,163). Break-ins were the highest in the Territory, at 2,396 incidents per 100,000 people, which was 57% above the 10-year average (Katherine 1,201; Palmerston 922; Darwin 564). In the 10 months between 1 October 2018, the date that the alcohol floor price and various other measures were imposed by the NT government following the Riley Review (see above), and 31 July 2019, there was a 43% reduction in alcohol- related assaults and a 38% reduction in domestic violence. Crime in Darwin Darwin urban centre consists of Darwin City and the associated suburbs from Buffalo Creek, Berrimah and East Arm westwards, and represents approximately 35% of the Northern Territory's population. It does not include the Palmerston urban area, although both areas fall within the NT Police's Darwin Metropolitan Command. (Palmerston urban centre closely approximates the Palmerston Local Government Area, and represents approximately 13% of the Northern Territory's population.) Darwin has had lower crime rates than Alice Springs, but Darwin too has had a history of alcohol abuse and violent crime, with 6,000 assaults in 2009, of which 350 resulted in broken jaws and noses ‚Äì more than anywhere else in the world, according to the Royal Darwin Hospital. Mitchell Street, with its numerous pubs, clubs and other entertainment venues, was one of the areas policed by the CitySafe Unit, officially launched by the NT Chief Minister Paul Henderson on 25 February 2009, was credited with success in tackling alcohol abuse linked to crime, and the NT police were looking at establishing a specialist licensing enforcement unit in 2010. The First Response Patrol, run by Larrakia Nation, which helps to move homeless Indigenous women out of dangerous situations, was credited with the fall in sexual assaults in 2009. The service operates every day from 5am to 2am. =Recent trends= In the 10 months between 1 October 2018, the date that the alcohol floor price and various other measures were imposed by the NT government following the Riley Review, and 31 July 2019, alcohol-related assaults dropped by 16% and domestic violence by 9% in the Darwin area. The rate of offending in most categories of crime dropped in the Darwin area between 2018 and 2019, with the notable exceptions of motor vehicle theft and break-ins (both up about 12%). Apart from sexual assault, which rose from 21 to 46, all other categories of crime showed drops in Palmerston.

The book has been a bestseller in many countries since its first publication in 1980. The book initially had only modest sales, before Hal Kramer came out of retirement to republish the book, from the H. J. Kramer imprint of New World Library. In early 2006, a film based on the novel, Peaceful Warrior, was released. Summary The story tells of a chance meeting with a service station attendant who becomes a spiritual teacher to the young gymnast, Dan Millman. The attendant, whom Millman names Socrates, becomes a kind of father figure and teaches Millman how to become a \\"peaceful warrior\\". Plot Dan is a world-class trampolining gymnast attending college at the University of California, Berkeley. The story begins when Dan experiences a series of nightmares, where he is in a dark lane. In front of him is Death, about to claim his life, when an old man appears out of nowhere and confronts Death. One particular night, Dan heads out to an all night gas station, where he meets the same old man from his dreams. Dan, nervous, leaves immediately, but as he turns back, he sees the man standing on the roof. Surprised that he could move so quickly, Dan strikes up a conversation with the old man, and calls him Socrates. Dan begins to meet Socrates on a regular basis, and is interested in his philosophy. Socrates ridicules Dan, pointing out that he is trapped in the illusions created by his mind, causing Dan so much trouble. Dan keeps a diary and is surprised that his mind is so troubled, that he is used to it. Dan demands Socrates to teach him. Socrates begins his initiation, by showing Dan visions of his whole life; his purpose; the world and \\"re arranges\\" the young man's mind. Socrates tells Dan that he should eliminate attachments and live in the present, but warns him that it would be a painful journey. Dan becomes besotted with Socrates's other proteg√©, a mysterious girl named Joy, who keeps turning up, unpredictably. A few weeks later, Dan suffers an accident, where his right leg is badly fractured. Socrates arrives and accelerates Dan's healing process. Socrates takes Dan to a caf√©, owned by his former disciple, Joseph, who serves simple food. Socrates instructs Dan to take up celibacy, consume only light food and avoid intoxicating substances. Dan is frustrated, and even fails once, but resumes. Next, Socrates begins to train Dan physically, making him run, correcting his poise and breath, practice tai chi, meditation and aikido and refine his gymnastics. Dan graduates and Socrates decides to part ways with him, as Dan must travel his path on his own. Dan marries Linda, but the marriage fails. He travels around the world for six years, learning new physical teachings, but is unable to find peace. Dejected, Dan returns to Berkeley, to an old place which Socrates had told him about long ago. Dan meets Socrates again, now over hundred years old. Socrates tells Dan that he is almost near to his goal. Mystified, Dan follows Socrates to an ancient Native American burial ground. A thunderstorms breaks out and the two go inside a cave. Dan experiences a vision where he dies but still remains conscious. He finally overcomes his fear of death. Socrates reminds Dan of his teachings and that he must be happy without any reason. Socrates and Dan return home. Dan wonders where Socrates is and opens the door. Socrates has disappeared, died presumably. Dan returns home as a wiser man. He falls in love and marries Joyce, who is revealed to be Joy.

His work Ein Baum stirbt - Un albero muore, 1974, is by of Lugano.Museo Cantonale d'Arte, Lugano: Jean-Michel Folon He also designed numerous posters, often for humanitarian causes. Around 1988 he created his first sculptures made out of wood. He then moved on to creating sculptures in clay, plaster, bronze and marble, while continuing to paint. Several museums dedicated exhibitions to him, among them the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris in 1971, the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam in 1976, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1977, the Mus√©e Picasso in Antibes in 1984, the Museo Correr in Venice in 1986, the Museo de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires in 1987, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1990, La Pedrera in Barcelona in 1993, the Bunkamura in Tokyo in 1995, the Olympic Museum in Lausanne in 1996 and the in Bologna in 1996‚Äì97. In 1999 an exhibition of large sculptures was presented in the Galerie Guy Pieters, in Saint-Paul de Vence. In 2000 he opened the Fondation Folon, which presents the essentials of his work in the region he grew up in. In 2001 the city of Lisbon held a large retrospective of his sculptures in the Castelo de S√£o Jorge, which dominates the city. In 2003 he created the designs for Puccini's La Boh√®me for the Puccini Festival in Italy. The president of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, awarded him the Legion of Honour in the Palais d'Elys√©e. In 2004 he became a UNICEF ambassador. In 2005 the city of Florence held a grand retrospective of his work at the Palazzo Vecchio and the Forte di Belvedere. Folon published his drawings in newspapers, mostly in the US, where he was recognized earlier than in Europe and illustrated books by Franz Kafka, Ray Bradbury, Jorge Luis Borges, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jacques Pr√©vert, Boris Vian, Guy de Maupassant, Albert Camus, Herbert George Wells and Jean de La Fontaine. He never really changed his style, whose most famous emblem is the \\"bird-man\\" but used all kinds of supports; Folon made murals (Magic City for the Brussels subway, 1974; Waterloo Station for the London tube, 1975), posters for theater and opera (Spoleto Festival, 1978; Teatro Olimpicio, 1987) and cinema (The Purple Rose of Cairo, by Woody Allen, 1985), theater and opera scenery (Geneva and Brussels, 1981; Venice and Roma, 1989), short films for TV (opening and closing sections for the French channel Antenne 2, 1975‚Äì1984), wooden sculptures, logotypes (Bicentenary of the French Revolution, 1989; Philexfrance, 1989), tapestries (Congress Hall of Monaco, 1989), ships (1990), church windows (1992), sculptures (La mer, ce grand sculpteur, Knokke, 1997), and even a Palio flag (Siena, 1999).

He credits Giorgio Soavi for publishing his first posters, which were designed for Olivetti in Milan: \\"As he has done for many artists, Soavi suggested to me, too, that I invent things that were out of the ordinary for me. This attitude has created such a fertile spirit of invention around him that one wonders if he is not the true author of the works that he has thus encouraged.\\"Folon, Jean-Michel. \\"About the Posters,\\" in Posters by Folon.

Lettres a Giorgi [New York] Barron's / Alice Editions [1975] He created a famous piece of television that was screened in France for almost 30 years. It was first made for the Italiques TV show, by Marc Gilbert , which aired from 1971 to 1974. The music, originally the soundtrack of Gott mit uns, was composed by Ennio Morricone. In the 1990s, Folon decided to create a foundation in the Solvay Castle, La Hulpe. In 2005, under the direction of Marilena Pasquali, Fabio Mochi organised the exhibition of Jean-Michel Folon in Florence which six years later gave rise to the creation of the permanent Folon exhibition in the Giardino delle Rose (Rose Garden) in Florence. Another piece of television quite famous and remembered is a commercial about methane for SNAM. The soundtrack is Dolorosa by Michel Colombier. Personal life Folon settled in the outskirts of Paris in 1955. In 1985, he moved to Monaco. Milton Glasser describes an incident with Folon in the 1970s: \\"Last year a group of us were driving at dusk from Paris to Folon's house at Burcy. As we passed the forest of Fountainbleau, Jean-Michel mentioned that we were going to have rabbit for dinner.

He played a central role in designing the public education system of Indiana. Caleb Mills arrived in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in November 1833 with his bride Sarah, after graduating from Dartmouth College in 1828 and Andover Theological Seminary in 1833,Kritz, H.S. \\"The Death if Caleb Mills\\", Indiana Magazine of History (vol. 35, no. 3, 1939), p. 298.

As soon as a charter could be obtained from the state legislature it became the Wabash Teachers Seminary and Manual Labor College, finally acquiring the name Wabash College in 1851 (Osborne 1932, p. 31). Mills, fresh out of divinity school, was recruited to the job by his old college roommate Edmund Otis Hovey, one of the nine founders of the school, who later joined him on the faculty as one of the professors. In the early days it was Mills' task as the sole teacher to teach all the classes in every subject, and additionally to serve as the pastor of a church six miles outside of town on weekends.Swift, Beth. \\"Caleb Mills‚ÄîActivist\\". Retrieved March 17, 2018. Starting in 1846, for six years, Mills wrote an annual address to the Indiana legislature on the subject of public education. In these letters, arguing for a statewide system of taxpayer funded free public schools, he made the case that the benefits of a \\"good and efficient system of free schools\\" would pay for themselves, and described the parts that would be needed for such a system, including township school committees, district superintendents, school libraries, and normal schools to train teachers. These addresses were printed in the Indiana State Journal under the byline \\"One of the People\\", and were the main influence on the new school law, embracing most of Mills' proposals, which was drafted and adopted by the state constitutional convention in 1852.Moore, Charles W. Caleb Mills and the Indiana School System (Indianapolis, 1905). In 1854 Caleb Mills was elected Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction, defeating the incumbent Democrat, William C. Larrabee, 99,857 to 85,835.Stoll, John B. History of the Indiana Democracy 1816-1916 (Indianapolis, 1917), p. 165. Mills, a Whig, ran on a fusion ticket called the People's Party which brought together Whigs, Free Soilers, Know-Nothings and temperance advocates to support a common slate. Mills, after serving one term, did not stand for re-election in 1856 and Larrabee regained the office. Mills remained on the faculty of Wabash College, teaching Greek and serving as curator of the college library, until his death in 1879 (Osborne 1932, p. 144). Indiana State University has recognized Mills' immeasurable contributions to education in Indiana by naming one of their residence halls for Mills.

Bringing together the leaderships of the Ulster Defence Association, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando, the CLMC sought to ensure that the groups would work towards the same goals. The group was made up of a number of 'Liaison Officers' who were senior figures from the paramilitary groups themselves, as well as from the Ulster Democratic Party and the loyalist Progressive Unionist Party. The UDP was made up of representatives from UDA and the PUP was made up of representatives from both the RHC and UVF. 1991 Ceasefire The CLMC first tested the idea of a ceasefire in 1991 when it called a halt to all action from 29 April to 4 July of that year. The only breach of the 10-week ceasefire was the killing by the Ulster Freedom Fighters of Eddie Fullerton, a Sinn F√©in Councillor in Buncrana, County Donegal.McKittrick, David (2004) Lost Lives p. 1236 The UDA justified the killing, insisting that the ceasefire only applied within Northern Ireland.McDonald, Henry (2004) UDA ‚Äì Inside the heart of loyalist terror p. 190 In the same period the IRA would murder 13 people.Loyalists by Peter Taylor page 216 The ceasefire indicated that the CLMC was open to the possibility of ending its campaign and a line of negotiation was opened afterwards with Robin Eames, the head of the Church of Ireland. Paramilitary action The only paramilitary action claimed in the name of the CLMC was a rocket attack on Crumlin Road Prison on 13 December 1991, in retaliation for an IRA bomb in the prison on 24 November 1991 which killed two loyalist prisoners. An RPG-7 was fired at the canteen block where republican prisoners were having their evening meal but the rocket bounced off a window grille and failed to explodeWood, Ian (2006) Crimes of Loyalty ‚Äì A history of the UDA, p. 150 1994 Ceasefire After a long process of consultation with members and activists across Northern Ireland, the CLMC called a ceasefire on 13 October 1994, bringing loyalists fully into the peace process. The ceasefire was announced at a press conference at Fernhill House in the Glencairn area of the Shankill.Garland, Roy (2001) Gusty Spence p. 290 Former UVF commander and PUP politician Gusty Spence read out the ceasefire statement which included an apology for the innocent victims of loyalist violence.Cusack, Jim & McDonald, Henry (2008) UVF The endgame p. 319 \\"In all sincerity, we offer to the loved ones of all innocent victims over the past twenty-five years, abject and true remorse. No words of ours will compensate for the intolerable suffering they have undergone during the conflict.\\" Drumcree The ceasefire, however, proved difficult to maintain and in 1996 the CLMC was forced to distance itself from the murder of Catholic taxi driver, Michael McGoldrick by the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade. They were further embarrassed by television pictures that year showing loyalists at Drumcree Church being led against the security forces by Billy Wright, at the time the leader of the Mid-Ulster UVF. Following the unsanctioned killing of a Catholic taxi driver by his brigade, Wright, along with the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster UVF, was stood down by the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership). Wright was soon expelled from the UVF for his renegade actions along with a number of his followers who soon reconstituted as the Loyalist Volunteer Force, continuing without ceasefire. Despite no longer having full control of Loyalism, the CLMC carried on and supported the signing of the Belfast Agreement. However, since then the CLMC has effectively ceased to exist as the UVF and UDA were embroiled in a loyalist feud over Johnny Adair and commitment to the Agreement has wavered. Overall control of Loyalism has largely been lost to the CLMC and, whilst it is still theoretically maintained, it is no longer the important body that it once was. The subsequent Loyalist Commission (LC) represented the political work of the new McMichael-ite UDA politicos, known as the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG), which followed the now defunct UDP, and the David Ervine-inspired PUP. Led by the UPRGs liberal but tough East Belfast faction, Frankie Gallagher, and Dawn Purvis the new PUP leader, the testing post-Ervine vacuum murders by the CIRA-RIRA alliance were rendered ineffective when even the now larger hard-line Loyalist Volunteer Force refused to retaliate to several murders in March 2009. Many duly credit the CLMC/LC bodies with the final say in the Northern Irish peace process, in that their groupings managed somehow to not only avoid retaliation to the March 2009 killings, but (some argue) that they brought, albeit unofficially, the un-aligned LVF more into the peace process. At the Belfast peace rally of 12 March 2009 a community-led body calling itself the Combined Loyalists for Peace appeared. Quoted in the Irish Independent they stressed that the loyalist communities had a peace strategy and would stick to it. UDA leader Jackie McDonald confirmed the group's thoughts on a BBC interview when he said loyalists would not be goaded into reaction adding that \\"clowns\\" would not spoil the loyalist peace strategy. In a carefully choreographed move Frankie Gallahgher met Belfast mayor, Tom Hartley of Sinn F√©in in public that same day. Despite goading from rebel republicans, three levels of formerly hard-line loyalism were evident for the first time and in public ‚Äì the community, the military, and the political. All were showing overt support for no return to violence. Subsequently, and merely weeks after the dissident republican murders, the groups which had made up the CLMC made separate announcements to the media that arms had been decommissioned. Dawn Purvis, now leader of the PUP mentioned above, quoting the input of influential liberal loyalists such as Billy Mitchell and Billy McCaughey, announced on behalf of the UVF and the RHC that all weapons had been put beyond use. Frankie Gallagher, speaking for the UDA/UFF via the UPRG, stated that their process was underway. This was confirmed by General de Chastelain hours later. The CLMC set out to see that any conflict resolution initiatives by Irish republicans in the peace process were matched by loyalist groups, and nearly 20 years after its creation, and despite the fact that 'in essence' it no longer existed, it finally and successfully achieved its goals.

The nuclear development operations of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee consumed huge quantities of Tennessee Valley Authority electrical power that would have otherwise been available to other industrial operations. The Chicago Corporation was able to acquire a Federal Power Commission (FPC) license to build a pipeline from Texas to Appalachia, eventually expanding to the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States. These pipelines were acquired by El Paso Corporation in 1996, and are now owned by Kinder Morgan. A Tenneco filling station in Tallahassee, Florida in 1967. =Diversification= In the 1950s, the company acquired existing oil companies, including Sterling Oil, Del-Key Petroleum, and Bay Petroleum.Tenneco Inc. The Tennessee division of the Chicago Corporation acquired Tennessee Gas Transmission Company in 1943 to build a natural-gas pipeline from Texas to West Virginia. The first line was completed in October 1944. It was followed by three additional pipelines totaling during the next 15 years which provide gas to New York and New Jersey.Directory of Company Histories, 1988, Encyclopedia.com (retrieved 11 September 2010) In 1966, Tennessee Gas was incorporated as Tenneco, Inc. Tenneco expanded into a number of business ventures as a result of diversification. In 1967, the company acquired Walker, Inc., a manufacturer of universal-fit exhaust mufflers and pipes. The year after, they started working on the construction of a universal-fit catalytic converter, that would become a cost-effective alternative to the OE catalytic converters. It took the company 8 years to introduce one. Tenneco bought Houston Oil & Minerals Corporation in the late 1970s. Tenneco owned and operated a large number of gasoline service stations, but all were closed or replaced with other brands by the mid-1990s. Fairchild F-27J executive aircraft of Tenneco at Chicago O'Hare Airport in 1979 In the 1970s, Tenneco purchased 53% of J.I. Case when they purchased its owner Kern County Land Company, the agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Tenneco-Inc- Company-History.html In 1972, Tenneco purchased UK-based David Brown Tractors Ltd. and merged it with the J.I. Case business. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J.I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. Tenneco purchased the articulated 4WD manufacturer Steiger Tractor in 1986, and merged it into Case IH. The corporate direction was to buy failing companies, and work to develop them into market leaders. This worked well with Newport News Shipbuilding, but failed miserably with the various tractor companies, probably due in large part to the economy at the time. By 1988, the company was losing $2 million per day. After being pressured by the banks, it was decided to sell off the oil business. Tenneco Oil Exploration Company was split up and sold off to multiple buyers. By 1994, Tenneco decided to begin getting out of the ag business and agreed to sell 35% of the now named Case Corporation. In 1996, the spin-off of Case Corporation was completed. The company was acquired by Fiat in 1999 and merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/CNH-Global-NV-company- History.html =Consolidation= Tenneco Inc. emerged from a conglomerate consisting of six unrelated businesses: shipbuilding, packaging, farm and construction equipment, gas transmission, automotive, and chemicals.Tenneco History , Tenneco.com (retrieved 12 September 2010) The automotive division was spun off from Tenneco, Inc. in 1991 along with the packaging, energy, natural gas, and shipbuilding divisions. All businesses except automotive and packaging were disposed of between 1994 and 1996 (through public offerings, sales, spin-offs and mergers). In 1999, Tenneco Packaging was spun off and renamed to Packaging Corporation of America (Pactiv Corporation). Since the 1960s Tenneco Automotive has sold mufflers (UK: silencers) in Europe, including through the Pit Stop chain in Germany. The group bought a German factory in Virnheim in 1969, Swedish Starla in 1974 and French Bellanger and English Harmo Industries in 1976 and Danish Lydex in 1978. More acquisitions followed.

The music was written by Harold Arlen and the lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The song was nominated for the \\"Academy Award for Best Original Song\\" at the 18th Academy Awards in 1945 after being used in the film Here Come the Waves. Background It is sung in the style of a sermon, and explains that accentuating the positive is key to happiness. In describing his inspiration for the lyric, Mercer told the Pop Chronicles radio documentary \\"[my] publicity agent ... went to hear Father Divine and he had a sermon and his subject was 'you got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.' And I said 'Wow, that's a colorful phrase!'\\" Chart performance Mercer recorded the song, with The Pied Pipers and Paul Weston's orchestra, on October 4, 1944, and it was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 180. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on January 4, 1945, and lasted 13 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 2. On the Harlem Hit Parade chart, it went to number four. The song was number five on Billboard's Annual High School Survey in 1945. On March 25, 2015, it was announced that Mercer's version would be inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry for the song's \\"cultural, artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation‚Äôs audio legacy\\". Other recordings Within a matter of weeks, several other recordings of the song were released by other well-known artists: *Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters made a recording on December 8, 1944, with Vic Schoen and his Orchestra, which was released by Decca Records as catalog number 23379. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on January 25, 1945, and lasted nine weeks on the chart, peaking at number 2. * Kay Kyser made a recording on December 21, 1944, with Dolly Mitchell and a vocal trio. This was released by Columbia as catalog number 36771. * Dinah Washington recorded the song with Lionel Hampton on live broadcast on March 8, 1945. * A recording by Artie Shaw was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-1612. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on January 25, 1945, and lasted five weeks on the chart, peaking at number 5. A few months later, another version was recorded by Johnny Green in the United Kingdom on April 6, 1945, and released by Parlophone Records as catalog number F-2069. Connie Francis added the song in 1960 to her \\"Swinging Medley\\" (sometimes also referred to as \\"Gospel Medley\\"), where she combined it with three other songs: \\"Yes, indeed\\", \\"Amen\\", and \\"Lonesome Road\\". Three versions of this medley were recorded on different occasions in 1960. The first recording was broadcast in a mock-live radio show of National Guard Radio early that year. The two other recordings were intended for release on Francis's label MGM Records but remained unreleased until 1996 on Bear Family Records. The song was included by Roy Hamilton on his 1960 album Come Out Swingin. Ella Fitzgerald included the song on her 1961 double album \\"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook\\" on Verve Records. The song has twice been recorded by Perry Como: once on February 19, 1958, and later in July, 1980. Both were primarily made for albums. Neither version was released as a single in the United States, though the 1958 version was released in Germany by RCA as a single (catalog number 47-9243-A). Aretha Franklin recorded it for the 1962 album The Electrifying Aretha Franklin for Columbia Records, and it features in her many re-releases on that label.

Because the mixture is a strong oxidizing agent, it will remove most organic matter, and it will also hydroxylate most surfaces (add OH groups), making them highly hydrophilic (water-compatible). This means the solution can easily dissolve fabric and skin causing severe chemical burns in the process. Preparation and use Many different mixture ratios are commonly used, and all are called piranha. A typical mixture is 3 parts of concentrated sulfuric acid and 1 part of 30% hydrogen peroxide solution; other protocols may use a 4:1 or even 7:1 mixture. A closely related mixture, sometimes called \\"base piranha\\", is a 3:1 mixture of ammonia water with hydrogen peroxide. Piranha solution must be prepared with great care. It is highly corrosive and an extremely powerful oxidizer. Surfaces must be reasonably clean and completely free of organic solvents from previous wash steps before coming into contact with the solution. Piranha solution cleans by dissolving organic contaminants, and a large amount of contaminant will cause violent bubbling and a release of gas that can cause an explosion. Piranha solution should always be prepared by adding hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric acid slowly, never in reverse. Mixing the solution is extremely exothermic. If the solution is made rapidly, it will instantly boil, releasing large amounts of corrosive fumes. Even when made with care, the resultant heat can bring solution temperatures above 100 ¬∞C. It must be allowed to cool reasonably before it is used. The sudden increase in temperature can also lead to violent boiling of the extremely acidic solution. Solutions made using hydrogen peroxide at concentrations greater than 50% may cause an explosion. Once the mixture has stabilized, it can be further heated to sustain its reactivity. The hot (often bubbling) solution cleans organic compounds off substrates and oxidizes or hydroxylates most metal surfaces. Cleaning usually requires about 10 to 40 minutes, after which the substrates can be removed from the solution. The solution may be mixed before application or directly applied to the material, applying the sulfuric acid first, followed by the peroxide. Due to the self-decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, piranha solution should be used freshly prepared. The solution should not be stored, as it generates gas and therefore cannot be kept in a closed container. As the solution reacts violently with many items commonly disposed of as chemical waste if the solution has not neutralised, it must be left in clearly marked containers. Applications Piranha solution is used frequently in the microelectronics industry, e.g. to clean photoresist residue from silicon wafers. Even though there are safer and cheaper options, the solution can be used to etch home made circuit boards. A mask is applied to a blank copper board, and the piranha solution rapidly removes the exposed copper not covered by the mask. In the laboratory, this solution is sometimes used to clean glassware, though it is discouraged in many institutions and it should not be used routinely due to its dangers. Unlike chromic acid solutions, piranha does not contaminate glassware with heavy-metal ions. Piranha solution is particularly useful when cleaning sintered (or \\"fritted\\") glassware. The size of the pores of sintered glassware is critical for its function, so it should not be cleaned with strong bases, which gradually dissolve the sinter. Sintered glass also tends to capture material deep within the structure, making it difficult to remove. Where less aggressive cleaning methods fail, piranha solution can be used to return the sinter to a pristine white, free-flowing form without excessive damage to the pore dimensions. This is usually accomplished by allowing the solution to percolate backward through the sintered glass. Although cleaning sintered glassware will leave it as clean as possible without damaging the glassware it is not recommend due to the risk of explosion. Piranha solution is used to make glass hydrophilic by hydroxylating the surface, thus increasing the number of silanol groups on the surface. Mechanism The effectiveness of piranha solution in removing organic residues is due to two distinct processes that operate at noticeably different rates. The first and faster process is removal of hydrogen and oxygen as units of water by the concentrated sulfuric acid. This occurs because hydration of concentrated sulfuric acid is thermodynamically strongly favorable, with a ŒîH of ‚àí880 kJ/mol. It is this rapid dehydrating property, rather than acidity itself, that makes concentrated sulfuric acid, and so piranha solution, very dangerous to handle. :H2SO4 \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí H2SO5 (Caro's acid) + H2O The dehydration process exhibits itself as the rapid carbonisation of common organic materials, especially carbohydrates, when immersed in piranha solution. Piranha solution was named in part for the vigour of this first process, since large quantities of organic residues immersed in the solution are dehydrated so violently that the process resembles a piranha feeding frenzy. The second and more definitive rationale for the name, however, is the ability of piranha solution to \\"eat anything\\", in particular, elemental carbon in the form of soot or char. This second and far more interesting process can be understood as the sulfuric-acid boosted conversion of hydrogen peroxide from a relatively mild oxidizing agent into one sufficiently aggressive to dissolve elemental carbon, a material that is notoriously resistant to room-temperature aqueous reactions. This transformation can be viewed as the energetically favourable dehydration of hydrogen peroxide to form hydronium ions, bisulfate ions, and, transiently, atomic oxygen: :H2SO4 \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí H3O+ \\\\+ HSO4‚àí \\\\+ O It is this extremely reactive atomic oxygen species that allows piranha solution to dissolve elemental carbon. Carbon allotropes are difficult to attack chemically because of the highly stable and typically graphite-like hybridized bonds that surface carbon atoms tend to form with each other. The most likely route by which the solution disrupts these stable carbon‚Äìcarbon surface bonds is for an atomic oxygen first to attach directly to a surface carbon to form a carbonyl group: :File:piranha1.svg In the above process, the oxygen atom in effect \\"steals\\" an electron bonding pair from the central carbon, forming the carbonyl group and simultaneously disrupting the bonds of the target carbon atom with one or more of its neighbours. The result is a cascading effect in which a single atomic oxygen reaction initiates significant \\"unraveling\\" of the local bonding structure, which in turn allows a wide range of aqueous reactions to affect previously impervious carbon atoms. Further oxidation, for example, can convert the initial carbonyl group into carbon dioxide and create a new carbonyl group on the neighbouring carbon whose bonds were disrupted: :File:piranha2.svg The carbon removed by piranha solution may be either original residues or char from the dehydration step. The oxidation process is slower than the dehydration process, taking place over a period of minutes. The oxidation of carbon exhibits itself as a gradual clearing of suspended soot and carbon char left by the initial dehydration process. In time, piranha solutions in which organic materials have been immersed typically will return to complete clarity, with no visible traces of the original organic materials remaining. A final minor contribution to the piranha solution cleaning is its high acidity, which dissolves deposits such as metal oxides and carbonates. However, since it is safer and easier to remove such deposits using milder acids, the solution is more typically used in situations where high acidity facilitates cleaning instead of complicating it. For substrates with low tolerance for acidity, an alkaline solution consisting of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide, known as base piranha, is preferred. Safety and disposal Piranha solution is very dangerous, being both strongly acidic and a strong oxidizer. Solution that is no longer being used should never be left unattended if hot. It should not be stored in a closed container. Piranha solution should not be disposed of with organic solvents (e.g. in waste solvent carboys), as this will cause a violent reaction and a substantial explosion. The solution should be allowed to cool, and oxygen gas should be allowed to dissipate prior to disposal. When cleaning glassware, it is both prudent and practical to allow the piranha solution to react overnight. This allows the spent solution to degrade prior to disposal. While some institutions believe that used piranha solution should be collected as hazardous waste, others believe that it can be neutralized and poured down the drain with copious amounts of water. Attempting neutralization by adding bases can instead cause fast decomposition, which releases pure oxygen.

Education and career Coat of Arms of David Brearley Born on June 11, 1741, in Trenton, Province of New Jersey, British America, Brearley attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and read law. He was in private practice in Allentown,Dictionary of American Biography Vol. 2 p. 1 Province of New Jersey, British America (State of New Jersey, United States from July 4, 1776) until 1776. He served in the Continental Army from 1776 to 1779, during the American Revolutionary War. He was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey from 1779 to 1789. He was a delegate from New Jersey to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which drafted the United States Constitution and was a signer of the Constitution. He was a presidential elector in 1789. =Opposition to British colonial rule and military service= Prior to the start of the American Revolution, Brearley was on one occasion arrested for his opposition to the rule of the British Parliament but was freed by a mob. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Brearley was at first a captain in the Monmouth County militia after having spent many years speaking out against the Parliamentary absolutism. He eventually rose to the rank of colonel in Nathaniel Heard's New Jersey militia brigade. From 1776 to 1779 he served in the New Jersey Line of the Continental Army, seeing action at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. =Notable case as Chief Justice= Brearley decided on the famous Holmes v. Walton case where he ruled that the judiciary had the authority to declare whether laws were unconstitutional or not. =Participating in the Constitutional Convention= While at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Brearley was Chairman of the Committee on Postponed Parts, which played a substantial role in shaping the final document.Stewart, David. \\"The Summer of 1787\\". p. 207 The committee addressed questions related to the taxes, war- making, patents and copyrights, relations with Native American tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the house. The biggest issue they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input.Stewart, David. \\"The Summer of 1787\\". p. 209 They adopted the earlier plan for choosing the president by the electoral college and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be \\"nineteen times out of twenty\\". The committee also shorted the president's term from seven years to four years, freed him to seek reelection, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created the vice president, whose only role was to succeed the president and preside over the senate. This also transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, who was given the power (which had been given to the senate by Rutledge's committee) to make treaties and appoint ambassadors.Stewart, David. \\"The Summer of 1787\\". p. 212 He ultimately signed the finished Constitution.

Life  He was born of humble parentage at Tielt in Flanders. His original surname was \\"de Neckere\\", that in Flemish mean \\"evil spirit\\", giving him the nickname of \\"Olivier le Mauvais\\" (\\"Olivier the Wicked\\"). Seeking his fortune at Paris, he became court barber and valet to Louis XI, and so ingratiated himself with the king that in 1474 he was ennobled under the title Le Daim and in 1477 made comte de Meulan. In the latter year he was sent to Burgundy to influence Mary of Burgundy, the young heiress of Charles the Bold, but he was ridiculed and compelled to leave Ghent. He thereupon seized and held Tournai for the French. Le Daim had considerable talent for intrigue, and, according to his enemies, could always be depended upon to execute the baser designs of the king. He amassed a large fortune, largely by oppression and violence, and was named gentleman-in- waiting, captain of Loches, and governor of Saint-Quentin. He remained in favour until the death of Louis XI, when the rebellious lords were able to avenge the slights and insults they had suffered in the hands of the royal barber. He was arrested on charges, the nature of which is uncertain, tried before the parlement of Paris, and on May 21, 1484, hanged at the Gallows of Montfaucon without the knowledge of Charles VIII, who might have heeded his father's request and spared the favourite. Le Daim's property was given to the Duke of Orl√©ans. Memoirs of his contemporaries include: *Philippe de Commines (ed.

Examples appear in many branches of mathematics, especially in homological algebra and representation theory. A filtered algebra over the field k is an algebra (A,\\\\cdot) over k that has an increasing sequence \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq F_0 \\\\subseteq F_1 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots \\\\subseteq F_i \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots \\\\subseteq A of subspaces of A such that :A=\\\\bigcup_{i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} F_{i} and that is compatible with the multiplication in the following sense: : \\\\forall m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N},\\\\qquad F_m\\\\cdot F_n\\\\subseteq F_{n+m}. Associated graded algebra In general there is the following construction that produces a graded algebra out of a filtered algebra. If A is a filtered algebra then the associated graded algebra \\\\mathcal{G}(A) is defined as follows: G_n\\\\,, where, : G_0=F_0, and : \\\\forall n>0, \\\\quad G_n=F_n/F_{n-1}\\\\,, 2= the multiplication is defined by : (x+F_{n-1})(y+F_{m-1})=x\\\\cdot y+F_{n+m-1} for all x\\\\in F_n and y\\\\in F_m. (More precisely, the multiplication map \\\\mathcal{G}(A)\\\\times \\\\mathcal{G}(A) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{G}(A) is combined from the maps : (F_n / F_{n-1}) \\\\times (F_m / F_{m-1}) \\\\to F_{n+m}/F_{n+m-1}, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\left(x+F_{n-1},y+F_{m-1}\\\\right) \\\\mapsto x\\\\cdot y+F_{n+m-1} for all n\\\\geq 0 and m\\\\geq 0.) }} The multiplication is well defined and endows \\\\mathcal{G}(A) with the structure of a graded algebra, with gradation \\\\\\\\{G_n\\\\\\\\}_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}}. Furthermore if A is associative then so is \\\\mathcal{G}(A). Also if A is unital, such that the unit lies in F_0, then \\\\mathcal{G}(A) will be unital as well. As algebras A and \\\\mathcal{G}(A) are distinct (with the exception of the trivial case that A is graded) but as vector spaces they are isomorphic. Examples Any graded algebra graded by ‚Ñï, for example A = \\\\bigoplus_{n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} A_n , has a filtration given by F_n = \\\\bigoplus_{i=0}^n A_i . An example of a filtered algebra is the Clifford algebra \\\\operatorname{Cliff}(V,q) of a vector space V endowed with a quadratic form q. The associated graded algebra is \\\\bigwedge V, the exterior algebra of V. The symmetric algebra on the dual of an affine space is a filtered algebra of polynomials; on a vector space, one instead obtains a graded algebra. The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} is also naturally filtered. The PBW theorem states that the associated graded algebra is simply \\\\mathrm{Sym} (\\\\mathfrak{g}). Scalar differential operators on a manifold M form a filtered algebra where the filtration is given by the degree of differential operators. The associated graded algebra is the commutative algebra of smooth functions on the cotangent bundle T^*M which are polynomial along the fibers of the projection \\\\pi\\\\colon T^*M\\\\rightarrow M.

It was founded in 1957 by Dr. Taha Osman Bileya together with a group of Beja intellectuals, as a political platform for the politically and economically marginalized Beja people. According to the \\"Black Book\\", an analysis of Sudanese regional political representation published underground in the late 1990s by Darfur Islamist followers of Hassan al-Turabi, Eastern Sudan has been conspicuous since its independence for its political and economic marginalization. This part of Sudan had fewer ministers and representatives than other parts of the country in the civil and military branches of the central government, as well as having among the lowest rates of education and access to health services in the country.John Young, The Eastern Front and the Struggle against Marginalization , HSBA Publications: Sudan Working Papers No. 3 (May 2007), p.17 At first the Beja Congress was frustrated in seeking political power: it was banned in 1960, along with all other political parties, by the military junta of General Ibrahim Abboud. Once the ban was lifted in 1964, the party was able to mobilize the educated sector of the eastern Sudan and, it successfully participated in the 1965 parliamentary elections, with several of its activists winning seats to the constituent assembly. Though it was banned once again during the years of the military government of Gaafar Nimeiry (1969‚Äì84), after the popular uprising of 1985 removed Nimeiry, the Beja Congress participated in the national elections of 1986. The Congress won only one seat in that election, losing to a resurgent Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which subsequently participated in the Sadig Al-Mahdi-led coalition government of 1986‚Äì89.Young, The Eastern Front, p. 22 With the military takeover of the current National Islamic Front government in 1989, the Beja Congress was once again banned. In 1993 the group joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) based in Asmara, which had been founded by the DUP and the Umma Party in 1989. In the 1995 the Beja Congress signed the Asmara Declaration. Aided by the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SPLA) and the Eritrean military, armed fighters of the Congress made a series of attacks along the Sudanese-Eritrean border, concentrating on strategic assets, such as the Khartoum-Port Sudan road, the oil pipeline, and the military installations defending them. Despite their successes, Young notes, these attacks \\"did not close the road for more than a few hours or stop the flow of oil for more than a few days.\\"Young, The Eastern Front, p. 23 Although the Beja Congress have a significant fighting presence, they achieved a number of modest military victories. With the help of the SPLA, twice captured Hamishkoreb, before finally holding it from October 2002 until April 2006 when the SPLA withdrew from the NDA. By itself the Beja Congress held territory around Tokar, one of their historic strongholds, and the town of Khor Telkok near Kassala, which the NDA had declared to be their \\"capital\\".Young, The Eastern Front, pp. 23f Politically the Beja Congress was far more effective, capitalizing on two different incidents in January 2005 where Sudanese security attacked and killed unarmed civilians. Shortly after these events the Beja Congress organized a national conference in which Musa Mohamed Ahmed, was elected chairman of the group. Further, the party has enjoyed some success in uniting its fractious and isolated people: internal clashes are reported to be down in numbers. The Congress has been particularly successful at mobilizing its young people: the student administrations at two of the three main universities in the east are controlled by the Beja Congress and the party is making inroads into even secondary and primary schools. Young observes, \\"Beja resentment and support for the BC is clear to anyone spending just a short time in the coffee shops of Port Sudan.\\"Young, The Eastern Front, p. 28 Despite this, both the Beja Congress and the Rashaida Free Lions felt marginalized within the NDA. These tensions came to a head after the Egyptian security services organized negotiations between the NCP and the NDA in Cairo in 2004. Both the Beja Congress and the Free Lions walked out of the negotiations, claiming that their interests were not being fairly represented. Two months later the NDA held its annual conference in Asmara amid considerable acrimony. When the DUP, the Sudanese Communist Party, and Legitimate Command components of the NDA entered the Sudan National Assembly shortly afterwards, the NDA was obviously moribund.Young, The Eastern Front, p. 30 When the withdrawal of the SPLA from the NDA in 2004 led to the collapse of that alliance, the Beja Congress joined with the Rashaida Free Lions and other smaller groups to form the Eastern Front rebel group. However, weak leadership, an inability to reach out to other ethnic groups in eastern Sudan, and dependence on Eritrean support led to the failure of the Eastern Front. The Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement of 14 October 2006 called for the absorption of the Eastern Front armed forces into the Sudanese military in exchange for political positions in the national government, the national assembly, and in three eastern states for the Eastern Front leadership. In making this Agreement, many members of the Eastern Front negotiating team in Asmara are reported to have not been enthusiastic at the final language, and only signed the document because they felt that they had few viable alternatives.Young, The Eastern Front, p. 41  References  External links *Globalsecurity.org information on the Beja Congress *Beja Congress official webpage (Arabic only) *The Plight of the Beja People in Eastern Sudan By Suliman Salih Dirar (sudaneseonline.com) *Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting Another Darfur?

According to his official biography presented on his web site, he was born in Athens on 12 April 1944 and attended various university schools without receiving any qualifications. His bio include work as teacher of English language, a photographer, a journalist, a translator and an author.  Science fiction- translation  Balanos has worked in the field of science fiction and fantasy for many years. Within the Greek novels publisher \\"Aurora\\", he translated a great amount of short and medium size novels. One of the most distinctive characteristics, due to which he justifiably became noted, of these his translations is his comments in prologues, where he gave clues about some elements of the unexplained and the paranormal. Balanos' translating activity had begun years before the \\"Aurora\\" period. As far back as the early and mid 1980s he had published on his own efforts (through his own \\"Selefais\\" publications) several collections of translated science fiction, heroic fantasy and fantasy literature. He was the first to translate into Greek a wide variety of works by renowned English-speaking science fiction and fantasy writers (for which translations was awarded the Karel Prize by the World Science Fiction Association -1984), such as Isaac Asimov, Alfred Bester, Algernon Blackwood, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip Jose Farmer, Harry Harrison, William H. Hodgson, Robert E. Howard, Henry Kuttner, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, Arthur Machen, Clifford Simak, Clark Ashton Smith, H. G. Wells, Colin Wilson, John Wyndham, Roger Zelazny, etc., the vast majority of whom were virtually unknown to the Greek public up to then.  Balanos's own works  George Balanos is positively a prominent figure in the paranormal research field in Greece. A one-time APRO‚Äôs local representative, apart from being a most celebrated translator into Greek of many famous English-speaking science-fiction and fantasy writers, he has also written many books of his own, which are the outcome of a lifelong research into the paranormal and occult. The titles of the books written by him follow below: * \\"Flying Saucers - Intruders?\\" (\\"Iptamenoi Discoi - Eisvoleis?\\", 1973) * ‚ÄúBeings from Outer Space‚Äù (‚ÄúOnta Apo To Diastima‚Äù, 1974) * ‚ÄúThe Worlds of Fire‚Äù (‚ÄúOi Kosmoi Tis Fotias‚Äù, 1976) * ‚ÄúThe Sands of Time‚Äù (‚ÄúOi Ammoi Tou Khronou‚Äù, 1977) * \\"In Search of Unknown Worlds (\\"Anazitontas Agnostous Kosmous\\", 1979) * ‚ÄúDreamlands of the Earth‚Äù (‚ÄúOi Oneirotopoi Tis Ghis‚Äù, science fiction short story collection 1979) * \\"The Enigma of Penteli\\" (\\"To Enigma tis Pentelis, 1982) * \\"Pathways of the Stars\\" (\\"Ta Monopatia ton Astron, 1989, science fiction novel) * ‚ÄúCosmic Biodynamics,‚Äù (‚ÄúKosmiki Bhiodhynamiki‚Äù, 1993) * \\"Other Oceans, Other Worlds\\" (\\"Alloi Okeanoi, Alloi Kosmoi, 1993) * \\"All the Colors of the Suns\\" (\\"Ola ta Krhomata ton Ilion, science fiction short story collection, 1994) * \\"Bright Thorns\\" (\\"Lambera Agathia\\", fantasy novel, 1995) * ‚ÄúEnigmas Against a Gray Background‚Äù (‚ÄúAinighmata Se Grizo Fonto‚Äù,1998) * ‚ÄúThe Roads of Knowledge‚Äù (‚ÄúOi Dhromoi Tis Ghnosis‚Äù, 1998), * ‚ÄúThe Shadow of Cthulhu‚Äù (‚ÄúI Skia Tou Kthoulou‚Äù, 1993‚Äì98) * ‚ÄúHecate‚Äôs Nights‚Äù (‚ÄúNyktes Tis Ekatis‚Äù, 1998, supernatural horror/magick novel) * ‚ÄúSomething Crawling Like A Shadow‚Äù (‚ÄúKati Pou Erpei San Skia‚Äù, 2000) * \\"Reflections on Dark Waters\\" (\\"Antanaklaseis se Vathia Nera\\") * \\"In the Forests of the Twilight\\" (\\"Sta Dasi tou Lykofotos\\") * ‚ÄúBeyond the Penteli Enigma‚Äù (‚ÄúPera Apo To Enigma Tis Pentelis‚Äù, 2004) Journalism Balanos has worked as a journalist for the field of paranormal for various editions, most known \\"Strange\\" and \\"Anexighito\\" (Unexplained) magazines (and back in the 1970s writing in \\"Enigmata tou Symbandos\\" [Enigmas of the Universe) and \\"UFO - Iptamenoi Diskoi\\" (UFOs - Flying Saucers] magazines). He contributed articles on various fields of research of paranormal concerning cities, geometries, symbols, initiations, biographies of secret-famous magicians. Characteristics of his articles is the use of humour, often black, hidden personal vanity (indirectly presenting himself as a keeper of secret knowledge), and extensive scientific knowledge of various scientific fields. Research fields The research fields of Balanos are mostly noted in his books and are Magick techniques, psychology, history, paranormal phenomena. According to his books, his actions often attracted the interest of various governmental and non-governmental organisations (Translated title from Greek) Something that crawls like a shadow, . There is an element of truth concerning that since earlier attempts to understand the alleged phenomena at the cave Ntaveli of Penteli mountain in the area of Attica, found some resistance from the Greek authorities, and this led to some actions of prohibiting the entry to the cave. The result of the research of the cave lead to a book (Translated title from Greek) The Enigma of Penteli, 1982 (ISBN unknown). Cosmic biodynamics The outcome of Balanos‚Äô research over the years was the cosmic biodynamics system, an original synthesis comprising many notions from a wide variety of fields, such as anthropology, philosophy, physics, mathematics, biology, and chemistry, the basic premises of which consist in the following: the surrounding universe is, in fact, a vastly intricate, multidimensional whole, wherein the phenomenon of existence is conceived as something radically different and wider than most of the various philosophical, religious, mystical, political, etc., systems assume it to be. Everything in this multidimensional cosmos stems from the Cosmic Network. The Cosmic Network is the ‚Äòblueprint‚Äô, so to speak, of both the macrocosm and the microcosm. Every being that exists anywhere in the wide universe is an integral part of this network. We can get ourselves attuned to this cosmic network by bringing to surface and enhancing our latent unconscious potentialities, the so-called ‚Äúother senses‚Äù. Balanos uses the phrase ‚Äúto see the world through Other Eyes‚Äù (‚ÄúAlla Matia‚Äù) when referring to this last process. The Crawling Shadow Balanos in one of his books has named a new type of danger, that is a multidimensional force called Shadow. Attributed to the Shadow are paranormal memory loss, violence, phenomena of massive hysteria, and events of extraordinary evil. Opinions Readers of his books suggest that elements of his stories, theories, and research have been drawn by other writers, and they give as an example that his current definition of the word Pattern (who has copyrighted the translated Greek equivalent), has the same meaning with the word occurring to the science fiction Amber Series by Roger Zelazny. It is true that Balanos may have borrowed various notions from a wide field of disciplines, such as anthropology, philosophy, occultism, quantum physics, higher mathematics, biology, etc., but he synthesized all of these elements into a new and original system. So far as the term Pattern and Balanos' copyrighted translation into Greek (i.e., \\"Morphodiataxis\\") are concerned, this has nothing to do with whatever science fiction writer R. Zelazny means by it. Morphodiataxis is a core term in Balanos' Cosmic Biodynamics system, and it denotes the real whole of any given situation or phenomenon, taking into consideration all those data that elude our common, untrained senses.

Later versions of the software also functioned as a server browser for games that natively supported TCP/IP. Versions were also created for OS2 and Mac, but neither version was well polished. Today, Kali's network is still operational but development has largely ceased. Kali also features an Internet Game Browser for TCP/IP native games, a buddy system, a chat system, and supports 400+ games including Doom 3, many of the Command & Conquer games, the Mechwarrior 2 series, Unreal Tournament 2004, Battlefield Vietnam, Counter- Strike: Condition Zero, and Master of Orion II. The Kali software is free to download, but has a time-based cap for unregistered versions. For a one-time $20 fee the time restriction is removed. History The original MS-DOS version of Kali was created by Scott Coleman, Alex Markovich and Jay Cotton in the spring of 1995. It was the successor to a program called iDOOM (later Frag) that Cotton wrote so he could play id Software's DOS game DOOM over the Internet. After the release of Descent, Coleman, Markovich and Cotton wrote a new program to allow Descent, or any other game which supported LAN play using the IPX protocol, to be played over the Internet; this new program was named Kali. In the summer of 1995, Coleman went off to work for Interplay Productions, Markovich left the project and Cotton formed a new company, Kali Inc., to develop and market Kali. Cotton and his team developed the first Windows version (Kali95) and all subsequent versions. Initially Kali appealed only to hardcore computer tinkerers, due to the difficulty of getting TCP/IP running on MS-DOS. Kali95 took advantage of the greater network support of Windows 95, allowing Kali to achieve mainstream popularity. In the mid-1990s, it was an extremely popular way to play Command & Conquer, Descent, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, Duke Nukem 3D, and other games over the Internet, with more than 50,000 users worldwide by the end of 1996. The fact that only a small one-time fee was charged for the service, rather than a monthly subscription, also contributed to its popularity. This was largely possible due to Kali's scaled-down services; it did not provide the contests and high- tech chat features offered by other leading online gaming services. Since it was the only way for Windows and DOS users to play Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness against people outside of a LAN or dial-up connection, Blizzard actually included a copy of the program on the CD, going so far as to also provide a customized executable (WAR2KALI.EXE) which optimized the game's network code to account for Internet latency and also allowed users to specify their own settings for packet transmission and handling. During the height of IPX emulation's popularity, a competing product called \\"Kahn\\" was being sold by the now-defunct developer Stargate Networks for $15Kahn ($5 cheaper than Kali at that time). However, Kali was already well-established by this point; existing users saw no reason to buy another piece of software, and new users were still attracted to Kali's larger user base, since the whole point of the software was to be able to play with other people. The minor cost savings proved largely ineffective against Kali, and Kahn never achieved much market share. The market for Kali eventually dried up as games began to host their own online services, such as battle.net, MSN Gaming Zone, and also through direct TCP/IP connections, made easier by Microsoft's DirectPlay package. As IPX itself was phased out, Kali's unique emulation technology fell by the wayside and the software shifted its emphasis to becoming a game browser, a market where strong competitors such as GameSpy were already established. In the early 2000s, Cotton decided to sell Kali to a company that would have the capital to expand the program. However, this move proved to be disastrous for Kali as the new company folded shortly after the purchase. A year later Cotton reacquired the rights to the Kali software and system. Since then he has resumed development and support of Kali. , the latest version of Kali is 2.613, which was released in February 2004. At present Kali works with over 400 games. Support has faded over the last years making usage of Kali harder and less effective. Kali has gained new life, because the IPX protocol has been removed in all version of Windows after XP. Occasional specials reduce the cost of Kali to $10. As of 2014, the software has for the most part died. However, there is still a small, loyal following (largely residing in the Descent Channel) that uses the software as a chat room. Games, such as Descent, are still played among this group of gamers. Reception Kali won Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Special Award for Online-Enabling Technology\\". The editors called it \\"perhaps the most significant milestone so far in the nascent online gaming industry.\\" It won Computer Games Strategy Pluss award for the best online service of 1996, beating Mpath and the T.E.N. service. Next Generation likewise named it number one on their \\"Top 10 Online Gaming Sites\\" in early 1997, citing the lack of subscription fees and the unsurpassed selection of games supported.

The book was first published in 1969 by Cambridge University Press. It first appeared in the Cambridge Economic History of Europe, Volume VI in 1965, but it was expanded for the 1969 edition. The book deals with innovations and inventions that brought about modernization and technological developments in Western Europe beginning in the 18th century. The book explores why Europe was the first to industrialize and argues that industrialization is just one part of a larger process of modernization during which a culture significantly changes its social order, institutional order, attitudes, values, and government in order to promote and accommodate further change. In addition, the book also discusses the economic boom that has occurred since the industrial revolution began and argues that only through continued industrialization can the world sustain itself economically in the coming years. The book is considered by many to be one of the most significant books on the economic history of industrialization in Western Europe. It is considered to be one of the preeminent works on the economic history of industrialization in Western Europe. It has been reprinted numerous times and was published in a second edition with new commentary by Landes in 2003. * 1969 books Books about the Industrial Revolution ","title":"The Unbound Prometheus"},{"id":"2954328","text":"Imad Rahman is a Pakistani American fiction writer whose first short story collection was published in 2004.

In 1978 he started working on Hulk Weekly for Marvel UK which had just been drastically revamped by Dez Skinn. During this time he drew various strips for Marvel UK, including Hulk and Nick Fury, plus helping new artists such as Alan Davis. During the early 1980s he created Madman for Dez Skinn's Warrior before becoming a regular inker for Alan Davis's work for DC Comics. Their most notable work at this time being a run drawing Batman for Detective Comics. Neary became closely associated with Davis, inking his work from titles such as Uncanny X-Men to Captain Britain. Their working partnership still lasts to the present. Neary became editor-in-chief of Marvel UK from c. 1990‚Äì1993,Marvel U.K. entry Who's Who in American Comics, 1928-1999.

This began with Death's Head II and was followed by titles such as Hell's Angel (changed to Dark Angel after a copyright battle with the Hells Angels), Warheads, Digitek and Motormouth (later Motormouth and Killpower). Sales of the comics were initially high but over-expansion soon brought an end to Marvel UK's US line, with Panini Comics buying the company's assets, including Doctor Who Magazine. Neary has since been concentrating on inking since then. He has inked Bryan Hitch's work on The Authority and is now regularly working with Hitch on The Ultimates for Marvel Comics.

It has been called the \\"largest act of environmental warfare in history\\".Muscolino, Micah S. (2014). The Ecology of War in China: Henan Province, the Yellow River, and Beyond, 1938‚Äì1950. Cambridge University Press.  Strategic decision and subsequent flood  Following the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army marched rapidly into the heart of Chinese territory. By June 1938, the Japanese had control of all of North China. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take over Zhengzhou, the junction of the arterial Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Japanese success here would have directly endangered the major city of Wuhan. To stop further Japanese advances into western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, determined to open up the dikes(levees) on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike of Zhaokou, but due to difficulties at that location, the dike of Huayuankou, on the Yellow River's south bank, was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 via tunneling, with waters flooding into Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of farmland, and shifted the course of the Yellow River hundreds of kilometers to the south. Thousands of villages were inundated, and several million villagers were forced from their homes and made refugees. An unknown number of Japanese soldiers were killed by the flood. An official Kuomintang-led postwar commission estimated that the total number of casualties may be as high as 800,000 killed by the flood. Controversy regarding the strategy The strategic value of the flood has been questioned. Japanese troops were out of its range, either to the north and east or to the south. Their advance on Zhengzhou was halted, but they took Wuhan in October by attacking from a different direction. The Japanese did not occupy much of Henan until late in the war, and their hold on Anhui and Jiangsu remained tenuous. Most of the flooded towns and transport lines had already been captured by the Japanese; after the flood, the Japanese could not consolidate their control over the area. In fact, large parts of it became guerrilla areas. Controversy regarding number of casualties The number of casualties in the flood remains disputed and estimates have been revised by the Chinese government and other researchers in the decades after the event. There is no way of accurately assessing the casualties: much of the population, including officials, had already fled, leaving no government control and no one to count the dead. In the shifting battles between bandits, Nationalists, Communists, and Japanese, counting casualties was not a high priority. The Nationalist government, after initially claiming that the breach was caused by Japanese bombing, used the heavy casualties to demonstrate the scale of sacrifice required of the Chinese people; it claimed that 12 million people had been affected by the flood, and in 1948 it estimated the number of deaths including hundreds of thousands of Japanese who perished during the flooding at 800,000. A 1994 PRC (People's Republic of China) official history of the war put the dead in the flood at 900,000 and the refugees at nearly 10 million. Scholars exploring the archives now give much lower figures: 400,000‚Äì500,000 dead, 3 million refugees, and 5 million people affected (another estimate puts the number of dead at 500,000, and the number of homeless at 500,000).  Aftermath  Besides the massive death toll, the flooded areas were affected for years to come. The flooded countryside was more or less abandoned and all the crops destroyed. Upon the recession of the waters, much of the ground was uncultivable as much of the soil was covered in silt. Many of the public structures and housing were also destroyed, leaving any survivors destitute. The irrigation channels were also ruined, further adding to the toll on the farmlands. The destruction also had a long-term psychological effect on the Chinese population. Unable to fully decide which group deserved more blame for the catastrophe, the Chinese Government or the invading Japanese, many survivors blamed both sides. However, because there were many Chinese civilians killed during the flood by the KMT, most of the civilians residing in that area began to cooperate with the Japanese. Believing that the civilians would help them, the Chinese Communists turned the flooded area into a recruiting ground, directing survivors' anger towards a common enemy to bring them into their ranks. By the 1940s the area had evolved into a major guerrilla base known as the Yuwansu Base Area. = Repairs = Attempts to seal the breach and return the river to its former course were made in 1946, by the KMT with assistance from UNRRA. Work began in March and were complete in June, but the dams were destroyed by large summer flows. Subsequent repairs succeeded and completed in March 1947. The repairs became a political issue between the KMT and CPC, as the KMT controlled areas around the breach, and the CPC controlled the areas around the original downstream course. The river's pre-1938 bed had become a productive swath of farmland populated by 400,000 people; there were disputes around relocating and compensating these people, and whether to complete downstream dikes to retain some of this land before sealing the breach.

Biography Morrison was involved in the British Movement (BM) and also the National Front (NF) during the 1970s (he published two newsletters, both called British News, during the period; the first supported the BM and the second, for a time, the NF), as well as briefly organising a militant group called the British National Party (unrelated to the current incarnation) in his Leeds base.S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 100 Soon, however, he became associated with John Tyndall and followed him into the New National Front (NNF) in 1979 and from there into the newly formed British National Party (BNP) in 1982. Morrison appeared in an ITV World in Action television documentary about the NF and the BNP in 1978.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj3OvWmLOrM After leaving the BNP Morrison joined the notoriously violent National Democratic Freedom Movement (a minor group which ended when its founder, David Myatt, was jailed) before setting up his own group, the National Action Party in the early 1980s with Kevin Randall.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 186 The NAP was a small group and Tony Malski (now disappeared from the political scene) claimed that Morrison was out of his depth and had sought to merge the NAP into his own party. Morrison was readmitted to the BNP in 1988 and became regional organizer for Yorkshire, revitalising the party right across the North of England, especially when he organised the now notorious Dewsbury open air mass rally which is credited by many observers with putting the BNP on the map.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 44 Morrison returned to the NF in the late 1990s, rebuilding the local party group in Yorkshire after years of decline. However, the NF leadership soon became distrustful of the power base Morrison was building up. In 2002, he formed the White Nationalist PartySykes, Alan, The Radical Right in Britain Palgrave (2002) p147 and became one of its leading members until yet another split occurred and he again broke away with his followers. This time Morrison formed the Spearhead Support Group (soon shortened to Spearhead Group) and again linked up with Tyndall to support his attempts to regain leadership of the BNP from Nick Griffin. When progress was not made, Morrison suggested to Tyndall that he give up on the BNP altogether and form his own party, but Tyndall was not ready. After enduring a torrid few months as leader of the Nationalist Alliance (NA), Morrison, along with John G. Wood, left the NA and reconstituted their followers as the British People's Party. Under the BPP banner Morrison ran in the 2006 local elections in the Bramley and Stanningley ward of Leeds, securing 135 votes (2.7%) to finish last in a field of six candidates. In 2007, he advocated support for the BNP though \\"he objected to the induction of non-whites\\" in that party.\\"Morrison backs BNP, but only as stopgap\\", All The Way, May 2007 He rejoined the NF and was editor of the NF News from 2009 to 2010. Morrison published his autobiography Memoirs of a Street Soldier in 2003. He also writes self-published poetry, much of his work dealing with nationalist themes and some of a more general nature, and has two blogs.Poetry Unlimited and Nationalist Sentinel References External links *Obituary of Eddy Morrison on the Heritage and Destiny website 1949 births Living people British National Party people English neo-Nazis English autobiographers Self-published authors Leaders of the National Front (UK) Politicians from Leeds ","title":"Eddy Morrison"},{"id":"2954361","text":"Brian McNamara (born November 21, 1960) is an American actor.

While the contrasting subject of absenteeism has historically received extensive attention in the management sciences, presenteeism has only recently been studied.Johns, G. (2010): Presenteeism in the Workplace: A review and research agenda. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 31, 519-542. In Singapore, the term may also refer to the practice where employees stay in the office even after their work is done to wait until their bosses leave.https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-residents-working-fewer- hours-2010-mom-report Certain occupations such as welfare and teaching are more prone to presenteeism. Doctors may attend work while sick due to feelings of being irreplaceable. Jobs with large workloads are associated with presenteeism. People whose self-esteem is based on performance, as well as workaholics, typically have high levels of presenteeism. Presenteeism may have many motives. An employee may come to work because they simply need the money and cannot afford to take time off due to illness. Additionally, one could go to work due to a love and devotion to the job. In this case, presenteeism could be considered an act of organizational citizenship and inspire admiration from colleagues. Other reasons include feeling that their career prospects may be damaged if they take time off, and an expectation of presence driven from management.  Construct validity  Scholars have provided various other descriptions of the concept. For instance, Simpson claimed that presenteeism is \\"the tendency to stay at work beyond the time needed for effective performance on the job.\\"Simpson, R. (1998). Presenteeism, power and organizational change: Long hours as a career barrier and the impact on the working lives of women managers. British Journal of Management, 9, S37‚ÄìS50. Aronsson, Gustafsson, and Dallner wrote that it means attending work even when one feels unhealthy.Aronsson, G., Gustafsson, K., & Dallner, M. (2000). Sick but yet at work. An empirical study of sickness presenteeism. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health', 54, 502‚Äì509. In a recent review of the literature, Johns highlighted the lack of agreement between the many definitions. The author claimed that many of the definitions lack utility and that the term is most often defined as going to work while ill. He further noted that definitions of presenteeism, which are centered on attending work while sick, have received more evidence of construct validity. In other words, when defined as coming to work while sick, presenteeism seems to relate more to logical outcome variables and correlates. Simply viewing presenteeism as a negative act that leads to productivity loss and decreased health may be restricting potential analysis of the construct. Relationship with absenteeism In some cases, scholars relate presenteeism to absenteeism, which is the tendency not to show up for scheduled work. Furthermore, Johns described the notion that some believe that factors that reduce absenteeism will increase presenteeism. He stated, however, that this is plausible but not always the case because he pointed out that Aronsson et al. found high rates of presenteeism in industries where absenteeism was also high. Additionally, research that examines absenteeism is at times used to draw conclusions about presenteeism. For example, Virtanen, Kivimaki, Elovainio, Vahtera, and Ferrie found that employees exhibited much higher rates of absenteeism once they became permanent workers.Virtanen, M., Kivimaki, M., Elovainio, J., Vahtera, J., & Ferrie, J. E. (2003). From insecure to secure employment: Changes in work, health, health related behaviors, and sickness absence. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 60, 948‚Äì953. The authors thought that this increase could have been due to decreases in the preexisting levels of presenteeism. However, they did not directly measure presenteeism. Commenting on such research behavior, Johns said in his review of the literature that researchers should not infer presenteeism from absenteeism data. Instead, the author noted that both constructs should be measured at the same time. Antecedents =Temporary and permanent employment= Temporary and permanent employment are often considered when examining the antecedents of presenteeism. More specifically, researchers have studied these positions with the thought that lack of job security will cause those who do not have permanent positions to come to work more often even if they are sick. This hypothesis, however, has not received complete support. Aronsson et al. discovered that permanent employees were more prone to presenteeism than those in more seasonal positions. In contrast, Aronsson and Gustafson found no effect of job type.Aronsson, G. & Gustafsson, K. (2005). Sickness presenteeism: Prevalence, attendance-pressure factors, and an outline of a model for research. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 47, 958‚Äì966. Furthermore, Heponiemi et al. found that fixed-term employees as opposed to permanent employees were less likely to report working while ill, and the work of Bockerman and Laukkanen supported this finding.Heponiemi, T., Elovainio, M., Pentti, J., Virtanen, M., Westerlund, H., Virtanen, P., Oksanen, T., Kivim√§ki, M., Vahtera, J. (2010). Association of contractual and subjective job insecurity with sickness presenteeism among public sector employees. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 52, 830-835. Bockerman, P. & Laukkanen, E. (2010). What makes you work while you are sick? Evidence from a survey of workers. European Journal of Public Health, 20, 43-46. Based on these inconclusive results, Johns noted that researchers had to reconsider the job insecurity hypothesis. =Occupations and work environments= Individuals working in certain occupations may be more prone to presenteeism. In a study in Sweden, Aronsson et al. found that those offering welfare and teaching services demonstrated higher rates of presenteeism. The authors pointed out that these employees often worked with those in more vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Outside of education and healthcare, most of the occupations had lower rates of presenteeism; however, the results did suggest that higher risks jobs, which had more physical workload and stress, saw increased levels of presenteeism. Certain work environments may stimulate presenteeism. To explore this topic, Dew, Keefe, and Small qualitatively examined a private hospital, a large public hospital, and a small factory.Dew, K., Keefe, V., & Small, K. (2005). ‚ÄòChoosing‚Äô to work when sick: Workplace presenteeism. Social Science & Medicine, 60, 2273‚Äì2282. In the private hospital, there was little pressure from management to exhibit presenteeism; however, a sense of family seemed to exist between the staff, and a strong loyalty to coworkers pushed employees to come to work while unhealthy. The public hospital had a distant management, but presenteeism was fostered by \\"loyalty to professional image, colleagues, and the institution as a whole.\\" Finally, in the factory, there was strong pressure from management for employees to exhibit presenteeism. Furthermore, workers often had few other employment options, which often resulted in increased presenteeism. =Ease of replacement= The ease with which one can be replaced on the job also affects levels of presenteeism. Specifically, if one feels that he or she cannot be replaced, that individual is more prone to attend work while sick. Doctors are often examined in this regard. For example, Jena et al. studied residents in training and noted high rates of presenteeism, which they concluded were the result of feeling irreplaceable.Jena, A., Baldwin, D., Daugherty, S., Meltzer, D., & Arora, V. (2010). Presenteeism among resident physicians. Journal of the American Medical Association, 304, 1166-1168. Further extending the examination of the medical field, McKevitt, Morgan, Dundas, and Holland studied hundreds of healthcare professionals and found that more than 80 percent of respondents had worked while ill. Individuals listed some of the reasons they had not taken sick days, and many cited the fact that they felt large pressure to work.McKevitt, C., Morgan, M., Dundas, R., & Holland, W. W. (1997). Sickness absence and ‚Äòworking through‚Äô illness: A comparison of two professional groups. Journal of Public Health Medicine, 19, 295‚Äì300. In some cases, general practitioners did not want to burden their partners, and many felt a strong commitment to the job that prevented them from taking sick leave. =Workloads and job demands= Jobs that have large workloads and many demands are often associated with higher levels of presenteeism. Caverely, Cunningham, and Macgregor studied Canadian firms and noted that presenteeism was often not the result of job insecurity.Caverley, N., Cunningham, J. B., & MacGregor, J. N. (2007). Sickness presenteeism, sickness absenteeism, and health following restructuring in a public service organization. Journal of Management Studies, 44, 304‚Äì319. Instead individuals felt they had to come to work while ill or injured because they believed they had high workloads, many deadlines, and often very little backup support. Complementing this finding, McKevitt et al. also found that individuals feared their work would pile up if they did not go to their job. Moreover, Demerouti, Le Blanc, Bakker, Schaufeli, and Hox examined job demands and found that they had a positive relationship with presenteeism.Demerouti, E., Le Blanc, P. M., Bakker, A. B., Schaufeli, W. B., & Hox, J. (2009). Present but sick: A three-wave study on job demands, presenteeism and burnout. Career Development International, 14, 50‚Äì68. In the case of this study, the authors defined job demands as aspects of the job that require physical and/or psychological effort. =Workaholism= Those who exhibit workaholism tend to demonstrate higher levels of presenteeism. As defined by Schaufeli, Bakker, van der Heijden, and Prins, workaholics tend to work excessively and compulsively, and they are internally motivated to work to an excessive extent.Schaufeli, W., Bakker, A., van der Heijden, F., & Prins, J. (2009). Workaholism among medical residents: It is the combination of working excessively and compulsively that counts. International Journal of Stress Management, 16, 249-272. In addition to their high levels of presenteeism, Schaufeli et al. discovered that workaholics also displayed the highest burnout and lowest happiness levels relative to other groups who were not defined as workaholics. =Performance-based self-esteem= Performance- based self-esteem (PBSE) has also been considered another antecedent of presenteeism. This term describes the idea that individuals‚Äô self-esteem may depend on their performance.Love, J., Grimby-Ekman, A., Eklof, M., Hagberg, M., & Dellve, L. (2010). \\"Pushing oneself too hard\\": Performance-based self- esteem as a predictor of sickness presenteeism among young adult women and men‚ÄîA cohort study. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 52, 603-609. Employees who demonstrate high levels of this construct have to prove their worth while on the job. Love et al. found that PBSE positively predicted presenteeism; however, the authors also discovered that the relationship between PBSE and presenteeism was strengthened when workers experienced high physical and psychological work demands. This finding suggested that demanding work environments could interact with employees‚Äô overambitious work styles, which could result in over performance and increased levels of presenteeism. =Health factors= Certain health factors serve as risk factors for presenteeism as opposed to absenteeism. Boles, Pelletier, and Lynch examined a variety of emotional and physical health symptoms and noted that the odds of reporting presenteeism were largest for those with high stress compared to those without stress.Boles, M., Pelletier, B., & Lynch, W. (2004). The relationship between health risks and work productivity. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 46, 737‚Äì745. Those with poor diet and less emotional fulfillment also reported higher levels of presenteeism than those without these conditions. The researchers noted that individuals with diabetes tended to report higher levels of absenteeism as opposed to those without the condition. Individuals who partook in no physical activity were more prone to report higher levels of both absenteeism and presenteeism compared to those who took part in some physical activity. Consequences =Productivity loss= One consequence of presenteeism is productivity loss, and scholars have attempted to estimate these productivity numbers. While examining productivity decrements, however, it is implied that losses are measured relative to not having a particular sickness or health issue. Furthermore, in comparison to being absent from a job, those exhibiting presenteeism may be far more productive. Nonetheless, a large study by Goetzel et al. estimated that on average in the United States, an employee‚Äôs presenteeism costs or lost on-the-job productivity are approximately $255.Goetzel, R. Z., Long, S. R., Ozminkowski, R. J., Hawkins, K., Wang, S., & Lynch, W. (2004). Health, absence, disability, and presenteeism cost estimates of certain physical and mental health conditions affecting U.S. employees. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 46, 398‚Äì412. Furthermore, the authors concluded that of all the health related costs faced by employers, one fifth to three fifths of those expenses could be attributable to on-the-job productivity losses. Complementing that study, Schultz and Edington provided a detailed review of the effects of certain health conditions on productivity.Schultz, A. B., & Edington, D. W. (2007). Employee health and presenteeism: A systematic review. Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation, 17, 547‚Äì579. These authors examined conditions such as allergies, arthritis, chronic pain, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The studies in the review showed, for example, that increases in pollen are associated with decreased performance.Burton, W., Conti, D., Chen, C., Schultz, A., & Edington, D. (2001). The impact of allergies and allergy treatment on productivity. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 43, 64-71. Moreover, Schultz and Edington noted that chronic pain had to be studied more thoroughly to better understand its effects on productivity. =Poor health and exhaustion= Exhaustion and future poor health are often other consequences of presenteeism. For example, Bergstrom, Bodin, Hagberg, Aronsson, and Josephson found that sickness presenteeism was a risk factor for future sick leave.Bergstr√∂m, G., Bodin, L., Hagberg, J., Aronnson, G., & Josephson, M. (2009). Sickness presenteeism today, sickness absenteeism tomorrow? A prospective study on sickness presenteeism and future sickness absenteeism. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 51, 629-638. Furthermore, in their study of job demands and presenteeism, Demerouti et al. found that presenteeism resulted in increased exhaustion. Presenteeism can also have an effect on occupational injuries for workers. A 2012 study from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health showed that workers with access to paid sick leave were 28% less likely overall to suffer nonfatal injuries than workers without access to paid sick leave.Asfaw, A., Cryan, R., & Rosa, R.(2012). Paid sick leave and nonfatal occupational injuries. American Journal of Public Health, 102(9), e59-e64. =Workplace epidemics= In the case of an infectious disease such as influenza, a culture of presenteeism will inevitably also lead to further infections throughout the workforce, compounding the ill-effects and leading to a much wider problem. In a 2014 survey by Canada Life Insurance, over 80% of respondents stated that they had become ill as a result of an infection contracted in the workplace.Presenteeism: a ticking workplace timebomb? Measurement of presenteeism and its impact on productivity Scholars have often measured presenteeism in terms of how often an individual attends work while unhealthy. For instance, Aronsson et al. asked participants to what extent over the past year they had gone to work despite feeling they should have taken sick leave. Respondents could choose from never, once, between two and 5 times, and more than 5 times. Other researchers have examined the frequency of presenteeism by asking participants a similar question. The responses, however, were on a scale of \\"spells of one day presenteeism, spells of 2-4 day presenteeism, and spells of 5 day or more presenteeism.\\"Munir, F., Yarker, J., Haslam, C., Long, H., Leka, S., Griffeths, A., & Cox, C. (2007). Work factors related to psychological and health-related distress among employees with chronic illnesses. Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation, 17, 259‚Äì277. Aside from measuring the frequency of presenteeism, scholars often look to measure the effects of poor health on job productivity. The Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) is often used to perform this task.Lerner, D., Amick, B. C., Rogers, W. H., Malspeis, S., Bungay, K., & Cynn, D. (2001). The work limitations questionnaire. Medical Care, 39, 72‚Äì85. With 25 items, it examines the extent to which respondents can handle time, physical, mental-interpersonal, and output demands. Additionally, The Stanford Presenteeism Scale seeks to determine the effects of health on productivity. It measures participants‚Äô abilities to concentrate and perform work despite having a primary health problem.Koopman, C., Pelletier, K. R., Murray, J. F., Sharda, C. E., Berger, M. L., Turpin, R. S. (2002). Stanford Presenteeism Scale: Health status and employee productivity. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 44, 14‚Äì20. Using six items, respondents determine the extent to which they agree with statements that describe how their health condition may or may not affect their work. The scale measures two factors that the authors labeled as completing work and avoiding distraction. Finally, another measure often used is the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ).Kessler, R., Barber C., Beck A., Berglund, P., Clearly, P., McKenas, D., Pronk, N., Simon, G., Stang., P., Ustun, T., & Wang, P. (2003). The World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 45, 156-174. This self-report measure acquires information about respondents‚Äô health conditions and has them provide perceptions of their job performance. The WLQ and HPQ have become the two most popular instruments; however, one can access more thorough reviews of instruments that have been created to estimate the effects of health on productivity.Lofland, J. H., Pizzi, L., & Frick, K. D. (2004). A review of health-related workplace productivity loss instruments. Pharmacoeconomics, 22, 165‚Äì184. doi: 1170-7690/04/0003-0165/$31.00/0 Implications for practice Given the prominence and costs of presenteeism, scholars have suggested a variety of courses of action for employers. Companies should implement wellness programs for their employees aimed at increasing health and productivity. These organizations, however, must be aware that the effects of these programs may have an immediate impact on presenteeism as opposed to simply absenteeism. Firms must be cognizant of this fact when evaluating the effectiveness of their programs. Complementing this suggestion, Schultz and Edington wrote that employees must be educated effectively so they can better manage their health. They also commented that employers need to consider the health of workers who are low risk along with those who have high-risk health conditions. In the United States, one other proposed response has been to require that paid sick and family leave be provided to all workers. In November 2006, San Francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass such a law.Zappone, Christian \\"Paid sick leave may be next big cause.\\" CNN Money (November 17, 2006) Future directions and research While progress has been made in regards to understanding presenteeism, many possible topics of inquiry still remain. In his literature review, Johns said that presenteeism had to be related to other constructs such as work attitudes and personality. Additionally, lessons from absenteeism could be applied to presenteeism. For instance, absenteeism can be defined as voluntary and involuntary, and scholars could consider applying such ideas to presenteeism. Lastly, the construct could be related to other elements of the work. Specifically, how does presenteeism relate to telework? Is an individual who works from home while he or she is sick exhibiting presenteeism?

Biography  =Education= Born at Oxford in 1550, George Nichols entered Brasenose College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, in 1564 or 1565 where he received his B.A. degree in 1571. He went on to become an usher and a teacher at St. Paul's School in London where he was received into the Catholic Church. Nichols went overseas in November 1581 to enroll at the Douai College (located in Rheims at the time); which was a seminary for English Catholic priests. He became a subdeacon and deacon in April 1583, and was shortly afterwards ordained a priest by Louis II, Cardinal of Guise on 24 September 1583. That same year he was sent back to Oxford for his mission. =Arrest and death= In Oxford, Catholicism was increasing rapidly. Nichols during this time had converted many to the Catholic faith, notably a convicted highwayman in Oxford Castle. In May 1589 he was arrested at the Catherine Wheel Inn, opposite St Mary Magdalen Church in Oxford, with another priest Richard Yaxley, and two laymen, Humphrey Pritchard and Thomas Belson. The men were accused of treason in accordance to a statute issued by Parliament following the Papal bull issued by Pope Pius V. The four men were ultimately sent to Bridewell Prison in London, where Nichols and Yaxley were hung from their hands for up to fifteen hours to make them betray their faith, but without any success. Nichols was then separated from the rest of the three prisoners and put into a dungeon full of vermin. On 30 June all four were ordered back to Oxford for their trial. Nichols and his fellow prisoners were tried under the recent statute imposing the death sentence on any Englishman ordained abroad who entered England and on anyone helping such a person. All were condemned, the priests for treason, the laymen for felony. On 5 July 1589, Nichols and Yaxley were hanged, drawn, and quartered in Holywell, Oxford, while Belson and Prichard were hanged. George Nichols, having been refused permission to address the crowd, made it clear that he was being executed merely because he was a priest. After the execution the priests' heads were set up on the castle, and their quarters on the four city gates. The severity of the punishment seemed to have an effect on the people of Oxford for it would be 20 years before another Catholic recusant was executed in Oxford. In 1987, Nichols and the three other prisoners were among eighty- five martyrs of England and Wales to be beatified by Pope John Paul II. A memorial to these four Roman Catholic martyrs was erected on the nearest house to the Holywell Gallows in October 2008.

Eupatoria was in the midst of the plain called Phanaroea, whereas Cabira, as Strabo says was at the base of the Paryadres. Mithridates the Great built a palace at Cabira; and there was a water-mill there (Greek: ·ΩëŒ¥œÅŒ±ŒªŒ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ), and places for keeping wild animals, hunting grounds, and mines. Less than 200 stadia from Cabira was the remarkable rock or fortress called Caenon (Greek: ŒöŒ±ŒπŒΩœåŒΩ [œáœâœÅŒØŒøŒΩ]), where Mithridates kept his most valuable things. Cn. Pompeius took the place and its treasures, which, when Strabo wrote, were in the Roman Capitol. In Strabo's time a woman, Pythodoris, the widow of King Polemon, had Cabira with the Zelitis and Magnopolitis. Pompeius made Cabira a city, and gave it the name Diospolis (ŒîŒπœåœÉœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ). Pythodoris enlarged it, gave it the name Sebaste (Œ£ŒµŒ≤Œ±œÉœÑŒÆ), which is the Greek equivalent to Augusta, and used it as her royal residence. Near Cabira probably at a village named Ameria, there was a temple with a great number of slaves belonging to it, and the high priest enjoyed this benefice.the text of Strabo is a little uncertain, and not quite clear; Groskurd, transl. vol. ii. p. 491, n. The god Men of Pharnaces (ŒúŒÆŒΩ Œ¶Œ±œÅŒΩŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÖ) was worshipped at Cabira. Mithridates was at Cabira during the winter that L. Lucullus was besieging Amisus and Eupatoria.Appian, Mithrid. c. 78. Lucullus afterwards took Cabira.Plutarch, Lucullus, c. 18. There are some autonomous coins of Cabira with the epigraph \\"ŒöŒ±Œ≤Œ∑œÅœâŒΩ\\". Strabo, a native of Amasia, could not be unacquainted with the site of Cabira. The only place that corresponds to his description is Niksar, on the right bank of the Lycus, nearly 43 km from the junction of the Iris and the Lycus. But Niksar is the ancient Neocaesarea, a name which first occurs in Pliny, who says that it is on the Lycus. There is no trace of any ancient city between Niksar and the junction of the two rivers, and the conclusion that Niksar is a later name of Cabira, and a name more recent than Sebaste, seems certain. Neocaesarea seems to have arisen under the early Roman emperors. John Cramer states that the earliest coins of Neocaesarea bear the effigy of Tiberius;John Cramer Asia Minor, vol. i. p. 315. but Sestini, quoted by Albert Forbiger, assigns the origin of Neocaesarea to the time of Nero, about 64 CE, when Pontus Polemoniacus was made a Roman province.Albert Forbiger, Geog. vol. ii. p. 428. The simplest solution of this question is that Neocaesarea was a new town, which might be near the site of Cabira. It was the capital of Pontus Polemoniacus, the birthplace of Gregorius Thaumaturgus, and the place of assembly of a church council in 314. Ammianus Marcellinus calls it the most noted city of Pontus Polemoniacus: it was, in fact, the metropolis.Ammianus Marcellinus 27.12. According to Paulus Diaconus the place was destroyed by an earthquake. Cramer supposes that Neocaesarea is identical with Ameria, and he adds that Neocaesarea was the principal seat of pagan idolatry and superstitions, which affords another presumption that it had risen on the foundation of Ameria and the worship of Men Pharnaces. But Ameria seems to have been at or near Cabira; and all difficulties are reconciled by supposing that Cabira, Ameria, Neocaesarea were in the valley of the Lycus, and if not on the same spot, at least very near to one another. Stephanus of Byzantium adds to our difficulties by saying or seeming to say that the inhabitants were also called Adrianopolitae, suggesting that Adrianopolis or Hadrianopolis was still another name of the city in his time. Where he got this from, nobody can tell. Modern scholars identify Hadriane as a name borne by the town. Hamilton was informed at Niksar that on the road from Niksar to Sivas, and about fourteen hours from Niksar, there is a high perpendicular rock, almost inaccessible on all sides, with a stream of water flowing from the top, and a river at its base. This is exactly Strabo's description of Caenon. Modern scholars fix its site at modern Niksar, Asiatic Turkey.

The music was written by Les Brown and Ben Homer, and the lyrics were written by Bud Green. History Les Brown and His Band of Renown had been performing the song, but were unable to record it because of the 1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike. When the strike ended, the band, with Doris Day as vocalist, had a hit record with the song, Day's first #1 hit, in 1945. The song's release coincided with the end of the Second World War in Europe and became the unofficial homecoming theme for many veterans. The recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 36769, with the flip side \\"Twilight Time\\".Columbia Records in the 36500 to 36999 series The record first reached the Billboard charts on March 29, 1945 and lasted 23 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1. The song actually reached the charts after the later-recorded \\"My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time\\". About this same time, the Merry Macs had a recording following Brown and Day which featured a bouncy arrangement where the group modulates (or augments) the verse eight times in the last half of the song. A vocal feat for any group attempting to record a song in one take without the benefit of tape editing in that era of modern recording. The song later became something of a standard with jazz artists and was recorded by, among others, Buck Clayton with Woody Herman and by Ben Sidran. Frank Sinatra recorded his version of the song in 1961. Rosemary Clooney issued an album Sentimental Journey (2001) which included the song. Harry James recorded a version in 1965 on his album New Versions Of Down Beat Favorites (MGM E-4265).  Lyrics  The song describes someone about to take a train to a place to which they have a great emotional attachment and their mounting anticipation while wondering why they ever roamed away. The opening verse is: Gonna take a sentimental journey Gonna set my heart at ease Gonna make a sentimental journey To renew old memories.

It is approximately 14 kilometers long stretching east-west, and between 1 and 3 kilometers wide, located in an expanse of hills known as Tama Hills about 20 kilometers west of the center of the special wards of Tokyo. It currently has a population of about 200,000, making it the largest housing development in Japan. History During the Japanese post-war economic miracle, a rapid influx of population into Tokyo led land prices to skyrocket, causing many to settle on the cheaper outskirts of the city, leading to an unplanned, rapid urban sprawl. It was feared that, left to its own devices, the uncontrolled expansion of built-up areas would lead to poorly planned communities with insufficient infrastructure to support the population and with poor access to amenities and transport. Tama New Town was planned in 1965 to attempt to ease this pressure by providing hundreds of thousands with housing in a planned, pleasant urban environment. The planning and development was carried out jointly by The Housing and Urban Development Corporation, Tokyo Metropolitan Housing Supply Corporation and Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The original planned population was 342,200, and the designated area was 2,892.1 hectares. Construction began the following year and the first phase opened in 1971. Construction continued in phases for the next few decades. Urban design and facilities Part of the master plan was to segregate motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic It is divided into 21 neighborhoods, each with about 3000 to 5000 houses and apartments, each with two elementary schools and one junior high school as well as a neighborhood center with shops, k≈çban, post office, clinics and the like. Several neighborhoods form one district, each of which are centered on a commuter rail station. Tama New Town is not a municipality in itself; instead, it straddles the pre-existing boundaries of Tama, Hachi≈çji, Inagi and Machida cities, and each area is administered by its respective municipal authorities, all of which come under the jurisdiction of Tokyo Metropolis. =Tama Center= The area surrounding the Tama Center Station complex, in the municipality of Tama, is the designated center of Tama New Town. The area is separated into business, commercial and leisure zones. Tama Center Station itself is serviced by the Tama Toshi Monorail Line, as well as Keio Sagamihara and Odakyu Tama Lines which links it to Shinjuku Station in central Tokyo. The station complex also includes shopping arcades and a bus terminal. * Parthenon Avenue, the main thoroughfare of the Tama Center area famous for its winter illuminations, stretches southwards from the station. In the vicinity are retail, business and leisure complexes, hotels, Tama City Central Police Station, an indoor theme park (Sanrio Puroland or \\"Hello-kitty land\\"), Warner-Mycal Cinema cineplex, Tama Art University Gallery, Tama TV and Tama South District Hospital. * Parthenon Tama, a huge culture center, is located at the end of Parthenon Avenue. The building, nicknamed so after Parthenon in Greece because of its hilltop location, houses a free museum about the history of Tama New Town. Behind Parthenon Tama lies Tama Central Park (Tama Chuo Koen) and a neighbouring Shinto shrine. =Other districts= Other notable hubs in Tama New Town include: * Within Tama city: The area surrounding Nagayama Station, comprising several retail complexes such as Greenade Nagayama, as well as Nagayama Civic Hall. * Within Inagi city: The area surrounding Wakabadai Station has developed rapidly in recent years following the completion of the final phase of Tama New Town to the north of the station. Multiple retail complexes have opened since 2004, as well as a planned culture complex including a 400-seat auditorium, library, and a children's center. * Within Hachi≈çji city: The new Greenwalk Tama shopping center opened in spring 2007, about 2.5 km southwest of Tama Center, along the main east-west highway. Panoramic view of Tama New Town Transportation Tama-Center Station, served by Keio Sagamihara Line, Odakyu Tama Line and Tama Toshi Monorail Tama New Town is served by more than ten railway stations, most of them on the Keio Sagamihara Line and Odakyu Tama Line, both of which provide a direct service to Shinjuku Station in central Tokyo. JR Nambu Line and Tama Toshi Monorail Line also serve the area. Higher education Chuo University Tokyo Metropolitan University Tama New Town is home to 16 university and college campuses. * Chuo University * Digital Hollywood University * Keisen University * Kokushikan University * Komazawa Women's University * Komazawa Women's Junior College * Meisei University * Otsuma Women's University * Salesian Polytechnic * Tama Art University * Teikyo University * Tokyo Metropolitan University (Public) * Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences * University of Tokyo Health Sciences * Yamazaki College of Animal Health Technology Media Tama Television (TTV) is a cable TV and internet provider, servicing the Tama New Town area as well as other parts of Tama and Inagi municipalities, and has its own channel providing community news and the like. FM Tama G-Wind (77.6 MHz/10W) is the radio station dedicated to the local area. In fiction * The 1994 Studio Ghibli film Pom Poko depicts the expansion of Tama New Town in the 1960s through the eyes of shapeshifting tanuki (raccoon dogs) and their attempts to stop it. * The 1995 Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart is also set in Tama New Town. Many places near Seiseki- Sakuragaoka Station appear in the film, although the area is depicted as more developed than it was when the film was made.Photos of the town used as a background See also References Western Tokyo New towns in Japan Hachi≈çji, Tokyo Tama, Tokyo Inagi, Tokyo Machida, Tokyo New towns started in the 1960s ","title":"Tama New Town"},{"id":"2954441","text":"Madballs is a series of toy foam balls originally created by AmToy, a subsidiary company of American Greetings (Now Cloudco Entertainment) in the mid-1980s, later being revived by Art Asylum (2007‚Äì2008) and Just Play, Inc. (2017‚Äì2019). The balls incorporated gross-out humor and each was given a character synopsis and an odd name. The toyline expanded into a franchise with comic books, direct-to-video cartoons, and a video game for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. Overview The toys were rubber or foam collectible bouncing balls with grotesque faces and designs. The toys sold well as a passing fad. There were two series of the original Madballs collectible toys. Each series consisted of eight balls, as well as a collection of Super Madballs, a larger version of the original Madballs shaped like other sports balls, such as the American football-shaped \\"Touchdown Terror\\", the soccer ball-shaped \\"Goal Eater\\" and the basketball-shaped \\"Foul Shot\\". Toys =Original series Madballs= * Screamin' Meemie: A screaming baseball with a large tongue. * Slobulus: A drooling green creature with one eye hanging out of its socket. * Aargh: A one-eyed blue-skinned Frankenstein monster-esque creature with stitching all over its face. * Horn Head: A horned cyclops with a nose ring (which is chained to its ear in the Art Asylum era). * Dust Brain: A mummy with rotting teeth and wrinkly teal skin. * Oculus Orbus: A bloodshot eyeball (later sporting a mouth in the Just Play era). * Skull Face: A skull with large eye sockets sporting tiny red eyes, a big set of teeth, and a partially exposed brain (which is depicted as a sentient being in the Just Play era). * Bash Brain: A gory zombie head with a partially exposed brain. This Madball was originally named \\"Crack Head\\", but was later renamed \\"Bash Brain\\", due to the unpleasant connotations of crackhead as a slang term for a drug user. All Madballs toys were conceived in the early 1980s by the creative team at American Greetings Properties, which was formally named Those Characters From Cleveland, or TCFC for short: Ralph Shafer, George Chanter, Mark Spangler, Jim Elliott, Kim Hammeren and Vint Gonser. Editorial by Clark Wiley and Tom Jacobs. =Second series Madballs= * Snake Bait: A forked tongue-sporting gorgon (later depicted in the Just Play era as a monster being devoured by a snake). * Freaky Fullback: A mutant football player. * Splitting Headache: A monster with the skin on half of its face peeled off. * Bruise Brother: An ugly biker with a battered blue helmet. * Wolf Breath: A werewolf with large, rotten fangs dripping with blood (drool in the Art Asylum era). * Fist Face: A severed hand clutching an eyeball (later depicted as a severed head with an eyeball emerging from it in the Just Play era). * Swine Sucker: An ugly, drooling wild boar. * Lock Lips: A creature with its jaw locked shut and one eye covered by a riveted plate. =Super Madballs= * Touchdown Terror: An American football with a manic grin and missile-like fins and tip. * Goal Eater: A soccer ball with very large pointed teeth. * Foul Shot: A basketball bursting open to reveal a face with worms crawling out of one eye socket. =Head-Popping Madballs= These were posable figures, with an ejectable/swappable head: *Dust Brain, Skull Face, Screamin' Meemie, Oculus Orbus, Horn Head and Slobulus from Series 1. *Bruise Brother, Wolf Breath and Lock Lips from Series 2. =Similar imitation toys= Due to the popularity of the Madballs, there were many similar imitation toys, such as: *\\"Blurp Balls\\" by ERTL ‚Äì Boney Tossteeth, T-Retch, Count Heave-A-Heart, Spittooey Sooey, Biff Barfball, Sharkey Skullsquert, Retch-A-Rat Tomcat, and Croakey Bugchuck. These toys were designed by artist James Groman, with character names and editorial by Rick Reising. *\\"Weird Balls\\" by The Mel Appel Company ‚Äì Sewer Face, Brain Ball, Wart Hog, Spit Ball, Shrink Head, and Rock Slime. *\\"Spit Balls\\" by Lanard Toys ‚Äì Sharky, 20/20, Ba- Boom, and Crybaby. =Original Madballs re-release= In 2016, the vinyl figure company Kidrobot released nine of the original Madballs in their original foam style, slightly modified. They also released keychains and vinyl figure blind boxes. These are the Madballs that were released: *Screamin' Meemie *Oculus Orbus *Slobulus *Skull Face *Horn Head *Dust Brain *Freaky Fullback *Swine Sucker *Lock Lips Home video Madballs: Escape from Orb VHS front cover Unlike many high-profile toylines at the time, the Madballs did not have an accompanying television series. They did, however, have two direct-to-home video cartoons released by Nelvana. The first one, released in 1986, was a 22-minute episode called Madballs: Escape from Orb in which the titular characters are a rock and roll band who performs across the galaxy, but heads for Earth, as music is illegal on their home planet, Orb. The video also featured a female, cartoon-exclusive Madball named Freakella, modeled after the Bride of Frankenstein. It was directed by Laura Shepherd are written by Heather MacGillvray and John de Klein. The second one, released in 1987, was another 22-minute episode called Madballs: Gross Jokes that was a series of jokes and skits performed by the Madballs. Both of these releases are only available on VHS and are not yet available on either DVD or Blu-ray. =Cast= * Screamin' Meemie: A baseball with an eerie grin. He is apparently the Madballs' leader, as he often refers to his friends as the \\"gang\\". He also seems to be a friend of Freakella, because they are seen together near the end of the introduction and he is often seen speaking with her. He was voiced by Geoffrey Bowes. * Horn Head: A cyclops face with a horn. He is the strongest member of the group. He was voiced by Keith Hampshire. * Aargh: A blue-skinned Frankenstein monster-esque Madball with one eye completely open and the other one completely shut. He is friends with Slobulus, even though he often abuses him and the two of them argue a lot, especially over which one of them is the Madballs' biggest fan. He was voiced by John Stocker. * Skull Face: A skull with a smile who is best friends with Horn Head and Dusty Dustbrain. He speaks with a slight stutter. He was also voiced by John Stocker. * Dusty Dustbrain: A very intelligent mummy. He was voiced by Jeri Craden. * Freakella: A Bride of Frankenstein-esque Madball who hates being called \\"Mophead\\". She was voiced by Cree Summer in the first video and Taborah Johnson in the second video. * Slobulus: A drooling face with one eye hanging from the socket. He is friends with Aargh, even though Aargh often abuses him and the two of them often argue a lot, especially over which one of them is the Madballs' biggest fan. He was voiced by Dan Hennessey. * Bruise Brother: One of the evil Badballs who looks like a biker with a German helmet, eye patch and beard. He is Wolf Breath's right-hand man, also voiced by Dan Hennessey. * Freaky Fullback: A purple monster wearing an orange football helmet, also voiced by Dan Hennessey. * Oculus Orbus: A giant eyeball, voiced by Len Carlson. * Bash Brain: A normal face with its scalp ripped off to expose its brain, also voiced by Len Carlson. He made a cameo in Madballs: Escape from Orb and his first full appearance was in Madballs: Gross Jokes. * Wolf Breath: The leader of the evil Badballs. He is a werewolf who has a habit of using breath spray frequently, voiced by Don Francks. * Skip: The Madballs' manager on Earth, voiced by Christopher Ward. * Sandy: Skip's sister, voiced by Alyson Court. Comic books Marvel Comics' former children's comics subsidiary, Star Comics, released a three-issue miniseries (September-November 1986),which continued with issue #4 (June 1987) as a bi-monthly comic book. The series was cancelled with issue #10 (June 1988). The main villains of the comic book were Dr. Frankenbeans, who was in many ways similar to Victor Frankenstein, and his bumbling assistant Schnivelitch, who resembled Igor. Marvel UK released a one- shot Madballs Annual (1988). Produced by Marvel in hardcover format, it reprints the comic book story of the creation of the Madballs by Dr. Frankenbeans, and also features games and activities. Madballs re-releases In early 2006, toy company Art Asylum announced that it had partnered with original rights holder American Greetings to revive the Madballs toys, with both classic characters and new designs. Toy company, Basic Fun Inc., took up the task of producing/selling the new Madballs designed by artist James Groman, who worked on the original line. As of November 2007, the toys began appearing in toy stores in the U.S. =Classic Series 1= Madballs Classic Series 1 consists of five re-designed Madballs characters from the original Series 1 (Screamin' Meemie, Skull Face, Bash Brain, Slobulus and Horn Head) and also the first new Madballs character since the toyline's original demise in the mid- to late 1980s: Repvile, an angry, blue, scabrous reptilian. Newly designed sculpts for two other Madballs, Dust Brain and Freaky Fullback, as well as Super Madball Touchdown Terror, were also shown at Toy Fair and Comic- Con 2006, but they were never released. American Greetings also hinted at the creation of a \\"Goalrilla\\" Super Madball which would mimic the design of a soccer ball (possibly a redesign of the original \\"Goal Eater\\" Madball). Aargh from the original Series 1 is the only standard-sized toy that was not redesigned or mooted for redesign, although Repvile seems to be a homage to the original Aargh Madball. =Classic Series 2= Six more Madballs forming Classic Series 2 were released in the U.S. in 2008 (Freaky Fullback, Wolf Breath and Swine Sucker from the original Series 2, plus Dust Brain and Oculus Orbus from the original Series 1 and new Madball Blech Beard, a puntastically named ghastly pirate). The rebooted Madballs line was noted for its vastly more detailed sculpts; this was especially noticeable in the redesigned original characters. =Sick Series 1 and Sick Series 2= In addition to the standard Madballs Classic Series, there was an entirely new Madballs variant in stores called Madballs Sick Series. Each of the (so far released) two series in this line featured three re-designed Madballs characters from the Classic Series (Bash Brain, Slobulus and Skull Face composed Sick Series 1 and Freaky Fullback, Dust Brain and Blech Beard composed Sick Series 2) which could be squeezed to reveal their insides (for example, Bash Brain had brains that bubbled, Slobulus contained eyeballs that popped out and Skull Face concealed spiders that squirmed out). =Classic Series 3 and Classic Series 4= Two more Madballs series, Classic Series 3 and Classic Series 4, were planned but never made (however, see next section below). = Madballs by Megalopolis Toys= Legendary toy designer James Groman has shared previews for two upcoming Madballs 6‚Ä≥ Scale Action Figures, which will be coming from Megalopolis Toys. The figures were announced back in June. These 6‚Ä≥ scale figure will feature weapons and interchangeable parts. They are modeled after the classic ‚ÄúHead Popping‚Äù Madballs figures from the late 1980‚Äôs. However, these do not feature the head popping gimmick, opting for articulation and a more ‚Äúaction figure‚Äù-like approach. The images showcase both Horn Head and Splitting Headache, and will be part of the Premium DNA toy line.https://news.toyark.com/2020/07/24/preview-of-two-upcoming-madballs- action-figures-from-megalopolis-396414 International modern revival In 2009 European territories, including Italy and the U.K., began receiving a series of 10 officially licensed miniature water-squirting Giraprendi Madballs. The Italian Madballs are slightly larger (golf ball-sized) and more rubbery than their U.K. counterparts. In the U.K., they are dispensed sealed in small semi-transparent plastic spheres from vending machines which also distributed Nintendo- and Disney-branded toys. Some of the toys are based on the planned (but never made) Classic Series 3 and Classic Series 4 Madballs, some simply with name changes; others are entirely new creations. They are as follows: *Scum Chum: A mutant anglerfish. *Brain Rot: A zombie scientist. *Creep Frog: A horrid frog with a mouthful of mini-beasts. *Flea Bag: A hideous cat/dog hybrid. *Spews Ooze: A psychotic dragon impaled with weapons and armor. *Deck Head: A skater speared with a skateboard. *Eye Sore: An abomination with mouths for eyes and eyes for a mouth. *Spit Bull: A rabid, branded bull. *Racket Attack: A mauled tennis player. *Fang Thang: A saber- toothed cat eating a caveman. Video games A video game based on the toy franchise, simply titled Madballs, was published in 1988 by Ocean Software for a variety of then-popular 8-bit home computers. It was a top-down view action game and received poor to average reviews from the gaming media. As part of the E3 videogame show, it was announced on May 31, 2009 that Canadian game developer PlayBrains was releasing a video game sequel to BaboViolent 2, including Madballs characters called Madballs in Babo: Invasion. It was released for Xbox Live Arcade on July 15, 2009. The gameplay involves rolling around expansive terrain maps carrying large weaponry (machine guns, etc.) and causing mass destruction. It also includes four player co-op, team v. team and free-for-all modes over Xbox Live, in addition to a unique multiplayer mode where two teams of players build their side of the map, then attack a base on the other team's side. There is also a multiplayer mode where people can play as the head of their Xbox Live avatars. Of the characters in the game, only two are Madballs: Oculus Orbus and Horn Head. An iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad game based on the Madballs characters titled Babo Crash HD was also released. 2017 animated shorts In addition to the new product line, AGE and Just Play joined together with Oddbot Studios to produce new animated Madballs shorts. Released on the Madballs YouTube channel on March 1, 2017, the cartoon features the six core characters ‚Äì Skullface, Horn Head, Screamin' Meemie, Oculus Orbus, Dust Brain and Slobulus.

Several are lathe-turned. This Samad Late Iron Age grave is viewed vertically. At the north-west end (left) the body was inserted head first. Samad al-Shan (22¬∞48'N; 58¬∞09'E, altitude 565 m) is an archaeological site in the Sharqiyah province, Oman where Late Iron Age remains were first identified, hence the Samad Period or assemblage.Paul Yule, Die Gr√§berfelder in Samad al-Shan (Sultanat Oman) Materialien zu einer Kulturgeschichte.

This oasis is located 2 km east of the village of \\"al-Maysar\\" (since c. 1995 al-Moyassar). In 1976 a small part of site was discovered by British archaeological surveyors.D.B. Doe, Gazetteer, Journal Oman Studies 2, 1976, 46, pl. IX (map). The archaeologist Gerd Weisgerber began mapping in 1981. The excavation of this site (1981‚Äì82) by Burkhard Vogt, Gerd Weisgerber and Paul Yule, (1987‚Äì98) of the German Mining Museum, Bochum and later University of Heidelberg documented some 260 graves which span the Bronze Age to Late Iron Age, which are particular to the Sultanate of Oman. Samad is the type-site for the non-writing Late Iron Age of Central Oman in south-eastern Arabia. This cultural assemblage evidences occasional examples of in the form of characters scratched onto pottery vessels. In 2016 and 2018 Yule re-focussed the characterisation of the Samad assemblage and the ethno-linguistic identity of its population. The subterranean stone graves in Central Oman range from fairly simple to elaborate and up to 9 m in length (at Feg). Manfred Kunter first determined that biologically defined mature males usually are placed the right side and mature females on the left. The graves and grave goods of the deceased of both sexes range from low to high status (grave size, number and kind of grave equipment).Manfred Kunter, Bronze und eisenzeitliche Skelettfunde aus Oman: Bemerkungen zur Bev√∂lkerungsgeschichte Ostarabiens, Homo 32, 1981, 197-210 . Individuals with more robust skeletons (heavier bones and heavier muscle attachment marks) tend to have better graves and grave goods. More than twice as many men have graves than women, still fewer children's graves came to light. However, the children may have been buried in separate unexcavated parts of the cemeteries. If more men had better graves, then men probably also had during their lives, more property rights than did women. The graves of biological males contain weapons, especially arrow-heads, quiver remains and daggers, as opposed to biological women's grave in which weapons never occur. Both men and women wore beads. The local pottery is hand- made and imported glazed 'perfume bottles' and balsamaria are wheel-turned. Several soft stone bowls are lathe-turned. Some finds have not survived, especially organic ones and most objects in precious metal. Missing, but expected, are clothing, leather articles such as shoes, liquid containers and shields, arrow shafts, bows and woven basketry. In the after-life one would have need to draw water, but nothing of the sort has survived. A few of the grave goods are damaged, for whatever reason. Neither body painting nor tattooing survived. Who you are affects how you are buried and the individual bits that make up your identity get represented in various ways.Mike Parker Pearson, Archaeology of death and burial, Sutton: Stroud, 1999, page 29, . Regardless of their origin, as we know them today, the Samad Late Iron Age population are date farmers and not herders, who migrate between winter and summer pasturage. But there are several stages of transition from herders to settlers, from pastoralists to nomads and pastoral life is an essential part of farming.Hermann von Wissmann and Friedrich Kussmaul, Badw, Encyclopedia of Islam vol. 1, Leiden, page 874, . Aside from the catastrophic dentitions,M. Kunter, Chronologische und regionale Unterschiede bei pathologischen Zahnbefunden auf der Arabischen Halbinsel, Arch√§ologisches Korespondenzblatt 13, 1983, 339-43 , the result of the date diet, nothing in the graves reveals the economy either as farmers or as herdsmen. In the late 1st millennium BCE, strictly speaking the reference to this population as Bedouins seems a mediocre fit.Jan Rets√∂, The Arabs in Antiquity, London, 2003, pages 82-3, Disparate social ranks in the population contradict the usual lack of ranking within Bedouin tribal groups.Louise Sweet, Camel raiding of North Arabian Bedouin: A mechanism of ecological adaptation, American anthropologist ns 67,5,1, Oct. 1965, page 1134. Such accumulations of wealth arise more readily in a sedentary than pastoral environment. Not copies of tents, but rather of houses, the heavy stone graves show their maker's value for a sedentary kind of dwelling in the afterlife. Aside from biological males being supplied with weapons, the grave goods say little about the occupations of the two sexes. Evidently, both men and women spun thread. This population may be understood as migrants from South Arabia to Oman on the strength of an oral historical account (Arab. kashf al-ghumma), written down centuries after the fact. However, the Kashf contains no real information, aside from a vague plot of Persian dominance and 'Omani' independence. Another reason to believe in a newly arrived population is the contrast of the Late Iron Age material culture with that of the indigenous Early Iron Age population. The Late Iron Age differs in terms of pottery from that distributed in central Oman and in the neighbouring present-day United Arab Emirates. Significantly, razors occur in the Early Iron Age contexts, but not in the succeeding ones. The traditional explanation of a diaspora '2000 years before the coming of Islam ‚Äí after God had Sab øƒÅ æ flooded', is apocryphal.N≈´r ad-dƒ´n  øAbdullƒÅh b. ·∏§umayd al-SƒÅlimƒ´, Tu·∏•fat al-a øyƒÅn bi Sƒ´rat ahl  øUmƒÅn, Cairo 1347‚Äí1350, 20. Evidence appears in absolute terms from c. 100 BCE to c. 300 CE to date the relative chronological Samad Late Iron Age. Given the relative small amount of research, it is not possible to prove the transition from the Early Iron Age in absolute terms, which is often considered to end around 300 BCE. Based on several defective radiocarbon assays, in 2009 Yule rejected his low chronology published in the final report of 2001. Little evidence exists for a social or artefactual chronological development within this period, aside from a seriation of the finds from men's graves. Other artefact assemblages exist parallel to it both in Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The end of the Samad Period is even more obscure than its beginning. A series of megadroughts begin around 500 AD in Arabia,Dominik Fleitmann, Megadroughts at the dawn of Islam recorded in a stalagmite from Oman, Lecture 1.11.2011, AGU Fall Meeting. some 200 years after its disappearance. The Samad Late Iron Age is little researched, based mainly on one excavation report of over 250 graves at the type-site, notwithstanding later re-interpretations.J√ºrgen Schreiber, Transformationsprozesse in Oasensiedlungen Omans. Die vorislamische Zeit am Beispiel von Izki, Nizwa und dem Jebel Akhdar. dissertation, Munich 2007, URL http://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7548/1/Schreiber_Juergen.pdf.

Criticisms of the Samad Late Iron Age are notoriously unreliable, and show a disinterest in find-quantification. New research may easily change the chronology, area of distribution and other basic aspects. On present knowledge, it is easy to question the integrity of the definition of the Samad artefactual assemblage. In 2016 (Paul YulePaul Yule & Christine Pariselle , Silver phiale said to be from al-Juba (al-Wus·π≠a governorate) ‚Äí an archaeological puzzle, Arabian Archaeol. Epigraphy 27, 2016, 153‚Äí65) the definition of this assemblage was re-focussed on the finds from Samd and al-Maysar which reduced to area of distribution to some 14.000 km2, north to Muscat, south to Mu·∏çmar East near Adam, east to ·π¨ƒ´wƒ´, west to Mu·∏çmar. The Samad Late Iron Age is rarely commented on. Several mentions regarding the archaeology of Central Oman depart from the vantage point of the archaeology of the neighbouring United Arab Emirates. D. KennetOn the eve of Islam, archaeological evidence from eastern Arabia, Antiquity, 79, 2005, 114‚Äí11; idem, The decline of eastern Arabia in the Sasanian period, Arabian Archaeology Epigraphy 18, 2007, 86‚Äì122 simply links his excavation at Kush (U.A.E.) with sites on Ba·∏•rain and P√©riode pr√©islamique recent sites,(PIR, main source: M. Mouton, La p√©ninsule d‚ÄôOman de la fin de l‚Äô√¢ge du fer au d√©but de la p√©riode sasanide (250 av. ‚Äì 350 ap. JC), BAR International Series 1776, (printed 2008) to represent all of eastern Arabia from the 3rd cent. BCE to the 8th cent. CE, despite the lack of similarity to Central Oman's LIA characteristics. The increase in the documentation of the Samad assemblage makes this view obsolete. Decades after several European historians declared Oman to be a colony of Persia, perhaps during the 6th century BCE, the appearance of the Samad Late Iron Age assemblage and the so-called pre-Islamic recent periodMichel Mouton, La p√©ninsule d‚ÄôOman de la fin de l‚Äô√¢ge du fer au d√©but de la p√©riode sasanide (250 av. ‚Äì 350 ap. JC), BAR International Series 1776, 1992 (printed 2008). now are proven at over 80 sites, in contrast to a lack of sites with Persian finds in south-eastern Arabia. Today we have more sophisticated historical models for south-eastern Arabia than simply as an ancient Persian colony over the centuries, which in light of archaeological finds is implausible. In this issue, in the later 1st millennium BCE the ancient weak economic base and small population in Central Oman would have made Central Oman unattractive for an ancient colonial power. Central Oman's main importance seems to have been a strategic one for foreign powers interested in securing their own sea trade and interdicting that of competitors. By means of the use of linguistics it is possible to get past the limits of the archaeological record and learn something about who the people are who used the artefacts. The Samad sites lie outside the sphere of Arabic language subsequently at the time of the Prophet,Peter Behnstedt and Manfred Woidich, Arabische Dialektgeographie eine Einf√ºhrung, Brill, Leiden, page 27 Karte 1, . but inside the areas where so-called Modern South Arabian languages are spoken.Marie-Claude Simeone-Sennelle, Modern South Arabian, in: Stefan Weniger (ed.), The Semitic Languages, De Gruyter: Berlin, page 1078 fig. 64.1, . Recently, however, several Hasaitic inscriptions of north Arabian type have come to light in the United Arab Emirates and at other sites further north.B. Overlaet, P. Stein, M. Macdonald, An Aramaic-Hasaitic bilingual inscription from a monumental tomb at Mleiha, Sharjah, UAE, Arab. Archaeol. Epigraphy 27, 2016, pages 127-142. The Samad graves and grave goods do not relate to those from contemporary central or south-western Arabia, from whence this population usually is considered to derive. To explain this, we must assume a change from the original material culture of the immigrants to the Samad assemblage as we know it, which perhaps took a couple of generations. The graves and grave goods relate poorly with those of the PIR, with the exception of the shared balsamaria vessels. The burial custom shows weak evidence in the graves for a monogamous core family structure, perhaps like that of the Mahra tribes.Walter M√ºller, Mahra, Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. 6, Leiden, 1991, page 83. In one grave an older couple are buried. There are no burials with one male and more than one female.

The civilian occupying authorities with the Quisling regime and the German Wehrmacht operated a number of camps in Norway, including around 110 prison camps.Sergej ble ¬´skutt under flukt¬ª i Finnmark [Sergej was \\"shot during escape\\" in Finnmark] The Wehrmacht camps were largely POW camps and were scattered throughout the country. Some of these had extremely high mortality rates, owing to inhumane conditions and brutality. Both established and improvised jails and prisons throughout the country were also used for internment by the Nazi authorities. In particular the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst, headquartered at Victoria Terrasse, were notorious for torture and abuse of prisoners. Also, Arkivet in Kristiansand and Bandeklosteret in Trondheim became synonymous with torture and abuse. Some distinction was made between camps and prisons run by Norwegian Nazis and those run by German Nazi organizations, though it is safe to say that all atrocities took place under the authority of a unified command. The designated concentration camps were not classified as \\"KZ-Lager\\" by the Nazis, but rather as H√§ftingslager (\\"detainee camps\\") under the administration of the Nazi \\"security police,\\" the SS and Gestapo. The Nazi authorities deported over 700 Jews from Norway to Auschwitz, over 500 Nacht und Nebel prisoners to Natzweiler; and thousands more to Sachsenhausen, Ravensbr√ºck and other prisons and camps in Germany. Most of these were kept in Norwegian camps during transit. Although abuse, torture, and murder were commonplace in these camps, none of them were designated or functioned as extermination camps, nor did they reach the scale seen in camps in Germany, occupied Poland, and Austria. It is estimated that between 38,000 and 40,000 individuals passed through this camp system, for a total of 60,000 prisoner years. The camps served varying purposes, including: * internment of political prisoners, especially socialists and communists, but also religious dissenters. * internment of prisoners of war (Stammlager / Stalag) - especially Soviet and Yugoslavian soldiers * internment of so-called \\"bomb hostages\\" (Geisellager) - prominent Norwegians who would be executed in the event of the resistance movement bombing Nazi targets * transit internment of various prisoners bound for camps in Germany and Poland (Durchgangslager / Dulag) - including Jews, prominent political prisoners, and others. The Nazi authorities destroyed most of the records related to the camps and prisons they ran during the occupation. Effectively every local prison was used for these purposes by the Nazis, but several full-fledged camps were also established.

Longman & Co.) Montezuma's Daughter, first published in 1893, is a novel written by the Victorian adventure writer H. Rider Haggard. Narrated in the first person by Thomas Wingfield, an Englishman whose adventures include having his mother murdered, a brush with the Spanish Inquisition, shipwreck, and slavery. Eventually, Thomas unwillingly joins a Spanish expedition to New Spain, and the novel tells the fictionalized story of the first interactions between the natives and European explorers. This includes a number of misunderstandings, prejudice on the part of the Spaniards, and ultimately open war. During the course of the story, Thomas meets and marries the daughter of the native king (from whom the novel takes its title) and settles into life in Mexico. The war destroys his native family, and eventually Thomas gets revenge on the antagonist and returns to England. While in Mexico in 1891 researching for the book Haggard received news that his only son had died, which dealt him a lasting blow and badly affected his health. Haggard himself recognised that Montezuma's Daughter was the last of his best work \\"for the rest was repetition so far as fiction was concerned\\". Like many Victorian adventure novels, this one sometimes treats the natives as na√Øve and barbaric, a flaw Haggard explicitly points out in his main character.

History Las Positas College began as an extension program of Chabot College in 1963, offering 24 classes and enrolling 810 students at three sites, including Livermore High School. By 1965, the program had expanded to Granada High School in Livermore and subsequently offered classes at Amador and Dublin High Schools as well. The Chabot-Las Positas Community College District purchased the Livermore site that same year, intending to develop a comprehensive community college. However, in 1970 and again in 1972, bond issues to build the rural college failed despite Tri-Valley voters' overwhelming support, ostensibly because of opposition among the District's largest voting population, who lived outside the service area for the proposed college. Lacking funds to develop a second comprehensive community college, the Board of Trustees voted to develop a small education center at the Livermore site. On March 31, 1975, \\"Valley Campus\\" opened as the Livermore Education Center of Chabot College. Las Positas College has since developed into a fully accredited comprehensive institution. In 1988, LPC was designated by the Board of Governors to be an independent college. It received full accreditation on January 7, 1991 from the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In December 2013, the Chabot-Las Positas Community College District trustees appointed Barry A. Russell as the sixth president of the college. Russell worked in the office of the chancellor at California Community Colleges at the time of his appointment to president. Academics Las Positas College enrolls approximately 10,000-day and evening students. It offers a two-year curriculum for students seeking career preparation, transfer to a four-year college or university, or personal enrichment. LPC offers a guaranteed transfer agreement with all University of California schools except UC Berkeley and UCLA. Students who come to the LPC can choose any of 22 occupational associate degrees, 16 transfer associate degrees, and 42 certificate programs. The college has a competitive public speaking team, the Talk Hawks. In 2009 the Las Positas Talk Hawks were ranked as the number one community college, and number two college overall at the International Forensics Association Championship held in Montreal, Canada.  Athletics  The school's Ultimate Frisbee team won the College D-III national championship in 2006. In Fall semester 2015, LPC began its first season of intercollegiate Men's and Women's Water Polo.

It was founded in 1917 after the Russian revolution and with Russia's withdrawal imminent. The council served as a forum for preliminary discussions of potential armistice terms as well as peace treaty settlement conditions, and it was succeeded by the Conference of Ambassadors. Formation British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had grave concerns regarding the strategy of Sir William Robertson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander in Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, in response to the Allied losses at the Somme and at Battle of Passchendaele. Following the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, in which the Germans and Austro- Hungarians surprised the Italian forces, Lloyd George proposed the formation of the Supreme War Council at the Rapallo Conference of 5‚Äì7 November 1917. Japan and Russia were not to be included, and the Italians and French, worried that Salonika might be evacuated, wanted it confined to the Western Front.Woodward, 1998, pp191-2 =Permanent Military Representatives= Each Allied nation would also appoint a senior military officer as Permanent Military Representative. The French PMR was Ferdinand Foch, later replaced by Maxime Weygand and Joseph Joffre. The British were represented by Sir Henry Hughes Wilson. Italy was represented by Luigi Cadorna. The USA, which was \\"Associated\\" with the Allies, was not involved with the political structures, but sent a Permanent Military Representative, Tasker H. Bliss.Woodward, 1998, pp191-2 Wilson and his staff conducted numerous research projects into offensives against Turkey, culminating in the \\"Joint Note 12\\".Woodward, 1998, pp194-5 At the Supreme War Council (30 January ‚Äì 1 February) Hankey recorded that the national Commanders-in-Chief, national Chiefs of Staff and PMRs \\"all gave different advice\\" creating \\"a worse state of chaos than I have ever known in all my wide experience\\". Lloyd George, whose main goal was to thwart Robertson, blocked a suggestion by Foch (French Chief of Staff) that the proposed Allied Reserve be controlled by the national Chiefs of Staff, possibly prompted by the notes Wilson was passing him across the table. It was eventually agreed that Foch should command the Reserve, with Wilson as his deputy.Woodward, 1998, pp197 The Allied Reserve eventually slipped from the agenda as the Commanders-in-Chief, Haig and P√©tain refused to hand over sufficient troops. Early in 1918 Wilson replaced Robertson as CIGS and at the end of March Foch became Allied Generalissimo. After April 1918 all Allied troops on the Western Front were placed under the command of the , a multi- national general staff that developed from the Supreme War Council. The was on similar lines to the and came under General Ferdinand Foch, who had overall command of all Allied troops. Without its two main personalities the military machinery at Versailles became less important. Meetings Although the military council sat at least once a week (90 meetings took place between November 1917 and November 1919), formal Interallied Conferences with civilian heads of state took place ten times during the lifespan of the Supreme War Council (SWC). Those meetings are listed below.The Supreme War Council, pgs. 36 & 37 =Wartime Meetings= 7 November 1917 At this meeting, the formation of the Supreme War Council was approved by the Allied war leaders in the town of Rapallo, Italy (close to the French border). The idea was thought up by the British, and approved at a British War Cabinet meeting on 2 November 1917.National Archives, CAB 23-4, pgs. 298-300 of 579 29 Nov to 3 Dec 1917 The first Interallied Conference in France took place in Paris at the Quai d'Orsay. This was the first appearance of Prime Minister Clemenceau, who took office on 14 November 1917. 30 Jan to 2 Feb 1918 The third SWC Interallied Conference was held at Versailles, just outside Paris. It was here that an Allied General Reserve was approved, consisting of 14 French, 9 British, and 7 Italian divisions. It was to be under the control of the SWC military chiefs, who, it was thought, would be in the best position to allocate manpower to the front in the event of a German attack. Between the third and fourth SWC meetings, resistance to the General Reserve by British General William Robertson caused him to be replaced. In early March, it was found that his subordinate, B.E.F. Commander Douglas Haig, also refused to follow the SWC order. With help from his allies General Petain and Prime Minister Clemenceau, who also opposed the measure, the advocates of the General Reserve were sidestepped. With a massive attack from Germany thought to be imminent, it was decided that it was too late to replace Haig and to follow through with the plan. 14‚Äì16 March 1918 The fourth SWC Interallied Conference was held in London. Here, the General Reserve plan was cancelled. It was thought it would take three months to reposition divisions for the Reserve, when, in fact, the German attack was just 8 days away. The Council also put out an official statement about the Brest-Litovsk \\"peace\\" treaty made between Germany and Russia.Supreme War Council, pgs. 40 & 41 1‚Äì2 May 1918 The fifth SWC Conference was held in Versailles and Abbeville, France. The matter of American troops was discussed. A separate agreement made in late January between the United States and England provided that America would supply six complete divisions to France, transported in British ships, and trained by the British Army.National Archives, CAB 23-5, pg. 194 of 475, minute 6 Due to Operation Michael, the German attack on March 21, 1918, and the need for battlefield replacements, the SWC military generals issued Joint Note# 18, which asked that the United States only send infantry and machine gun units to France. General Pershing agreed to the arrangement, but wanted to take it one month at a time. Prime Minister Clemenceau drafted the final agreement, which extended the plan for two months. In Abbeville, the matter of a B.E.F. embarkment from the Channel Ports to England was taken up. In a time of crisis, should the B.E.F. have a policy of moving south and linking up with the French, or have a fighting withdrawal to the ports, where prepositioned shipping would be waiting to transport them back to England? It was known that both General Haig, and his superior, General Henry Wilson, favored an embarkation plan. The matter was discussed in secret by the military generals, before the official conference started, at the Prefect's House. Marshal Foch would have no part of it. When asked, he repeatedly answered, \\"Ne lachez pas pied\\" (Don't let go).David Lloyd George, \\"War Memoirs, Vol. VI\\", pgs. 41 & 42 3‚Äì4 June 1918 The sixth SWC Conference took place in Versailles. Here, the United States was asked for more reinforcements. Other issues discussed were amalgamation (the integration of US troops with the B.E.F.), and the pooling of allied supplies. Allied pessimism prevailed at this meeting. The English, French and Italian Prime Ministers signed a letter to President Wilson that said, \\"there is a great danger of the war being lost ... owing to the allied reserves being exhausted before those of the enemy\\", and that the United States would have to raise 100 divisions, requiring the call up of 300,000 conscripts a month, to raise an army of 4 million men.Pershing, My Experiences in the World War, Vol. II, pg. 80 General Pershing also cabled Washington D.C., saying, \\"It should be most fully realized at home that the time has come for us to take up the brunt of the war and that France and England are not going to be able to keep their armies at present strength very much longer.\\"Ibid, pg. 82 Also, \\"If the Allies had seen this a year or even six months earlier and had given us assistance in shipping\\"...\\"they could have assisted in the formation of a powerful American Army\\". Instead, \\"the number of training infantrymen in America will be practically exhausted by the middle of July, they [the allies] still insisted on a program of infantry personnel\\", and, \\"The Prime Ministers and General Foch appeal most urgently for trained or even untrained men.\\" In his memoirs, Pershing says about raising the army, \\"In its execution as a whole, the achievement stands out as a lasting monument to our War Department, marred only by the lack of foresight that made it necessary to send over untrained men and units in precipitate haste.\\"Ibid, pg. 84 Originally planned for an army of 500,000 men, the draft had to be expanded five times before a 4 million man army could be raised. 2‚Äì5 July 1918 The seventh SWC Conference, held at Versailles, was attended by British Dominion Prime Ministers from Canada, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. 30 Oct to 10 Nov 1918 The eighth, and longest SWC Conference took place in Versailles. Here, the Armistice terms were drafted for the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, and Germany.Supreme War Council, pgs. 47-57 =Peacetime Meetings= During the Paris Peace Negotiations, which took place from January to June 1919, the Supreme War Council became the \\"Council of Ten\\", and later the \\"Council of Four\\", as President Wilson and Prime Ministers Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and Orlando did most of the work constructing the Treaty of Versailles. 14‚Äì16 January 1920 in Paris, France This meeting was held four days after the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. Lloyd George proposed dropping the blockade of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic by starting negotiations with the \\"Russian people\\" in the form of the centrosoyuz, which at that time was not controlled by the Bolsheviks. This was agreed, with a communique from the Council being published on 16 January. In the event, the negotiations soon became simply between the United Kingdom and a bolshevised centrosoyuz, leading to the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement. 6‚Äì16 July 1920 in Spa, Belgium This was attended by German delegates to discuss war reparations.

He was 'surprised and amazed' at how the treatment pinpointed 'with precision and remarkable accuracy the deep, debilitating and demoralizing troubles that have afflicted [him] for so long', something he related to 'the \\"exteriorization\\" of \\"latent cruelty\\" causing the \\"organic disorder\\" (OC 4: 33) in plague-victims'.  Themes  Artaud intended his work as an attack on theatrical convention and the importance of language of drama, opposing the vitality of the viewer's sensual experience against theatre as a contrived literary form, and urgency of expression against complacency on the part of the audience. In No More Masterpieces, Artaud attacks what he believed to be the elitism of an irrelevant, outdated literary/theatrical canon. Artaud expressed the importance of recovering \\"the notion of a kind of unique language half-way between gesture and thought\\".  English translation & influence  The first English edition of The Theatre and Its Double was translated by M.C. Richards and published by Grove Press in 1958. Richards encountered Artaud's name in Jean-Louis Barrault's memoir Reflections on the Theatre (1951).:35 Prior to beginning the translation, Richards had collaborated in a close reading of the text with John Cage and David Tudor at Black Mountain College. Cage credited this close reading as the impetus for Theater Piece No.1, a 1951 performance art event regarded as the first Happening. Participants included Robert Rauschenberg, Charles Olson, David Tudor and Merce Cunningham. Afterwards, Tudor encouraged Richards to begin translating the text. Richards' translation introduced Artaud to the avant-garde scene in America, and is still considered to be the definitive English translation of the text. It is still read, and strongly influenced the directing philosophies of such renowned avant-garde and contemporary groups and figures as Peter Brook, The Living Theatre, The Open Theatre and La Mama's Great Jones Repertory Company, most notably in their production of The Trojan Women directed by Andrei Serban and composed by Elizabeth Swados.

He played on the 1884 Providence Grays team which won the first interleague series to decide the world champions of baseball. Irwin then served as a major league manager for several years. Irwin occupied numerous baseball roles in the latter years of his career, having spent time as a college baseball coach, a major league scout and business manager, a minor league owner and manager, and a National League umpire. For most of Irwin's career, the collegiate and professional baseball schedules allowed him to hold positions at both levels in the same year. Irwin also produced several innovations which impacted sports. He took the field with the first baseball fielder's glove, invented a type of football scoreboard, promoted motor-paced cycling tracks and ran a short-lived professional soccer league. Irwin became terminally ill with cancer in the last weeks of his life. Shortly after his death from an apparent suicide, Irwin made headlines when it was discovered that two wives and families survived him in separate cities. He had been married to one woman since the 1880s and to the other since the 1890s. He was posthumously elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989. Early life Arthur Irwin was born in 1858 in Toronto, Ontario, to an Irish blacksmith and a Canadian mother. As a child, he moved with his family to Boston and attended school there. He played local amateur baseball from 1873 until he was recruited by the Worcester Ruby Legs of the National Association in 1879. In late 1879, manager Frank Bancroft took Irwin and most of the other Worcester players on a baseball tour which included visits to New Orleans and Cuba. The team, which traveled under the name of the Hop Bitters, returned to the United States after only a few days due to financial and contractual difficulties. The team may have played as few as two games in Cuba. Baseball career =Playing days= Irwin's major league career began when the Ruby Legs moved into the National League (NL) in 1880. He led the league in assists in his rookie season, and remained with the team through 1882, when it folded due to poor attendance. Irwin next spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not get along well, and Sweeney left the team in the middle of the season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885. Irwin moved on to the newly formed Philadelphia Quakers in 1886. Tragedy struck the Philadelphia squad in 1888 when pitcher Charlie Ferguson developed typhoid fever, dying at Irwin's home. During the 1889 season, Irwin went to the Washington Nationals for his first opportunity as player-manager, although the team folded at the end of the season. He next played for the Boston Reds in the Players' League in 1890. That same year, Irwin coached the baseball team at Dartmouth College. While Irwin served as a player-manager for Boston in 1890, he was able to focus on the managerial role for the team in 1891. That year the team signed his brother, John Irwin, on May 21. Newspapers brought accusations of nepotism and criticized John's mediocre play. John Irwin was released by Boston on July 16, and his major league playing career was over by the next month. Although Irwin's regular playing career ended after the 1890 season, he appeared in six games while managing the Boston team after it moved to the American Association in 1891. He also played in one game while managing the 1894 Philadelphia Phillies. A left-handed hitter, Irwin finished his playing career with 1,015 games played and batted .241 in 4,190 plate appearances. He tallied 396 runs batted in and 552 runs scored. Stolen bases were not awarded until 1886, but Irwin tallied 93 stolen bases in his last 532 games. He recorded an .878 career fielding percentage, committing 647 errors in 5,317 fielding chances. Irwin played 947 games at shortstop and 56 games at third base. He also appeared at second base, pitcher and catcher. =Early non-playing roles= Irwin coached at the University of Pennsylvania between 1893 and 1895, and managed the Philadelphia major league club during those last two seasons. In 1894, he angered Penn supporters when a talented first baseman named Goeckle nearly signed with Irwin's major league team just prior to a series of collegiate championship games. Nonetheless, by 1895, Irwin's coaching role at Penn included the selection of players and other duties that traditionally fell to the team captain. Irwin left Philadelphia in 1896 to manage the New York Giants. Relieved of his duties after one season in New York, he was subsequently recruited to manage in Milwaukee. However, he returned to coach the minor league team in his native Toronto instead. Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced arrest on a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from comments made by Irwin about the actions of the Philadelphia ownership during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded some of his best players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring stretch in 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came with the end of the 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to manage that team for a couple of seasons. By 1906, Irwin was manager of the Altoona Mountaineers in the Tri-State League. In July 1907, Irwin resigned as manager of the Mountaineers after fans became disgruntled. Even after entering baseball scouting, Irwin briefly managed the 1908 Washington club in the short-lived Union Professional League. The league was plagued by financial problems‚Äîincluding the inability to pay players at times‚Äîand it folded less than two months after play began. He was rehired to the Penn coaching staff in 1908. =Scouting= Irwin (left) with Mr. and Mrs. Frank Chance, 1913 In the summer of 1907, Irwin became a scout for the New York Highlanders. In 1909, New York manager George Stallings rented an apartment overlooking Hilltop Park and sent Irwin up to steal signs from the opposing team. Using a system of binoculars and mirrors, Irwin read the signs and flashed them back to Stallings so they could be relayed to the batter. By 1912, almost the entire Highlanders roster had been scouted by Irwin. In a newspaper interview covering his scouting career, Irwin asserted that he preferred signing young prospects over expensive stars. \\"The chances are better with a young player, for by getting him early you can gradually break him into the style of play the team is using\\", he said. In December 1912, New York president Frank J. Farrell promoted Irwin from scout to business manager. Upon his promotion, a statement from the team said, \\"He has been of such service to the club in numerous ways that Mr. Farrell has invested him with full power to look after business details in future.\\" The poor relationship between Irwin and New York manager Frank Chance was a factor in the manager's 1914 resignation after two years of a three-year contract. The New York Times said that Chance \\"did not think it was possible to collect so many mediocre players on one major league club.\\" Irwin remained with the Highlanders until Farrell sold the team to Jacob Ruppert and T.L. Huston. Upon the sale of the team, Irwin and several other Highlanders personnel submitted their resignations. =Later coaching career= Irwin became part-owner of the Lewiston Cupids in 1915 and managed that club in the final season of the original New England League. The 1915 Cupids featured 16-year-old Cuban pitcher Oscar Tuero, who won 17 games in his third professional season. The team did not win the pennant that year, but the race came down to the final days of the season. Irwin and Christy Mathewson were considered for a coaching position at Harvard College that year, but former Highlanders catcher and professional scout Fred Mitchell was ultimately selected. In 1916, Irwin publicly accused Philadelphia's Connie Mack of underhanded dealings in obtaining third baseman Jim Ritter from Baltimore. He said that Mack convinced the New England League's Baltimore club to draft Ritter so that Mack could later obtain him cheaply. Mack was outraged at the accusations and immediately severed all connections with the player. Ritter never appeared in a major league game. Irwin managed the Rochester Hustlers between 1918 and 1920. Rochester was not successful under Irwin; the 1920 Hustlers finished with 45 wins and 106 losses. Cray L. Remington of the Rochester Evening Journal later wrote, \\"Local fans used to pan Arthur Irwin in the old days when Arthur was as innocent of wrong as the little sparrows on the limbs. Arthur's job was to win ball games minus talent. He couldn't do it.\\" While managing the Eastern League's Hartford Senators in 1921 against a New York semi-pro team, Irwin noticed the play of Lou Gehrig and convinced him to sign his first professional contract with Hartford. Gehrig had already committed to play at Columbia University and professional experience would affect his collegiate eligibility, so he began playing for Hartford using assumed names like Lou Lewis. However, Columbia found out about Gehrig's play and the slugger was forced to sit out of college baseball for a year. Sports innovations right While playing with Providence in 1883, Irwin broke the third and fourth fingers of his left hand. Not wanting to miss any games, he obtained an oversized buckskin driving glove, padded it and sewed the third and fourth fingers together to allow space for bandages. He used the glove even after his fingers healed. John Montgomery Ward of New York soon took the field with a similar glove. By the following season, almost every professional player was using the \\"Irwin glove.\\" Prior to 1884, use of gloves was limited to first basemen and catchers. In 1882, Irwin committed a league-high 78 errors in 84 games. He committed 66 errors in 98 games the following year. Over his next two seasons with the glove, Irwin committed 98 errors in 163 games. Irwin was president of the American League of Professional Football (ALPF) for its lone season in 1894. The organization represented the first American professional soccer league. Teams in the league were named after their MLB counterparts in the same cities. Some of the active baseball managers served as coaches for the soccer teams, and fans were sometimes enticed by the rumor of MLB players who might participate in the league. Irwin was also involved in an attempt to popularize roller polo. Irwin developed and patented a football scoreboard, which was in use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured at each end of the field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds. Other influence Irwin owned athletic facilities in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and negotiated with baseball officials about bringing organized baseball there in 1900. Irwin opened a motor-paced bicycle racing track in the city in July 1902. His focus on the bicycle track enterprise had been a factor in his resignation from the Penn coaching staff in 1902. He also became involved with the Hartford Avenue Colosseum Company and oversaw its Philadelphia bicycle track. Death On June 21, 1921, Irwin gave up his managerial role with the Hartford club in the Eastern League due to health concerns. He was experiencing abdominal trouble and severe nervous attacks. Irwin was diagnosed with stomach cancer; he had lost 60 pounds in two weeks. While in the hospital, he was told that he only had a few days to live. While traveling from New York City to Boston on the vessel Calvin Austin, Irwin was lost overboard in an apparent suicide on July 16. Shortly after his death, a theory emerged that Irwin had been robbed for $5,000 and then murdered aboard the ship. This theory was discounted when it was learned from family members that Irwin had taken only $35 on the trip. When Irwin was last seen aboard the ship around midnight on July 16, he told a friend that he was \\"coming home to his brother John's to die.\\" During the investigation into Irwin's disappearance and death, two widows emerged; one lived in Boston and the other lived in New York. He first married Elizabeth, the woman in Boston, in 1883. Together they had three children, including a son who was 37 at the time of Irwin's death, and nine grandchildren. In the 1890s he married again, this time in Philadelphia to May, a woman he met while coaching baseball at the University of Pennsylvania. They settled in New York and had a son who was 24 when Irwin died. In his final days, Irwin sold his rights from his scoreboard business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow was surprised at the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York for more than a few days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death. In 1989, Irwin was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

Products 1992 Utilimaster (UMC) Aeromate In the 1980s and 1990s the company manufactured the aerodynamic Aeromate on an in-house, front-wheel drive chassis. The original model was introduced in August 1988 and used Chrysler's 2.5-liter inline-four engine known from the K-car. Later models used either the turbocharged version of Chrysler's 2.5-litre four or their 3.3-litre V6 engine, with the V6 being introduced for the 1991 model year. With a GVWR the vehicle's payload was with either engine fitted. In mid-1990, for the 1991 model year, Utilimaster introduced the larger Aeromaster Z2000. Also sitting on a proprietary front-wheel drive chassis, this aerodynamic walk-in van was available in GVWRs from and was offered with either Ford gasoline V8 engines or Cummins' 4BT four-cylinder diesel. Isuzu Reach in FedEx livery In 2011, Isuzu and Utilimaster announced plans for Utilimaster to assemble the Isuzu Reach in their Wakarusa, Indiana, plant. It is a commercial step van with much better aerodynamics and a more fuel-efficient engine than other walk-in vans in the class, offering markedly better fuel efficiency. On February 14, 2012, Utilimaster announced it would move from Wakarusa, Indiana, to nearby Bristol, Indiana.

History Dan Iliescu (2008) Timpuri Noi was formed in 1980, and remained an underground act up until 1991. This was mainly due to what was perceived as \\"subversive lyrical content\\" in the Ceau≈üescu era. Incidentally, the name derives from a clich√© of the period: its literal meaning is \\"New Times\\" (in the sense of \\"New Age\\"), used to signify Marxist Socialism. The tongue-in-cheek reference is somehow associated with the Bucharest metro station of the same name (see: Timpuri Noi). The name is also the Romanian translation of Modern Times, the title for Charles Chaplin's classic 1936 film. In the early nineties, up to around 1995, the band was arguably the top Romanian act. Around the time, they had the opportunity to be the opening act for rather prestigious (albeit musically different) foreign acts during concerts in Bucharest: Ian Gillan and Uriah Heep in 1992, Scorpions in 1993, Saxon, Paradise Lost and Jethro Tull in 1994, Iron Maiden and Kreator in 1995, Eros Ramazzotti, Joe Cocker and Rod Stewart later in the same year. 1994 also signified an important event in both Timpuri Noi's career and Romanian music in general: Timpuri Noi gives the very first unplugged performance in this country, recorded as an album in the same year (see below).

Situated on the eastern shore of the Kallang Basin, the Kallang Airport spanned the modern planning areas of Kallang and Geylang at its greatest extent. The conserved complex, including the airport's terminal building, is located wholly within Kallang. Boasting an anchorage area for seaplanes along the airport's perimeter on the Kallang Basin, the Kallang Airport was hailed as \\"the finest airport in the British Empire\\" at that time. Famous aviator Amelia Earhart once described it as \\"an aviation miracle of the East\\". Construction of the Kallang Airport began in 1931 with 300 acres of mangrove swampland being reclaimed. It resulted in the displacement of a large Malay community to the area around Jalan Eunos. Three Hawker Osprey aircraft first touched down in the Kallang Airport around two years before its official opening, on 21 November 1935. During World War II, the Kallang Airport was the only operational airfield in Singapore capable of supporting Allied campaigns against the Japanese forces. It was during the Japanese occupation period that the airport's grass landing zone was upgraded into a concrete runway and extended to 5500 feet. As early as 1950, plans were made to build a new airport at Paya Lebar (the current Paya Lebar Air Base) as the Kallang Airport was unable to cope with the increase in air traffic despite being expanded. The Kallang Airport finally closed in 1955. The Kallang Airport compound was subsequently occupied by several organisations following its decommissioning, the most notable being the People's Association which used the facility as its headquarters from 1960 to 2009. While most parts of the airport were demolished soon after its closure, numerous structures remain. The structures which were gazetted for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority on 5 December 2008 include the airport's terminal building, administrative blocks, aircraft hangars and control tower. The conserved complex is currently unoccupied. Other parts of the Kallang Airport were redeveloped. The area surrounding the airport's former runway was first converted into the Kallang Park, a large public park created as part of \\"Project Lung\\"; later, the old National Stadium was built on the same site; today, the Singapore Sports Hub (including the new National Stadium and Singapore Indoor Stadium) is a major national landmark. The eastern portion of the Kallang Airport was redeveloped into one of Singapore's first modern residential precinct, now called the \\"Old Kallang Airport Estate\\". It was one of the locations that hosted the 2011 Singapore Biennale art festival. There are plans to transform the Kallang Airport area into a commercial hub, along with the adjacent Kallang riverside. Today, roads like Old Airport Road, Kallang Airport Drive, Kallang Airport Way directly reference the Kallang Airport; Old Terminal Lane refers to the conserved Kallang Airport terminal building; Dakota Crescent, Dakota Close and Dakota MRT station are named after the Douglas DC-3 \\"Dakota\\" aircraft that used to land frequently at the Kallang Airport and serve to commemorate an aviation disaster in 1946. History and naming Kallang Airport got its name from the nearby Kallang Basin, which was named after a group of sea-gypsies living around the area in the 1800s. On 11 February 1930, the Dutch Airline KLM operated the first service flight between Amsterdam and Batavia (now Jakarta), landing in Seletar with a Dutch-made Fokker trimotor monoplane carrying 8 passengers and a cargo of fresh fruit, flowers and mail. This marked the beginning of commercial civil aviation in Singapore. KLM later introduced a regular Amsterdam to Batavia flight service in late 1931. Two years later, in July 1933, Imperial Airways, the flagship airline of the British empire at the time, started a service between London and Darwin via Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta, Singapore and Jakarta. This service was later extended to Brisbane and operated jointly with Qantas on 17 December 1934. Booming commercial aviation traffic led to congestion at the existing Seletar Airbase (today's Seletar Airport), creating a need for a new airport. On 31 August 1931, Sir Cecil Clementi, Governor of the Straits Settlements, announced that Kallang Basin as the location for the new civil aerodrome suitable for land planes and seaplanes, and relieving Seletar of commercial flight activities. This place was chosen over other possible sites because of its proximity to the city centre as well as its location next to the Kallang Basin, which allowed seaplanes to land. Construction Reclamation work began on the 103 hectares of a tidal swamp in Kallang Basin in 1932. Seven million cubic metres of earth were used for the filling of this tidal swamp. By 1936, all reclamation and consolidation of land were completed, forming a 915-metre diameter, dome-shaped landing ground. On 12 June 1937, the Kallang Aerodrome was officially opened by Sir Shenton Thomas, who had taken over the governorship of the Straits Settlements from Sir Cecil in 1934. At the time it was hailed as \\"the finest airport in the British Empire\\", with facilities that were considered revolutionary. The circular aerodrome allowed planes to land from any direction, and the slipway allowed seaplanes to be served at the same terminal building as regular planes. World War II When the Japanese launched their invasion of Malaya and Singapore on 8 December 1941, Kallang was the principal fighter airfield. By January 1942, it was the only operational fighter airfield in Singapore, as the other airfields (Tengah, Seletar and Sembawang) were within range of Japanese artillery at Johor Bahru. Brewster Buffalo fighters of 243 Squadron RAF, 488 Squadron RNZAF and a detachment of 2-VLG-V of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force operated from the airfield, defending Singapore from repeated Japanese air raids. They were joined later by Hawker Hurricanes of 232 Squadron RAF, but attrition took a steady toll on men and machines, and by the last days of January 1942, the airfield had been badly damaged by the bombing and only a small number of aircraft were serviceable. The last of the fighters left in early February, escaping to carry on the fight just before Singapore was surrendered to the advancing Japanese. Air Headquarters Malaya Communication Squadron RAF was formed here. The war years and after The growth in aviation traffic was stunted during the war years, a period which saw the landing circle being converted into a single runway to allow use by warplanes. The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and Qantas resumed their regular services to the airport, while the resurrected local airline Malayan Airways (MAL) began services on 1 May 1947. In the early 1950s, the increasing size of aircraft and the need for longer runways resulted in it being extended beyond Mountbatten Road in the eastern boundary of the facility into what is now Old Airport Road. The new runway was 5,496 feet long and 165 feet wide. This necessitated the installation of traffic lights to halt vehicular traffic every time a plane took off or landed.

Airlines and destinations (before closure) Accidents and incidents * On 7 November 1941, a Royal Air Force Tiger Moth piloted by Flight Lieutenant Alec Wills was hit from behind by a landing Buffalo of 243 Squadron, resulting in Wills' death. * On 29 June 1946, one of the Dakota aircraft belonging to the Royal Air Force Police with 20 NCOs on board crashed at the airport in a storm with no survivors. * On 13 March 1954, a BOAC Lockheed Constellation, G-ALAM Belfast carrying mail crashed while attempting to land at Kallang Airport en route to London from Sydney. The accident killed 32 people, including eight crew members. An investigation of the incident found that the most probable cause of the crash was pilot fatigue, but there was a serious problem of \\"inadequate response of the fire and rescue services\\". Legacy Kallang Airport has left several reminders of its existence. The old runway near to Mountbatten Road is now called Old Airport Road. The surrounding public flats there are named the Old Kallang Airport Estate. The estate is served by Dakota MRT station, which took its name from the Dakota DC-3 aircraft which used to land at the Kallang Airport. Two new roads near Kallang MRT station have been named \\"Kallang Airport Drive\\" and \\"Kallang Airport Way\\". In addition, Old Terminal Lane, which links Geylang Road with Kallang Airport Way, references the Kallang Airport's conserved terminal building. The slipway for seaplanes was occupied by the Oasis Building, a structure built on the Kallang Basin. The terminal building itself was used as the headquarters of the People's Association until 9 April 2009, when it moved to its new headquarters at King George's Avenue. The PA building held many activities for the ruling People's Action Party, ranging from school visits to social events. Kallang Airport was gazetted for conservation on 5 December 2008 by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore.  Architecture  The original Terminal Building is an iconic modernist building with Art Deco-style railings and columns by Frank Dorrington Ward. The international style also be interpreted in this building as a radical simplification of form, refusing of ornament, using transparent materials and making building visually lighter, also the clearly division of functions. There is a circular elevated glass control tower centrally and two side blocks that composed the former terminal building with an open-air viewing deck on the top floor. The People‚Äôs Association kept the concrete structure and transparent glazed walls and repaired the fa√ßade, closed the gates and rebuilt the window on the second floor to reorganize the interior space for office.

It also offers international membership. History The association was started in 1889 by a small group of museums to protect the interests of museums and galleries. Its inaugural meeting was held at the invitation of the Council of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society in York on 20 June 1889. The MA is the oldest museum association in the world. Mission The MA's mission is inspiring museums to change lives. It advocates for museums, sets ethical standards and runs training and professional development for members wishing to further their careers. Activities The association organises an annual conference. This is Europe's largest event for museum and heritage professionals. Members receive the monthly Museums Journal. The MA also produces Museum Practice online. The latest case studies and best practice by museum professionals around the UK, with an interactive platform for users to share their ideas. Through its work with the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, the MA has created the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund, building on its 2005 report, Collections for the Future. The MA charts the health of UK museums through its annual survey, Museums in the UK. In 2012 the MA began its \\"Museums 2020\\" project to create a vision for the future of the museum sector. It hopes to focus on the impacts that museums will have in the future on individuals, communities, society, and the environment. In 2013 the MA produced \\"Museums Change Lives\\", its campaigning vision for the future of museums. \\"Museums Change Lives\\" explores the impact of museums under three main headings: wellbeing, better places, ideas and people. The MA's Transformers scheme was piloted in 2014, then rolled out nationally. Transformers is for people in mid-career, supported by any accredited museum (or museum working towards accreditation), looking to change the way they work. Participants are challenged to develop new ways of thinking and supported throughout to engage with experimental ideas, fresh thinking and learning from the experience of experts and innovators. In 2018, the MA launched Collections 2030, a research project looking at the long-term purpose, use and management of museum collections. Membership The MA has over 8,000 individual members, 580 institutional members, and 250 corporate members. It runs a professional development scheme, with mentoring and regular training events. \\"AMA\\" denotes an Associate of the Museums Association. \\"FMA\\" denotes a Fellow of the Museums Association. Governance The MA is governed by a board of trustees, from all parts of the UK museum community, elected by members. In April 2018, Maggie Appleton replaced David Fleming as president; she is also the CEO of the RAF Museum. Previous presidents include David Anderson, David Fleming, Stuart Davies, Charles Saumarez Smith, Jane Glaister, Max Hebditch, Barbara Woroncow and Virginia Tandy.

She also played Paul Newman's romantic interest in The Secret War of Harry Frigg (1968). Early life She was born Silvija Ko≈°ƒáina () to a Greek father, who had a hotel in the \\"West Coast\\" section of Split, Dalmatia, and a Polish mother. During World War II, as a teenager, she moved to Italy to live with her sister, who had married an Italian citizen. After winning beauty contests as a teenager, she was offered modelling work. In 1954, while studying physics at the University of Naples, and living in a boarding school of nuns, she was asked to be Miss di Tappa (\\"Stage Miss\\"), who presents flowers to the winner of a stage of the 1954 Giro d'Italia bicycle race, then at Naples. She was convinced, but with difficulty because of her shyness, then a picture of her, kissing the winner, was published in newspapers all over Europe. Career Eduardo De Filippo noticed her and decided to cast her in a small role for the movie Questi fantasmi (1954) that was about to be filmed. This did not eventually happen, but it did lead to a small part, of an aspiring actress, alongside Tot√≤ in Are We Men or Corporals? (1955) by Camillo Mastrocinque, leading to her breakout role, portraying Giulia, daughter of the train engineer Andrea, in Pietro Germi's The Railroad Man (1956). Koscina returned in Guendalina (1957), playing the part of a young mother. A lead player in popular comedies, such as Nonna Sabella (Grandmother Sabella,1957), Ladro lui, ladra lei (He a thief, she a thief, 1958), and Poveri milionari (Poor millionaires, 1958), Koscina alternated cleverly between roles as vamp and ingenue. She represented women in search of social upward mobility, the image of an Italy that had left its worst problems behind. Koscina (left) with fellow Yugoslav actors Ljubi≈°a Samard≈æiƒá, Milena Draviƒá, and Bata ≈Ωivojinoviƒá at the Battle of Neretva premiere in Sarajevo in November 1969. Koscina was suited to sophisticated comedies like Mogli pericolose (Dangerous wives, 1958), where she made a direct sentimental challenge to poor Giorgia Moll. She played Hercules' fianc√©e in Le fatiche di Ercole (Hercules, 1958), a prototype of this kind of film. In Italy, a police officer let her go without issuing a traffic ticket. Later, as a guest on a television program, she thanked the policeman, thus getting him into trouble with the police department. The incident and its aftermath inspired the movie Il vigile (The Traffic Policeman, 1960), in which she played herself. In the first half of the 1960s, she married her lover, Raimondo Castelli, a small producer connected with Minerva Films. She managed to keep well afloat with roles in Damiano Damiani's ' (The Hired Killer, 1961). In La lepre e la tartaruga (The Tortoise and the Hare), an episode in Le quattro verita (The Three Fables of Love) (1963), the director Blasetti constructed a duel between Koscina and Monica Vitti. In 1965, Koscina appeared in Giulietta degli spiriti. She was also a television personality and often made special guest appearances on variety shows. She also co-starred in Jesus Franco's Marquis de Sade: Justine (1969), as well as Mario Bava's 1972 film Lisa and the Devil. From the early 1960s, she invested most of her considerable earnings in a luxurious villa, in the well-to-do district of Marino, Rome, complete with 16th-century furniture and artistic paintings. That lasted until her spending overcame her dwindling income, and she had to face a tax evasion inquest, when she was forced to sell her house in 1976. Living with Raimondo Castelli since 1960, they did not marry due to then Italian law and because his wife Marinella refused him an annulment. Castelli and Koscina married in Mexico in 1967, but that marriage was not recognized in Italy. (1929‚Äì2002) photographed Koscina for the American edition of Playboy in May 1967. After passing 30, she partnered with actors such as Kirk Douglas in A Lovely Way to Die (1968) and Paul Newman in The Secret War of Harry Frigg (1967), but without any luck. Her career was given a boost in the second half of the 1960s when she was photographed bare-breasted in the Italian edition of Playboy magazine. Mauro Bolognini's L'assoluto naturale (1969) was released, complete with a \\"chaste\\" full nude shot. She also starred in the 1967 comedy caper Three Bites of the Apple with David McCallum, and Deadlier Than the Male (1967), in which Elke Sommer and she portrayed sophisticated professional killers dueling with Bulldog Drummond. She also played Danica in the Yugoslavian movie The Battle of Neretva, in 1969. She played a German doctor, Bianca, in Hornets' Nest with Rock Hudson.

Nicola is most notable for authoring the Newburgh letter, which urged George Washington to assume a royal title. Born in Dublin, Ireland, Nicola had been an officer in the British Army, serving in Europe before immigrating to the Thirteen Colonies. Establishing a residence in Philadelphia with his family, Nicola opened a library in 1767 and was active in colonial philosophical organizations. As a result of his work to establish the American Philosophical Society, he was elected as one of its curators. When the American Revolution broke out, Nicola offered his services to the colonial government, which eventually appointed him to various positions with local forces. In 1777, Nicola proposed that the Continental Congress establish the Invalid Corps. The Congress accepted his proposal and appointed him as its commander. The Corps was stationed at various Pennsylvania locations before moving to West Point, New York. In 1782, after the end of most hostilities but before the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Nicola wrote the Newburgh letter, which was received coldly by Washington. Returning to civilian life, Nicola nevertheless was still active in military affairs, and was recalled to service during the 1790s, despite his advanced age. During this period, he continued to research for the American Philosophical Society, writing an especially controversial document entitled The Divinity of Jesus Christ Considered, From Scripture Evidences, in which he claimed that the divinity of Jesus Christ is not supported by scripture. He died in 1807, in the possession of only $55.  Early life and entry into the British Army  Very little is known of Nicola's early years. He was born in 1717 in Dublin, Ireland to a British Army officer. His grandparents were Huguenot refugees, and he was 511/512 French and 1/512 Italian by blood.Fowler, Jr (2011), Chapter 6 His parents provided him with a strong educational background and bought him a commission in January 1740. Later into that year, he married his first wife, Christiana Doyle, on September 19.Haggard (2002), p. 143 During the 1740s, Nicola was stationed in various Irish cities: Galway, Derry, Cork, among others. He was briefly stationed in Flanders in 1745 before he moved back to Charles Fort near Kinsale.  First decade in Pennsylvania  West side of the American Philosophical Society building in Philadelphia, PA. Doyle died in August 1759, and Nicola married his second wife, Jane Bishop, on April 18, 1760.Haggard (2002), p. 144 Their family decided to move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and they arrived August 1766. Upon the arrival Nicola started his own dry goods store.Bell (1983), p. 2 This did not work, and he eventually opened a library in September 1767. It started with nearly 200 to 300 volumes before expanding to over 1,000.Fredriksen (2006), p. 542 Throughout the next couple of years, Nicola moved the library to different spots before finally settling to Spruce Street and renaming it \\"General Circulating Library\\". With the help of his friend John Morgan, Nicola was admitted into the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge. By the following year, he became a part of the committee to help a merger with the American Philosophical Society. The merger was completed in November 1768, and Nicola was elected as one of the curators.Haggard (2002), pp. 144‚Äì145 At the start of the next year, Nicola decided to quit the dry food business for good and focus more on writing, stating \\"[Magazines were] the taste of the age, and found to possess many conveniences, such as gratifying the curiosity of the public, and serving as a repository for many small, though valuable pieces that would otherwise be lost to the world.\\" He began editing his new periodical, the American Magazine, or General Repository, and the first issue was published in January 1769.Haggard (2002), p. 145 This magazine, devoted to science, poetry, British and American news, folded in December after only nine issues. Nicola, however, continued to conduct research and write articles for the Society.  Re-entry into the Army and writing activities  Due to financial difficulties, Nicola and his family moved between various Pennsylvanian cities throughout the 1770s. Once the American Revolutionary War broke out, however, he realized that his military skills were probably most needed in Philadelphia. cited in Haggard (2002), p. 145 In July 1775, Nicola was hired by the Pennsylvania Council of Safety to inspect the local defenses in place along the banks of the Delaware River.Haggard (2002), p. 146 Since this was the only military position offered to him, in January 1776 Nicola opened a beer-selling shop. Shortly thereafter, he opened a school to help children in various disciplines of mathematics and engineering.Bell (1983), p. 3 This endeavor was short-lived, however, as the Pennsylvania Council of Safety gave him a second military position, this time as a barracks master. While attaining that position (which he was granted in February), Nicola composed and presented to the Council of Safety a \\"Plan of a Powder Magazine\\" and saw to the repair of the city jailhouse, for which he was reimbursed $226 by the Continental Congress. On December 2, 1776, Nicola was made Town Major of Pennsylvania.Morris (1978), p. 137It was at this time that he wrote one of the earliest American drill manuals ‚ÄúA Treatise for Military Exercise Calculated of the use of the Americans‚Äù published in 1776.  Tenure with the Invalid Corps  = Invalid Corps under Nicola in the early years = A painting of Fort Mifflin by Seth Eastman (1870) In March 1777, Nicola proposed to the Continental Congress the formation of an \\"Invalid Corps,\\" a group of men unfit for combat but still able to perform other military duties. In June, the Continental Congress accepted the proposal, appointing Nicola the commander of about 1,000 troops divided into eight companies of soldiers. The Invalid Corps was stationed in Philadelphia for most part of the Revolutionary War, but it was forced to move once General William Howe advanced into the city in 1777.Haggard (2002), p. 149 On September 25, 1777, the Invalid Corps retreated to Fort Mifflin.Haggard (2002), p. 150 Due to sickness, lack of clean water, and worries about British incursions, it was recommended to Nicola that he move the Corps to Trenton, New Jersey. Upon arriving at Trenton, Nicola moved to defend locals' property, seeing \\"a large vessel in the river [near Bordentown] with a very valuable Cargo belonging to Congress which was in danger of falling into the enemies hands\\", and taking thirty men to claim the cargo. Following its brief stay in Trenton, the Invalid Corps moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, as suggested by Richard Peters on September 29, 1777. However, instead of Allentown, the Corps was eventually stationed at Easton and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to assist in the management of hospitals and stores. Like the rest of the Continental Army, the Invalid Corps suffered harshly from the winter of 1777 to 1778. After a brief period in the camp of Valley Forge in the spring of 1778, the Invalid Corps moved back to their original quarters at Philadelphia, just after the British evacuated from it.Bell (1983), p. 4 cited in Haggard (2002), p. 151 = Service prior to 1782 = The Invalid Corps continued its many moves, including one from Pennsylvania to Boston. However, for the next three years, the Corps remained either in Philadelphia or the future Massachusetts capital.Haggard (2002), p. 151 During this three-year period, Nicola drew the \\"Plan of the English Lines near Philadelphia\\", which showed the locations of important fortifications from the Delaware River to Schuylkill River as well as other locations of British military facilities. Following the drawing of \\"Plan\\", Nicola submitted two papers where he obtained information from the British to Congress: \\"A Scheme for a Partisan Corps\\" and \\"Judicious remarks on a proposed reformation in the Army\\". Moreover, he strengthened the Corps by recruiting soldiers around Philadelphia. Nicola and the Invalid Corps were stationed at West Point, New York (pictured) and faced multiple difficulties while there. On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the Invalid Corps was given the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was difficult to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola wrote a letter to George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them.Haggard (2002), p. 152 Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the Invalid Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest.Haggard (2002), p. 153 Nicola sent letters about the situation to Washington, who wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. Washington, who did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter. Upon the arrival of the Invalid Corps at West Point, the charges were dropped, and Nicola was cleared of all charges. On August 4, 1781, Nicola complained to George Washington that the Corps would have great difficult during the winter time. Two months later on September 19, Nicola complained to General Horatio Gates about McDougall's lack of respect to the Corps.Haggard (2002), pp. 153‚Äì154 Eventually, Nicola proposed to Washington that the Invalid Corps should move back to Philadelphia; however, for various reasons, Washington denied it.Haggard (2002), p. 154 During the Corps' tenure at West Point, Nicola faced many challenges. Firstly, his troops did not act the way he wanted. In October 1777, Nicola sent out an arrest warrant for Sergeant Major Jonathan Guy for giving uniforms of the Continental Army to the British. The other example was in April 1778; Nicola stopped robberies done by members of the Corps in Easton. Secondly, Nicola was unable to fill the higher ranks because of the lack of qualifications from the men. In a letter to Washington, Nicola wrote that without men, he was unable to \\"keep the men under proper discipline\\". During court trials, Nicola had to borrow men from other units as the jury. The third problem was the lack of enlisted men for the Corps. The final problem was the poor financial situation that Nicola was in.Haggard (2002), p. 155 In a letter to the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time.Hazard (1853), p. 185 During that same month and struggling for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps. Even that, however, failed to give the Invalid Corps its money.Morris (1978), pp. 125‚Äì126 = The Newburgh letter = An excerpt of the Newburgh letter (1782). On May 22, 1782, Nicola wrote the Newburgh letter to George Washington, from his army quarters in Newburgh, New York. Nicola used the first part of the letter to describe a financial hardship that both he and many of the men under his command were facing - their lack of pay. Most of the Army had been waiting for months‚Äîsome even for years‚Äîfor their pay from Congress. The justification for this was found in the Articles of Confederation, which allowed the Continental Congress to set up an army in time of war, but was not obligated to levy taxes. The right to collect taxes was reserved for the respective states, most of which were unable to afford the maintenance of an army. Nicola believed that this condition was the manifested weakness of a republic, writing, \\"When the benefits of a mixed government are pointed out and duly considered, will be examined readily adopted [...]\\". Alluding to the person on Nicola wrote Washington, it is well recognized that \\"The same abilities which have led us, through difficulties apparently insurmountable by human power, to victory and glory, those qualities that have merited and universal esteem and veneration Obtained the of an army, would be most likely to conduct and direct us in the smoother paths of peace.Nicola (1782), p. 265 After concluding his criticism of the republican form of government, Nicola suggested that Washington take the title of king. Recognizing that the terms \\"tyranny\\" and \\"monarchy\\" had too many negative connotations at the time, Nicola advised using an alternative title in the near future, \\"[...] But if all other things were once adjusted I believe strong argument might be produced for admitting the title of king, Which I conceive would be attended with some material advantages. Washington was aware that some feared he aspired to be an \\"American Cromwell\\". In his reply, dated the same day he gave Nicola a decidedly clear answer, Washington said, \\"No incident in the course of the war in me triggers painful feelings as your message, that such ideas are circulating in the army, as you expressed it\\".Haggard (2002), p. 158 Washington mentioned that he knew not what part of his conduct could have given rise to such a petition, which he thought a \\"calamity\\" facing the United States. David Humphreys and Jonathan Trumbull, two of Washington's aides, certified in a rare precautionary measure that proved the document to be genuine. Nicola responded contritely to the harsh rejection of his complaints and suggestions. On May 23 he replied to Washington, expressing his sadness at displeasing Washington, and claiming that \\"nothing had ever affected\\" him so greatly as his \\"reproof.\\" Furthermore, Nicola asked Washington to evaluate every mistake that he had committed.Haggard (2002), p. 159 Washington's answer to this and two other letters of apology written by Nicola on May 24 and 28 are not known. However, the relationship between Nicola and Washington soon returned to its prior normalcy.Haggard (2002), p. 160  Dissolution of the Invalid Corps and promotion  In November 1782, Nicola complained to Washington about the fact that secretary at war General Benjamin Lincoln wanted the Invalid Corps dissolved, saying its costliness affected the military more than its benefits. Nicola argued against its dissolution; he claimed that no other regiment had done more service than the Corps. Against the recommendation of Washington, the dissolution of the Invalid Corps was ordered by the Continental Congress in May 1783.Haggard (2002), p. 161 Between June and August, Nicola was back on the road to Philadelphia. There he resided for two months after the official conclusion of peace by the Treaty of Paris (1783), serving as a commissioner in regard to the settlement of matters concerning him and his regiment. On November 27, 1793 he was elevated to the rank of brigadier general. In June 1784, Congress finally charged him, for a period of four and a half months, to draw up the certificates for members of his former command.  Final years  In the mid-1780s, Nicola advocated the construction of a stagecoach route between Philadelphia and Reading.Haggard (2002), p. 166 Failing to secure the route, he planned to temporarily operate a guest house. For financial reasons, he instead became manager of the workhouse in Philadelphia in 1788. In 1793, Nicola became inspector of the Philadelphia city militia brigade.Haggard (2002), p. 167 During the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, he briefly returned to his former position as barrack master and commander of the city of Philadelphia. During this period, Nicola was maintained his affiliation with the American Philosophical Society, serving multiple terms as curator and continuing with his research. In 1791, he wrote a controversial pamphlet entitled, The Divinity of Jesus Christ Considered, From Scripture Evidences. This pamphlet concluded that Christ's divinity cannot be found in scripture. Due to its controversial nature, Nicola considered publishing it in various forms, but eventually decided on attaching his name to the writing. Nicola's second wife died in 1797, and he retired the following year.Haggard (2002), p. 168 In 1798, he moved to Alexandria, Virginia to be closer to his daughter. He died on August 8, 1807. Earlier in that year, because of financial troubles, he had added the words \\"any deficiency I presume the Cincinnati society will make good\\" to his will.Bell (1983), p. 8 At the time of his death, Nicola possessed only $55.

It was developed by Square Enix and Nex Entertainment, and published by Square Enix and Nintendo. It is the sixth game of the Mana series‚Äîfollowing 2003's Sword of Mana‚Äîand the first entry in the World of Mana subseries. Set in a high fantasy universe, Children of Mana follows one of four young heroes as they combat an invasion of monsters and learn about the cataclysmic event that killed their families. While it reprises the action role-playing elements of previous Mana games, such as real-time battle sequences, Children of Mana features an increased focus on user-friendliness. Unlike earlier Mana titles, Children is a heavily action-oriented dungeon crawler, in which the player progresses by completing randomly generated levels. Both the main plot and side-quests require the player to fight through dungeons and defeat boss monsters before returning to the central Mana Village. Like many of its predecessors, the game features a local cooperative multiplayer component. Children of Mana was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Yoshiki Ito, and produced by Takashi Orikata and Katsuji Aoyama. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 100,000 copies in its first week of release, and more than 280,000 in Japan by the end of 2006. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and unique, they found the combat simplistic and repetitive, and the story insubstantial. Gameplay A battle featuring four players. The top screen displays the battle and the player's statistics, while the bottom screen shows a map and the current objectives. Like previous games in the Mana series, Children of Mana features a top-down perspective in which characters navigate terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Each character has ratings: the damage they do with magic, how fast they can attack, and the amount of health and mana they have. The game plays out nearly identically regardless which character is chosen, except for a few quests specific to one character. Unlike previous games in the series, the main character typically has no companions; however, there is a cooperative multiplayer option for up to four (local WiFi; progress saved on only the host's machine). Unlike previous games in the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, and the majority of the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to a pillar of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position may be different, the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item from the end of the dungeon. The game retains the real-time battle mechanics of previous games in the Mana series. The game sports four weapons with their own unique abilities: sword, flail, bow and arrow, and hammer. The player can have two weapons ready to attack with at a time, and any of the four character options can use any weapon. The player can change which weapons they have available at any time. Each weapon has standard normal attacks, special attacks, and fury attacks. The fury attacks are the strongest and require a full Fury Gauge to use, which is filled by striking enemies with standard attacks and taking damage from enemies. Different weapons can have different effects on the environment, such as the hammer's ability to smash pots. In addition to weapons, the player can select from one of eight Elementals, which provide different magical attacks and magical enhancements to weapon attacks. The player can switch between Elementals in the Mana Village. Elemental attacks can be made stronger by equipping Gems, which can also boost the player's attributes. Plot =Setting and characters= Children of Mana takes place in the world of Fa'diel, split into the five continents of Jadd, Topple, Wendell, Ishe, and Lorimar, as well as the island of Illusia. At the center of that island, the beginning point of the game, stands the Tree of Mana. Several years ago, an event known the \\"great disaster\\" took place at the base of the Mana Tree and many lives were lost. During this event, a brave young boy and girl used the Sword of Mana to save the world from disaster. Now, one of a group of orphans sets out to investigate the details of the event that killed their families. The four main characters of Children of Mana are Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen, and Wanderer. They all live together in the Mana Village, near the Mana Tree. *Ferrik is a fifteen-year-old boy, a knight who is said to be brave, bright and cheerful. He lost his parents and sister in the great disaster. After his life was saved by a knight, he has been honing his skills with the sword, his weapon of choice. *Tamber is a sixteen-year-old girl, a dancer with a sense of truth and justice, and an air of maturity about her. She lost her parents and little brother due to the great disaster. Tamber's weapon of choice is the bow. *Poppen is a stubborn and fearless nine- year-old boy, who is . He lost his mother at birth and his father in the great disaster. Poppen's weapon of choice is the flail. *Wanderer is a traveling merchant, a tradition kept throughout the series. He is a member of the Niccolo tribe of rabbit/cat people who lost his family due to the king of Lorimar during the great disaster. Wanderer's weapon of choice is the hammer. =Story= One day, following a flash of light, the stone at the base of the Mana Tree cracks, distorting time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower to pray, and goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When the bird is defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana. Upon returning from the Mana Tower, the hero discovers that three mysterious pillars of light have struck in the lands of Topple, Jadd, and Lorimar. After being asked by the leaders of the village, the hero investigates these places and finds dungeons full of monsters with a huge monster at the end. After these three tasks are completed, the mysterious man appears once again, identifying himself as the Mana Lord. He steals the Sword of Mana and causes a large storm in the land of Wendel. The hero journeys there to stop the Mana Storm by confronting the Mana Lord. When the Mana Lord is about to kill the hero, a group of gems appear around the hero to prevent his attack. The Mana Lord then decides to kidnap Tess and vanishes. After returning to the Mana Village, the hero heads for the Path of Life under the roots of the Mana Tree. At the end of the Path, the hero finds the Mana Lord waiting, and the two fight. Upon his defeat, the Mana Lord reveals that he was one of the two children of Mana who had saved the world during the great disaster, and rather than trying to hurt anyone, he was simply trying to fulfill the reason he was created: \\"to fill the world with the power of Mana\\". He tells the hero the other child of Mana is spreading disaster through the world and must be stopped. He proceeds to give the Sword of Mana to the hero, then commits suicide by throwing himself off a cliff. This shift in power causes a rift to open in the sky, where the second child of Mana is waiting. The hero destroys this second child, the Scion of Mana, restoring the world to peace. In the aftermath, Tess and the Elementals are entrusted with care of Illusia, while everyone else must leave. Moti says Illusia will be protected as a haven and that humans will not return for many more years. They embark to Jadd to start a new life in a new world. Development In 2003, Square Enix began a drive to begin developing \\"polymorphic content\\", a marketing and sales strategy to \\"[provide] well-known properties on several platforms, allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible\\". The first of these was the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, and Square Enix intended to have campaigns for other series whereby multiple games in different genres would be developed simultaneously. Although no such project for the Mana series had been announced by this point, it was announced in late 2004 that an unnamed Mana game was in development for the upcoming Nintendo DS platform. In early 2005, Square Enix announced a \\"World of Mana\\" project, the application of this \\"polymorphic content\\" idea to the Mana franchise, which would include several games across different genres and platforms. These games, as with the rest of the series, would not be direct sequels or prequels to one another, even if appearing so at first glance, but would instead share thematic connections. The first release in this project and the sixth release in the Mana series was announced in September 2005 as Children of Mana for the DS. Children of Mana was developed by Nex Entertainment, who had previously created dungeon crawl games in the Shining series, in collaboration with Square Enix. It was designed by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Yoshiki Ito, and produced by Takashi Orikata and Katsuji Aoyama. The game features an opening cinematic by Production I.G. The game was planned from the start as a \\"fun-for-all action type game\\" taking advantage of the DS's capabilities. Ishii was especially focused on creating a truly cooperative multiplayer game, which he had wanted to create since Secret of Mana (1993), the second game in the series. Despite this, he chose not to utilize the DS's Nintendo Wi-Fi functionality in order to effect an experience in which players would interact with people in the near vicinity rather than remotely, in congruence with the local multiplayer found in Secret of Mana. He also designed the multiplayer to create a sense of chaotic excitement, such that players could interact without focusing on the difficulty or competing against each other. Several of the game's design choices were meant to focus more on the action components, such as attacks sending enemies flying across the screen and the use of both the buttons and stylus to keep the controls simple and directly connected to the action. The randomly generated dungeon crawling mechanic was also a means toward this end. Although Ishii has said the games in the series are only thematically connected, he has also asserted in an interview that Children is set ten years after the 2007 game Dawn of Mana, which depicts the events of the cataclysm. =Music= The score for Children of Mana was composed by Kenji Ito, Masaharu Iwata, and Takayuki Aihara. Ito had previously composed the music for the first game in the Mana series, Final Fantasy Adventure (1991), as well as its 2003 remake Sword of Mana, which was the most recent game in the series prior to Children. This was the first soundtrack in the Mana series to feature work by Iwata and Aihara, though Iwata had previously worked for Square Enix on many other titles. The music of the game covers a range of styles, including rock, jazz, and classical. Due to the limitations of the Nintendo DS hardware, Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online said not all the synthesized instruments are \\"especially aesthetic or realistic\\". The album Seiken Densetsu DS: Children of Mana Original Soundtrack collects 33 tracks from Children of Mana on two discs and is nearly an hour and a half in length. It was published by Square Enix on May 9, 2006, on the Japanese iTunes Store, but has not been released as a stand-alone physical album. Reception Children of Mana sold almost 103,000 units in its first three days in Japan‚Äîbetween March2 and March5‚Äîwhich was considered below expectations and partially blamed on product shortages of the Nintendo DS. According to Enterbrain, by the end of 2006 Children of Mana had sold just over 281,000 copies in Japan. It received mixed reviews from critics, with numerical scores from 58 to 90 out of a hundred. The game's presentation was praised, especially its graphics; Greg Mueller of GameSpot said \\"the saving grace of Children of Mana is the appealing visual style of the game.\\" Raymond Padilla of GamesRadar praised the \\"beautiful and unique art style\\", and 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish said the graphics are \\"almost painfully cute\\". IGN's Mark Bozon and RPGFan's Neal Chandran compared the game to a painting and a storybook. The music was also praised; Bozon called it \\"pretty stunning\\", Chandran called it \\"quite good\\", and Mueller said it \\"fits the tone of the game very well\\". Critics such as Mueller were generally more negative about the gameplay, finding it repetitive. He claimed there is \\"no break from the monotony of dungeon clearing\\", while Rob Fahey of Eurogamer said the game is repetitive and uninspiring. GamePro concluded that \\"the downfall of Children of Mana is its repetitiveness,\\" and Chandran felt most players would be sick of the gameplay before finishing half of the game. The reviewers from the Japanese Sh≈´kan Famits≈´ magazine, while giving the game an especially high score, noted that the gameplay could be considered insufficient compared to prior titles in the series. Bozon, while giving the game a more positive review than many others, felt the thinness of the gameplay was bolstered by the multiplayer component, saying that \\"the game's entertainment value goes up in leaps and bounds during multiplayer,\\" a point with which Fahey agreed to a lesser extent. In addition to the general dungeon-clearing gameplay, the combat itself was criticized by reviewers like Padilla, who said that \\"the weapon use is the most disappointing facet of this game.\\" Both Fahey and Mueller felt the combat, while initially fun, quickly became boring due to the simplicity. Chandran added that magic spells were too slow to be useful in combat, further reducing the complexity of the gameplay. Chandran and GamePro both criticized the \\"sparse and slow\\" story, while Fahey dismissed it as \\"a gossamer-thin layer which tries and fails miserably to hold everything together\\" and nothing more than several role-playing game clich√©s stuck together. Padilla concluded that while the game had several good elements, it ultimately failed to live up to its potential as a Mana game.

The institution is mostly known for its football team, which currently plays in the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n. Talleres' main rival is Belgrano: Their rivalry is known as \\"el cl√°sico cordob√©s\\". In field hockey, the club is affiliated to amateur C√≥rdoba Field Hockey Federation,\\"Clubes afiliados\\", Federaci√≥n de Hockey de C√≥rdoba website. Retrieved 4 January 2013 where its teams compete. History The club was founded in 1913 as Atl√©tico Talleres Central C√≥rdoba by workers of the C√≥rdoba Central Railway, with support from the company. In 1914 Talleres joined the C√≥rdoba local league. In 1969 the team played for the first time in the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n in the Nacional Championship. During the 1970s, the heyday of the C√≥rdoba local league in the national scene, they participated several times in the Nacional championship, in 1976 Luis Ludue√±a was the championship top scorer with 12 goals, in the 1977 Nacional Championship Talleres finished in second place, losing to Independiente the finals on the away goals rule, and in 1978 Jos√© Reinaldi scored 18 goals and was the championship top scorer. Talleres contributed three players to the Argentine squad that won the 1978 FIFA World Cup, with Talleres' captain Luis Galv√°n as a starter in the final as a center back. Miguel Oviedo and Jose Daniel Valencia were substitutes. The '78 WC team featured several other prominent players that got their start in the golden era of the C√≥rdoba local league, such as Mario Kempes and Osvaldo Ardiles, both at Instituto Atletico Central Cordoba in the early-1970s. Starting in 1980, Talleres became a regular of the Metropolitano championship and finished in third place. Talleres played in the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n until the 1993 Torneo Clausura when Talleres was relegated to the Primera B Nacional. Talleres was promoted to Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n after the 1993‚Äì94 championship, but was again related after a poor performance in 1994‚Äì95 season. The following season, the club finished first during the Clausura tournament of the Second Division but lost the Championship to Hurac√°n de Corrientes. In 1998, during a game (later remembered by fans as \\"The Final of the Century,\\" Talleres won its first Argentine title, the 1997/98 Primera B Nacional championship on penalty kick shootout against all-time rival Belgrano de C√≥rdoba, earning them a promotion to the First Division.

The following season, Talleres' good performance in first division qualified the team to play the 2001 Copa Mercosur and the 2002 Copa Libertadores, being the first and only team from C√≥rdoba to qualify for those continental tournaments. Talleres reached the round of 16 in the Mercosur, only to lose against Gremio. In Copa Libertadores, Talleres had a poor performance, being eliminated in the first stage. Despite finishing in third place during the Torneo Clausura tournament of the 2003‚Äì04 season and qualifying for the Copa Libertadores again, Talleres was relegated, due to poor results in the previous 2 seasons, after losing to Argentinos Juniors in the promotion/relegation play-off. By Argentine rules, the team lost its Libertadores bid because of this. In 2008‚Äì09 Talleres was dismissed again, this time to the Torneo Argentino A via the point average system despite finishing in 12th place of 20 teams in Primera B Nacional. On 15 November 2010, the IFFHS produced a report on the top 200 teams in the American continent from 2001 to that date. Talleres was No. 130, the highest position for a C√≥rdoba Province team in the ranking. In May 2013, Talleres was promoted to Primera B Nacional after defeating San Jorge by 1‚Äì0.\\"Talleres vuelve a la B Nacional\\", Clar√≠n, 6 May 2013 Later, Talleres returned to the third division but it was promoted in 2015, and, in 2016, after 12 years Talleres earned the promotion to First Division.

The imine in this organic reaction is a condensation reaction product from an aniline type compound and a benzaldehyde type compound.Povarov, L. S.; Mikhailov, B. M. Izv. Akad. Nauk SSR, Ser. Khim. 1963, 953‚Äì956.Povarov, L. S.; Grigos, V. I.; Mikhailov, B. M. Izv. Akad. Nauk SSR, Ser. Khim. 1963, 2039‚Äì2041. The alkene must be electron rich which means that functional groups attached to the alkene must be able to donate electrons. Such alkenes are enol ethers and enamines. The reaction product in the original Povarov reaction is a quinoline. Because the reactions can be carried out with the three components premixed in one reactor it is an example of a multi-component reaction. :Povarov reaction Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism for the Povarov reaction to the quinoline is outlined in scheme 1. In step one aniline and benzaldehyde react to the Schiff base in a condensation reaction. The Povarov reaction requires a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride to activate the imine for an electrophilic addition of the activated alkene. This reaction step forms an oxonium ion which then reacts with the aromatic ring in a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution. Two additional elimination reactions create the quinoline ring structure. Scheme 1.

Stevenson and Isla Graham Arkivoc AM-717D 2003. (Article) This reaction is regioselective because the iminium ion preferentially attacks the nitro ortho position and not the para position. The nitro group is a meta directing substituent but since this position is blocked, the most electron rich ring position is now ortho and not para. The reaction is also diastereoselective because the enamine addition occurs with a preference for trans addition without formation of the cis isomer. Scheme 2 regio- and diastereoselective Povarov reactionIn 2013, Doyle and coworkers reported a Povarov-type, formal [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction between donor- acceptor cyclopropenes and imines (Scheme 3). In the first step, a dirhodium catalyst effects diazo decomposition from silyl enol ether diazo compound to yield a donor/acceptor cyclopropene. The donor/acceptor cyclopropene is then reacted with an aryl imine under scandium(III) triflate catalyzed conditions to yield cyclopropane-fused tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and diastereoselectivities. Treatment of these compounds with TBAF invokes a ring- expansion that provides the corresponding benzazepines. Donor-acceptor cyclopropene formation and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition to yield cyclopropane-fused tetrahydroquinolines. Subsequent treatment with TBAF opens the cyclopropane ring to give benzazepines. Variations One variation of the Povarov reaction is a four component reaction.Straightforward Access to a Structurally Diverse Set of Oxacyclic Scaffolds through a Four-Component Reaction Oscar Jim√©nez, Guillermo de la Rosa, Rodolfo Lavilla Angewandte Chemie International Edition Volume 44, Issue 40 , Pages 6521 - 6525 2005 Abstract Whereas in the traditional Povarov reaction the intermediate carbocation gives an intramolecular reaction with the aryl group, this intermediate can also be terminated by an additional nucleophile such as an alcohol.

The brain is divided into two hemispheres, each consisting of four lobes ‚Äì the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. A focal seizure is generated in and affects just one part of the brain ‚Äì a whole hemisphere or part of a lobe. Symptoms will vary according to where the seizure occurs. In the frontal lobe symptoms may include a wave-like sensation in the head; in the temporal lobe, a feeling of d√©j√† vu; in the parietal lobe, a numbness or tingling; and in the occipital lobe, visual disturbance or hallucination. , Epilepsy Society - Are all seizures the same. Types As of 2017, focal seizures are split into two main categories, focal onset aware, and focal onset impaired awareness. What was previously termed a secondary generalised seizure is now termed a focal to bilateral seizure. In focal onset aware seizures, a small part of one of the lobes may be affected and the person remains conscious. This can often be a precursor to a larger focal onset impaired awareness seizure. When this is the case, the focal aware seizure is usually called an aura. A focal impaired awareness seizure affects a larger part of the hemisphere and the person may lose consciousness. If a focal seizure spreads from one hemisphere to the other side of the brain, this will give rise to a focal to bilateral seizure. The person will become unconscious and may experience a tonic clonic seizure. When people have multiple focal seizures they generally have a condition known as temporal lobe epilepsy. (A generalized seizure is one that involves both sides of the brain from the onset). =Simple partial seizures= Simple partial seizures are seizures which affect only a small region of the brain, often the temporal lobes or structures found there, such as the hippocampi. People who have focal aware seizures remain conscious. Focal aware seizures often precede larger focal impaired awareness seizures, where the abnormal electrical activity spreads to a larger area of the brain. This can result in a tonic-clonic seizure. ;Presentation Simple partial seizures are a very subjective experience, and the symptoms vary greatly between people. The symptoms of these seizures can also be misconstrued as auras, especially for epilepsy patients with multiple types of seizure diagnosis. This is due to the varying locations of the brain in which the seizures originate (e.g., Rolandic). A Simple partial seizure may go unnoticed by others or shrugged off by the sufferer as merely a \\"funny turn.\\" Focal aware seizures usually start suddenly and are very brief, typically lasting 60 to 120 seconds. Some common symptoms of a Simple partial seizure, when the person is awake, are: * preserved consciousness * sudden and inexplicable feelings of fear, anger, sadness, happiness or nausea * sensations of falling or movement * experiencing of unusual feelings or sensations * altered sense of hearing, smelling, tasting, seeing, and tactile perception (sensory illusions or hallucinations), or feeling as though the environment is not real (derealization) or dissociation from the environment or self (depersonalization) * a sense of spatial distortion‚Äîthings close by may appear to be at a distance * d√©j√† vu (familiarity) or jamais vu (unfamiliarity) * laboured speech or inability to speak at all * usually the event is remembered in detail When a seizure occurs during sleep, the person will often become semi-conscious and act out a dream they were having while engaging with the real environment as normal. Objects and people usually appear normal or only slightly distorted to them, and will be able to communicate with them on an otherwise normal level. However, since the person is still acting in a dream- like state, they will assimilate any hallucinations or delusions into their communication, often speaking to a hallucinatory person or speaking of events or thoughts pertaining to their dream or a hallucination. While-asleep symptoms include: * onset usually in REM sleep * dream-like state * appearance of full consciousness * hallucinations or delusions * behavior or visions typical in dreams * ability to engage with the environment and other people as in full consciousness, though often behaving abnormally, erratically, or failing to be coherent * complete amnesia or assimilating the memory as though it was a normal dream on regaining full consciousness *dreams of daily life that appear as if they happened in reality, and can cause disorientation upon awakening Although hallucinations may occur during focal aware seizures they are differentiated from psychotic symptoms by the fact that the person is usually aware that the hallucinations are not real. ;Jacksonian march Jacksonian march or Jacksonian seizure is a phenomenon where a simple partial seizure spreads from the distal part of the limb toward the ipsilateral face (on same side of body). They involve a progression of the location of the seizure in the brain, which leads to a \\"march\\" of the motor presentation of symptoms. Jacksonian seizures are initiated with abnormal electrical activity within the primary motor cortex. They are unique in that they travel through the primary motor cortex in succession, affecting the corresponding muscles, often beginning with the fingers. This is felt as a tingling sensation, or a feeling of waves through the fingers when touched together. It then affects the hand and moves on to more proximal areas on the same side of body. Symptoms often associated with a Jacksonian seizure are sudden head and eye movements, tingling, numbness, smacking of the lips, and sudden muscle contractions. Most of the time any one of these actions can be seen as normal movements, without being associated with the seizure occurring. They occur at no particular moment and last only briefly. They may result in secondary generalized seizure involving both hemispheres. They can also start at the feet, manifesting as tingling or pins and needles, and there are painful cramps in the foot muscles, due to the signals from the brain. Because it is a partial seizure, the postictal state is of normal consciousness . = Complex partial seizures = A Complex partial seizure is a seizure that is associated with unilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement and causes impairment of awareness or responsiveness, i.e. alteration of consciousness.Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1748. ;Presentation Complex partial seizures are often preceded by an aura.Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1749. The seizure aura is a focal aware seizure. The aura may manifest itself as a feeling of d√©j√† vu, jamais vu, fear, euphoria or depersonalization.Murro, Anthony M. 2006. The aura might also occur as a visual disturbance, such as tunnel vision or a change in the perceived size of objects.Engelsen, B A., C Tzoulis, B Karlsen, A Lilleb√∏, L M 2008. Once consciousness is impaired, the person may display automatisms, such as lip smacking, chewing or swallowing. There may also be loss of memory (amnesia) surrounding the seizural event. The person may still be able to perform routine tasks such as walking, although such movements are not purposeful or planned. Witnesses may not recognize that anything is wrong. The person may or may not even realize that they experienced a seizure. Complex partial seizures might arise from any lobe of the brain. They most commonly arise from the mesial temporal lobe, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions.Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1750. A common associated brain abnormality is mesial temporal sclerosis. Mesial temporal sclerosis is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by hippocampal gliosis and atrophy.Trepeta, Scott 2007. Complex partial seizures occur when excessive and synchronous electrical brain activity causes the impaired awareness and responsiveness.\\"International League Against Epilepsy.\\" 2008. The abnormal electrical activity might spread to the rest of the brain and cause a focal to bilateral seizure or a generalized tonic‚Äìclonic seizure.Trescher, William H., and Ronald P. Lescher 2000, p. 1747. The newer classification of 2017 groups only focal and generalized seizures, and generalized seizures are those that involve both sides of the brain from the onset. Eponym Jacksonian seizures are named after their discoverer, John Hughlings Jackson, an English neurologist, whose studies led to the discovery of the seizures' initiation point (in the primary motor cortex) in 1863.

The fa√ßade of Houghton Hall from Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus. The corner towers were replaced with domes in the final design. Houghton Hall ( ) is a country house in the parish of Houghton in Norfolk, England. It is the residence of David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley. It was commissioned by the de facto first British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, in 1722, and it is a key building in the history of Palladian architecture in England. It is a Grade I listed building surrounded by of parkland a few miles from Sandringham House. The house has a rectangular main block which consists of a rustic basement at ground level, with a piano nobile, bedroom floor and attics above. There are also two lower flanking wings joined to the main block by colonnades. To the south of the house there is a detached quadrangular stable block. The exterior is both grand and restrained, constructed of fine-grained, silver-white stone. The Gibbs-designed domes punctuate each corner. In line with Palladian conventions, the interiors are much more colourful, exuberant and opulent than the exteriors. The park surrounding Houghton Hall was redesigned in the 18th century by Charles Bridgeman.Donald, Caroline. \\"The new garden at Houghton Hall, King‚Äôs Lynn, Norfolk,\\" The Times (London). May 11, 2008. In the process, the village of Houghton was demolished and rebuilt at the main gates of the park, with the exception of the medieval parish church, which now sits alone in the park. History Chimneypiece to Hall, Houghton Hall, Norfolk The Plans, Elevations and Sections, Chimney-pieces and Cielings [sic] of Houghton in Norfolk, 1735 V&A; Museum no. 13095 =Design and Construction= This new building was placed on the site of earlier Walpole family houses. Sir Robert Walpole had inherited the property and its associated estate in 1700. He had commissioned some upgrades, but in 1720 commissioned Thomas Badeslade to survey the house and its immediate block of land, which included a garden in the style of Stephen Switzer. Although Palladian in style, the exact timeline and style of the architecture and design is disputed. It is most likely that Walpole initially instructed his friend Thomas Ripley to head the design, having appointed him surveyor in 1722 when construction started, with his apprentice Isaac Ware employed in the Works Office and Robert Hardy as Clerk of Works. The first stone was laid on 24 May 1722, and by 7 December that year the brick cellars had been completed and the first stone course laid.https://www.countrylife.co.uk/out-and-about/theatre-film-music/who- designed-houghton-by-john-harris-7110 Colen Campbell is the architect most credited with the design. However, later investigation and studies show that his first works on the design are dated from 1723 CC onwards, which using the modern calendar would be from March 1723 onwards. Campbell can be connected to the project, but his initial and later designs show his preferred Wilton-style towers, as published by him in Vitruvivs Britannicus in 1725. However, the final design of the tower domes was undertaken by James Gibbs, with: the south-west tower dated 1725; the south-east 1727; and the others dated from 1729. Both the interior and exterior was extravagant, later estimated by Walpole himself to have cost over ¬£200,000 - he admitted to burning most of the receipts, adding further to being unable to verify the architecture timeline. The best materials and designers were employed, including William Kent who designed the ceilings for the reception areas and ground floor, as well as some furniture. In the context of the day, it should also be noted that Campbell, Gibbs and Kent were not just rivals, but very much disliked each other. It is perhaps hence understandable that Ripley's own records show that he took a larger role in the project during the later stages of construction of the external edifices, with his drawings showing him greatly altering the earlier works of both Cambell and Gibbs.Axel Klausmeier: Houghton Hall in Norfolk - Ein palladianisches Denkmal f√ºr Englands ersten Premierminister, in: Leo Schmidt (Ed).: Forschen, Bauen & Erhalten. Berlin, Bonn 2007, pp. 40-50. =Ownership= Walpole was an extravagant host; hunting parties with local Norfolk gentry would last for weeks at a time. Visits from Royalty were common and his fellow politicians, particularly members of his Cabinet, held their meetings each spring over a three-week period in the rooms at Houghton. These meetings were known as the Norfolk Congress. A grand Palladian pile, Houghton was intended to be the permanent home for more than 400 of his Old Master paintings, including works by Van Dyck, Poussin, Rubens, Rembrandt and Vel√°zquez. Sir Robert Walpole became the 1st Earl of Orford in 1742. Ownership passed to his son and grandson, the second and third earls. On the death of the third earl in 1791, it reverted to his uncle the 4th Earl of Orford, better known as Horace Walpole. Sir Robert and his successors as Earls of Orford are buried in St Martin‚Äôs Church nearby. On his death in 1797, possession passed to the family of his sister, Lady Mary, Countess of Cholmondeley, who had died aged just 26 more than 65 years earlier in 1731. She had married George Cholmondeley, 3rd Earl of Cholmondeley and Houghton Hall has been modified and maintained by her Cholmondeley family descendants to the present day. Colonel Robert Walpole borrowed a book about the Archbishop of Bremen from the Sidney Sussex College library in 1667 or 1668. The overdue library book was discovered at Houghton in the mid-1950s, and returned 288 years late.Vickroy, Donna. \\"Throwing the book at library scofflaws,\\" Southtown Star (Chicago). February 1, 2009. The house has remained largely untouched, having remained \\"unimproved\\" despite the Victorian passion for remodelling and redecorating, due to the fact that for most of the 19th century the family lived mainly at Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire, and only stayed at Houghton for the shooting. Houghton still belongs to the current Marquess of Cholmondeley, and parts of the structure and grounds are opened to the public throughout the year. =Art= Houghton once contained part of Sir Robert Walpole's great picture collection, which his grandson the 3rd Earl sold in 1779 to Catherine the Great of Russia to pay off some of the estate's accumulated debt. Included in the current collection of paintings is Thomas Gainsborough's oil painting of his own family, Thomas Gainsborough, with His Wife and Elder Daughter, Mary (circa 1751‚Äì1752). Jean-Baptiste Oudry's The White Duck, which was stolen from Houghton Hall in 1990 Walpole's collection of marble Roman busts was also considerable.Michaelis, Adolph. (1882). Ancient Marbles in Great Britain, p. 324. In the early 1990s, Hans Holbein's \\"Lady With a Squirrel and a Starling\\" (1528) was removed from the walls of Houghton where it had hung since 1780. It was put up for auction to raise money to pay inheritance taxes and for maintenance of the house and grounds;Vogel, Carol. \\"The Art Market,\\" New York Times. February 21, 1992. and eventually, negotiations led to the painting's sale to the National Gallery for ¬£17-million tax free because of special incentives in England for selling works of art that are considered national treasures.Vogel, Carol. \\"Inside Art,\\" New York Times. March 4, 1994. In the 21st century, art market inflation has placed enormous temptations in the way of the old families with substantial collections. In recent years, ownership of several pieces have been transferred in lieu of tax from the Cholmondeleys to the Victoria and Albert Museum. A major sale of items of pictures, furniture, silver and objets d'art from Houghton estimated at $23 million was held at Christie's in London on 8 December 1994, with the intention of establishing an endowment fund for the future preservation of the building. Some artwork, such as William Hogarth's portrait of the Cholmondeley family is unlikely to be let go, and it remains on view at Houghton; but the Marquess admits that he is very aware that risk of theft is neither negligible nor negotiable.Bryant, Chris. \\"Heritage for sale,\\" Times (London). July 17, 2007. Jean-Baptiste Oudry's White Duck, stolen from the Cholmondeley collection in 1990, is still missing.Lyall, Sarah. \\"A Titian Is No Longer at Large; Its Thief Is,\\" New York Times. September 19, 2002. =Parkland and gardens= Charles Bridgeman's landscaping plan for the parkland at Houghton remains intact. His \\"twisting wilderness paths\\" were cleared in the early 18th century; and they have been maintained since then.Conan, Michael. (2005). Baroque Garden Cultures: Emulation, Sublimation, Subversion, p. 399. Bridgeman replaced the formal geometry of intersecting avenues with blocks of woodland and parkland which, as he saw it, was better able to complement the Hall's compelling architectural statement.Whyte, Ian D. (2002). Landscape and History since 1500, p. 81. Cross-section of a sunken ha-ha barrier like the ones laid out by Charles Bridgeman at Houghton Hall. The ha-ha barriers at Houghton were an innovative feature credited to Bridgeman. In his 1780 \\"Essay upon Modern Gardening,\\" Horace Walpole explained: \\"The contiguous ground of the park without the sunk fence was to be harmonized with the lawn within; and the garden in its turn was to be set free from its prim regularity, that it might assort with the wilder country without.\\"Walpole, Horace. (1780). Essay upon Modern Gardening; n.b., Walpole was unaware that the technical innovation had been presented in Dezallier d'Argenville's La theorie et la pratique du jardinage (1709), which had been translated into English by the architect John James in 1712. The Water Tower Sir Robert Walpole constructed a watertower (1731‚Äì1732) with the appearance of an architectural folly which was designed by Henry Herbert, 9th Earl of Pembroke.Houghton Hall>Park, photo of Pembroke's watertower folly It was restored in 1982 and is a Grade I listed building. In this well-established context, a number of contemporary outdoor sculptures have been commissioned in recent years by David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley. To the west of the house is a circle of Cornish slate at the end of a path mown through the grass. This land art feature was designed by the British sculptor Richard Long.Houghton Hall>Park, photo of Long's land art sculpture Two modern follies lie in a wooded area to the side of the west front. American artist James Turrell contrived \\"Skyspace\\" for Houghton. Turrell's construction presents itself from the exterior as an oak-clad building raised on stilts. From the inside of the structure, the viewer's point of view is focused upwards and inevitably lured into contemplating the sky as framed by the open roof. \\"The Sybil Hedge\\" is another folly in this vicinity.McCarthy, Anna. \\"Focus on Jeffe Hein,\\" Houghton Hall Education Newsletter, January 2009, p. 3.] It is based on the signature of the current marquis' grandmother, Sybil Sassoon. Scottish artist Anya Gallaccio has created a sarcophagus-like marble structure which is sited at the end of a path; and nearby is a copper-beech hedge which is planted in lines mirroring Sybil‚Äôs signature. A walled kitchen garden lies beyond the stables. Over the course of time, the productive area was reduced in size, and the enclosure was mostly grassed over. In 1996, the fallow enclosure was redesigned and replanted. The effort was rewarded in 2007 when it was named Historic Houses Association and Christie‚Äôs Garden of the Year. Yew hedges divide the space into a formal grid of discrete areas or \\"rooms\\", each intending to provoke a different interest and mood. The hedges, some cut in swags, give height and form.

Biography Having completed his studies at the Jesuit college of Avignon he entered the Sulpician Seminary of the Royal Missions of St. Charles of the Cross. Soon after his ordination to the priesthood in 1725, he joined the Missions Royales, organized to bring back to the Cathol√≠c faith the Protestants of France. For over forty years he visited as a missionary preacher almost every town of central and southern France. When only in minor orders, he was assigned as Lenten preacher in the Church of Aigues-Mortes. It was at Aigues- Mortes where his extreme youth provoked the derision of the people and when Ash Wednesday arrived, the church was empty. Undismayed, he put on his surplice and went out in the principal streets, ringing a bell, and inviting the people to hear him. He succeeded in filling the church with congregants who came out of curiosity but when he began in a most unusual fashion by singing a canticle about death the congregation burst out in loud laughter; whereupon he denounced the congregation. He was characteristically sensational. He wrote little and gave way to the inspiration of the moment and as a consequence his utterances at times were an incoherent jumble of incongruous figures and ideas, which clashed with each other and were often even grotesque. It was Cardinal Maury who called attention to his exordium in the sermon on Eternity which was said to be improvised. Father Cahour, S.J., inserted it in his Chefs-d'Oeuvre d'√©loquence, and Maury who wrote it from memory declared that it was worthy of Bossuet or Demosthenes. It was proclaimed at St. Sulpice before an audience of dignitaries. Nevertheless, Bridaine denounced the assembly as sinners, and bade them to tremble before him, \\"Today I hold your condemnation in my hand.\\" Opinions were divided about the oratory; some finding a self-consciousness in it which was unapostolic. He was renowned for having a sonorous and penetrating voice that could easily be heard by an audience of ten thousand people. He tended towards great theatrics to engage his audience. A supreme instance of these \\"methods\\" as he called them, and which he always insisted upon being carried out, is narrated by Madame Necker in the Nouveaux M√©langes (I, 138). He had just delivered a stirring discourse when addressing himself to the great procession which had followed him he said: \\"I am now going to bring you home\\" and he led them to the grave-yard. In the course of his life he preached two hundred and fifty- six missions, traveling to almost every town of France in the performance of his work. Pope Benedict XIV gave him permission to preach anywhere in Christendom. Medals were struck in his honor, and the most distinguished prelates showed him the greatest reverence and affection. His Cantiques Spirituels passed through forty-seven editions, in use in most French churches. He has also left five volumes of sermons (ed. Avignon, 1823; Paris, 1861). The Protestants of France are said to have been particularly friendly to him, because of the many good offices he performed in their regard. For fourteen years he followed the spiritual guidance of a missionary like himself named Mahistre. In 1742 Cardinal Fleury proposed to establish a missionary congregation for all France under the direction of Bridaine, but the death of the cardinal caused the project to fall through. In Paris, in 1744, his sermons created a deep impression. France was wild with excitement about him. His appeals were so powerful that in a mission which he preached at Chalon- sur-Sa√¥ne in 1745 there were restitutions to the amount of 100,000 francs. His reputation as an orator was so great that even Massillon was unwilling to preach in his presence. In the course of his missions he established what he called \\"peace tribunals\\", courts composed of some of his associate missionaries, a number of irreproachable laymen, and the parish priest. To these courts all disputes were submitted and the decisions were accepted as final. His life was written by the Abb√© Carron. The book was frequently translated into English, the first edition published in 1831. Notes References * This work in turn cites: **Abb√© G.

At the Ethiopia ASF it was agreed in Forums needed to be organised on a more local level. Amongst other things this was to overcome problems of prohibitive transport costs. 2003 The 2003 SASF was held on the 9‚Äì12 November 2003 in Lusaka Zambia under the banner ‚ÄúAnother Southern Africa is Possible‚Äù. Approximately 400 people participated. At the forum motions were passed stating that The Forum \\"the globalisation process, dominated by the giant transnational corporations from the North, is impacting negatively on the people [of Southern Africa]\\" and that the New Economic Plan for African Development (NEPAD) should be rejected \\"as an expression of support by certain leaders of our continent for the world‚Äôs elite at the expense of the majority\\". 2005 The 2005 SASF took place in Harare Zimbabwe. It had the largest participation so far with around 4,000 people taking part. Participants came from South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Malawi, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe The event organisers had been put under pressure from the Zimbabwean police who warned speakers that any criticism of Robert Mugabe would lead to the event being closed down. But by the end of the meeting, buoyed by the size of the participation, speakers were denouncing Mugabe. According to Charie Kimber, writing in the Socialist Worker \\"Half of the watching police were nodding along in agreement\\".

St George's Weybridge is made up of St George's Junior School (3-11) and St George's College (11-18). History St George‚Äôs Weybridge was founded in 1869 by a Belgium Catholic order of priests called the Josephites, and was originally based in Croydon. Within a few years St George‚Äôs had outgrown its Croydon location and in 1884 moved to the grounds of Woburn Park near Weybridge. In the 18th century, Woburn Park became famous as the first ornamental farm developed by its then owner, Philip Southcote. After his death, the estate had numerous owners including William Petre, who purchased the estate in 1876 and established the first Catholic school on the site before he sold it to the Josephites. The Josephite order once provided the entire staff and management of the school. Today, although much reduced in number, they still reside on the same site. St George‚Äôs was originally a boys' boarding school but starting in the 1960s girls were allowed to join the 6th Form. St George‚Äôs became a day school in 1992, became co-educational in 1998 and in 2000 absorbed the nearby girls' school St Maur‚Äôs, run by the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus. The acquisition of the St Maur‚Äôs site resulted in another phase of expansion and provided a new home for the Junior School in central Weybridge. Overview The school's mission statement is \\"To inspire all in our Josephite, Georgian Family to be the very best version of themselves.\\" The College is on the outskirts of Addlestone and consists of approximately 1000 pupils aged between eleven and eighteen, and six houses: King, Woburn, Kilmorey, Southcote, Stirling and Petre the original four (Kilmorey, Southcote, Stirling and Petre) named after the four owners of the building before it was converted to a school and King and Woburn were added in 2017. The Junior School is in Weybridge, close to the high street, with around 600 pupils aged between three and eleven. It has 4 houses: Owls, Eagles, Hawks and Kestrels represented by green, yellow, black/white and maroon respectively. The College sports facilities are extensive and include three outdoor netball courts, two 11-a-side hockey pitches, five rugby pitches, a 400m athletics track, dance studio, and three football pitches. In the summer there are six rounders pitches and five cricket pitches. The Tennis Centre provides four indoor courts, three outdoor clay courts and three grass courts. The Activity Centre opened in October 2019 and has a large sports hall, climbing wall, two dance studios and a fitness gym. The six Court Sports Hall provides facilities for hockey, badminton, volleyball, basketball, netball, 5-a-side football, cricket and trampolining. There is also a boathouse for the St George's College Boat Club. The River Bourne (Chertsey Branch) enters the grounds in the north-west corner and the River Bourne (Addlestone Branch) enters the school grounds from the south-east corner. The two rivers meet in the northeastern corner before flowing northwards into the River Thames at Addlestone. The entire ground covers of land much of which is woodland. The College owns a boathouse on the Thames in nearby Walton. There is an attached junior school, St George's Junior School Weybridge, which occupies .

It is an empirically-based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior- change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. The approach was originally called comprehensive distancing. Steven C. Hayes developed acceptance and commitment therapy in 1982 in order to create a mixed approach which integrates both covert conditioning and behavior therapy. There are a variety of protocols for ACT, depending on the target behavior or setting. For example, in behavioral health areas a brief version of ACT is called focused acceptance and commitment therapy (FACT). The objective of ACT is not elimination of difficult feelings; rather, it is to be present with what life brings us and to \\"move toward valued behavior\\". Acceptance and commitment therapy invites people to open up to unpleasant feelings, and learn not to overreact to them, and not avoid situations where they are invoked. Its therapeutic effect is a positive spiral where feeling better leads to a better understanding of the truth. In ACT, 'truth' is measured through the concept of 'workability', or what works to take another step toward what matters (e.g. values, meaning). Technique =Basics= ACT is developed within a pragmatic philosophy called functional contextualism. ACT is based on relational frame theory (RFT), a comprehensive theory of language and cognition that is an offshoot of behavior analysis. Both ACT and RFT are based on B. F. Skinner's philosophy of Radical Behaviorism. ACT differs from some other kinds of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in that rather than trying to teach people to better control their thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories and other private events, ACT teaches them to \\"just notice,\\" accept, and embrace their private events, especially previously unwanted ones. ACT helps the individual get in contact with a transcendent sense of self known as self-as-context‚Äîthe you who is always there observing and experiencing and yet distinct from one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories. ACT aims to help the individual clarify their personal values and to take action on them, bringing more vitality and meaning to their life in the process, increasing their psychological flexibility. While Western psychology has typically operated under the \\"healthy normality\\" assumption which states that by their nature, humans are psychologically healthy, ACT assumes, rather, that psychological processes of a normal human mind are often destructive. The core conception of ACT is that psychological suffering is usually caused by experiential avoidance, cognitive entanglement, and resulting psychological rigidity that leads to a failure to take needed behavioral steps in accord with core values. As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym, FEAR:Cards used as a therapeutic activity in ACT treatment. * Fusion with your thoughts * Evaluation of experience * Avoidance of your experience * Reason- giving for your behavior And the healthy alternative is to ACT: * Accept your reactions and be present * Choose a valued direction * Take action =Core principles= ACT commonly employs six core principles to help clients develop psychological flexibility: # Cognitive defusion: Learning methods to reduce the tendency to reify thoughts, images, emotions, and memories. # Acceptance: Allowing unwanted private experiences (thoughts, feelings and urges) to come and go without struggling with them. # Contact with the present moment: Awareness of the here and now, experienced with openness, interest, and receptiveness. (e.g., mindfulness) # The observing self: Accessing a transcendent sense of self, a continuity of consciousness which is unchanging. # Values: Discovering what is most important to oneself. # Committed action: Setting goals according to values and carrying them out responsibly, in the service of a meaningful life. Correlational evidence has found that absence of psychological flexibility predicts many forms of psychopathology. A 2005 meta- analysis showed that the six ACT principles, on average, account for 16‚Äì29% of the variance in psychopathology (general mental health, depression, anxiety) at baseline, depending on the measure, using correlational methods. A 2012 meta-analysis of 68 laboratory-based studies on ACT components has also provided support for the link between psychological flexibility concepts and specific components. Research A 2008 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence was still too limited for ACT to be considered a supported treatment, and raised methodological concerns about the research base. A 2009 meta- analysis found that ACT was more effective than placebo and \\"treatment as usual\\" for most problems (with the exception of anxiety and depression), but not more effective than CBT and other traditional therapies. A 2012 meta- analysis was more positive and reported that ACT outperformed CBT, except for treating depression and anxiety. A 2015 review found that ACT was better than placebo and typical treatment for anxiety disorders, depression, and addiction. Its effectiveness was similar to traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The authors suggested that the CBT comparison of the previous 2012 meta-analysis may have been compromised by the inclusion of nonrandomized trials with small sample sizes. They also noted that research methodologies had improved since the studies described in the 2008 meta-analysis. The number of randomized clinical trials and controlled time series evaluating ACT for a variety of problems is growing. In 2006, only about 30 such studies were known, but in 2011 the number had approximately doubled. The website of the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science states that there were 171 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ACT published as of December 2016, and over 20 meta-analyses and 45 mediational studies of the ACT literature as of Spring 2016. Most studies of ACT so far have been conducted on adults and therefore the knowledge of its effectiveness when applied to children and adolescents is limited. Similarities ACT, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and other acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches are commonly grouped under the name \\"the third wave of cognitive behavior therapy\\". The first wave, behaviour therapy, commenced in the 1920s based on Pavlov's classical (respondent) conditioning and operant conditioning that was correlated to reinforcing consequences. The second wave emerged in the 1970s and included cognition in the form of irrational beliefs, dysfunctional attitudes or depressogenic attributions.Leahy, R. L. (2004). Contemporary cognitive therapy: Theory, research, and practice. New York, NY: Guilford Press. In the late 1980s empirical limitations and philosophical misgivings of the second wave gave rise to Steven Hayes' ACT theory which modified the focus of abnormal behaviour away from the content or form towards the context in which it occurs. ACT research has suggested that many of the emotional defenses individuals use with conviction to try to solve their problems actually entangle humans into greater suffering. Rigid ideas about themselves, lack of focus on what is important in their life and struggling to change sensations, feelings or thoughts that are troublesome only serve to create greater distress.Hayes, S. C., & Smith, S. (2005). Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Santa Rosa, CA: New Harbinger Publications. Steven C. Hayes described this group in his ABCT President Address as follows: ACT has also been adapted to create a non-therapy version of the same processes called Acceptance and Commitment Training. This training process, oriented towards the development of mindfulness, acceptance, and valued skills in non-clinical settings such as businesses or schools, has also been investigated in a handful of research studies with good preliminary results.Hayes, S.C.; Bond, F.W.; Barnes-Holmes, D. & Austin, J. (2007). Acceptance And Mindfulness at Work: Applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy And Relational Frame Theory to Organizational Behavior Management. Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press. This is somewhat similar to the awareness‚Äìmanagement movement in business training programs, where mindfulness and cognitive- shifting techniques are employed. The emphasis of ACT on ongoing present moment awareness, valued directions and committed action is similar to other psycho-therapeutic approaches that, unlike ACT, are not as focused on outcome research or consciously linked to a basic behavioral science program, including approaches such as Gestalt therapy, Morita therapy and Voice Dialogue, IFS and others. Wilson, Hayes & Byrd explore at length the compatibilities between ACT and the 12-step treatment of addictions and argue that, unlike most other psychotherapies, both approaches can be implicitly or explicitly integrated due to their broad commonalities. Both approaches endorse acceptance as an alternative to unproductive control. ACT emphasizes the hopelessness of relying on ineffectual strategies to control private experience, similarly the 12-step approach emphasizes the acceptance of powerlessness over addiction. Both approaches encourage a broad life- reorientation, rather than a narrow focus on the elimination of substance use, and both place great value on the long-term project of building of a meaningful life aligned with the clients' values. ACT and 12-step both encourage the pragmatic utility of cultivating a transcendent sense of self (higher power) within an unconventional, individualized spirituality. Finally they both openly accept the paradox that acceptance is a necessary condition for change and both encourage a playful awareness of the limitations of human thinking. Criticisms Some published empirical studies in clinical psychology have argued that ACT is not different from other interventions. Stefan Hofmann argued that ACT is similar to the much older Morita therapy. A meta-analysis by √ñst in 2008 concluded that ACT did not yet qualify as an \\"empirically supported treatment\\", that the research methodology for ACT was less stringent than cognitive behavioral therapy, and that the mean effect size was moderate. Supporters of ACT have challenged those conclusions by showing that the quality difference in √ñst's review was accounted for by the larger number of funded trials in the CBT comparison group. Several concerns, both theoretical and empirical, have arisen in response to the ascendancy of ACT. One major theoretical concern was that the primary authors of ACT and of the corresponding theories of human behavior, relational frame theory (RFT) and functional contextualism (FC), recommended their approach as the proverbial holy grail of psychological therapies. Later, in the preface to the second edition of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, the authors clarified that \\"ACT has not been created to undercut the traditions from which it came, nor does it claim to be a panacea.\\" Psychologist James C. Coyne, in a discussion of \\"disappointments and embarrassments in the branding of psychotherapies as evidence supported\\", said: \\"Whether or not ACT is more efficacious than other therapies, as its proponents sometimes claim, or whether it is efficacious for psychosis, is debatable\\". The textbook Systems of Psychotherapy: A Transtheoretical Analysis provides criticisms of third- wave behaviour therapies including ACT from the perspectives of other systems of psychotherapy. Psychologist Jonathan W. Kanter said that Hayes and colleagues \\"argue that empirical clinical psychology is hampered in its efforts to alleviate human suffering and present contextual behavioral science (CBS) to address the basic philosophical, theoretical and methodological shortcomings of the field. CBS represents a host of good ideas but at times the promise of CBS is obscured by excessive promotion of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Relational Frame Theory (RFT) and demotion of earlier cognitive and behavior change techniques in the absence of clear logic and empirical support.\\" Nevertheless, Kanter concluded that \\"the ideas of CBS, RFT, and ACT deserve serious consideration by the mainstream community and have great potential to shape a truly progressive clinical science to guide clinical practice.\\" ACT currently appears to be about as effective as standard CBT, with some meta-analyses showing small differences in favor of ACT and others not. For example, a meta-analysis published by Francisco Ruiz in 2012 looked at 16 studies comparing ACT to standard CBT. ACT failed to separate from CBT on effect sizes for anxiety, however modest benefits were found with ACT compare to CBT for anxiety and quality of life. The author did find separation between ACT and CBT on the \\"primary outcome\\" ‚Äì a heterogeneous class of 14 separate outcome measures that were aggregated into the effect size analysis. This analysis however is limited by the highly heterogeneous nature of the outcome variables used in the analysis, which has the tendency to increase the number needed to treat (NNT) to replicate the effect size reported. More limited measures, such as depression, anxiety and quality of life decrease the NNT, making the analysis more clinically relevant, and on these measures ACT did not outperform CBT. A 2013 paper comparing ACT to cognitive therapy (CT) concluded that \\"like CT, ACT cannot yet make strong claims that its unique and theory-driven intervention components are active ingredients in its effects.\\" The authors of the paper suggested that many of the assumptions of ACT and CT \\"are pre-analytical, and cannot be directly pitted against one another in experimental tests.\\" Professional organizations The Association for Contextual Behavioral Science is committed to research and development in the area of ACT, RFT, and contextual behavioral science more generally. As of 2017 it had over 7,600 members worldwide, about half outside of the United States. It holds annual \\"world conference\\" meetings: The 16th will be held in Montreal, in July 2018. The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis ABA:I. ABAI has larger special interest groups for autism and behavioral medicine. ABAI serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts. ABAI sponsors three conferences/year‚Äîone multi-track in the U.S., one specific to Autism and one international. The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) also has an interest group in behavior analysis, which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. ACT work is commonly presented at ABCT and other mainstream CBT organizations. The British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) has a large special interest group in ACT, with over 1,200 members. Doctoral-level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the American Psychological Association's (APA) Division 25‚ÄîBehavior analysis. ACT has been called a \\"commonly used treatment with empirical support\\" within the APA-recognized specialty of behavioral and cognitive psychology.

He adopted the stage name of his stepfather, actor Eugene Santley. Life and career Joseph Santley (center) in Irving Berlin's Stop! Look! Listen! (1915) Joseph Santley was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. As a boy, he and older brother Fred began performing in live theatre appearing in summer stock and touring with their parents. In 1906, at age seventeen, Joseph Santley co-wrote and starred on Broadway in the play, Billy the Kid. In 1907, he acted in film for the first time for Sidney Olcott at the Kalem Company in a silent Western film short called Pony Express. Santley continued to work almost exclusively in musical comedy plays, returning to Broadway five more times as well as touring nationally. A gifted dancer, Santley created the Santley Tango and the Hawaiian Butterfly. After he married actress/singer and cabaret dancer Ivy Sawyer, beginning in 1916 the two danced as a team, performing together in a number of Broadway musicals beginning with Betty and Oh, My Dear! and eventually other productions at major venues across the United States such as the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.. Their final collective Broadway presentation was in 1927's Just Fancy which Santley co-wrote, produced and directed. He and Ivy Sawyer had a son Joseph born in 1916 and a daughter Betty born in 1928. In 1928, Santley directed his first motion picture, a short talkie for Paramount Pictures that featured singer Ruth Etting. The next year, Paramount had Santley direct three more films that were short singing productions, one with Etting, another with crooner Rudy Vallee, plus a third titled High Hat with Broadway singing star Alice Boulden. Also, he directed A Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic, a musical film featuring Eddie Cantor along with Eddie Elkins and his orchestra. In 1929, Joseph Santley co-directed, with Robert Florey, the first Marx Brothers feature film The Cocoanuts, a musical comedy for which he is most famous. Based on the George S. Kaufman play, and with music by Irving Berlin, the film was billed as \\"Paramount's All Talking- Singing Musical Comedy Hit.\\" His other notable directorial efforts include 1935's Harmony Lane, a biographical musical on the life of composer Stephen Foster. In 1940, he directed Melody Ranch starring \\"singing cowboy\\" Gene Autry. The film has been deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. During World War II, Joseph Santley worked for the war effort and in 1942 made the film Remember Pearl Harbor. In 1950, he made his last feature film but came back at age sixty-five to produce the 1954-55 television comedy The Mickey Rooney Show. In 1956, he put together two segments of Jazz Ball, a made-for-TV musical revue created from various filmed performances by jazz greats from the 1930s to the 1950s.

The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN B00D959PJ0 Though the Greek drak≈çn often differs from the modern Western conception of a dragon, it is both the etymological origin of the modern term and the source of many surviving Indo-European myths and legends about dragons. Origins The word dragon derives from the Greek Œ¥œÅŒ¨Œ∫œâŒΩ (drak≈çn) and its Latin cognate draco. Ancient Greeks applied the term to large, constricting snakes. The Greek drak≈çn was far more associated with poisonous spit or breath than the modern Western dragon, though fiery breath is still attested in a few myths. There is also the dracaena or drakaina, the specifically female form or \\"she-dragon.\\" The drakaina is occasionally treated differently from the more common masculine or gender-neutral drak≈çn, often surviving by mating with a hero or being the ancestress of an important lineage.https://www.theoi.com/Ther/DrakainaSkythia.html Daniel Ogden speaks of three ways to explain the origins of Greek dragon myths: as vertical evolution from (reconstructed) Proto-Indo-European mythology, as horizontal adaptation from Ancient Near Eastern mythology, or as sitting within \\"the cloud of international folktale\\". Regarding theories of vertical transmission, Ogden argues that they carry \\"an unspoken assumption that prior to such a transfer the Greeks' own myth-world was a tabula rasa\\", which he calls absurd; only Typhon's Near Eastern origins are, in his view, plausible. List of dragons =Typhon= Typhon was the most fearsome monster of Greek mythology. The last son of Gaia, Typhon was, with his mate Echidna, the father of many other monsters. He is usually envisioned as humanoid from the waist up, serpentine below. =Ladon= Mosaic of the third century BC from Kaulon (alt=Mosaico del III secolo a.C. proveniente da Kaulon Ladon was the serpent-like drakon (dragon, a word more commonly used) that twined round the tree in the Garden of the Hesperides and guarded the golden apples. Ladon was also said to have as many as one hundred heads. He was overcome and possibly slain by Heracles. After a few years, the Argonauts passed by the same spot, on their chthonic return journey from Colchis at the opposite end of the world, and heard the lament of \\"shining\\" Aigle, one of the Hesperides, and viewed the still- twitching Ladon (Argonautica, book iv). The creature is associated with the constellation Draco. Ladon was given several parentages, each of which placed him at an archaic level in Greek myth: the offspring of \\"Ceto, joined in love with Phorcys\\" (Hesiod, Theogony 333) or of Typhon, who was himself serpent- like from the waist down, and Echidna (Bibliotheke 2.113; Hyginus, Preface to Fabulae) or of Gaia herself, or in her Olympian manifestation, Hera: \\"The Dragon which guarded the golden apples was the brother of the Nemean lion\\" asserted Ptolemy Hephaestion (recorded in his New History V, lost but epitomized in Photius, Myriobiblion 190). =Lernaean Hydra= The Lernaean Hydra was a dragon-like water serpent with fatally venomous breath, blood and fangs, a daughter of Typhon and Echidna. The creature was said to have anywhere between five and 100 heads, although most sources put the number somewhere between seven and nine. For each head cut off, one or two more grew back in its place. It had an immortal head which would remain alive after it was cut off. Some accounts claim that the immortal head was made of gold. It lived in a swamp near Lerna and frequently terrorized the townsfolk until it was slain by Heracles, who cut the heads off, with the help of his nephew Iolaus, who then singed the oozing stump with a blazing firebrand to prevent any new heads from growing, as the second of his Twelve Labors. Hera sent a giant crab to distract Heracles, but he simply crushed it under his foot. Hera then placed it in the heavens as the constellation Cancer. After slaying the serpent, Heracles buried the immortal head under a rock and dipped his arrows in the creature's blood to make them fatal to his enemies. In one version, the poisoned arrows would eventually prove to be the undoing of his centaur tutor Chiron, who was placed in the heavens as the constellation Centaurus. =Pytho or Python= In Greek mythology Python was the earth-dragon of Delphi, always represented in the vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Various myths represented Python as being either male or female (a drakaina). Python was the chthonic enemy of Apollo, who slew it and remade its former home his own oracle, the most famous in Greece. There are various versions of Python's birth and death at the hands of Apollo. In the earliest, the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, little detail is given about Apollo's combat with the serpent or its parentage. The version related by HyginusFabulae 140. holds that when Zeus lay with the goddess Leto, and she was to deliver Artemis and Apollo, Hera sent Python to pursue her throughout the lands, so that she could not be delivered wherever the sun shone. Thus when the infant was grown he pursued the python, making his way straight for Mount Parnassus where the serpent dwelled, and chased it to the oracle of Gaia at Delphi, and dared to penetrate the sacred precinct and kill it with his arrows beside the rock cleft where the priestess sat on her tripod. The priestess of the oracle at Delphi became known as the Pythia, after the place-name Pytho, which was named after the rotting (œÄœçŒ∏ŒµŒπŒΩ) of the serpent's corpse after it was slain. =The Colchian dragon= Known as Drak√¥n Kolkhikos, (, , Dragon of Colchis) this immense serpent, a child of Typhon and Echidna, guarded the Golden Fleece at Colchis.\\"A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\\" It was said to never sleep, rest, or lower its vigilance. According to Ovid's Metamorphoses, the monster had a crest and three tongues. When Jason went to retrieve the Fleece, the witch Medea put the dragon to sleep with her magic and drugs, or perhaps Orpheus lulled it to sleep with his lyre. Afterwards, Medea herself had dragons pull her chariot. =The Ismenian dragon= The Ismenian Serpent, of the spring of Ismene at Thebes, Greece, was slain by the hero Cadmus.Theoi.com: Drakon Ismenios; excerpts of Greek myth in translation. It was the offspring of Ares, who later turned the hero into a serpent.Maehly, J., Die Schlange im Mythus und Cultus der classischen Voelker, publ. Buchdruckerei von C. Schultze, Baseln, 1867. =Helios' dragons= Dragon-chariot of Medea, Lucanian red- figure krater C4th BC, Cleveland Museum of Art According to Apollodorus, the sun god Helios had a chariot, drawn by \\"winged dragons\\", which he gave to his granddaughter Medea.Apollodorus, 1.9.28. =Scythian Dracaena= She was a woman from the waist up with a serpent's tail in place of legs. When Heracles was traveling through Scythia with the cattle of Geryon, she stole some of the herd when the hero was sleeping. When Heracles woke searched for them, visiting every part of the country, and he came to the land called the Hylaea (), and there he found in a cave the creature, which was the queen of that country. She insisted the hero mate with her before she would return them. He did so and through her became the ancestor of an ancient line of Scythian kings.Herodotus Histories 4.8.3 - 4.10.3 It may have identified with the Echidna. =Gigantomachian Dragon= A dragon that was thrown at Athena during the Gigantomachy.

Farry was forced to leave that post due to a dispute with Celtic over the registration of player Jorge Cadete. Early life Farry attended school in East Kilbride, before working as a landscape gardener, milkman and window cleaner. He first joined the Scottish Football Association (SFA) in 1972 as an administration assistant. In the late 1970s he was appointed secretary of the Scottish Football League, a position he held for over 10 years. Farry earned a reputation as an efficient administrator during his stint as league secretary. When the same position at the SFA became vacant in 1990, he was appointed as the successor to the departing Ernie Walker. SFA chief executive While chief executive, Farry oversaw the project to renovate Scotland's national football stadium Hampden Park. The 'new Hampden' as it was termed, drew both support and criticism, with opinion divided over the need for a dedicated national stadium within Scotland. As the stadium is used at club level by Queen's Park, an amateur team currently playing in the lower divisions and possessing limited support, some footballing figures had argued that an existing stadium could have served as a home for the Scottish national team indefinitely. Alternatively, supporters of the stadium have pointed to the awarding of UEFA elite status and the hosting of a number of high-profile matches, most notably the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final and the 2007 UEFA Cup Final, as proof of the renovation's success. =Princess of Wales Controversy= In 1997, Farry attracted criticism from some parts of the media in the aftermath of the death of Diana Princess of Wales, after he publicly rejected calls to cancel a scheduled international match between Scotland and Belarus on the day of the Princess's funeral. He later revealed that he had been advised by Buckingham Palace to let the game go ahead; however after a hostile reaction from the media and certain sections of society, the match was eventually rescheduled. Labour MP Jimmy Hood and the Daily Record newspaper called on Farry to resign, while Rangers players Ally McCoist, Andy Goram and Gordon Durie had refused to play in the match if it had been played on the day of the funeral. =Jorge Cadete= In 1999, an independent commission was called to examine allegations made by the then Celtic managing director and majority shareholder Fergus McCann concerning the registration of Portuguese player Jorge Cadete in 1996. A player must be registered with the SFA before he is permitted to play in matches in Scotland. A delay in the registration had forced Cadete to miss a Scottish Cup semi-final against their Old Firm rivals Rangers, which Celtic lost 2-1. McCann claimed that the delay was deliberate and the commission ruled in his favour. On 8 March 1999, Farry was sacked for gross misconduct. Life after football As of 2009, Farry was employed as a business development manager by medium-sized construction and refurbishment firm AKP Scotland, based in East Kilbride. He was also a patron of Cambuslang Rugby Club. Following a massive heart attack in his home in Cambuslang, Farry died on 10 November 2010 in Hairmyres Hospital, East Kilbride, shortly afterwards. He was survived by his wife and two children.

An ear tag is a plastic or metal object used for identification of domestic livestock and other animals. If the ear tag uses Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) technology it is referred to as an electronic ear tag. Electronic ear tags conform to international standards ISO 11784 and ISO 11785 working at 134.2 kHz, as well as ISO/IEC 18000-6C operating in the UHF spectrum. There are other non-standard systems such as Destron working at 125 kHz. Although there are many shapes of ear tags, the main types in current use are as follows: * Flag-shaped ear tag: two discs joined through the ear, one or both bearing a wide, flat plastic surface on which identification details are written or printed in large, easily legible script. * Button-shaped ear tag: two discs joined through the ear. * Plastic clip ear tag: a moulded plastic strip, folded over the edge of the ear and joined through it. * Metal ear tag: an aluminium, steel or brass rectangle with sharp points, clipped over the edge of the ear, with the identification stamped into it. * Electronic Identification Tags, include the EID number and sometimes a management number on the button that appears on the back of the ear. These can at times be combined as a matched set, which includes Visual tags with Electronic Identification Tags. Each of these except the metal type may carry a RFID chip, which normally carries an electronic version of the same identification number. Overview An ear tag usually carries an Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non electronic ear tags may be simply handwritten for the convenience of the farmer (these are known as \\"management tags\\"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identification Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device in the form of an ear tag or rumen bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen)Rumen bolus system pays off , Queensland Country Life. Retrieved: 2010-08-14.Ruminal bolus Prionics Italia. Retrieved: 2010-08-14. before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an ear tag that has the Property Identification Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each bovine animal having a passport document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an anklet). An ear tag can be applied with an ear tag applicator, however there are also specially- designed tags that can be applied by hand. Depending on the purpose of the tagging, an animal may be tagged on one ear or both. There may be requirements for the placement of ear tags, and care must be taken to ensure they are not placed too close to the edge of the ear pinnae; which may leave the tag vulnerable to being ripped out accidentally. If there exists a national animal identification programme in a country, animals may be tagged on both ears for the sake of increased security and effectiveness, or as a legal requirement. If animals are tagged for private purposes, usually one ear is tagged. Australian sheep and goats are required to have visually readable ear tags printed with a Property Identification Code (PIC). They are complemented by movement documents supplied by consignors that are used for identification and tracking. Very small ear tags are available for laboratory animals such as mice and rats. They are usually sold with a device that pierces the animal's ear and installs the tag at the same time. Lab animals can also be identified by other methods such as ear punching or marking (also used for livestock; see below), implanted RFID tags (mice are too small to wear an ear tag containing an RFID chip), and dye.  History  thumb A tagged thumb Livestock ear tags were developed in 1799 under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society, for identification of Merino sheep in the flock established for King George III. Matthew Boulton designed and produced the first batch of sheep eartags, and produced subsequent batches, modified according to suggestions received from Banks. The first tags were made of tin.Carter, H. B. 1964. His Majesty's Spanish flock. Angus and Robertson, Sydney. 520 pp. Ear tags were incorporated as breed identification in the United States with the forming of the International Ohio Improved Chester Association as early as 1895, and stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation, as an association animal and breed identification, of the improved Chester White. Although ear tags were developed in Canada as early as 1913 as a means to identify cattle when testing for tuberculosis, the significant increase of use of ear tags appeared with the outbreak of BSE in UK. Today, ear tags in a variety of designs are used throughout the world on many species of animal to ensure traceability, to help prevent theft and to control disease outbreaks. The first ear tags were primarily steel with nickel plating. After World War II, larger, flag-like, plastic tags were developed in the United States. Designed to be visible from a distance, these were applied by cutting a slit in the ear and slipping the arrow-shaped head of the tag through it so that the flag would hang from the ear. In 1953, the first two-piece, self-piercing plastic ear tag was developed and patented. This tag, which combined the easy application of metal tags with the visibility and colour options of plastic tags, also limited the transfer of blood-borne diseases between animals during the application process. Some cattle ear tags contain chemicals to repel insects, such as buffalo flies, horseflies, etc. Metal ear tags are used to identify the date of regulation shearing of stud and show sheep. Today, a large number of manufacturers are in competition for the identification of world livestock population . In 2004, the U.S. Government asked farmers to use EID or Electronic Identification ear tags on all their cattle. This request was part of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) spurred by the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Due to poor performance and concern that other people could access their confidential information, only about 30 percent of cattle producers in the United States tried using EID tags using standards based on the low frequency standards, while the UHF standards are being mandated for use in Brazil, Paraguay, and Korea .EID Tags - The Next Generation , CattleIdentification.org The United States Department of Agriculture maintains a list of manufacturers approved to sell ear tags in the USA. Ear tags (conventional and electronic) are used in the EU as official ID system for cattle, sheep and goat, in some cases combined with RFID devices The International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) controls the issue electronic tag numbers under ISO regulation 11784. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) is Australia's system for tracing cattle, sheep and goats from birth to slaughter. In Canada, the Health of Animals Regulations require approved ear tags on all bison, cattle and sheep that leave the farm of origin, except that a bovine may be moved, without a tag, from the farm of origin to a tagging site.Canada. Health of Animals Regulations, CRC, c296, Part XV. RFID (radio frequency identification) tags are used for cattle in Canada and metal as well as RFID tags have been in use for sheep. Mandatory RFID tagging of sheep in Canada (which was previously scheduled to take effect January 1, 2013) will be deferred to some later date. Other forms of animal identification Pigs, cattle and sheep are frequently earmarked with pliers that notch registered owner and/or age marks into the ear. Mares on large horse breeding farms have a plastic tag attached to a neck strap for identification; which preserves their ears free of notches. Dairy cows are sometimes identified with ratchet fastened plastic anklets fitted on the pastern for ready inspection during milking; however NLIS requirements apply to cattle - including both dairy and beef animals. More commonly coloured electrical tape is used as short term ankle identifiers for dairy animals to identify when one teat should not be milked for any reason. Laboratory rodents are often marked with ear tags, ear notches or implantable microchips.

In this role, he was in charge of administration and uniformed operations and also carried the courtesy title of Deputy Commissioner. Royds was born in Rochdale, Lancashire. He attended Eastman's Royal Naval Academy in Southsea and became a Naval Cadet in HMS Conway in June 1892. In August 1892, he went to sea in the cruiser HMS Immortalit√© of the Channel Squadron. As a Midshipman, he served in the cruisers HMS Australia and HMS Barfleur. In September 1896, he was commissioned as a Sub-Lieutenant. In 1897, he was appointed to the cruiser HMS Champion in the Training Squadron. In 1898, he received early promotion to lieutenant for his skilled command of a boat that picked up a man who had fallen overboard in the Baltic. In 1899 he sailed to the West Indies aboard HMS Crescent. From 1901 to 1904, Royds was First Lieutenant of the RRS Discovery on Robert Falcon Scott's National Antarctic Expedition. Cape Royds in Antarctica was named after him. He then joined the battleship HMS Bulwark in the Mediterranean, and in 1907 transferred to HMS King Edward VII in the Channel Fleet. In June 1909 he became executive officer in the rank of commander. In January 1911, he became the first Executive Officer of the battleship HMS Hercules, and in August 1913 transferred to the same post in HMS Iron Duke, another new battleship and flagship of Admiral Jellicoe. On 31 December 1914, Royds was promoted to captain and became Flag Captain to Admiral Sir Stanley Colville, commanding Orkney and Shetland. Six months later he was given command of the battleship HMS Emperor of India. He remained in her until January 1919, and was appointed Companion of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 3 June 1919 for his war service. He served at Dover for a time and then was the last captain of the Royal Naval College, Osborne, from 2 January 1921 until its closure in May 1921. He then became Director of Physical Training and Sports at the Admiralty, from 17 May 1921, succeeding his elder brother, Percy (himself later an admiral). From October 1923 to 15 October 1925, he was Commodore of the Royal Naval Barracks at Devonport, his last naval appointment. On 1 January 1926, he succeeded Sir James Olive as Assistant Commissioner \\"A\\" and Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. In March 1926, he retired from the Royal Navy on promotion to rear-admiral. On 3 June 1929, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Metropolitan Police Centenary Honours, and in the same year was made an ADC to the King. On 23 May 1930, he was promoted to Vice-Admiral on the Retired List. Royds died suddenly while still in office as Assistant Commissioner, and while acting as Commissioner during General Byng's absence on sick leave. He suffered a heart attack while attending a rehearsal of the Strauss Ball at the Savoy Hotel and was rushed to Charing Cross Hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Royds was a very large man, standing well over six feet tall. In 1918, he married the widowed Mary Louisa Blane, a former actress. They had a daughter named Minna Mary Jessica Royds.

The larger wheels enabled them to be used on both passenger and freight trains, although at the expense of a lower tractive effort. As a result they were given the BR power classification 4P/5F, rather than the 6F of the earlier class. A total of 289 examples were built over the next fifteen years.

Other varieties such as Halls contain menthol, peppermint oil and/or spearmint as their active ingredient(s). Honey lozenges are also available. The purpose of the throat lozenge is to calm the irritation that may be felt in the throat while swallowing, breathing, or even drinking certain fluids. History Candies to soothe the throat date back to 1000 BC in Egypt's Twentieth Dynasty, when they were made from honey flavored with citrus, herbs, and spices. In the 19th century, physicians discovered morphine and heroin, which suppress coughing at its source‚Äîthe brain.

Coastal Pet Rescue (or CPR) is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to saving the lives of homeless, abused and neglected animals in the coastal areas of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida. Its goal is to save as many pet lives as possible through rescue, reduce pet overpopulation through spaying/neutering, and to provide opportunities to the public to become better pet guardians. History Coastal Pet Rescue was founded in Savannah, Georgia on February 5, 2003 by Lisa Scarbrough. Scarbrough had been rescuing and placing pets on her own for two years. She decided to formalize her rescue effort so that she could enlist the assistance of others and do more. Today, Coastal Pet Rescue employs a non- paid executive committee of five that oversee nearly 60 active volunteers. Awards and recognition In 2005, the organization received multiple recognitions for its work. In February, the Savannah Morning News ran a featured article about Coastal Pet Rescue and its founder, Lisa Scarbrough. The reporter noted the rescue's biggest case at the time. Jackie, a female Weimaraner, had been hit by a semi truck and then left abandoned in an apartment for two weeks without any care. Coastal Pet Rescue took her and her companion, a male Weimaraner they dubbed \\"Colby\\" after the runner-up in the second season of Survivor, in to their care. Lacking proper funds for Jackie's much needed orthopedic care, the organization appealed to the public and raised over the needed amount. The story caught the eye of a local Lexus and Toyota dealership's general manager, who offered to support the agency through donations for each purchase of vehicles from two lots through one month. This led to their appearance in TIME Magazine in August as the dealership was rewarded with the Toyota President's Award for their community support. Using the funds garnered from the dealership's support, Coastal Pet Rescue purchased and donated manikins and supplies in May to the Savannah Chapter of the American Red Cross so that pet first aid and CPR classes could be offered in the area. Continually striving to provide resources and support for animals in the community, the organization launched a trap-neuter-return program for feral cats in July. Dubbed The Milton Project, the program seeks to control the overpopulation of feral colonies around the Savannah area. Program coordinator Mandy Ownley works with a local vet to provide low-cost spays/neuters and rabies vaccinations to the cats and kittens that are trapped. Those that are young enough to be socialized are placed for adoption. Looking to increase their humane education in the area, Coastal Pet Rescue launched its CPR Teens program in August. CPR Teens is a teen volunteer initiative to educate teens on the proper care for animals and deter tendencies towards animal cruelty. In September, founder Lisa Scarbrough was recognized nationally for her dedication to homeless pets. Jiffy Lube named her its national Hearts on Wheels winner. Lisa was flown to New York to appear on morning talk and radio shows around the nation. Afterwards, she was treated to an afternoon with the ASPCA, including time with Annemarie Lucas, notable from Animal Planet's Animal Precinct. Also that month, Lisa was granted a scholarship from Humane Society University towards her bachelor of science in humane leadership program from Duquesne University. Rounding out a month of awards, the story of Jackie was featured in the very first worldwide edition of Celebrate Animals. Celebrate Animals is a newsletter produced by Smarter than Jack, which features news of animal rescues and heart-warming stories. Back home, the group collaborated with SPOT (Stopping Pet Overpopulation Together), an agency out of Atlanta, Georgia, to organize a two-day mobile spay/neuter clinic in Savannah. The group serviced 22 cats and several dogs. Founder Lisa Scarbrough was recognized again for her local work as a finalist for the Humane Society of Chatham-Savannah's Maggy Medallion. In October, Purina named Coastal Pet Rescue to its Purina Pro Plan Rally to Rescue Ambassador program. The group was only one of three in Georgia selected. Purina provided event materials, including its own 10x10 tent, curb signs and fundraising items as well as packages for adopters. December found the organization on CNN.com in a segment focusing on how the Internet has changed people's lives. Lisa's hometown publication, the Tybee Breeze, also ran a three-page article about the success of the organization for the last year. Founder Lisa Scarbrough spent much of 2005 promoting her agency and raising awareness for homeless animals. She was a regular guest on WTGS Fox Newsmakers and WJCL Call 22, and the organization's website was selected as Winner Best of Savannah for Web Design by Connect Savannah. Thanks to the dedication and promotion by the volunteers of Coastal Pet Rescue, 143 pets were rescued, of which 114 found new homes. The group was propelled to national attention again in 2006 with recognition by Purina. Rally to Rescue chose to honor ten of its over 500 ambassadors in May in Washington, DC, one of which was Coastal Pet Rescue. The honorees received an Award of Excellence from Purina, special recognition from the United States Department of Agriculture, and had flags flown over the capital in their honor. Sex in the City actress Kristin Davis gave the address at the National Press Room. Coastal Pet Rescue founder and president Lisa Scarbrough received additional recognition in July as she was named to the REAL Hot 100 list. The REAL hot 100 is a list featuring young women from around the country who are breaking barriers, fighting stereotypes, and making a difference in their communities or the nation.

He moved to London to pursue an education in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.Jean-Marc Barr at franceinter.frAn Interview with the Fabulous Jean-Marc Barr , Beachcomber, 16 January 2014 Barr began working in theatre in France in 1986. After finding work in television (including a small role in Hotel du Lac (1986), the BBC's version of the Booker prize-winning novel by Anita Brookner), and film, (in particular Hope and Glory (1987) by John Boorman), he was cast in the tremendously successful The Big Blue (1988). Luc Besson cast him in the role of French diver Jacques Mayol, alongside Rosanna Arquette and Jean Reno. The Big Blue was the most financially successful film in France in the 1980s. In 1991, Barr starred in Danish director Lars von Trier's Europa, marking the beginning of a long friendship (he is the godfather of von Trier's children) as well as a significant professional relationship. He went on to appear in von Trier's Breaking the Waves (1996), Dancer in the Dark (2000), Dogville (2004), Manderlay (2005), The Boss of It All (2006) and Nymph()maniac (2013).

The prokaryotic cell is shown with its DNA, in green. 2. The bacteriophage attaches and releases its DNA, shown in red, into the prokaryotic cell. 3. The phage DNA then moves through the cell to the host‚Äôs DNA. 4. The phage DNA integrates itself into the host cell's DNA, creating prophage. 5. The prophage then remains dormant until the host cell divides. 6. After the host cell has divided, the phage DNA in the daughter cells activate, and the phage DNA begins to express itself. Some of the cells containing the prophage go on to create new phages which will move on to infect other cells. Lysogeny, or the lysogenic cycle, is one of two cycles of viral reproduction (the lytic cycle being the other). Lysogeny is characterized by integration of the bacteriophage nucleic acid into the host bacterium's genome or formation of a circular replicon in the bacterial cytoplasm. In this condition the bacterium continues to live and reproduce normally. The genetic material of the bacteriophage, called a prophage, can be transmitted to daughter cells at each subsequent cell division, and at later events (such as UV radiation or the presence of certain chemicals) can release it, causing proliferation of new phages via the lytic cycle. Lysogenic cycles can also occur in eukaryotes, although the method of DNA incorporation is not fully understood. The difference between lysogenic and lytic cycles is that, in lysogenic cycles, the spread of the viral DNA occurs through the usual prokaryotic reproduction, whereas a lytic cycle is more immediate in that it results in many copies of the virus being created very quickly and the cell is destroyed. One key difference between the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle is that the lysogenic cycle does not lyse the host cell straight away. Phages that replicate only via the lytic cycle are known as virulent phages while phages that replicate using both lytic and lysogenic cycles are known as temperate phages. In the lysogenic cycle, the phage DNA first integrates into the bacterial chromosome to produce the prophage. When the bacterium reproduces, the prophage is also copied and is present in each of the daughter cells. The daughter cells can continue to replicate with the prophage present or the prophage can exit the bacterial chromosome to initiate the lytic cycle. In lysogenic cycle the host DNA is not hydrolysed but in lytic cycle the host DNA is hydrolysed in the lytic phase. Bacteriophages Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and replicate within a bacterium. Temperate phages (such as lambda phage) can reproduce using both the lytic and the lysogenic cycle. Via the lysogenic cycle, the bacteriophage's genome is not expressed and is instead integrated into the bacteria's genome to form the prophage. Since the bacteriophage's genetic information is incorporated into the bacteria's genetic information as a prophage, the bacteriophage replicates passively as the bacterium divides to form daughter bacteria cells. In this scenario, the daughter bacteria cells contain prophage and are known as lysogens. Lysogens can remain in the lysogenic cycle for many generations but can switch to the lytic cycle at any time via a process known as induction. During induction, prophage DNA is excised from the bacterial genome and is transcribed and translated to make coat proteins for the virus and regulate lytic growth. The model organism for studying lysogeny is lambda phage. Prophage integration, maintenance of lysogeny, induction, and control of phage genome excision in induction is described in detail in the lambda phage article. = Fitness tradeoffs for bacteria = Bacteriophages are parasitic because they infect their hosts, use bacterial machinery to replicate, and ultimately lyse the bacteria. Temperate phages can lead to both advantages and disadvantages for their hosts via the lysogenic cycle. During the lysogenic cycle, the virus genome is incorporated as prophage and a repressor prevents viral replication. Nonetheless, a temperate phage can escape repression to replicate, produce viral particles, and lyse the bacteria. The temperate phage escaping repression would be a disadvantage for the bacteria. On the other hand, the prophage may transfer genes that enhance host virulence and resistance to the immune system. Also, the repressor produced by the prophage that prevents prophage genes from being expressed confers an immunity for the host bacteria from lytic infection by related viruses. Another system, arbitrium, has recently been described for bacteriophages infecting several Bacillus species, in which the decision between lysis and lysogeny is transmitted between bacteria by a peptide factor. Stokar-Avihail A, Tal N, Erez Z, Lopatina A, Sorek R. Widespread Utilization of Peptide Communication in Phages Infecting Soil and Pathogenic Bacteria. Cell host & microbe. 2019 May 8;25(5):746-55. = Lysogenic conversion = In some interactions between lysogenic phages and bacteria, lysogenic conversion may occur, which can also be called phage conversion. It is when a temperate phage induces a change in the phenotype of the infected bacteria that is not part of a usual phage cycle. Changes can often involve the external membrane of the cell by making it impervious to other phages or even by increasing the pathogenic capability of the bacteria for a host. In this way, temperate bacteriophages also play a role in the spread of virulence factors, such as exotoxins and exoenzymes, amongst bacteria. This change then stays in the genome of the infected bacteria and is copied and passed down to daughter cells.  Bacterial survival  Lysogenic conversion has shown to enable biofilm formation in Bacillus anthracis Strains of B. anthracis cured of all phage were unable to form biofilms, which are surface-adhered bacterial communities that enable bacteria to better access nutrients and survive environmental stresses. In addition to biofilm formation in B. anthracis, lysogenic conversion of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus cereus has shown an enhanced rate or extent of sporulation. Sporulation produces endospores, which are metabolically dormant forms of the bacteria that are highly resistant to temperature, ionizing radiation, desiccation, antibiotics, and disinfectants.  Bacterial virulence  Non-virulent bacteria have also been shown to transform into highly virulent pathogens through lysogenic conversion with the virulence factors carried on the lysogenic prophage. Virulence genes carried within prophages as discrete autonomous genetic elements, known as morons, confer an advantage to the bacteria that indirectly benefits the virus through enhanced lysogen survival. Examples: * Corynebacterium diphtheriae produces the toxin of diphtheria only when it is infected by the phage Œ≤. In this case, the gene that codes for the toxin is carried by the phage, not the bacterium. * Vibrio cholerae is a non-toxic strain that can become toxic, producing cholera toxin, when it is infected with the phage CTXœÜ. * Shigella dysenteriae, which produces dysentery has toxins that fall into two major groups, Stx1 and Stx2, whose genes are considered to be part of the genome of lambdoid prophages. * Streptococcus pyogenes, produce a pyrogenic exotoxin, obtained by lysogenic conversion, which causes fever and a scarlet-red rash, scarlet fever. * Certain strains of Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism, express botulinum toxin from phage-tranduced genes.  Preventing lysogenic induction  Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by blocking prophage induction (the transition from the lytic cycle to the lysogenic cycle) by eliminating in vivo induction agents have been proposed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, are strong oxidizing agents that can decompose into free radicals and cause DNA damage to bacteria, which prevents prophage induction. One potential strategy to combat prophage induction is through the use of glutathione, a strong antioxidant that can remove free radical intermediates. Another approach could be to cause an overexpression of CI repressor since prophage induction only occurs when the concentration of CI repressor is too low.

It was set up by Alan Moore in 1999 as an imprint of WildStorm, an idea proposed to Moore by WildStorm founder Jim Lee when it was still under Image Comics. History Alex Ross' cover to America's Best Comics 64 Page Giant, featuring many of the characters created by Alan Moore for the imprint. America's Best Comics was a prominent Standard/Better/Nedor title during the 1940s Golden Age of comic books, starring such heroes as the Black Terror and the Fighting Yank. Those characters were integrated into the Moore version under the ABC imprint, where Moore wrote series including The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a strip which merged several famous Victorian era fiction characters into one world; Tom Strong, an homage to pulp fiction heroes such as Tarzan and Doc Savage; Top 10, a police procedural set in a police precinct in a city where everyone has superpowers or is a costumed adventurer; and Promethea, one of Moore's most personal pieces which detailed his view on magic. Peter Hogan and Rick Veitch had their own spin-off series, Terra Obscura and Greyshirt: Indigo Sunset respectively, and Steve Moore (no relation) co-wrote Tom Strong's Terrific Tales with Moore. Regular contributing artists include Kevin O'Neill, Chris Sprouse, Rick Veitch, J. H. Williams III, Gene Ha, Zander Cannon, Kevin Nowlan, Hilary Barta, Melinda Gebbie, Jim Baikie, Yanick Paquette, and Art Adams. All the lettering for the ABC line was done by Todd Klein, with the exception of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which was handled by Bill Oakley. The logo of ABC is mainly based on an idea from Alex Ross and was also done by Todd Klein. In August 1998 Jim Lee sold the WildStorm company to DC Comics, unaware that due to past conflicts over the Watchmen copyright in the 1980s Alan Moore had vowed never to work for the publisher again. According to the interview Moore gave George Khoury in the book The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore, when Lee first saw Alan Moore after the takeover, the tall figure of Moore holding his snake-headed walking stick impressed Lee so, he was sure Moore - who was then still ignorant of the sale - was going to beat him senseless. Moore was reluctant at first, but ultimately decided to accept his new situation as he had promised work to a number of his artist friends from Rob Liefeld's defunct Awesome Comics line. In the same interview, he said that it was better to go back against a principle for the greater good, than to have no principles in life at all. He also expressed interest in eventually ending the line with a little apocalypse. Deliberately and permanently ending an entire comic line was something he felt had never been done before in comics. Moore brought an end to the ABC Universe towards the conclusion of Promethea when she ushers in the apocalypse. Moore wrote the last issue of Tom Strong and two 64-page Tomorrow Stories specials offering a final farewell to most of ABC's characters. Before those final stories, the ABC line continued a little while longer under other writers. Tom Strong, for example, had been written entirely by guest authors since November 2003. These authors have included; Peter Hogan, Geoff Johns, Mark Schultz, Steve Aylett, Brian K. Vaughan, Ed Brubaker and Michael Moorcock. A sequel to Top 10 called Beyond The Farthest Precinct has been penned by novelist Paul Di Filippo and artist Jerry Ordway and another title, written by Peter Hogan and Steve Moore, was going to explore the remaining secrets of all of the major ABC characters. This mini-series, America's Best Comics: A to Z, started in September 2005 but was cancelled after four issues.

It planned to reveal secrets and unknown facts about the characters that have appeared thus far in the ABC line. The miniseries was canceled after issue #4. Work had begun on issue #5, but its unclear how complete it was before the plug was pulled. There are no plans at present to publish a collection of the issues.

He studied medicine at Howard University in the United States and later the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. After qualifying, he returned to the United States for further studies and became a visiting ophthalmic surgeon to Harlem Hospital in New York City. He returned to Barbados in 1953, and became successful and highly regarded as a medical practitioner. He established a nursing home, which is known as Woodside Memorial Clinic, and which he continued to run until he became Governor- General. He had a distinguished record in community work and gave his services without charge to the Children's Goodwill League, as well as lecturing in public health. From time to time he taught hygiene to the pupils of some of the primary schools in the Bridgetown area. Dr. Scott served in the Barbados Senate from 1964 to 1967, and in 1966 was appointed to the Privy Council of Barbados. In May 1967, on the retirement of Sir John Stow (the last colonial Governor of Barbados), Dr. Scott was appointed Governor-General by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. In the same year he was knighted and became known as Sir Winston Scott. Sir Winston Scott was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He died suddenly while in office.

Four of the group earlier wrote the novel Q (first edition 1999). Unlike the open name \\"Luther Blissett\\", \\"Wu Ming\\" stands for a defined group of writers active in literature and popular culture. The band authored several novels, some of which have been translated in many countries. Their books are seen as part of a body of literary works (the \\"nebula\\", as it is frequently called in Italy) described as the New Italian Epic, a phrase that was proposed by Wu Ming.\\"We're Going To Have To Be The Parents\\": A Reflection on the New Italian Epic\\", opening talk at the conference The Italian Perspective on Metahistorical Fiction: The New Italian Epic, IGRS, University of London, 2 October 2008.

Meaning of the name In Chinese, \\"wu ming\\" can mean \\"anonymous\\" () or, with a different tone on the first syllable, \\"five people\\" (), the pun being part of the reason the collective adopted the name.\\"Wu Ming: Who we are and what we do\\", biographical page on Wu Ming's website, even though the Chinese for \\"people\\" is actually \\"min Ê∞ë\\". The name is meant both as a tribute to dissidents (\\"Wu Ming\\" is a common byline among Chinese citizens demanding democracy and freedom of speech) and as a rejection of the celebrity-making machine which turns the author into a star. \\"Wu Ming\\" is also a reference to the third sentence in the Daodejing: \\"Heaven and Earth's nameless origin\\" (). Members and public personae The picture that Wu Ming used as an \\"official portrait\\" from 2001 to 2008, when the quintet became a quartet. As of 14 January 2009, the image is completely absent from the group's official website. The members of Wu Ming are typically known as \\"Wu Ming 1\\", \\"Wu Ming 2\\", \\"Wu Ming 3\\", \\"Wu Ming 4\\", and \\"Wu Ming 5\\". Real names are not secret though: *Roberto Bui (Wu Ming 1) *Giovanni Cattabriga (Wu Ming 2) *Luca Di Meo (Wu Ming 3 ‚Äì He left the group in the spring of 2008On 16 September 2008, Wu Ming's newsletter Giap announced that Luca Di Meo had left the band for personal reasons, and the separation had taken place in the previous springtime.

Probably a jocular reference to Californian rock band Grateful Dead's extensive touring and their close relationship with fans.) and frequently appear in public. However, they refuse to be photographed or filmed by the media. Even on their official website, they do not provide any pictures of themselves. Here is how Wu Ming 1 explained the group's stance in a 2007 interview: In Wu Ming's official biographical page (Italian version), the collective denies rumors they once beat up a press photographer: 54 54 is a complex novel about popular culture, the shattered dreams of the Italian Resistance, and the relationship between Europe and America.Detailed review from the Soundtracks for Them e-zine Background research began in 1999, after the publication of the group's previous novel Q. Plots were outlined in the aftermath of the Kosovo war. Actual writing work ended ten days after 11 September, on the eve of the war in Afghanistan. These two wars are explicitly referred to in the novel's End Titles: \\"Begun in May 1999, during the Nato bombings of Belgrade. Delivered to the Italian publishers on September 21, 2001, awaiting the escalation\\". The events leading to (and following) 11 September are also allegorically described in the book's forenote. 54 was published in Italy in the springtime of 2002. In the following months, Wu Ming collaborated with Italian folk-rock band Yo Yo Mundi, whose ensuing concept album 54 (2004) was directly inspired from the novel. Radio Alice / Working Slowly Wu Ming is also credited as co-writers for the screenplay of the Italian film Lavorare con lentezza (aka Radio Alice), directed by Guido Chiesa, released in Italy in 2004. The original title means \\"Working slowly\\" and cites a protest song, a popular leftist anthem in the 1970s: \\"Work slowly / And effortlessly / Work may hurt you / And send you to the hospital / Where there's no bed left / And you may even die. / Work slowly / And effortlessly / Health is priceless.\\" (Translated by Wu Ming)\\"Working Slowly in the UK\\", March 2005 The film is set during a student uprising that paralysed Bologna for several days in March 1977. Several narrative threads are woven around Radio Alice, the station run by the \\"creative wing\\" (the so-called \\"Mao-Dadaists\\") of the radical Autonomia movement. In the morning of 11 March a brawl involving radical and catholic students escalated to a full-scale riot in the university district. The Carabinieri riot squad attacked and shot down a 25-year-old student called Francesco Lorusso. As a result, thousands of students and activists stormed the centre of the town, clashing with the police and throwing molotov cocktails. On 13 March the premises of Radio Alice were invaded and vandalised by the police, the station was shut down and every member of the staff was arrested. The film tells the story mixing real anecdotes with semi-fictional characters. Radio Alice has won several awards and prizes at movie festivals all over Europe, including the Marcello Mastroianni Award for the Best Young Actors at the 2004 Venice Film Festival and the First Prize at the 2005 Festival de Cinema Politic in Barcelona, Spain. Manituana Manituana is the third of Wu Ming's collectively authored novels. It was written in the 2003‚Äì07 period and published in Italy in 2007. It is the first episode of an 18th-century pan-Atlantic trilogy which the authors call \\"the Atlantic Triptych\\". All novels will be set in the 1770s, all across the Atlantic Ocean (North America, Europe, the West Indies and Africa), before and during the American Revolution. In the springtime of 2007, Manituana reached No. 4 in the Italian best-seller chartsReported on Italian daily paper La Stampa on 7 April 2007, article included by Wu Ming on their website. The English translation was published in the UK and the US by Verso Books in the Fall of 2009. In an entry on their weblog, Wu Ming wrote that The novel is set in the years 1775‚Äì1783 in New York's Mohawk Valley, Quebec and London (UK). Among the many real historical chapters that populate the book, the most important ones are Joseph Brant, war chief of the Mohawk nation, and Molly Brant, a matron of the Wolf clan in the Iroquois Six Nations. In Italy Manituana was awarded the Premio Sergio Leone 2007 and the Premio Emilio Salgari 2008. In November 2010 it was nominated for International Dublin Literary Award. Altai In May 2009 Wu Ming announced that they had almost finished writing a new book, entitled Altai, set \\"in [their debut novel] Q's world and historical continuum\\". \\"After this accomplishment\\", they added, \\"we'll go back to the Atlantic Triptych.\\"\\"Never Say Never Again. Autumn 2009, Back to Q\\" , Wu Ming Foundation Blog, 12 May 2009. Later on, they explained: The novel, entitled Altai, was published in Italy on 20 November 2009 and immediately reached No. 5 in the national list of best-sellers.\\"Altai's first week: straight to the 5th place\\", wumingfoundation.com, 28 November 2009. The solo novels Starting from 2001, each individual member of Wu Ming also authored one or more \\"solo\\" novels. Some of them have been translated into other languages, but not yet in English. Wu Ming 1 is the author of New Thing (2004), an \\"unidentified narrative object\\" blending fiction, journalism and free verse. It is an allegorical tale on free jazz and the 1960s, set in 1967 New York City and constructed around John Coltrane's final days. The French newspaper Le Monde described the book as \\"a choral novel, an inquiry, and a political jam-session loaded with syncopated poetry\\".\\"A l'extr√™me gauche de l'Occident...\\", Le Monde des livres, 24 August 2007. Wu Ming 2 is the author of Guerra agli umani [War on the Humans] (2004), a satire of primitivism and survivalism set on the Apennines in an undefined year. The main character and narrator is called Marco, but he nicknames himself \\"Marco Walden\\", after Thoreau's Walden. At the beginning of the book, Marco quits his job as a restroom cleaner at a big cemetery, because he wants to leave the city (presumably Bologna, although it remains unnamed), go to the mountains and become a \\"hunter-gatherer superhero\\". Wu Ming 4 is the author of Stella del mattino [Star of the Morning] (2008). The novel is set in 1919 Oxford and centered around T.E. Lawrence suffering writer's block while working on The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Among the characters Lawrence encounters in the book, important roles are played by writers J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and, most notably, Robert Graves. Wu Ming themselves described Stella del mattino as \\"the best solo novel ever manufactured in our smithy\\" and \\"a bridge between our collective and solo novels\\".\\"Stella del mattino\\", from Giap #22/23, May 2008. Wu Ming 5 is the author of both Havana Glam (2001) and Free Karma Food (2007). Havana Glam is set in an alternate 1970s world where David Bowie is a communist sympathizer and has a \\"Cuban period\\" instead of a \\"Berlin period\\". This causes some turmoil in Havana, as the Cuban intelligence suspect the rockstar to be an infiltrator. Free Karma Food describes a future society where all kinds of cattle have been killed by a global pandemic known as \\"The Great Murrain\\". Some Italian critics described Wu Ming 5's novels as belonging to the literary subgenre known as \\"New Weird\\". Such inclusion, however, has been questioned in weblogs and social network discussion groups devoted to science-fiction.See A. Barone, \\"New Weird, New Italian Epic, Steampunk e il pregiudizio italiano sulla letteratura fantastica\\", May 2009. Other activities Wu Ming 1 is the Italian translator of several Elmore Leonard novels. He translated Cat Chaser, Freaky Deaky, Tishomingo Blues and Mr Paradise, and wrote an essay on how to render Leonard's prose into ItalianWu Ming 1, \\"La sfida di Elmore Leonard ai traduttori italiani\\". The essay was published in the catalogue of the 2006 Courmayer Noir in Festival, at which Leonard was presented with the Raymond Chandler Award.\\"Elmore to be presented Raymond Chandler Award\\", elmoreleonard.com, 29 July 2006. Wu Ming 1 also translated one Walter Mosley novel, Little Scarlet. In 2010 he became the Italian translator of Stephen King's books.\\"Wu Ming, Stephen King: It isn't just a rhyme\\", Wu Ming Foundation Blog, 26 May 2010. Wu Ming 2 has written the theater play Razza Partigiana in 2013; he is also participating on stage, with musical support from Paul Pieretto, Federico Oppi (Settlefish) and Egle Sommacal (Massimo Volume). The plot follows the story of Giorgio Marincola, a partisan from World War II, a dark-skinned Italian who is the son of a Somalian mother and an Italian father, born in 1923 near Mogadishu. Wu Ming 5 was guitar player in :it:Nabat, one of the first Oi! bands to reach a cult following in Italy during the early 1980s. The band broke up in 1987 but got together again in the early 1990s, only to break up again in 1998. Nabat reunited in 2010 for a comeback tour, with Wu Ming 5 still on guitar, \\"splitting services between two bands [Wu Ming and Nabat]\\", as he quipped during a radio interview.Wu Ming 1 and Wu Ming 5 interviewed on Radio Ciroma, 8 April 2010.

While there is no consensus as to the meaning of the inscription, there is general agreement that Buta-ul and Buyla are personal names from a Turkic language, and that both are identified as holding the title of ≈æupan. Other very short inscriptions found on the artifacts there are in a runiform script and also likely to be in a Turkic language, but these are very brief and have not been deciphered.Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas, Hungarians and Europe in the early Middle Ages (Central European University Press, 1999; ), pp. 131‚Äì132 Interpretations Various sources provided different interpretations of the inscription.

According to Serbian historian Milan Tutorov, grand ≈æupan Buta-ul was ruler of two Getae lands, Targorska and Eciska and across the Tisa. Tutorov claims that \\"Getae land\\" was designation for present-day Banat, while area \\"across the Tisa\\" is present-day Baƒçka. According to Tutorov, Buta-ul was an Avar noble who had a traditional Slavic ruler's title ‚Äì the \\"great ≈æupan\\" (rendering veliki ≈æupan). Tutorov also speculates that the Treasure of Gro√ü Sankt Nikolaus was probably buried by Buta-ul in 796, when Pippin, the son of Frankish ruler Charlemagne, penetrated with his army into the centre of Avar caganate near the river Tisa. It is assumed that Buta-ul buried his treasure in great hurry before the Frankish army arrived, since the treasure was buried only half metre deep in the ground.

During his time with BBC Radio in London, Brackley covered football - including two FA Cup Finals and the 1982 European Cup Final - and athletics, as well as presenting flagship programmes Sport on Two and Sports Report. =ITV= The summer of 1982 saw Brackley make the switch to television, initially with ITV company Central Independent Television replacing Hugh Johns. During his initial spell with the network he covered the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the European Championship in France in 1984 - including commentaries on semi-final matches in both tournaments. His first live match for ITV Sport was the First Division contest between Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday in April 1986. He also stepped into the breach during the live broadcast of the 1986 European Cup Final between Barcelona and Steaua Bucharest alongside that night's ITV studio co-pundit, Ron Atkinson, when communication with the commentary team in Seville, Brian Moore and Kevin Keegan, was lost. =Sky= In 1988 Brackley left ITV. Still stuck behind Brian Moore, Martin Tyler and Alan Parry in the pecking order he made the move to Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television. The bulk of his work would be for the pan- European channel Eurosport, then part-owned by Sky. He led their commentary team at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, with Ian Darke, Paul Dempsey and Gary Bloom among his colleagues. Brackley was also behind the mic for Sky's first live matches, which came in the Zenith Data Systems Cup. When Sky and BSB merged in 1991, Brackley took up other duties including regular FA Cup matches and weekly coverage of live Italian football. This was the continuation of a long relationship with coverage of Serie A, which had actually begun in the middle of the 1980s when he took up work for CSI Sports who picked up the international broadcast rights. Brackley also commentated Eurosport's coverage of the 1991 World Masters snooker tournament at the NEC in Birmingham alongside Mike Watterson, Jim Wych, Willie Jamieson, Paul Wade and Phil Yates. =Football Italia= This association with Italian football deepened in 1992 when, in the wake of Paul Gascoigne's transfer from Tottenham to Serie A side Lazio, Channel 4 moved in to buy up the rights to cover the league. For the next decade they provided regular live action on Sunday afternoons, with Brackley commentating from a studio in England.\\"TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO\\", The Guardian, 25 January 2000, retrieved 23 January 2010Hannigan, Mary (1999) \\"Quotes of the week\\", Irish Times, 13 December 1999, retrieved 2010-01-23, \\"You'd be surprised how many people think I do it from Italy\\" He worked alongside the likes of James Richardson, Kenneth Wolstenholme, Gary Bloom, Ray Wilkins, Don Howe and Luther Blissett,Winter, Henry (1992) \\"Football: Sampdoria set ball rolling: Henry Winter on Channel 4's winning start with a big draw in the Italian League\\", The Independent, 7 September 1992, retrieved 23 January 2010 =Return to ITV= 1992 was an eventful year for Brackley, as he also returned to the fold at ITV Sport. Fresh from the shock of losing rights to the new Premier League to British Sky Broadcasting, the various ITV regions began to place more emphasis on live coverage of the lower leagues. On 16 August 1992, Brackley was partnered by Ron Atkinson for Central's first live broadcast of a Football League match since the split when Birmingham City faced Notts County at St Andrew's. From the second week on, Alan Parry became the regular voice on The Central Match Live until 1996 when ITV lost the rights to live league football. This return to ITV saw Brackley feature prominently in coverage of another four World Cups, from 1994 to 2006 and the European Championships in 1996 and 2000. He was also a regular commentator on the network's Champions League programmes and contributed frequently to highlights programmes on Central and Meridian Broadcasting in the south of England. He also commentated on his only major final for ITV in 2000 - the League Cup final between Leicester City and Tranmere Rovers. From August 2001, he featured heavily in ITV's coverage of Premiership highlights on The Premiership. He commentated on the very first match of the very first programme in August 2001, Middlesbrough v Arsenal. In addition to his commentaries for the programme, he utilised his skills as an impressionist during the 'Brack Chat' segment of the Monday night highlights programme. After the demise of the ITV Sport Channel in 2002, Brackley's network commitments were considerably reduced (though he continued to work on Premiership highlights until 2004), featuring only very occasionally before returning as part of the team for the World Cup in Germany in 2006. His main source of work was coverage of the England national football team and the FA Cup for international distributor Octagon CSI. He covered the majority of FA Cup Finals between 1992 and 2008 for them. The 2008-09 season saw Brackley do the FA Cup highlights show for ITV. His games were Leicester‚ÄìStevenage, Fleetwood‚ÄìHartlepool, Hull‚ÄìNewcastle, Doncaster‚ÄìAston Villa, and Blackburn‚ÄìCoventry.  Other activities  As well as a successful broadcasting career, Brackley also carved a niche as a comedian and impressionist. He undertook several UK tours with Southampton fan and comedian Mike Osman, including a run as part of George Best and Rodney Marsh's stage show. He also performed with Osman, Richard Digance and others on several programmes for BBC Radio. In 1990, Brackley stood in for an indisposed Jimmy Greaves on the long-running ITV Sport show Saint and Greavsie. The commentator provided the voice for Greaves' Spitting Image caricature. He also undertook voiceover work for Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., the club he supported, and wrote a weekly column in the city's Argus newspaper.

American soldiers from the 31st Infantry marching near Vladivostok Russia April 27, 1919 The American Expeditionary Force, Siberia (AEF in Siberia) was a formation of the United States Army involved in the Russian Civil War in Vladivostok, Russia, after the October Revolution, from 1918 to 1920. The force was part of the larger Allied North Russia Intervention. As a result of this expedition, early relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were poor. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's claimed objectives for sending troops to Siberia were as much diplomatic as they were military. One major reason was to rescue the 40,000 men of the Czechoslovak Legion, who were being held up by Bolshevik forces as they attempted to make their way along the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladivostok, and it was hoped, eventually to the Western Front. Another major reason was to protect the large quantities of military supplies and railroad rolling stock that the United States had sent to the Russian Far East in support of the Russian Empire's war efforts on the Eastern Front of World War I. Equally stressed by Wilson was the need to \\"steady any efforts at self-government or self defense in which the Russians themselves may be willing to accept assistance.\\" At the time, Bolshevik forces in Siberia controlled only small pockets, and President Wilson wanted to make sure that neither Cossack marauders nor the Japanese military would take advantage of the unstable political environment along the strategic railroad line and in the resource- rich Siberian regions that straddled it. Anticommunism was also a strong factor. Concurrently and for similar reasons, about 5,000 American soldiers were sent to Arkhangelsk (Archangel), Russia by Wilson as part of the separate Polar Bear Expedition. History The AEF in Siberia was commanded by Major General William S. Graves and eventually totaled 7,950 officers and enlisted men. The force included the U.S. Army's 27th and 31st Infantry Regiments, plus large numbers of volunteers from the 12th, 13th, and 62nd Infantry Regiments of the 8th Division, Graves' former division command. The U.S. troops were equipped with M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles (BAR) and Auto-5 shotguns/trench clearers, M1903 Springfield rifles, and M1911 .45 caliber pistols, depending on their duties. Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles were also used. Although General Graves did not arrive in Siberia until September 4, 1918, the first 3,000 American troops disembarked in Vladivostok between August 15 and August 21, 1918. They were quickly assigned guard duty along segments of the railway between Vladivostok and Nikolsk-Ussuriski in the north. Unlike his Allied counterparts, General Graves believed their mission in Siberia was to provide protection for American-supplied property and to help the Czechoslovak Legion evacuate Russia, and that it did not include fighting against the Bolsheviks. Repeatedly calling for restraint, Graves often clashed with commanders of British, French, and Japanese forces, who also had troops in the region and who wanted him to take a more active part in the military intervention in Siberia. AEF Hospital Car Number 1 at Khabarovsk, Russia To operate the Trans- Siberian Railroad, the Russian Railway Service Corps was formed of US personnel. Congressional Hearings The experience in Siberia for the soldiers was miserable. Problems with fuel, ammunition, supplies, and food were widespread. Horses accustomed to temperate climates were unable to function in sub-zero Russia. Water-cooled machine guns froze and became useless. The last American soldiers left Siberia on April 1, 1920. During their 19 months in Siberia, 189 soldiers of the force died from all causes. As a comparison, the smaller American North Russia Expeditionary Force experienced 235 deaths from all causes during their nine months of fighting near Arkhangelsk. American socialist author Upton Sinclair, in his novel Oil!, references the AEF in Siberia and ascribes capitalist motives as the primary driver of the Allied intervention.

Named for the Sanssouci Palace, the press produced pamphlets decrying the supposed liberalism of Wilhelm II's reign, and particularly his ties to the English. The Press is not to be confused with the later Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts firm of the same name.  Authors  Its inventory was relatively obscure, limited as it was to those who knew of the press's existence and who met its rather stringent ideological qualifications for publishing. It published works by such little-known authors as soldier and politician Karl Groener, historian and sociologist Otto C. Hiss, and general Karl von B√ºlow. Von B√ºlow's anonymous pamphlet criticizing the Schlieffen Plan to invade France caused a minor stir when it garnered the attention of Kaiser Wilhelm II's inner circle. There is little evidence that it was much noticed or influential elsewhere. Several small booklets of the poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt, dating from the early 1890s, have surfaced in recent years. Contemporary sources link the press to bawdy songs about Albert I, King of the Belgians; none of these has come to light. For many years it relied on reprints of 18th-century polemical pamphlets produced during the reign of Frederick the Great, whose relationship to contemporary political questions was not always immediately clear. This continued through World War One.  Decline  By the time of World War I, the press had devolved into a vanity press that continued to operate, off and on, until Otto Dietrich, Hitler's Reich Chief of the Press, shut it down in 1937. Despite the political conservatism of the press, its backers--by then in their second generation-- were to the end loyal if occasionally critical supporters of the Hohenzollern monarchy and could not abide the rise of the low-born Adolf Hitler. The press's location was discovered when correspondence between Hiss and the deposed Kaiser Wilhelm was intercepted by German officials, monitoring all mail destined for the Kaiser's place of exile in Doorn, the Netherlands. Hiss, for his part, escaped to the Netherlands and ultimately England; the identities of others directly involved in the press remain a mystery.

It was called The Confessions of a Frivolous Girl, a realistic depiction of the problems facing young women. He published his second novel An Average Man in 1883, a study of two young New York lawyers with very different ambitions. His next novel was Face to Face (1886), which demonstrated the difference between English and American manners and social standards. Also in 1886, Ticknor and Fields published his 198-page novel, The Knave of Hearts, billed as a \\"fairy\\" story but more of a Victorian romance. He followed that with the novel that proved to be his most successful. Unleavened Bread (1900), the story of a woman who abandons her moral standards in a search for prestige and dominance was one of the best selling novels of 1900. His output continued with The Undercurrent (1904); The Orchid (1905), an examination of the impact of divorce in the upper class; The Chippendales (1909), the story of the decline in character of a Boston family over the course of several generations; The High Priestess (1915), detailing a woman's struggle to have a career; and The Bishop's Granddaughter (1925), a humorous view and critique of American divorce law.James D.

A biographer notes that he was not a good choice as he was not a legal scholar and was handicapped by age. The Committee concluded that the trial had been fair, but its report included some measured criticism of the judge in the case, Webster Thayer. Judge Grant furnished the language that found \\"a grave breach of judicial decorum\\". Later Grant allowed that he was \\"amazed and incensed\\" at the biased comments Judge Thayer made outside the courtroom. In later years he was known to struggle with the judgment the Committee had rendered, though in his autobiography he took a \\"defensive, almost bellicose tone.\\" He maintained a particularly acute animus toward Harvard Professor of Law Felix Frankfurter who published an article making the case for the defense in the Atlantic Monthly while appeals were still pending.

Initially active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they reformed in 2008. Biography =Main career (1987‚Äì1993)= Lawnmower Deth were formed in Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire, England in 1987 by friends Chris Flint, Joseph Whitaker, Pete Lee, Steve Nesfield and Chris Parkes, along with Gavin ‚ÄòPaddy‚Äô O‚ÄôMalley from Colwick. Their first official release was a split album with Metal Duck. Lawnmower Deth's side of the record was entitled Mower Liberation Front and positive responses led to their debut studio album, Ooh Crikey, It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Lawnmower Deth. Their second studio album, Return of the Fabulous Metal Bozo Clowns, was released in 1992. For this release, Paddy was replaced by Kev Papworth. The band covered several famous songs in their time, including Fleetwood Mac's \\"The Chain\\", Mot√∂rhead's self- titled song, Squeeze's \\"Up the Junction\\", The Osmonds' \\"Crazy Horses\\", and Kim Wilde's \\"Kids in America\\" which was released as the band's only single in 1991. The band's sense of humour extended into their music videos. Both \\"Kids in America\\" and \\"Lawnmowers for Heroes, Comics for Zeros\\", the latter from Metal Bozo Clowns, were recorded on home video cameras and edited in an amateur fashion. The band's third and final studio album, Billy, was released in 1994. The album had a pop punk style similar Green Day instead of thrash metal. Poor sales and a declining audience led the band to break up later on that year. =Reunion (2008‚Äìpresent)= Lawnmower Deth announced that they would be reuniting to support Welsh metalcore band Bullet for My Valentine for a one off gig on 15 November 2008 at the Alexandra Palace in London. The band played at the 2009 Download Festival at Donington Park, their first appearance, and returned to play the festival the following year. Lawnmower Deth then went on to play a main stage slot at Damnation Festival 2010 in Leeds and announced a further date at Redemption in Derby on 28 May 2011. On 12 August, Lawnmower Deth played Bloodstock Open Air festival at Catton Hall in Derbyshire. They appeared at the festival again on 9 August 2015. Lawnmower Deth played at Hammerfest 4, in Prestatyn, Wales on 16 March 2012, during which requests were made to Earache to re-release their full back catalogue. Their first half-album, Mower Liberation Front was re-released on vinyl and CD in April 2012. It came with the associated Metal Duck half-album Quack Em All and a selection of bonus tracks including the 1988 demo Mowdeer. Early purchasers received a DVD of a concert at Nottingham Rock City from 26 November 1990. On 20 December 2013, the band played a headline set at the Rescue Rooms in Nottingham. Also on the bill were Line of Fire (featuring Deth member Paddy on guitars), reformed thrash outfit Re-Animator playing their first gig in 25 years, and the also recently reformed Xentrix. The concert and associated raffles, etc. raised money for the hate awareness charity S.O.P.H.I.E. and in excess of ¬£8,000 was collected.

The band has released nine albums and two EPs to date. History Formed in Aarhus, Denmark, by guitarist Peter \\"Pepe\\" Hansen in 2000, HateSphere quickly overpowered the Danish metal scene, while concurrently setting an immeasurable new standard for thrash metal domestically and abroad. HateSphere's first three albums, Hatesphere, Bloodred Hatred and Ballet of the Brute, upgraded the band's status from local sensation to Europe's hottest up and coming thrash quintet. Under the leadership of Scarlet Records, HateSphere toured Europe with The Haunted in 2003 and again with Exodus in 2004, while also turning heads at Wacken Open Air, With Full Force, and Hellfest Festivals. In 2005, HateSphere inked a deal with SPV Records and assembled a production team of established Danish producers; including Tommy Hansen, Jacob Hansen, and Tue Madsen. The Sickness Within was released in September of that same year receiving rave reviews from the worldwide metal media. The pure ferocity, complexity, and brutal grooves enshrined in the album, landed HateSphere on multiple tours of Europe with Kreator, Morbid Angel, Soilwork, Dark Tranquillity, and Chimaira. In addition to headlining shows in support of The Sickness Within, the band made appearances at Wacken Open Air, Metal Camp, and Roskilde Festival. HateSphere continued to raise its profile on an international level by touring Japan, co- headlining the UK with Gojira, and headlining the first edition of The Danish Dynamite tour with Raunchy and Volbeat. HateSphere again made history by being the first Danish band to tour China. Following the 2007 release of Serpent Smiles and Killer Eyes, HateSphere yet again hit the road headlining Europe with Aborted and Dagoba, which was followed by successful performances at Wacken Open Air and Roskilde Festivals and a support tour of Poland with Behemoth in September. Serpent Smiles and Killer Eyes also shot up to position 26 on the Danish National Music Charts. Soon thereafter, HateSphere amicably parted ways with then vocalist Jacob Bredahl, who chose to concentrate on other musical endeavors. Without missing a beat, HateSphere assembled its strongest, and present lineup, showcasing its intensity, bottomless drive, and ravenous new frontman Joller Albrechtsen at the 2007 Danish Metal Awards (DMeA). All doubt cast over the band's lineup instantly shattered as the band hit the ground running with a monthlong co-headlining tour of Europe with Swedish legends Dismember. HateSphere was indeed back in business. HateSphere entered Antfarm Studios in November 2008 to record the next album entitled To the Nines. To the Nines was recorded, mixed and mastered in less than a month under the leadership of longtime friend and producer Tue Madsen (Earth Crisis, The Haunted, Heaven Shall Burn) at AntFarm Studios in Aarhus and was released by Napalm Records.

Ali Imran enjoys living around a complete family: a father, mother, and a sister. Several of Imran's female cousins, often found making fun of him, lives with his family. Imran's dearly attachment with his family is evident in some of the books. For example, In the \\"Allama Dehshatnak\\" serial, he finds the only way to anger the villain is by getting personal with him and mocking his history and the fact that his family was very brutally destroyed. By doing so however, Imran provokes the villain to counter by bombing his family's house. At this point the reader sees how deeply Imran loves his family as he rushes to the scene throwing all the caution out of the window. Imran's parents, it is also often told, are yousuf zai pathan and direct descendant of Genghis Khan. Ali Imran's Family =Karam Rahman= (Fazal Rehman \\"F Rahman\\") Rehman Sahib is Imran's father and the director general of Intelligence Bureau. Imran's grandfather (From father side) \\"Dada\\" named his son Rehman Sahib as \\"Fazal Rahman\\". Imran's grandfather (From mother side) \\"Nana\\" named his son Rehman Sahib as \\"Karim Rehman\\". Some translated line from Ibn-e-Safi Imran Series book 93 Sah Rangi Mout: \\"And yes! Perhaps I wrote the name of Rahman Sahib's grandfather, Karam Rehman, in the bookletters of the previous book. Many of my readers have mentioned that their name is Fazal Rahman (F Rahman). Well, What can I do with their grandparents and grandmothers?.... This affair went on with their grandparents and grandparents. Nana used to call \\"karmu\\" and grandpa used to say \\"waste\\" .... I remember the name of Nanali when writing pashers .... Well .... if you too are his grandfather's If you are biased, what will I do? Same with \\"F Rahman\\". Some translated lines from Ibn-e-Safi Imran Series book 92 Kaali Kehkishan, Paishras: \\"Twenty years later, a person has pointed to one of my \\"sins\\". The request is that this respect is limited to mere nouns. People have not been so careful in regard to virtues. You will often hear this kind of noise on the streets, \\"Abbey o Ghaffarey\\" or \\"oh Rahimey going where.\\" ? \\" To my dismay, the only reason for this failure is that Allah has declared His attributes to be a worthy servant. God bless. If I am wrong, God will forgive me. Many Islamic scholars also read my books. Would be grateful if they could guide me in this regard. By the way, Imran's father's full name is not Abdul Rahman but Karam Rehman. I call myself K.Rahman and I have written \\"Rehman sir\\" from the beginning till now! Not just Rehman, he also wrote that the arrogant side had come out.\\" Rahman Sahib has a stern personality and a strict dictator. He is somewhat responsible for Imran's paradoxical personality. Initially wanting Imran to become a professor at a local university, he was very upset when Imran was appointed as a special officer in his own department. Later, he cancelled Imran's license by dismissing his roguery strategies that he employed for catching a smuggler in \\"Bhayanak Aadmi\\" (The Frightening Man - #4). Highly annoyed by Imran and his actions, he then ordered him to leave the house. Mr. Rahman is the Director General of the Central Intelligence Bureau, and a very strict person both at home and in the office. Although Imran solves a very mysterious case in \\"Bhayanak Aadmi\\", he does not like the way Imran handles the situation; so he fires Imran and also asks him to leave the family house. Underneath his tough exterior, he loves Imran and is internally pleased with his successes. However, his stubbornness does not allow him to reveal his sentiments. =Amma Bi= Imran's mother, Amma Bi, is an eastern style housewife. She is a victim of the strict nature of her husband, Abdul Rehman. When Imran is forced to leave the house, she is against the decision but is helpless to do anything because of her husband. In some novels, it is shown that when Imran visits her, she gets emotional and starts crying, beating him with her slippers. =Surayya= Imran's younger sister Surayya is blessed with the strict nature of her father. She is also fed up with Imran's unserious behavior and lets no opportunity slide to show her anger towards her brother. Imran's love for his sister is shown in the novel \\"Aadha Teeter\\" in which Imran struggles to protect her Fianc√©e from a blackmailer.

Examples of occupations with a patter might include the auctioneer, salesperson, dance caller, magician, or comedian. The term may have been a colloquial shortening of \\"Pater Noster\\", or the Lord's Prayer, and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling prayers quickly and mechanically. From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a cant language used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a cheap-jack employs to pass off his goods. Many illusionists, e.g., card magicians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators. It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a patter-song, in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance caller may interpolate patter‚Äîin the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense‚Äîto fill in between commands to the dancers.Square Dance Patter Sayings Vic & Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net. In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of \\"patter\\": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here, it is a form of onomatopoeia. In certain forms of entertainment, peep shows (in the historical meaning) and Russian rayok, patter is an important component of a show. The radio DJ patter is among the roots of rapping. In hypnotherapy, the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

The right for educational activity in the School is authorised by license ‚Ññ24–ì-0299 issued by the Russian Federation Ministry of general and professional education on 1 April 1999 and certificate ‚Ññ25-0790 of state approval granted by the Russian Federation Ministry of Education on 7 December 1999. The School owns Certificate 005 of Federal Aviation Authority of Russia dated by 20 February 2002.  History  The Ulyanovsk Civil Aviation Institute is the oldest flight school for civil pilots training in Russia. The flight school started its activities in 1935 in Bataysk. In 1939 due to the unsafe international situation, the school moved to Mineralnye Vody, meanwhile Bataysk United school was given to RKKA. In October 1941 due to World War II, the school was relocated to Tashkent, and its main task became to provide the Red Army with Il-2 pilots. In May 1944 the school came back to Mineralnye Vody, where they continued to train specialists on Il-2 aircraft, and in 1947 they started to train civilian pilots on a new aeroplane, the Il-12. Also in 1947 the school was renamed from \\"Higher flight courses\\"(–ö–í–õ–ü/KVLP) to \\"Higher flight school\\"(–®–í–õ–ü/ShVLP), which was relocated to Buguruslan in Orenburg Oblast, and later to Ulyanovsk in 1950. In 1955 Il-14 pilot training started, and in 1958 pilot training on An-10 and Il-18, aeroplanes with turboshaft engines began. In the beginning of the 60s, the school started to train Tu-104 pilots. In November 1955 the training of foreign pilots started, when specialists from East Germany arrived. But a really mass training of air crew started in 1957. Pilots, flight-engineers, flight-radio operators from GDR, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary were trained on the Il-14. When aeroplanes with turboprop engines Il-18 and An-10 arrived, training of pilots from Guinea, Mali and Ghana started as well. From 1962 to 1972 in Ulyanovsk Higher Flight School were mastered a lot of aeroplanes such as the Tu-124, Tu-134, Tu-154 and An-24. In December 1974 it was decided to create \\"Comecon Civil Aviation Centre\\"(–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –ì–ê –°–≠–í). Firstly it was decided to build Training Laboratories, an Aviation Training Centre and a Hotel. On the next turn it was planned to build a Medical Centre, Gym, Swimming Pool, etc. In the beginning of 1983 the building of the Centre's main objectives was completed. 307x307pxIn this period Il-62, Il-76, Il-86 and Yak-42 pilot training started. From 1980 to 1985 more than 15 thousand aviation specialists from 40 countries were trained. In 1985 when the Civil Aviation Centre of Comecon was celebrating its 50th Anniversary, it was awarded with the Order of Friendship of Peoples. In 1983 The Museum of Civil Aviation of the USSR was organised in Comecon Civil Aviation Centre. Besides 4 galleries with approximately 7000 exhibits and documents, 28 aeroplanes and helicopters are standing in the open air, including the first passenger aircraft Tu-104 and the first supersonic passenger aircraft Tu-144. Due to the USSR's demise, Higher Civil Aviation schools based in Aktobe and Kirovograd were left outside Russia. As the result there was a problem of air crew training with higher professional education for the airlines of Russia. To solve that problem, in October 1992 it was decided to reform \\"Comecon Civil Aviation Centre\\" into the \\"Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School\\". In 1994 an ATC training started. In 1995 an extramural studying form started. In 1998 the first \\"pilots-engineers\\" and \\"air traffic controllers-engineers\\" graduated from UHCAS. In 2000 a Search-and-Rescue specialists' and managers' training course started. In February 2013 there were 1030 cadet-pilots studying. 137 pilots graduated in 2013, and in 2014 the figure was 188 pilots. In December 2015 \\"Ulyanovsk Higher Civil Aviation School\\" was renamed the \\"Ulyanovsk Civil Aviation Institute\\".  Available specialities  The Institute provides specialist training in accordance with higher professional education curricula based on the requirements of State educational standards of the Russian Federation.

This first bridge seems to have been made of wood, because the court record from 1565 witness that the stone bridge was built here by eminent citizen of Sarajevo Ali Ajni-Beg. A terrible flood on 15 November 1791 badly damaged the bridge and its reconstruction was financed by the Sarajevo merchant Abdulah-aga Briga. Someone worked out that the year when it was rebuilt can be obtained from the numerical values in the word 'Briga' ‚Äì it is 1213, which by Islamic calendar equals the year of the reconstruction 1798/99. The bridge has four arches and rests on three strong pillars and the embankment; it is built of stone and gypsum and the two relieving openings, 'eyes' in the mass above pillars are so characteristic that they can be seen in the seal of Sarajevo. Because of heavy traffic at the time of Austria- Hungary, the pavements on consoles were added to the bridge. During the Yugoslav era, the bridge was known as Principov most / –ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–ø–æ–≤ –º–æ—Å—Ç ‚Äì \\"Princip's Bridge\\".

This was the immediate cause for the beginning of the First World War. The bridge was renamed Princip during the Yugoslavian era. The name returned to the Latin Bridge after the Yugoslav Wars. =Princip's testimony= At the judicial hearing on October 12, 1914, Gavrilo Princip described the site of the shooting during his interrogation, specifically mentioning the bridge.

It was designed by Vincent Raven and introduced in 1920. The earlier members of this class were fitted with Westinghouse Brakes - all of this equipment was removed during the 1930s. Post-NER Seventy S3/B16 locomotives were built between 1919 and 1924. The NER began numbering this class in the range No. 840 through to No. 943 (though not contiguously), those built after late 1922 (from No. 2363 onwards) directly receiving their LNER number. In 1923 all seventy locomotives passed to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Some of the existing members were subsequently rebuilt, as shown below (the initially built locomotives being re-designated class B16/1. Seven were rebuilt by Gresley, becoming class B16/2 and seventeen, by Thompson, designated class B16/3). Under the LNER re-numbering scheme, of 1946, they received numbers 1400-1468. Sixty-nine passed into British Railways ownership in 1948 and they were again re-numbered in the sequence 61400-61478. (Numbers 61400 to 61409 were directly re-numbered as 61469 to 61478).

Davis claimed she had used her real-life experiences to inspire fiction, but that Bindrim was not the psychologist in her fictional story, and did not resemble him‚Äîthe character she depicted was overweight, looked like Santa Claus, and had a Ph.D. When the case came to trial, Bindrim, who had previously been bald and clean shaven, and who held only a master's degree, had by then gained weight, grown a white beard, and been granted a Ph.D. from International College in Westwood, California.

In 1995, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Born in Oklahoma, Franklin attended Fisk University and then Harvard University, receiving his doctorate in 1941. He was a professor at Howard University, and in 1956 was named to head the history department at Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York. Recruited to the University of Chicago in 1964, he eventually led the history department and was appointed to a named chair. He then moved to Duke University in 1983, as an appointee to a named chair in history.

He was the seventh of ten children born to David and Milley Franklin. David was a former slave, who became a Chickasaw Freedman when emancipated after the American Civil War. Milley was born free before the war and was of one-fourth Choctaw and three-fourths African-American ancestry. Buck Franklin became a lawyer. Buck Franklin is best known for defending African-American survivors of the 1921 Tulsa race riot, in which whites had attacked many blacks and buildings, and burned and destroyed the Greenwood District.

Career \\"My challenge,\\" Franklin said, \\"was to weave into the fabric of American history enough of the presence of blacks so that the story of the United States could be told adequately and fairly.\\" In his autobiography, Franklin has described a series of formative incidents in which he confronted racism while seeking to volunteer his services at the beginning of the Second World War. He responded to the navy's search for qualified clerical workers, but after he presented his extensive qualifications, the navy recruiter told him that he was the wrong color for the position. He was similarly unsuccessful in finding a position with a War Department historical project. When he went to have a blood test, as required for the draft, the doctor initially refused to allow him into his office. Afterward, Franklin took steps to avoid the draft, on the basis that the country did not respect him or have an interest in his well-being, because of his color. In the early 1950s, Franklin served on the NAACP Legal Defense Fund team led by Thurgood Marshall, and helped develop the sociological case for Brown v. Board of Education. This case, challenging de jure segregated education in the South, was taken to the United States Supreme Court. It ruled in 1954 that the legal segregation of black and white children in public schools was unconstitutional, leading to integration of schools. =Professor and researcher= Franklin's teaching career\\"Obituary of John Hope Franklin,\\" John Hope Franklin Center, Duke University (retrieved May 23, 2014). began at Fisk University.

The studio has created visual effects and animations on over fifty feature films and commercials, garnering an Academy Award, four Clio Awards and two Emmy Awards. The company currently consists of approximately , with offices located in Berkeley, California. History Tippett Studio was founded in 1984 by Phil Tippett and Jules Roman, Phil's wife and the president of the company. The studio began as a stop motion animation company (by means of its particular stop motion animation variant, the so-called go motion animation technique). It also designed and built live action props for films, such as RoboCop, RoboCop 2, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Ghost. In 1991, the studio shifted its focus to computer-generated imagery to work on Jurassic Park, (released in 1993, with Industrial Light and Magic) by developing the Digital Input Device (DID). The DID was a new effects technology which placed computer-linked sensors into the moving joints of three-dimensional, articulated character models. This system earned Craig Hayes a Scientific and Technical Achievement Academy Award and the work on Jurassic Park earned the studio an Oscar. Creature animation work for Coneheads (also released in 1993) was the last go motion puppet project done by this company. The studio also worked on Blockbuster commercials featuring Ray and Carl, a guinea pig and rabbit at a pet store window from 2002 to 2007 during the Super Bowl. Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film Starship Troopers became at the time Tippett Studio's biggest project, with over 500 effects shots, for which the company received another Academy Award nomination. Phil Tippett co-directed the large-scale battle sequences with Verhoeven. The studio doubled in size to digitally animate and composite hundreds of creature shots for the film. Early in 2000, the studio re-teamed with Paul Verhoeven on Hollow Man. Craig Hayes co-supervised the creation of the invisible Sebastian whose outline becomes visible in steam, rain, water and even blood. The outstanding visual effects were recognized with another Academy Award nomination.

She was the second wife of Emperor Huan.  Family background  Deng Mengn√º's father Deng Xiang (ÈÑßÈ¶ô) was a low level official in the imperial administration. (It is not clear under which emperor(s) he served.) He was a cousin of Empress Deng Sui and therefore a grandson of the statesman Deng Yu. Deng Mengn√º's mother was named Xuan (ÂÆ£). Deng Xiang died early, and after he did, Lady Xuan remarried Liang Ji (Ê¢ÅÁ¥Ä‚Äînote different character than the Liang Ji referenced below), the uncle of Sun Shou (Â≠´Â£Ω), the wife of the powerful official Liang Ji (Ê¢ÅÂÜÄ), who dominated the political scene throughout the reigns of Emperor Huan and his two predecessors, Emperors Chong and Zhi, as the brother of the regent Empress Dowager Liang.  Marriage to Emperor Huan  After Lady Xuan remarried, Deng Mengn√º lived for a while with her mother and her stepfather. Because she was beautiful, Liang Ji and Sun Shou had offered her to Emperor Huan to be an imperial consort‚Äîand adopted her and changed her family name to Liang. After the death of Liang Ji's sister Empress Liang N√ºying in 159, Liang Ji was hopeful to continue to use her to control Emperor Huan and hoped that she would become empress. To completely control her, Liang Ji planned to have her mother, Lady Xuan, killed, and in fact sent assassins against her, but the assassination was foiled by the powerful eunuch Yuan She (Ë¢ÅËµ¶), a neighbor of Lady Xuan. This set in motion a series of events that led to Liang Ji's downfall, as Emperor Huan, angry about the assassination attempt, formed a conspiracy with five powerful eunuchs and overthrew Liang in a coup d'etat later in 159. The Liang and Sun clans were slaughtered. After the fall of the Liang clan, later in 159, Emperor Huan created then-Consort Liang empress, but disliked her family name, and so ordered her family name be changed to Bo (ËñÑ). Only later did the emperor find out that she was actually Deng Xiang's daughter, and therefore had her original family name of Deng restored. A number of her uncles and cousins were promoted to important positions but not given much real power.  Downfall and death  For a while, Emperor Huan greatly favored the beautiful Empress Deng. However, his affection was not undivided, and he had a large number of other favorites, including Consorts Guo and Tian. Empress Deng became very arrogant and jealous, and she and Consort Guo engaged in a series of false accusations against each other. In 165, Emperor Huan decided to rid himself of Empress Deng and ordered her deposed and imprisoned. She died in anger and depression. Her relatives who were promoted when she became empresses were removed from their positions, and her uncles Deng Wanshi (ÈÑßËê¨‰∏ñ) and Deng Hui (ÈÑßÊúÉ) were executed.

It is the sixth (and final) release in the GIPF project of six abstract strategy games, although it is considered the fifth game in the project. It was released in 2005. P√úNCT won the Games Magazine Best Abstract Strategy game for 2007. Overview The P√úNCT board game is one of six games a part of the GIPF project. This project was created by Kris Burm and is a series of six abstract games. P√úNCT is the 5th game of the project and the board of this game is shaped like a hexagon. This game was released in 2005. P√úNCT is a two-player connection game. The objective is to connect two sides of a hexagonal board, using pieces which cover three hexes each. The pieces can be placed, moved, rotated, and stacked in various ways, restricted by the geometry of the board, the shape of the pieces, and gravity. Players can bring new pieces to the board or can attempt to connect the pieces already . The objective of the game is to mislead the opponent. Game rules When the players take their first turn, they are not able to use the central hexagon. The P√úNCT piece is used as a point of reference throughout the game, but the P√úNCT piece can't be moved when the player is making a move. Minor dots can land on the other player's piece, but the P√úNCT piece may not. In order to make a move, three dots must be in perfect alignment. The pieces that are on top of all of the other pieces have the most power in this game. The dots on the ends of the pieces must be at the same level horizontally to play this game correctly. In order to make a bridge in this game, you must perform a jump move on a piece already on the board. The positions of the dots at the end don't have to be aligned with the middle or stable horizontally. When determining the winner, a player can lift one piece at a time to determine if a connection was made. To connect opposite sides in this game, players can move pieces on top of other pieces or they can stack pieces to block the opponent's connection, ergo, making a connection for themselves. The actual P√úNCT piece, which is a rounded piece that has one point, cannot be used to make a connection or form a ‚Äúchain‚Äù but rather used as a point of reference. =Winning= If the dots or a P√úNCT piece are adjacent or across from each other at any level, the player has successfully made a connection. Another way to win, in the case of a tie-breaker, is to control the most spaces on the board. A pro tip for winning is to move the pieces as close to the center as possible.

Following his first, supporting appearance in The Crime at Black Dudley (1929), it is the first of many novels starring the mysterious Albert Campion, and introduces his butler/valet/bodyguard Magersfontein Lugg. Plot introduction Crossing the Atlantic on the luxurious liner Elephantine are an American judge, Crowdy Lobbett, and his children. A number of people around Judge Lobbett have been murdered, and he is said to be fleeing to England for safety. Apparent buffoon Albert Campion offers the family sanctuary with his friends in remote Suffolk, but a local commits suicide, the Judge vanishes, and another disappearance follows soon after. What is the Judge's mysterious secret? How was he kidnapped from a remote maze? Can Campion and his friends get to the bottom of things before it's too late? Plot summary When Campion saves him from certain death on the ship over, Judge Lobbett looks into the man's background, and is advised to trust him. So, he takes Campion's advice and brings his handsome son and pretty daughter down to Mystery Mile, a tiny village on a near-island on the Suffolk coast, where Campion's friends Biddy and Giles Paget own a run-down manor house. The night they arrive, a roving fortune-teller visits, and soon afterward the local Rector \\"St.\\" Swithin Cush, a mild and much-loved man, commits gruesome suicide, leaving a note and some mysterious clues‚Äîa red knight from his chess set, and the word \\"Danger\\" in encrypted form. Settling in at the manor, the judge calls in an art expert to inspect a possible masterpiece, but as the man (an annoying bore they had encountered on the boat) arrives at the house, the judge vanishes, seemingly inexplicably, while exploring the maze. They search for the judge's secret knowledge, the clue to the identity of crime boss Simister, which has brought such danger, but find only a large box of children's books. Travelling to London to investigate the judge's enemies, and to shake off art expert Barber, Campion and Lobbett's son Marlowe are recalled by a shocking telegram, but find the local Post Office man has exaggerated things‚Äînot a body, but Judge Lobbett's clothes, have been found. Next day, Biddy disappears, and Campion soon sees that the shopkeeper is behind it. Thos. T Knapp, a low-class criminal of Campion's acquaintance, arrives with news of their enemies, and they all decamp to London to rescue Biddy, leaving Lobbett's daughter safe in Campion's flat. They break into the house of the fortune-teller, where Biddy is being cruelly interrogated, and after a fight and Campion's use of a smoke-bomb, escape, leaving the gang in disarray. Back at Campion's flat, they see a photo of the judge in a newspaper, and Campion reveals that he had arranged for the disappearance, and hidden the man on a nearby estate, following St. Swithin's advice. They go there, fetch the judge, and he, Giles and Campion decamp for Mystery Mile once more, where they find the household, including Mr Barber, drugged. They retrieve the judge's evidence‚Äîa book of stories from the Thousand and One Nights from his set‚Äîand Giles and the judge flee using the same path used to smuggle the judge away before, a boat from a beach near some dangerous \\"soft\\" ‚Äì mud that works like quicksand. Campion sits in the hut and deciphers the clue‚Äîthe art expert's name is Ali Barber. The man comes in, and reveals his secret role as Simister, head of a colossal criminal gang, inherited from his father. He tries to kill Campion with a syringe filled with acid, but Campion breaks through the floor of the hut and falls beneath it. Barber goes to retrieve the book, but is taken by the soft mud, dying horribly. Recuperating later, Campion's friend Stanislaus Oates tells him the secret of Swithin Cush's suicide ‚Äì he was in fact not a parson at all, having taken the place of his brother who died young. The fortune-teller, a blackmailer working for Simister, knew this and threatened to reveal it. Biddy and Giles Paget plan to marry Marlowe and Isopel Lobbett, respectively, and to sell the valuable painting for a small fortune. Characters in \\"Mystery Mile\\" * Albert Campion, mysterious but amiable adventurer * Magersfontein Lugg, Campion's servant, a beefy ex-crook * Giles Paget, owner of the manor on Mystery Mile, a friend of Campion * Biddy Paget, Giles' sister, whom Campion admires * Addlepate, originally owned by Campion but now the Paget's dog * Crowdy Lobbett, an American judge, scourge of gangsters * Marlowe Lobbett, his handsome son * Isopel Lobbett, his attractive daughter * Swithin Cush, rector of Mystery Mile, a friend of the Pagets * Ali Ferguson Barber, art collector and bore * Thos. T Knapp, low-class London criminal, known to (but despised by) Campion Literary significance and criticism The setting, a semi-island called Mystery Mile, is based on Mersea Island, Essex, where Allingham spent some time in her youth, and set her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick. The book includes some hints about Campion's background. His real first name is \\"Rudolph\\", and his last name begins with \\"K\\". Campion looks enough like some Very Important Person to impersonate him on a trip to Asia. These hints appear off and on throughout many other Campion novels. Campion's affection for Biddy, and jealousy of Marlowe Lobbett, is quite apparent throughout, though never explicitly stated. Campion's thoughts turn to Biddy again in Look to the Lady. The character of Simister bears a striking similarity to Keyser S√∂ze, a fictional character in the 1995 film The Usual Suspects ‚Äî an all powerful crime lord, operating entirely through minions so that he himself is never exposed, thought by many to be a myth, to have existed too long to be a single man, and originating from the Middle East. Television adaptations The story was adapted for television by the BBC, the last of eight Campion stories starring Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg. Originally broadcast as two separate hour-long episodes, the original UK air date was 9 March 1990. The series was shown in the United States by PBS.

In organic chemistry an enol ether is an alkene with an alkoxy substituent. The general structure is R2C=CR-OR where R = H, alkyl or aryl. A common subfamily of enol ethers are vinyl ethers, with the formula ROCH=CH2. Important enol ethers include the reagent 3,4-dihydropyran and the monomers methyl vinyl ether and ethyl vinyl ether. Reactions and uses Akin to enamines, enol ethers are electron-rich alkenes by virtue of the electron- donation from the heteroatom via pi-bonding. Enol ethers have oxonium ion character. By virtue of their bonding situation, enol ethers display distinctive reactivity. In comparison with simple alkenes, enol ethers exhibit enhanced susceptibility to attack by electrophiles such as Bronsted acids. Similarly, they undergo inverse demand Diels-Alder reactions. 352px The reactivity of enol ethers is highly dependent on the presence of substituents alpha to oxygen. The vinyl ethers are susceptible to polymerization to give polyvinyl ethers. Some vinyl ethers also find some use as inhalation anesthetics. Enol ethers bearing Œ± substituents do not polymerize readily. They are mainly of academic interest, e.g. as intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules.

Ernest Hemingway was deeply impressed with Markham's writing, saying Markham was the first person to fly the Atlantic east to west in a solo non-stop flight (a westbound flight requires more endurance, fuel, and time than the eastward journey, because the craft must travel against the prevailing Atlantic winds). When Markham decided to take on the Atlantic crossing, no pilot had yet flown non-stop from Europe to New York, and no woman had made the westward flight solo, though several had died trying. Markham hoped to claim both records. On 4 September 1936, she took off from Abingdon, England. After a 20-hour flight, her Vega Gull, The Messenger, suffered fuel starvation due to icing of the fuel tank vents, and she crash-landed at Baleine Cove on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Career Haverty played for Home Farm and St Patrick's Athletic before signing for Arsenal in July 1954. He almost immediately made his debut, while still only 18, against Everton on 25 August 1954, though he only managed another six matches that season, and eight the one after that. His breakthrough in the Arsenal side came in 1956‚Äì57, as he became the Gunners' first choice left-winger, playing 32 times and scoring 9 goals. By now he had also made his debut for the Republic of Ireland, against the Netherlands on 10 May 1955. Haverty also played in the London XI that contested the inaugural edition of the Inter- Cities Fairs Cup. He played against Lausanne Sports in the semi-finals (and scored a goal in the 3‚Äì2 aggregate win), he did not make the cut for the final against Barcelona, which London lost 6‚Äì1 on aggregate. Back trouble meant he missed some of Arsenal's matches during this time, but put in 37 appearances and 8 goals in 1959‚Äì60, his best season for the club. However, the next season he was made to share the left wing position with Alan Skirton. Haverty was unhappy with the lack of a regular first-team place, and put in a transfer request; he was sold to Blackburn Rovers in August 1961 for ¬£25,000. In all, he played 122 matches for Arsenal, scoring 26 goals. Haverty spent a single season with Blackburn, before having spells in the lower divisions with Millwall and Bristol Rovers, with a brief spell at Celtic in between. He moved back to his native Ireland to play for Shelbourne, with whom he won the last of his 32 full international caps. In 1967 he went to the United States to play for Chicago Spurs (later Kansas City Spurs) in the NASL, and then returned to sign for Shamrock Rovers in 1969, for whom he made two appearances in the European Cup Winners' Cup.

Biography Crichton was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and grew up in Bronxville, New York. Robert Crichton's father, Kyle Crichton, was a writer/editor at Collier's magazine with experience as a coal miner and steel worker; he wrote novels and biographies (including a biography of the Marx Brothers) and also wrote for The New Masses and the Daily Worker under the name Robert Forsythe, publishing a collection of articles that was entitled Redder Than the Rose. Crichton joined the army and served in the infantry during World War II, and was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. Before returning to the States, he ran an ice cream factory on the outskirts of Paris; it was, he said, his decompression chamber. He attended Harvard University on the GI Bill and was a member of the famed class of 1950. Robert Crichton's first book, The Great Impostor, published in 1959, was the true, if picaresque, story of Fred Demara, an impostor who successfully assumed scores of guises including serving as a Trappist monk, a Texas prison warden and a practicing surgeon in the Royal Canadian Navy. The book was a bestseller and adapted into a successful 1961 film with Tony Curtis in the starring role. Crichton's second book, The Rascal and the Road, was a memoir about his escapades with Demara. The non-fiction books were \\"hack-work\\", he said, written to support a growing family. In 1966, he published his first novel, The Secret of Santa Vittoria. The New York Times critic Orville Prescott wrote: \\"If I had my way the publication of Robert Crichton's brilliant novel...would be celebrated with fanfares of trumpets, with the display of banners and with festivals in the streets.\\" The book was on the New York Times bestseller list for over 50 weeks, spending 18 of them at the top of the list,John Bear, The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992, p. 97 and became an international bestseller. Set in an Italian hill-town and telling the story of local resistance to the Nazis during World War II, the novel was adapted into a Golden Globe winning film of the same name in 1969. Crichton's second and last novel, The Camerons, published by Knopf in 1972, was drawn from the lives of his great grandparents, a Scottish coal mining family. It too was a bestseller. He had intended to write a sequel, but the work was never completed. Among countless magazine articles, he was best known for an essay \\"Our Air War,\\" about Frank Harvey's book, Air War: Vietnam published by The New York Review of Books, in 1968.Our Air War by Robert Crichton, The New York Review of Books, January 4, 1968 Crichton died in 1993 in New Rochelle, New York, at the age of 68. Family Crichton was married to Judy Crichton, the first woman documentary producer at CBS Reports, CBS's documentary unit, and the founding executive producer of the PBS historical documentary series, The American Experience. They had four children: Sarah Crichton, publisher and writer; Rob Crichton, lawyer; Jennifer Crichton, teacher and writer. Susan Crichton is deceased. A brother, Andrew S.

It was later described in the Shulgins' popular 1991 book PIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. PIHKAL Glossary excerpts Usage Shulgin Ratings typically include three components. An identification of the chemical being ingested, a dosage, and a descriptive narrative including the ratings themselves used to describe various moments in time. The chemical itself must be clearly identified, preferably using chemical nomenclature, as opposed to popular or \\"street\\" names. The dosage must be known and communicated, as substances may result in wildly different ratings at different doses. The rating itself gives a comparable value relating to the subjective intensity of the experience, including auditory, visual, emotional, mental, physical and other sensory effects.

He is credited with invention of various kinds of surgical operations and developing his own technique of using plaster casts to treat fractured bones. Biography =Childhood and training= Nikolay Pirogov was born in Moscow, the 13th of 14 children of Ivan Ivanovich Pirogov (born around 1772), a major in the commissary service and a treasurer at the Moscow Food Depot whose own father came from peasants and served as a soldier in Peter the Great's army before retiring and opening a brewery in Moscow; Pirogov's mother Elizaveta Ivanovna Pirogova (nee Novikova) belonged to an old Moscow merchant family and was four years younger than her husband.Solomon Shtreich (2016).

His Life and Meetings in Portraits and Illustrations. ‚Äî Leningrad: Medgiz, p. 2 He learned to read in several languages as a child. His father died in 1824, leaving his family destitute. Pirogov originally intended to become a civil servant, but the family doctor Yefrem Mukhin who was a professor of anatomy and physiology at the Imperial Moscow University persuaded the authorities to accept a 14-old Pirogov as a student. In 1828 he finished the Faculty of Medicine and entered the Imperial University of Dorpat where he studied under Professor Moyer (who, in return, studied under Antonio Scarpa) and received a doctorate on ligation of the ventral aorta in 1832. In May 1833, he travelled to Berlin, meeting such surgeons as Karl Ferdinand von Graefe, Johann Nepomuk Rust and Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach at the University of Berlin. Professor Bernhard von Langenbeck taught Pirogov how to properly use the scalpel. Pirogov also visited the University of G√∂ttingen and on his return served as a professor at the University of Dorpat (1836‚Äî1840). =Years as doctor and field surgeon= In October 1840, Pirogov took up an appointment as professor of surgery at the Imperial Academy of Military Medicine in Saint Petersburg, and undertook three years of military service in this period. He first used ether as an anaesthetic in 1847, and investigated cholera from 1848. Around this time he compiled his anatomical atlas, Topographical anatomy of the human body (vol. 1‚Äì4, 1851‚Äì1854). Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855 He worked as an army surgeon in the Crimean War, arriving in Simferopol on December 11, 1854. From his works in the Crimea, he is considered to be the father of field surgery. He followed work by Louis-Joseph Seutin in introducing plaster casts for setting broken bones, and developed a new osteoplastic method for amputation of the foot, known as the \\"Pirogov amputation\\". He was also the first to use anesthesia in the field, particularly during the siege of Sevastopol, and he introduced a system of triage into five categories. He encouraged female volunteers as an organised corps of nurses, the Khrestovozdvizhenskaya (ru) at the Saint Petersburg Charity Encyclopedia community of nurses established by Grand Duchess Yelena Pavlovna in 1854Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855. =Return and retirement= Portrait of Nikolay Pirogov by Ilya Repin, 1881 In 1856 after the end of war he returned to Saint Petersburg and withdrew from the academy following the suggestion to work as a superintendent of schools of the Odessa Educational District which united several governorates. He wrote an influential paper on the problems of pedagogy, arguing for the education of the poor, non-Russians, and women. (He was influential in his family's decision to educate his niece Henriette Joudra who would go on to earn her medical doctorate and become the first woman to open a private medical practice in Geneva, Switzerland). He also argued against early specialisation, and for the development of secondary schools. In 1858 he received the rank of Privy Councillor and was transferred to Kiev as a superintendent of schools of the Kiev Educational District after disagreements with the Odessa governor general. In 1861 he became a member of the Main Directorate of Schools, serving at the Ministry of National Education up until his death. Same year he bought an estate in the Vishnya village near Vinnytsia. In 1862, he took charge of a delegation of Russian students sent overseas to prepare for professorship. He lived in Heidelberg and at one point treated Giuseppe Garibaldi's injury sustained at Aspromonte on 28 August. In 1866 upon return to Russia he settled down at his estate, treating local peasants and establishing a free clinic. In 1870 he visited the battlefields and field hospitals of the Franco‚ÄìPrussian War as a representative of the Russian Red Cross, and in 1877‚Äî1878 spent several months working as a field surgeon during the Russo-Turkish War, treating both Russian and Bulgarian soldiers and organizing field hospitals. In 1879 he published The Old Physician's Diary and \\"Questions of Life\\". He last appeared in public on 24 May 1881 and died later that year at his Vishnya estate, Podolian Governorate (modern-day Vinnytsia, Ukraine). His body is preserved using embalming techniques he himself developed, and rests in a church in Vinnytsia. Compared to the corpse of Lenin, which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging: it is said that only dust has to be brushed off of it. It resides at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin's body is preserved at a constant low temperature).  Legacy  Soviet 1960 stamp, published during his 150th anniversary Nikolay Pirogov was from 1847 corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and received in 1844, 1851 and 1860 the Demidov Prize by the academy. He was appointed honorary citizen of Moscow in 1881. The Pirogov Society was founded four years after his death, which aims for better medical training and treatment in Russia. The Pirogov Museum is located in Vinnytsia, Ukraine at his former estate and clinic. Near this 1947 building is a mausoleum which is used as a family chapel and in which his embalmed body is visible in public. Pirogov Glacier in Antarctica,Pirogov Glacier.

Biography  Burman is of Polish-Jewish descent, and he was born and raised in Buenos Aires. He holds both Argentine and Polish citizenship, like his films' character, Ariel. He studied law before changing to audiovisual media production. In 1995, he launched his own production company together with Diego Dubcovsky, BD Cine (Burman and Dubcovsky Cine). Burman is also a founding member of the Academy of Argentine Cinema.Brooks, Brian. indieWIRE interview: Daniel Burman, December 6, 2006. His loose trilogy of films, Esperando al Mes√≠as (2000), El Abrazo Partido (2004), and Derecho de Familia (2006), were all written and directed by Burman and star Uruguayan actor Daniel Hendler. They are largely autobiographical, dealing with the life of a young neurotic Jew in contemporary Buenos Aires. He frequently collaborates with other Argentine Jews, notably writer and klezmer musician Marcelo Birmajer, and C√©sar Lerner. His comedic touches often bring comparison to Woody Allen, a comparison Burman is quick to reject. He said, \\"It's not a measurable comparison. But I'm very happy with it. I admire him more than anyone else in the world.\\"Taylor, Ella. Phoenix New Times, \\"Family Ties: For Argentine director Daniel Burman, life is a movie,\\" January 4, 2007. Burman's films have been featured in many film festivals around the world. El abrazo partido (2003) took the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival, as well as best actor for Hendler. Burman was co-producer of the successful 2004 film, The Motorcycle Diaries, as well as Garage Olimpo (1999).  Opinions on filmmaking  In an interview with Brian Brooks, who writes for indieWIRE.com, an online community of independent filmmakers and aficionados, Burman discussed his approach to filmmaking. He said: \\"I don't have goals when I make a film, except to create as faithfully as possible the story I wanted to tell, and that the sensations that provoked me to tell the story are also caused when reading the script.\\"Brooks, Brian. Ibid. \\"I don't love film in itself; it's not like I was debating the merits of using different types of camera-work, like traveling shots. I love film because it's a story-telling tool,\\" he said in an interview he did for TimesSquare.com.Balfour, Brad. TimesSquare.com, interview, \\"Argentinian Director Daniel Burman on Law and Family,\\" page two, 2007.  Interconnections between films  It is arguable that the loose trilogy of films ‚Äî Esperando al Mes√≠as (2000), El Abrazo Partido (2003), and Derecho de Familia (2006) ‚Äî happen in the same \\"universe\\". The three share common traits: They are written and directed by Burman and all star Daniel Hendler in the title role as a young Jew. Additionally, several actors and actresses appear twice in the films. Because Hendler's characters share similar traits (they are all named Ariel: Ariel Goldstein, Ariel Makaroff and Ariel Perelman respectively) and because some characters from one film seem to appear in another, the trilogy is usually considered as happening in the same universe Several continuity changes show that the three Ariels are different people: In the first movie, Ariel's father is a restaurant owner, and his mother dies; in the second film, his father has been long gone, and his mother tends to a small shop; in the third movie, his father dies in the film, and his mother has been long dead. However, a character named Estela from the first film appears in the second, and is both times played by Melina Petriella. This at least connects the first two movies to the same universe. Additionally, Juan Jos√© Flores Quispe appears in the second and third movie as \\"Ram√≥n\\". Although his character, unlike Estela, varies from film to film, this suggests that the second and third film also share the same universe and, thus, the trilogy itself is set in the same storyline, with the \\"Ariel persona\\" showing either different aspects of the same character or simply being a mere coincidence.

This colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor is a strongly basic amine. It is a widely used building block in chemical synthesis, with approximately 500,000 tonnes produced in 1998.Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke \\"Amines, Aliphatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim. Ethylenediamine readily reacts with moisture in humid air to produce a corrosive, toxic and irritating mist, to which even short exposures can cause serious damage to health (see safety). Ethylenediamine is the first member of the so-called polyethylene amines. Synthesis Ethylenediamine is produced industrially by treating 1,2-dichloroethane with ammonia under pressure at 180 ¬∞C in an aqueous medium:Hans-J√ºrgen Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 6. Auflage (2007), Seite 245, Wiley VCH :400px In this reaction hydrogen chloride is generated, which forms a salt with the amine. The amine is liberated by addition of sodium hydroxide and can then be recovered by . Diethylenetriamine (DETA) and triethylenetetramine (TETA) are formed as by-products. Another industrial route to ethylenediamine involves the reaction of ethanolamine and ammonia:Hans-J√ºrgen Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 6. Auflage (2007), Seite 275, Wiley VCH :400px This process involves passing the gaseous reactants over a bed of nickel heterogeneous catalysts. Ethylenediamine can be purified by treatment with sodium hydroxide to remove water followed by distillation. Applications Ethylenediamine is used in large quantities for production of many industrial chemicals. It forms derivatives with carboxylic acids (including fatty acids), nitriles, alcohols (at elevated temperatures), alkylating agents, carbon disulfide, and aldehydes and ketones. Because of its bifunctional nature, having two amines, it readily forms heterocycles such as imidazolidines. =Precursor to chelation agents, drugs, and agrochemicals= A most prominent derivative of ethylenediamine is the chelating agent EDTA, which is derived from ethylenediamine via a Strecker synthesis involving cyanide and formaldehyde. Hydroxyethylethylenediamine is another commercially significant chelating agent. Numerous bio-active compounds and drugs contain the N-CH2-CH2-N linkage, including some antihistamines. Salts of ethylenebisdithiocarbamate are commercially significant fungicides under the brand names Maneb, Mancozeb, Zineb, and Metiram. Some imidazoline-containing fungicides are derived from ethylenediamine. =Pharmaceutical ingredient= Ethylenediamine is an ingredient in the common bronchodilator drug aminophylline, where it serves to solubilize the active ingredient theophylline. Ethylenediamine has also been used in dermatologic preparations, but has been removed from some because of causing contact dermatitis. When used as a pharmaceutical excipient, after oral administration its bioavailability is about 0.34, due to a substantial first-pass effect. Less than 20% is eliminated by renal excretion. Ethylenediamine-derived antihistamines are the oldest of the five classes of first-generation antihistamines, beginning with piperoxan aka benodain, discovered in 1933 at the Pasteur Institute in France, and also including mepyramine, tripelennamine, and antazoline. The other classes are derivatives of ethanolamine, alkylamine, piperazine, and others (primarily tricyclic and tetracyclic compounds related to phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, as well as the cyproheptadine-phenindamine family) =Role in polymers= Ethylenediamine, because it contains two amine groups, is a widely used precursor to various polymers. Condensates derived from formaldehyde are plasticizers. It is widely used in the production of polyurethane fibers. The PAMAM class of dendrimers are derived from ethylenediamine. =Tetraacetylethylenediamine= The bleaching activator tetraacetylethylenediamine is generated from ethylenediamine. The derivative N,N-ethylenebis(stearamide) (EBS) is a commercially significant mold-release agent and a surfactant in gasoline and motor oil. =Other applications= *as a solvent, it is miscible with polar solvents and is used to solubilize proteins such as albumins and casein. It is also used in certain electroplating baths. *as a corrosion inhibitor in paints and coolants. *ethylenediamine dihydroiodide (EDDI) is added to animal feeds as a source of iodide. *chemicals for color photography developing, binders, adhesives, fabric softeners, curing agents for epoxies, and dyes. *as a compound to sensitize nitromethane into an explosive. This mixture was used at Picatinny Arsenal during WWII, giving the nitromethane and ethylenediamine mixture the nickname PLX, or Picatinny Liquid Explosive. Coordination chemistry Ethylenediamine is a well-known bidentate chelating ligand for coordination compounds, with the two nitrogen atoms donating their lone pairs of electrons when ethylenediamine acts as a ligand. It is often abbreviated \\"en\\" in inorganic chemistry. The complex [Co(ethylenediamine)3]3+ is an archetypical chiral tris-chelate complex. The salen ligands, some of which are used in catalysis, are derived from the condensation of salicylaldehydes and ethylenediamine. =Related ligands= Related derivatives of ethylenediamine include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), and tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA). Chiral analogs of ethylenediamine include 1,2-diaminopropane and trans-diaminocyclohexane. Safety Ethylenediamine, like ammonia and other low-molecular weight amines, is a skin and respiratory irritant. Unless tightly contained, liquid ethylenediamine will release toxic and irritating vapors into its surroundings, especially on heating. The vapors react with moisture in humid air to form a characteristic white mist, which is extremely irritating to skin, eyes, lungs and mucus membranes.

Early years Vega was born in the town of Salinas, Puerto Rico where he received his primary education. He was born into a family of musicians and therefore learned how to play the bongos and conga at an early age. In 1967, when he was 10 years old, he played the conga for a kids band called \\"La Prefeida\\". His family moved to New York City in 1968. In New York, Vega continued to go to school. In his free time however, he played the conga for various local Latin rock bands including \\"City Trash\\". Latin music was very popular in New York during the 1970s and while Vega played the conga for Latin rock bands, he started to become more and more interested in the afroantillano style of music better known as salsa. He listened to and was influenced by Ismael Rivera, Rafael Cortijo, Rafael Ithier and El Gran Combo. FOR THE RECORD: Tony Vega started as a member of Orquesta La preferida from 1971 to 1973. He was the primary conga player and sang coro . One year when the school season ended his parents sent him for vacation to the states for the two months of the school recess . Upon returning to Puerto Rico and back into the band there was a replacement on the conga tacking his place. I suggested to tony to go up front and try singing as he had done coro for the band quite well. And his singing career was started. he remained with the band and recorded a 45 rpm record under the supervision of the famed Pijuan (melon records ) director of the great Pijuan y su sexteto. he also did come coro while a member of Willie Rosario orquesta with Gilbertito Santarosa on a two songs recorded by orquesta La Preferida for the late promotor Rueben haddock. His voice can be heard on the CD \\"al fin contra viento y marea \\" by la Preferida . this information is confirmed by Eddie Maldonado Director Orquesta La Preferida . La Selecta In 1978, after he graduated from high school, Vega auditioned and was accepted by \\"La Selecta\\" a well known salsa band directed by Raphy Leavitt. He sang with the band and recorded \\"Cosquillita\\" (Tickle) \\"Sheila Taina\\" and \\"El Picaflor\\", which became \\"hits\\". In 1980, Vega was doing a show with La Selecta and in the audience was another salsa bandleader, Willie Rosario. Rosario was impressed with Vega and invited him to join his band. He did and participated in many recordings, and from 1981 to 1986, he shared credits with a young singer by the name of Gilberto Santa Rosa. Vega also played an essential role in the recording of \\"La Nueva Cosecha\\" (The New Harvest) which was nominated for a Grammy Award. He stayed with Rosario for eight years. In 1986, Vega joined the Louie Ramirez band before returning to Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, he was introduced to Eddie Palmieri by his friend Giovanni Hidalgo. Palmieri recorded Vega and ended up hiring him because he liked what he heard. Vega participated in the recording of \\"La Verdad\\" (The Truth)which won a Grammy for Palmieri. He traveled with the band to Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, (Germany), Denmark, and Yugoslavia. Solo career In 1988, Vega formed his own band and recorded \\"solo\\" for the first time. His album \\"Yo me Quedo\\" (I will stay) became a \\"hit'. He then followed that with the recording of the album \\"Lo Mio es Amor\\" (My thing is Love) which included the songs \\"Ella\\" (She) and an English language track \\"Love is Forever\\". This album earned him his first Gold Record Award. In 1991, Vega won a Platinum Record Award with the success of his album \\"Uno Mismo\\" (Oneself). That year he performed in Venezuela and later went to New York where in Madison Square Garden he participated in Tito Puentes 100th recording \\"The Mambo King\\". Recognitions In 1992, he was awarded La Husca Award in Panama and in Puerto Rico won the Ag√ºeyban√° de Oro Award for Best Orchestra of the Year. That same year Vega and his band performed in Spain, Chile, Colombia and the United States. He was also among a committee sent to Spain by the Government of Puerto Rico to represent the island when it was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award. He performed in the Sports Palace of Madrid. In 1996, Vega participated with Marc Anthony in the opening ceremonies of the 7th Gymnastics World Championships celebrated in Puerto Rico.

It was located just outside the village of Os√∏yro, south of the city of Bergen. It was established in June 1940 during the German occupation of Norway, and it was the first prison camp in Norway. It was designated a ' (police detention camp), under the administration of the Nazi \\"security police\\" (Sicherheitspolizei, SIPO). Initially, prisoners were Jews and communists, but a broader array of members from prosecuted groups began arriving at the camp. Conditions were relatively benign until 1942, when Otmar Holenia, nicknamed \\"the Storm\\", took command and imposed harsher conditions. Ulven was used for purposes of executing individuals for various reasons. It is not known how many were murdered in the camp. In the course of the summer of 1943, the prisoners at Ulven were used as slave labor to build the Espeland concentration camp in Bergen, to which the prisoners were transferred.

Elaiussa (ŒïŒªŒ±ŒπŒøœçœÉŒ±), derives from the word elaion (·ºîŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ), meaning oil in Greek (Elaiussa had many olive trees). It was founded in the 2nd century B.C. on a tiny island attached to the mainland by a narrow isthmus in the Mediterranean Sea. Besides the cultivation of olives, the settlement here of the Cappadocian king Archelaus during the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus played a role in the development of the city. Founding a new city on the isthmus, Archelaus called it Sebaste, which is the Greek equivalent word of the Latin \\"Augusta\\". The city entered a golden age when the Roman Emperor Vespasian purged Cilicia of pirates in 74 AD. Towards the end of the 3rd century AD however its importance began to wane, owing in large part to incursions by the Sassanian King Shapur I in 260 and later by the Isaurians. The ancient sources tell the history of city's existence and how the churches and basilicas survived into the late Roman and early Byzantine periods. When its neighbor Corycus began to flourish in the 6th century AD, Elaiussa Sebaste was slowly obliterated from the stage of history. The island that was the site of the first settlement here, where excavations have been underway since 1995 headed by Italian archeologist Eugenia Equini Schneider, is almost completely buried under sand. The original settlement, at a location that provided security for the harbors on either side, is a peninsula today. The ruins of a bath, a cistern, a defense wall and a breakwater can be seen on the side overlooking the western bay of the peninsula. But the most important remains unearthed in the city are a bath whose floor is paved with mosaics and a small basilica on a circular base. A building on the main street of city (east of the theater) On the opposite side of the highway that divides Elaiussa and Sebaste today stands a theater dating to the 2nd century AD, an extremely small structure with only 23 rows of seats, whose steps and decorations succumbed to centuries of plunder. Next to the theater is the agora, built in all great probability during the imperial period. At the entrance of the agora, which is surrounded by a semi-destroyed defense wall once rose two monumental fountains in the shape of lions. Inside the agora stands a large church, its floor is covered by sand to protect the mosaic pavement. Elaiussa's only temple stands outside the city on a hill overlooking the sea. Only two of the Corinthian columns of this temple, which had 12 on the long and 6 on the short side originally, are standing today. A large bath complex among the lemon groves between the temple and the agora was built by a technique characteristic of the ancient Roman period and little used in Anatolia. Ruins and Turkish village (1860) Grave of the Princess The ruins of Elaiussa Sebaste also harbor the richest and most impressive necropolis among the cities of ancient Cilicia. The \\"Avenue of Graves\\", located on a hill to the north of the city, preserves close to a hundred graves of various shapes and sizes scattered among the lemon trees. The aesthetic forms of these monumental graves of Cilicia Tracheia are remarkable. The ancient aqueducts that carried water to the ruins from the Lamos (\\"Lemon\\") river also adorn the city's two entrances. The aqueduct to the west of the city in particular is in relatively good condition. Centuries ago these aqueducts formed a canal system that ran all the way to Corycus. A lidded sarcophagus lies on a small rise exactly opposite the aqueduct. Known as \\"the Grave of the Princess\\", this sarcophagus is a prime example of the Anatolian tomb tradition.

The CWS mission is to eradicate hunger and poverty and to promote peace and justice at the national and international level through collaboration with partners abroad and in the US. Program areas CWS program areas mainly target education and advocacy, both of which are essential components in confronting the root causes of hunger. By raising awareness about hunger, poverty, water access, trade, human rights, climate change, peace building and other issues in its Speak Out alerts, CWS brings the voices and priorities of its partners and constituents into the halls of churches, community groups, and governments. Disaster Response When disaster strikes, CWS works with partners on the scene to provide shelter, food and water, blankets, recovery kits, counseling ‚Äì the basics needed to ensure the survival of individuals and communities at risk. In addition to rapid emergency disaster response, CWS also provides long-term development initiative, helping vulnerable families and communities prepare for and recover from natural and human-caused calamities. For example, in drought-ridden Ethiopia, CWS and partners are assisting 120,000 people with food and seeds to restart farming activities. In the United States, when disaster strikes, CWS dispatches disaster response specialists where needed in order to provide assistance to local interfaith groups assessing and responding to the material and spiritual needs of their communities. After Hurricanes Ike and Gustav hit the U.S. Gulf Coast, CWS reached out to its network of long-term recovery groups for project development support and also for provision of material resources such as CWS Blankets and Kits. Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, CWS has partnered with Habitat for Humanity and has invested in building long-term recovery capacity along the Gulf Coast. As a result of this collaboration more than 640 houses were repaired or rebuilt in the targeted area of the Gulf Coast. Assisting Refugees CWS helps meet the needs of refugees in protracted situations and those who are able to return home. It also serves tens of thousands of refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers in the U.S. and around the world each year with screening for potential resettlement to the U.S., chaplaincy, legal, and other professional services. Working with denominations and congregational co-sponsors, CWS and its network of resettlement affiliates have welcomed and found new homes in the U.S. for more than 450,000 refugees since 1946. Immigration CWS strongly supports comprehensive immigration reform and argued in 2014 that Congress \\"should enact immigration reform that will provide a permanent solution and a path to citizenship for all our undocumented community members.\\" CROP Hunger Walks Raleigh CROP Hunger Walk 2015 The largest fund-raising events for Church World Service are CROP Hunger Walks (Christian Rural Overseas Program ). The first CROP Hunger Walk was in the 1960s. Now more than 2,000 communities across the U.S. join in CROP Hunger Walks each year. A unique aspect of CROP Hunger Walks is that Church World Service doesn't receive all of the money raised. Up to 25% of the money donated is given to local hunger fighting agencies which include food banks and community gardens. Additionally, those sponsoring a walker can specify whether Church World Service or an alternative global hunger-fighting agency will receive the remaining 75% of the donation. Blankets+ Through the Blankets+ program, more than 8,000 congregations and groups enable CWS to respond to disasters and assist communities by providing the necessary tools needed to build sustainable lives. CWS Kits CWS Kits include hygiene kits, school kits, baby kits, and emergency clean-up buckets. Last year, with the support of affiliated congregations and religious groups, CWS provided 298,000 Kits in the United States and abroad. Church World Service earned a B+ rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy and was also named one of the Top 100 Highly Rated Charities by GiveSpot.com. CWS currently has a 3-star rating from Charity Navigator. On August 26, 2009 CWS was part of the 300+ Groups Ask Senate for Stronger Climate Bill letter to Senate.

As a television producer, he was responsible for the early popular music shows Six-Five Special, Oh Boy!, Boy Meets Girls and Wham!! TV series, the first UK teenage music programmes. Good managed some of the UK's first rock and roll stars, including Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde, Billy Fury, Jess Conrad and Cliff Richard. Early years Good was born in Greenford, London. He joined the BBC on the magazine-format show Six-Five Special. He wanted music and a lot of movement. To get his way, Good had sets built, but shortly before the show started, they were wheeled out of the way, and he filled the space with the milling audience and performers. Television then was live, so once the programme started, Good kept it all as impromptu as possible. The running order was sketched out on Friday morning, then the only complete run- through happened immediately before transmission. The show launched the hand jive and Good even wrote an instruction book, Hand Jive at Six-Five. None of the Six-Five Special productions shows was recorded (due to the then-existing procedure of destroying and erasing already filmed programmes to make room for new ones), but a low-budget film based on the show survives. Independent Television Although Good had given the BBC a show that was attracting 12 million viewers, he was being paid only ¬£18 a week. He left for independent television and launched Oh Boy! in June 1958 for the ITV franchise holder Associated British Corporation (ABC). After trial broadcasts in the Midlands, it went national, in direct competition with Six-Five Special on Saturday evenings. Six-Five Special stuck to its mix of rock, jazz, skiffle and crooners, but Good was in his rock 'n' roll element with Oh Boy! The programmes were broadcast from the Hackney Empire, London, and made a star of Cliff Richard, as well as showcasing Billy Fury in several editions. Oh Boy! was non-stop rock and roll. Each show was 26 minutes, and no song lasted more than a minute. When ITV replaced the show on 12 September 1959 with Boy Meets Girls, people wondered whether Good had lost his touch. He later claimed his wife persuaded him that rock 'n' roll was on the way out and to adopt a more middle of the road approach. In the early 1960s, he wrote a column for Disc, a weekly UK pop magazine. He has appeared on numerous TV shows such as The Monkees plus Hogan's Heroes and produced the rarely seen television special 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee starring the Monkees. Shindig! In 1964, he made a one-off programme Around the Beatles, but regular rock 'n' roll television had disappeared from British screens apart from Ready Steady Go, which made heavy use of Good's technique of building excitement and interest by allowing the audience to mill round the singers. Good championed the rise of rhythm & blues and went to the United States in 1962, where he spent $15,000 of his own money to produce a pilot show for the American market. After trying for a year to persuade television executives to take on the show, he gave up and returned to the UK. A year later, a disc jockey gave the tape of the pilot show to an American television executive, who sent for Good. This led to the broadcasting of the first Shindig! show, first broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on 16 September 1964. Shindig! had a half-hour spot until January 1965, when it was extended to an hour, before switching to twice- weekly half-hour episodes in the autumn. Occasional broadcasts were from London. Jack fell out with ABC executives and walked out. The show could not survive without Good's dynamic influence and it was cancelled in January 1966 to make room for screenings of the new Batman series. He was a subject of the British television programme This Is Your Life in March 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Music and musical theatre Good played and recorded with Lord Rockingham's XI. Their hit singles included \\"Fried Onions\\" and the better known UK Singles Chart #1, \\"Hoots Mon\\". He was a musical theatrical producer creating productions such as Good Rockin' Tonite. Oh Boy!, Elvis the Musical and Catch My Soul, which was also made into a film of the same name, released in 1974. He had a cameo appearance as an uptight naval officer in the comedy film Father Goose (1966). Art Good converted to Roman Catholicism and devoted his time to Christianity and icon painting, including a wall painting portraying the television as the Devil. His paintings have been exhibited at the Rancho de Chimay√≥ gallery alongside those of painter Antonio Roybal. He lived in New Mexico for many years, but returned to England to live in Oxfordshire. Death Good died from complications of a fall in Oxfordshire on 24 September 2017, at the age of 86.

The geodata underlying the map is considered the primary output of the project. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. Created by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data in the UK and elsewhere. Since then, it has grown to over two million registered users. Users may collect data using manual survey, GPS devices, aerial photography, and other free sources, or use their own local knowledge of the area. This crowdsourced data is then made available under the Open Database License. The site is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales. The data from OSM can be used in various ways including production of paper maps and electronic maps (similar to Google Maps, for example), geocoding of address and place names, and route planning. Prominent users include Facebook, Wikimedia Maps, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon Logistics, Uber, Craigslist, Snapchat, OsmAnd, Geocaching, MapQuest Open, JMP statistical software, and Foursquare. Many users of GPS devices use OSM data to replace the built-in map data on their devices. OpenStreetMap data has been favourably compared with proprietary datasources, although in 2009 data quality varied across the world. History The founder of OSM, Steve Coast, in 2009 Steve Coast founded the project in 2004, initially focusing on mapping the United Kingdom. In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the Ordnance Survey created massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them. The first contribution, made in the British city of London in 2005, was thought to be a road by the Directions Mag. In April 2006, the OpenStreetMap Foundation was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, Yahoo! confirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its aerial photography as a backdrop for map production. In April 2007, Automotive Navigation Data (AND) donated a complete road data set for the Netherlands and trunk road data for India and China to the project and by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users. Sponsors of the event included Google, Yahoo! and Multimap. In October 2007, OpenStreetMap completed the import of a US Census TIGER road dataset. In December 2007, Oxford University became the first major organisation to use OpenStreetMap data on their main website. Ways to import and export data have continued to grow ‚Äì by 2008, the project developed tools to export OpenStreetMap data to power portable GPS units, replacing their existing proprietary and out-of-date maps. In March, two founders announced that they have received venture capital funding of ‚Ç¨2.4million for CloudMade, a commercial company that uses OpenStreetMap data. In November 2010, Bing changed their licence to allow use of their satellite imagery for making maps. In 2012, the launch of pricing for Google Maps led several prominent websites to switch from their service to OpenStreetMap and other competitors. Chief among these were Foursquare and Craigslist, which adopted OpenStreetMap, and Apple, which ended a contract with Google and launched a self-built mapping platform using TomTom and OpenStreetMap data. Map production Editing with JOSM after a ground survey Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. Mapathon competition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non- profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area. The availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems. =Software for editing maps= StreetComplete asking user a question, with answer filled in. After tapping \\"OK\\" this answer will be added to an OpenStreetMap database. Editing of maps can be done using the default web browser editor called iD, an HTML5 application using D3.js and written by Mapbox, which was originally financed by the Knight Foundation. The earlier Flash-based application Potlatch is retained for intermediate-level users. JOSM and Merkaartor are more powerful desktop editing applications that are better suited for advanced users. Vespucci is the first full-featured editor for Android; it was released in 2009. StreetComplete is an Android app launched in 2016, which allows users without any OpenStreetMap knowledge to answer simple quests for existing data in OpenStreetMap, and thus contribute data. Maps.me and OsmAnd, two offline map mobile applications available for Android and iOS, both include limited OSM data editors. Go Map!! is an iOS app that lets users create and edit information in OpenStreetMap. Pushpin is another iOS app that lets users add POI on the go. =Contributors= Field survey in various parts of the Guagua by a group of mappers. They took notes and photos, and recorded GPS tracks. Shown in the photo is the Betis group standing beside one of the Death March trail monuments. The project has a geographically diverse user-base, due to emphasis of local knowledge and ground truth in the process of data collection. Many early contributors were cyclists who survey with and for bicyclists, charting cycleroutes and navigable trails. Others are GIS professionals who contribute data with Esri tools. Contributors are predominately men, with only 3‚Äì5% being women.\\"Gender and Experience-Related Motivators for Contributing to OpenStreetMap\\". https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_218905.pdf By August 2008, shortly after the second The State of the Map conference was held, there were over 50,000 registered contributors; by March 2009, there were 100,000 and by the end of 2009 the figure was nearly 200,000. In April 2012, OpenStreetMap cleared 600,000 registered contributors. On 6 January 2013, OpenStreetMap reached one million registered users. Around 30% of users have contributed at least one point to the OpenStreetMap database. There are approximately 6,500 contributors active on any given day, although this number continues to rise quite rapidly as OSM gains popularity. =Surveys and personal knowledge= Surveying routes with a GPS receiver Ground surveys are performed by a mapper, on foot, bicycle, or in a car, motorcycle, or boat. Map data was typically recorded on a GPS unit until late 2006 when Yahoo! made their aerial imagery available for tracing to OSM contributors, rendering this tedious method obsolete. The project still makes use of public GPS traces which are used to align aerial imagery Once the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit. Some committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map. = Street-level image data = In addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: Bing Streetside 360¬∞ image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced Mapillary and OpenStreetCam platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images. =Government data= Some government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under public domain.See Copyright status of work by the U.S. government for more details. Globally, OSM initially used the Prototype Global Shoreline from NOAA. Due to it being oversimplified and crude, it has been mainly replaced by other government sources or manual tracing. In the United States, most roads originate from TIGER from the Census Bureau. Geographic names were initially sourced from Geographic Names Information System, and some areas contain water features from the National Hydrography Dataset. In the UK, some Ordnance Survey OpenData is imported. In Canada Natural Resources Canada's CanVec vector data and GeoBase provide landcover and streets. Out-of-copyright maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK Crown copyright expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1 inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors. =Route planning= In February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely OSRM, GraphHopper and MapQuest. There are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.

OpenStreetMap maintains lists of online and offline routing engines available, such as the Open Source Routing Machine. OSM data is popular with routing researchers, and is also available to open- source projects and companies to build routing applications (or for any other purpose). =Humanitarian aid= OpenStreetMap Philippines GPS map, an end- product of over a thousand crisis mappers that contributed almost 5 million map updates during the 2013 Haiyan humanitarian activation. The 2010 Haiti earthquake has established a model for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to collaborate with international organisations. OpenStreetMap and Crisis Commons volunteers using available satellite imagery to map the roads, buildings and refugee camps of Port-au-Prince in just two days, building \\"the most complete digital map of Haiti's roads\\". The resulting data and maps have been used by several organisations providing relief aid, such as the World Bank, the European Commission Joint Research Centre, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOSAT and others. NGOs, like the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and others, have worked with donors like United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to map other parts of Haiti and parts of many other countries, both to create map data for places that were blank, and to engage and build capacity of local people. After Haiti, the OpenStreetMap community continued mapping to support humanitarian organisations for various crises and disasters. After the Northern Mali conflict (January 2013), Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (November 2013), and the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa (March 2014), the OpenStreetMap community has shown it can play a significant role in supporting humanitarian organisations. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team acts as an interface between the OpenStreetMap community and the humanitarian organisations. Along with post-disaster work, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has worked to build better risk models and grow the local OpenStreetMap communities in multiple countries including Uganda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo in partnership with the Red Cross, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, World Bank, and other humanitarian groups. =Scientific research= OpenStreetMap data was used in scientific studies. For example, road data was used for research of remaining roadless areas.Ibisch, Pierre & Hoffmann, Monika & Kreft, Stefan & Pe'er, Guy & Kati, Vassiliki & Biber-Freudenberger, Lisa & Dellasala, Dominick & Vale, Mariana & Hobson, Peter & Selva, Nuria. (2016). A global map of roadless areas and their conservation status.

Venues have been:    *2019: Heidelberg, Germany * (July 4‚Äì5). (The event was originally planned to take place in Cape Town, South Africa, has been turned into an online conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic) There are also various national, regional and continental SotM conferences, such as State of the Map U.S., SotM Baltics and SotM Asia. Legal aspects =Licensing terms= OpenStreetMap data was originally published under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence (CC BY-SA) with the intention of promoting free use and redistribution of the data. In September 2012, the licence was changed to the Open Database Licence (ODbL) published by Open Data Commons (ODC) in order to more specifically define its bearing on data rather than representation. As part of this relicensing process, some of the map data was removed from the public distribution. This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object. Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change. All data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a set of terms which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible. Software used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by Ruby on Rails. The application also uses PostgreSQL for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by Mapnik, stored in PostGIS, and powered by an Apache module called mod_tile. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor Potlatch2, have been made available as public domain. =Commercial data contributions= Some OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features. Notably, Automotive Navigation Data provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, Yahoo! confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a free and open licence, until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011. In November 2010, Microsoft announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors. For a period from 2009 to 2011, NearMap Pty Ltd made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a CC BY-SA licence. In June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project ‚Äì four times the number contributed by users and government data imports. Operation While OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance. =Data format= OpenStreetMap uses a topological data structure, with four core elements (also known as data primitives): * Nodes are points with a geographic position, stored as coordinates (pairs of a latitude and a longitude) according to WGS 84.WGS 84 OpenStreetMap Wiki Outside of their usage in ways, they are used to represent map features without a size, such as points of interest or mountain peaks. * Ways are ordered lists of nodes, representing a polyline, or possibly a polygon if they form a closed loop. They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes. * Relations are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called \\"members\\"), where each member can optionally have a \\"role\\" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes. * Tags are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store metadata about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended ontology of map features (the meaning of tags) is maintained on a wiki. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a popular vote of a written proposal in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017. =Data storage= The OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats. The main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows. All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it. For data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called planet.osm. These dumps exist in two formats, one using XML and one using the Protocol Buffer Binary Format (PBF). = Popular services = Moovit Navigate A variety of popular services incorporate some sort of geolocation or map- based component. Notable services using OSM for this include: * Apple Inc. unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for iPhoto for iOS on , and launched the maps without properly citing the data source ‚Äì though this was corrected in 1.0.1. OpenStreetMap is one of the many cited sources for Apple's custom maps in iOS 6, though the majority of map data is provided by TomTom. * Craigslist switched to OpenStreetMap in 2012, rendering their own tiles based on the data. * Ballardia (games developer) launched World of the Living Dead: Resurrection in October 2013, which has incorporated OpenStreetMap into its game engine, along with census information to create a browser-based game mapping over 14,000 square kilometres of greater Los Angeles and survival strategy gameplay. Its previous incarnation had used Google Maps, which had proven incapable of supporting high volumes of players, so during 2013 they shut down the Google Maps version and ported the game to OSM. * Facebook uses the map directly in its website/mobile app (depending on the zoom level, the area and the device). * Flickr uses OpenStreetMap data for various cities around the world, including Baghdad, Beijing, Kabul, Santiago, Sydney and Tokyo. In 2012, the maps switched to use Nokia data primarily, with OSM being used in areas where the commercial provider lacked performance. * Foursquare started using OpenStreetMap via Mapbox's rendering and infrastructure of OSM. * Geotab uses OpenStreetMap data in their Vehicle Tracking Software platform, MyGeotab. * Hasbro, the toy company behind the real estate-themed board game Monopoly, launched Monopoly City Streets, a massively multiplayer online game (MMORPG) which allowed players to \\"buy\\" streets all over the world. The game used map tiles from Google Maps and the Google Maps API to display the game board, but the underlying street data was obtained from OpenStreetMap. The online game was a limited time offering, its servers were shut down in the end of January 2010. * Mapbox * MapQuest announced a service based on OpenStreetMap in 2010, which eventually became MapQuest Open. * Moovit uses maps based on OpenStreetMap in their free mobile application for public transit navigation. * Niantic switched to OSM based maps from Google Maps on 1 December 2017 for their games Ingress and Pok√©mon Go. * Nominatim (from the Latin, 'by name') is a tool to search OSM data by name and address (geocoding) and then to generate synthetic addresses of OSM points (reverse geocoding). * OpenGeofiction is a geofiction website that uses the OpenStreetMap software but instead of the Earth, it has the map of a fictional planet. When signing up, users can only edit certain countries specifically marked as available for everyone. After at least seven days (pending approval from staff), the user can apply for a country (or sometimes part of a country) to edit. Users are expected to keep their parts of the map realistic (ie, earthlike, set in the present day and no Science fiction or fantasy elements) and not copy anything from OpenStreetMap (as that would be copyright infringement). They also have a wiki but officially, the staff prefers that users concentrate on the map and use the wiki to describe things on the map (and certain things impossible to put on the map like national flags) and for collaboration. The site also has a \\"user diary\\" section which is basically a shared blog. * Snapchat's June 2017 update introduced its Snap Map with data from Mapbox, OpenStreetMap, and DigitalGlobe. * Strava switched to OpenStreetMap rendered and hosted by Mapbox from Google Maps in July 2015. * Tableau has integrated OSM for all their mapping needs. It has been integrated in all of their products. * TCDD Ta≈üƒ±macƒ±lƒ±k uses OpenStreetMap as a location map on passenger seats on YHTs. * Tesla Smart Summon feature released widely in US in October 2019 uses OSM data to navigate vehicles in private parking areas autonomously (without a safety driver) * Webots uses OpenStreetMap data to create virtual environment for autonomous vehicle simulations. * Wikimedia projects uses OpenStreetMap as a locator map for cities and travel points of interest. * Wikipedia uses OpenStreetMap data to render custom maps used by the articles. Many languages are included in the WIWOSM project (Wikipedia Where in OSM) which aims to show OSM objects on a slippy map, directly visible on the article page.

He was a financial analyst and political strategist in the 1960 United States presidential campaign of his brother-in-law John F. Kennedy. Early life Smith was born in Bayport, Long Island, New York, and grew up in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. He attended Georgetown University, graduating in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in history. He served during the Korean War as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force from 1951‚Äì1952. Career Smith joined his family's business, Cleary Brothers Inc., which operated tugs and barges on New York's upstate canals and in New York Harbor. He then headed the Park Agency Inc., in Manhattan, where he managed $300 million in Kennedy family investments. After his father-in-law Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. suffered a stroke on December 19, 1961, Smith managed the family's fortune out of a New York City office building. He was responsible for overseeing the trusts that benefited him and his family as well as the other children and grandchildren of Joe and Rose Kennedy. =Kennedy campaigns= Smith played an active role in JFK's 1960 presidential campaign, and was working as Kennedy's campaign manager for re-election in 1964 at the time when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Smith served as United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy's campaign manager during his 1968 presidential run at the time when the Senator was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California on June 5, 1968. In the fall of 1979, as polls showed that Senator Ted Kennedy could easily defeat President Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primaries, Kennedy announced his candidacy and made Smith his campaign manager. Kennedy lost to Carter and chose to not run again. Personal life Smith and Jean Ann Kennedy were married May 19, 1956, at which point he became the brother-in-law of future President John F. Kennedy.

The complex now houses the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. History Victoria Terrasse in Oslo Victoria Terrasse was built between 1884 and 1890 as an apartment complex. It was designed by architect Henrik Thrap-Meyer, assisted by Wilhelm von Hanno, Paul Due and Richard Steckmest. It consisted of three quarters and provided a fashionable residential complex. The complex's features included rich profiling and a wide variety of wrought iron detail. The building complex utilized electric power and had the largest apartments along the main facade. The facades are articulated with relatively deeply profiled horizontal bands that mark the two main floors. The exterior is made of polished tiled brick painted white, enhanced by decorative towers, domes and cupolas. From 1891 to 1895, Henrik Ibsen lived on the first floor of the southern quarter. It was taken over by the Norwegian government in 1913 and put to use by the police and various political departments. Infamously, it was taken over by the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst in April 1940, serving as headquarters during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. The offices held the interrogation centre for all prisoners in Oslo, and the place became synonymous with torture and abuse. On occasion prisoners jumped out of windows to their death while waiting to be interrogated. Allied bombers tried to destroy Victoria Terrasse on 25 September 1942 and 31 December 1944 but missed the complex and instead hit civilian targets.

Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. The terms child abuse and child maltreatment are often used interchangeably, although some researchers make a distinction between them, treating child maltreatment as an umbrella term to cover neglect, exploitation, and trafficking. Different jurisdictions have developed their own stance towards mandatory reporting, different definitions of what constitutes child abuse for the purposes of removing children from their families or for prosecuting a criminal charge. History Two centuries ago, cruelty to children, perpetrated by employers and teachers, was widespread, and corporal punishment customary in many countries. But, in the first half of the 19th century, pathologists studying filicide (the parental killing of children) reported cases of death from paternal rage,Editorial (1848) Triple infanticide ‚Äì suicide du meurtrier.

Annales d'Hygi√®ne Publique et de M√©decine L√©gale 29: 185-203. In 1860, a key paper gathered together a series of 32 such cases, of which 18 were fatal, the children dying from starvation and/or recurrent physical abuse; it included the case of Adeline Defert, who was returned by her grandparents at the age of 8, and for 9 years tortured by her parents ‚Äì whipped every day, hung up by her thumbs and beaten with a nailed plank, burnt with hot coals and her wounds bathed in nitric acid, and deflorated with a baton.Tardieu A (1860) √âtude m√©dico-l√©gale sur les s√©vices et mauvais traitements exerc√©s sur des enfants. Annales d‚ÄôHygi√®ne 15: 361-398. Tardieu made home visits and observed the effect on the children; he noticed that the sadness and fear on their faces disappeared when they were placed under protection. He commented, ‚ÄúWhen we consider the tender age of these poor defenceless beings, subjected daily and almost hourly to savage atrocities, unimaginable tortures and harsh privation, their lives one long martyrdom ‚Äì and when we face the fact that their tormentors are the very mothers who gave them life, we are confronted with one of the most appalling problems that can disturb the soul of a moralist, or the conscience of justice‚Äù.

Journal of the American Medical Association 158: 539-543. As a result, professional inquiry into the topic began again in the 1960s. The July 1962 publication of the paper \\"The Battered Child-Syndrome\\" authored principally to pediatric psychiatrist C. Henry Kempe and published in The Journal of the American Medical Association represents the moment that child maltreatment entered mainstream awareness. Before the article's publication, injuries to children‚Äîeven repeated bone fractures‚Äîwere not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed bone diseases or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies. The study of child abuse emerged as an academic discipline in the early 1970s in the United States. Elisabeth Young-Bruehl maintains that despite the growing numbers of child advocates and interest in protecting children which took place, the grouping of children into \\"the abused\\" and the \\"non-abused\\" created an artificial distinction that narrowed the concept of children's rights to simply protection from maltreatment, and blocked investigation of the ways in which children are discriminated against in society generally. Another effect of the way child abuse and neglect have been studied, according to Young-Bruehl, was to close off consideration of how children themselves perceive maltreatment and the importance they place on adults' attitudes toward them. Young-Bruehl writes that when the belief in children's inherent inferiority to adults is present in society, all children suffer whether or not their treatment is labeled as \\"abuse\\".  Definitions  Definitions of what constitutes child abuse vary among professionals, between social and cultural groups, and across time. The terms abuse and maltreatment are often used interchangeably in the literature. Child maltreatment can also be an umbrella term covering all forms of child abuse and child neglect. Defining child maltreatment depends on prevailing cultural values as they relate to children, child development, and parenting. Definitions of child maltreatment can vary across the sectors of society which deal with the issue, such as child protection agencies, legal and medical communities, public health officials, researchers, practitioners, and child advocates. Since members of these various fields tend to use their own definitions, communication across disciplines can be limited, hampering efforts to identify, assess, track, treat, and prevent child maltreatment. In general, abuse refers to (usually deliberate) acts of commission while neglect refers to acts of omission. Child maltreatment includes both acts of commission and acts of omission on the part of parents or caregivers that cause actual or threatened harm to a child. Some health professionals and authors consider neglect as part of the definition of abuse, while others do not; this is because the harm may have been unintentional, or because the caregivers did not understand the severity of the problem, which may have been the result of cultural beliefs about how to raise a child. Delayed effects of child abuse and neglect, especially emotional neglect, and the diversity of acts that qualify as child abuse, are also factors. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child abuse and child maltreatment as \\"all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power.\\" In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses the term child maltreatment to refer to both acts of commission (abuse), which include \\"words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to a child\\", and acts of omission (neglect), meaning \\"the failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm\\". The United States federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act defines child abuse and neglect as, at minimum, \\"any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation\\" or \\"an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm\\". Types As of 2006, the World Health Organization distinguishes four types of child maltreatment: physical abuse; sexual abuse; emotional (or psychological) abuse; and neglect. =Physical abuse= Among professionals and the general public, there is disagreement as to what behaviors constitute physical abuse of a child.Noh Anh, Helen (1994). \\"Cultural Diversity and the Definition of Child Abuse\\", in Barth, R.P. et al., Child Welfare Research Review, Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 28. Physical abuse often does not occur in isolation, but as part of a constellation of behaviors including authoritarian control, anxiety-provoking behavior, and a lack of parental warmth. The WHO defines physical abuse as: Overlapping definitions of physical abuse and physical punishment of children highlight a subtle or non-existent distinction between abuse and punishment, but most physical abuse is physical punishment \\"in intent, form, and effect\\". As of 2006, for instance, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro wrote in the UN Secretary- General's Study on Violence Against Children: Most nations with child abuse laws deem the deliberate infliction of serious injuries, or actions that place the child at obvious risk of serious injury or death, to be illegal. Bruises, scratches, burns, broken bones, lacerations ‚Äî as well as repeated \\"mishaps,\\" and rough treatment that could cause physical injuries ‚Äî can be physical abuse. Multiple injuries or fractures at different stages of healing can raise suspicion of abuse. The psychologist Alice Miller, noted for her books on child abuse, took the view that humiliations, spankings and beatings, slaps in the face, etc. are all forms of abuse, because they injure the integrity and dignity of a child, even if their consequences are not visible right away. Physical abuse as a child can lead to physical and mental difficulties in the future, including re-victimization, personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, substance abuse, and aggression. Physical abuse in childhood has also been linked to homelessness in adulthood. =Sexual abuse= Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation. Sexual abuse refers to the participation of a child in a sexual act aimed toward the physical gratification or the financial profit of the person committing the act. Forms of CSA include asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities (regardless of the outcome), indecent exposure of the genitals to a child, displaying pornography to a child, actual sexual contact with a child, physical contact with the child's genitals, viewing of the child's genitalia without physical contact, or using a child to produce child pornography. Selling the sexual services of children may be viewed and treated as child abuse rather than simple incarceration. Effects of child sexual abuse on the victim(s) include guilt and self-blame, flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia, fear of things associated with the abuse (including objects, smells, places, doctor's visits, etc.), self-esteem difficulties, sexual dysfunction, chronic pain, addiction, self-injury, suicidal ideation, somatic complaints, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, other mental illnesses including borderline personality disorder and dissociative identity disorder, propensity to re-victimization in adulthood, bulimia nervosa, and physical injury to the child, among other problems. Children who are the victims are also at an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections due to their immature immune systems and a high potential for mucosal tears during forced sexual contact. Sexual victimization at a young age has been correlated with several risk factors for contracting HIV including decreased knowledge of sexual topics, increased prevalence of HIV, engagement in risky sexual practices, condom avoidance, lower knowledge of safe sex practices, frequent changing of sexual partners, and more years of sexual activity. As of 2016, in the United States, about 15% to 25% of women and 5% to 15% of men were sexually abused when they were children. Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims; approximately 30% are relatives of the child, most often brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, uncles or cousins; around 60% are other acquaintances such as friends of the family, babysitters, or neighbours; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases. In over one-third of cases, the perpetrator is also a minor. In 1999 the BBC reported on the RAHI Foundation's survey of sexual abuse in India, in which 76% of respondents said they had been abused as children, 40% of those stating the perpetrator was a family member. United States federal prosecutors registered multiple charges against a South Korean man for reportedly running the world's \\"largest dark web child porn marketplace.\\" Reportedly, the English translated website \\"Welcome to Video\\", which has now been taken consisted of more than 200,000 videos or 8TB of data showing sexual acts involving infants, children and toddlers and processed about 7,300 Bitcoin, i.e. $730,000 worth of transactions. =Psychological abuse= There are multiple definitions of child psychological abuse: * In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) added Child Psychological Abuse to the DSM-5, describing it as \\"nonaccidental verbal or symbolic acts by a child's parent or caregiver that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in significant psychological harm to the child.\\" * In 1995, APSAC defined it as: spurning, terrorizing, isolating, exploiting, corrupting, denying emotional responsiveness, or neglect\\" or \\"A repeated pattern of caregiver behavior or extreme incident(s) that convey to children that they are worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs\\" * In the United States, states laws vary, but most have laws against \\"mental injury\\" * Some have defined it as the production of psychological and social defects in the growth of a child as a result of behavior such as loud yelling, coarse and rude attitude, inattention, harsh criticism, and denigration of the child's personality. Other examples include name-calling, ridicule, degradation, destruction of personal belongings, torture or killing of a pet, excessive criticism, inappropriate or excessive demands, withholding communication, and routine labeling or humiliation. In 2014, the APA stated that: * \\"Childhood psychological abuse [is] as harmful as sexual or physical abuse.\\" * \\"Nearly 3 million U.S. children experience some form of [psychological] maltreatment annually.\\" * Psychological maltreatment is \\"the most challenging and prevalent form of child abuse and neglect.\\" * \\"Given the prevalence of childhood psychological abuse and the severity of harm to young victims, it should be at the forefront of mental health and social service training\\" In 2015, additional research confirmed these 2014 statements of the APA. Victims of emotional abuse may react by distancing themselves from the abuser, internalizing the abusive words, or fighting back by insulting the abuser. Emotional abuse can result in abnormal or disrupted attachment development, a tendency for victims to blame themselves (self-blame) for the abuse, learned helplessness, and overly passive behavior. =Neglect= Child neglect is the failure of a parent or other person with responsibility for the child, to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child's health, safety or well-being may be threatened with harm. Neglect is also a lack of attention from the people surrounding a child, and the non-provision of the relevant and adequate necessities for the child's survival, which would be a lack of attention, love, and nurturing. Some observable signs of child neglect include: the child is frequently absent from school, begs or steals food or money, lacks needed medical and dental care, is consistently dirty, or lacks appropriate clothing for the weather. The 2010 Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS), a yearly United States federal government report based on data supplied by state Child Protective Services (CPS) Agencies in the U.S., found that neglect/neglectful behavior was the \\"most common form of child maltreatment \\". Neglectful acts can be divided into six sub-categories: *Supervisory neglect: characterized by the absence of a parent or guardian which can lead to physical harm, sexual abuse, or criminal behavior; *Physical neglect: characterized by the failure to provide the basic physical necessities, such as a safe and clean home; *Medical neglect: characterized by the lack of providing medical care; *Emotional neglect: characterized by a lack of nurturance, encouragement, and support; *Educational neglect: characterized by the caregivers lack to provide an education and additional resources to actively participate in the school system; and *Abandonment: when the parent or guardian leaves a child alone for a long period of time without a babysitter or caretaker. Neglected children may experience delays in physical and psychosocial development, possibly resulting in psychopathology and impaired neuropsychological functions including executive function, attention, processing speed, language, memory and social skills. Researchers investigating maltreated children have repeatedly found that neglected children in the foster and adoptive populations manifest different emotional and behavioral reactions to regain lost or secure relationships and are frequently reported to have disorganized attachments and a need to control their environment. Such children are not likely to view caregivers as being a source of safety, and instead typically show an increase in aggressive and hyperactive behaviors which may disrupt healthy or secure attachment with their adopted parents. These children seem to have learned to adapt to an abusive and inconsistent caregiver by becoming cautiously self-reliant, and are often described as glib, manipulative and disingenuous in their interactions with others as they move through childhood. Children who are victims of neglect can have a more difficult time forming and maintaining relationships, such as romantic or friendship, later in life due to the lack of attachment they had in their earlier stages of life. Effects Child abuse can result in immediate adverse physical effects but it is also strongly associated with developmental problems and with many chronic physical and psychological effects, including subsequent ill-health, including higher rates of chronic conditions, high-risk health behaviors and shortened lifespan. Maltreated children may grow up to be maltreating adults. A 1991 source reported that studies indicate that 90 percent of maltreating adults were maltreated as children.Starr RH, Wolfe DA (1991). The Effects of Child Abuse and Neglect (pp. 1‚Äì33). New York: The Guilford Press. Almost 7 million American infants receive child care services, such as day care, and much of that care is poor. =Emotional= Child abuse can cause a range of emotional effects. Children who are constantly ignored, shamed, terrorized or humiliated suffer at least as much, if not more, than if they are physically assaulted. According to the Joyful Heart Foundation, brain development of the child is greatly influenced and responds to the experiences with families, caregivers, and the community. Abused children can grow up experiencing insecurities, low self-esteem, and lack of development. Many abused children experience ongoing difficulties with trust, social withdrawal, trouble in school, and forming relationships. Babies and other young children can be affected differently by abuse than their older counterparts. Babies and pre- school children who are being emotionally abused or neglected may be overly affectionate towards strangers or people they haven't known for very long. They can lack confidence or become anxious, appear to not have a close relationship with their parent, exhibit aggressive behavior or act nasty towards other children and animals. Older children may use foul language or act in a markedly different way to other children at the same age, struggle to control strong emotions, seem isolated from their parents, lack social skills or have few, if any, friends. Children can also experience reactive attachment disorder (RAD). RAD is defined as markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness, that usually begins before the age of 5 years. RAD can present as a persistent failure to start or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social situations. The long-term impact of emotional abuse has not been studied widely, but recent studies have begun to document its long-term consequences. Emotional abuse has been linked to increased depression, anxiety, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships (Spertus, Wong, Halligan, & Seremetis, 2003). Victims of child abuse and neglect are more likely to commit crimes as juveniles and adults. Domestic violence also takes its toll on children; although the child is not the one being abused, the child witnessing the domestic violence is greatly influential as well. Research studies conducted such as the \\"Longitudinal Study on the Effects of Child Abuse and Children's Exposure to Domestic Violence\\", show that 36.8% of children engage in felony assault compared to the 47.5% of abused/assaulted children. Research has shown that children exposed to domestic violence increases the chances of experienced behavioral and emotional problems (depression, irritability, anxiety, academic problems, and problems in language development). Overall, emotional effects caused by child abuse and even witnessing abuse can result in long-term and short-term effects that ultimately affect a child's upbringing and development. =Physical= Rib fractures in an infant secondary to child abuse The immediate physical effects of abuse or neglect can be relatively minor (bruises or cuts) or severe (broken bones, hemorrhage, or even death). In some cases the physical effects are temporary; however, the pain and suffering they cause a child should not be discounted. Rib fractures may be seen with physical abuse, and if present may increase suspicion of abuse, but are found in a small minority of children with maltreatment-related injuries. The long- term impact of child abuse and neglect on physical health and development can be: * Shaken baby syndrome. Shaking a baby is a common form of child abuse that often results in permanent neurological damage (80% of cases) or death (30% of cases). Damage results from intracranial hypertension (increased pressure in the skull) after bleeding in the brain, damage to the spinal cord and neck, and rib or bone fractures. * Impaired brain development. Child abuse and neglect have been shown, in some cases, to cause important regions of the brain to fail to form or grow properly, resulting in impaired development. Structural brain changes as a result of child abuse or neglect include overall smaller brain volume, hippocampal atrophy, prefrontal cortex dysfunction, decreased corpus callosum density, and delays in the myelination of synapses. These alterations in brain maturation have long-term consequences for cognitive, language, and academic abilities.Tiffany Watts-English T, Fortson BL, Gibler N, Hooper SR, De Bellis MD Journal of Social Issues 2006 Volume 62, Issue 4, pages 717‚Äì736 doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2006.00484.x In addition, these neurological changes impact the amygdala and hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis which are involved in stress response and may cause post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. * Poor physical health. In addition to possible immediate adverse physical effects, household dysfunction and childhood maltreatment are strongly associated with many chronic physical and psychological effects, including subsequent ill-health in childhood, adolescence and adulthood, with higher rates of chronic conditions, high-risk health behaviors and shortened lifespan. Adults who experienced abuse or neglect during childhood are more likely to suffer from physical ailments such as allergies, arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, high blood pressure, and ulcers.Long-Term Consequences of Child Abuse and Neglect. Child Welfare Information Gateway, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2013. Factsheet There may be a higher risk of developing cancer later in life, as well as possible immune dysfunction. * Exposure to violence during childhood is associated with shortened telomeres and with reduced telomerase activity. The increased rate of telomere length reduction correlates to a reduction in lifespan of 7 to 15 years. * Data from a recent study supports previous findings that specific neurobiochemical changes are linked to exposure to violence and abuse, several biological pathways can possibly lead to the development of illness, and certain physiological mechanisms can moderate how severe illnesses become in patients with past experience with violence or abuse. * Recent studies give evidence of a link between stress occurring early in life and epigenetic modifications that last into adulthood.  Adverse Childhood Experiences Study  Possible ways for adverse childhood experiences such as abuse and neglect to influence health and well-being throughout the lifespan, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is a long-running investigation into the relationship between childhood adversity, including various forms of abuse and neglect, and health problems in later life. The initial phase of the study was conducted in San Diego, California from 1995 to 1997. The World Health Organization summarizes the study as: \\"childhood maltreatment and household dysfunction contribute to the development ‚Äì decades later ‚Äì of the chronic diseases that are the most common causes of death and disability in the United States... A strong relationship was seen between the number of adverse experiences (including physical and sexual abuse in childhood) and self-reports of cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, attempted suicide, sexual promiscuity and sexually transmitted diseases in later life.\\" A long-term study of adults retrospectively reporting adverse childhood experiences including verbal, physical and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of childhood trauma found 25.9% of adults reported verbal abuse as children, 14.8% reported physical abuse, and 12.2% reported sexual abuse. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System corroborate these high rates. There is a high correlation between the number of different adverse childhood experiences (A.C.E.s) and risk for poor health outcomes in adults including cancer, heart attack, mental illness, reduced longevity drug and alcohol abuse. An anonymous self-reporting survey of Washington State students finds 6‚Äì7% of 8th, 10th and 12th grade students actually attempt suicide. Rates of depression are twice as high. Other risk behaviors are even higher. There is a relationship between child physical and sexual abuse and suicide. For legal and cultural reasons as well as fears by children of being taken away from their parents most childhood abuse goes unreported and unsubstantiated. It has been discovered that childhood abuse can lead to the addiction of drugs and alcohol in adolescence and adult life. Studies show that any type of abuse experienced in childhood can cause neurological changes making an individual more prone to addictive tendencies. A significant study examined 900 court cases of children who had experienced sexual and physical abuse along with neglect. The study found that a large sum of the children who were abused are now currently addicted to alcohol. This case study outlines how addiction is a significant effect of childhood abuse. = Psychological = Children who have a history of neglect or physical abuse are at risk of developing psychiatric problems, or a disorganized attachment style. In addition, children who experience child abuse or neglect are 59% more likely to be arrested as juveniles, 28% more likely to be arrested as adults, and 30% more likely to commit violent crime. Disorganized attachment is associated with a number of developmental problems, including dissociative symptoms, as well as anxiety, depressive, and acting out symptoms. A study by Dante Cicchetti found that 80% of abused and maltreated infants exhibited symptoms of disorganized attachment. When some of these children become parents, especially if they suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociative symptoms, and other sequelae of child abuse, they may encounter difficulty when faced with their infant and young children's needs and normative distress, which may in turn lead to adverse consequences for their child's social-emotional development. Additionally, children may find it difficult to feel empathy towards themselves or others, which may cause them to feel alone and unable to make friends. Despite these potential difficulties, psychosocial intervention can be effective, at least in some cases, in changing the ways maltreated parents think about their young children. Victims of childhood abuse also suffer from different types of physical health problems later in life. Some reportedly suffer from some type of chronic head, abdominal, pelvic, or muscular pain with no identifiable reason.Takele Hamnasu, MBA. Impact of Childhood Abuse on Adult Health. Amberton University. Even though the majority of childhood abuse victims know or believe that their abuse is, or can be, the cause of different health problems in their adult life, for the great majority their abuse was not directly associated with those problems, indicating that sufferers were most likely diagnosed with other possible causes for their health problems, instead of their childhood abuse. One long-term study found that up to 80% of abused people had at least one psychiatric disorder at age 21, with problems including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and suicide attempts. One Canadian hospital found that between 36% and 76% of women mental health outpatients had been sexually abused, as had 58% of women and 23% of men schizophrenic inpatients. A recent study has discovered that a crucial structure in the brain's reward circuits is compromised by childhood abuse and neglect, and predicts Depressive Symptoms later in life. In the case of 23 of the 27 illnesses listed in the questionnaire of a French INSEE survey, some statistically significant correlations were found between repeated illness and family traumas encountered by the child before the age of 18 years. According to Georges Menahem, the French sociologist who found out these correlations by studying health inequalities, these relationships show that inequalities in illness and suffering are not only social. Health inequality also has its origins in the family, where it is associated with the degrees of lasting affective problems (lack of affection, parental discord, the prolonged absence of a parent, or a serious illness affecting either the mother or father) that individuals report having experienced in childhood.\\"Study of Living Conditions 1986‚Äì1987\\" INSEE survey with a sample of 13‚Äì154 individuals, cf. Menahem G., \\"Probl√®mes de l'enfance, statut social et sant√© des adultes\\", IRDES, biblio No 1010, pp. 59‚Äì63, Paris. Many children who have been abused in any form develop some sort of psychological problem. These problems may include: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, OCD, co-dependency, or even a lack of human connections. There is also a slight tendency for children who have been abused to become child abusers themselves. In the U.S. in 2013, of the 294,000 reported child abuse cases only 81,124 received any sort of counseling or therapy. Treatment is greatly important for abused children. On the other hand, there are some children who are raised in child abuse, but who manage to do unexpectedly well later in life regarding the preconditions. Such children have been termed ', as inspired from the way that dandelions seem to prosper irrespective of soil, sun, drought, or rain. Such children (or currently grown-ups) are of high interest in finding factors that mitigate the effects of child abuse. Causes Child abuse is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes. No single factor can be identified as to why some adults behave abusively or neglectfully toward children. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) identify multiple factors at the level of the individual, their relationships, their local community, and their society at large, that combine to influence the occurrence of child maltreatment. At the individual level, such factors include age, sex, and personal history, while at the level of society, factors contributing to child maltreatment include cultural norms encouraging harsh physical punishment of children, economic inequality, and the lack of social safety nets. WHO and ISPCAN state that understanding the complex interplay of various risk factors is vital for dealing with the problem of child maltreatment. The American psychoanalyst Elisabeth Young- Bruehl maintains that harm to children is justified and made acceptable by widely held beliefs in children's inherent subservience to adults, resulting in a largely unacknowledged prejudice against children she terms childism. She contends that such prejudice, while not the immediate cause of child maltreatment, must be investigated in order to understand the motivations behind a given act of abuse, as well as to shed light on societal failures to support children's needs and development in general. Founding editor of the International Journal of Children's Rights, Michael Freeman, also argues that the ultimate causes of child abuse lie in prejudice against children, especially the view that human rights do not apply equally to adults and children. He writes, \\"the roots of child abuse lie not in parental psycho- pathology or in socio-environmental stress (though their influences cannot be discounted) but in a sick culture which denigrates and depersonalizes, which reduces children to property, to sexual objects so that they become the legitimate victims of both adult violence and lust\\". A girl who was burned during religious violence in Orissa, India. Parents who physically abuse their spouses are more likely than others to physically abuse their children. However, it is impossible to know whether marital strife is a cause of child abuse, or if both the marital strife and the abuse are caused by tendencies in the abuser. Sometimes, parents set expectations for their child that are clearly beyond the child's capability. When parents' expectations are far beyond what is appropriate to the child (e.g., preschool children who are expected to be totally responsible for self-care or provision of nurturance to parents) the resulting frustration caused by the child's non-compliance is believed to function as a contributory if not necessary cause of child abuse. Most acts of physical violence against children are undertaken with the intent to punish. In the United States, interviews with parents reveal that as many as two thirds of documented instances of physical abuse begin as acts of corporal punishment meant to correct a child's behavior, while a large-scale Canadian study found that three quarters of substantiated cases of physical abuse of children have occurred within the context of physical punishment. Other studies have shown that children and infants who are spanked by parents are several times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents or suffer an injury requiring medical attention. Studies indicate that such abusive treatment often involves parents attributing conflict to their child's willfulness or rejection, as well as \\"coercive family dynamics and conditioned emotional responses\\". Factors involved in the escalation of ordinary physical punishment by parents into confirmed child abuse may be the punishing parent's inability to control their anger or judge their own strength, and the parent being unaware of the child's physical vulnerabilities.\\"Corporal Punishment\\" International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 2008. Some professionals argue that cultural norms that sanction physical punishment are one of the causes of child abuse, and have undertaken campaigns to redefine such norms. Children resulting from unintended pregnancies are more likely to be abused or neglected. In addition, unintended pregnancies are more likely than intended pregnancies to be associated with abusive relationships, and there is an increased risk of physical violence during pregnancy. They also result in poorer maternal mental health, and lower mother-child relationship quality. There is some limited evidence that children with moderate or severe disabilities are more likely to be victims of abuse than non-disabled children. A study on child abuse sought to determine: the forms of child abuse perpetrated on children with disabilities; the extent of child abuse; and the causes of child abuse of children with disabilities. A questionnaire on child abuse was adapted and used to collect data in this study. Participants comprised a sample of 31 pupils with disabilities (15 children with vision impairment and 16 children with hearing impairment) selected from special schools in Botswana. The study found that the majority of participants were involved in doing domestic chores. They were also sexually, physically and emotionally abused by their teachers. This study showed that children with disabilities were vulnerable to child abuse in their schools. Substance abuse can be a major contributing factor to child abuse. One U.S. study found that parents with documented substance abuse, most commonly alcohol, cocaine, and heroin, were much more likely to mistreat their children, and were also much more likely to reject court-ordered services and treatments. Another study found that over two-thirds of cases of child maltreatment involved parents with substance abuse problems. This study specifically found relationships between alcohol and physical abuse, and between cocaine and sexual abuse. Also parental stress caused by substance increases the likelihood of the minor exhibiting internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Although the abuse victim does not always realize the abuse is wrong, the internal confusion can lead to chaos. Inner anger turns to outer frustration. Once aged 17/18, drink and drugs are used to numb the hurt feelings, nightmares and daytime flashbacks. Acquisitive crimes to pay for the chemicals are inevitable if the victim is unable to find employment. Unemployment and financial difficulties are associated with increased rates of child abuse. In 2009 CBS News reported that child abuse in the United States had increased during the economic recession. It gave the example of a father who had never been the primary care-taker of the children. Now that the father was in that role, the children began to come in with injuries. Parental mental health has also been seen as a factor towards child maltreatment. According to a recent Children‚Äôs HealthWatch study, mothers with positive symptoms of depression display a greater rate of food insecurity, poor health care for their children, and greater number of hospitalizations. =Worldwide= Child abuse is an international phenomenon. Poverty and substance abuse are common social problems worldwide, and no matter the location, show a similar trend in the correlation to child abuse. Differences in cultural perspectives play a significant role in how children are treated. Laws reflect the population's views on what is acceptable - for example whether child corporal punishment is legal or not. A study conducted by members from several Baltic and Eastern European countries, together with specialists from the United States, examined the causes of child abuse in the countries of Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia and Moldova. In these countries, respectively, 33%, 42%, 18% and 43% of children reported at least one type of child abuse. According to their findings, there was a series of correlations between the potential risk factors of parental employment status, alcohol abuse, and family size within the abuse ratings. In three of the four countries, parental substance abuse was considerably correlated with the presence of child abuse, and although it was a lower percentage, still showed a relationship in the fourth country (Moldova). Each country also showed a connection between the father not working outside of the home and either emotional or physical child abuse. After the fall of the communism regime, some positive changes have followed with regard to tackling child abuse. While there is a new openness and acceptance regarding parenting styles and close relationships with children, child abuse has certainly not ceased to exist. While controlling parenting may be less of a concern, financial difficulty, unemployment, and substance abuse still remain dominating factors in child abuse throughout Eastern Europe. These cultural differences can be studied from many perspectives. Most importantly, overall parental behavior is genuinely different in various countries. Each culture has their own \\"range of acceptability,\\" and what one may view as offensive, others may seem as tolerable. Behaviors that are normal to some may be viewed as abusive to others, all depending on the societal norms of that particular country. Asian parenting perspectives hold different ideals from American culture. Many have described their traditions as including physical and emotional closeness that ensures a lifelong bond between parent and child, as well as establishing parental authority and child obedience through harsh discipline.Lau, A. S., Takeuchi, D. T., & Alegr√≠a, M. (2006). Parent-to-child aggression among Asian American parents: Culture, context, and vulnerability. Journal of Marriage and Family, 68(5), 1261‚Äì1275. Retrieved Balancing disciplinary responsibilities within parenting is common in many Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam and Korea. To some cultures, forceful parenting may be seen as abuse, but in other societies such as these, the use of force is looked at as a reflection of parental devotion. The differences in these cultural beliefs demonstrate the importance of examining all cross-cultural perspectives when studying the concept of child abuse. , between 25,000 and 50,000 children in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, had been accused of witchcraft and abandoned.Dowden, Richard (12 February 2006). \\"Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve\\" . The Observer (London). In Malawi it is common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result.Byrne, Carrie (16 June 2011). \\"Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi\\" . Consultancy Africa Intelligence. In the Nigerian, Akwa Ibom State and Cross River State about 15,000 children were branded as witches.\\"Abuse of child 'witches' on rise, aid group says\\" . CNN. 18 May 2009. In April 2015, public broadcasting reported that the rate of child abuse in South Korea had increased to 13% compared with the previous year, and 75% of attackers were the children's own parents. Disclosure and assessment Suspicion for physical abuse is recommended when an injury occurs in a child who does not yet move independently, injuries are in unusual areas, more than one injury at different stages of healing, symptoms of possible head trauma, and injuries to more than one body system. In many jurisdictions, abuse that is suspected, not necessarily proven, requires reporting to child protection agencies, such as the Child Protection Services in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as primary care providers and nurses, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child‚Äôs immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad or that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. Dolls are sometimes used to help explain what happened. In Mexico, psychologists trial using cartoons to speak to children who may be more likely to disclose information than to a adult stranger. For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.Wilson, S.F.W, Giddens, J.F.G. (2009) Health Assessment for Nursing Practice. St.Louis: Mosby Elsevier, page 506. A key part of child abuse work is assessment. A few methods of assessment include projective tests, clinical interviews, and behavioral observations. *Projective tests allow for the child to express themselves through drawings, stories, or even descriptions in order to get help establish an initial understanding of the abuse that took place * Clinical interviews are comprehensive interviews performed by professionals to analyze the mental state of the one being interviewed *Behavioral observation gives an insight into things that trigger a child's memory of the abuse through observation of the child's behavior when interacting with other adults or children A particular challenge arises where child protection professionals are assessing families where neglect is occurring. Professionals conducting assessments of families where neglect is taking place can make the following errors:Williams, M. (2015) Evidence based decisions in child neglect: An evaluation of an exploratory approach to assessment using the North Carolina Family Assessment Scale , London, NSPCC. * Failure to ask the right types of question, including ** Whether neglect is occurring; ** Why neglect is occurring; ** What the situation is like for the child; ** Whether improvements in the family are likely to be sustained; ** What needs to be done to ensure the long-term safety of the child? Prevention A support- group structure is needed to reinforce parenting skills and closely monitor the child's well-being. Visiting home nurse or social-worker visits are also required to observe and evaluate the progress of the child and the caretaking situation. The support-group structure and visiting home nurse or social- worker visits are not mutually exclusive. Many studies have demonstrated that the two measures must be coupled together for the best possible outcome. Studies show that if health and medical care personnel in a structured way ask parents about important psychosocial risk factors in connection with visiting pediatric primary care and, if necessary, offering the parent help may help prevent child maltreatment. Children's school programs regarding \\"good touch ‚Ä¶ bad touch\\" can provide children with a forum in which to role-play and learn to avoid potentially harmful scenarios. Pediatricians can help identify children at risk of maltreatment and intervene with the aid of a social worker or provide access to treatment that addresses potential risk factors such as maternal depression. Videoconferencing has also been used to diagnose child abuse in remote emergency departments and clinics. Unintended conception increases the risk of subsequent child abuse, and large family size increases the risk of child neglect. Thus, a comprehensive study for the National Academy of Sciences concluded that affordable contraceptive services should form the basis for child abuse prevention. \\"The starting point for effective child abuse programming is pregnancy planning,\\" according to an analysis for US Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Findings from research published in 2016 support the importance of family relationships in the trajectory of a child‚Äôs life: family-targeted interventions are important for improving long-term health, particularly in communities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Resources for child-protection services are sometimes limited. According to Hosin (2007), \\"a considerable number of traumatized abused children do not gain access to protective child-protection strategies.\\" Briere (1992) argues that only when \\"lower-level violence\\" of children ceases to be culturally tolerated will there be changes in the victimization and police protection of children. =United States= Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long. In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed. Since 1983, April has been designated Child Abuse Prevention Month in the United States.Child Welfare Information Gateway , History of National Child Abuse Prevention Month. 3 April 2009. U.S. President Barack Obama continued that tradition by declaring April 2009 Child Abuse Prevention Month.Presidential Proclamation Marking National Child Abuse Prevention Month . The White House ‚Äì Press Room, 1 April 2009. One way the Federal government of the United States provides funding for child-abuse prevention is through Community-Based Grants for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (CBCAP).U.S. Administration for Children and Families . Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Bureau. An investigation by The Boston Globe and ProPublica published in 2019 found that the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were all out of compliance with the requirements of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and that underfunding of child welfare agencies and substandard procedures in some states caused failures to prevent avoidable child injuries and deaths. A number of policies and programs have been put in place in the U.S. to try to better understand and to prevent child abuse fatalities, including: safe-haven laws, child fatality review teams, training for investigators, shaken baby syndrome prevention programs, and child abuse death laws which mandate harsher sentencing for taking the life of a child.Douglas, E.M., 2005, Child maltreatment fatalities: What do we know, what have we learned, and where do we go from here?,pp 4.1‚Äì4.18, in Child Victimization, edited by K. Kendall-Tackett & S. Giacomoni, published by Civic Research Institute, Kingston, N.J. Treatment A number of treatments are available to victims of child abuse. However, children who experience childhood trauma do not heal from abuse easily. There are focused cognitive behavioral therapy, first developed to treat sexually abused children, is now used for victims of any kind of trauma. It targets trauma-related symptoms in children including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), clinical depression and anxiety. It also includes a component for non-offending parents. Several studies have found that sexually abused children undergoing TF-CBT improved more than children undergoing certain other therapies. Data on the effects of TF-CBT for children who experienced only non-sexual abuse was not available . The purpose of dealing with the thoughts and feelings associated with the trauma is to deal with nightmares, flashbacks and other intrusive experiences that might be spontaneously brought on by any number of discriminative stimuli in the environment or in the individual‚Äôs brain. This would aid the individual in becoming less fearful of specific stimuli that would arouse debilitating fear, anger, sadness or other negative emotion. In other words, the individual would have some control or mastery over those emotions. Parenting training can prevent child abuse in the short term, and help children with a range of emotional, conduct and behavioural challenges, but there is insufficient evidence about whether it treat parents who already abuse their children. Abuse-focused cognitive behavioral therapy was designed for children who have experienced physical abuse. It targets externalizing behaviors and strengthens prosocial behaviors. Offending parents are included in the treatment, to improve parenting skills/practices. It is supported by one randomized study. Rational Cognitive Emotive Behavior Therapy consists of ten distinct but interdependent steps. These steps fall into one of three theoretical orientations (i.e., rational or solution focused, cognitive emotive, and behavioral) and are intended to provide abused children and their adoptive parents with positive behavior change, corrective interpersonal skills, and greater control over themselves and their relationships. They are: 1) determining and normalizing thinking and behaving, 2) evaluating language, 3) shifting attention away from problem talk 4) describing times when the attachment problem isn't happening, 5) focusing on how family members \\"successfully\\" solve problematic attachment behavior; 6) acknowledging \\"unpleasant emotions\\" (i.e., angry, sad, scared) underlying negative interactional patterns, 7) identifying antecedents (controlling conditions) and associated negative cognitive emotive connections in behavior (reciprocal role of thought and emotion in behavioral causation), 8) encouraging previously abused children to experience or \\"own\\" negative thoughts and associated aversive emotional feelings, 9) modeling and rewarding positive behavior change (with themselves and in relationships), and 10) encouraging and rewarding thinking and behaving differently. This type of therapy shifts victims thoughts away from the bad and changes their behavior. Parent‚Äìchild interaction therapy was designed to improve the child-parent relationship following the experience of domestic violence. It targets trauma-related symptoms in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, including PTSD, aggression, defiance, and anxiety. It is supported by two studies of one sample. School- based programs have also been developed to treat children who are survivors of abuse. This approach teaches children, parents, teachers, and other school staff how to identify the signs of child maltreatment as well as skills that can be helpful in preventing child maltreatment. Other forms of treatment include group therapy, play therapy, and art therapy. Each of these types of treatment can be used to better assist the client, depending on the form of abuse they have experienced. Play therapy and art therapy are ways to get children more comfortable with therapy by working on something that they enjoy (coloring, drawing, painting, etc.). The design of a child's artwork can be a symbolic representation of what they are feeling, relationships with friends or family, and more. Being able to discuss and analyze a child's artwork can allow a professional to get a better insight of the child. Prevalence Child abuse is complex and difficult to study. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), estimates of the rates of child maltreatment vary widely by country, depending on how child maltreatment is defined, the type of maltreatment studied, the scope and quality of data gathered, and the scope and quality of surveys that ask for self-reports from victims, parents, and caregivers. Despite these limitations, international studies show that a quarter of all adults report experiencing physical abuse as children, and that 1 in 5 women and 1 in 13 men report experiencing childhood sexual abuse. Emotional abuse and neglect are also common childhood experiences. , an estimated 41,000 children under 15 are victims of homicide each year. The WHO states that this number underestimates the true extent of child homicide; a significant proportion of child deaths caused by maltreatment are incorrectly attributed to unrelated factors such as falls, burns, and drowning. Also, girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in situations of armed conflict and refugee settings, whether by combatants, security forces, community members, aid workers, or others. =United States= The National Research Council wrote in 1993 that \\"...the available evidence suggests that child abuse and neglect is an important, prevalent problem in the United States [...] Child abuse and neglect are particularly important compared with other critical childhood problems because they are often directly associated with adverse physical and mental health consequences in children and families\\". In 2012, Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies estimated that about 9 out of 1000 children in the United States were victims of child maltreatment. Most (78%) were victims of neglect. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other types of maltreatment, were less common, making up 18%, 9%, and 11% of cases, respectively (\\"other types\\" included emotional abuse, parental substance abuse, and inadequate supervision). According to data reported by the Children‚Äôs Bureau of the US Department of Health and Human Services, more than 3.5 million allegations of child abuse were looked into by child protective services who in turn confirmed 674,000 of those cases in 2017. However, CPS reports may underestimate the true scope of child maltreatment. A non-CPS study estimated that one in four children experience some form of maltreatment in their lifetimes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In February 2017, the American Public Health Association published a Washington University study estimating 37% of American children experienced a child protective services investigation by age 18 (or 53% if African American). According to David Finkelhor who tracked Child Maltreatment Report (NCANDS) data from 1990 to 2010, sexual abuse had declined 62% from 1992 to 2009 and the long-term trend for physical abuse was also down by 56% since 1992. He stated: \\"It is unfortunate that information about the trends in child maltreatment are not better publicized and more widely known. The long-term decline in sexual and physical abuse may have important implications for public policy.\\" In 1998, Douglas Besharov, the first Director of the U.S. Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, stated \\"the existing laws are often vague and overly broad\\" and there was a \\"lack of consensus among professionals and Child Protective Services (CPS), personnel about what the terms abuse and neglect mean\\". In 1999, Susan Orr, former head of the United States Children's Bureau U.S. Department of Health and Services Administration for Children and Families, 2001‚Äì2007, stated that \\"much that is now defined as child abuse and neglect does not merit governmental interference\\". A child abuse fatality occurs when a child's death is the result of abuse or neglect, or when abuse or neglect are contributing factors to a child's death. In the United States, 1,730 children died in 2008 due to factors related to abuse; this is a rate of 2 per 100,000 U.S. children.Child Maltreatment 2008 , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, p. 55. Family situations which place children at risk include moving, unemployment, and having non-family members living in the household. A number of policies and programs have been put in place in the U.S. to try to better understand and to prevent child abuse fatalities, including: safe-haven laws, child fatality review teams, training for investigators, shaken baby syndrome prevention programs, and child abuse death laws which mandate harsher sentencing for taking the life of a child. In 1995, a one off judicial decision found that parents failing to sufficiently speak the national standard language at home to their children was a form of child abuse by a judge in a child custody matter. Examples =Child trafficking= A child soldier in El Salvador, 1990. Child trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of children for the purpose of exploitation. Children are trafficked for purposes such as of commercial sexual exploitation, bonded labour, camel jockeying, child domestic labour, drug couriering, child soldiering, illegal adoptions, begging. It is difficult to obtain reliable estimates concerning the number of children trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of the practice. The International Labour Organization estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year. =Child labor= Child labor refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, or is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful. The International Labour Organization considers such labor to be a form of exploitation and abuse of children. Child labor refers to those occupations which infringe the development of children (due to the nature of the job or lack of appropriate regulation) and does not include age appropriate and properly supervised jobs in which minors may participate. According to ILO, globally, around 215 million children work, many full-time. Many of these children do not go to school, do not receive proper nutrition or care, and have little or no time to play. More than half of them are exposed to the worst forms of child labor, such as child prostitution, drug trafficking, armed conflicts and other hazardous environments. There exist several international instruments protecting children from child labor, including the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. More girls under 16 work as domestic workers than any other category of child labor, often sent to cities by parents living in rural poverty such as in restaveks in Haiti. =Forced adoption= In Switzerland, between the 1850s and the mid-20th century, hundreds of thousands of children were forcefully removed from their parents by the authorities, and sent to work on farms, living with new families. These children usually came from poor or single parents, and were used as free labor by farmers, and were known as contract children or Verdingkinder. In some Western countries throughout the 20th century and until the 1970s, children from certain ethnic minority origins were forcefully removed from their families and communities by state and church authorities and forced to \\"assimilate\\". Such policies include the Stolen Generations (in Australia for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children) and the Canadian Indian residential school system (in Canada for First Nations, M√©tis and Inuit), with such children often suffering severe abuse. During the One Child Policy in China, women were only allowed to have one child. Local governments would allow the woman to give birth and then they would take the baby away stating the mother violated the one child policy. Child traffickers, often paid by the government, would sell the children to orphanages that would arrange international adoptions worth tens of thousands of dollars, turning a profit for the government. Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children's development by separating them from their families and that it would be more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.Aid gives alternatives to African orphanages =Gender based violence against girls= Infanticide Under natural conditions, mortality rates for girls under five are slightly lower than boys for biological reasons. However, after birth, neglect and diverting resources to male children can lead to some countries having a skewed ratio with more boys than girls, with such practices killing an approximate 230,000 girls under five in India each year. While sex- selective abortion is more common among the higher income population, who can access medical technology, abuse after birth, such as infanticide and abandonment, is more common among the lower income population. Female infanticide in Pakistan is a common practice. Methods proposed to deal with the issue are baby hatches to drop off unwanted babies and safe-haven laws, which decriminalize abandoning babies unharmed. Female genital mutilation A map showing the prevalence of FGM, according to a 2013 UNICEF report. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \\"all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\\" It is practiced mainly in 28 countries in Africa, and in parts of Asia and the Middle East.\\"An update on WHO's work on female genital mutilation (FGM)\\" , World Health Organization, 2011, p. 2: \\"Most women who have experienced FGM live in one of the 28 countries in Africa and the Middle East ‚Äì nearly half of them in just two countries: Egypt and Ethiopia. Countries in which FGM has been documented include: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Yemen. The prevalence of FGM ranges from 0.6% to 98% of the female population.\\" * Rahman, Anika and Toubia, Nahid. Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Laws and Policies Worldwide. Zed Books, 2000 (hereafter Rahman and Toubia 2000), p. 7: \\"Currently, FC/FGM is practiced in 28 African countries in the sub-Saharan and Northeastern regions.\\" * Also see \\"Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation\\" , World Health Organization, 2008, p. 4: \\"Types I, II and III female genital mutilation have been documented in 28 countries in Africa and in a few countries in Asia and the Middle East.\\" FGM is mostly found in a geographical area ranging across Africa, from east to west ‚Äì from Somalia to Senegal, and from north to south ‚Äì from Egypt to Tanzania. FGM is most often carried out on young girls aged between infancy and 15 years. FGM is classified into four types, of which type 3 ‚Äì infibulation ‚Äì is the most extreme form. The consequences of FGM include physical, emotional and sexual problems, and include serious risks during childbirth. In Western countries this practice is illegal and considered a form of child abuse. The countries which choose to ratify the Istanbul Convention, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence, are bound by its provisions to ensure that FGM is criminalized.See Article 38 ‚Äì Female genital mutilation , page 11 In Australia, all states and territories have outlawed FGM. In the United States, performing FGM on anyone under the age of 18 became illegal in 1996 with the Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act. Sexual initiation of virgins A tradition often performed in some regions in Africa involves a man initiating a girl into womanhood by having sex with her, usually after her first period, in a practice known as \\"sexual cleansing\\". The rite can last for three days and there is an increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections as the ritual requires condoms not be worn. Breast ironing The practice of using hot stones or other implements to flatten the breast tissue of pubescent girls is widespread in Cameroon and exists elsewhere in West Africa as well. It is believed to have come with that diaspora to Britain, where the government declared it a form of child abuse and said that it could be prosecuted under existing assault laws. Violence against girl students Attacks on schoolgirls in Afghanistan are common In some parts of the world, girls are strongly discouraged from attending school, which some argue is because they fear losing power to women. They are sometimes attacked by members of the community if they do so. In parts of South Asia, girls schools are set on fire by vigilante groups. Such attacks are common in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Notable examples include the kidnapping of hundreds of female students in Chibok in 2014 and Dapchi in 2018. =Child marriage= A child marriage is a marriage in which one or both participants are minors, often before the age of puberty. Child marriages are common in many parts of the world, especially in parts of Asia and Africa. The United Nations considers those below the age of 18 years to be incapable of giving valid consent to marriage and therefore regards such marriages as a form of forced marriage; and that marriages under the age of majority have significant potential to constitute a form of child abuse. In many countries, such practices are lawful or ‚Äî even where laws prohibit child marriage ‚Äî often unenforced. India has more child brides than any other nation, with 40% of the world total. The countries with the highest rates of child marriage are: Niger (75%), Central African Republic and Chad (68%), and Bangladesh (66%). Bride kidnapping is common in Central Asia Bride kidnapping, also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture, has been practiced around the world and throughout history, and sometimes involves minors. It is still practiced in parts of Central Asia, the Caucasus region, and some African countries. In Ethiopia, marriage by abduction is widespread, and many young girls are kidnapped this way. In most countries, bride kidnapping, in which a male abducts the female he wants to marry, is considered a criminal offense rather than a valid form of marriage. In many cases, the groom also rapes his kidnapped bride, in order to prevent her from returning to her family due to shame. Sacred prostitution often involves girls being pledged to priests or those of higher castes, such as fetish slaves in West Africa. =Violence against children with superstitious accusations= Customary beliefs in witchcraft are common in many parts of the world, even among the educated. Anthropologists have argued that the disabled are often viewed as bad omens as raising a child with a disability in such communities are an insurmountable hurdle. This is found in Africa and in communities in the Amazon. Children who are specifically at risk include orphans, street-children, albinos, disabled children, children who are unusually gifted, children who were born prematurely or in unusual positions, twins, children of single mothers and children who express gender identity issues. Consequently, those accused of being a witch are ostracized and subjected to punishment, torture and even murdered,Mbiti, John 1975. Introduction to African Religion (2nd rev. ed.). Oxford: Heinemann: 117‚Äì118, 165.Moreau, A. Scott 1990. The World of the Spirits: A Bible Study in the African Context. Nairobi: Evangel, p. 116. often by being buried alive or left to starve. For example, in southern Ethiopia, children with physical abnormalities are considered to be ritually impure or mingi, the latter are believed to exert an evil influence upon others, so disabled infants have traditionally been disposed of without a proper burial. Reports by UNICEF, UNHCR, Save The Children and Human Rights Watch have highlighted the violence and abuse towards children accused of witchcraft in Africa.Bussien, Nathaly et al. 2011. Breaking the spell: Responding to witchcraft accusations against children, in New Issues in refugee Research (197). Geneva, Switzerland: UNHCRCimpric, Aleksandra 2010. Children accused of witchcraft, An anthropological study of contemporary practices in Africa. Dakar, Senegal: UNICEF WCAROMolina, Javier Aguilar 2006. The Invention of Child Witches in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Social cleansing, religious commerce and the difficulties of being a parent in an urban culture. London: Save the ChildrenHuman Rights Watch 2006. Children in the DRC. Human Rights Watch report, 18 (2) A 2010 UNICEF report describes children as young as eight being burned, beaten and even killed as punishment for suspected witchcraft. The report notes that accusations against children are a recent phenomenon; women and the elderly were formerly more likely to be accused. UNICEF attributes the rise in vulnerable children being abused in this way to increased urbanization and social disruption caused by war.\\"Rise in African children accused of witchcraft\\". BBC News, 17 July 2010. Ethics One of the most challenging ethical dilemmas arising from child abuse relates to the parental rights of abusive parents or caretakers with regard to their children, particularly in medical settings. In the United States, the 2008 New Hampshire case of Andrew Bedner drew attention to this legal and moral conundrum. Bedner, accused of severely injuring his infant daughter, sued for the right to determine whether or not she remain on life support; keeping her alive, which would have prevented a murder charge, created a motive for Bedner to act that conflicted with the apparent interests of his child.\\"Springfield man denies charges in infant assault\\", Rutland Herald, New Hampshire, 5 August 2008.\\"Springfield Father Charged with Baby's Murder\\" , WCAX.com, Vermont, 21 January 2009. Bioethicists Jacob M. Appel and Thaddeus Mason Pope recently argued, in separate articles, that such cases justify the replacement of the accused parent with an alternative decision-maker.\\"Withdrawal Okay When Surrogate's Refusal to Consent Based on Wrong Reasons\\" , Medical Futility (blog). Child abuse also poses ethical concerns related to confidentiality, as victims may be physically or psychologically unable to report abuse to authorities. Accordingly, many jurisdictions and professional bodies have made exceptions to standard requirements for confidentiality and legal privileges in instances of child abuse. Medical professionals, including doctors, therapists, and other mental health workers typically owe a duty of confidentiality to their patients and clients, either by law or the standards of professional ethics, and cannot disclose personal information without the consent of the individual concerned. This duty conflicts with an ethical obligation to protect children from preventable harm. Accordingly, confidentiality is often waived when these professionals have a good faith suspicion that child abuse or neglect has occurred or is likely to occur and make a report to local child protection authorities. This exception allows professionals to breach confidentiality and make a report even when children or their parents or guardians have specifically instructed to the contrary. Child abuse is also a common exception to physician‚Äìpatient privilege: a medical professional may be called upon to testify in court as to otherwise privileged evidence about suspected child abuse despite the wishes of children or their families. Some child abuse policies in Western countries have been criticized both by some conservatives, who claim such policies unduly interfere in the privacy of the family, and by some feminists of the left wing, who claim such policies disproportionally target and punish disadvantaged women who are often themselves in vulnerable positions. There has also been concern that ethnic minority families are disproportionally targeted. Legislation =Canada= Laws and legislation against child abuse are enacted on the provincial and Federal Territories level. Investigations into child abuse are handled by Provincial and Territorial Authorities through government social service departments and enforcement is through local police and courts.https://cwrp.ca/frequently-asked-questions- faqs =Germany= In Germany the abuse and the attempted abuse of vulnerable persons (including children) is punishable according to the German Criminal code ¬ß 225 with a from 6 months to 10 years. However, crimes against children must be prosecuted within 10 years of the victims reaching 18 years of age. As of 2020, Germany and the Netherlands are 2 out of all 27 EU countries that do not have any reporting obligations for civilians or professionals. There is no mandatory reporting law, which would grant reporters of child abuse anonymity and immunity. =US= In the 1960s mandatory reporting in the United States was introduced. In 1974, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act was introduced. As of April 2019, only 18 states had legislation requiring that mandated reporters report based on suspicion of child abuse of neglect. Advocacy organizations =United States of America= There are organizations at national, state, and county levels in the United States that provide community leadership in preventing child abuse and neglect. The National Alliance of Children's Trust Funds and Prevent Child Abuse America are two national organizations with member organizations at the state level. Many investigations into child abuse are handled on the local level by Child Advocacy Centers. Started over 25 years ago at what is now known as the National Children's Advocacy Center in Huntsville, Alabama by District Attorney Robert \\"Bud\\" Cramer these multi-disciplinary teams have met to coordinate their efforts so that cases of child abuse can be investigated quickly and efficiently, ultimately reducing trauma to the child and garnering better convictions. These Child Advocacy Centers (known as CACs) have standards set by the National Children's Alliance. Other organizations focus on specific prevention strategies. The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome focuses its efforts on the specific issue of preventing child abuse that is manifested as shaken baby syndrome. Mandated reporter training is a program used to prevent ongoing child abuse. NICHD, also known as the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development is a broad organization, but helps victims of child abuse through one of its branches. Through the Child Development and Behavior (CDB) Branch, NICHD raises awareness efforts by supporting research projects to better understand the short- and long-term impacts of child abuse and neglect. They provide programs and observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month every April since 1984. The United States Children's Bureau leads activities for the Month, including the release of updated statistics about child abuse and neglect, candlelight vigils, and fundraisers to support prevention activities and treatment for victims. The Bureau also sponsors a \\"Blue Ribbon Campaign,\\" in which people wear blue ribbons in memory of children who have died from abuse, or in honor of individuals and organizations that have taken important steps to prevent child abuse and neglect. =Canada= Charitable organizations exist in each province to assist children and families with abuse.

Originally, Windows-936 covered GB 2312 (in its EUC-CN form), but it was expanded to cover most of GBK with the release of Windows 95. IBM's Code page 936 is a different encoding for Simplified Chinese, although International Components for Unicode does not include an IBM-936 codec, and uses the Windows code page for the \\"cp936\\" label. IBM's code page for GBK coverage is Code page 1386 (CP1386 or IBM-1386), which is defined as a combination of the single byte Code page 1114 and the double byte Code page 1385. It was superseded by code page 54936 (GB 18030), but was still prevalent in use. The Windows command prompt uses CP936 as the default code page for simplified Chinese installations, although part of the GB 18030 was made mandatory for all software products sold in China. In 2002, the IANA Internet name GBK was registered with Windows-936's mapping,Application of IANA Charset Registration for GBK making it the de facto GBK definition on the Internet. The concepts of \\"Windows-936\\", \\"GBK\\", \\"GB2312\\" and \\"EUC-CN\\" are sometimes confused in various software products. Code pages MS936 and 1386 are not identical to GBK because a code page encodes characters, whereas GBK only defines code points. In addition, the Euro sign (‚Ç¨), encoded as 0x80 in both Windows-936 and IBM-1386, is not defined in GBK. On the other hand, 95 characters defined in GBK were initially not encoded into Windows-936. This is partly resolved in later versions of Windows and, as in Windows 7, all GBK characters not in the Unicode BMP Private Use Area can be displayed using code page 936, but encoding the 95 characters was still not supported . However, \\"CP936\\" and \\"GBK\\" are often used interchangeably because of the popularity of Microsoft products on the Chinese market when GBK was then published. Since GBK superseded GB 2312 long ago, these two terms have also become virtually equivalent to many users, so \\"Windows-936\\", \\"GBK\\" and \\"GB 2312\\" are misunderstood by many to mean the same thing while they actually differ significantly. Instead of supporting precisely EUC-CN / GB 2312, most modern- day Windows-based software products mean partial support for GBK via Windows-936 when they use the term \\"GB 2312\\" as a character encoding option. This can be observed in products such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Notepad++.

Monitory Democracy The term monitory democracy is introduced in Keane's The Life and Death of Democracy (2009).John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p.xxvii and part 3 of the book It claims that from around 1945 democracy entered a new historical phase.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 688 In the age of 'monitory democracy', the language and ideals and institutions of democracy undergo many changes. For the first time in its history, democracy has grown familiar to people living within most regions of the earth, regardless of their language, nationality, religion or civilisation.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 676 This process of 'indigenisation' helps explain why, again for the first time, there is an explosion of many different understandings of democracy (for many people, especially in poorer countries, it becomes synonymous with justice, electricity, sanitation and other public goods); and why there are references to 'global democracy' and much talk of democracy as a universal ideal.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 852 Democracy becomes globally accepted as the political governing form par excellence. For the first time as well, racial prejudice is said to be incompatible with the ideals of democracy. In contrast to the age of representative democracy, which ended just prior to World War Two, many democrats consequently feel embarrassed or angered by talk of 'naturally inferior', or 'backward' or 'uncivilised' peoples.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. xxiii and p. 676 =Synopsis= In the age of monitory democracy, less obviously, there are indications that the theory and practice of democracy are mutating, that its significance is changing because its institutions are being stretched into areas of life in which democracy in any form was previously excluded, or played only a limited role.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, pp. 709 ‚Äì 710 Once seen as the rule of the people, by the people and for the people, democracy is viewed more pragmatically, as a vital weapon for guaranteeing political equality against concentrations of publicly unaccountable power. That is what monitory democracy means: the ongoing public scrutiny and public control of decision makers, whether they operate in the field of government or inter-governmental institutions, or within so-called non-governmental or civil society organisations, such as businesses, trade unions, sports associations and charities.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, pp. 688‚Äì9 In the age of monitory democracy, in contrast to the earlier eras of assembly democracy and representative democracy in territorial state form, many new mechanisms are mixed and combined with new ways of publicly monitoring and controlling the exercise of power. Representative forms of government do not simply wither, or disappear.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 690 Elections remain important and representative democracy within the framework of territorial states often survives, and in some countries it even thrives, sometimes (as in Mongolia, Taiwan and South Africa) for the first time ever.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. xxvi Efforts to renew representative government are commonplace, as in the civic involvement and clean-up schemes (machizukuri) in Japanese cities such as Yokohama and Kawasaki during the past several decades. However, for a variety of reasons that are related to public pressure and the need to reduce corruption and the abuse of power, conventional representative forms of democracy are coming to be supplemented (and hence complicated) by a variety of democratic innovations that are applied to organisations underneath and beyond governments.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. xxvii Others include public integrity mechanisms, congresses, blogging and other new forms of media scrutiny,John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. xxvii as well as cross-border parliaments and open methods of co-ordination,John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, pp. 689- 690 of the kind practised in the European Union. The inventions are unique to the age of monitory democracy, and they fundamentally alter both the political geometry and dynamics of democracy. Democracy becomes nothing less but much more than electoral democracy. According to Keane, although its future is by no means guaranteed, monitory democracy is the most intricate, complex and dynamic form of democracy, a type of post-electoral democracy that has long- term consequences and disorientating effects upon political parties, parliaments, politicians and governments. He concludes that in the age of public monitoring of power, democracy can no longer be seen as a done deal or as already achieved.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. xxxiii Monitory democracy is an unfinished experiment that both thrives on imperfection and requires fresh ways of thinking about democracy's virtues and its imperfections and failures.John Keane, The Life and Death of Democracy, London: Simon & Schuster, 2009, p. 866 References External links * John Keane homepage * John Keane's The Life and Death of Democracy * Video: John Keane in conversation, Melbourne Writers Festival 2009 * *IDHR representative speaks at the protest, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3KVTSjA3wg 1949 births Academics of the University of Westminster Living people Australian political philosophers British political philosophers Political theories ","title":"John Keane (political theorist)"},{"id":"2955590","text":"Dignitas is a Latin word referring to a unique, intangible, and culturally subjective social concept in the ancient Roman mindset. The word does not have a direct translation in English. Some interpretations include \\"dignity\\", which is a derivation from \\"dignitas\\", and \\"prestige\\" or \\"charisma\\". Dignitas was the influence a male citizen acquired throughout his life, including personal reputation, moral standing, and ethical worth, along with the man's entitlement to respect and proper treatment owing to the reputation and standing of his family. The Oxford Latin Dictionary defines the expression as fitness, suitability, worthiness, visual impressiveness or distinction, dignity of style and gesture, rank, status, position, standing, esteem, importance, and honor. Origins Authors who had used dignitas extensively in their writings and oratories include Cicero, Julius Caesar, Tacitus, and Livy. The most prolific user was Cicero, who initially related it to the established term auctoritas (authority). These two words were highly associated, with the latter defined as the expression of a man's dignitas. Personal significance The cultivation of dignitas in ancient Rome was extremely personal. Men of all classes, most particularly noblemen of consular families, were highly protective and zealous of this asset. This is because every man who took on a higher political office during the Roman Republic considered dignitas as comprising much more than just his dignity. It referred to his \\"good name\\" (his past and present reputation, achievement, standing, and honor). Its importance within the hierarchical classes of Roman society meant many historical figures would kill, commit suicide (e.g. Mark Antony), or enter exile in order to preserve their dignitas. Influence on conflict The personal significance of one's dignitas had encouraged several conflicts in ancient Rome. Florus claimed that the stubbornness of Cato the Younger had driven Pompeius Magnus to prepare defenses in order to build up his dignitas. Cicero wrote that Caesar valued his status so greatly that he did not want anyone to be his equal in dignitas. Aulus Hirtius had written that Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who was one of the instigators of Caesar's recall from Gaul, had attempted to build all of his own reputation on his success on turning people's feelings against Caesar. Whether the exact term was used much during these times is unknown; however, the concept of dignitas was certainly influential and worth fighting for. Changing definition Over the course of ancient Roman history, dignitas had never taken on all of the aforementioned descriptions simultaneously. The term took on different meanings over time, adjusting for the gradually changing viewpoints of society, politicians, and the various authors. Years after Caesar's death, his heir Augustus rejected the contemporary meaning of dignitas. Augustus found the related term auctoritas to be a suitable alternative. In 46 BC, Cicero cited the ambiguous nature of the concept of dignitas. He wrote, \\"And so I have, if loyal feeling for the state and winning good men's approval of those loyal feelings is all that dignitas amounts to; but if in dignitas you include the power of translating those loyal feelings into action or of defending them with complete freedom, then ne vestigium quidem ullum est reliquum nobis dignitatis [not even a trace is left to us of our dignity].\\" Combination of dignitas and otium When paired with the term otium, the word dignitas took on a different meaning. Cicero did not consider himself worthy of having dignitas alone because he felt that--by turning his back on the Roman public--he had neglected the duty of one whose life had normally exemplified the concept. He then altered the definition to mean \\"[lifetime] impact,\\" to better describe his unique status. By this time, Cicero's political life had ended, and he labeled his past political influence as his dignitas, and his present standing as otium.

Its name derives from two n√°huatl words, \\"mexcalli\\" and \\"titl√°n\\". Some historians have raised the possibility that it was the Aztlan of the Aztecs, their home city and birthplace from where they set out on their pilgrimage in 1091 that led them to the founding of Tenochtitlan. This island is now being promoted as a tourist attraction. It was designated a \\"Pueblo M√°gico\\" by the federal government, but the distinction only lasted one year. It is accessible by boat from La Batanga, which is the dock area located some 40 kilometers from Santiago Ixcuintla. It is known as \\"The Mexican Venice\\" (La Venecia Mexicana). Plan of Mexcaltitan The principal tourist attraction of the island consists of its colorful houses with traditional water resistant roofs. During the rainy season it is necessary to travel by boat due to flooding in the streets.  Geographic Location  The island is approximately 1100' (335m) in diameter, nearly round in shape.Mexcaltitan de Uribe - Google Maps (accessed 9 May 2019) Currently it is a nationally recognized tourist center, located 22.3 mi (36 km) from the city of Santiago Ixcuintla, and 60 mi (98 km) from the city of Tepic. = History = During the 1960s, Mexican intellectuals began to seriously speculate about the possibility that Mexcaltit√°n was the mythical city of Aztl√°n, from where the mexicas (later known as the aztecs) left to initiate their pilgrimage. One of the first to consider Aztl√°n being linked to the Nayaritian island was historian Alfredo Chavero towards the end of the 19th century. Historical investigators after his death tested his proposition and considered it valid, among them Wigberto Jim√©nez Moreno. This hypothesis is still up for debate. In July 2009 the title of Pueblo M√°gico was taken from the island city by the Mexican Secretary of Tourism, because it didn't comply with the observations made by the Comit√© T√©cnico during the National Meeting of Pueblos M√°gicos which took place in February of the same year in Tapalpa, Jalisco. = Demographics = In the 2010 INEGI census, the island had 818 inhabitants. = Infrastructure = Among many outstanding buildings, the city consists of a museum, a catholic church, the commission of ejido, an elementary school and a government operated hospital. The island is served by 2 ferries: La Batanga, the most transited, 3.7 mi (6 km) away from Mexcaltit√°n and El Matadero, smaller than the other, 1.2 mi (2 km) away from the island. The ejido (public farmland allotted to citizens) of Mexcaltit√°n consists of an extensive area of land and water, and is considered considerably superior to other nearby ejidos in the same district consisting of the cities of El Mezcal, Aztl√°n de las Garzas, San Miguel N¬∫ 2, El Nuevo Mexcaltit√°n and San Vicente.

The stunt is generally performed by driving one pair of wheels up on a ramp to lift one side of the car. Alternately, the stunt can be done in a vehicle with a high center of gravity (such as a 4x4 or SUV) by turning sharply or at speed. This technique is more dangerous because there is a strong possibility of the vehicle tipping completely over. Another technique is to let some air out of the tires that will be on the ground, so that the car can tip more easily, as well as keep its balance better. Once up on two wheels, the car has to be balanced by steering (much as one would when riding a bicycle), which makes it necessary to drive more or less in a straight line. The vehicle used must also be fitted with a lockable differential (common on 4x4s). The stunt was perfected and first performed at the 1964 World Fair by Tonny Peterson of Copenhagen, Denmark. Famous uses The stunt has been used in many movies and television series, including Knight Rider, The Dukes of Hazzard, and two of the James Bond movies. The British stunt driver Russ Swift performs this maneuver as part of his shows and has achieved it in a wide range of vehicles including trucks. His son Paul also uses it in his displays and once rolled a Ford Fiesta whilst attempting to drive around Cardiff's Millennium Stadium at the Wales Rally GB in 2005. In the Knight Rider series, KITT had a function button on the dashboard called \\"Ski Mode\\" which, when pressed, would cause KITT to drive on two wheels. The stunt was also used by the character Bumblebee in the 2007 Transformers film, in a scene just before the robot changes the exterior disguise from the 1976 Chevrolet Camaro to the 2009 Camaro. In the movie, Bumblebee's retro look is insulted by Mikaela Banes, and Bumblebee stops to eject her and Sam Witwicky from the car. Bumblebee then drives off and skis on two wheels past a 2009 Camaro that drives by and scans it. Bumblebee then returns moments later to Sam and Mikaela, surprising the two, as the newer version of the car. It is also featured in the film Transporter 3 to ski between two semi trucks in an escape bid by the film's main characters. The stunt is featured prominently in M.I.A.'s music video for Bad Girls. It is also featured in the 1985 film D.A.R.Y.L. - Daryl is driving in a car chase to escape from the army.

This colourless hygroscopic liquid is soluble in water and polar organic solvents, but not simple hydrocarbons. Diethylenetriamine is structural analogue of diethylene glycol. Its chemical properties resemble those for ethylene diamine, and it has similar uses. It is a weak base and its aqueous solution is alkaline. DETA is a byproduct of the production of ethylenediamine from ethylene dichloride. Reactions and uses Diethylenetriamine is a common curing agent for epoxy resins in epoxy adhesives and other thermosets. It is N-alkylated upon reaction with epoxide groups forming crosslinks. Structure of a triamine-cured epoxy glue. The resin's epoxide groups have all reacted with the hardener. The resulting highly crosslinked material contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties. In coordination chemistry, it serves as a tridentate ligand forming complexes such as Co(dien)(NO2)3. Like some related amines, it is used in oil industry for the extraction of acid gas. Like ethylenediamine, DETA can also be used to sensitize nitromethane, making a liquid explosive compound similar to PLX. This compound is cap sensitive with an explosive velocity of around 6200 m/s and is discussed in patent #3,713,915. Mixed with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine it was used as Hydyne, a propellent for liquid-fuel rockets. DETA has been evaluated for use in the Countermine System under development by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, where it would be used to ignite and consume the explosive fill of land mines in beach and surf zones.

It was a passenger/liaison amphibian aircraft with a layout similar to the Be-4 but substantially larger and heavier. It was a single engined parasol winged aircraft, with the wing installed on a thin pylon and a pair of short struts. Compared to the Be-4, the Be-8 was equipped with retractable landing gear, with cockpit and passenger cabins heated by an engine exhaust heat exchanger. The Be-8 was intended as a civil aircraft and carried no armament. First flight was on 3 December 1947, demonstrating good performance and of the two prototypes, one was demonstrated during the 1951 Soviet Aviation Day at Tushino. One of Be-8 was equipped with hydrofoils, developed at TsAGI. These \\"Underwater Wings\\" were installed on landing gear struts and raised the aircraft above the water, well before the aerodynamic lift could support the aircraft. As a result, takeoff was much easier and imposed less punishment on the hull from the waves. Despite being very effective during take-off, the hydrofoils resulted in increased drag and a reduction in maximum airspeed. Construction of retractable hydrofoils was not ready, and the concept did not find practical applications. Specifications (Be-8) References * Gunston, Bill.

His artistic career was short and his output limited because his eyesight began to fail in the 1950s, but his work is on display at the National Portrait Gallery, Tate Gallery and Imperial War Museum. Biography =Early life= Frampton was born in the St John's Wood area of London and was the only child of the sculptor Sir George Frampton and his wife, the painter Christabel Cockerell. Frampton was educated at Westminster School and after some months learning to speak French in Geneva he enrolled at the St John's Wood School of Art. He went on to attend the Royal Academy Schools between 1912 and 1915, where he won both a first prize and a silver medal. =World War I= During the First World War, Frampton served in the British Army on the Western Front with a field survey unit, sketching enemy trenches, and also worked on the interpretation of aerial photographs. After the war Frampton resumed his artistic career and established himself as among the most highly regarded of British painters during the period. Between 1920 and 1945 he exhibited at the Royal Academy nearly every year, showing a total of thirty-two paintings there. Frampton was an early member of the Society of Graphic Art and exhibited there in 1921. In 1925 he was elected a member of the Art Workers Guild. In 1934 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy and in 1942 became a full member of the Academy. Frampton painted portraits of the Duke of York, who was to become King George VI, academics and scientists, and a series of full length portraits of women from fashionable society. He would often spend an entire year working on a single painting. Frampton painted in smooth colours without visible brushstrokes, achieving a look of almost photographic realism. Most of his paintings were commissions, but a notable exception was Portrait of A Young Woman, which Frampton showed at the Royal Academy in 1935 and which was purchased for the Tate. Frampton had several of the objects in the painting made specially for the painting and his mother made the dress worn by the model, Margaret Austin- Jones. She modelled for him again in one of his most famous works, A Game of Patience (1937), now hanging in the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull. =World War II and later life= During World War Two, Frampton received two commissions from the War Artists' Advisory Committee. One was intended for the Admiralty, but a suitable subject was not found and the painting was never made. Frampton's other WAAC commission was for a portrait of Sir Ernest Gowers, which became a triple portrait of Gowers and his colleagues in their underground control room in Kensington. In 1953 Frampton requested that the Royal Academy place him on its list of retired members. His eyesight had begun to worsen, convincing him that he could no longer paint to his previous high standard and with such meticulous detail. With his wife he moved to a hilltop house overlooking Monkton Deverill in Wiltshire. Frampton had designed the property in the 1930s and for the rest of his life he worked on improving and maintaining this house, which included his own furniture and clock designs. For many years Frampton's art was rarely shown in public and he was largely forgotten. However, he lived to see his retrospective at the Tate in 1982. It was his first one-man show and greatly restored his standing. =Posthumous usage= In 2016 Penguin Classics began employing a series of Frampton's paintings for new editions of the complete works of Russian writer Vladimir Nabokov.

This oily liquid is colorless but, like many amines, assumes a yellowish color due to impurities resulting from air-oxidation. It is soluble in polar solvents. The branched isomer tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and piperazine derivatives may also be present in commercial samples of TETA. Uses The reactivity and uses of TETA are similar to those for the related polyamines ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine. It is primarily used as a crosslinker (\\"hardener\\") in epoxy curing. = Medical uses = The hydrochloride salt of TETA, referred to as trientine hydrochloride, is a chelating agent that is used to bind and remove copper in the body to treat Wilson's disease, particularly in those who are intolerant to penicillamine. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive. Trientine hydrochloride (brand name Syprine) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 1985. Trientine tetrahydrochloride (brand name Cuprior) was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 2017. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. It is indicated for the treatment of Wilson's disease in adults, adolescents and children five years of age or older who are intolerant to D-penicillamine therapy.

It is indicated for the treatment of Wilson's disease in adults, adolescents and children five years of age or older who are intolerant to D-penicillamine therapy. The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), especially when starting treatment, skin rash, duodenitis (inflammation of the duodenum, the part of the gut leading out of the stomach), and severe colitis (inflammation in the large bowel causing pain and diarrhea).  Society and culture  = Controversies = In the United States, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International raised the price of its Syprine brand of TETA from $625 to $21,267 for 100 pills over five years. The New York Times said that this \\"egregious\\" price increase caused public outrage. Teva Pharmaceuticals developed a generic, which patients and doctors expected to be cheaper, but when it was introduced in February 2018, Teva's price was $18,375 for 100 pills. Aaron Kesselheim, who studies drug pricing at Harvard Medical School, said that drug companies price the product at what they think the market will bear. Production TETA is prepared by heating ethylenediamine or ethanolamine/ammonia mixtures over an oxide catalyst. This process gives a variety of amines, especially ethylene amines which are separated by distillation and sublimation. Coordination chemistry TETA is a tetradentate ligand in coordination chemistry, where it is referred to as trien. Octahedral complexes of the type M(trien)Cl3 can adopt several diastereomeric structures, most of which are chiral.

It is the oldest surviving presidential residence, having twice housed George Washington during his presidency. Construction and ownership The house's alternate name comes from its first and last owners: David Deshler, who built it beginning in 1752; and Elliston P. Morris, who donated it to the National Park Service in 1948. The rear of the house shows the earliest construction. Deshler, a merchant, bought a lot from George and Anna Bringhurst in 1751‚Äì52, and constructed a four-room summer cottage. Twenty years later he built a 3-story, 9-room addition to the front, creating one of the most elegant homes in the region. Isaac Franks, a former colonel in the Continental Army, bought the house following Deshler's 1792 death. It was he who rented it to President Washington. Later, the house was sold to Elliston and John Perot, and in 1834 to Elliston's son-in-law, Samuel B. Morris. The Morris family lived in the house for over a hundred years, before its 1948 donation to the National Park Service. History =Revolutionary War= On October 4, 1777, it was a scene of fighting in the Battle of Germantown, after which British General Sir William Howe occupied the house. =1793= When the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 struck Philadelphia, President Washington remained in the city until September, before making his regular autumn trip home to Mount Vernon. He and a small group of slaves returned in early November, but Philadelphia was under quarantine and they were rerouted to Germantown, then ten miles (16 km) outside the city.Philadelphia County, including Germantown, was absorbed into the City of Philadelphia in 1854. He first occupied the Dove House, the headmaster's residence for Germantown Academy (now extensively altered and part of Pennsylvania School for the Deaf). He also traveled to Reading, Pennsylvania, 60 miles (96 km) northwest of the city, to see if it would make a suitable emergency capital. Returning to Germantown, from November 16 to 30, he occupied the Isaac Franks house. His wife Martha, two of her grandchildren, Eleanor Parke Custis and George Washington Parke Custis, and more of their slaves and staff joined him late in the stay. =1794= The following September and October, Washington and his family returned to the Franks house for vacation, although he left early to deal with the Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania. He met there four times with his cabinet: Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Attorney General Edmund Randolph, and Secretary of War Henry Knox. The President posed for painter Gilbert Stuart, who kept a studio nearby, and the family attended the German Reformed Church across the square. Four slaves were held by the Washingtons at the Franks house: Oney Judge, Austin (her brother), Moll, and Hercules. Preservation Restored second floor dining room The house is administered by Independence National Historical Park. In 1972, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is also a contributing property of the Colonial Germantown Historic District. In 2009, the National Park Service changed the official name of the house from the \\"Deshler-Morris House\\" to the \\"Germantown White House.\\" Bringhurst House The Bringhurst House, neighboring the Germantown White House on the northwest, was originally owned by John Bringhurst (February 19, 1725 ‚Äì March 18, 1795), a carriage builder and inventor of the \\"Germantown Wagon\\"; in 1780 he built a carriage for George Washington. His estate consisted of in Germantown, and was eventually split up by his heirs. Today, near the current historic site, \\"Bringhurst Street\\" is a street named after him which lies on the edge of his former land. Lieutenant Colonel John Bird was \\"lying sick\\" in the Bringhurst House when the American army attacked on the morning of October 4, 1777. Bird arose from bed to lead his men, but was mortally wounded in the battle. Although a surgeon tried to treat him in Melchoir Meng's house situated on what is now a part of Vernon Park, he was carried back to the Bringhurst House, where he died. In 1973, the Bringhurst house was donated to the National Park Service from the Germantown Savings Bank in order to \\"assure access, light, and air for the historic structure\\". The Bringhurst property is currently in the process of conversion into an exhibition space and welcome center for the Germantown White House landscape.

The town was developed as an experimental model; a model that other northern communities could replicate as they strove for modern convenience and luxury in a northern environment. The community is located approximately 1,000 km north of Winnipeg along the Churchill River. The original (urban) community of Leaf Rapids is located at on Manitoba Provincial Road 391, although most of the large official Town created later lies east of this community. This town is as large as a typical Rural Municipality in the more southern parts of Manitoba. An all-weather road connects the community to Thompson, Lynn Lake, and South Indian Lake. Since the establishment of the community, Leaf Rapids has witnessed a number of significant changes directly related to mining operations. Population declines, service provision declines, and a changing employment have all occurred since the mine's closure in 2002. The community have invested considerable time and effort examining possible transitions. History In 1969, Sherritt Gordon Mines discovered a vast copper and zinc ore body at Ruttan Lake. As a result of this substantial discovery, there was an urgent demand for a community to provide support services for the mine and its workers. The first residents of Leaf Rapids arrived in 1971Dobbie, D. (1976). Leaf Rapids is coming of age. North of the 53rd. Thompson, MB: United Steelworkers of America. and the community's infrastructure was completed in the fall of 1976. During this same year, the community's population exceeded 2,000 residents. Leaf Rapids is sometimes described as the \\"instant town\\" due to the fast construction time and the large population that gathered during the short time period. The Ruttan Mine was closed down in the summer of 2002. In March 2007 it became the first municipality in Canada to ban the use of plastic shopping bags. Planning The government of Manitoba decided that the past mistakes in the planning of northern resource communities should not be repeated, and participated directly in the planning of the community. An entirely new approach to building was conceived. In July 1970, the Leaf Rapids Development Corporation Ltd. (a Manitoba provincial crown corporation) was charged with the responsibility of building the Town of Leaf Rapids ‚Äì 25 kilometres away from Ruttan Lake. The town was constructed with a deep respect for the wilderness that is incorporated into every aspect of the community, from construction to infrastructure to recreation. In June 1971, the construction of Leaf Rapids began, ensuring that much of the natural vegetation would be saved. Even in present-day Leaf Rapids, a permit must be obtained before cutting down any trees within the town limits. The Town Centre Complex contains the following: *Leaf Rapids Education Centre *Leaf Rapids Town Offices *Leaf Rapids Consumer Cooperative *Library *Art Gallery - Currently closed. *Restaurant - Currently closed.

(September 2009) *Health Centre =Awards= Built in a semicircle of residential bays around the Town Centre Complex, Leaf Rapids won the coveted Vincent Massey Award for Urban Excellence in 1975. The Town Centre Complex was built of a material that was supposed to turn bright blue as it reacted over time to air pollution; however, in this remote part of the world, there is no air pollution, causing the Town Centre Complex to remain rust colored. During the first four years of its life, architects and town planners from across Canada and around the world ‚Äì some as far away as Japan ‚Äì visited Leaf Rapids to view its unique design and infrastructure. Over the years, other towns followed suit and today Leaf Rapids is not alone in offering modern urban convenience in the midst of a commanding wilderness ‚Äì but Leaf Rapids was the first. Transportation Leaf Rapids is located adjacent to provincial highway 391. Highway 391 connects the communities of Thompson, Lynn Lake, the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, Granville Lake, and South Indian Lake. Six kilometres north of Leaf Rapids is the Leaf Rapids Airport. As of 2007, there was no regular commercial air service at the airport. A number of small local companies provide charter passenger and cargo services. Calm Air used to fly regular passenger flights from Leaf Rapids to Thompson, however these flights have ceased since the Ruttan Mine closed. In 2007 the community again made headlines by proposing the use of golf carts for local transport.

The population as of the 2010 census was 2, down from 3 in 2000.  Geography  Georgetown is located at on the north bank of the upper Kuskokwim River in the Kilbuck-Kuskokwim mountains. It is 16 miles (26 km) downstream of Red Devil just upstream of the mouth of the George River. Georgetown is accessible by boat, snowmobile (winter), or small plane.  History  This section of the Kuskokwim river first had contact with non-Native explorers in the mid-19th century. Lt. Lavrenty Zagoskin of the Russian Imperial Navy explored the area in 1844. The village was known by its native name of Keledzhichagat at that time. It was used as a summer fish camp for residents of Kwigiumpainukamiut. In 1909, gold was discovered up the George River and a mining settlement quickly developed. This settlement was located on the bank of the Kuskokwim river just west of the mouth of the George River. The settlement and the river were named for three traders named George: George Hoffman, George Fredericks and George Morgan. By 1910, the population of Georgetown increased to about 300 with about 200 dwellings due to the mining activity. A fire swept through the town in 1911 and destroyed most of these buildings. By 1953, the only large structure that remained at the original site was the two-story log house belonging to George Fredericks. A second settlement began to develop east of the George River, and this settlement was also called Georgetown. A state school was established in 1965. As mining activity declined, residents began leaving and the school was closed in 1970. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act provided an opportunity for the town's descendants to take ownership of the land, and the Native Village of Georgetown was established in 1971. As of 1 June 2009, the Georgetown Tribal Council had 128 members, and most surviving original members and their descendants still live in the vicinity. Demographics Georgetown first appeared on the 1980 U.S. Census as an unincorporated native village. It was given the designation of Alaskan Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA) in 1990, although it reported no residents that census. It has reported 3 residents in 2000 and 2 in 2010.

Life Williams was the son of a Welsh Chancery barrister who spent much of his time in London. The Williams family had a home, Cwmcynfelin, in Llangorwen, Cardiganshire, from which Isaac would walk to Oxford and other destinations. He is associated with the establishment there of a distinct parish separated from that of Llanbadarn Fawr He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Oxford, where as an undergraduate he gained the Latin verse prize and thus came to the notice of John Keble. In 1829 he was ordained as curate of Windrush, a Gloucestershire village not far from John Keble's home at Fairford. He then returned to Oxford to assist John Henry Newman, a leading member of the Tractarians, as his curate at St Mary's Church, Oxford. In spite of a poor degree he was elected as a fellow and tutor at his Oxford college. In 1936, he served as curate of the chapel at Littlemore. In 1841, he was suggested as John Keble's successor as the Professor of Poetry at Oxford. Due to the furore raised by Newman's Tract XC, and Williams' association with the Oxford Movement, the election became a referendum on Tractarianism, the beliefs and writings of the Movement. Williams in Tract LXXX, \\"On Reserve in Communicating Religious Knowledge\\" had espoused a distinctly Catholic position. The controversy created became so heated that Williams withdrew his name and James Garbett was given the position.Chadwick, Owen, The Victorian Church, Vol 1, Oxford: Oxford, 1966. In 1842 Williams married Miss Caroline Champernowne and the couple moved to Bisley, where he worked as a curate to Thomas Keble. In 1846 he became seriously ill and, although he recovered, he was left practically incapacitated and unable to continue active work in the parish. He therefore moved to Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire, where his brother- in-law, Sir George Prevost, a fellow Tractarian, was the vicar. He lived there until his death in 1865.

Playboy magazine. Pages 41-43 (born 1969) is an American underground cartoonist. His work, which is largely self-published, deals with themes including sexuality, violence, and religion. He is the first person to receive a criminal conviction in the United States for artistic obscenity for his comic Boiled Angel. During his childhood and teen years, Diana took an interest in creating art that others found disturbing. Living in Florida as an adult, he began publishing his comics in zines, which he primarily distributed through the mail. His work came to the attention of the FBI during their investigation of serial killings in another Florida city, and they forwarded it to Diana's local police after ruling him out as a suspect. In 1992, after he sent copies of his work to an undercover police officer, Diana was charged under Florida law with obscenity. The jury found him guilty, and his sentence included supervised probation, during which any art or writings he produced were subject to unannounced, warrantless searches and seizure by the police. Two of the three counts of obscenity were upheld on appeal, and an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied. Meanwhile, Diana had moved to New York, which declined to extradite him to Florida, and he completed his probation there. Early life Mike Diana was born in 1969Comic Creator: Mike Diana.

His mother placed him in an after school art program where, for one assignment, his class was to collect seashells on the beach and incorporate them into a collage made with plaster of Paris. Diana instead incorporated the garbage and a dead fish he had found, referring to the beach pollution that was the topic of contemporary news stories. Diana later related this story during his obscenity trial to illustrate his point of view that \\"art can be ugly and convey a message.\\" In 1979, when nine-year-old Diana was in the middle of fourth grade, he and his family moved from Geneva, New York to Largo, Florida. Though Diana received barely passing or failing grades, he received A's in art classes. Amateur publishing career Diana began drawing comics in high school, influenced by macabre subject matter such as Topps Ugly stickers, Wacky Packages and Creature Feature cards. Publications that he drew inspiration from included Heavy Metal, Creepy, Eerie, Basil Wolverton's Plop!, Bernie Wrightson's run on Swamp Thing, and the work of Jack Davis. He also enjoyed underground comics from creators such as S. Clay Wilson, Greg Irons, Rory Hayes, and Jack Chick's religious tracts, which he describes as \\"sick\\". He also enjoyed visiting the Salvador Dal√≠ Museum in St. Petersburg. Though Diana enjoyed the stained glass windows in the church he attended every Sunday as a child, seeing Jesus hanging on the cross disturbed him. He eventually came to so loathe the donating of money into collection baskets following sermons that spoke of burning in Hell, his Sunday bible study class, and the denouncing of popular music among his fellow congregants that he stopped going to church by age 16. The animus he developed toward the Roman Catholic Church, along with the Jack Chick tracts, influenced Diana's depiction of anti- religious themes in his work. The conservative Florida atmosphere against which Diana chafed also influenced the graphic nature of his imagery. In 1987, during his senior year of high school his aversion to class inspired him to draw his own comics depicting unpopular teachers being graphically killed. He distributed them to his friends and submitted them to horror magazines, but was met with rejection. Diana, who lived with his father, would stay up late at night and into the morning working on his comics following working shifts at his father's convenience store in Largo. The content of his work was often characterized by nudity, violence, caricature of the human form and scatological themes, which he says he produces in order to \\"open people's eyes\\" by shocking them.Henry, Sean (November/December 1994). \\"Comic Threat\\". Mother Jones. Retrieved November 4, 2011. In 1988 Diana and his friend Robert, who was also born in New York State, bonded over their mutual dislike of the Florida climate, and after Robert got a job at a print shop, he convinced his boss to let them print at cost 960 copies of a zine on which they collaborated called HVUYIM, provided that they did the labor. Later that year Diana created another zine called Angelfuck, which was named after a song from the Misfits album Static Age, of which he published three issues. He then decided to do a digest size magazine, which he called Boiled Angel, which also depicted such horrors as cannibalism, torture, rape, and murder.Siano, Brian (July/August 1994). \\"Boxing Diana - obscenity charges against comic book author Mike Diana\\". Humanist. The first issue had a print run of 65 signed and numbered copies, and by the time he printed issue #2, demand by readers, who were mostly people in other states and those who had read write-ups in review publications like Factsheet Five, increased its print run to 300. In 1988 nineteen-year-old Diana was working as an elementary school janitor in Largo, where he would use the school's copy machine to print out the magazine.Horak, Ben (February 12, 2010). \\"The Trial Of Mike Diana\\". Schulz Library. The publication, which depicted subjects such as child rape and sodomy, bestiality, human mutilation, and drug use, was distributed to about 300 subscribers. Diana was fired by the school after some of the material that he had left there was discovered.Grant, Steven (December 19, 2007). \\"Permanent Damage\\". CBR.com. Legal troubles =Investigation= In 1991, a California law enforcement officer came into possession of one of the comics, parts of which reminded him of the then-unsolved Gainesville student murders in Florida. Copies of the books were also found in the possession of a suspect in that case, which brought the publication to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Later that year, a few days before Christmas and after Diana had sent out a few copies of the just-published Boiled Angel #6, FBI agents showed up at Diana's mother's house, which Diana was known to visit. They showed him a copy of that issue, told him that he was a suspect in the Gainesville case, and requested a blood sample for DNA analysis. The test results ruled out Diana as a suspect, so the FBI forwarded their information on Diana and his work to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office in Florida. Later, after Diana had printed Boiled Angel #7 and 8 (the final issue of that series) and a new graphic novel called Sourball Prodigy, he received a total of ten letters from a police officer named Michael Flores. Flores was posing as a fellow artist who had just moved to Largo from Fort Lauderdale and requested copies of Diana's books. Flores insisted in his letters that he was not a policeman, and despite declining to meet Diana in person, Diana obliged him with copies of his comics. In 1992 the Assistant State's Attorney, Stuart Baggish, later came across the books and sent Diana a certified letter that said he was being charged with obscenity, pursuant to Florida Statute ¬ß 847.011(1): once for publishing the material, once for distributing it, and once for advertising it. =Trial= Diana contacted the non-profit First Amendment organization the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (CBLDF), which provided him with a lawyer, Luke Lirot, and paid Diana's legal fees,\\"CCBLDF Case Files ‚Äì Florida v. Mike Diana\\". Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. January 20, 2010. which would later total $10,000. Lirot argued that Flores' letters constituted entrapment, but failed to get the case summarily dismissed, or to get the case moved to Tampa, where he and Diana felt they would get a more sympathetic jury. They went to trial the following year, in March 1994, in Pinellas County Court.\\"Mike Diana Talks to Richardson Magazine\\". Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. September 2, 2011 Baggish argued that Diana's work was obscene in a way that an easily available teen horror movie was not, because the latter \\"portrays violence in a gross way, but it does not portray sex in a patently offensive way\\", which is one of the criteria for obscenity under the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Miller v. California ruling, the other two being an appeal to the \\"average\\" prurient interest in sex, and the lack of any artistic, literary, political, or scientific value. According to Lirot, the jury was visibly disgusted by the examples of Boiled Angel that they were made to read. According to Diana, the jurors were asked \\"what their idea of art was, and one of them said 'needlepoint'.\\" Baggish also called as a witness Tampa psychologist Sidney Merin, who stated that people \\"of questionable personality strengths\\" could be aroused by the comic book. The prosecution also made a point of informing the jury that Diana had been a suspect in the Gainesville murders, despite the fact that the real killer, Danny Rolling, had been caught and pleaded guilty before the trial started, and Baggish told the jurors that if Diana weren't stopped he might become a mass murderer or turn others into killers, as Diana's comics were clearly aimed at such people. Baggish drew parallels with the Rolling case, stating, \\"This is how Danny Rolling got started. Step one, you start with the drawings. Step two, you go on to the pictures. Step three is the movies. And step number four, you're into reality. You're creating these scenes in reality.\\" Baggish would later argue after the trial that serial killer Ted Bundy had blamed pornography for his crimes. Diana testified for over three hours to explain his art to the jury, though the judge denied his request to enter into evidence a stack of his old underground comics, with which Diana wished to illustrate that he was not doing anything unprecedented. In his summary, Baggish told the jurors, \\"Pinellas County has its own identity. It doesn't have to accept what is acceptable in the bathhouses in San Francisco, and it doesn't have to accept what is acceptable in the crack alleys of New York.\\" On March 29, 1994, after a week-long trial, the jury found him guilty after deliberating for 90 minutes,Pittman, Craig (December 21, 2010). \\"Author of pedophile guide arrested on Florida obscenity charge\\". St. Petersburg Times. making Diana the first artist to be convicted of obscenity in the United States. According to Robyn Blumner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida, the comics' political and anti-establishment themes, which included its depiction of pedophile priests, crosses smeared with feces, and a drawing of two eggs frying atop a Bible with the caption \\"This is your brain on religion\\" should have protected Diana from an obscenity conviction under the First Amendment, but instead inflamed the jury toward a conviction. Pointing to the prosecution's allusions to serial murder, Diana opined that he was railroaded. Diana further likened Largo to a \\"police state\\", saying that the police had the fire department evict his family from their house with only one week's notice, and bulldozed it. =Sentencing= Judge Walter Fullerton ordered Diana held in jail for four days until sentencing without bail, which drew criticism from publications such as St. Petersburg Times and Mother Jones magazine, with the latter's Sean Henry stating that while this was the norm for murderers and drug lords, it is not so for those convicted of misdemeanors. Fullerton explained, \\"I felt incarceration in jail was part of the sentence, so why not begin? He learned some good lessons.\\" Though Baggish recommended Diana be incarcerated for two years, Fullerton sentenced Diana to three years of supervised probation, a $3,000 fine ($1,000 for each count), 1,248 hours of community service, and ordered him to avoid contact with minors. Fullerton also ordered Diana to follow a state-supervised psychiatric evaluation at his own expense, to take an ethics-in-journalism class, and ruled that he was to submit to unannounced, warrantless searches of his personal papers by the police and deputized probation officers from the Salvation Army, which would allow them to seize any drawings or writings. Although such random searches during probation are typical only in drug and weapons cases, Baggish stated that it was natural to extend this for obscenity convictions, saying, \\"Treatment is the most important part of the sentence\\", and that such searches were needed to force Diana \\"to refrain in a rehabilitative vein from this conduct. To cure the psychological maladjustment, [it's necessary] to catch him in his true state.\\" Aspects of this sentence drew critical reaction from the civil liberties community.Tallmer, Jerry (July 6, 2005). \\"Illegal comic book inspires play\\". The Villager. Blummer was surprised by these provisions, saying, \\"I don't know of any time when such monitoring has been used on an artist. It reminds you of mind control. The fact that the state doesn't like Michael Diana's attitude and will send him to experts and conduct searches is like legalized lobotomy.\\" Susan Alston of the CBLDF branch in Northampton, Massachusetts argued, \\"There have been about half-a-dozen comic book obscenity cases in the United States, but most involved store owners--and nobody was ever ordered to stop drawing. Diana is definitely the first artist who's been banned as part of his sentence.\\" Richard Wilson, a national officer of the First Amendment Lawyers Association, called the sentence \\"absolutely illegal\\", saying that it amounted to unconstitutional prior restraint. Noted comics creators also were outraged. Comics writer and novelist Neil Gaiman spoke out in support of Diana, and writer and theorist Scott McCloud called the inspection and seizure of Diana's personal drawings \\"sheer lunacy\\".McCloud, Scott (2000), Reinventing Comics. Paradox Press. p. 91, Writer Peter David characterized the sentence as \\"onerous\\".David, Peter (July 11, 1997). \\"1997 Heroes Convention\\". \\"But I Digress...\\", Comics Buyer's Guide #1234.

Retrieved June 28, 2012. =Probation, appeals and other legal troubles= Despite his and others' reaction to the sentence and Diana's bitterness toward those who targeted him, he says his probation officer, who followed his trial, was generally sympathetic and wished only to help him through his probation. During that time, Diana took up painting, and he produced one for Wired magazine that depicted himself as a tiny figure in the courtroom and the judge and prosecutors as monsters surrounding him, which he jokingly suggested violated his probation. Following his sentencing, Diana consulted with a psychiatrist who told him she charged $100 an hour for his exam, which she said would take three hours. Upon conclusion of the exam, which involved an interview, an examination of his work, true/false questions, and a Rorschach test, she charged him $1,300, informing him that she had spent 10 hours reviewing his comics. Diana, who suspected her of inflating her bill because she knew the court had ordered him to pay for the exams, refused, and was never given the test results. According to the November/December 1994 Mother Jones magazine, Diana had been recently arrested in Orlando when he tried to pay for a horse-and-carriage ride with a $1 bill doctored to look like a $20 bill. His attorney stated that Diana was unaware of the forgery and charges were dropped when Diana agreed to a pretrial probation program. Two appeals to the State Appellate Court failed to have the case reversed or reheard in Florida. During the first appeal process, the prosecution used evidence gathered after the original trial, a move that, according to the CBLDF, is usually considered unethical. On May 31, 1996, Douglas Baird upheld Diana's conviction on two of the counts, affirming the original ruling that Diana's work was \\"patently offensive\\" and that if Diana's intent was to show \\"that horrible things are happening in our society, [he] should have created a vehicle to send his message that was not obscene.\\"Spence, Kristin (October 1996). \\"Boiled Diana\\". Wired. Issue 4.10. The only count of the three that was judged incorrect was the one for advertising obscene material, because the advertisement in question was the \\"Be on the lookout for the next issue #8!\\" blurb that ran in issue #7, and the Court agreed that it was improper to convict someone for advertising material that had not yet been created since Diana could not, at the time, know the nature or character of the work. In 1996, while his case was still on appeal in Florida, Diana moved to New York City, where he was granted permission to serve out his sentence, and fulfill his community service obligation through volunteer work for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. Soon after the move, the Court refused to accept an amicus brief submitted by the ACLU, and responded without comment to the second appeal. Because Diana was no longer in their jurisdiction and New York City refused to extradite him because his convictions were for misdemeanors, they allowed him to serve his probation by mail, and took the required journalistic ethics course at New York University. Diana found another psychiatrist who charged him only $100 and concluded that he was perfectly normal, which she reported to the Florida court. He performed his community service by working about ten hours per week at Lower East Side community garden and another six hours per week at God's Love We Deliver, a group that delivers food to HIV patients. Before his probation officer quit the Salvation Army-run probation department, she told the court before that Diana had violated his probation. Still owing $2,000 in fines, a warrant was issued for his arrest in Florida. In May 1997 the CBLDF and the ACLU submitted a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court to hear Diana's case, with First Amendment attorney George Rehdart assisting in the petition. On June 27, the Court denied the petition without comment, effectively ending his legal options in his battle to overturn his conviction.Diana v. Florida, 521 U.S. 1122 (1997) In February 2020, 26 years after his sentence, Diana was removed from probation.

Personal life As of 1994, Diana was engaged to Suzy Smith, who once produced a local cable show. They both posed nude for an underground magazine. Diana has indicated that he usually does not vote, the one exception being the 1992 U.S. Presidential election, in which he voted for Ross Perot in the hopes of preventing a victory by Bill Clinton. Regarding the 2000 Presidential election, Diana says that had he voted, he would have voted for Ralph Nader. Cultural references Mike Diana's legal troubles inspired Busted Jesus Comix, a 2005 off-Broadway play written by David Johnston and directed by Gary Shrader.

It is part of the East Bay Regional Park District system, and covers in the San Leandro Hills adjacent to Oakland, San Leandro and Castro Valley. Popular activities include hiking, cycling and horseback riding. A gun range operated by the Chabot Gun Club was shut down in 2016, following complaints about pollution. The terrain of the park is often steep, consisting of grasslands, chaparral, and eucalyptus groves.  Recreational activities  The park is adjacent to Lake Chabot Regional Park, Redwood Regional Park, Dunsmuir Ridge Open Space, and the Upper San Leandro Reservoir. There are trails for hiking, horseback riding, and cycling that connect to other regional parks. Trailheads are located along Redwood Road and Skyline Boulevard in Oakland. The park houses two equestrian centers for private horse boarding and lessons: Chabot Equestrian Center and Skyline Ranch Equestrian Center. A marksmanship range was operated within the park by the non-profit Chabot Gun Club. The range closed in 2016, after operating 53 years, due to pollution caused by shell casings. Redwood Canyon Public Golf Course, a marina with rental boats, and picnic areas are located at adjacent Lake Chabot Regional Park.  Camping  View of Lake Chabot from a campsite at Anthony Chabot Family Campground Camping is a major activity in the park with a 75-campsite family campground and seven group camps. Anthony Chabot Family Campground is open year round and features 53 drive-to tent campsites, 10 walk-to tent campsites, and 12 RV/trailer campsites. Some campsites offer views overlooking Lake Chabot. The park's seven group campsites are for groups ranging in size from 11 to 300 campers. Bort Meadow Group Camp, with a capacity of 300, also allows equestrian camping.  History Anthony Chabot Regional Park opened in 1952 as Grass Valley Regional Park, originally named for the dominant geographic feature of the northern part of the park, Grass Valley. In 1965 the park was renamed in honor of Anthony Chabot, the builder of Lake Chabot and Oakland's first public water system. The lands that make up the park were originally ancestral land of the Jalquin, an Ohlone and Bay Miwok speaking tribe. The lands were divided by the Mexican land grants in the 1840s, the southern portion of the park to Rancho San Lorenzo and the northern portion to Rancho San Antonio. In the 1860s American settlers ranched the area including the 525-acre Grass Valley Ranch located in the area that is today Bort Meadow. Cattle grazing continues in Grass Valley. Extensive coast redwood logging occurred in Anthony Chabot Regional Park and neighboring Redwood Regional Park from the late 1800s to early 1900s. While all the original coast redwoods in Anthony Chabot Regional Park were logged, many regrowth trees are over 100 years old. Various water companies, predecessors to the East Bay Municipal Utility District, consolidated much of the land for watershed purposes. Beginning around 1910, the water companies were responsible for planting the large eucalyptus plantations that are still a dominant feature in the park. Some water company land was leased to ranchers in the 1900s, including the family of Manuel Maciel, an Azorean immigrant. The Maciel family (later changed to Marciel after an error in a local school record), ranched the land in the area that is now the Anthony Chabot Family Campground and marksmanship range. The main access road to these facilities is named Marciel Road in the family's honor. In the area of Big Bear Staging Area along Redwood Road was the Big Bear Tavern. While no traces remain, this was the site that began the traditional jazz revival. In 1940, Lu Watters formed the Yerba Buena Jazz Band as a way to reject big band music of the era which he viewed to be bland. Jam sessions were regularly held at the Big Bear Tavern where crowds of up to 400 could assemble on the dance floor. The tavern is memorialized by the band's song \\"Big Bear Stomp\\". A ropes course, archery range, and motorcycle park were once located at the park. On March 1, 2016, the East Bay Regional Park District Board of Directors voted unanimously to shut down the marksmanship range operated by the Chabot Gun Club. The range, which has been in operation since 1963, ceased operations on September 5, 2016.  Filmography  A service station film set was built along Redwood Road at the Big Bear Staging Area in Anthony Chabot Regional Park for a chase scene in Clint Eastwood's True Crime (1999).

A member of the Labour Party, Dromey has served as Shadow Minister for Pensions under Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer since 2018. Dromey was appointed Shadow Minister for Communities and Local Government in Ed Miliband‚Äôs shadow front bench. He became Shadow Policing Minister in 2013, but resigned from this position on 27 June 2016. On 10 October 2016, he returned to the frontbench by becoming Shadow Minister for Labour and thereafter Shadow Minister for Work and Pensions. He was previously the Deputy General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union and the Treasurer of the Labour Party.General Election 2010 Birmingham City Council He is married to Harriet Harman. Early life and career as a trade unionist Dromey was born to Irish parents in Brent and raised in Kilburn, London. He was educated at Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, Holland Park, which was a grammar school at the time. In the early 1970s, while working at the Brent Law Centre, Dromey was elected as Chairman of his branch of the Transport and General Workers Union and as a delegate to the Brent Trades Council. In 1973 he took a leading role in planning the occupation of Centre Point, along with prominent Housing and Direct Action campaigners Jim Radford and Ron Bailey. This high-profile event was designed to highlight and publicise the perceived injustice of London's most prominent (and tallest) building development ‚Äì which included a number of luxury flats ‚Äì remaining empty year after year while tens of thousands of people languished on housing waiting lists across the capital. The event was postponed in 1973 but eventually carried out successfully in January the following year. Jack Dromey built a reputation as an effective speaker and organiser in the Trade Union Movement and through his involvement with Brent Trades Council and the Greater London Association of Trades Councils, who sent him as a delegate to the South East Regional Council of the Trades Union Congress. Jack Dromey attended the 1976 \\"Luanda Trial\\", aka \\"Mercenaries' Trial\\", in Luanda, Angola, as an \\"observer\\". As an officer of the local Trades Council he also had a prominent role in supporting the strike at the Grunwick film processing laboratory which lasted from 1976 to 1978. The mostly-female Asian workforce at Grunwick went on strike to demand that company boss George Ward recognise their union; instead, Ward dismissed the strikers, leading to a two-year-long confrontation involving mass picketing and some violence. The strike was ultimately unsuccessful. Dromey was appointed Deputy General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, having lost the 2003 election for General Secretary to Tony Woodley by a wide margin. Controversies =Links between NCCL and PIE= Dromey worked for executive committee of the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL; now Liberty) in the 1970s during a period when it was allied to the Paedophile Information Exchange. Dromey denied supporting PIE or its aims, stating that he in fact actively opposed the links between the two groups. =Cash for peerages= On 15 March 2006, in the Cash for Peerages scandal, Dromey spoke of not being aware ‚Äì despite his being party treasurer ‚Äì of ¬£3.5 million loaned to the Labour Party in 2005 by three persons who were subsequently nominated for life peerages (Chai Patel, Sir David Garrard, and Barry Townsley). Loans made on commercial terms, as was claimed to be the case here, are not subject to reporting requirements to the Electoral Commission. Dromey stated publicly that neither he nor Labour's elected NEC chairman Sir Jeremy Beecham had knowledge of or involvement in the loans, and that he had only become aware of them when he read about it in the newspapers. Dromey stated that he was regularly consulted about conventional bank loans. As well as announcing his own investigation, he called on the Electoral Commission to investigate the issue of political parties taking out loans from non-commercial sources. His resulting report was discussed by the NEC on 21 March 2006. =Labour Party donations scandal= Dromey was caught up in a further financial scandal in 2007, as he was responsible for party finances, which included more than ¬£630,000 in illegal donations from David Abrahams. Dromey again claimed to know nothing of the donations, with critics wondering why he had not examined the issue more closely. Harriet Harman, Dromey's wife, was also caught up in the affair, as her staff had solicited and accepted illegal donations totalling ¬£5,000. As a result of this incident, Mark McDonald challenged Dromey for the position at re-election, arguing that more transparency was needed: he was unsuccessful in his challenge. Parliamentary career Dromey (right) with Frank Sharry at Chatham House in 2011 Dromey first sought to stand for Labour at the 1997 general election, though he failed to make the shortlist for the Pontefract and Castleford constituency. Dromey again sought a safe seat in 2007, when there were plans for a general election to be called. Peter Watt, the then Labour General Secretary, later revealed that the trade union Unite had given ¬£1 million in donations on the assumption of the nomination for the safe seat of Wolverhampton North East being given to Dromey.Union gift sparks 'cash for seats' row , The Sunday Times, 27 September 2009 In August 2009, it was revealed that senior Labour figures thought Dromey was likely to be selected in the Leyton and Wanstead constituency for the 2010 general election. The chair of Leyton and Wanstead Constituency Labour Party said he would be \\"somewhat aggrieved\\" were Dromey selected and Dromey's wife Harriet Harman had campaigned for all-women shortlists in safe seats. The party's candidates for the constituency were due to be announced in November 2009, though this was delayed for at least two months, with The Daily Telegraph alleging that the announcement was going to be made at the last possible minute so Dromey could be imposed as the candidate using emergency rules. It was revealed in January 2010 that the seat would not be subject to an all-woman shortlist, but the Constituency Labour Party subsequently selected former Hornchurch MP John Cryer as its candidate on 27 February. In February 2010, Si√¥n Simon, Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington since June 2001, announced his intention to stand down at the imminent general election. The National Executive Committee of the Labour Party swiftly announced that Birmingham Erdington would have an open shortlist. Dromey was confirmed to have made that shortlist. On 27 February 2010, it was confirmed that Dromey had been selected as the Labour Party candidate for Birmingham Erdington. He was elected on 6 May 2010. In November 2011, John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards launched an investigation into allegations that Dromey had failed to declare thousands of pounds in salary. Dromey's entry in the register of Members' interests stated he had declined his salary from Unite since entering Parliament. However, in October 2011 he changed his entry to state \\"Between the General Election and 30 October 2010, I received ¬£27,867 in salary.\\" Dromey apologised to the House of Commons on 19 January 2012, in relation to this mistake. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. Dromey retained his seat in the 2019 general election, but his majority decreased to 10%. Marriage and family Dromey married Harriet Harman in 1982 in the borough of Brent, after meeting her on the picket line of the Grunwick dispute in 1977; Harman was legal advisor to the Grunwick Strike Committee. They have two sons (born February 1983 and November 1984) and a daughter (born January 1987). Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt is godmother to one of their children.Profile: Harriet Harman, Times Online, 22 February 2009 Their son Joe Dromey is a councillor in the London borough of Lewisham. The couple decided to send their children to selective schools, the subject of negative comment at the time because it runs counter to Labour Party policy. Dromey served for ten years on the executive of the National Council for Civil Liberties, a pressure group for which Harman worked as legal officer. They have a house in Suffolk, in addition to a home in Herne Hill, south London.

Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the thalli of bryophytes and the roots of vascular land plants. Not all species have been shown to form AMs, and one, Geosiphon pyriformis, is known not to do so. Instead, it forms an endocytobiotic association with Nostoc cyanobacteria. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are dependent on land plants (Nostoc in the case of Geosiphon) for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants.  Reproduction  The Glomeromycota have generally coenocytic (occasionally sparsely septate) mycelia and reproduce asexually through blastic development of the hyphal tip to produce spores (Glomerospores) with diameters of 80‚Äì500 Œºm. In some, complex spores form within a terminal saccule. Recently it was shown that Glomus species contain 51 genes encoding all the tools necessary for meiosis. Based on these and related findings, it was suggested that Glomus species may have a cryptic sexual cycle.  Colonization  New colonization of AM fungi largely depends on the amount of inoculum present in the soil.Zangaro, Waldemar, Leila Rostirola, Vergal Souza, Priscila Almeida Alves, Bochi Lescano, Ricardo Rondina, Luiz Nogueira, and Eduardo Carrenho. \\"Root Colonization and Spore Abundance of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Distinct Successional Stages from an Atlantic Rainforest Biome in Southern Brazil.\\" Mycorrhiza 23.3 (2013): 221-33. Web. Although pre-existing hyphae and infected root fragments have been shown to successfully colonize the roots of a host, germinating spores are considered to be the key players in new host establishment. Spores are commonly dispersed by fungal and plant burrowing herbivore partners, but some air dispersal capabilities are also known. Studies have shown that spore germination is specific to particular environmental conditions such as right amount of nutrients, temperature or host availability. It has also been observed that the rate of root system colonization is directly correlated to spore density in the soil. In addition, new data also suggests that AM fungi host plants also secrete chemical factors which attract and enhance the growth of developing spore hyphae towards the root system. The necessary components for the colonization of Glomeromycota include, the host's fine root system, proper development of intracellular arbuscular structures, and a well-established external fungal mycelium. Colonization is accomplished by the interactions between germinating spore hyphae and the root hairs of the host or by development of appressoria between epidermal root cells. The process is regulated by specialized chemical signaling and by changes in gene expression of both the host and AM fungi. Intracellular hyphae extend up to the cortical cells of the root and penetrate the cell walls, but not the inner cellular membrane creating an internal invagination . The penetrating hyphae develop a highly branched structure called an arbuscule which have low functional periods before degradation and absorption by host's root cells. A fully developed arbuscular mycorrhizal structure facilitates the two-way movement of nutrients between the host and mutualistic fungal partner. The symbiotic association allows the host plant to respond better to environment stresses, and the non-photosynthetic fungi to obtain carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis.  Phylogeny  Initial studies of the Glomeromycota were based on the morphology of soil-borne sporocarps (spore clusters) found in or near colonized plant roots. Distinguishing features such as wall morphologies, size, shape, color, hyphal attachment and reaction to staining compounds allowed a phylogeny to be constructed.Wright, S.F. Management of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi. 2005. In Roots and Soil Management: Interactions between roots and the soil. Ed. Zobel, R.W., Wright, S.F. USA: American Society of Agronomy. Pp 183‚Äì197. Superficial similarities led to the initial placement of genus Glomus in the unrelated family Endogonaceae. Following broader reviews that cleared up the sporocarp confusion, the Glomeromycota were first proposed in the genera Acaulospora and Gigaspora before being accorded their own order with the three families Glomaceae (now Glomeraceae), Acaulosporaceae and Gigasporaceae. With the advent of molecular techniques this classification has undergone major revision. An analysis of small subunit (SSU) rRNA sequences indicated that they share a common ancestor with the Dikarya. Nowadays it is accepted that Glomeromycota consists of 4 orders. Several species which produce glomoid spores (i.e. spores similar to Glomus) in fact belong to other deeply divergent lineages and were placed in the orders, Paraglomerales and Archaeosporales. This new classification includes the Geosiphonaceae, which presently contains one fungus (Geosiphon pyriformis) that forms endosymbiotic associations with the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme and produces spores typical to this division, in the Archaeosporales. Work in this field is incomplete, and members of Glomus may be better suited to different genera or families. Fossil Glomeromycota are known back 2200 million years as Diskagma, and also by Mesoproterozoic Horodyskia and Ordovician to Devonian Prototaxites.  Molecular biology  The biochemical and genetic characterization of the Glomeromycota has been hindered by their biotrophic nature, which impedes laboratory culturing. This obstacle was eventually surpassed with the use of root cultures and, most recently, a method which applies sequencing of single nucleus from spores has also been developed to circumvent this challenge . The first mycorrhizal gene to be sequenced was the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA). This gene is highly conserved and commonly used in phylogenetic studies so was isolated from spores of each taxonomic group before amplification through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A metatranscriptomic survey of the Sevilleta Arid Lands found that 5.4% of the fungal rRNA reads mapped to Glomeromycota. This result was inconsistent with previous PCR-based studies of community structure in the region, suggesting that previous PCR-based studies may have underestimated Glomeromycota abundance due to amplification biases.

He was also Member of Parliament (MP) for Beverley (from 1807 to 1812) and Honiton (from 1812 to 1818). Family life Richard William Howard Vyse, born on 25 July 1784 at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire,1851 England Census HO107/1718; Folio: 579; Page: 17 was the only son of General Richard Vyse and his wife, Anne, the only surviving daughter and heiress of Field-marshal Sir George Howard. Richard William Howard Vyse assumed the additional name of Howard by royal sign-manual in September 1812 and became Richard William Howard Howard Vyse on inheriting the estates of Boughton and Pitsford in Northamptonshire through his maternal grandmother, Lucy, daughter of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672‚Äì1739).Dictionary of National Biography states that her father the 2nd Earl of Strafford was Thomas Wentworth. He was the first Earl of the second creation; the mistake probably comes from a misinterpretation to the reference to her that states she is the 2d(aughter) Earl of Strafford. He married, 13 November 1810 Frances,Abstract of the marriage settlement of Richard William Howard-Vyse and Frances Hesketh [no ref. 24 October 1810 at Centre for Buckinghamshire Studies] second daughter of Henry Hesketh of Newton, Cheshire. By her he had eight sons and two daughters; among his children were Lt Frederick Howard Vyse RN and Windsor MP Richard Howard-Vyse. Vyse died at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, on 8 June 1853. His will was proved on 13 August 1853PROB 11/2177 Will of Richard William Howard Howard Vyse, Major General in Her Majesty's Army of Stoke Place , Buckinghamshire at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. Military career Howard Vyse was commissioned as cornet into the 1st Dragoons in 1800. He transferred to the 15th Light Dragoons as a Lieutenant in 1801 and was promoted Captain in 1802 and Major in 1813. In 1815 he transferred to the 87th Foot and in 1816 to the 2nd Life Guards, and then also to the 1st West India in 1819. He was promoted brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in 1825, later nominated to rank put onto half-pay in 1825, Colonel in 1837, and Major-General in 1846. In 1809 he acted as aide-de-camp to his father on the staff of the Yorkshire district, and on 5 July 1810 received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from Oxford University. On 2 October 1840, Vyse undertook an official duty as the Colonel of the Life Guards in the mourning party for HRH Princess Augusta Sophia, to whom he had dedicated his book, Operations carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837. Parliamentary career Vyse was elected to Parliament for Beverley in Yorkshire, a borough whose elections were frequently contested, in 1807. Two months after the election Philip Staple, the losing candidate, petitioned Parliament, accusing Vyse (along with the other winning candidate, John Wharton) of bribery and corruption during the election campaign.Great Britain House of Commons, Journals of the House of Commons Vol. 62, 10 July 1807, p.680 The Select Committee to which the petition was referred declined to void the result of the election in Staple's favour.The Parliamentary Representation of the Six Northern Counties of England, William Wardell Bean Some sixteen years after Vyse's death, evidence surfaced that most of his voters had been paid: ¬£3.8s for a plumper and ¬£1.14s for a split vote.Great Britain House of Commons, Commissioners Report: Elections Beverley, vol. 18, p.393 Payments made after an election (as these were) were not deemed bribery under the 1729 Bribery Act (and relevant case law) and were not considered by Parliamentary Select Committees to be grounds for voiding an election. In October 1812, Vyse exchanged his seat at Beverley for Honiton in Devonshire.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790‚Äì1820, ed. R. G. Thorne, 1986 On this occasion Vyse was elected unopposed as the potential third candidate, Samuel Colleton Graves, of Hembury Fort, near Honiton, invited to stand, chose instead to stand elsewhere. Vyse held this seat until the dissolution of Parliament in 1818. He also served as High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1830. Egyptologist =Pyramids of Giza= Vyse first visited Egypt in 1835 and in 1836 joined the excavations of Giovanni Battista Caviglia at Giza. Vyse found Caviglia \\"unproductive\\" and in 1837 teamed with engineer John Shae Perring in an effort to explore and document the pyramids. Their work culminated in the publishing of the Pyramids of Gizeh and the Operations carried on at the pyramids of Gizeh which the latter also includes an appendix of Vyse's account of travelling to Lower Egypt.Mark Lehner, The Complete Pyramids, 1997, pp. 50‚Äì53 Vyse's \\"gunpowder archaeology\\" made one highly notable discovery in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Giovanni Battista Caviglia had blasted on the south side of the stress- relieving chamber (Davison's Chamber) on top of the King's Chamber, a chamber discovered by Nathaniel Davison in 1765, hoping to find a link to the southern air channel. But while Caviglia gave up, Vyse suspected that there was another chamber on top of Davison's Chamber, since he could insert a reed \\"for about two feet\\" upwards through a crack into a cavity.Vyse, H. (1840) Operations Carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837: With an Account of a Voyage into Upper Egypt, and an Appendix. Vol I. London: James Fraser, Regent Street. He therefore blasted straight up on the northern side, over three and a half months, finding four additional chambers. Vyse named these chambers after important friends and colleagues; Wellington's Chamber (Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), Nelson's Chamber (Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson), Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber (Anne Fitzgerald, wife of Sir Robert Keith Arbuthnot, 2nd Baronet) and Campbell's Chamber (Patrick Campbell, the British agent and Consul General in Egypt).Lehner, op. cit., p. 53 Vyse's version of events with regards to the discovery of Wellington's Chamber was contested by Caviglia in a series of letters in which the Italian claimed he had informed Vyse of his suspicion that there was likely another chamber directly above Davison's Chamber. According to Caviglia Vyse then betrayed his confidence on this matter and subsequently had Caviglia removed from the Giza site in order to claim the discovery for himself.Tait's Edinburgh Magazine for 1837, Vol IV, pp.706‚Äì709 In response to Caviglia's accusation, Vyse issued a strong rebuttal, dismissing Caviglia's charge.Vyse, Operations, Vol II, pp.152‚Äì176 Vyse also discovered numerous graffiti in the chambers dating from the time the pyramids were built. Along with lines, markers, and directional notations were the names of various work gangs who cut and transported the stone blocks. All of these work gang names contained a variant of the pharaoh's name i.e. Khufu, Khnum-Khuf and Medjedu, the first two of which were contained within the distinctive royal cartouche. While most of these gang names were concentrated in Lady Arbuthnot's and Campbell's Chamber, all four chambers opened by Vyse contained graffiti (or more correctly \\"quarry-marks\\" as Vyse called them). while the previously discovered Davison's Chamber contained none. The now famous instance of Pharaoh Khufu's name is found on the south ceiling towards the west end of Campbell's Chamber. The Khufu cartouche is part of a short inscription that reads ·∏™wfw ≈õmrw À§pr (\\"the gang, Companions of Khufu\\"), i.e. one of the gangs of workmen that constructed the chamber. Though the cartouche of Khufu is obscured by blocks or was cut off, this same gang name is also found several feet away on the last ceiling block. Vyse also depicts a partial Khufu cartouche on the North side of the chamber.https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/perring1839bd1/0018/image Vyse had the graffiti copied by his assistant, J. R. Hill,Vyse, Operations Vol I, p.259 and sent them to Samuel Birch, the Keeper of Antiquities at the British Museum who, at the time, was one of the very few scholars able to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. Birch was able to identify this cartouche as belonging to Suphis/Cheops as it had previously been identified by the Italian scholar, Ippolito Rosellini,Vyse, Operations, Vol I, p.280 thereby confirming Khufu's involvement with the Great Pyramid ‚Äì an association which had, until then, been reported only by Herodotus who records Khufu as the builder of the structure. Several compound cartouches of the similarly famous \\"Khnum-Khuf\\" royal name, also part of work gang graffiti, are found in Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber, with more examples of the gang name found in Nelson's Chamber and Wellington's Chamber.Vyse, Operations Vol I, p.280 & 284 Today these chambers also contain a fair amount of 19th and 20th century graffiti, most of which is concentrated in the topmost Campbell's Chamber. =Controversy= While mainstream Egyptology indeed regards Khufu as the builder and owner of the Great Pyramid of Giza, author Zecharia Sitchin in two of his books, The Stairway to Heaven (1980) and Journeys to the Mythical Past (2007), accused Vyse and his assistants, Perring and Hill, of forging the various names of Khufu in these chambers, offering as the motivation for this, Vyse's \\"determination to obtain a major find as time and money were running out\\".Sitchin, Z.

K√ºlpe, who is lesser known than his German mentor, Wilhelm Wundt, revolutionized experimental psychology at his time. In his obituary, Aloys Fischer wrote that, ‚Äúundoubtedly K√ºlpe was the second founder of experimental psychology on German soil; for with every change of base he made it a requirement that an experimental laboratory should be provided.‚ÄùOgden, R. M. (1951). Oswald K√ºlpe and the W√ºrzburg school. The American Journal of Psychology, 64, 4-19. K√ºlpe studied as a doctoral student and assistant to Wundt at the University of Leipzig, though his ideas differed from Wundt as he developed his own research (Boring, 1961). K√ºlpe made significant contributions to the field of psychology, some of which are still relevant to this day, including the systematic experimental introspection, imageless thoughts, mental sets, and abstraction.  Biography  In August 1862, Oswald K√ºlpe was born in Kandau, Courland, one of the Baltic providences of Russia. However, his father, a notary, and his mother were German. Consequently, K√ºlpe‚Äôs native tongue was German. He had a brother, Alfons K√ºlpe who was a clergyman, and a sister who was a nurse. He lived a large portion of his life with his older, unmarried cousins, Ottillie and Marie K√ºlpe, at their residences in Leipzig, W√ºrzburg, Bonn, and Munich. He never married either and throughout the years he devoted an immense amount of his time to his work.Lindenfeld, D. \\"Oswald K√ºlpe and The W√ºrzburg School\\". The Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences. 1978 It was said that K√ºlpe would joke that science was his bride. He learned Russian during his training at the Gymnasium in Libau, where he graduated in 1879. He then taught history and other subjects at a boys‚Äô school for a year and a half before relocating to Leipzig. In 1881 he enrolled in the University of Leipzig. He focused his studies mostly on history, however he attended the lectures of Wilhem Wundt. In these he became familiar with the blossoming field of psychology, the area upon which his life work eventually would be focused.Ogden, R.M.\\" Oswald K√ºlpe and the W√ºrzburg School\\". The American Journal of Psychology. 1951 In between 1882 and 1883, K√ºlpe studied at the University of Berlin, where he attended the lectures of Heinrich von Treitschke, a nationalist German historian. Following his studies in Berlin, he transferred to G√∂ttingen, where he spent two years as a student of Georg Elias M√ºller, where it is said he received the idea for his doctoral dissertation. Following his time with M√ºller, he returned to Leipzig to study under Wundt as his assistant in the autumn of 1886. On 12 October 1887 K√ºlpe was awarded his PhD. He titled his thesis ‚ÄúZur Theorie der sinnlichen Gef√ºhle‚Äù, or in English, The Theory of Sensual Feeling. This is a topic that K√ºlpe was interested in over the course of his life, and especially influenced his later studies and lectures on esthetics. He then became Privatdozent at the University of Leipzig, before being promoted to a professorship extraordinarius in 1894. In October 1894, he attended W√ºrzburg as professor ordinarius, the highest obtainable rank as a professor at a German university, for both philosophy and esthetics. It was here in 1896 that K√ºlpe founded a psychological laboratory. He was able to increase the size and improve the equipment until the W√ºrzburg laboratory became the most outstanding institute of psychology in Germany aside from Leipzig. Here, he trained numerous influential psychologists including the likes of Max Wertheimer, Kaspar Ach, and Henry Watt. Following fifteen years of service at the lead of the W√ºrzburg laboratory, K√ºlpe also established first-rate psychological institutes at the University of Bonn and the University of Munich. It was his innovative experimental psychology methods and success in establishing these psychological institutes that led to K√ºlpe being referred to as the second founder of experimental psychology on German soil. Though K√ºlpe and Wundt differed on matters of principle, K√ºlpe regarded Wundt highly and published three tributes to him. In his later years, K√ºlpe began to focus less on psychological issues and more on his interests in philosophical problems such as esthetics, where it seemed his true passion lay. Just before the Christmas of 1915, K√ºlpe suffered a bout of influenza. He recovered to the point where he was able to return to his university teachings. He was, however, suffering from a heart infection, which he succumbed to on 30 December, after a few days of illness. It was said that had he lived longer, K√ºlpe likely would have accepted the request to succeed Friederich Jodl and establish a psychological laboratory at the University of Vienna as well.  Laboratory at W√ºrzburg  By 1896 K√ºlpe had founded a laboratory at the University of W√ºrzburg and remained there for fifteen years.King, D.B., Viney, W., and Woody, W. D. \\"A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context.\\" Pearson Education. 2009. pg. 262-263. He received a private endowment and he managed to make it one of the foremost psychological institutes second only to the University of Leipzig. At the W√ºrzburg school, a key area of focus was the development and formation of concepts. K√ºlpe and his students expanded the use of introspection and were the first to research thought processes using experimental methods (Watson, 1978). In doing so, they developed and improved the process of what became known as systematic experimental introspection, which was the retrospective reporting of the experiences of a subject after performing a complex task involving thinking, remembering, or judging. Abstraction experiments were especially important in distinguishing relevant features of objects for individuals in differing stages of development.Eling, P., Derckx, K., & Maes, R. \\"On the historical and conceptual background of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test\\". Brain and Cognition. 2008 Throughout his time at W√ºrzburg he acted as a devoted teacher and administrator. In fact, most of his prestige comes from his dedication to his students and the hard work he directed towards his teaching duties. Though he published many of his own personal works, K√ºlpe never penned any of the traditional W√ºrzburg papers, so it is difficult to specify his personal interpretation of the work of the school. However, in many of his personal works he often anticipated notions that were later discussed by his students. K√ºlpe managed to exert his influence on the field of psychology via his students. Max Wertheimer, the founder of Gestalt psychology was undoubtedly his most famous student. However other noteworthy students include Narzi√ü Ach and Henry Watt, both of whom worked on the concept of mental set; Robert Morris Ogden, who played a major role in introducing Gestalt psychology to the United States; and Kurt Koffka, one of the founders of the Gestalt school. Distinct from the view of Wundt, the W√ºrzburg school developed an innovational, holistic view, where the focus was on studying both act and content.Watson, R. (1978). The great psychologists (4th ed.). New York: J. B. Lippincott Company. This research established a strong foundation for the Gestalt psychologists who were to come. This research was not the only notable contributions to psychology made by the W√ºrzburg school. The emphasis on motivation, and the role that it plays in the results of thinking was stressed at the school and is still relevant today. Today, it is still a widely accepted principle that motivation is a variable that affects thinking outcomes. Another contribution from the school was the theory that the behaviour of the ‚Äòid‚Äô depended not only on the element within the thinker‚Äôs consciousness, but that there were unconscious determinants of behaviour as well. This is another notable idea born from the W√ºrzburg school that is still relevant and widely accepted in psychology today.  Imageless thought  Perhaps the most famous psychological contribution to come out of the W√ºrzburg Laboratory was related to K√ºlpe‚Äôs philosophical realism beliefs. The work focused on the idea of imageless thought, which is the belief that there is an objective significance that can be found within experiences that are not necessarily associated with specific words, symbols or signs. K√ºlpe anticipated the notion of imageless thought in his early work as evidenced in Grundriss der Psychologie. He used an experiment to demonstrate that our ability to recognize something one has seen before is unrelated to whether or not we can remember an image of it. In his demonstrative experiment he took participants into a darkened room and asked them to visualize colors as he called them out. In all situations but one participants were able to visualize the colors. The participant that was unable to visualize the colors had no cognitive deficits, which lead K√ºlpe to his conclusion that recognition is independent of remembrance K√ºlpe believed that the research on thought processes up to that point, including Wundt‚Äôs study on the associations between thoughts and images, had been incomplete. Influenced by his interest in philosophy, K√ºlpe believed that there were certain sensations, feelings, or presentations that could neither be described nor associated in the mind with an image. Once they were given the opportunity to objectively self-observe and describe what was neither sensation, feeling, nor presentation, yet was still a thought process K√ºlpe and his colleagues identified the need for new definitions and concepts aside from those that already exist. For example, K√ºlpe and his students, A.M. Mayer and J. Orth identified that following the presentation of the stimulus word ‚Äúmeter‚Äù, an indescribable conscious process occurred that led to the subject responding with the word ‚Äútrochee‚Äù. This, they proposed, indicated that Wundt was wrong in his belief that all events in the thought process have either associated or direct images. Their research, although imperfect, using the systematic experimental introspection methods that K√ºlpe and the students had developed and refined, established a foundation for imageless thought research that is still relevant and debated within the field of psychology today.Leahey, T. (1987). A history of psychology: Main currents in psychological thought (2nd ed.). Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.  Abstraction and attention  In the early 1900s K√ºlpe performed experiments on the concept of abstraction at the W√ºrzburg School. K√ºlpe defined abstraction as a process in which one focuses on certain aspects of reality while ignoring others. In one famous experiment K√ºlpe instructed participants to observe a display of numbers, letters, colors, and shapes. For example, if he told the participants beforehand to report on the numbers observed, then they were unable to describe the letters, colors, or shapes with any accuracy after the experiment. If he told participants to describe the colors, then with subsequent questioning they were unable to describe the letters, numbers, or shapes.Pratt, C. C. \\"The Stability of Aesthetic Judgments\\". The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism. 1956 The item people could describe with the highest level of accuracy was always the item they were instructed to observe. These results indicated that they subjects of the experiment would abstract the requested features, while at the same time remaining ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù to all of the other present features. K√ºlpe wrote in a letter about the conclusions from these experiments: \\"The old doctrine of an inner sense with the involved idea of a distinction between the reality of consciousness and objectivity must now have its opportune renewal in the domain of psychology. This is the principal conclusion I would draw from my experiments. In connection there with I define abstraction as the process by which the logically or psychologically effective is separated from the logically or psychologically ineffective. The effective partial contents are positively abstracted for thinking and ideation. The ineffective are those from which the abstraction is made. For our consciousness, therefore, there are abstract ideas, for psychical reality there are only concrete ideas. At the same time the old controversy between nominalism and realism approaches its solution.\\" In another letter, K√ºlpe identified a key distinction in his ideas as compared to Wundt‚Äôs ideas. K√ºlpe differentiates 'thought' from 'thinking'. Thoughts are 'contents‚Äô, he argues, whereas thinking in its various forms such as meaning, judging, and concluding can be considered acts or functions. In this case, the contents are the thoughts themselves, whereas the acts or functions are the thinking process. To K√ºlpe, function and content are different and independently variable. He proposed that the acts or functions are not analyzable in consciousness, are relatively unstable, and can only be observed and known after an event has occurred. In order to observe them, K√ºlpe‚Äôs process of systematic experimental introspection is critical. K√ºlpe believed that contents, on the other hand, are analyzable in consciousness, observable in introspection, and relatively stable. He also cautioned against speculating about what is occurring physiologically at the time of thinking. Instead, K√ºlpe encouraged the finding and improving of facts on the subject. That is, ignore the physiological processes occurring as part of the thinking process but instead introspect upon what you know has occurred. As a result of his experiment, K√ºlpe determined that visual perception is determined not only by external stimulation but also by Aufgabe, which is another word for the task or directive. Since he varied the Aufgabe (task) slightly in each session of the experiment, he was able to find a correlation between the range of attention and degree of consciousness. He found that the wider one‚Äôs span of attention, the lower one‚Äôs degree of consciousness is to any specific aspect, and vice versa. He concluded that there is a limited amount of energy driving attention and that this limitation is constant. He also concluded that the abstraction process is based on apprehension, rather than sensational differences in presentation, and that these two concepts are distinct.  Mental set  K√ºlpe and his W√ºrzburg associates also used his abstraction experiments to reject associationism as the elementary thinking method. For example, in situations where participants were asked to provide a superordinate category, or superior group within a classification system, for birds, they were more likely to respond by saying, ‚ÄòAnimal‚Äô than a specific bird such as a ‚Äòhummingbird.‚Äô As a result, K√ºlpe and the students at the W√ºrzburg laboratory concluded that behavior such as the above example could not be explained according to associationistic logic. They determined that the actual task, instead of the stimulus directs the thinking process. This mechanism became known as the mental set. Specifically the mental set refers to an innate tendency to respond a certain way. Eventually the mental set was seen as a factor that could account for a large portion of the variation in the ways that people solve problems.  Major works  Oswald K√ºlpe‚Äôs books and published works cover a variety of subject matter, which impacted his interest in psychology. Examples of his publication topics include logic, aesthetics, philosophy, and epistemology. His first major book, published in 1893, was Grundriss der Psychologie. The handbook summarized a comprehensive amount of experimental research at the time, including new research on reaction time, contributions to psychophysics, Carl Stumpf‚Äôs research into tonal fusions, and Hermann Ebbinghaus‚Äô research on memory.Murray, D. (1988). A history of Western psychology (2nd ed.). Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. He defined psychology as, ‚Äúthe facts of experience,\\" as the book concerned itself strictly with scientific fact. The lack of focus on the concept of thought in his book is interesting because the W√ºrzburg school greatly researched mental set and imageless thought.Fraisse, P, Piaget, J, & Reuchlin, M. (1963). Experimental psychology: its scope and method. New York: Basic Books. He once wrote to a colleague, however, that the concepts behind the book were, ‚Äúthe source of the investigations in the psychology of thinking.‚Äù So, he had anticipated the idea of imageless thought in this publication. K√ºlpe was still under the shadow of Wundt during this time. In fact, only one of his distinctive views was included, which was his criticism of the subtractive procedure on reaction time. Two years later, Grundriss der Psychologie was translated into English by Edward Titchener under the title Outlines of Psychology.K√ºlpe, O. (1893). Outlines of psychology. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co. In 1897, K√ºlpe published a handbook called Introduction to Philosophy. This book was a guide to both past and present philosophy at the time, and a basic text for German university students of not just general philosophy, but psychology, logic, ethics, and aesthetics as well. In the book, K√ºlpe also looks at the relations of the body and the mind, and in doing so, takes a dualistic position. K√ºlpe also gives a clearly describes the relationship between physical and psychical, or in other words natural science and psychology. He identifies the possibility of what he refers to as a mind substance. He theorized that both matter and mind are abstractions from thought experience. He believed that if matter required the idea of substance, why would mind not require substance as well.K√ºlpe, O. (1897). Introduction to philosophy: Psychology, logic, ethics, aesthetics and general philosophy. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co. The book is less than 350 pages and went through seven editions and four translations, including into English by W.B. Pillsbury and Titchener under the title Introduction to Philosophy. In 1912, K√ºlpe published √úber die moderne Psychologie des Denkens, which translates into English as On the Modern Psychology of Thinking. In this book, he was looking back upon his focus on the systematic experimental introspection method. He believed that before systematic experimental introspection existed, research on thought was incomplete. He also believed that having the subject report only on sensations, feelings, and presentations in thought research was severely limiting in that it did not provide an acceptable opportunity to identify what could be considered neither sensation, feeling, nor presentation. Once they were given the opportunity to objectively self-observe and describe what was neither sensation, feeling, nor presentation, yet was still a thought process; K√ºlpe and his colleagues identified the need for new definitions and concepts aside from those that already exist.K√ºlpe, O. (1912). Vorlesungen √ºber Psychologic. √úber die moderne Psychologic des Denkens. (2nd ed.). Leipzig: Hirzel. As K√ºlpe wrote: ‚ÄúThe subjects began to speak in the language of life and assign less importance to the presentations for their inner world. They knew and thought, they judged and understood, they grasped the meaning and saw connections without receiving any real help from occasionally occurring imagery.‚Äù Die Realisierung, a three-volume text composed of K√ºlpe‚Äôs lectures, was published from 1912 through 1923. Other notable publications include the publication of a monograph, Zur Katagorienlehre, which was presented in the year of his untimely death, 1915, before the Bavarian Academy of Science. Other books by K√ºlpe include the 1912 publication of Psychologie und Medizin and Philosophie der Gegenwart.

Welsh Water Authority was privatised by stock market flotation in 1989, along with the other nine regional water authorities, which provided the company with a substantial cash surplus for some years, which it used to diversify in a wide range of sectors including leisure (Hotels, Fishing etc.). It renamed itself Hyder in 1996 after taking over a local electricity company (SWALEC) and becoming a water and electricity multi-utility. However, in 1999/2000, following the Windfall Tax on utility profits and the 1999 Ofwat price review, Hyder got into financial difficulties which led to its breakup following a takeover battle.

Civilian air-traffic controllers hired by the Djiboutian government monitor the airspace over Camp Lemonnier's runways, unlike other major US military bases. US consultants stationed at the base reported that over a three-month period, the controllers made an average of 2,378 errors per 100,000 aircraft operations, an error rate reportedly 1,700 times greater than the US standard. US federal aviation experts suggested that an unprofessional attitude on the part of the controllers potentially imperiled American military and civilian flights to and from the airport. FAA officials asserted that the controllers' lax attitude, which allegedly included barring drones from taking off or landing, stemmed from a belief on their part that the US drones were unreliable aircraft and dangerous weapons aimed at killing Muslims. The Djibouti government dismissed the air controller safety allegations as exaggerations or fabrications. US Ambassador to Djibouti Tom Kelly likewise indicated that, after asking for further improvements in aviation, progress was being registered at the airport. U.S. Navy Captain Kevin Bertelsen, the commanding officer at Camp Lemonnier, described work at the air base as challenging, but similarly indicated that conditions there had been ameliorated. In 2014, the US government also signed a new twenty-year lease with the Djibouti authorities to maintain its military base at the airport.

It converts the planning problem instance into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is then solved using a method for establishing satisfiability such as the DPLL algorithm or WalkSAT. Given a problem instance in planning, with a given initial state, a given set of actions, a goal, and a horizon length, a formula is generated so that the formula is satisfiable if and only if there is a plan with the given horizon length. This is similar to simulation of Turing machines with the satisfiability problem in the proof of Cook's theorem. A plan can be found by testing the satisfiability of the formulas for different horizon lengths. The simplest way of doing this is to go through horizon lengths sequentially, 0, 1, 2, and so on.

She was a Quaker turned Congregationalist who wrote numerous books, mostly about women's roles in society. She argued that it was the religious duty of women, as daughters, wives, and mothers, to provide the influence for good that would improve society.Women in the Literary Marketplace 1800-1900 . Early life Sarah Stickney had been brought up a Quaker, but latterly chose to be an Independent or Congregationalist, as did many of those involved in the London Missionary Society. She shared her future husband's love of books and of writing. Already a published writer (Pictures of Private Life and The Poetry of Life), she was also a contributor to The Christian Keepsake and Missionary Annual edited by the widower Rev William Ellis. She and Ellis met at the home of a mutual friend, who held prominent positions in the London Missionary Society, and with whom she worked for the missionary cause and to promote their common interest in temperance. The couple married on 23 May 1837, but were unable to take a honeymoon as William's eldest daughter Mary was ill: she died in June and was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground, next to her mother. William Ellis had started to become a successful writer on the topography, history, botany and ethnography of Polynesia, since returning from the South Seas. Sarah Ellis gained her own success, primarily with books on women's role in society. Conduct books Well-known works of Sarah Ellis are The Wives of England (1843), The Women of England, The Mothers of England, The Daughters of England, and her more directly educational works such as Rawdon House and Education of the Heart: Women's Best Work. Related to her principal literary theme of moral education for women, she established Rawdon House in Hertfordshire, a school for young ladies intended to apply the principles illustrated in her books to the \\"moral training, the formation of character, and in some degree the domestic duties of young ladies.\\" Unusually for the time, the school was non-denominational and included cookery and house management in the curriculum. With few exceptions, boys and girls were educated separately in 19th-century England, and the question of how to educate women was a subject of debate. It was common for women, as well as men, to believe that the former should not be educated in the full range of subjects, but should focus on domestic skills. Elizabeth Sandford wrote for women in support of this view, whilst others such as Susanna Corder ran a novel Quaker girls' school at Abney Park instituted by the philanthropist William Allen, which dissented from convention by teaching all the latest sciences as early as the 1820s. In Education of the Heart: Women's Best Work (1869), Sarah Ellis accepted the importance of intellectual education for women alongside training in domestic duties, but stressed that as women were the earliest educators of the men who predominantly ran and decided upon education in Victorian society, women primarily needed a system of education that developed sound moral character in their offspring. Ellis aimed much of her prescriptive writing in the 1840s and 1850s at the expanding lower middle class in the suburbs. Her readers were women who might be the first in their family to employ a domestic servant, striving to adapt to an exclusively domestic role. Understandably, historians have focused on Ellis's education of these women in domestic duties along with appropriate submission to their husbands: in the famous phrase, to \\"suffer and be still.\\" However, there was another side to her writing. She insisted that women should remain single if they could not find a \\"reasonable\\" husband. She was conscious of the widespread incidence of marital disharmony in middle-class marriages as women struggled to submit to husbands whom Ellis calls, ambiguously, \\"the lords of creation\\", and she wrote of the need for wives to \\"humour\\" or manipulate their husbands in their own interests and in the interests of marital harmony. In private correspondence she spoke of tensions in her own marriage with William Ellis and of friends who had left their husbands.A.

PhD thesis, University of New Mexico, 2011. http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/engl_etds/10 Later life After 35 years of marriage, the Ellises died within a week of each other in June 1872. Being of independent mind, she was buried in the countryside near their home, whilst her husband was laid to rest in the Congregationalists' non-denominational Abney Park Cemetery on the outskirts of Victorian London.

He made important contributions to clinical education, based on his own medical practice. His De Fibra Motrice advanced the \\"solidist\\" theory that the solid parts of organs are more crucial to their good functioning than their fluids, against the traditional belief in four humors. Baglivi, however, advocated against doctors relying on any general theory rather than careful observation. He was \\"a distinguished physiological researcher fascinated by the nerves, his microscopic studies enabled him to distinguish between smooth and striated muscles and distinct kinds of fibres.\\"Roy Porter, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: a Medical History of Humanity, New York: Norton, p.228 Life Giorgio was born to Blasius Armeno and Anna de Lupis on September 8, 1668, in Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). His mother was Italian, while his father was possibly of Armenian descent His parents were respectable but poor merchants who both died in 1670, after the birth of Giorgio's younger brother Jacob (). The brothers were originally raised by their uncle and educated at Ragusa's Jesuit college. At 15, the brothers moved to Lecce in Apulia, where they took the name of his adoptive father, a wealthy physician named Pietro Angelo Baglivi. Giorgio studied successively at the universities of Salerno, Padua, and Bologna and possibly also Naples. He attended Lorenzo Bellini's lectures in Pisa and worked in hospitals in Padua and Venice (in the Republic of Venice), Florence (in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany), and Bologna (in the Papal States) and in the Dutch Republic and England from 1688 to 1692. As early as 1685, Baglivi began experimenting with animals, injecting different substances into dogs' jugular veins and examining the life cycle of tarantulas. Between 1689 and 1691, he performed many autopsies and dissected animals including lions, deer, tortoises, and snakes. He studied dura mater through observing injured men and experimenting on dogs and also investigated toxic drugs. Observing discrepancies between his research and clinical practice, he criticized doctors for following theoretical systems slavishly instead of relying more strongly on observation. (This would later be the central theme of his 1696 book On Medical Practice.) He served as an assistant to Marcello Malpighi, beginning in Bologna in 1691 and following him to Rome the next year when Malpighi was named chief personal physician (\\"archiater\\") to the pope. While serving under Malpighi, Baglivi performed experiments on the circulation of blood in frogs; he also injected various medicines into dogs' veins and spinal canals and experimented on their pneumogastric nerves. He utilized a microscope to study the structure of muscles and the brain. Following Malpighi's death in 1694, Baglivi performed his autopsy and gave an thorough description of the cerebral apoplexy that killed him. While in Rome, he befriended Bellini, Lancisi, Redi, Tozzi, and Trionfetti. In 1695, he became second physician to Pope and, in 1696, was elected professor of anatomy at the College of Sapienza. He received memberships in Rome's Academy of the Arcadians (1699) and the Tuscan Fisiocriti (1700). He continued as a personal physician to and was named the Sapienza's professor of theoretical medicine in 1701. He continued his observations by microscope as professor of theoretical medicine at the Sapienza, as well as examining the properties of saliva, bile, and blood. His lectures, demonstrations, and consultations became famed across Europe: he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in England in July 1698,. a member of the Holy Roman Empire's Academy of the Curious in 1699, and an \\"honorary member\\" (') of the French Academy. For a time he was surrounded in controversy following charges of plagiarism by Antonio Pacchioni, but Baglivi successfully defended the primacy of his own work. He died in Rome on June 15, 1707. Works Baglivi's writings bear strong similarities to Santorio Santorio and defend biomechanicism, making him one of the iatrophysicists. Being inclined towards mathematics and quantification in medicine, Baglivi viewed the physiological processes in mechanical terms, behaving like the parts of a machine. A collection of his Latin writings were published in quarto in 1704. Subsequently, his collected works were reprinted in more than 20 editions (including an octavo edition in 1788) and were translated into Italian, French, German, and English. His personal correspondence in Latin and Italian is held at the National Central Library in Florence, Italy; the Waller Collection at the university library in Uppsala, Sweden; and at McGill University's Osler Library in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. * De praxi medica ad priscam observandi rationem ravocanda (Rome, 1696; trans. as The Practice of Physick at London, 1704) * De fibra motrice, et morbosa, nec non de experimentis, ac morbis salivae, bilis, et sanguinis (Perugia, 1700) * Specimen quatuor libroum de fibra motrice et morbosa (Rome, 1702) * Canones de medicina solidorum ad rectum statices usum (Rome, 1704) * Opera omnia medico- practica et anatomica (Lyons, 1704; new enlarged ed., 1710; ed. by C.G.

The film stars Val Kilmer, Kate Bosworth, Dylan McDermott, Carrie Fisher, Lisa Kudrow, Josh Lucas, Christina Applegate, Tim Blake Nelson, and Janeane Garofalo. Kilmer plays the role of John Holmes, a famous pornographic film star and suspected accomplice in four grisly murders committed in a house at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Plot =John Holmes and Dawn Schiller= The girlfriend of John Holmes, Dawn Schiller, is on the streets and picked up by a holy roller after Holmes leaves Schiller in a hotel room. Schiller eventually calls Holmes to come and get her. Holmes arrives at the apartment, and they have sex and snort cocaine in the bathroom. The next morning, while in a motel room, Dawn sees a newscast that states four people were murdered at a rowhouse on Wonderland Avenue, the same one she had earlier been at with Holmes. The story eventually moves on to two city detectives investigating the crime, Sam Nico and Louis Cruz, and their contact with Holmes. Another officer, Billy Ward, intervenes in the investigation. =David Lind's story= The next major character introduced is David Lind. He hears of his friends' murders at Wonderland and soon discovers his girlfriend was there. While at the crime scene, he is picked up by Nico and Cruz. Through Lind's story (told in flashbacks), we are introduced to some of the people who partied at Wonderland. These people, known as the Wonderland Gang, included Ron Launius and his wife Susan, Billy Deverell, Lind's 22-year- old girlfriend Barbara Richardson, and Joy Miller. Ron has a fondness for antique guns and frequently shows them off. When he learns that Holmes knows notorious gangster Eddie Nash, he gives Holmes a pair of stolen antique guns to take to Nash, so that Nash can fence them and the Wonderland Gang can split the loot. (Nash had befriended Holmes because of Holmes' notoriety as the porn film phenomenon Johnny Wadd.) Holmes takes the guns to Nash, but Nash says the guns are too rare to be sold, as they would be recognized right away and everyone involved would be apprehended. Rather than return the guns to Holmes, Nash keeps them for himself. Attempting to get back in the gang's good graces, Holmes suggests robbing Nash's home. Ron Launius is reluctant to go along with the robbery at first, but after Holmes gives him a rundown of what's there, he is eager to participate. Holmes volunteers to draw them a map to plan the robbery, since he has visited Nash's house frequently. Holmes then visits Nash to buy drugs, and on the way out leaves the kitchen door unlocked to give the Wonderland gang easy access. =The robbery of Eddie Nash= The next morning, Ron Launius, Lind, and Deverell carry out the robbery, while wheel-man Tracy McCourt waits outside in a car, serving as lookout. Neither Holmes nor any of the women are present when the robbery occurs. The Wonderland Gang gains access through the unlocked kitchen door and robs Nash at gunpoint. Lind accidentally fires his gun, wounding Nash's bodyguard, Greg Diles. The gang hurls racial epithets at Nash and Diles and walks away with over one million dollars in cash, jewels, and drugs. They bring their loot back to the Wonderland apartment to divide everything up. Holmes is unhappy with the cut he is given, even though he did not take part in the robbery and he's in debt to the gang. Nash discovers Holmes was involved in the robbery, he has Holmes beaten and finds Holmes' little black book. He tells Holmes he will kill every person listed in the book, starting with Holmes' mother, if Holmes does not give up the men who robbed him. =July 1, 1981= The retaliation for the robbery is swift and fatal. On July 1, 1981, a group of Nash's henchmen (including Holmes), led by Diles, gains access to the apartment at Wonderland Avenue. Ron Launius, Deverell, Richardson, and Miller are all brutally beaten to death with striated lead pipes. Diles compels Holmes to deliver blows to Launius. Susan Launius is beaten but survives, and is questioned by Nico and Cruz in her hospital bed. She tells them (in a near comatose state) that she does not remember anything, only shadows. Lind is not present during the attacks.

It originated in the nineteenth century from different breeds of water spaniels, and took more of a setter role in hunting than that of a traditional spaniel. Following the Second World War, the breed's numbers dropped so low that the breed club decided to allow cross breeding with other breeds because of fears of the existing stock becoming overly inbred. In 1980, the breed club was merged with that of the Picardy Spaniel. History A Pont-Audemer Spaniel, photographed in 1915 The breed is alleged to have been developed in the Pont-Audemer region of France in the nineteenth century. While the exact origin of the breed isn't known, it is thought that stock from both the English Water Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniels may have played a part in the breed's original makeup. In the early 20th century, outside France, they were considered more useful as a setter than doing typical spaniel type work. The breed's numbers were never large, and so few examples existed after World War II that in 1949 the President of the Pont-Audemer breed club in France allowed for other breeds, including the Irish Water Spaniel, to cross-breed with the existing population in order to alleviate the risk of inbreeding what few Pont-Audemer Spaniels remained. However the breed's population remained low, and in 1980 at the recommendation of the Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine, the Pont- Audemer breed club was merged with that of the Picardy Spaniel. The Pont- Audermer Spaniel is recognized by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, the international kennel association. It is recognised in the United States by the United Kennel Club, in the club's Gundog Group. Other breed registries that recognize the Pont-Audemer include the Continental Kennel Club, the International Canine Kennel Club, and the American Rare Breed Association.  Description  The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is a medium-sized dog, weighing 44 to 60 pounds (20‚Äì27 kg), and standing around at the withers. It is different from most sporting dog breeds in the USA and UK in its length, and the pointed quality of the muzzle. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel's coat is curly or, at the very least, quite wavy, but smooth around the face. The most common pattern is brown and white roan but a solid brown coat is also acceptable. Both coat patterns can have red-brown ‚Äúdead leaf glints‚Äù. Black or tan markings are faults. The hair on the face is short. The topknot can take up to five years to fully develop. Most Pontos have docked tails. Tails that are left intact are usually well feathered like that of a setter, although it is not unheard of for a Ponto to have the shorthaired ‚Äúrat-tail‚Äù of an Irish Water Spaniel. Temperament Head of a Pont-Audemer Spaniel Though hardy, as well as hard- working, the breed has the typical spaniel traits of being easy to train, gentle, and affectionate. The dogs are known to have a fun-loving quality and in France are said to be le petit clown des marais (the little clown of the marshes). Pont-Audemer Spaniels are usually found in a working gundog environment, and are rarely kept as mere family pets. The dogs specialize as water dogs. At the start of the 20th century they were prized for their use in hunting wild ducks in either the water or marshy conditions. They remain used in France in various terrain, and used for hunting rabbits or pheasants. Health Alopecia has been reported in the Pont-Audemer Spaniel, appearing first between the ages of seven and eighteen months. The ears and nose areas are primarily affected. Biopsies on the affected animals showed that damage to the root sheath and clumping of pigment in hair shafts were the main reasons for the condition. Tests conducted ruled out endocrine related causes such as hyperthyroidism.

Education  Mann was president of the National Honor Society in the Newton South High School class of 1965. He earned his B.A. magna cum laude from Harvard College, his M.D. from Washington University in St. Louis (1974), and the degree of M.P.H. from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1980.  Career  Mann joined the Centers for Disease Control in 1975, staying there until 1977 when he became the State Epidemiologist for New Mexico, until 1984. He moved to Zaire in March 1984 as a founder of Project SIDA, an effort to study AIDS in Africa, after being recruited by fellow epidemiologist Joseph B. McCormick. In 1986 he founded the WHO's Global Programme for AIDS, resigning this post in 1990 to protest the lack of response from the United Nations with regard to AIDS, and the actions of the then WHO director-general Hiroshi Nakajima. In 1990, Mann founded the health and human rights organization HealthRight International (initially known as Doctors of the World-USA), to fill a void he perceived amongst the health and human rights organizations in the United States and to create a unique organization whose mission was to create sustainable programs that promote and protect health and human rights in the United States and abroad. Mann directed the launch in 1994 of the journal Health and Human Rights (journal), published by the Fran√ßois Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, which he also helped to establish. Mann was also a professor of epidemiology at Harvard's School of Public Health. Promoting health and human rights Mann was a pioneer in advocating combining public health, ethics and human rights. He theorized and actively promoted the idea that human health and human rights are integrally and inextricably connected, arguing that these fields overlap in their respective philosophies and objectives to improve health, well-being, and to prevent premature death. Mann proposed a three-pronged approach to the fundamental issue of the relationship between health and human rights. First, health is a human rights issue. Secondly (and conversely), human rights are a health issue. Human rights violations result in adverse health effects. Thirdly, linkages exist between health and human rights (a hypothesis to be rigorously tested). Literature substantiates the effects of the first two points, but Mann and colleagues proceeded to call for the validation of the third point and challenged the world to practice it. His work led to the development of the Four-Step Impact Assessment, a multi-disciplinary approach of evaluating interdependent and overlapping elements of both disciplines of human rights and Public Health. With this framework, Mann attempted to bridge a perceived gap of philosophies, correspondence and vocabulary, education and training, recruitment, and work methods between the disciplines of bioethics, jurisprudence, public health law and epidemiology. Furthermore, Mann knew that the history of \\"conflictual relationships\\" between officials of public health and civil liberties workers presented challenges to the pursuit of what he called a \\"powerful\\" confluence of health and human rights ‚Äì a positive approach. Death Mann died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 in 1998 along with his second wife, AIDS researcher Mary Lou Clements-Mann. At the time of his death, Mann was the dean of the Allegheny University School of Public Health (now Drexel University School of Public Health) in Philadelphia.

It is from Paro in a deep valley on the bank of the river Paro Chhu. With surrounding peaks as high as , it is considered one of the world's most challenging airports, and fewer than two dozen pilots are certified to land at the airport. Flights to and from Paro are allowed under visual meteorological conditions only and are restricted to daylight hours from sunrise to sunset. Paro airport was the only airport in Bhutan until 2011. Paro Airport is accessible by road, from Paro city, and from Thimphu by Paro-Thimphu road. History Airport interior, 2011 Drukair Airbus A319-115 parked at the airport terminal at Paro Airport in 2006. In 1968, the Indian Border Roads Organisation built an airstrip in the Paro valley, which was initially used for on-call helicopter operations by the Indian Armed Forces on behalf of the Royal Government of Bhutan. Bhutan's first airline, Drukair, was established by Royal Charter on 5 April 1981. Paro Airport is deep in a valley above mean sea level and is surrounded by mountains as high as . The airport was constructed with a runway in length, giving the Bhutanese government specific requirements for a choice of aircraft to be operated from Paro. They required an 18‚Äì20 seat STOL-capable aircraft with operating capabilities which included a high service ceiling, high rate of climb and high manoeuvrability. The major requirement for the aircraft was that it must be capable of flying KolkataParoKolkata, a round-trip, without refuelling, due to minimal infrastructure being available at Paro. Three aircraft types were considered after flight tests that had been conducted in India and Bhutan between 1978 and 1980; however, none was deemed suitable. In mid-1981, the Indian government set up a committee to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft. Based upon this study, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983. The exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong. Drukair inaugurated scheduled revenue flights from Paro on 11 February 1983, with Flight 101 departing Paro for Kolkata and returning the next day as Flight 102. At the time of service commencement, Paro Airport consisted of the runway, a two-room air traffic control building (with the ground floor acting as the check-in counter) and a departure lounge on the lawn. Before the establishment of the Department of Civil Aviation in January 1986, Drukair was responsible for the operation and maintenance of the airport's infrastructure. In 1990, the runway at Paro Airport was lengthened from and reinforced for heavier aircraft. A hangar was constructed for the aircraft, which was funded by the Indian government as part of the Paro Airport Development Project. On 21 November 1988, Drukair's first jet, a BAe 146-100, was delivered to Paro Airport. In 2003, Drukair was seeking a replacement for the BAe 146 and on 19 October 2004 the airline's first Airbus A319-100 arrived in Paro. Buddha Air became the first international airline to operate charters to Paro in August 2010.Buddha Air in service Bhutan Broadcasting Service, 24 August 2010. Tashi Air, Bhutan's first private airline, was started in December 2011. In 2012, it was reported that 181,659 passengers used the airport. By 2018, this number had grown to 397,599 and 6,761 flights were handled by the airport. A new parallel taxiway was constructed allowing the airport to handle up to 50 flights a day. Facilities The airport has a single asphalt runway, and there is one terminal building that was commissioned in 1999.

') or √©chevin (French) or Sch√∂ffe (German) is a municipal officer in Belgium and formerly the Netherlands. It has been replaced by the ' in the Netherlands (a municipal executive). In modern Belgium, the schepen or √©chevin is part of the municipal government. Depending on the context, it may be roughly translated as an alderman, councillor, or magistrate. Name The Dutch word schepen comes from the Old Saxon word scepino 'judge' and is related to German Sch√∂ffe 'lay magistrate'. In early Medieval Latin used in France, it was scabinus. Originally, the word referred to member of a council of \\"deciders\\" ‚Äì literally, \\"judgment finders\\" (oordeelvinders) ‚Äì that sat at a mandatory public assembly called a ding (\\"thing\\" in English). Their judgments originally required ratification by a majority of the people present. Later, mandatory attendance (dingplicht) and ratification were no longer required.  Belgium  In Flanders, a schepen is a town alderman who serves on the executive board in the municipal government. It is generally translated into English as \\"alderman\\", \\"municipal councillor\\" or \\"town councillor\\", though none of these is an exact equivalent.Van Dale Groot Woordenboek Nederlands‚ÄìEngels Historically, schepen had different functions. * From the post-Roman era until the 19th century, a schepen was a 'judgment finder' (oordeelvinders). They sat in a mandatory public assembly, the Vierschaar, often a roofless building in which 4 benches were installed along the 4 walls. Later the name of the institute of the council of Aldermen became the Schepenbank. The Schepenen legislated (made laws), ratified treaties, and acted as judges. * Modern schepen are usually translated as \\"alderman\\", but unlike Anglosphere aldermen, schepenen serve together with the burgomaster as the executive power of the municipal government and not just elected councilors. Each Flemish municipality has an elected town council. During the first meeting of a newly elected town council, council members vote by secret ballot to elect the schepenen from amongst their ranks. An absolute majority (more than half the votes) is required for a schepen to be voted in. Once elected, the schepenen serve with the mayor on an executive board charged with the day-to-day management of town and city affairs, and also continue to exercise their legislative powers as town concillors. The executive board is referred to in Dutch as the \\"college van burgemeester en schepenen\\". Schepenen are often assigned portfolio areas such as culture, education or city planning. They have several executive responsibilities relating to their portfolios and thus assist the mayor in governing the town or city. The total number of schepenen in a town depends on its population. A city like Antwerp has ten; whereas Herstappe, the smallest community in Belgium, has only two. Since a schepen is also an ordinary alderman or town councillor, he or she must be re-elected to remain in the office of schepen. Since 2006, Belgian citizenship has not been a requirement for the position.  Netherlands  In the Netherlands, schepenen have been replaced by wethouders. Historically, schepenen had administrative and judicial duties in a Dutch seigneury (heerlijkheid). When acting in an administrative capacity, a schepen was similar to an alderman or town councillor, and is usually called that in English. When acting in a judicial capacity, the schepenen were often referred to as the schepenbank. One of the functions of the schepenbank was to pass judgment on criminals, thereby functioning as a jury or magistrates' bench. In this context, they are a sort of magistrate.For example, see Simon Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches and J.L. Price, Dutch Society 1588‚Äì1713 Image of \\"schout and scheepenen van Alkemade\\" as written in a 1806 Dutch marriage document The phrase schout en schepenen appears in many legal documents prior to the Napoleonic period, including the civil register of marriages. This phrase was used in both administrative and judicial contexts. If they were acting in an administrative capacity, schout en schepenen may be expressed in English as \\"the mayor and aldermen\\" (or a similar phrase like \\"the mayor and councillors\\"). If they were acting in a judicial capacity, schout en schepenen may be expressed in English as \\"magistrate's court\\" (or a similar phrase like \\"magistrates' bench\\" or \\"aldermen's court\\"). The office of schepen was dissolved by the Napoleonic reforms at the end of the Ancien R√©gime.

History The band was formed in the winter of 2003 in Buffalo, New York. Bassist Chris Gangarossa and keyboardist Scott Molloy began focusing on creating a purely instrumental sound based on the ideas of simplicity, and dominant rhythms and textures. After the addition of guitarist Jeff Mcleod and drummer Matt Felski, Lazlo Hollyfeld quickly became one of the most recognized groups in upstate New York. The band's name is a reference to the character played by Jon Gries in the 1985 film, Real Genius. Their first album, Our Universe is Feeding, was released in 2004. In late 2005, the group released The Pacer EP, which contained rock songs with an electronic, soulful, and moody elements. The first track, \\"Everything You Know is Gone\\", is almost breakbeat rock, with its uplifting changes leading to a guitar that screams echos. The heavily electro-inflected \\"Miss Hong\\", seamlessly blends into the title track, \\"The Pacer\\". Accompanying the release of the EP, Lazlo Hollyfeld played two extended United States tours, marked by appearances at South by Southwest, and two nights at The Boom Boom Room in San Francisco with Mike Clark and Robert Walters. In November 2007, the band finished recording their third release, Elimination, an energy-packed album with a 1970s rock feel; keeping the band's instrumental and harmonious sound, but with violent, anger- driven instrumental themes. The fourth album, Desert, is a concept album released May 29, 2010. The band is recording a new album and touring.

Its common name is dwarf umbrella tree, as it appears to be a smaller version of the umbrella tree, Schefflera actinophylla. Description Flowers It is an evergreen shrub growing to 8‚Äì9 m tall, free- standing, or clinging to the trunks of other trees as an epiphyte. The leaves are palmately compound, with 7‚Äì9 leaflets, the leaflets 9‚Äì20 cm long and 4‚Äì10 cm broad (though often smaller in cultivation) with a wedge-shaped base, entire margin, and an obtuse or acute apex, sometimes emarginate. The leaves are leathery in texture, shiny green glabrous on the upper surface and somewhat lighter and matte on the underside. Young plants have smaller leaves and fewer leaflets. Each leaflet has a central rib that divides it into two halves, with between four and six ribs clearly visible up to the third order. The stipules merge with the petiole, the length of which is 12-15 cm. The flowers are produced in a 20 cm panicle of small umbels, each umbel 7‚Äì10 mm diameter with 5‚Äì10 flowers. The flowering period extends from midsummer to early autumn. The flowers are hermaphroditic, having a colour ranging from yellow to green and a double perianth radial symmetry. They are composed of an entire annular calyx, five almost fully developed sepals, a corolla with five petals 2.5 mm long, with five stamens and five or six carpels that enclose the ovary. The style is not recognizable and the stigma is established. The fruits have an almost spherical oval drupe, with a diameter of about 5 mm. Inside the endocarp contains five seeds. These fruits ripen from late summer to early winter and are initially glandular points of a colour that ranges from orange to red-violet at maturity. Cultivation and uses It is commonly grown as a houseplant, popular for its tolerance of neglect and poor growing conditions. It is also grown as a landscape plant in milder climates where frosts are not severe. Numerous cultivars have been selected for variations in leaf colour and pattern, often variegated with creamy-white to yellow edges or centres, and dwarf forms. The cultivar \\"Gold Capella\\" has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4118 The umbrella plant lends itself easily to the bonsai form and is popular as an indoor bonsai. =Poisoning= Schefflera poisoning is due to the species containing \\"sharp\\" calcium oxalate crystals that are insoluble and damage the cells and tissues of the animals ingesting them. Depending on the amount that a pet consumes, the resulting damage (swelling) of exposed tissues and digestive tract may be fatal to the animal. For their own safety, children and household pets should be kept away from consuming this plant. Due to the misuse and confusion of the common name \\"Umbrella Plant\\" or \\"Umbrella Tree\\" this species has been mistakenly included on many internet lists as \\"safe plants\\" for reptile keepers. The presence of oxalate crystals is a known issue and consumption can be regarded potentially serious as the calcium oxalate crystals can significantly damage liver and kidneys of the animals ingesting any part of this or related Schefflera species. Symptoms in pets can include: cardiac arrhythmia, diarrhea, vomiting, dilated eyes, difficulty swallowing, excessive drooling, hoarse barking, labored breathing, loss of appetite, numbness of exposed area(s), obstruction of the airway, pawing/rubbing at the face or mouth and the swelling of the tongue and lips. =Care= The plant prefers higher light if possible, but can adapt to a wide variety of light levels. As a tropical plant it likes moisture (and humidity), but avoid letting the plant sit in water after you water it. It likes to be moist but not wet so just let the soil dry out between waterings. =Aerial roots= Under the right conditions, this plant will produce aerial roots that, when they reach the ground, will convert to fully functional roots. They give the plant an unusual and interesting appearance. Three conditions must be maintained for the plant to produce them: a high growth rate, insufficient trunk roots (the plant is root bound or these roots are pruned) and constant, very high humidity.

The grid leak detector has been popular for many years with amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners who construct their own receivers. Functional overview The stage performs two functions: * Detection: The control grid and cathode operate as a diode. At small radio frequency signal (carrier) amplitudes, square-law detection takes place due to non-linear curvature of the grid current versus grid voltage characteristic.Cruft Electronics Staff, P. 705 Detection transitions at larger carrier amplitudes to large-signal detection behavior due to unilateral conduction from the cathode to grid.K. R. Sturley, Radio Receiver Design (Part I), New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1947, p. 377Cruft Electronics Staff, P. 706 * Amplification: The varying direct current (dc) voltage of the grid acts to control the plate current. The voltage of the recovered modulating signal is increased in the plate circuit, resulting in the grid leak detector producing greater audio frequency output than a diode detector, at small input signal levels. The plate current includes the radio frequency component of the received signal, which is made use of in regenerative receiver designs.  Operation  The control grid and cathode are operated as a diode while at the same time the control grid voltage exerts its usual influence on the electron stream from cathode to plate. In the circuit, a capacitor (the grid condenser) couples a radio frequency signal (the carrier) to the control grid of an electron tube.J. H. Reyner, \\"Grid Rectification. A Critical Examination of the Method\\", Experimental Wireless, vol. 1, no. 9, pp. 512-520, Jun. 1924 The capacitor also facilitates development of dc voltage on the grid. The impedance of the capacitor is small at the carrier frequency and high at the modulating frequencies.W. L. Everitt, Communication Engineering, 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937, p. 418 A resistor (the grid leak) is connected either in parallel with the capacitor or from the grid to the cathode. The resistor permits dc charge to \\"leak\\" from the capacitorJ. Scott-Taggart, p. 119 and is utilized in setting up the grid bias.J.

Terman, Radio Engineering, 1st ed., New York: McGraw-Hill, 1932, pp. 292-293 The grid current increases more during the positive excursions of the carrier voltage than it decreases during the negative excursions, due to the parabolic grid current versus grid voltage curve in this regionSignal Corps U.S. Army, The Principles Underlying Radio Communication, 2nd ed.

In this region of operation, the demodulated signal is developed in series with the dynamic grid resistance Rg, which is typically in the range of 50,000 to 250,000 ohmsF. E. Terman, \\"Some Principles of Grid-Leak Grid- Condenser Detection\\", Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Vol. 16, No. 10, Oct. 1928, pp. 1384-1397W. L. Everitt, pp. 419-420. Rg and the grid condenser along with the grid capacitance form a low pass filter that determines the audio frequency bandwidth at the grid. At carrier signal levels large enough to make conduction from cathode to grid cease during the negative excursions of the carrier, the detection action is that of a linear diode detectorCruft Electronics Staff, p. 675Landee et al., p. 7-107. Grid leak detection optimized for operation in this region is known as power grid detection or grid leak power detectionE. E. Zepler, The Technique of Radio Design, New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1943, p. 104A. A. Ghirardi, p. 499. Grid current occurs only on the positive peaks of the carrier frequency cycle. The coupling capacitor will acquire a dc charge due to the rectifying action of the cathode to grid pathW. L. Everitt, p. 421.

The dc grid voltage will vary with the modulation envelope of an amplitude modulated signalCruft Electronics Staff, p. 681. The plate current is passed through a load impedance chosen to produce the desired amplification in conjunction with the tube characteristics. In non-regenerative receivers, a capacitor of low impedance at the carrier frequency is connected from the plate to cathode to prevent amplification of the carrier frequencyK. R. Sturley, pp. 379-380.  Design  The capacitance of the grid condenser is chosen to be around ten times the grid input capacitanceF. E. Terman, 1932, p. 299 and is typically 100 to 300 picofarads (pF), with the smaller value for screen grid and pentode tubes. The resistance and electrical connection of the grid leak along with the grid current determine the grid biasJ. Scott-Taggart, p. 125. For operation of the detector at maximum sensitivity, the bias is placed near the point on the grid current versus grid voltage curve where maximum rectification effect occurs, which is the point of maximum rate of change of slope of the curveA.

Morecroft, Principles of Radio Communication, New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1921, p. 455. If a dc path is provided from the grid leak to an indirectly heated cathode or to the negative end of a directly heated cathode, negative initial velocity grid bias is produced relative to the cathode determined by the product of the grid leak resistance and the grid current. For certain directly heated cathode tubes, the optimum grid bias is at a positive voltage relative to the negative end of the cathode. For these tubes, a dc path is provided from the grid leak to the positive side of the cathode or the positive side of the \\"A\\" battery; providing a positive fixed bias voltage at the grid determined by the dc grid current and the resistance of the grid leakRCA, The RCA Radiotron Manual, Technical Series R-10, Radio Corporation of America, p. 22Signal Corps U.S. Army, p. 477. As the resistance of the grid leak is increased, the grid resistance Rg increases and the audio frequency bandwidth at the grid decreases, for a given grid condenser capacitance. For triode tubes, the dc voltage at the plate is chosen for operation of the tube at the same plate current usually used in amplifier operation and is typically less than 100 voltsRCA, The RCA Radiotron Manual, Technical Series R-10, Radio Corporation of America, pp. 22-23, 25, 33RCA Radiotron Division, New All-Metal Radio Tubes, RCA Manufacturing Co., Inc., 1935, pp. 6-7. For pentode and tetrode tubes, the screen grid voltage is chosen or made adjustable to permit the desired plate current and amplification with the chosen plate load impedanceH. A. Robinson, \\"The Operating Characteristics of Vacuum Tube Detectors\\", Part II, QST, vol. XIV, no. 9, p. 44, Sept. 1930. For grid leak power detection, the time constant of the grid leak and condenser must be shorter than the period of the highest audio frequency to be reproducedE. E. Zepler, pp. 260-261 J. H. Morecroft, p. 454. A grid leak of around 250,000 to 500,000 ohms is suitable with a condenser of 100 pF. The grid leak resistance for grid leak power detection can be determined by R=1/6.28CF where F is the highest audio frequency to be reproduced and C is the grid condenser capacitanceK.R. Sturley, pp. 371-372. A tube requiring comparatively large grid voltage for plate current cutoff is of advantage (usually a low amplification factor triode). The peak 100 percent modulated input signal voltage the grid leak detector can demodulate without excess distortion is about one half of the projected cutoff bias voltage (E_{\\\\mathrm{a}}/\\\\mu)K.R. Sturley, p. 23, corresponding to a peak unmodulated carrier voltage of about one quarter of the projected cutoff biasS. W. Amos, \\"The Mechanism of Leaky Grid Detection\\", Part II, Electronic Engineering, Sept. 1944, p. 158. For power grid detection using a directly heated cathode tube, the grid leak resistor is connected between the grid and the negative end of the filament, either directly or through the RF transformer. Effect of tube type Tetrode and pentode tubes provide significantly higher grid input impedance than triodes, resulting in less loading of the circuit providing the signal to the detectorK. R. Sturley, p. 381. Tetrode and pentode tubes also produce significantly higher audio frequency output amplitude at small carrier input signal levels (around one volt or less) in grid leak detector applications than triodesH.

Advantages  * The grid leak detector potentially offers greater economy than use of separate diode and amplifier tubes. * At small input signal levels, the circuit produces higher output amplitude than a simple diode detector. Disadvantages One potential disadvantage of the grid leak detector, primarily in non-regenerative circuits, is that of the load it can present to the preceding circuit. The radio frequency input impedance of the grid leak detector is dominated by the tube's grid input impedance, which can be on the order of 6000 ohms or less for triodes, depending on tube characteristics and signal frequency. Other disadvantages are that it can produce more distortion and is less suitable for input signal voltages over a volt or two than the plate detector or diode detectorE. E. Zepler, p. 103 H. A.

She is considered a forerunner of legal postmodern feminist theory, and was a renowned postmodernist and feminist legal scholar. Much of her work was collected in the posthumously-published book Postmodern Legal Feminism. She authored the casebook Women and the Law. On April 4, 1991, Frug was murdered on the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts near the home that she shared with her husband, Harvard Law professor Gerald Frug, and their children Stephen and Emily. The murder remains unsolved. Harvard Law Review controversy In March 1992, the Harvard Law Review published an unfinished draft article by Frug called \\"A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto,\\" which explored the legal theories on violence toward women. Some members of the Review were opposed to publishing the piece, and later, on the anniversary of her murder, parodied it in He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism, which was included in the Harvard Law Revue, an annual spoof of the Review. It was signed by \\"Mary Doe, Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law\\" and argued that Frug's theories were the concoction of paranoid feminists. Co-authors Craig Coben and Ken Fenyo later apologized in a statement, particularly to Frug's husband. They added that they did not mean to distribute the article on the anniversary of her death. The statement was signed by other members of the Review, including the then-Supreme Court editor Paul Clement. Her views were considered especially infuriating by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who railed against her audacity, and stirred up strong sentiment against her among his students. According to The New York Times: Legacy Frug's casebook, Women and the Law, is still in publication, and is now known as Mary Joe Frug's Women and the Law. Image of book cover New England Law Boston houses the \\"Professor Mary Joe Frug Women and the Law Collection\\" at its library. The Women's Law Caucus at the New England Law established the Mary Joe Frug Grant to provide \\"stipends for students at New England who devote their summers to improving the lives of women.\\" In 1994 the Mary Joe Frug Fund was launched to establish an endowed chair at New England Law in her memory. This chair would be the first of its kind in the nation and would carry on the legacy of Professor Frug by allowing visiting professors to come to the New England Law and teach women's issues in the law. Frug's murder remains unsolved. In 2019, a newly-formed cold case unit in Middlesex County, Massachusetts took up the case. References Further reading * Minow, Martha.

It can take the form of over- reporting \\"good behavior\\" or under-reporting \\"bad\\", or undesirable behavior. The tendency poses a serious problem with conducting research with self- reports. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average tendencies as well as individual differences.  Topics subject to social desirability bias  Topics where socially desirable responding (SDR) is of special concern are self-reports of abilities, personality, sexual behavior, and drug use. When confronted with the question \\"How often do you masturbate?,\\" for example, respondents may be pressured by the societal taboo against masturbation, and either under-report the frequency or avoid answering the question. Therefore, the mean rates of masturbation derived from self-report surveys are likely to be severely underestimated. When confronted with the question, \\"Do you use drugs/illicit substances?\\" the respondent may be influenced by the fact that controlled substances, including the more commonly used marijuana, are generally illegal. Respondents may feel pressured to deny any drug use or rationalize it, e.g. \\"I only smoke marijuana when my friends are around.\\" The bias can also influence reports of number of sexual partners. In fact, the bias may operate in opposite directions for different subgroups: Whereas men tend to inflate the numbers, women tend to underestimate theirs. In either case, the mean reports from both groups are likely to be distorted by social desirability bias. Other topics that are sensitive to social desirability bias include: *Self-reported personality traits will correlate strongly with social desirability bias *Personal income and earnings, often inflated when low and deflated when high *Feelings of low self-worth and/or powerlessness, often denied *Excretory functions, often approached uncomfortably, if discussed at all *Compliance with medicinal dosing schedules, often inflated *Family planning, including use of contraceptives and abortion *Religion, often either avoided or uncomfortably approached *Patriotism, either inflated or, if denied, done so with a fear of other party's judgment *Bigotry and intolerance, often denied, even if it exists within the responder *Intellectual achievements, often inflated *Physical appearance, either inflated or deflated *Acts of real or imagined physical violence, often denied *Indicators of charity or \\"benevolence,\\" often inflated *Illegal acts, often denied *Voter turnout  Individual differences in socially desirable responding  In 1953, Allen L. Edwards introduced the notion of social desirability to psychology, demonstrating the role of social desirability in the measurement of personality traits. He demonstrated that social desirability ratings of personality trait descriptions are very highly correlated with the probability that a subsequent group of people will endorse these trait self-descriptions. In his first demonstration of this pattern, the correlation between one group of college students‚Äô social desirability ratings of a set of traits and the probability that college students in a second group would endorse self-descriptions describing the same traits was so high that it could distort the meaning of the personality traits. In other words, do these self-descriptions describe personality traits or social desirability? Edwards subsequently developed the first Social Desirability Scale, a set of 39, true- false questions extracted from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), questions that judges could, with high agreement, order according to their social desirability. These items were subsequently found to be very highly correlated with a wide range of measurement scales, MMPI personality and diagnostic scales. The SDS is also highly correlated with the Beck Hopelessness Inventory. The fact that people differ in their tendency to engage in socially desirable responding (SDR) is a special concern to those measuring individual differences with self-reports. Individual differences in SDR make it difficult to distinguish those people with good traits who are responding factually from those distorting their answers in a positive direction. When SDR cannot be eliminated, researchers may resort to evaluating the tendency and then control for it. A separate SDR measure must be administered together with the primary measure (test or interview) aimed at the subject matter of the research/investigation.The key assumption is that respondents who answer in a socially desirable manner on that scale are also responding desirably to all self-reports throughout the study. In some cases the entire questionnaire package from high scoring respondents may simply be discarded. Alternatively, respondents' answers on the primary questionnaires may be statistically adjusted commensurate with their SDR tendencies. For example, this adjustment is performed automatically in the standard scoring of MMPI scales. The major concern with SDR scales is that they confound style with content. After all, people actually differ in the degree to which they possess desirable traits (e.g. nuns versus criminals). Consequently, measures of social desirability confound true differences with social-desirability bias. Standard measures of individual SDR  Until the 1990s, the most commonly used measure of socially desirable responding was the Marlowe‚ÄìCrowne Social Desirability Scale. The original version comprised 33 True-False items. A shortened version, the Strahan‚ÄìGerbasi only comprises ten items, but some have raised questions regarding the reliability of this measure. In 1991, Delroy L. Paulhus published the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR): a questionnaire designed to measure two forms of SDR.Paulhus, D.L. (1991). Measurement and control of response biases. In J.P. Robinson et al. (Eds.), Measures of personality and social psychological attitudes. San Diego: Academic Press This forty-item instrument provides separate subscales for \\"impression management,\\" the tendency to give inflated self-descriptions to an audience; and self-deceptive enhancement, the tendency to give honest but inflated self-descriptions. The commercial version of the BIDR called \\"Paulhus Deception Scales (PDS).\\"Paulhus D.L., (1998) Paulhus Deception Scales (PDS) is published by Multi-Health Systems of Toronto. Scales designed to tap response styles are available in all major languages, including ItalianRoccato M., (2003) Desiderabilit√† Sociale e Acquiescenza. Alcune Trappole delle Inchieste e dei Sondaggi. LED Edizioni Universitarie, Torino. Corbetta P., (2003) La ricerca sociale: metodologia e tecniche. Vol. I-IV. Il Mulino, Bologna. and German. Techniques to reduce social desirability bias = Anonymity and confidentiality = Anonymous survey administration, compared with in-person or phone-based administration, has been shown to elicit higher reporting of items with social desirability bias. In anonymous survey settings, the subject is assured that their responses will not be linked to them, and they are not asked to divulge sensitive information directly to a surveyor. Anonymity can be established through self-administration of paper surveys returned by envelope, mail, or ballot boxes, or self-administration of electronic survey via computer, smartphone, or tablet.McBurney D.H., (1994) Research Methods. Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, California. Audio-assisted electronic surveys have also been established for low-literacy or non-literate study subjects. Confidentiality can be established in non-anonymous settings by ensuring that only study staff are present and by maintaining data confidentiality after surveys are complete. Including assurances of data confidentiality in surveys has a mixed effect on sensitive question response; it may either increase response due to increased trust, or decrease response by increasing suspicion and concern. = Specialized questioning techniques = Several techniques have been established to reduce bias when asking questions sensitive to social desirability. Complex question techniques may reduce social desirability bias, but may also be confusing or misunderstood by respondents. Beyond specific techniques, social desirability bias may be reduced by neutral question and prompt wording.  Randomized response techniques  The randomized response technique asks a participant to respond with a fixed answer or to answer truthfully based on the outcome of a random act. For example, respondents secretly throw a coin and respond ‚Äúyes‚Äù if it comes up heads (regardless of their actual response to the question), and are instructed to respond truthfully if it comes up tails. This enables the researcher to estimate the actual prevalence of the given behavior among the study population without needing to know the true state of any one individual respondent. Research shows that the validity of the randomized response technique is limited.  Nominative and best friend techniques  The nominative technique asks a participant about the behavior of their close friends, rather than about their own behavior. Participants are asked how many close friends they know for certain have done a sensitive behavior, and how many other people they think know about that behavior. Population estimates of behaviors can be derived from the response. The similar best friend methodology asks the participant about the behavior of one best friend.  Unmatched count technique  The unmatched count technique asks respondents to indicate how many of a list of several items they have done or are true for them. Respondents are randomized to receive either a list of non-sensitive items or that same list plus the sensitive item of interest. Differences in the total number of items between the two groups indicate how many of those in the group receiving the sensitive item said yes to it.  Grouped answer method  The grouped answer method, also known as the two-card or three- card method, combines answer choices such that the sensitive response is combined with at least one non-sensitive response option.  Crosswise, triangular, and hidden sensitivity methods  These methods ask participants to select one response based on two or more questions, only one of which is sensitive. For example, a participant will be asked whether their birth year is even and whether they have performed an illegal activity; if yes to both or no to both, to select A, and if yes to one but no to the other, select B. By combining sensitive and non-sensitive questions, the participant's response to the sensitive item is masked. Research shows that the validity of the crosswise model is limited.  Bogus pipeline  Bogus pipeline techniques are those in which a participant believes that an objective test, like a lie detector, will be used along with survey response, whether or not that test or procedure is actually used.  Other response styles  \\"Extreme response style\\" (ERS) takes the form of exaggerated extremity preference, e.g. for '1' or '7' on 7-point scales. Its converse, 'moderacy bias' entails a preference for middle range (or midpoint) responses (e.g. 3‚Äì5 on 7-point scales). \\"Acquiescence\\" (ARS) is the tendency to respond to items with agreement/affirmation independent of their content (\\"yea\\"-saying). These kinds of response styles differ from social desirability bias in that they are unrelated to the question's content and may be present in both socially neutral and in socially favorable or unfavorable contexts, whereas SDR is, by definition, tied to the latter.

It is considered a part of a larger area of Louisville called The Highlands. Its boundaries are Bardstown Road, Cherokee Road, Eastern Parkway and Speed Avenue. History In 1848, merchant Isaac Everett purchased a farm from the Angereau Gray family. He built a mansion house there in 1863 and called the estate Walnut Grove. His daughter, Harriet, married John Bonnycastle, to whom he gave the estate upon his death. The couple moved into the mansion in 1868 and raised nine children. The family began subdividing land on present day Sherwood Avenue in 1872, though widespread development didn't begin until Cherokee Park was opened and a street car line moved out Bardstown Road to the area in the 1890s. The southern portion was subdivided after Mr. Bonnycastle's death and was named \\"Bonnycastle's Addition\\" in his honor. Some of the land also went to enlarge Cherokee Park. The original mansion house is still standing, now called the Everett/Bonnycastle Mansion. Most of the neighborhood was developed by 1912, but one remaining parcel was a bell-shaped tract, the site of the original mansion, which had been converted to a school. The parcel was developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a signature feature of the neighborhood. The Spring Drive mansions, recognizable by their front yards, are perched atop large hills. One of Louisville's most famous Derby parties - the Barnstable Brown Party ‚Äì is held at a home on Spring Drive. Closer to the park, along Cherokee, Casselberry and Sulgrave Roads, strict deed restrictions encouraged larger houses. While encouraging upscale housing, the original deed restrictions banned foreigners or children of foreigners from owning houses on these streets, and included such provisions as a ban on hanging laundry on Sundays. The neighborhood also has a carless pedestrian court, Edgewood Place. =Influence from Cherokee Park= The neighborhood's development was strongly influenced by its proximity to Cherokee Park. There is a relatively narrow range of architectural styles in Bonnycastle, due to the short period of time it was developed. Ten of its 15 subdivisions were built between 1890 and 1914. These portions of the neighborhood display a mix of Victorian and historical revival styles, as well as scattered Craftsman bungalows. Developed in 1928 was the tallest building in the neighborhood, the Commodore Apartment Building, which list listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Bonnycastle was 4,200 , of which 96.9% are white, 2% are Hispanic, 1% are listed as other, and 0.1% are black. College graduates are 51.7% of the population, people without a diploma or equivalent are 7%.

He was born to peasants in Valle de Santiago, Guanajuato, and ran way from home as a child to see other lands and customs of the people. At the age of 18, he joined the Ej√©rcito Trigarante to fight for the Independence of Mexico where he was promoted, and had his best performance in the defense of Tampico against an expedition eight years after the independence was consummated. In 1838, he contributed to the successful defense of Veracruz against French invaders when they attacked during the Pastry War. On May 20, 1846, he revolted against President Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga, who was a conservative trying to turn the republic into a monarchy. As a general in Jalisco, commanding an army of 500 men and six artillery pieces, he attacked the invading U.S. Army, which had arrived through the San Blas port, forcing the invaders to retreat. In 1852, he was designated governor of Jalisco, by the conservatives who supported, with Jos√© Mar√≠a Blancarte, the Hospice Plan. In November 1853 he commanded the forces that defeated William Walker and filibusters who tried to seize Baja California and Sonora to create an independent republic. One of the most notable military facts about Y√°√±ez, was the defense of Guaymas. He was designated governor of Sonora on April 19, 1854, and, on July 13 of the same year, he defended the state against an army under the command of Count Gaston Raousset-Boulbon. In that month, the state of Sonora was invaded by 400 filibusters from France, Germany and Chile, under the command of Boulbon who was trying to seize the Mexican state and found an independent country. Count Boulbon had tried to convince Y√°√±ez to give up Guaymas without resistance and, after his refusal, attacked the port on July 13. Neighboring Mexican states joined the army commanded by Ya√±ez and Boulbon was arrested and executed on August 13. President Santa Anna criticized Y√°√±ez out of apparent jealousy for his courage but, after his administration ended, Y√°√±ez was declared \\"Benefactor (Benem√©rito) of Sonora and Jalisco\\". He was later designated governor of Sinaloa and, as such, he accepted the Tacubaya Plan. Few days later he resigned, leaving Pedro Espejo as governor of Sinaloa, and traveled to Mexico City. He died, as a Minister of War and the Navy, in Mexico City. Guaymas Airport is named after him.

Ideally, the opponent will be recumbent (prone), while the practitioner centers his weight atop the opponent, either in a seated or recumbent posture. Many consider back mount to be a very dominant, perhaps even the most advantageous position in grappling. This is due to the practitioner being able to attack with strikes and submissions with the opponent having a severely limited ability to see incoming attacks and defend against them. Offense In order to prevent the opponent from escaping the back mount, the position must have stability. This is generally accomplished by utilizing the practitioner‚Äôs own legs to hook the inside of the opponent's thighs, (commonly called hooks) while holding the opponent's neck or arms to maintain chest-to-back contact. Such a position can be very difficult to escape. The opponent may attempt to roll, but the hooks and chest-to-back contact will allow the practitioner to roll with the opponent. The practitioner that has the back mount is in a very advantageous position. He can strike with punches, elbows and headbutts, or alternatively attempt a rear naked choke, various collar-chokes as well as armlocks. Defense It is nearly impossible to attack an opponent who is mounted directly behind one's back. If the opponent does not have the legs hooked or chest to back contact, it is possible to roll into the mount; although this does not improve the positioning much, it is at least possible to see and block the opponent's strikes from the mounted position. If the opponent has the legs hooked in, those hooks need to be removed, for instance by pulling them out using the arms. Once they have been removed, there is an increase in mobility, making it possible to wriggle into the mount, or try to turn and entangle a leg into a half guard. Using the arms to pull out the hooks, however, leaves one's neck open to the rear naked choke. There are effective positional methods of escaping the back mount. To remove chest to back contact, the mounted opponent can grab an attacker's wrist with two hands and move it over his head to the other side. If the mounted opponent is much larger/stronger than the mounting fighter, he may actually be able to stand up and slam his opponent into a nearby wall or fall backwards onto his back (and opponent). Doing this with enough force may knock the wind out of the dominant opponent, or at least enable one to break free. Another standard escape involves the mounted opponent touching his head to the ground to temporarily prevent against a choke while also attempting to roll into the dominant opponent's guard. Alternatively, while basing with the head on the ground, the mounted opponent can use his/her legs or arms to remove one of the hooks to make rolling into the guard easier. If the mounting opponent has their ankles crossed while holding the rear mount (similar to the positioning in closed guard), the opponent being mounted can use a Figure 4 leglock to apply a submission against the dominant fighter. This can result in a tapout or possible injury, depending on the circumstances.(see back mount escape in Okuri-Eri-Jime or ) Generally, opponents skilled in ground fighting will not cross their ankles or not cross them long enough to allow this to happen.

Biography Alan Lake was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire on 24 November 1940.Alan Lake movietome.comDonnelley, Paul (2003) Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries, Omnibus Press, , p. 221-2 He studied acting at RADA, and began to work in television roles in 1964. He is best known as the third husband of the actress Diana Dors, whom he met on the set of the 1968 television series The Inquisitors. He was initially not keen on Dors; his reaction on finding that he would be working with her was, \\"Oh no, not Madame Tits and Lips!\\", but within days, they had fallen in love and were married on 23 November 1968. Their stormy marriage produced a son, Jason David (1969-2019). The pair worked together in the early 1970s, on stage in plays such as Three Months Gone, in which Dors received her best critical reviews since Yield to the Night, and they also received an offer to appear together in a TV sitcom, Queenie's Castle.Upton, Julian (2004) Fallen Stars: Tragic Lives and Lost Careers, Critical Vision, , p. 33-9 In July 1970, Lake was involved in a pub brawl for which he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, although he was released after serving a year. His friend, the singer Leapy Lee, was sentenced to three years for stabbing the pub's relief manager. Lake was a keen horseman, and on his release from prison Dors presented him with a mare named Sapphire. In 1972, Lake was unseated when the horse ran into the bough of a tree. He broke his back, and initially it was thought he might spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. However, he was walking again within three weeks. After leaving hospital, unable to work while he recovered, and in severe pain, he began drinking heavily. Dors said of him at this time: \\"alcohol had unleashed a monster, uncontrollable and frightening\\". Lake began hallucinating and experiencing psychotic episodes, but was diverted from drinking after becoming a Roman Catholic, also convincing Dors to follow him in adopting the faith. In 1974, Dors was rushed to hospital suffering from meningitis, and Lake fainted when he was told that she might not survive the night. In 1975, within months of her illness, at the age of 43, Dors became pregnant with their second child and was advised by doctors to have an abortion, but because of her newly- adopted religion, and regret at two previous abortions, decided to go ahead with the pregnancy. She miscarried, which led Lake to return to heavy drinking. For the remainder of the 1970s, Lake's once promising acting career was reduced to appearances in low-budget comedy films and small parts in television dramas. However, in 1974, he had a significant role as a singer Jack Daniels in the Slade vehicle Slade In Flame, and also as John Merrick in the first episode of the hugely popular TV series The Sweeney. Both he and Dors attended the film premiere at the Metropole Theatre, Victoria, London, on 13 February 1975. In 1980, the pair separated for a time, although they were reconciled when Lake promised to undergo treatment for his alcoholism. Lake's acting work became less frequent in the 1980s, and Dors' health began to deteriorate. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1982, and died in May 1984. Lake immediately burnt all of Dors' clothes, and fell into a depression. On 10 October 1984, five months after Dors' death, and 16 years to the day since they had first met, he took their teenage son to the railway station, returned to his Sunningdale home, and took his own life by shooting himself in the mouth in their son's bedroom. He was 43. His roles included Herrick in the Doctor Who story Underworld; and parts in Cluff, Redcap, Sergeant Cork, The Saint, Public Eye, The Avengers, Department S, Dixon of Dock Green, The Protectors, Z-Cars, Softly, Softly: Taskforce, Crown Court, The Sweeney, Angels, Target, Hazel, Strangers, Blake's 7, Juliet Bravo, The Gentle Touch, Hart to Hart, and Bergerac. In 1969, he recorded a pop single, \\"Good Times\\"/\\"Got To Have Tenderness\\" (the former a cover of a song written by Harry Nilsson), which was released by Ember Records (EMBS 278).

As the daughter of genre and portrait painter, Thomas Musgrave Joy, she was particularly known for her art and literature. In her early life, she mainly focused on painting, drawing, and illustrating. Her artwork can be seen featured in her husband's works. However, after marriage, she became thoroughly versed in literature and history. She both wrote and designed the covers of her own books. Some of her published works include Chaucer for Children (1877), Chaucer for Schools (1881), The Art of Beauty (1878), The Art of Dress (1879), The Art of Decoration (1881), and The Art of Housekeeping (1889), Beautiful Houses (1882), A Flame of Fire (1897). The genres of her work include journalism, politics, philosophy, essays, and fiction novels. She also left many printed articles and papers in manuscript on various subjects. As one of the most brilliant and gifted women of her time, she naturally became a celebrity in literature and art.  Biography  Haweis was born in Sloane Street, Chelsea, London, in 1848, the eldest of two daughters born to Thomas Musgrave Joy, and Eliza Rohde Joy, n√©e Spratt. Her mother was a daughter of Charles Spratt, of Salisbury, descended in direct line from Bishop Spratt, also Dean of Westminster, a prominent churchman in the reigns of James II and Anne. As her grandfather was a landed proprietor, her father's family seat was Boughton Hall, Monchelsea, Yalding, Kent. A highly acclaimed painter, Thomas Musgrave Joy was commanded by the Queen to paint the Royal children in 1841. He also did several pictures for Prince Albert and his work was praised by a number of the English nobility, including the Duke of Cambridge.\\"Biographical Sketch.\\" Women's Penny Paper, 26 Jan. 1899. 19th Century UK Periodicals, http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/9BSm86.

Because as a child, she had a very sweet face, Mary served as a model for many of her father's works. However, she was more than a model; she was also his imitator. Like her father, she had a natural gift for painting. Though she did not receive any formal painting instruction, she regularly watched her father work in his studio. When she was drawing or painting, the only assistance she received was her father's guidance. Occasionally, he would survey her work and add in a few lines here and there. Since, at a very early age, she displayed a wonderful eye for color, her father sent her drawings to an exhibition when she was six or seven. Aged 18, she exhibited a painting at the Royal Academy under her maiden name Miss M. E.

As Reverend Hugh Reginald Haweis was a popular preacher, Mary Eliza Haweis accompanied her husband on preaching tours of the continent and North America. Soon her travels abroad became an annual occurrence, enabling her to visit many great art galleries in European countries such as France, Germany, and Italy. In 1885, she and her husband traveled to America, where Reverend H.R. Haweis was a lecturer at Boston and a University preacher at Harvard. Ultimately, their goal was to become acquainted with the American citizens during their stay in the United States. Mrs. Haweis' visit to the Chicago exhibition in 1893 made a lasting impression on the city, made evident by her portrait being featured afterward in the Chicago Herald.  Career and Literary Works  After her marriage, Haweis continued to paint; however, she experienced many interruptions caused by social obligations and family matters. In the early stages of her career, she produced some beautiful woodcuts for Cassell's Magazine, which her husband edited, and for Good Words. Reverend H.R. Haweis was also an author. Beginning with his book for children, Pet; or Pastimes and Penalties (1874), she began illustrating and designing the covers of his books. Over the course of her marriage, she began to shift her interests from art to literature. = Chaucer Scholarship and Illustrations = Combining a widespread interest in art, fashion, history, and literature, and to supplement the household income, she soon wrote books on subjects of interest to her. Haweis published several works on topics related to medieval and modern art design, with emphasis on viewer comprehension and utilization for improved artistic surroundings. She often reused material from one publication for another. For example, her essays on artistic houses that were first published in the magazine, The Queen, in 1880-81 were then reprinted in Beautiful Houses (1882). Some of her works in Chaucer for Schools (1881) were reused material from Chaucer for Children (1877). During her spare time, she occupied herself with antiquarian studies in connection with the work of Geoffrey Chaucer, a medieval English poet and author. She believed that Chaucer's poetic lines could be enjoyed by anyone who had \\"moderate intelligence and an ear for musical rhythm.\\" As one of his most enthusiastic students, she became a Chaucerian and popularized a number of Chaucer's stories from The Canterbury Tales and some of the shorter poems in anthologies designed for children and for adult non-scholarly readers. She not only provided modernized translations and Pre-Raphaelite illustrations of key scenes from the tales, but also included the type of critical apparatus otherwise only available in the contemporary scholarly editions published by Frederick James Furnivall, Walter W. Skeat, and Richard Morris. Her adaptations played a role in widening general access to Chaucer's poetry and in promoting the reading of Middle English verse in its original.Margaret Connolly, 'Dr Furnival and Mother like the same old books': Mary Haweis and the Experience of Reading Chaucer in the Nineteenth Century, in: Eminent Chaucerians? Early Women Scholars and the History of Reading Chaucer, ed. Richard Utz and Peter Schneck, Philologie im Netz (Supplement 4, 2009), pp. 5-20. She is also the first Chaucerian/art historian to link Chaucer's poetry to existing paintings and drawings.Braswell, Mary Flowers. \\"The Chaucer Scholarship of Mary Eliza Haweis (1852-1898).\\" The Chaucer Review, vol. 39 no. 4, 2005, pp. 402-419. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/cr.2005.0008 Usually giving her name as Mrs. H. R. Haweis, she first wrote her well-known Chaucer for Children: a Golden Key (1877) which she also illustrated herself, skillfully combining both Haweis' knowledge of art and familiarity with literature. Ostensibly, it was intended to function as a historically accurate description of medieval costume and furniture, illustrated with woodcuts and color plates (i.e.detailed chromo-lithograph drawings) whose details were drawn from medieval manuscripts. This book introduced British children to Chaucer's works and legacy. Highly appreciated by the public, the first edition sold out quickly. A reader of the book wrote to a newspaper, ‚Äò[It] Unmistakably presents the best means yet provided of introducing young pupils to the study of our first great poet.‚Äô‚ÄîScotsman.\\" In 1881, Sir John Lubbock also included the book in his list of the \\"Hundred Best Books\\" to read. Just after Mrs. Haweis' passing, a copy of the book was sent to the Queen, who acknowledged it through her secretary in the following gracious exchange: \\"I am commanded to say that it gives her Majesty great pleasure to possess the beautifully-bound copy of Chaucer for Children that you have forwarded on behalf of Mrs. Haweis. In offering you her sincere sympathy in this your very sad and heavy bereavement, the Queen desires me to say that the book acquires for her, together with the inscription that coveys it, a special interest, owing to the pathetic circumstances under with it comes.\\" The depth of Haweis's erudition in Chaucer's Beads (1884) reflects her close reading of Chaucer's text. To reveal its hidden messages, she summoned the aid of relevant scholars and manuscripts, pondered the meanings of words and expressions, and sought their origins in other languages. As a result of her work as a Chaucerian, Haweis became a very unique and highly significant figure. Also, she established herself in the male-dominated world of nineteenth-century Chaucer scholars, still perceived as an important influence in keeping Chaucer alive in the public consciousness and readily accessible in the Victorian Era. A focal point of her interest in Chaucer's canon was the Miller's Tale, upon which she wrote much exceptional work, more than any other Victorian writer; she translated and adapted it for adult males, adult females, and children; published two different explications of the story; and discussed it at length in separate articles.Braswell, Mary Flowers. ‚Äú‚ÄòA Completely Funny Story‚Äô: Mary Eliza Haweis and the ‚ÄòMiller's Tale.‚Äô‚Äù The Chaucer Review, vol. 42, no. 3, 2008, pp. 244‚Äì268. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25094400. Ultimately, she turned a taboo medieval story containing risqu√© elements into one appropriate for adolescents, managing to include morals and reminders of proper manners. She also radically changed modern views of what the proper Victorian reader's reception should be to a tale; her imagined audience for this tale is assumed by the narrator to be canny and worldly. The literary reception she received for her work in this book was positive. Her readership of the Miller's Tale, composed of male scholars, women, and children, read and laughed at it.  Domestic Decor  Motivated by her preoccupation with style and domestic order, several books on decoration, dress, and household matters followed. From 1880 she wrote essays on artistic houses, first published in the magazine The Queen, later collected in a book. Although she had servants and attended many social events, money was tight and she had to fund her lifestyle through her writing. Though Haweis was considered to be in the middle-class; she often deceived people as to her true social class with her thrifty yet elegant clothing, composed of economically procured, yet rare laces and exquisite fabrics. Her \\"rare personal beauty\\" and \\"good dressing\\" made people believe that she could afford costly material. Mary Eliza Haweis' series of publications on domestic decor: The Art of Beauty (1878), based on shorter articles she had written some years earlier for the \\"Saint Paul's Magazine,\\" The Art of Dress (1879), and The Art of Decoration (1881), demonstrated her knowledge of the broad history of fashion and expressed her views on the dangers some fashions could pose to health. Some of her views on the necessity, even duty of women appearing well led to some good-natured sarcasm directed at the volume by The Contemporary Review, which complained, \\"In a word, Mrs. Haweis will spare nothing, and not shrink from anything, which will prevent our giving one another the least personal shock; she is for using every means to make quite sure that everybody will visibly delight everybody else. It is very pleasant to think of. Certainly, there would have to be a good deal of dressing going on for this, especially in some cases, and how amidst it all we could be guarded against being upset by glimpses of one another at times before the toilettes were completed, it is not easy to see. However, Mrs. Haweis can only deal with this world as she finds it.\\"\\"Essays and Notices.\\" The Contemporary Review, Volume 31, 1878, pg. 213. Believing that decoration should be both useful and in harmony with natural proportion, she produced Rus in Urbe: Flowers that Thrive in London Gardens & Smoky Towns (1886) and The Art of Housekeeping: a Bridal Garland (1889), a practical household management guide for newly married women.  Later life  During the last ten or fifteen years of her life, Haweis lost interest in her artistic occupations; instead, she became interested in philanthropic causes and extending the Parliamentary Franchise to women, besides other social causes connected with the interests and general progress of women. For personal protection, she kept a secret revolver concealed in her purse. She joined women's clubs and circles where women's interests were discussed. Though she disliked public speaking, she became an influential public speaker, beloved by audiences. = Women's Movement and Social Causes = One of her most memorable visits was to Rome, Italy, where she met several of the leading women amongst the Roman nobility who were promoting the woman movement in Italy. She admired Queen Margherita for her care and efforts on behalf of poor working girls. Mr. and Mrs. Haweis were welcomed by the Queen personally and invited to a public ball during which Mary Eliza Haweis admired the gorgeous court pageantries and Drawing Rooms. She was in awe of and in love with all the beautiful forms and colors. In her late years, Haweis also wrote articles on husbands and wives, particularly investigating how the wife might best \\"survive\\" with a husband who guards her. Like many other women writers of the nineteenth century, she turned to journalism, adding fashion and domesticity to the subjects of science, religion, and philosophy intended for men. She wrote a lengthy piece with photographs and illustrations for the Lady's Realm in 1897 entitled \\"The Empress Frederick and Friedrichshof.\\" It was a history of Victoria, Princess Royal, the elder child of Queen Victoria and a German monarch in her own right by marriage who, in Haweis's view, \\"has left a permanent and noble mark on German history, not only by her domestic devotion, but by all she has tried to do for the elevation of her own sex.\\"\\"The Empress Frederick and Friedrichshof.\\" Lady's Realm: An Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Vol. 1, pgs. 115-126. Because of her father's portrait painting, Haweis retained early memories of the empress, reminiscing, \\"The Princess Royal was a very sweet- looking child. I remember a rough drawing of her done by my father, T.M. Joy, by for us children - a softened Georgian face in a quaint cap, and the stiff gown of some old German costume, in which Queen Victoria had commissioned him to sketch the child, I think in 1842: the original, of course, is still possessed by Her Majesty.\\" Late in her life, Haweis developed a strong addiction to occult and astrological studies, which is referenced in the article concerning the Empress Frederick, and left manuscript books full of horoscopes after her death. In line with this interest, she appears to have published an article in The Humanitarian, edited by American suffragette Victoria Woodhull Martin entitled \\"Astrology Revived\\" in July of 1896.The Athenaeum: A Journal of Literature, Science, the Fine Arts, Music, and the Drama. J. Francis, 1896, pg. 3. Her last known publication was the novel A Flame of Fire (1897), written in support of the female suffrage movement and to illustrate the helplessness of women in marriage. In this novel, her heroine Aglae Dorriforth, marries Henry Quekett, ‚Äúa worthless tyrant\\" - his subsequent ill-treatment of her roughly dispels the helpless stupor Aglae experienced during their courtship and early marriage and causes her to begin using her own intellectual powers in defense.Haweis, Mary Eliza. A Flame of Fire. London: Hurst & Blackett, 1897, pg. 174. Besides advocating for women, Haweis also sympathized with animals; she was part of the anti-vivisection campaign. She expressed her feelings and opposition verbally and in writing. Together with her husband, Mary Haweis also successfully campaigned to have museums opened on Sundays so that the working classes could benefit from the exhibits. = Health Decline = As a result of her demanding life, requiring so much of energy and brain power, Haweis' health became impaired. She was taken to Epson where she received favorable conditions; however, her health continued to decline. She continued to write as long as she could and remained interested in many causes. Reflections on her life concurred that she strove for utter perfection and accuracy in all affairs of life, apparently due to her intense activity, brightness of intellect, artistic faculty, and unusual methods. Her annotated diaries were found along with her receipts from the last thirty years, all in order. She spent the last two months of her life at Bath, completing the last of her articles in her final days.  Death and Legacy  On 24 November 1898, Mary Eliza Haweis died at Lansdown Grove House, Bath, Somerset, from kidney disease and heart failure.Ancestry.com.

In honor and memory of Mary Eliza Haweis and her unfailing courage and unwearied efforts to support the rights of women, a fund was established in her name.

Plot  Stan and Ollie are about to attend a poker game when Ollie receives a telephone call telling them their absence is holding up the game. Ollie then tells their wives they have a business engagement at the Orpheum Theater and sneak off to their poker game. En route, they gallantly stop to assist two young ladies retrieve a hat that has blown under a parked car. They end up being soaked by a passing street-cleaning vehicle while trying to retrieve it. The girls invite them up to their apartment while their clothes dry. One of the females becomes very amorous with Stan and all proceed to become blotto with beer. A large boyfriend of one of the females appears at the apartment, sending the duo scrambling out the back window, in full view of their wives who have already seen a newspaper headline announcing that the Orpheum Theater had been gutted by a fire. The rest of the story is about how the duo lie to their unimpressed wives in ever-escalating tall tales about the things they supposedly saw at the theater, before realizing the truth and being chased out by the wives.

It was the first Laurel & Hardy film directed by Leo McCarey in the director's chair after being a character development supervisor for a period. McCarey would go on to direct their best silent entries. We Faw Down was remade during the sound era as the feature-length Sons of the Desert. A contemporary account says that the basic story was contributed, unusually, by Oliver Hardy, who had heard similar gossip from his laundress.Mitchell, Glenn, (1995). The Laurel & Hardy Encyclopedia. London: Batsford, Ltd.. , p. 286. Critic/historian William K. Everson makes a different contention, tracing the story back to the Mack Sennett comedy Ambrose's First Falsehood.Everson, William K. (1967). The Films of Laurel and Hardy. Secaucus, NJ: Citadel Press. , p. 73 Interior shooting took place at the Hal Roach studio; exteriors were shot both on the Roach back lot and on several locations in Culver City. The original Victor sound discs for We Faw Down were thought lost until the 1990s, when a set was discovered. Certain European DVD editions feature this original synchronized score, but American DVDs (Region 1) still have music cannibalized from other Laurel & Hardy Victor soundtracks. As originally scripted and shot, We Faw Down features the duo fleeing the girls' apartment having pulled on each other's pants, then dart from spot to spot in town trying to find a private place to rectify the situation. An irate husband, suspicious cop and belligerent king crab all conspire to thwart the swapping of the pants.Skretvedt, Randy, (1996). Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies.

Stan Laurel would eventually reuse this plot device for 1938's Block-Heads.

There is a valley on the moon named Vallis Inghirami after him as well as a crater. Life Inghirami was born in Volterra, Tuscany, in 1779. His family produced two other distinguished scholars, Tommaso (1470‚Äì1516) (a humanist scholar), and his brother, Francesco (1772‚Äì1846), an archaeologist. Inghirami's education was received in his native city at the College of Saint Michael. He joined the religious Order of the Piarist Fathers at the age of 17, and later became professor of mathematics and philosophy at the Pious Schools of Volterra, where one of his pupils was the future Pope Pius IX. In 1805 he traveled to the north of Italy, and was engaged for some months in scientific work at Milan. He was called to Florence to fill the twofold office of professor of mathematics and astronomy at the Piarist College there. Inghirami's first publications were articles on hydraulics, statics, and astronomy, astronomical tables, and elementary text-books on mathematics and mathematical geography. In 1830 after observations extending over fourteen years, he published, with the patronage of the Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany, a \\"Carta topografica e geometica della Toscana\\" on the scale of 1:200,000. When the Berlin Academy of Sciences undertook the construction of an exhaustive astronomical atlas, Inghirami was assigned a section. His performance of this task won great praise. he became successively Provincial Superior and Superior General of his Order, but his failing health and his love for scientific work caused him to resign the latter office, which had required his taking up residence in Rome, and to accept the position of Vicar General of the Order. He returned to Florence and, although almost blind for some years, continued his teaching until a few months before his death in that city.

The neighborhood is bound by Bardstown Road, Speed Avenue, Taylorsville Road, and Cherokee Park. It is considered a part of a larger area of Louisville called The Highlands. It is often simply called Douglass. History =Pre-subdivision= The area was originally part of a estate belonging to Mississippi plantation owner Stark Fielding. It was referred to as the \\"Woodbourne Estate.\\" In 1870, the land was bought by then Western Union president George Douglass, for whom the area is named. The distinctive estate home still stands, located behind Douglass Boulevard Christian Church. The large white-columned Southern Colonial mansion was originally built by Fielding in the 1830s, and from the 1930s until 1949 was Rugby University School, an exclusive boy's preparatory school. The church has owned the house since 1949 and uses it for offices and meeting space. After George Douglass died, the land passed to his daughter. The area was subdivided and developed after the opening of Cherokee Park, to which the family donated several acres in exchange for the right to connect subdivisions to the park. Part of the Douglass donation included \\"Big Rock,\\" one of the more popular spots in the park. Another antebellum home, Rose Hill, is found on Hampden Court a short distance from Bardstown Road. The imposing two-story Italianate mansion is distinguished by its central bell tower. Rose Hill was built in 1852 for Emory Low, a Louisville dry goods merchant born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1808. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. =Neighborhood development= In 1912, a streetcar line was extended down Bardstown Road to Douglass Boulevard, where it \\"looped\\" around and went back toward downtown. Most houses in Highlands‚ÄìDouglass were built in the 1920s, as undeveloped land closer to the Original Highlands became nonexistent and the \\"outer Highlands\\" became popular. However, due to the great depression, development in the eastern portion of the neighborhood slowed greatly, and would not be completed until 1952. This stopping and starting of development explains the mixture of scattered historical revival and craftsmen houses - typical of the early 20th century - with mid-century ranch-style houses along Valletta, Moyle Hill and Millvale roads in particular. North of Douglass, in portions built in the boom years of the 1920s, the heavily upper-middle class subdivisions were stocked with houses built in Historical Revival styles. Colonial, Tudor, English and Dutch Revival styles are dominant. South of Woodbourne, homes are somewhat more modest brick and frame bungalows.

He was a first cousin of the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany Gian Gastone de' Medici; he was also of second cousin of Louis XIV and nephew of the famous La Grande Mademoiselle. He was also a double descendant of Catherine de' Medici and her husband Henry II. Upon the premature death of his father in 1671, he became Duke of Guise and Joyeuse, but was styled the Duke of Alen√ßon, in right of his mother. At the death of his maternal grandmother Marguerite of Lorraine in 1672 Francis Joseph and his mother moved into the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The last male of the senior line of the House of Guise, he was unfortunately sickly. Still unable to walk unaided at age four, he was dropped by his nurse and died from a head injury in 1675.

After shakedown off the west coast, Ramsey departed Long Beach, California, on 1 May 1968 for the western Pacific. Following duty off Vietnam and her return to Long Beach 9 November, she sailed again for the western Pacific 8 October 1969, and again operated off Vietnam, before returning to Long Beach 18 April 1970. Between January 1970 and January 1974, Ramsey alternated two more WestPac cruises with operations off the west coast of the United States. Ramsey earned five battle stars for Vietnam service. She was classified as a Destroyer, Guided Missile Escort (DEG-2) from her commissioning until after her combat tours in Vietnam. The new designation was Guided Missile (Fighting) Frigate, (FFG-2), effective 30 June 1975. She was decommissioned on 1 September 1988.

It stars Gene Wilder as the titular Quackser Fortune, a poor Irish manure collector who falls in love with an American exchange student (Margot Kidder) after she almost runs him over. Production In his autobiography, Wilder talks in detail about his experience making the movie. This includes that the original choice for director was the acclaimed Jean Renoir. Wilder described meeting with the director, who wanted to make the movie, but could not for a full year due to other commitments, so he was passed over. Wilder also spoke at length about nearly adopting one of the young Irish extras that he'd become close to (whose impoverished parents supported the idea so that the boy could have a chance at a better life). However, the boy decided to remain in Ireland, so Wilder did not adopt him. Plot In Dublin, a working-class family has been unsuccessful in convincing their son to get a real job: the son prefers his job of scooping up horse's dung and selling it for flower gardens. An American exchange student almost runs him over and gets to know him. The dung man has ignored warnings from his family and suddenly the horses have been banned from Dublin. His new love is leaving for America and he must find a way to cope with the new reality.

Their black magic includes the creation of zombies and the creation of 'ouangas', talismans that house spirits.Zombies (from 'Encyclopedia of Death and Dying' website, with added references there. Accessed 2008-06-15.)Report on Voodoo , from Self-Ascription Without Qualia: A Case-Study (PDF) ‚Äì Chalmers, David J.; Department of Philosophy, University of California, Santa Cruz The term bokor can also refer to the leader of the Makaya division of Vodou, which originated in the Congo region. Description Bokors, featured in many Haitian tales, are often associated with the creation of \\"zombies\\" by the use of a deadening brew or potion, usually containing poison extracted from puffer fish (tetrodotoxin). This potion induces the drinker to appear as though they were dead; thus he is often buried. Later, the bokor would return for the \\"corpse\\" and force it to do his bidding, such as manual labor. The \\"corpse\\" is often given deliriant drugs, mainly datura stramonium, where they enter a detached, somewhat dreamlike state. Its state is likened to being mind controlled. The person is alive but in a state where they cannot control what they say or do; at this point, when the person has been \\"reanimated\\" from the grave, or at least is moving about working for the bokor, they can be termed \\"zombies.\\" However, some legends dispense with this explanation, and have the bokor raise zombies from dead bodies whose souls have departed. Also, bokors are said to work with zombie astrals ‚Äì souls or spirits which are captured in a fetish and made to enhance the Bokor's power. Bokors normally work with the Loas Baron Samedi, Kalfu, Legba and Simbi (snake loa), and in some cases they are said to work with Grand Bois, the loa of the forest. Bokors are similar to the \\"root workers\\" of Vodou and New Orleans voodoo. Some may be priests of a Vodou house. Bokor are usually chosen from birth, those who are believed to bear a great ashe (power).

He was born in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was educated at Vanderbilt University, and later at the Art Institute of Chicago. He has created hundreds of covers and illustrations for The New Yorker, Esquire, and Sports Illustrated. Allen was often associated with fellow illustration mavericks, Robert Weaver and Robert Andrew Parker, who challenged the saccharine atmosphere of the post-war magazine scene. This group favored a somewhat radical journalistic approach to their role and firmly opposed an illustrator's role as mere page decorator. They developed personal styles and techniques that made their chosen subjects even more resonant. They favored observing the world, drawing from life, and creating visual essays. This approach would later be termed \\"visual journalism\\" and in 1983 would form the basis of a special master's degree, Illustration as Visual Essay, from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Allen was known for his album covers of country and jazz musicians. He formed lasting relationships with bluegrass music banjo artist Earl Scruggs of the duo Flatt and Scruggs. Allen created 17 album covers for the band and wrote the liner notes for their Live at Vanderbilt album. Another satisfied patron, S. Neil Fujita, an art director at CBS Records, gave Allen many assignments for their jazz catalog. Being present at actual recording sessions with Jimmy Rushing allowed Allen to hone his observation skills and create work that was \\"more authentic.\\" Later in his career, he began illustrating children's books. Titles include In Coal Country by Judith Hendershot and Grandma's General Store: The Ark by Dorothy Carter. He also spent much of his time in front of students eager to learn his trade. At the University of Kansas, Hallmark Cards funded a teaching position that landed Mr. Allen at that campus. He later moved to Florida to head up the illustration department at the Ringling College of Art and Design. He remained in that position until his death.

His songs include a wide spectrum of genres, including pop, ballads and tropical music; all infused with romantic lyric that reflect human emotions, Latino culture and love.  Biography  Jerem√≠as was born in London, where his parents were studying, and moved with his family to Venezuela when he was just two-years-old. He grew up moving around some of the country's biggest cities, including Caracas, Maracay, and Puerto Ordaz. At 7, Jeremias started collecting music, while learning to play the guitar. Literature was his chosen career path with the onslaught of college, but he switched his major halfway through college to Psychology, but finally settled on his life's greatest vocation: music. He claims that songwriting allows him to fuse the lyricism capabilities he discovered in Literature, with the understanding of the dynamics of human behavior and emotions he delved into while studying psychology. The singer and his girlfriend welcomed their first child, a girl named Sof√≠a, on August 23, 2017. Professional Life His career ensued at the age of 23. Dead set on songwriting exclusively, Jeremias began recording demos to show to record label and music executives in the hopes of selling songs. Instead he showcased his vocals so well that they recommended he sing his own songs. Jerem√≠as launched his singing career in 2002 and promoted most of first singles in Spain, where he made appearances on major television programs like Cr√≥nicas marcianas and M√∫sica S√≠. In 2003 Jeremias released his self-titled album, Jerem√≠as, which included songs like \\"La Cita\\" and \\"Desde el bar.\\" The songs became top- charting hits and transcended to successful performances and appearances. The song \\"Poco a Poco\\" became a record-breaking single chosen as the main soundtrack for a popular Venezuelan soap opera, Mi Gorda Bella. In 2005 he settled in Miami, and in 2006 released Ese Que Va Por Ah√≠, an album with both critical acclaim and resounding success in the United States, Latin America and Puerto Rico. That same year Jeremias was the only Latino artist ranked among Billboard Magazine's coveted \\"Who's Hot\\" list. The songs \\"Uno y uno es igual a tres\\" and \\"Hay un amor afuera\\" reached the top of Latin play list charts in both the US and Latin America. In 2008 he recorded his third album Un d√≠a m√°s en el gran circo, and the album's singles \\"El comienzo del final\\" and \\"T√∫\\" rank number one on Latin music charts. The songs music videos garner equal success, with top-rotating music videos on HTV. The album earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Album, and he closed the award show with a performance along Juanes, Belinda, Rosario, Pedro Carmona and Tommy Torres. In 2016, Jerem√≠as started working on his fourth album, with the Julca Brothers and Motiff as producers.

There was a thermometer called the \\"Quack Attack Meter\\" with Donald's head on the bottom. When the clip showed Donald getting angry, injured, or humiliated, the head on the thermometer would go up and make a dinging sound.

Once a firm's current earnings become known, the information content should be quickly digested by investors and incorporated into the efficient market price. However, it has long been known that this is not exactly what happens. For firms that report good news in quarterly earnings, their abnormal security returns tend to drift upwards for at least 60 days following their earnings announcement. Similarly, firms that report bad news in earnings tend to have their abnormal security returns drift downwards for a similar period. This phenomenon is called post-announcement drift. This was initially proposed by the information content study of Ray J. Ball & P. Brown, 'An empirical evaluation of accounting income numbers', Journal of Accounting Research, Autumn 1968, pp. 159‚Äì178. As one of major earnings anomalies, which supports the counterargument against market efficiency theory, PEAD is considered a robust finding and one of the most studied topics in financial market literature. The phenomenon can be explained with a number of hypotheses. The most widely accepted explanation for the effect is investor under-reaction to earnings announcements.

Evidence that stock prices do not fully reflect the implications of current earnings for future earnings. Journal of Accounting and Economics, 13(4), 305-340 provided a comprehensive summary of PEAD research. According to Bernard & Thomas (1990), PEAD patterns can be viewed as including two components. The first component is a positive autocorrelation between seasonal difference (i.e., seasonal random walk forecast errors ‚Äì the difference between the actual returns and forecasted returns) that is strongest for adjacent quarters, being positive over the first three lag quarters. Second, there is a negative auto correlation between seasonal differences that are four quarters apart. References * Do Individual Investors Drive Post Earnings Announcement Drift?

While most composers strive for artistic excellence in their work, music also serves to communicate. Without willing players and attentive audiences, any composition is merely a complex set of instructions.

His postwar assignments included command of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and service as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) in the Navy Department and as Vice Chief of Naval Operations. Biography Ramsey was born on 2 October 1888 at Whipple Barracks, near Prescott, Arizona, to Frank DeWitt Ramsey and Lillian Carlotta Zulick. He was the grandson of Arizona Territorial Governor C. Meyer Zulick. Upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy, Ramsey was commissioned an Ensign in June 1912. He took Juanita as his wife. In 1917 he qualified as a naval aviator. During World War I, he was Inspection Officer for United States Naval Air Stations in France, and a member of the Inter-Allied Naval Armistice Commission. During the interwar period, Ramsey served as a naval aviator on various naval staffs and ships. Reporting on board the aircraft carrier in 1938, he was her executive officer into 1939. Later that year, he headed BuAer's Plans Division, and in 1941 became Assistant Chief of BuAer. During World War II, he commanded the Saratoga up to and during the landings against Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, in August. For his skillful use of airpower against Japanese naval forces in the Solomons, he was awarded the Navy Cross. In the Saratoga, he next commanded a task force that included a British carrier, HMS Victorious (R38). Ramsey received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal as Chief of the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) from August 6, 1943, to June 1, 1945, and a Gold Star as Vice Chief of Naval Operations from January 15, 1946, to January 3, 1948. After commanding the Pacific Fleet, he served as Commissioner of Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, until retiring on 1 May 1949. Admiral Ramsey died 7 September 1961, at Naval Hospital Philadelphia at the age of 72.

It is mostly made up of episodes of short comedy sketches and spoofs on the Macedonian language. K-15 as a term is used for other projects with the group, such as the comical music of Duo Trio, different kinds of commercials or guest appearances in other shows and films such as Balkankan. K-15 was formed by Vasko Todorov, Ljupƒço \\"Bubo\\" Karov and Branko Ognjanovski, with frequent appearances of other actors/comedians. The three founders are also co-directors and co-producers. History The three characters decided to create a unique job opportunity for themselves - a weekly comedy show, not only providing them with a salary but also entertaining and making all those who live, know of or have experience with the social and cultural situation in Macedonia, laugh. The first episode was broadcast on November 23, 1994 on A1 TV.Article in the newspaper \\"Utrinski vesnik\\" Since then, the show has provided strong social, political and economic criticism of various peculiar events in the Macedonian society, ethnic tolerance, stereotypes, taboo-topics and the environment. K-15 aired on many TV channels such as MTV 1, Sitel, A1, Alfa TV and K-15 TV. In 2008 the group decided to form their own independent channel known as K-15 TV. The channel airs predominately Macedonian music with occasional K-15 sketches and commercials. K-15 TV is available on the satellite network too. Also, they have their own YouTube channel with more than 900 videos.  Impact on society  The show is still running, as of 2013. This Macedonian comedy trio has helped pave the very narrow path of open-mindedness and embodiment of the concepts of freedom of thought, expression and opinion, while shattering a half century old tradition of self- righteousness, faux-perfectionism, and pretentiousness that stem from the one party social order of communism in the former Yugoslavia. The fan base of K-15 is extremely wide in Macedonia. This is mainly fitting with the content of the jokes and skits of the show; problems and issues everyone can see first hand in their own community. Additionally, the show has also received a very large following outside of Macedonia as well, especially in the Macedonian diaspora in the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Australia.

The transport itself happens in vascular tissue, which exists in two forms: xylem and phloem. Both these tissues are present in a vascular bundle, which in addition will include supporting and protective tissues. The xylem typically lies adaxial with phloem positioned abaxial. In a stem or root this means that the xylem is closer to the centre of the stem or root while the phloem is closer to the exterior. In a leaf, the adaxial surface of the leaf will usually be the upper side, with the abaxial surface the lower side. This is why aphids are typically found on the underside of a leaf rather than on the top, since the sugars manufactured by the plant are transported by the phloem, which is closer to the lower surface. The position of vascular bundles relative to each other may vary considerably: see stele.

The area is a collection of small, unconnected subdivisions along Lexington Road and large estates built just outside Cherokee Park. Many of Louisville's early 20th Century elite lived in the area, drawn there by the large, undeveloped parcels of land near downtown. Most houses in the area were built from the 1920s to the 1950s, several being designed by noted Louisville residential architect Stratton Hammon. Cherokee Gardens is bounded by Lexington Road, Cannons Lane, and I-64. As of 2000, the population of Cherokee Gardens was 927. History The area was deeded to James Southall and Richard Charlton for their part in the French and Indian War. The land remained untouched well into the 1850s because it lay off Frankfort Avenue and Bardstown Road, the two major through routes of the area. In 1851 an alternative route of Frankfort Ave was built for travellers who wanted to avoid the railroad further down in Clifton. The new road was first called 'Shelbyville Branch', today it is called Lexington Road. The first subdivision called Cherokee Gardens was announced in 1925 by the firm of Otis & Bruce. Jr. it was built on land that had been a part of the Vigilini and Turner estates, with the Olmsted Brothers firm hired to design the landscaping. The lots were sold quickly, with 241 of the original 256 lots selling within 10 days of their initial offering for over $900,000 (). Many of these lots were combined by initial homeowners. The initial Cherokee Gardens subdivision consisted of homes built in the 1920s and 1930s off the streets, from west to east, Primrose, Fairfield, Barberry, Rainbow, Garden, Poppy, Sunset and Sunnyside. West of that, Cressbrook was developed in 1955. The homes off Daneshall Drive were built in 1968, in a small subdivision named for the original house which still stands, and was a well-known horse farm into the 1950s. Cherokee Gardens West, with homes off Altagate and Circlewood on the old Speed Estate, was built in 1970. Cherokee Woods subdivision, built off the road of that name and Juniper Hill Road, was built in 1974.

The site includes part of the ridge of the First Watchung Mountain. Its position provided a natural fortress not only protecting the Continental Army but also overlooking the plains towards New Brunswick, where the British forces were stationed in 1777. The strategic strength of the position contributed ultimately to the success of the Continental Army by lengthening the war and wearying the British forces. A portion of the encampment site, known as the Washington Camp Ground, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 3, 1975. First Middlebrook encampment (1777)  Enigma of the British Army During the winter of 1776-77, Washington initially encamped the Continental Army at Morristown, New Jersey. After his outpost garrison at Bound Brook was surprised and routed during the Battle of Bound Brook on April 13, 1777, Washington moved the encampment closer to Bound Brook to the Middlebrook encampment on May 28 and stayed there until July 2. A total of 8,298 soldiers were housed in the encampment, but 2,660 of them were sick or disabled, unable to fight. In contrast, the British maintained a force of about 17,000 near New Brunswick, New Jersey. From the heights of the Watchung mountains, Washington could monitor and counteract British movements. When General Howe decided to move against Philadelphia, concern over the threat by the Continental Army made him choose the safer sea route instead of the faster land route. This led to a significant delay in operations for the British and disrupted plans to help General Burgoyne in northern New York. On June 30, Howe moved his troops to Staten Island in preparation for his Philadelphia campaign, and two days later Washington left Middlebrook and moved the army to Pompton Plains. First flag: June 1777 It is largely conceded that it was at the Middlebrook encampment that the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. This event is commemorated annually since 1889 on July 4 with a changing of the flag, a reading of the Declaration of Independence, and the delivery of an historical address at the Washington Camp Ground. Also, by special order of Congress, a Thirteen Star Flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground. Second Middlebrook encampment (1778‚Äì79)  Washington used the area around Middlebrook as a cantonment site, known as the Middlebrook Cantonment, during the winter of 1778‚Äì79. He brought about 8,000‚Äì10,000 troops to the camp site by November 30, 1778. Soldiers constructed cabins from logs covered with clay similar as they had done at Morristown. Washington himself rented the Wallace House (now converted to a museum) in Somerville for four months and paid Wallace $1,000. General von Steuben lived at the Staats House in South Bound Brook. General Henry Knox lived at the Jacobus Vanderveer House near Pluckemin with the Continental Artillery camped at the Pluckemin Continental Artillery Cantonment Site. Nathanael Greene lived at the Van Veghten House in Finderne. The main body of the much larger British army was at New York. The camp was closed on June 3, 1779 when Washington led his army to Highlands, New York. Today Entrance to Washington Camp Ground, Middlebrook encampment The Washington Camp Ground, on Middlebrook Road in Bridgewater Township, just north of Route 22, was deemed a historic site by local citizens in 1889, and entered the National Register of Historic Places July 3, 1975. The site is owned and preserved by the Washington Camp Ground Association, which also organizes the annual July 4 program at the site. The program includes a public reading of the complete Declaration of Independence, which has been read at the site each July 4 for about 120 years. Various other sites related to the encampment, in Bridgewater and surrounding towns, are accessible to the public. These include Washington Rock State Park, an observation site on top of the Watchung mountain ridge, in Green Brook, Washington Valley Park in Bridgewater (nearby, but separate from, the Washington Camp Ground), the Wallace House in Somerville, the Van Veghten House near Manville, the Jacobus Vanderveer House near Pluckemin, and the Staats House in South Bound Brook. A sign commemorating the encampment also stands in a now-developed area, at the corner of Chimney Rock and Gilbride Roads in Bridgewater.

Waterford is northwest of Washington, D.C., and northwest of Leesburg. The entire village and surrounding countryside is a National Historic Landmark District, noted for its well-preserved 18th and 19th-century character. In the 1810 United States Census, the population center of the United States was recorded as being just northwest of the village. History =Founding = Waterford was established around 1733 by Amos Janney, a Quaker from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Janney purchased on the south fork of Catoctin Creek and established a grist mill and saw mill in the area in the 1740s. Due to the success of the mills, the settlement became known as \\"Janney's Mill\\". The town grew quickly as a center of commerce for growers of grain. =Growth= Amos Janney died in 1747, leaving his estate to his sixteen-year-old son, Mahlon. Mahlon replaced the original log mill with a two-story structure. The village continued to grow, and in 1780, on the south side of Main Street were subdivided into 15 lots, upon which shops and homes were built. By the 1790s, the village was known as Waterford, named after the city of Waterford, in Ireland, where some of its founders had once lived before immigrating to the United States. New residents continued to come from Pennsylvania, as Quakers were followed by Presbyterians, Lutherans, Baptists, and Methodists. Waterford was also populated by African-Americans, both free and enslaved. =Civil War= By the start of the Civil War, the population of Waterford remained largely Quaker. As pacifists and abolitionists, the Quakers remained loyal to the Union throughout the war. Waterford was the scene of a fierce fight between the county's Unionist and Confederate partisan units, the Loudoun Rangers and White's Rebels, respectively. In those days, it was the home for mostly Quakers who helped slaves escape to the North.  Waterford today  After falling into disrepair in the early part of the 20th century, the Waterford Foundation was formed to help save and preserve Waterford and its history. In 1974, the Waterford Foundation helped create an innovative land preservation program in which the historic properties of Waterford are protected through open space and fa√ßade easements. More than 60 easements have been granted. The town today is largely residential, although a number of businesses are based in the village. The Loudoun Mutual Insurance Company has been located in Waterford since 1849. National Historic Landmark The village was listed as a Virginia Historic Landmark in 1969. (with property zone map and more) Waterford and a significant portion of its surrounding countryside was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. The designation was made in recognition of the town's well-preserved 18th and 19th-century architecture and landscape. Significant buildings include the mill (circa 1750), Arch House Row (circa 1750), Camelot School (circa 1800), the Hague-Hough house, which is Waterford's oldest house (circa 1740), and the 1882 Presbyterian church. and The Catoctin Creek Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and the William Virts House was listed in 2011.

The hypothesis, given its initial characterisation in a paper by David Milner and Melvyn A. Goodale in 1992, argues that humans possess two distinct visual systems. Recently there seems to be evidence of two distinct auditory systems as well. As visual information exits the occipital lobe, and as sound leaves the phonological network, it follows two main pathways, or \\"streams\\". The ventral stream (also known as the \\"what pathway\\") leads to the temporal lobe, which is involved with object and visual identification and recognition. The dorsal stream (or, \\"where pathway\\") leads to the parietal lobe, which is involved with processing the object's spatial location relative to the viewer and with speech repetition. History Several researchers had proposed similar ideas previously. The authors themselves credit the inspiration of work on blindsight by Weiskrantz, and previous neuroscientific vision research. Schneider first proposed the existence of two visual systems for localisation and identification in 1969. Ingle described two independent visual systems in frogs in 1973. Ettlinger reviewed the existing neuropsychological evidence of a distinction in 1990. Moreover, Trevarthen had offered an account of two separate mechanisms of vision in monkeys back in 1968. In 1982 Ungerleider and Mishkin distinguished the dorsal and ventral streams, as processing spatial and visual features respectively, from their lesion studies of monkeys ‚Äì proposing the original where vs what distinction. Though this framework was superseded by that of Milner & Goodale, it remains influential. One hugely influential source of information that has informed the model has been experimental work exploring the extant abilities of visual agnosic patient D.F. The first, and most influential report, came from Goodale and colleagues in 1991 and work is still being published on her two decades later. This has been the focus of some criticism of the model due to the perceived over-reliance on findings from a single case. Two visual systems Goodale and Milner amassed an array of anatomical, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and behavioural evidence for their model. According to their data, the ventral 'perceptual' stream computes a detailed map of the world from visual input, which can then be used for cognitive operations, and the dorsal 'action' stream transforms incoming visual information to the requisite egocentric (head-centered) coordinate system for skilled motor planning. The model also posits that visual perception encodes spatial properties of objects, such as size and location, relative to other objects in the visual field; in other words, it utilizes relative metrics and scene-based frames of reference. Visual action planning and coordination, on the other hand, uses absolute metrics determined via egocentric frames of reference, computing the actual properties of objects relative to the observer. Thus, grasping movements directed towards objects embedded in size-contrast- ambiguous scenes have been shown to escape the effects of these illusions, as different frames of references and metrics are involved in the perception of the illusion versus the execution of the grasping act. Norman proposed a similar dual-process model of vision, and described eight main differences between the two systems consistent with other two-system models. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Factor ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Ventral system (what) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Dorsal system (where) - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Function Recognition/identification Visually guided behaviour - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Sensitivity High spatial frequencies - details High temporal frequencies - motion - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Memory Long term stored representations Only very short-term storage - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Speed Relatively slow Relatively fast - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Consciousness Typically high Typically low - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Frame of reference Allocentric or object- centered Egocentric or viewer-centered - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Visual input Mainly foveal or parafoveal Across retina - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Monocular vision Generally reasonably small effects Often large effects e.g. motion parallax } =Dorsal stream= The dorsal stream is proposed to be involved in the guidance of actions and recognizing where objects are in space. Also known as the parietal stream, the \\"where\\" stream, or the \\"how\\" stream, this pathway stretches from the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe forward into the parietal lobe. It is interconnected with the parallel ventral stream (the \\"what\\" stream) which runs downward from V1 into the temporal lobe. General features The dorsal stream is involved in spatial awareness and guidance of actions (e.g., reaching). In this it has two distinct functional characteristics‚Äîit contains a detailed map of the visual field, and is also good at detecting and analyzing movements. The dorsal stream commences with purely visual functions in the occipital lobe before gradually transferring to spatial awareness at its termination in the parietal lobe. The posterior parietal cortex is essential for \\"the perception and interpretation of spatial relationships, accurate body image, and the learning of tasks involving coordination of the body in space\\". It contains individually functioning lobules. The lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP) contains neurons that produce enhanced activation when attention is moved onto the stimulus or the animal saccades towards a visual stimulus, and the ventral intraparietal sulcus (VIP) where visual and somatosensory information are integrated. Effects of damage or lesions Damage to the posterior parietal cortex causes a number of spatial disorders including: * Simultanagnosia: where the patient can only describe single objects without the ability to perceive it as a component of a set of details or objects in a context (as in a scenario, e.g. the forest for the trees). * Optic ataxia: where the patient can't use visuospatial information to guide arm movements. * Hemispatial neglect: where the patient is unaware of the contralesional half of space (that is, they are unaware of things in their left field of view and focus only on objects in the right field of view; or appear unaware of things in one field of view when they perceive them in the other). For example, a person with this disorder may draw a clock, and then label all twelve of the numbers on one side of the face and consider the drawing complete. * Akinetopsia: inability to perceive motion. * Apraxia: inability to produce discretionary or volitional movement in the absence of muscular disorders. =Ventral stream= The ventral stream is associated with object recognition and form representation. Also described as the \\"what\\" stream, it has strong connections to the medial temporal lobe (which stores long-term memories), the limbic system (which controls emotions), and the dorsal stream (which deals with object locations and motion). The ventral stream gets its main input from the parvocellular (as opposed to magnocellular) layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. These neurons project to V1 sublayers 4CŒ≤, 4A, 3B and 2/3a successively. From there, the ventral pathway goes through V2 and V4 to areas of the inferior temporal lobe: PIT (posterior inferotemporal), CIT (central inferotemporal), and AIT (anterior inferotemporal). Each visual area contains a full representation of visual space. That is, it contains neurons whose receptive fields together represent the entire visual field. Visual information enters the ventral stream through the primary visual cortex and travels through the rest of the areas in sequence. Moving along the stream from V1 to AIT, receptive fields increase their size, latency, and the complexity of their tuning. All the areas in the ventral stream are influenced by extraretinal factors in addition to the nature of the stimulus in their receptive field. These factors include attention, working memory, and stimulus salience. Thus the ventral stream does not merely provide a description of the elements in the visual world‚Äîit also plays a crucial role in judging the significance of these elements. Damage to the ventral stream can cause inability to recognize faces or interpret facial expression. Two auditory systems =Ventral stream= comprehension of the phrase 'my cat' in the extended version of Hickok and Poeppel's dual pathway model Along with the visual ventral pathway being important for visual processing, there is also a ventral auditory pathway emerging from the primary auditory cortex. In this pathway, phonemes are processed posteriorly to syllables and environmental sounds. The information then joins the visual ventral stream at the middle temporal gyrus and temporal pole. Here the auditory objects are converted into audio-visual concepts. =Dorsal stream= The function of the auditory dorsal pathway is to map the auditory sensory representations onto articulatory motor representations. Hickok & Poeppel claim that the auditory dorsal pathway is necessary because, \\"learning to speak is essentially a motor learning task. The primary input to this is sensory, speech in particular. So, there must be a neural mechanism that both codes and maintains instances of speech sounds, and can use these sensory traces to guide the tuning of speech gestures so that the sounds are accurately reproduced.\\" repetition of the phrase 'what is your name?' in the extended version of Hickok and Poeppel's dual pathway model In contrast to the ventral stream's auditory processing, information enters from the primary auditory cortex into the posterior superior temporal gyrus and posterior superior temporal sulcus. From there the information moves to the beginning of the dorsal pathway, which is located at the boundary of the temporal and parietal lobes near the Sylvian fissure. The first step of the dorsal pathway begins in the sensorimotor interface, located in the left Sylvian parietal temporal (Spt) (within the Sylvian fissure at the parietal- temporal boundary). The spt is important for perceiving and reproducing sounds. This is evident because its ability to acquire new vocabulary, be disrupted by lesions and auditory feedback on speech production, articulatory decline in late-onset deafness and the non-phonological residue of Wernicke's aphasia; deficient self-monitoring. It is also important for the basic neuronal mechanisms for phonological short-term memory. Without the Spt, language acquisition is impaired. The information then moves onto the articulatory network, which is divided into two separate parts. The articulatory network 1, which processes motor syllable programs, is located in the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus and Brodmann's area 44 (pIFG-BA44). The articulatory network 2 is for motor phoneme programs and is located in the left M1-vBA6. Conduction aphasia affects a subject's ability to reproduce speech (typically by repetition), though it has no influence on the subject's ability to comprehend spoken language. This shows that conduction aphasia must reflect not an impairment of the auditory ventral pathway but instead of the auditory dorsal pathway. Buchsbaum et al found that conduction aphasia can be the result of damage, particularly lesions, to the Spt (Sylvian parietal temporal). This is shown by the Spt's involvement in acquiring new vocabulary, for while experiments have shown that most conduction aphasiacs can repeat high-frequency, simple words, their ability to repeat low-frequency, complex words is impaired. The Spt is responsible for connecting the motor and auditory systems by making auditory code accessible to the motor cortex. It appears that the motor cortex recreates high-frequency, simple words (like cup) in order to more quickly and efficiently access them, while low- frequency, complex words (like Sylvian parietal temporal) require more active, online regulation by the Spt. This explains why conduction aphasiacs have particular difficulty with low-frequency words which requires a more hands-on process for speech production. \\"Functionally, conduction aphasia has been characterized as a deficit in the ability to encode phonological information for production,\\" namely because of a disruption in the motor-auditory interface. Conduction aphasia has been more specifically related to damage of the arcuate fasciculus, which is vital for both speech and language comprehension, as the arcuate fasiculus makes up the connection between Broca and Wernicke's areas. Criticisms Goodale & Milner's innovation was to shift the perspective from an emphasis on input distinctions, such as object location versus properties, to an emphasis on the functional relevance of vision to behaviour, for perception or for action. Contemporary perspectives however, informed by empirical work over the past two decades, offer a more complex account than a simple separation of function into two-streams. Recent experimental work for instance has challenged these findings, and has suggested that the apparent dissociation between the effects of illusions on perception and action is due to differences in attention, task demands, and other confounds. There are other empirical findings, however, that cannot be so easily dismissed which provide strong support for the idea that skilled actions such as grasping are not affected by pictorial illusions. Moreover, recent neuropsychological research has questioned the validity of the dissociation of the two streams that has provided the cornerstone of evidence for the model. The dissociation between visual agnosia and optic ataxia has been challenged by several researchers as not as strong as originally portrayed; Hesse and colleagues demonstrated dorsal stream impairments in patient DF; Himmelbach and colleagues reassessed DF's abilities and applied more rigorous statistical analysis demonstrating that the dissociation wasn't as strong as first thought. A 2010 review of the accumulated evidence for the model concluded that whilst the spirit of the model has been vindicated the independence of the two streams has been overemphasised. Goodale & Milner themselves have proposed the analogy of tele-assistance, one of the most efficient schemes devised for the remote control of robots working in hostile environments. In this account, the dorsal stream is viewed as a semi- autonomous function that operates under guidance of executive functions which themselves are informed by ventral stream processing. Thus the emerging perspective within neuropsychology and neurophysiology is that, whilst a two- systems framework was a necessary advance to stimulate study of the highly complex and differentiated functions of the two neural pathways; the reality is more likely to involve considerable interaction between vision-for-action and vision-for-perception.

Despite being discussed in various interviews throughout the 1990s, Black Aria II was not released until October 17, 2006. The album reached the top 10 on the Billboard classical music chart. Music and recording The writing of Black Aria II was completed in early 2001. The recording began in late 2004, with the majority of tracks finished by early 2005. Due to the album release date being delayed by record label issues, Glenn Danzig used the extra time to further refine the album and record an extra song. The subtitle of Black Aria II is Lilith, Whore of the Desert, a reference to Lilith, the first wife of Adam and the subject of the album's content. Danzig explained ‚ÄúThis one is more Eastern, because it's about Lilith. It still has a lot of the classic elements I like, but many of the sounds come from elsewhere because of this fascinating story, which has its origins in even older myths and legends.‚Äù Black Aria II is produced, written and - with a couple of exceptions - performed by Danzig. Tommy Victor provides some additional guitar, and Tania Themmen performs female vocals. The music employs various sounds, including organ, strings, percussion, chimes, chants and lamentations. Some of the pieces comprise up to 40 individual music tracks. \\"Unclean Sephira\\" consists entirely of layered vocal tracks. Discussing the writing and recording process, Danzig stated ‚ÄúI just let the story take me. Each song tells me what it wants. Sometimes I have it all written in my head - every single part. But at other times, I'll be doing the skeleton framework and different parts will come to me. At times, I'll be listening to playback and suddenly I'll hear where another part can go. It tells me what I need to add.‚Äù Reception * Allmusic - \\"Far bleaker and more minimalist than its first inception, Black Aria II relies less on string- fueled dread and more on operatic vocals and experimental sounds...there's not a lot to sink your teeth into, but if there were a subcategory in the new age section of your local record store that was reserved for meditation music for the hooded, the damned, and the downright evil, then Black Aria II would must definitely have its own kiosk.\\" * antiMusic - \\"Every song and instrument is right on. While some people might feel odd listening to a classical CD that has plenty of weird and demonic sounding chants in the background, I urge you to take Black Aria II for a spin. Black Aria II is a beautifully crafted, spooky masterpiece from Glenn.\\" * Punknews.org - \\"The sequel to 1992s Black Aria features a similar tone to its predecessor. However, this piece features less classical music exercises and more dirge-like compositions...It seems engaging standard musical tastes wasn't Danzig's goal here. Instead of creating a good \\"song\\", the album suggests Danzig wanted to create an interesting sonic experience. In place of a clever refrain, the album features an interesting sound. Instead of a snappy riff, a new style of multi-tracking is utilized. The music doesn't drive the listener, as with a classic Misfits track. Rather, it washes over the listener, submerging him or her in a mood rather than a rhythm.\\" * Verbicide Magazine - \\"The album is a haunting, eerie disc that requires more than one listen to fully appreciate. Once you know the story (or any given interpretation of it anyway), the disc becomes so much more than an album of creepy music from the Danzig front man, but becomes the soundtrack to the birth of evil.\\"http://www.verbicidemagazine.com/2006/10/30/interview-glenn-danzig/ Artwork Artist Bill Sienkiewicz painted the album's cover art.

The method was introduced by Francis P. Robinson, an American education philosopher in his 1946 book Effective Study. The method offers a more efficient and active approach to reading textbook material. It was created for college students, but is extremely useful for young students as well. Classrooms all over the world have begun using this method to better understand what they are reading. Similar methods developed subsequently include PQRST and KWL table.  Process  #Survey (\\"S\\") #:The first step, survey or skim, advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead first go through a chapter and note the headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features, such as figures, tables, marginal information, and summary paragraphs. This survey step typically only takes 3‚Äì5 minutes, but it provides an outline or framework for what will be presented. The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter. #Question (\\"Q\\") #:Generate questions about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and sub-headings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated: #:* What is this chapter about? #:* What question is this chapter trying to answer? #:* How does this information help me? #Read (R1) #:Use the background work done with \\"S\\" and \\"Q\\" in order to begin reading actively. This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under \\"Q\\". Passive reading, in contrast, results in merely reading without engaging with the study material. #Retrieve (R2) #:The second \\"R\\" refers to the part known as \\"Retrieve.\\" The reader should try to retrieve from memory what was learned in the same manner as telling someone else about the information. It is important that the reader use his/her own words in order to formulate and conceptualize the material. Try recalling and identifying major points (heading/subheadings) and answers to questions from the \\"Q\\" step. This recital step may be done either in an oral or written format and is related to the benefits of retrieval (testing effect) in boosting long-term memory for the material. #Review (R3) #:The final \\"R\\" is \\"Review.\\" Once you reach the end of the passage, review the material by repeating back to yourself what the point of the passage is using your own words.

The relevant passages are found in V√∂lusp√°, the first at stanza 8 occurring after the creation of the universe during a time of peace and prosperity: ::In their dwellings at peace they played at tables ::Of gold no lack did the gods then know Here the playing at tables refers to Tafl, a family of ancient Germanic board games somewhat resembling chess, although which variant of Tafl is being played or its rules are not known. At this point a long period of struggle and conflict begins with the arrival of three powerful giant maidens from J√∂tunheim, possibly the three great Norns. What follows in the V√∂lusp√° is a synopsis of the entire mythology until the gods and the universe are destroyed during the final conflict of Ragnar√∂k. However, a new earth is reborn from the sea, green and beautiful, and those gods who have survived the battle and conflagration gather to share their memories of the past.

It may have a role when thiazides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are not appropriate or have failed to control blood pressure. In addition, it demonstrates favourable effects on parameters of the insulin resistance syndrome, apparently independent of blood pressure reduction. It is also a growth hormone releaser. It is manufactured by Solvay Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Abbott in 2009) under the brand name Physiotens & Moxon. Mechanism of action Moxonidine is a selective agonist at the imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1). This receptor subtype is found in both the rostral ventro-lateral pressor and ventromedial depressor areas of the medulla oblongata. Moxonidine therefore causes a decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity and, therefore, a decrease in blood pressure. Compared to the older central-acting antihypertensives, moxonidine binds with much greater affinity to the imidazoline I1-receptor than to the Œ±2-receptor. In contrast, clonidine binds to both receptors with near equal affinity. Moxonidine has an affinity for I1 that is 33 times greater than Œ±2, compared to clonidine which is only four times greater. In addition, moxonidine may also promote sodium excretion, improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance and protect against hypertensive target organ damage, such as kidney disease and cardiac hypertrophy. Pharmacodynamic properties Effects on insulin resistance In all animal models of insulin resistance, moxonidine had striking effects on the development of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose homeostasis. Given the importance of insulin resistance as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is of considerable relevance that it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. Safety pharmacology Routine toxicology studies have provided no evidence that moxonidine has any teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. No evidence has been found of serious adverse effects on organs or organ systems, and the drug has not been shown to have deleterious effects on perinatal or postnatal growth and development. Cautions Moxonidine should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug should also be avoided. If concomitant treatment with a beta blocker has to be stopped, the beta blocker should be discontinued first, then moxonidine after a few days. Alcohol may potentiate the hypotensive effects of Moxonidine. Drug synergistic effects Concomitant administration of moxonidine and a thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide gave a synergistic antihypertensive effect. Contraindications It is contraindicated if there has been a past history of angioedema; heart conduction disorders (e.g. sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree heart block); bradycardia; severe heart failure or coronary artery disease. Also: Raynaud's syndrome, intermittent claudication, epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, glaucoma. Use in pregnancy is discouraged. Moxonidine passes into breast milk. Excess mortality has been seen in patients with symptomatic heart failure in the MOXCON study. However, the MOXCON trial utilised a very high dose of 3.0 mg daily which is well above the normal dose of 0.2‚Äì0.6 mg daily. Side- effects Noteworthy side effects include dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness, intermittent facial oedema, nausea, sleep disturbances (rarely sedation), asthenia, vasodilatation, and rarely, skin reactions.

According to prosecutors, he accepted a $25,000 bribe to intervene in the federal investigation of Monarch Construction Company of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1971, Dowdy was convicted on eight counts: two of conspiracy, one of transporting a bribe over state lines, and five of perjury. In 1973, after Dowdy retired from Congress, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, overturned the bribery and conspiracy convictions. Dowdy still served a sentence in prison for perjury. Dowdy was one of four U.S. Congressmen from Texas to originally sign the \\"Southern Manifesto,\\" a resolution in protest of the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Dowdy enjoyed having witnesses in House hearings describe homosexual acts in detail. He was fascinated by same- sex intercourse and publicly admitted to reading gay pornography. Right-wing groups rallied to his defense, including the Washington Observer and the Liberty Lobby, which contended Dowdy was the victim of a \\"vicious frame-up by the Justice Department in collaboration with a clique of housing racketeers.\\" The ulterior motive, according to the newspaper, was to stop Dowdy's subcommittee investigation of the fraud at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Washington Observer, April 15, 1973.

In 1967, he was one of the main leaders of the Naxalbari uprising and in 1969 he was one of the founding leaders of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI (ML)). Sanyal committed suicide on 23 March 2010. Formation and growth of CPI (ML) Kanu Sanyal joined Communist politics, first as a member of CPI then CPI(M). He later went on to become a leader of the CPI(ML). He belonged to the Harmad class of the CPI(M). He announced the formation of the original CPI (ML) on Vladimir Lenin's birthday in 1969 at a public rally in Calcutta. He came out with the seminal Terai report on revolution in India, which openly denounced the anarco-nihilist policies of Charu Majumdar and his loyalists. After the failure of the Naxalite uprising, Sanyal went into hiding. The death of his colleague Charu Majumdar was followed by the breakup of the Naxalite movement, and Sanyal was claimed to have abandoned violent means and accepted parliamentary practice as a form of revolutionary activity. Arrest He was eventually cornered and arrested in August 1970. News of his arrest sparked of region-wide violence by the radical communists. CPI(ML) cadres destroyed property, raided and attacked educational institutions, and engaged in rioting. Jail life For seven years Sanyal was imprisoned in a jail in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh in the case known as the Parvatipuram Naxalite Conspiracy case. He was convicted in the Parvatipuram Conspiracy Case, by the Sessions Judge. Sanyal was released from jail in 1977, following the shift of government in India as well as in West Bengal. Jyoti Basu, the new CPI(M) chief minister, personally intervened to ensure Sanyal's release. By the time of his release, Sanyal had publicly condemned the original strategy of armed struggle of the CPI(ML), without building prior and proper popular mass base amongst the common people.The road from Naxalbari Kanunu Sanyal was released from Jail by another CPIM Jyoti Basu. Kanununu Sanyal attended CPIM all patry meetings till the end of his life. After his release Sanyal rallied his supporters and formed the Organising Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (OCCR). Formation of COI (ML) In 1985 Sanyal's faction along with five other groups, merged to form the Communist Organisation of India (Marxist- Leninist). Sanyal became the leader of COI(ML). Later years In his later years, Sanyal continued his broad engagement in political activism, including the labour movement and land rights. For these activities he was arrested and detained several times, in spite of his old age. On 18 January 2006, while protesting against a lockout of tea garden workers in the region, Sanyal and other fellow agitators were arrested for causing a train to be held up at the New Jalpaiguri Railway Station in Siliguri, North Bengal. As of late 2006, Sanyal became a prominent figure in the opposition to land acquisition in Singur. On 8 December he was arrested and detained along with three other Naxalite leaders, after the police stopped and charged a demonstration procession. In Folklore He has been remembered in Public life by world poet and singer Roddur Roy- Roy sings: Buddhadeber podh mara geche Kanununu Sanyal shokal bela kheche Laker dhare khaler dhare altufaltu joto Jyoti Basur moto podh utle more ache koto Ganashakti, anandabazar patrika mile Bangla bhashar gand mere koreche ghile Death On 23 Mar 2010, he was found hanging at his residence at Seftullajote village, 25 km Siliguri (West Bengal) from where Naxal Movement began under his leadership. Sanyal was suffering from old-age related cardio pulmonary ailments. At the time of his death he was the general secretary of a new CPI(ML), formed by merger of several splinter groups of the original party.

(1958) is a science fiction novel by American writer Algis Budrys, set during the Cold War. It was adapted into a 1974 film starring Elliott Gould. Plot An explosion resulting from an experiment gone awry rocks an Allied research facility near the border with the Soviet Bloc. A Soviet team abducts Dr. Lucas Martino, a leading Allied physicist in charge of a secret, high- priority project called K-88. Several months later, under American pressure, the Soviet officials finally hand over an individual, claiming that he is Dr. Martino. The man has undergone extensive surgery for his injuries. He has a mechanical arm that is more advanced than any produced in the West. More importantly, his head is now a nearly featureless metal skull, a kind of extreme craniofacial prosthesis. A medical evaluation reveals that several of the man's internal organs are also artificial. His biological arm and its hand's fingerprints are identified as Martino's, but this may be the result of an arm and hand transplantation. The Allies are suspicious that the Soviets have sent them a technologically altered spy and are holding the real Martino for further interrogation. The struggle to determine the man's true identity is the novel's central conflict. In the end, Shawn Rogers, the agent given the task, is unable to reach a conclusion. The man is released, but kept under surveillance and barred from working on physics projects. Later, when progress bogs down on the K-88 project, Rogers is sent to ask him to come back to work. The man refuses to go, and when finally asked directly if he is Lucas Martino, says simply \\"No\\": a reply that will later be seen as trenchantly mordant. Budrys tells the story in alternating chapters. Every second chapter relates part of Lucas Martino's life, highlighting his family, his struggle to support a career in physics, and his dalliances in romance. The young man spent his formative years in an Italian American New Jersey farm community (with English as his second language), then works his way through the City College of New York, and graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The last part of the novel tells what happened on the Soviet side. It takes many weeks for doctors to save Martino's life. Soviet interrogator Anastas Azarin has little time to work with and is thrown off by the prisoner's expressionless appearance. An attempt was actually made to replace Martino with a Soviet agent (his former MIT roommate, who knows him well enough to take on the role), and who was to disappear in a staged air crash, but this fails. Thus, at the end of the book the mystery is resolved to the reader's satisfaction: the man is indeed Lucas Martino, not a Soviet agent, and he is perfectly willing to resume his scientific work. But since the Western authorities cannot be sure of that, he will never be allowed near sensitive material again; rather, he is doomed to live out the rest of his life as an obscure farmer, under a shadow of suspicion that he will never be able to dispel. The treatment he received on his return, the endless suspicion and hostility, transformed him: he is indeed no longer the Lucas Martino he was before the accident, hence the mordant quality of his final reply to Rogers.

It was adapted into an anime television series by Tatsunoko Production and aired on Fuji TV from May 8, 1965 to April 28, 1966. Anime Sols attempted to crowdfund the series in 2014. Overview Space Ace is the story of a young alien boy named Space Ace (or Ace for short), given to homesick stargazing with the faces of his loved ones ghosted across the heavens. His tool of preference is the galaxy ring, a flat white hoop he can produce from his fingers to be thrown or ride on. The supporting cast includes Dr. Tatsunoko, who is almost a father figure to Ace, and his daughter Asari, Ace‚Äôs love interest. Providing the show's comedy relief was crusading investigative reporter Yadokari, who usually burst on the scene riding his jet skycycle at the worst possible moment, screaming for Ace to give him interviews and so on. One of the show's most important characters is \\"Ebo\\", Ace's imagined projection into the night sky depicted as a humanoid robot.

Mission Vuelta al Campo seeks to encourage impoverished and unemployed urban Venezuelans to willingly return to the countryside. Prior to the Ch√°vez administration, Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth discoveries and extraction commenced in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85% (far higher than the average for both Latin America and the Third World and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer. The Ley de Tierras -- \\"Law of the Lands\\" -- was passed by presidential decree in November 2001; it included the creation of a Plan Zamora to implement land reforms, including redistribution, in Venezuelan agriculture. Underutilized or unused private corporate and agricultural estates would now be subject to expropriation after fair-market compensation was paid to the owners. Inheritable, inalienable, and at times communal land grants were also made to small farmers and farmer's collectives. The rationale given for this program was that it would provide incentives for the eventual and gradual repopulation of the countryside and provide \\"food security\\" for the country by lessening the present dependence on foreign imports. There are three types of land that may be distributed under the program: # government land, # land that is claimed by private owners, but whose claims the government disputes, # and underutilized private land. To date, the Ch√°vez government has only distributed the first two types of land. Mission Vuelta al Campo fits into this context by seeking to facilitate the willing migration of urban residents back to the countryside in order to receive the benefits of these redistributions. The Ch√°vez government desires that, with increased small-scale farming and ranching by formerly poor, mostly slum-dwelling Venezuelans, both increased economic opportunities of the poor as well as the food sovereignty of Venezuela may be secured.

It is situated in the heart of the old city, right next to the Rundet√•rn (the Round Tower). History Regensen seen from Store Kannikestr√¶de in 1749 Commissioned by King Christian IV and inaugurated by Royal Charter by on 1 July 1623, Regensen has for centuries provided a unique living and working environment for 100 students. Some of the buildings burned down along with the rest city in the Great Fire of Copenhagen in 1728, but was rebuilt the same year. Regensen in the 1840s with Rundet√•rn in the background Regensen's mission is to provide housing to talented yet non-privileged students at the University of Copenhagen (KU) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Until the 1980s, the foundation behind Regensen, Kommunitetet, provided free housing and a scholarship for students chosen for admission. Because of financial difficulties, a small fee was introduced, which today is DKK 1,600 per month. This is still well under housing price levels in Copenhagen and Regensen thus continues to provide financial stability for its students. It is the second oldest of the old dormitories of the University of Copenhagen, and many old student traditions live on making the place very lively. Danish citizens studying at the University of Copenhagen or the Technical University of Denmark who have completed two years of full-time studies (120 ECTS points) and have an average grade of at least 7 (in the Danish grading system), can be considered for admission to one of its 100 rooms. Applications are open twice a year, corresponding with the start of the Spring and Autumn semesters. Applications are typically quite competitive, with 120-150 applications for around 10 spots. Since 2013 there are two scholarships a year for foreign students, in honour of Jonas Thomsen Sekyere. The residents of Regensen organize themselves in small 'clubs' in which they gather to eat, drink and socialize. The current clubs are 'Gamle' ('Old'), 'Siqno', 'Konvencio' (formerly Konventet), 'PIP' (Primus Inter Pares), 'Ping', 'Skrap' (Skr√¶p - a sword owned by a danish mythical king), 'HOF' (Carlsbergs HOF), 'Tilia', and 'Uglen' ('The Owl'). Many of Denmark's major social and political debates through the ages have taken shape in the College, through the many prominent alumni ranging from scientists to dramatists, novelists, poets and politicians.

It lies on the Orne River from its source and north-by-northeast of Alen√ßon. Name The town's name derives from the Latin (civitas) Sagiensis \\"city of the Sagii\\", a Gaulish tribe that turned it into its capital city. The traditional spelling was S√©ez, which has been retained by the Church; the Diocese of S√©ez is headed by the Bishop of S√©ez. However, the spelling S√©es was adopted for the town by the civil authorities following Napoleon's successful Italian campaign of 1796‚Äì7, one result of which was to bring another (Savoyan) S√©ez into France. History The first bishop of S√©es was St Lain, who lived about the fourth century. In the ninth century, S√©es was a fortified town and fell a prey to the Normans. At that period S√©es had two distinct parts: the Orne: the bishop's borough to the north and the new count's borough (Bourg le Comte) to the south. The counts of Alen√ßon took control in 1356. It was captured and recaptured in the wars between Henry II of England and his sons. In the Hundred Years' War it was one of the first towns of Normandy to fall into the hands of the English, in 1418. Pillaged by the Protestants during the Wars of Religion, S√©es attached itself to the Catholic League in 1589, but voluntarily surrendered to Henry IV of France in 1590. =Heraldry= Sights The town is an episcopal see and has a Gothic cathedral of remarkably bold architecture. The cathedral dates from the 13th and 14th centuries and occupies the site of three earlier churches. The west front, which is obscured by the buttresses flying from it, has two stately spires of open work high. The nave was built towards the end of the 13th century. The choir, built soon afterwards, is remarkable for the lightness of its construction. In the choir are four bas-reliefs of great beauty representing scenes in the life of the Virgin Mary; and the altar is adorned with another depicting the removal of the relics of St. Gervais and St. Protais. The church has been the object of frequent restoration and reconstruction. Other noteworthy buildings are the episcopal palace (1778), with a pretty chapel; the higher seminary, located in the old abbey of St. Martin, supposed to be one of the 14 or 15 monasteries founded in the sixth century by St. Evroult; and the sumptuous modern chapel of the Immaculate Conception, a resort of pilgrims.

Gorbachev's Demokratizatsiya meant the introduction of multi- candidate‚Äîthough not multiparty‚Äîelections for local Communist Party (CPSU) officials and Soviets. In this way, he hoped to rejuvenate the party with progressive personnel who would carry out his institutional and policy reforms. The CPSU would retain sole custody of the ballot box. \\\\- Russia, section Demokratizatsiya. Data as of July 1996 (retrieved December 25, 2014) The slogan of Demokratizatsiya was part of Gorbachev's set of reform programs, including glasnost (increasing public discussion of issues and accessibility of information to the public), officially announced in mid-1986, and uskoreniye, a \\"speed-up\\" of economic development. Perestroika (political and economic restructuring), another slogan that became a full-scale campaign in 1987, embraced them all. By the time he introduced the slogan of Demokratizatsiya, Gorbachev had concluded that implementing his reforms outlined at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in February 1986 required more than discrediting the \\"Old Guard\\". He changed his strategy from trying to work through the CPSU as it existed and instead embraced a degree of political liberalization. In January 1987, he appealed over the heads of the party to the people and called for democratization. By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, it was clear that Gorbachev's reforms came with sweeping, unintended consequences, as nationalities of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union pulled harder than ever to break away from the Union and ultimately dismantle the Communist Party. Demokratizatsiya and Gorbachev's reform dilemma Gorbachev increasingly found himself caught between criticism by conservatives who wanted to stop reform and liberals who wanted to accelerate it. Meanwhile, despite his intention to maintain a one- party system, the elements of a multiparty system already were crystallising. Despite some setbacks, he continued his policy of Demokratizatsiya, and he enjoyed his worldwide perception as the reformer. In June 1988, at the CPSU's Nineteenth Party Conference, the first held since 1941, Gorbachev and his supporters launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. He again called for multicandidate elections for regional and local legislatures and party first secretaries and insisted on the separation of the government apparatus from party bodies at the regional level as well. In the face of an overwhelming majority of conservatives, Gorbachev still was able to rely on party obedience to the higher authorities to force through acceptance of his reform proposals. Experts called the conference a successful step in promoting party-directed change from above. At an unprecedented emergency Central Committee plenum called by Gorbachev in September 1988, three stalwart old-guard members left the Politburo or lost positions of power. Andrei Gromyko retired (had decided to retire before the meeting) from the Politburo, Yegor Ligachev was relieved of the ideology portfolio within the Politburo's Secretariat, and Boris Pugo replaced Politburo member Mikhail Solomentsev as chairman of the powerful CPSU Party Control Committee. The Supreme Soviet then elected Gorbachev chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, giving Gorbachev the attributes of power that previously Leonid Brezhnev had. These changes meant that the Secretariat, until that time solely responsible for the development and implementation of state policies, had lost much of its power. Meaningful changes also occurred in governmental structures. In December 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved formation of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, which constitutional amendments had established as the Soviet Union's new legislative body. The Supreme Soviet then dissolved itself. The amendments called for a smaller working body of 542 members, also called the Supreme Soviet, to be elected from the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies. To ensure a Communist majority in the new parliament, Gorbachev reserved one- third of the seats for the CPSU and other public organisations. The March 1989 election of the Congress of People's Deputies marked the first time that voters of the Soviet Union ever chose the membership of a national legislative body. The results of the election stunned the ruling elite. Throughout the country, voters crossed off the ballot unopposed Communist candidates, many of them prominent party officials, taking advantage of the nominal privilege of withholding approval of the listed candidates. However, the Congress of People's Deputies that emerged still contained 87 percent CPSU members. Genuine reformists won only some 300 seats. In May the initial session of the Congress of People's Deputies electrified the country. For two weeks on live television, deputies from around the country railed against every scandal and shortcoming of the Soviet system that could be identified. Speakers spared neither Gorbachev, the KGB, nor the military. Nevertheless, a conservative majority maintained control of the congress. Gorbachev was elected without opposition to the chairmanship of the new Supreme Soviet; then the Congress of People's Deputies elected a large majority of old-style party apparatchiks to fill the membership of its new legislative body. Outspoken opposition leader Yeltsin obtained a seat in the Supreme Soviet only when another deputy relinquished his position. The first Congress of People's Deputies was the last moment of real control for Gorbachev over the political life of the Soviet Union. In the summer of 1989, the first opposition bloc in the Congress of People's Deputies formed under the name of the Inter-Regional Group. The members of this body included almost all of the liberal and Russian nationalist members of the opposition led by Boris Yeltsin. A primary issue for the opposition was the repeal of Article 6 of the constitution, which prescribed the supremacy of the CPSU over all the institutions in society. Faced with opposition pressure for the repeal of Article 6 and needing allies against hard-liners in the CPSU, Gorbachev obtained the repeal of Article 6 by the February 1990 Central Committee plenum. Later that month, before the Supreme Soviet, he proposed the creation of a new office of president of the Soviet Union, for himself to be elected by the Congress of People's Deputies rather than the popular elections. Accordingly, in March 1990 Gorbachev was elected for the third time in eighteen months to a position equivalent to Soviet head of state. Former first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet Anatoly Lukyanov became chairman of the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet became similar to Western parliaments. Its debates were televised daily. By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, the CPSU was regarded by liberals and nationalists of the constituent republics as anachronistic and unable to lead the country. The CPSU branches in many of the fifteen Soviet republics began to split into large pro-sovereignty and pro- union factions, further weakening central party control. In a series of humiliations, the CPSU had been separated from the government and stripped of its leading role in society and its function in overseeing the national economy. However, the majority of its apparatchiks were successful in obtaining leading positions in the newly formed democratic institutions. For seventy years, the CPSU had been the cohesive force that kept the union together; without the authority of the party in the Soviet center, the nationalities of the constituent republics pulled harder than ever to break away from the union and to dismantle the party itself.

He coined the word and the concept of alebrije. Pedro Linares started as a skilled maker of carton Judas figures and figurines for Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and many other artists from the Academia de San Carlos. The art form of alebrijes was created by Pedro Linares after he became ill at 30 years old. His own unique alebrijes originated from a dream, depicting his death and rebirth in a mountainous setting inhabited by these fierce creatures. In 1936, while he was in bed, unconscious, Linares dreamt of a strange place resembling a forest. There were trees, animals, clouds, sky, rocks, etc.; he felt no pain and was very happy walking down there. Suddenly, rocks, clouds and animals turned into bizarre creatures; he saw a donkey with butterfly wings, a rooster with bull horns, a lion with an eagle head, and were shouting the word: \\"Alebrijes.\\" Every animal was shouting louder and louder: \\"Alebrijes, Alebrijes, Alebrijes!\\". The sound was terrible, and Linares was not able to stay there for long. He got a terrible headache and ran along a stone road where a man was walking. Linares asked the man for help as he wanted to escape. The man told him that he should not be here yet, and said that Linares had to walk by that road a few meters ahead for the exit. Linares ran until he was in front of a narrow window, passed through that window, and then woke up. Alebrije bird sculpture by Pedro Linares After his illness subsided, Linares gave life to his vision and the art of making alebrijes was born. He wanted his family and everyone to know about the animals he saw by taking a piece of paper and molding the figurines from his memory, then painting them as he saw them in his dream. Soon, Pedro Linares would be renowned as the best artisan in Mexico. Alebrije makers and artists popped up all over Mexico, taking inspiration from Pedro Linares' work. These figures are prized in Mexico and countries around the world. Diego Rivera stated that no one else could have fashioned the strange figures he requested. Work done by Linares for Diego Rivera is now displayed at the Anahuacalli Museum in Mexico City. \\"\\"Pedro Linares Lopez\\"\\" was awarded with 1990 National Prize for Arts and Sciences (Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes) in Popular Arts and Traditions category, the highest decoration to artisans granted by the Mexican Government. Two years later, in 1992 Pedro Linares Lopez died at the age of 86. His three children and later grandchildren kept the Linares name synonymous with the refined art of cartoner√≠a. Alebrijes continue to be produced by the Linares family and in other workshops across Mexico. They are exported to art galleries exhibiting Mexican art worldwide and are an excellent representation of Mexican talent.\\"En Calavera\\", Susan N Masuoka, UCLA References See also *Pedro Linares *Pedro Linares (Politico, Militar) 1906 births 1992 deaths People from Mexico City Mexican artisans ","title":"Pedro Linares"},{"id":"2956645","text":"Thutmose I, MET Museum, NYC The ancient Egyptian noble Userhet was buried in the Valley of the Kings, in tomb KV45.

The phenomenon is also referred to as anticipation or dynamic mutation. Background The paradox was named in the late 1980s after American geneticist Stephanie Sherman, who studied the inheritance patterns of people with fragile X syndrome. Sherman observed that the effects of fragile X syndrome seemed to occur more frequently with each passing generation. This observation became known as the Sherman paradox. The paradox was ultimately explained by insights into the mutation process that gives rise to the syndrome. Sherman theorized that the gene responsible for fragile X syndrome becomes mutated through a two-step process. The first mutation, called the 'premutation', doesn't cause any clinical symptoms. A second mutation was required to convert the 'premutation' into a 'full mutation' capable of causing the clinical symptoms associated with fragile X syndrome. Additionally, premutations must pass through females in order to transform into the full mutation. Fragile X syndrome is so named because of the appearance of the X chromosome in individuals with fragile X. Under an electron microscope, a region on the long arm of the chromosome resembles a thin string. Investigation showed that this region consists of a CGG repeat triplet in both normal and diseased individuals. The difference between normal and diseased is the length of the repeat; the repeat is longer where fragile X syndrome is present. When the length of the repeat surpasses a critical threshold, symptoms of the disorder appear and they increase in likelihood and severity with further length. Even below this threshold there is a range where the repeat becomes unstable during meiosis. In normal individuals, an insertion of extra CGGs is unlikely. However, as the length of the repeat increases, the probability of additional triplet insertions increases. When the expansion reaches the danger range, the carrier is still unaffected, but the risk of further mutation becomes significant. This is called the premutation range. Once the fragile X syndrome emerges, symptoms worsen from generation to generation because of the self-promoting aspect of the mutation. Triplet repeats and disease A similar mechanism, involving triplet repeats, underlies myotonic dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington's disease. In Huntington's disease, in contrast to fragile X, somatic as well as germline mutations occur. Autopsies of affected individuals reveal an accumulation of long repeats of CAG in DNA in the striatum. In both conditions, effects are less severe if the long repeat is interspersed with other triplets.

Alexander Laurie, first Presbyterian minister of nearby Portland, Victoria. It started as a 4-page, single broadsheet weekly in Gambierton, as Mount Gambier township was then known. John Watson (ca.1842 ‚Äì 13 December 1925) joined in 1863 as editor, and he and A. F. Laurie as publisher managed the company for the next 50 years. This article may be of interest to historians. Laurie was president of the Mount Gambier Racing Club from its inception and Watson was Mount Gambier's first mayor. Laurie and Watson founded The Narracoorte Herald in 1875, run initially by Archibald Caldwell and John Baxter Mather, and taken over in 1880 by Mather and George Ash. The newspaper went on to incorporate two rivals: the biweekly Mount Gambier Standard (3 May 1866 ‚Äì 1874), and the South Eastern Star (2 October 1877 ‚Äì 13 October 1930), which had been run by James Fletcher Jones. It also owned and printed the weekly newspaper The Pennant, which services Penola and district, and the South Eastern Times at Millicent. The newspaper was eventually bought by transport businessman, Alan Scott in 1977. In 2006, prominent editorial staff resigned or took leave due to the perceived interference of the newspaper's owner. Scott died in 2008 and the business remained in the family as part of The Border Watch Media Group (which also controlled The Pennant and the South Eastern Times). On 21 August 2020, as a result of losses due to the pandemic, all three newspapers were discontinued with the loss of 38 jobs. However, a revitalised The Border Watch later announced on 24 September that it would return to print, initially in a weekly format, from 16 October 2020. The new owner, TBW Today Pty Ltd, represents a partnership of independent newspaper owners from South Australia (i.e. Andrew Manuel of the Plains Producer), Victoria, and a Queensland media consultant.

In 1991, the school opened the aforementioned green unit to cater towards students with special needs/learning disabilities. Shortly after the Kuwait Liberation, the school was visited by Princess Anne.

This training is sometimes regulated and mandated by state and local laws, predominantly in North America, and increasingly in other English-speaking countries such as Australia. In some places, such as Australia, gaining such qualifications is required by law, before one can work to sell alcohol. The training can be used to mitigate liability during a lawsuit involving intoxication by providing evidence of intent on the part of the establishment that serves and sells alcoholic beverages ‚Äì a \\"reasonable efforts defense.\\" This training is intended to lower liquor liability insurance premiums, offer compliance with local laws and regulations, reduce penalties for alcohol violations, and is thought to prevent alcohol-related crimes such as property damage and assault. This training can be delivered in the classroom by certified trainers or via a web- based eLearning program. Most providers or states are able to offer either option. The training can be anywhere from 2 to 6 hours depending on the course content and provider. The majority of programs will have a certification attached to it where the participant is required to complete an assessment at the end of the training. In addition, many providers will offer unique programs for the variety of venues where alcohol is served, sold, or consumed. For example, an Off Premises location (grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores) may require unique training compared to an On Premises location (restaurants, bars, hotels, night clubs). The same is true for stadiums, arenas, amphitheatres, and casinos. Establishments that train their employees benefit by reducing risk and creating a safer, more responsible work environment. Effective training will enhance the fundamental people skills of servers, sellers, and consumers of alcohol. The training should help individuals understand the difference between people enjoying themselves and those who are getting into trouble with alcohol. Employees and managers who participate in this training are able to spot underage drinkers and prevent sales to minors, recognize signs of intoxication, effectively intervene to prevent problem situations, and handle refusal situations with greater confidence. Australia In Australia, Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) training is mandatory nationally for all people selling, offering or serving alcohol, including bar staff, sommeliers, waiting staff, and airline staff. In Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia this training is delivered by Registered Training Organisations as part of the nationally recognised unit of competency Provide responsible service of alcohol (SITHFAB002). In New South Wales and Victoria, state-specific training is delivered. Its primary purpose is harm minimization as set out in a by the Federal Government. Under this strategy, each state government is responsible for putting legislation and strategies in place to minimize the harm alcohol causes to various vulnerable groups in society including minors. One of the ways state governments are enabling this national strategy is through mandatory staff training. The type of training delivery allowed also varies between states, with states such as Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia and Northern Territory, accepting online delivery of the National RSA training, while Victoria does not currently recognise online as a valid delivery channel for this type of training. In July 2012 the New South Wales government introduced a trial of the NSW course online which was subsequently suspended in February 2014 until changes made to the \\"integrity of online certification\\". Debate continues as to the benefits of online training versus classroom training, with advocates claiming it delivers benefits such as more consistent and provides better access to rural learners to deliver the training online, while opponents argue that classroom training delivers better learning outcomes. NSW Update: OLGR NSW have approved a limited number of RTOs to deliver the RSA by email NSW RSA course by \\"Distance Learning\\". Regardless of the delivery channel, RSA training is generally founded on the concept of Duty of care and requires managers and staff to take all reasonable precautions to protect patrons and staff by preventing patrons from becoming disorderly and/or suffering alcohol intoxication. Other topics covered include blood alcohol content, the effects of alcohol on human health, a standard drink, how to serve responsibly and how to refuse service. =New South Wales= In New South Wales, the national training unit is accepted if provided by an RTO approved by Liquor & Gaming New South Wales, however following this training an RSA competency card issued by Service NSW must also be obtained within ninety days. =Queensland= In Queensland, the national training unit is accepted. The state previously had alternative training requirements, which were replaced by the national standard on 1 July 2013. =Victoria= In Victoria, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR) designs and regulates an independent RSA course. To retain currency, a VCGLR-operated online refresher course must be completed every three years. The VCGLR also operates an online bridging course for people holding interstate RSA qualifications, including the national training unit. Canada In Canada, alcohol server training is offered for those who serve alcohol and usually security staff and managers to complete relevant training in all provinces and territories. Training requirements and compliance depends on the provincial and territorial authorities who administer each course. The training in each province and territory differs depending on the liquor laws and has different names : Serving It Right (British Columbia), Proserve Program (Alberta), Serve it Right (Saskatchewan), Smart Choices (Manitoba), Smart Serve Ontario (Ontario), Service in Action (Quebec), It‚Äôs Good Business: Responsible Service of Alcohol (New Brunswick), It‚Äôs Good Business (Nova Scotia), It‚Äôs Our Business (Prince Edward Island), It‚Äôs Good Business: Responsible Service of Alcohol (Newfoundland and Labrador) and Be a Responsible Server (B.A.R.S) (Yukon) New Zealand In New Zealand, the Health Promotion Agency provides optional online training on server obligations under the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act. United States In the United States, this training is taught by a wide range of educational providers. The cost, quality and content of training varies widely from program to program, state to state, and even jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The term \\"alcohol server training\\", as a consequence, is often an umbrella attached to the overall intent of the training, if nothing else. This training usually carries some testing and certification, related to local state regulations, but other than the aforementioned few programs are provided nationally. Currently, there are 30 states and hundreds of local jurisdictions that regulate alcohol server training. Each state and jurisdiction regulate the training in different ways. Some will mandate training, meaning they approve and require specific training by law. Others will have voluntary training, which means they don't require the training by law but there are specific perks for completing an approved training course. The remainder are considered non-regulated, which means they do not regulate alcohol server training at all.
