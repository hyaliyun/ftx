Seapunk is a subculture that originated on Tumblr in 2011. It is associated with an aquatic-themed style of fashion, 3D net art, iconography, and allusions to popular culture of the 1990s. The advent of seapunk also spawned its own electronic music microgenre, featuring elements of Southern hip hop and pop music and R&B; music of the 1990s. Seapunk gained limited popularity as it spread through the Internet, although it was said to have developed a Chicago club scene. History Originally, seapunk started as a trend and an Internet meme on Tumblr in 2011. The term \\"seapunk\\" was coined by DJ Lil Internet in 2011, when he humorously wrote in a tweet on Twitter saying, \\"Seapunk leather jacket with barnacles where the studs used to be.\\" In December 2011, Cluster Mag reported on the emergence of seapunk in electronic media and quoted Pictureplane, who described seapunk as \\"a mostly Internet-based phenomenon birthed out of the Tumblr and Twitter universes as a means to describe a lifestyle aesthetic that is all things oceanic and of the sea.\\" Musical style Miles Raymer of the Chicago Reader described seapunk music as \\"a style of music that incorporates bits of 90s house, the past 15 years or so of pop and R&B; and the latest in southern trap rap‚Äîall overlaid with a twinkly, narcotic energy that recalls new-age music and chopped and screwed hip hop mix tapes in roughly equal measure.\\" According to The New York Times, seapunk music \\"constitutes a tiny music subgenre\\" that contains elements of witch house, chiptune, drum and bass and Southern rap. The New York Times also noted that some seapunk tracks remix songs from R&B; acts such as Beyonc√© and Aaliyah. In January 2012, an article about seapunk music was featured in the Dazed & Confused magazine. Katia Ganfield interviewed Lilium Kobayashi (a.k.a. Ultrademon) in the article, titled \\"Seapunk: A new club scene intent on riding sub-bass sound waves into the future\\". Seapunk was said to have developed a Chicago club scene. Notable seapunk artists include Azealia Banks, Grimes, Isaiah Toothtaker, Slava, Unicorn Kid. Fashion imagery Seapunks often wear bright green, blue, turquoise, cyan or aquamarine clothing, featuring nautical themes such as mermaids or dolphins, plastic Ray Ban wayfarers, shell jewelry, feathers, tartan overshirts associated with the surfer subculture, baseball caps, tie dye, transparent plastic jackets, and skipper caps. Symbols such as yin-yangs, smiley faces and references to the 1990s are also a part of the style. =Hair and makeup= Seapunks often dye their hair, and sometimes facial hair, with varying shades of turquoise, lilac, and sea blue. The seapunk styling was appropriated by several mainstream popular music and hip hop artists during the 2010s, most notably Kreayshawn, Nicki Minaj, Soulja Boy, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Azealia Banks, Rihanna, and Frank Ocean. Seapunk digital imagery and use of social networking media Images featuring neon flashing colors and rotating geometric shapes floating above oceans of brilliant blue or green water are found on the pages tagged with a #Seapunk hashtag on Tumblr. Seapunk digital imagery draws largely from 1990s 3D net art. The aforementioned imagery has given rise to other internet-based subgenres consisting of similar themes, such as slimepunk and icepunk. Rapper Azealia Banks used seapunk imagery in her \\"Atlantis\\" music video in 2012. Singer Rihanna was influenced by seapunk in her \\"Diamonds\\" performance on Saturday Night Live in 2012. Elements of seapunk imagery were claimed to have influenced designers such as Versace and Cartiergod's \\"Ocean Gang\\". In other media * Precursors to the seapunk aesthetic are evident in the post- apocalyptic Kevin Costner film Waterworld, the background graphics in the Sega Genesis game Ecco the Dolphin, the surfer gangs in Point Break with their shell jewelry, and the iridescent green and blue dresses worn by the mute mermaid Marina in Stingray.Jane WayneFrench seapunk See also * 2010s in fashion * Biopunk * Cyberpunk * Cyberpunk derivatives * Electronic dance music * Trendies * Vaporwave * Utopian and dystopian fiction * 1990s in music References Category:2010s fashion Category:Electronic dance music genres Category:Fashion aesthetics Category:Internet memes Category:Subcultures Category:Microgenres Category:Words coined in the 2010s Category:Vaporwave Category:2010s in music ","title":"Seapunk"},{"id":"35482983","text":"Bohu≈àov is the name of several locations in the Czech Republic: * Bohu≈àov (Svitavy District), a village in the Pardubice Region * Bohu≈àov (≈Ωƒè√°r nad S√°zavou District), a village in the Vysoƒçina Region ","title":"Bohu≈àov"},{"id":"35482998","text":"La Maison du Chocolat (\\"The House of Chocolate\\") is a French chain of chocolate boutiques that started in Paris and now runs stores around the world.

It questions the commonly held belief that the Allies wanted to avoid the war at all costs but were forced into action by Adolf Hitler's aggression. It consists largely of official government transcripts, newspaper articles, and other documents from the time, with Baker only occasionally interjecting commentary. Baker cites documents that suggest that the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom were provoking Germany and Japan into war and had ulterior motives for participating. He dedicates the book to American and British pacifists of the time who, he states in the book's epilogue, were right all along: ‚ÄúThey failed, but they were right.‚Äù'Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization' by Nicholson Baker - BOOK REVIEW - Los Angeles Times Reception The book had many negative reviews. Historian Noel Malcolm described it as a \\"strangely childish book\\" and journalist William Grimes in The New York Times as a \\"self-important, hand-wringing, moral mess of a book.\\" Christopher Hitchens accused Baker of ahistoricism and wrote that numerous passages in the book served as a reminder of how \\"fatuous the pacifist position can sound, or indeed can be.\\" Louis Menand wrote that each of Baker's themes is a \\"legitimate matter of debate\\" but criticized the selective use of primary sources as a \\"tabloid technique\\" of emotional manipulation. Piers Brendon criticized the book for misleading the reader by taking quotations and details out of context. Time magazine's review was also critical of Baker's style: \\"facts, even tragic ones, require context and interpretation. They don't speak for themselves. That's why we need historians.\\" British historian Dominic Sandbrook referred to the \\"mendaciousness, even fraudulence, of this extraordinarily self-righteous book\\" and contended that many of Baker's assertions, such as that Franklin Roosevelt conspired to provoke the Japanese into bombing Pearl Harbor, were not new and had been refuted long ago by scholarly historians. In a very harsh review, literary critic Adam Kirsch was especially critical of Baker's use of Nazi propaganda: \\"by reproducing Nazi language uncritically, Mr. Baker effectively endorses it. This is never more shocking than when he quotes Joseph Goebbels's description of Churchill.... A book that can adduce Goebbels as an authority in order to vilify Churchill has clearly lost touch with all moral and intellectual bearings. No one who knows about World War II will take Human Smoke at all seriously.\\" Conservative political commentator R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., awarded Human Smoke his J. Gordon Coogler Award for Worst Book of 2008.Tyrell, R. Emmett, Jr., \\"J. Gordon Coogler Award for 2008,\\" American Spectator; Volume 42, Number 2, March 2009 Other reviewers praised the book's use of documentary research as well as its intricate construction. Irish novelist Colm Toibin wrote in his New York Times review that \\"the issues Baker wishes to raise, and the stark system he has used to dramatize his point, make his book a serious and conscientious contribution to the debate about pacifism.\\" Tim Adams wrote a mixed review in The Guardian, stating, \\"What if we had all stood outside and waited for Hitler's raving to end and then gone on as before? It is a crucial question and one that has rarely been better articulated than in Human Smoke. But it invites an insistent supplementary, too: is it possible that by investing too much attention in detail, you always risk missing the bigger picture?\\" Pacifist Mark Kurlansky wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the book demonstrated that \\"World War II was one of the biggest, most carefully plotted lies in modern history\\" and that \\"people are going to get really angry at Baker for criticizing their favorite war. But he hasn't fashioned his tale from gossip. It is documented, with copious notes and attributions. The grace of these well-ordered snapshots is that there is no diatribe; you are left to put things together yourself. Human Smoke may be one of the most important books you will ever read.\\"Review, \\"Days of infamy 'Smoke' and mirrors,\\" Los Angeles Times March 9, 2008.

It is located in the parish of Dixton, in the ancient manor of Hadnock, and is accessed from the road between Wyesham and Staunton. The area is thinly populated. The main properties are Hadnock Court House, a Grade II listed building originating in the 17th century, and Little Hadnock, a small hamlet which is located a few hundred yards to the north-east.

The Monmouth Website: Is Monmouth Welsh or English?. Accessed 15 April 2012 =Early history= The Hadnock area, south of a bend in the River Wye, has been settled since at least Roman times. Excavations of a Roman villa in 1976 revealed a large complex of buildings, dating to the second and third centuries. Pottery from the site is predominantly from the 2nd to 4th centuries, but includes some native ware suggesting possible Iron Age settlement. There is also evidence of iron smelting and bronze working in the area in the Roman and mediaeval periods. The land was granted by Withenoc, lord of Monmouth, to Monmouth Priory, before being taken back by his son Baderon in exchange for three forges. John of Monmouth later endowed it to the hospital he founded in the town. A 14th century map shows a manor in the area, and the field pattern still shows evidence of a medieval open field system. There is also an ancient hollow way forming the eastern boundary of the Lady Grove wood, known locally as the Royal Road and thought to have been one of the main exits from the Royal Forest of Dean; it may follow the line of a Roman road. =Later history= After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the area became the seat of the Huntley family, later passing to the Herbert family. Charles Herbert of Hadnock was Member of Parliament for the Monmouth Boroughs in 1571. historyofparliamentonline.org: Charles Herbert of Hadnock.

He died in 1771, and the house and estate, known as Hadnock House, or Hadnock Hall, passed to his second son. In the early 19th century, the house was owned by Dr. Griffin and his wife. The house was said to have stood \\"on the brow of one of those projecting eminences which bound the Wye\\" and possessed \\"every charm that wood and water in their happiest distribution can bestow\\", with a \\"beautiful view of the river\\". After Dr. Griffin died without an heir, the Hadnock estate was purchased by Richard Blakemore in 1822. He demolished the original Hadnock House, and used the materials to rebuild and extend his property on the other side of the River Wye at Wyastone Leys. In 1825, all that was left of Hadnock House were some remains. In the 1860s, part of the Ross and Monmouth Railway, later a branch of the Great Western Railway, was built through the estate, with a halt at Hadnock.

He graduated from Salem High School in 1917, and that summer he began attending St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin. In the fall of 1918 he enrolled at Willamette University in Salem, but he had to interrupt his studies when his military reserve unit was called to Camp MacArthur in Waco, Texas for training.

Career In 1924, Barnes was hired by the New York Herald Tribune. His first foreign correspondent assignment was in Paris. While assigned to Paris, in 1926, he interviewed Gertrude Ederle upon the completion of her historic swim across the English Channel, and in 1927, he interviewed Charles Lindbergh after he completed the first solo transatlantic flight. In 1930, the Herald sent Barnes to Rome, where he reported on the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. In 1931, he became the paper's Moscow correspondent. He became known for reporting stories the Soviet regime did not want publicized, unlike Walter Duranty of The New York Times, who was sympathetic to the Soviet government. In 1935, Barnes transferred to Berlin, where he reported on the Nazi regime despite its censorship. After the German invasion of Poland, and the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, Barnes concluded that Germany would next attack the Soviet Union, despite the 1939 Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. The Nazi government expelled Barnes from Germany after the Tribune published the story. Death and legacy On November 17, 1940, on his way to cover Mussolini's invasion of Greece, Barnes was killed along with three Royal Air Force crew members when his plane crashed in Yugoslavia. Upon his death, reporters Leland Stowe of the Herald Tribune, William L. Shirer of Columbia Broadcasting, and William H. Stoneman of the Chicago Daily News saluted Barnes and his achievements. Barnes was the first war correspondent killed during World War II. In 1943, a Liberty ship was christened the SS Ralph Barnes in his honor.

Timur's death in 1405 marked the beginning of the end of his Empire, unified only by fear and blood of the subjected peoples. Turkomans, particularly the Kara Koyunlu clan, were among the first to rebel against Shah Rukh who ruled most of the Persia and Mawerannahr. Qara Yusuf, ruler of the Kara Koyunlu, defeated Shah Rukh, captured Baghdad, and repulsed Timurids from western Persia. After they established themselves as the new leading power in the middle east. They took advantage of the temporary weakness of Georgians and launched attacks against them, apparently in which, George VII of Georgia was killed. Constantine I of Georgia, fearing further encroachment, allied himself with the Shirvanshah Ibrahim I to counter Turkoman advance and engaged them in the Battle of Chalagan, in which he was defeated and taken captive. In captivity Constantine behaved very proudly, which infuriated Qara Yusuf to such an extent, that he ordered his, his half-brother David's and 300 Georgian nobles' execution. Alexander I of Georgia who sought to strengthen and restore his declining Kingdom, faced constant invasions by the tribal Turkomans. They sacked Akhaltsikhe, city of the vital regional importance in 1416, in response of suggested oppression of Muslims. Alexander re-conquered Lorri from the Turkomans in 1431, which was of great importance in securing of the Georgian borders. Around 1434/5, Alexander encouraged the Armenian prince Beshken II Orbelian to attack the Kara Koyunlu clansmen in Siunia and, for his victory, granted him Lorri under terms of vassalage. In 1440, Alexander refused to pay tribute to Jahan Shah of the Kara Koyunlu. In March, Jahan Shah surged into Georgia with 20,000 troops, destroyed the city of Samshvilde and sacked the capital city Tbilisi. He massacred thousands of Christians, put heavy indemnity on Georgia, and returned to Tabriz. He also mounted a second military expedition against Georgia in 1444. His forces met those of Alexander‚Äôs successor, King Vakhtang IV at Akhaltsikhe, but the fighting was inconclusive and Jahan Shah returned to Tabriz once more. As a result of foreign and internal struggles unified Kingdom of Georgia stopped to exist after 1466 and was subdivided into several political units. Kara Koyunlu tribal confederation was destroyed by Aq Qoyunlu, their kin tribesmen who formed another confederation, which was similar in many ways to its predecessor. Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans naturally took advantage of the Georgian fragmentation. Georgia was at least twice attacked by Uzun Hasan, the prince of the Aq Qoyunlu in 1466, 1472 and possibly 1476-7. Bagrat VI of Georgia, temporary ruler of most of Georgia at the time, had to make peace with the invaders, abandoning Tbilisi to the enemy. It was only after Uzun Hasan‚Äôs death (1478) when the Georgians were able to recover their capital. In the winter of 1488, the Ak Koyunlu Turkomans led by Halil Bey attacked Georgia‚Äôs capital Tbilisi, and took the city after a long-lasted siege in February 1489. Alexander II of Imereti, another pretender to the throne, took advantage of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkoman invasion of Kartli, and seized control of Imereti. Occupation of the capital did not last long and Constantine II of Georgia was able to repel them, but it was still costly to Georgians. Ismail I, founder of the Safavid dynasty, formed an alliance with the Georgians in 1502 and decisively defeated Aq Qoyunlu in the same year, destroying their state and marking the end of their invasions.

His illustrated works have been preserved and displayed within many museum and library exhibits. The three largest collections are within the Polish American Museum located in Port Washington, New York, USA at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, and also at the University of Minnesota in the Immigration History Research Center. He is survived by his only son, Jan. Early life Archacki was born in a very small village located approximately 50 miles North of Warsaw, Poland known as Pieczyska. In 1907, the same year Henry was born, his father, Jozef, left Poland for the American Mid-Western city of Chicago. His mother, Bronis≈Çawa, followed suit in 1908 with her young child. He was described as, \\"show[ing] an early proclivity for using a pencil, both artistically and literally.\\" In America In his teens, the artist attended Carl Schurz High School in Chicago. After he obtained his degree, he began writing for Chicago's Dziennik ZwiƒÖzkowy (Alliance Daily News), focusing on its youth and sports pages. He was also hired as a graphic artist by the Republic Engraving and Design Company. In November 1930 he moved to Brooklyn, New York to run the company's studio there. Shortly thereafter, he met his future wife, Janina (n√©e Wijacka) Wycka. In just a few years the company was forced out of business due to the depressed economy. In response, Archacki rented a loft near Union Square and created his own graphic design firm, Pioneer Rubber and Engraving Company making ends meet by drawing up advertising, making stamps, drawing murals, and illustrating cartoons. \\"Czy wiecie, ≈ºe‚Ä¶\\"; His cartoons In the spirit of making ends meet during the Great Depression of the 1930s, Archacki began illustrating a cartoon strip entitled \\"Czy wiecie, ≈ºe‚Ä¶\\" (\\"Do you know that‚Ä¶\\") in 1931. The cartoons, pertaining to the artistic styling known as \\"factoid comics\\" depict everything from poetry to boxing in the US and Poland. According to the UB libraries, his cartoons mixed serious and light content, both enlightening and entertaining Archacki's beloved Polonia. Essentially, they were illustrations of Polish oddities patterned after Robert Ripley's \\"Believe it or Not!\\" a syndicated newspaper feature. The cartoons were fairly popular as they appealed to the United States' Polonia during the evolution of one of Poland's most stressful times in history; when the nation was independent, then occupied by the German Nazi regime, and then part of the Soviet bloc. Many Polish newspapers around the United States purchased them for print, including the American Polonia Reporter as well as the Polish American Journal. Within the span of his career he was thought to have printed close to 3,000 cartoons accompanied by Polish text. This earned him the nickname of \\"the Polish Ripley.\\" Many of Archacki's cartoons have been preserved and digitized by the University at Buffalo Libraries. The Archacki Cartoon Collection includes cartoons that span a 20-year period from 1931‚Äì1952. The cartoons were originally clipped, saved and scrapbooked by an unknown subscriber of Dziennik dla Wszystkich (Everybody's Daily), a Polish-language newspaper published in Buffalo, New York, during the mid-20th century. The scrapbooks were later acquired by Steven Piwowar, a member of Buffalo's Polish community, and subsequently donated to the University at Buffalo Libraries' Polish Room Jean Dickson, former curator of the University at Buffalo Libraries Polish Collection, describes the Archacki Cartoon Collection as \\"a window that reveals Polish Americans in the 1930s and 1940s, both as assimilating citizens of the United States as well as proud inheritors of Polish culture and history. The artist sought to educate and amuse Polish Americans. While many of these cartoons are available in microfilm within specific newspapers, there is no site where they have been collected and made available to the general public online.\\" The University at Buffalo Libraries received written permission from Jan Archacki, the son and sole heir of Henryk Archacki, to digitize, preserve and present his father's cartoons. Currently, 201 cartoons are available in the Archacki Cartoon Collection. The remaining cartoons will be added to the digital collection as funds become available. Progress during the depression Alongside writing and illustrating his popular cartoon strips, Archacki quickly rose to prominence in other Polish-American niches. Additionally in 1931, he became the official sports editor of a literary magazine called The Poland, and later on as the same position for the Nowy Swiat.

History The history of competitive athletics in Hungary dates back to 1875, when the Magyar Athletikai Club (MAC) was founded and organized the first public athletics event in the country. MAC continued to hold compeititons in the next decades, and with the growing popularity of the sport they were joined by newly founded clubs which had their own contests and gave out the Hungarian champion title. These, however, were not officially recognized national championships yet and the rules were also not standardized. The turning point came in 1896, when Hungary celebrated its millennium and as part of the Millenary Feast sports events of great dimensions were held in Budapest in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph I, attracting over 5,000 athletes. The competition turned out to be a complete success, which gave a big boost to the athletics. A year later, on 21 March 1897 the Hungarian Athletics Association (HAA) was created and two races of the 1896 championship ‚Äì the 100 yard and the 1 mile event ‚Äì were approved as official competitions, making Alajos Szokolyi and Franti≈°ek Horn the first Hungarian Athletics Championships winners, respectively. Adding long jump and shot put in 1897, and 120 yard hurdles and 440 yard in 1901 to the events' list, MAC continued to organize the championships until 1903, subsequently taken over by the HAA.

Both of these towns are located in the most southern point of the Alicante province in the southeast of Spain and therefore shares a border with the province of Murcia. The name of the town has its origin in two factors: the first, the 16th century watchtower; and the second, the site where the tower is found: the point of Horadada (el horadada) which comes from the Spanish word for \\"bore through\\" as it is situated on rocks made up of small caves developed by the water boring the rock.  Historical values  In ancient times, the Mediterranean coast and specifically the Horadada fields suffered many pirate raids. In order to prevent this, Phillip II had a series of watchtowers built along the coast, so that they could alert villagers about the presence of pirate ships. The Horadada tower was built in 1591, although there are traces of the existence of similar constructions from ancient times and the Middle Ages. From 1905 until the present day it has been property of the counts of Roche, who transformed it into their summer residence. During the 19th century the tower was used to make signals with an optical telegraph. In December 1995 it was registered as a property of cultural significance within Spain‚Äôs Historical Heritage as a monument.  Natural values  Enthusiasts can enjoy diving and snorkeling along Torre‚Äôs shores full of sea life. Along the coast you can find great sand banks combined with small rock formations full of marine diversity and posidonia sea grass ensuring an interesting diving experience.  Present day  As a coastal town it has experienced a great deal of its fortune thanks to tourism and boasts various prestigious blue flag beaches, the most popular being Los Jesuitas, El Conde, and El Puerto. These local beaches are well known for their fine sand and crystal waters. Its popularity during the busy summer months means that the town‚Äôs population can quadruple in size with many visitors coming from other parts of Spain, mainly Madrid and Murcia to enjoy their summer residences. In recent years Torre de la Horadada has become the home to many expatriate residents form northern Europe, mainly from the UK and Ireland. This has led to the all year round sustainability of the town, which has resulted in the advent of new local business and amenities such as supermarkets, bars, restaurants and the construction of a new, and modern tourism complex Lo Monte. During the Spanish boom years of the first decade of the 21st century Torre like many other Spanish coastal towns saw an increase in the construction of homes, however in contrast to most other local towns this expansion was characterized for being steady and controlled which has safeguarded its appearance and the wellbeing of its residents. As a result, Torre has bucked the national trend for the demand of housing and still continues to have a number of construction projects currently in place, and although house prices have significantly reduced compared to the boom years they still favor considerably in relation to the national trend.  Amenities  Although it‚Äôs a small coastal town Torre boasts various local services such as a medical center, supermarkets and two main plazas, ‚ÄúPueblo Latino‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Square‚Äù home to a great variety of bars, restaurants and ice cream parlors meaning that all tastes and budgets are catered for. The town is also home to a small marina of 525 moorings, which was built on a small fishing dock more than 30 years ago and has recently been a point of conflict between residents and authorities due to a proposed expansion of the port, which would endanger certain aspects of the environment as well as a negative visual impact. As of June 2011 Torre is now home to a modest modern tourism complex, Lo Monte, which has three swimming pools, a gym and spa, and a bar/restaurant which provides local delicacies as well as international cuisine to both tourists and local residents. All the facilities are managed with the maximum respect for the environment and are adapted for children and disabled people. This complex adds to the touristic viability of the town, offering cozy wooden bungalows as well as plots to rent. Also there is a Guardia Civil barracks located next to the famous watchtower from which the town takes its name.

They are dominated by the Taxodium spp., either the bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), or pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens). The name comes from the dome-like shape of treetops, formed by smaller trees growing on the edge where the water is shallow while taller trees grow at the center in deeper water. They usually appear as circular, but if the center is too deep, they can form a ‚Äúdoughnut‚Äù shape when viewed from above. Cypress domes are characteristically small compared to other swamps, however they can occur at a range of sizes, dependent on the depth.A cypress dome in the background Cypress domes form when pond cypress grow in shallow standing water. The ground level in the center of the dome may be several inches to a few feet lower than at the edge of the dome, but tree growth is more vigorous at the center of the dome. Thus, the treetops are higher at the center than at the edge of the dome.  Range  Cypress domes are found in the southeastern region of the United States. They form in flatland depressions in the Gulf coastal plain and southern Atlantic coastal plain, in the states of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Southern coastal plain nonriverine cypress domes are found throughout the southern coastal plains. Cypress domes are the most common swamp habitat in Florida. Most abundant in Central Florida, they also occur in other areas of Florida north of the Florida Keys. South Florida cypress domes are found in southern Florida, in particular in and around the Everglades and the Big Cypress National Preserve. They are distinguished from southern coastal plain cypress domes by the presence of tropical understory species.  Hydrology  The water levels of dome swamps are naturally fluctuating and dependent on seasonal rainfall. Dome swamps derive most of their water through runoff from surrounding uplands. They also may be influenced by groundwater when they are directly connected to the aquifer. Groundwater particularly impacts the hydrology during periods of drought. Dome swamps can recharge the aquifers, acting as reservoirs. The average hydroperiod for a dome swamp is approximately 180 to 270 days per year. The water is deepest and remains the longest in the center of the dome. Prolonged dry and wet periods have a huge effect on cypress regeneration. Adult cypress trees are tolerant to extended periods of inundation, however their seeds cannot germinate under water and may not survive.  Fire dependency  Cypress swamps occur in fire maintained communities. Fire is essential for maintaining the structure and species composition in these communities. Without periodic fires, cypress may become less dominant. Cypress are tolerant to light surface fires, due to their thick, fire-resistant bark. Surface fires act as a mechanism to remove potential competitors without tolerance and resilience to fires. However, catastrophic fires that burn into the peat can be detrimental to cypress trees, especially when there has been a long period with no fires. Catastrophic wildfires can alter the ground surface and transform a dome swamp into other types of wetlands, such as a wet prairie or shrub bog. Fire frequency is greatest along the edge of the dome and least moving inwards. Along the edge, the normal fire period may be three to five years, whereas the center may be as long as 100 to 150 years. Due to cypress domes having a more variable hydroperiod, cypress domes tend to have more natural fires than larger cypress forests. Fire patterns impact the quality of ecological services provided by cypress domes, for example carbon storage and hydrologic storage. List of species = Flora = Plant species that occur in cypress domes include: ; Herbaceous species * toothed midsorus fern (Blechnum serrulatum) * false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrica) * sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) * Carolina redroot (Lachnanthes caroliana) * taperleaf waterhorehound (Lycopus rubellus) * maidencane (Panicum hemitomon) * knotweeds (Polygonum spp.) * beaksedge (Rhynchospora spp.) * lizard's tail (Saururus cernuus) * cinnamon fern (Osmunda cinnamomea) * royal fern (Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis) * Virginia chain fern (Woodwardia virginica) ; Miscellaneous species * duckweeds (Lemna, Spirodela, and Landoltia) * big floatingheart (Nymphoides aquatica) * orchids (Orchidaceae spp.) * bulltongue arrowhead (Sagittaria lancifolia) * floating water spangles (Salvinia minima) * sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) * alligatorflag (Thalia geniculata) * wild pine (Tillandsia spp.) ; Shrubs (uncommon) *common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) *titi (Cyrilla racemiflora) *St. John's wort (Hypericum spp.) *Virginia willow (Itea virginica) *fetterbush (Lyonia lucida) *wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera) *coastalplain willow (Salix caroliniana) ; Trees *red maple (Acer rubrum) *pond apple (Annona glabra, South Florida) *Coco plum (Chrysobalanus icaco, South Florida) *loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus) *dahoon (Ilex cassine) *sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) *swamp bay (Persea palustris) *slash pine (Pinus elliottii) ; Vines *white twinevine (Sarcostemma clausum) *laurel greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia) *Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) *poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) Cypress dome with Alligator - G.Gardner = Fauna = Dome swamps provide breeding habitat for rare animals such as flatwoods salamanders (Ambystoma spp.), white ibis (Eudocimus albus), and wood storks (Mycteria americana). Other species include: * Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) * Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) * Florida sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis pratensis) * American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) * Cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) * Striped newt (Notophthalmus perstriatus) * Carolina gopher frog (Lithobates capito) * Ornate chorus frog (Pseudacris ornata) * Similar cebrionid beetle (Selonodon similis)  Threats  The major threat to cypress swamps are humans. Anthropogenic alterations have negative impacts including hydrological modifications, logging, increased nutrients, pollution from agricultural runoff, and invasion of exotic species. Conversion of surrounding lands to urban development, pastures, and agriculture can impede natural fires and changes the hydrology. Changing the hydroperiods of cypress domes may limit reproduction of natural species and increase likelihood of invasive species. Invasive species threaten native species through competition for light, nutrients, and space. Dome swamps have been used as a timber resource since the late 19th century. The rapid harvesting of cypress trees has made it difficult for them to regenerate and made them especially vulnerable. In addition, dome swamps are used as areas to treat wastewater. This can cause increased nutrients, organic matter, and minerals to enter the swamp. This can increase aquatic plants, decrease oxygen in the water, and cause declines in native populations. Dome swamps treated with sewage may have higher water levels and litter production.

Muriel Coben was one of the 57 players born in Canada to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history. She also became one of the original 60 founding members of the league in its 1943 inaugural season. Coben has been considered by researchers as the greatest softball pitcher of her era in Saskatchewan history. She led her teams to numerous regional, provincial and national championships in Canada in a career that lasted 18 years. In addition, she was a member of a Canadian women's curling champion team and has been enshrined in several Hall of Fames in recognition of her outstanding contribution to Canadian sport.Saskatchewan Sports: Lives Past and Present ‚Äì Holden Stoffel.

Born in Gelert, Ontario, Coben was raised on a farm in Tessier, Saskatchewan.Saskatchewan Sports She started her pitching career in 1936, winning all her games as a member of the hometown Tessier Millionaires. She later played from 1938 to 1942 in Saskatoon for the Pats team, where she aroused the attention of an AAGPBL scout who signed her a contract to play in the new league during the opening 1943 season. Coben tried to make the adjustment to the AAGPBL's rules of play, but returned home after one year of struggling. Unfortunately, she suffered one of the worst pitching performances of the year, after posting a combined 4-16 record with the South Bend Blue Sox and Rockford Peaches, while leading the league for the most earned runs allowed (102).All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.C.

Format: Hardcover, 294pp. She returned to the Saskatoon Pats in 1944, pitching for them two years before joining the Saskatoon Grey Cab Rambler from 1946 through 1950. In this period, Coben helped the team win three successive Saskatchewan championships (1946‚Äì1948) and two Western Canadian championships (1946‚Äì1947). In 1950 she moved to Edmonton, where she joined the Mortons ball club and aided them in winning the Canadian championship over a very strong Toronto squad in 1952. She then returned to Saskatoon, and again starred with the Ramblers until her playing days were over in 1953. After retiring from softball, Coben took up curling with the Saskatchewan senior ladies, playing lead for the Joyce McKee's rink that won the 1960 national women's curling championship after defeat the Quebec squad in two matches, 11‚Äì3 and 8‚Äì5.

It is believed to be the second oldest operating movie house in the city and one of the oldest continually operating cinemas in the United States. The theater was designed by Charles A. Duke in 1913, built in 1914, and opened as The Clinton in 1915. It became known as the 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a resemblance of its original name in 1976. The Clinton often screens grindhouse, cult and experimental films, and has become known for hosting regular screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (since 1978, marking one of the film's longest-running showings) and Repo! The Genetic Opera. The venue also hosts the annual Filmed by Bike festival, the Faux Film Festival and the Portland Queer Documentary Film Festival. History A photograph of the building that was to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a pressed brick front and walls with hollow tiles. The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, the first in a continuing series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1. The 300-seat theater was designed by Charles A. Duke in 1913 and opened in 1915 as The Clinton. Its main entrance faced 26th Avenue until 1922. The venue became known as the 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a variation of its original name on May 30, 1975. At that time, a five-person collective bought the theater. The collective consisted of Jim Blashfield, Joe Uris, Lenny Diener, David Lifton and others. The group also published the Clinton St. Quarterly, with poetry by Walt Curtis and cartoons by John Callahan.Michael Kelsey, The Southeast Examiner, \\"Clinton Street Theatre turns 100\\" 2/1/2013 The movie house had been showing X-rated films, which the collective replaced with a wide variety of movies including foreign films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and older films like The African Queen. The theater in 2010 In September 1999, Elizabeth Rozier and Dennis Nyback took over operation of the theater. Nyback had previously shown films at the Clinton beginning in 1997. He was told about the availability of the theater when he was showing films in June 1999. During his time operating the theater with Rozier, Clinton showed a mix of new films, revival films, and creations by Nyback using his archive. His shows included: \\"Defining the 1970's Through Classic Commercials\\", \\"Bad Bugs Bunny\\", \\"Strange and Surreal Industrial Films\\", \\"F&#k Mickey Mouse\\", \\"Scopitone A Go Go\\", \\"Jazz on Film\\", \\"The Dark Side of Dr. Seuss\\", \\"Forty Years of Classic Commercials\\", and \\"The Genius of Bob Clampett\\". Seth and Nicola Sonstein purchased the business from Elizabeth Rozier in September 2003. The couple \\"fell in love with both the city and the theater\\" after visiting in July 2002 as coordinators of San Francisco's Sick Puppy short film festival. The Sonsteins added heating and air conditioning, both firsts for the theater, and refurbished the bathrooms, lobby and walls, among other upgrades. Screening independent films and supporting local filmmakers remain the couple's primary goals. In March 2012 the business, including fixtures and projection and concession equipment, but not the building itself, were listed for sale. In April 2012 ownership of the business transferred from the Sonsteins to Roger and Lani Jo Leigh. After the sale, Seth Sonstein said in a press release: \\"For the last eight-and-a-half years I have had the opportunity to run the coolest movie theater, in the coolest neighborhood, in the coolest city in America. My eternal gratitude goes out to the citizens of Portland. I can never say thank you enough times for all of the support you have given to the Clinton.\\" Events to mark the change included an open house \\"meet-and-greet\\", which included screenings of two documentary films by Lani Jo, and an evening of rare trailers and video clips from the Prelinger Archives. Lani Jo confirmed the theater will continue to offer screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and focus on documentary and independent films. Events Members of the Clinton Street Cabaret, who present The Rocky Horror Picture Show, walking in Portland's Pride Parade in 2014 Clinton Street Theater offers: \\"a mixture of grindhouse, music films, political documentaries and experimental films\\". The theater has become known for its weekly screenings of Rocky Horror and Repo! The Genetic Opera, and for its annual Filmed by Bike festival, which began in 2003 and features: \\"bike- themed independent short movies from around the world.\\"Sources for Filmed by Bike:  * Rocky Horror screenings began in 1978, marking one of the longest-running showings of the film. The theater also hosts the Faux Film Festival, offering cult and independent film showings, and the Portland Queer Documentary Film Festival. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Portland Trail Blazers, in 2009 the theater screened the 1978 rare and out of circulation documentary Fast Break about the team's 1976‚Äì77 championship season. In 2010 the Clinton hosted the Three-Minute Picture Show, which featured screenings of three-minute films by first-time filmmakers. The venue has also hosted benefit events, such as \\"Can't Stop the Serenity\\" (presented by PDX Browncoats), which included showings of the film Serenity among other features to benefit Equality Now and the Oregon Food Bank. Other hosted events have included the Portland Underground Film Festival, comedy shows, commemorations for holidays such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and lectures on film making. Many celebrities have appeared at the theater to promote films, including Crispin Glover in 2008, and Bill Plympton and Tom Shadyac in 2011. Chuck Palahniuk, Tom Potter and Gus Van Sant have also appeared at the theater.

Their songs are part autobiography and part psychogeography. Having come together to make an album that imagined the landscape, legends and people of Gawain Erland Cooper's birthplace, Orkney (2012‚Äôs highly acclaimed Orkney: Symphony of the Magnetic North), and originally intending to be a one-off, their popularity led them to reconvene to release follow-up Prospect of Skelmersdale in 2016 - evoking childhood memory, people and place, and an examination of how a failing Northern new town became home to the transcendental meditation movement. If Orkney was the musical equivalent of great nature writing then Prospect of Skelmersdale is somewhere between finely-tuned kitchen-sink drama and urban psychogeography. Inspired as much by the greys and greens of Kes, as the soothing, cyclical patterns of meditative ragas, Prospect of Skelmersdale is a collection of musical snapshots of a uniquely British town. It is a concept album about Tong's Transcendentalist hometown, Skelmersdale. In an interview with Transverso Media he described it as, \\"a series of little snapshots that I had drawn from my memory of people and places,\\" stating it's, \\"kind of about where I grew up.

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 26, 2012. \\"Fundraiser\\" was written by Owen Ellickson and directed by David Rogers. The episode guest stars Andy Buckley and Jack Coleman. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) crashes a fundraiser and ends up adopting twelve dogs. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) learns that an auction winner loses money. Nellie (Catherine Tate) learns how to eat a taco. \\"Fundraiser\\" received mixed reviews from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Fundraiser\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.17 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, making it the lowest-rated season eight episode of The Office to air. The episode ranked third in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Angela Lipton's (Angela Kinsey) husband Robert (Jack Coleman) throws a silent auction fundraiser for local animal rights activists and Robert California (James Spader) buys two tables to seat everyone in the office. Newly fired Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) arrives and tries to get into an argument with Robert, telling him about a rock opera he has written with the hero based on Andy and the villain being a heartless character who wants to destroy all music named Thomas Oregon (with the name being a thinly-veiled reference to Robert California), who is \\"humanized\\" when he pees himself at the end. Andy runs into David Wallace (Andy Buckley), former CFO of Dunder Mifflin, and begins plotting his return to Dunder Mifflin. Andy interrupts Robert's speech introducing the senator by volunteering to adopt the twelve dogs brought by the local animal society. Afterwards, members of the office ask if he is having a breakdown, and, at Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner)'s urging, Andy sadly agrees that he is. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) attends without understanding how silent auctions work: he believes that the purpose of the function is to guess correctly the market price of the objects. By the end of the night, Dwight has put exorbitant amounts on the items and ends up accidentally donating over $34,000. He flees when he discovers his mistake, giving a bizarre speech on the value of animals before doing so. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tries to talk with Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) by complaining about the food. She suggests they get a taco at her expense, offering thirty dollars to Darryl to go out and buy some. When she does, she shovels the ingredients in her mouth, not eating the shell. Darryl realizes she has no idea what a taco is, but appreciates that \\"she's trying\\" to socialize with her employees. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) talks briefly to Senator Lipton about animal rights, and Lipton (who Oscar suspects is gay) gives Oscar his private cell phone number, asking Oscar to call him in the evening to discuss issues further. Oscar tells Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that the Senator was hitting on him. Jim says Lipton was likely just schmoozing a voter, talks to Lipton himself, and also gets his number. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) later gets Lipton's number as well, resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator may not have been hitting on him. When Oscar is leaving, Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him. Production \\"Fundraiser\\" was written by Owen Ellickson and directed by David Rogers. The episode features the return of the character David Wallace (Andy Buckley), former CFO of Dunder Mifflin. Wallace, who is also attending the fundraiser, reveals to Andy that after his firing, he sold his toy-vacuum invention \\"Suck It\\" to the military for $20 million. Cultural references The cold opening references several notable bands and musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard‚Äîerroneously‚Äîthat musician Smokey Robinson died. Initially, Ryan refers to him as only \\"Smokey\\", which causes Pam to believe he is talking about Smokey the Bear. However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson had sung, \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\". Pam, however, is later able to remember that he sang \\"Tears of a Clown\\", and Jim references \\"I Second That Emotion\\". After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue, Ryan tells him that he will be unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka, and that is \\"not what Smokey would have‚Ä¶ does want!\\" During his pontificating rant, Ryan mentions that popular music is not all about \\"Jason Mraz and The Beatles\\", which shocks Dwight. Dwight lists off \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Paperback Writer\\" and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs. Reception =Ratings= \\"Fundraiser\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 26, 2012. The episode was viewed by an estimated 4.17 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode finished third in its time slot, being beaten by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.2 rating/8% share and the CBS drama Person of Interest which received a 2.4 rating/6% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode beat the Fox series Touch and The CW drama series The Secret Circle. Despite this, \\"Fundraiser\\" was the highest-rated NBC television episode of the night. The episode was the 25th most watched episode in the 18‚Äì49 demographic for the week ending April 29. =Reviews= Several reviews wrote positively about the return cameo of Andy Buckley. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review and gave it a B- rating. He wrote, \\"The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there‚Äôs a certain charm to it.\\" McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of \\"Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco\\" was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they \\"could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco.\\" Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, \\"For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on. Whether the stuff that‚Äôs happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate, but I actually enjoyed most of this episode.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Forcella noted \\"It has been four episodes now since the super team returned from Florida, and The Office still hasn't found its footing back in Scranton\\", and he called the outing \\"another lackluster effort\\". A review from CliqueClack was largely critical of the episode, calling it \\"worse than usual\\" and noting that the show had finally hit \\"rock bottom\\". WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer felt that the episode's setting‚Äîoutside of the office building‚Äîwas detrimental to the episode. He wrote, \\"The thing is, I in no way felt like any of what occurred in 'Fundraiser' needed to take place outside the Scranton branch and that‚Äôs really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode ‚Äì because the story couldn't function without it. But this time it just felt like a cheap way to liven up a clearly very boring, uninspired, weak episode of television.\\" Screen Crave wrote, \\"Those viewers of The Office that have scolded the show throughout the season for its varying degrees of sucking, are not likely to be changing their thinking after watching the latest episode.\\" However, many reviews were happy about the return of Andy Buckley, who portrayed David Wallace. A review from TV Equals noted that \\"I‚Äôm not totally convinced that David Wallace‚Äôs story is as simple as the one he tells, but maybe that‚Äôs just because I‚Äôd love any excuse for him to work his way back into the story lines for The Office.\\" Michael Tedder from Vulture called Wallace's character \\"always-welcome\\".

It was discovered in 1955 at the Butantan Institute, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, by Gast√£o Rosenfeld and collaborators. Mechanism of Action Hementerin is a protease, i.e., it carries out an enzymatic cleaving of a plasma protein involved in rapid blood coagulation called fibrinogen. The absence of a significant amount of plasma fibrinogen retards coagulation, thus it is a naturally occurring anticoagulant. Hementerin breaks the alpha (FGA), gamma (FGG) and beta (FGB) chains, by degrading cross-linked fibrin. It has no degrading action on amide, plasminogen and casein. In addition, hementerin inhibits platelet aggregation induced by collagen via the activation of a nitridergic pathway. Inhibition is probably achieved by enhanced nitric oxide synthase activity. Calcium is a cofactor (ligand) in this activity. The fibrinolytic activity is inhibited by EDTA, a metal chelator agent, which removes zinc from the molecule. Molecular Composition Hementerin is an 80 kDa protein. A fragment of 30 aminoacids of its N-terminal sequence is known: XTLSEPEPTC SIEYFRYQAI EDCEYSISVK. References * Hementerin. UNIPROT.

It has mining activities in Kovdor, Murmansk Oblast, Russia, and in Kazakhstan, as well as oil and gas operations in Novy Urengoy, Yamalo- Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia. The company's production facilities are located in Russia, Belgium and Lithuania. According to the company, it is the largest producer of mineral fertilizers and ranks among the top three European and top ten global producers by both nutrient capacity and profitability. In 2013 EuroChem had revenues of US$5.6bn, of which nitrogen US$3.2bn and phosphate US$1.8bn.  Assets  EuroChem produces primarily nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, as well as certain organic synthesis products and iron ore. It moved its headquarters to Zug, Switzerland, in 2014 and operates production facilities in Russia and Western Europe and employs more than 20,000 employees globally.

Melnichenko also has a large stake in Russian coal producer SUEK. Business = Acquisitions = Murmansk Commercial Sea Port On 24 April 2013 EuroChem finalised the acquisition of a 47.67% interest in the share capital of OJSC \\"Murmansk Commercial Seaport\\" represented by 53,943 voting shares for 3,113,859,000. The Group made a prepayment of 2,522,755,000 for the acquisition of a 38.62% interest representing 43,703 voting shares in December 2012 and in April 2013 additionally acquired a 9.05%, interest representing 10,240 voting shares, for 591,104,000. Russian Financial Control Monitor on 26 April 2013 quoted EuroChem's CEO who commented on the transaction and said that \\"the price is comparable to recent privatisation deals of similar assets and the purchase was made in the open market\\". The privatisations of the port began in late 2012, with SUEK ‚Äì a mining company controlled by Andrey Melnichenko ‚Äì acquiring a 24.95% stake. At the beginning of April 2013 it purchased a further 24.91% increasing its stake to 49.86%. As a result of EuroChem's acquisition the two companies controlled by Melnichenko own 97.53% of the Murmansk port. On 26 April 2013 the Russian information agency Interfax reported that EuroChem plans to make a mandatory offer to purchase the remaining shares from minority shareholders thus becoming a majority owner of the port. EuroChem Agro (K+S Nitrogen) In July 2012, EuroChem completed the acquisition of K+S Nitrogen, a company marketing nitrogenous fertilizers with a focus on major customers in agriculture and special crops such as fruits, vegetables and grapes. In addition to the fertilizers produced by EuroChem Antwerpen and delivered by BASF, K+S Nitrogen also marketed the goods of other European fertilizer producers. K+S Nitrogen was subsequently renamed EuroChem Agro and is based in Mannheim, Germany. EuroChem Antwerpen (BASF fertiliser assets) BASF sold its fertilizers activities in Antwerp, Belgium, to EuroChem on March 31, 2012. Severneft-Urengoy On 19 January 2012 EuroChem acquired Severneft-Urengoy, an oil and gas operator with exploration licenses for gas fields in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District in the North of Russia for US$403 million. The acquisition is part of the company's back integration strategy to meet raw material requirements with its own supply. At full capacity, Severneft-Urengoy could produce enough natural gas to meet close to a quarter of EuroChem's annual requirements. Natural gas is the primary raw material used to produce ammonia, the main building-block for nitrogen-based fertilisers., Karbamid 2 In March 2008 EuroChem purchased a carbamide production unit, Karbamid 2, from Azotara Pancevo for ‚Ç¨32.5 million. The plant was subsequently disassembled and shipped to Russia. The ‚Ç¨32.5 million proceeds from the sale of the fertiliser plant are reported to have gone missing. Azotara-Pancevo's former management is currently under investigation for fraud and mismanagement in relation to the company's privatisation and sale of Karbamid 2 to EuroChem. Charges of organised criminal activity have been lodged against the consortium's management and various allegations of fraud are being investigated. An international arrest warrant has also been issued for the Lithuanian Chief Financial Officer who signed off Karbamid 2's sale. OJSC Sary-Tas In November 2008 EuroChem acquired 56.33% of the Kazakh owned share capital of OJSC Sary-Tas in Zhambyl region (southern Kazakhstan). The phosphorite pellets production plant ceased production in 1993. EuroChem says it is building a new plant on the site investing over US$2.5 billion. Andrey Melnichenko has asked the Kazakh government to provide cheap gas for the project. = Joint ventures = In July 2013, EuroChem announced plans to establish a joint venture with Chinese fertiliser producer Migao in order to increase its presence in Asia. The joint venture was established in November that year and was expected to produce 60,000 tonnes of potassium nitrate and up to 200,000 tonnes of chloride-free complex fertilizers. The 50:50 joint venture also planned to launch new production units in 2014. In October 2019, EuroChem signed a memorandum of intent with Maire Tecnimont for a potential new urea and ammonia production facility in Kingisepp. Maire Tecnimont is undertaking \\"preliminary engineering and site surveying work\\" in order to ascertain the project's viability.  Reorganisation  On 5 December 2012 Prime News reported that EuroChem planned to set up another unit outside of Russia, acting as the guarantor of the company's Eurobonds and which could later operate the company's potash and gas projects. Referred to as \\"Topco\\" (i.e. top holding company) it would own at least 70% of EuroChem's debt and thus become a core unit in the corporate structure of the group. On 3 October 2014, EuroChem Group AG was established, a new holding company for the Group. The new holding company is a wholly owned subsidiary of EuroChem Group SE (Cyprus) and based in Zug, Switzerland. The new EuroChem Group AG Board of Directors was formed in April 2015. HSE Issues =Chemical spillage= In 2010 EuroChem began constructing a bulk port terminal in Tuapse in the south of Russia. The local environmental organisations accused EuroChem of federal law violation since the construction was taking place in a residential zone. In March 2010, there were reports of a spillage of chemicals at EuroChem's Tuapse terminal while EuroChem was testing the loading of chemical fertilizers onto a tanker. The spillage was later blamed by ecologists for the death of four dolphins at Sochi. Local residents reported a substantial deterioration of air quality claiming that this resulted from the emission at the EuroChem terminal. The local resident's concerns soon led to protests in May 2010 of around 3,000 people against EuroChem. EuroChem denied the company bore any responsibility for the alleged deterioration of air quality in the city. In spite of the denials, EuroChem CEO Dmitri Sterzhnev admitted at a press conference following the protests, that during the test drive of the terminal, the company had in fact violated administrative law and had paid a fine as a result. In June 2011 information about the protests reached Medvedev, who was president at the time and he personally ordered to postpone the launch of Eurochem's terminal in Tuapse. A series of lawsuits was brought by environmental organizations as well as by local residents in district and regional courts. Ultimately the Krasnodar regional court, supported by an expert from the regional unit of Rospotrebnadzor, the state environmental watchdog, ruled in August 2011 that the construction was lawful. The construction of the terminal has now been completed and the port is operating. =Baltic Sea= According to preliminary Finnish research there is a phosphorus leak in the Luga River in the volume of 1,000 tonnes annually. It may be from the gypsum waste piles of the EuroChem factory near Kingisepp, although EuroChem has denied this. In April 2012, Russian officials arrested environmental expert Seppo Knuuttila, who had been working on behalf of the Finnish Environment Institute and HELCOM. He was interrogated for a total of fourteen hours by the officials, who demanded to have his computer at customs. Mr. Knuuttila was examining Luga river phosphate content, as agreed. The findings of an investigation by HELCOM, the international ecological association, found Phosphorit in all likelihood responsible for the pollution. Specifically HELCOM accused EuroChem of improperly monitoring phosphorus runoff from its Phosphorit facility, an issue that was also discussed in the Finnish press in January 2012. The Finnish-Russia cooperation on reducing phosphorus in the Baltic Sea is ongoing indicating the ecological problem is still present. The Helsinki-based John Nurminen Foundation, a Finnish foundation specialized in Baltic Sea protection, has been working with EuroChem on the Baltic Sea phosphorus monitoring and reduction program. In June 2012, EuroChem and the John Nurminen Foundation agreed to jointly appoint an independent organization to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of the surface water run-off treatment system which was constructed at the Phosphorit factory in March 2012. The system was constructed to purify phosphorus containing surface water run-off, originating in the area adjacent to the factory. In July 2013, the John Nurminen Foundation and EuroChem jointly appointed Atkins, a design, engineering and project management consultancies, to assess a surface run-off treatment system near the Phosphorit fertilizer facility and to conduct monitoring of the Luga River. Atkins will also monitor phosphorus concentrations in the Luga River upstream and downstream of the factory for one year, and calculate river phosphorus loads to the Baltic Sea. After having become concerned about the condition of the Baltic Sea in 2004, the Board of the John Nurminen Foundation consulted leading experts on the marine environment to find out if the Foundation could play a concrete role in protecting the Baltic Sea. According to the experts, the fastest and most cost-efficient method of improving the condition of the Baltic Sea would be to intervene in the operation of wastewater treatment plants located in its catchment area by intensifying their phosphorus removal. The three largest wastewater treatment plants in St. Petersburg were chosen as the first target. By making their phosphorus removal more effective, the Gulf of Finland's phosphorus load usable for algae can be reduced by almost 27%. According to the Finnish Environment Institute, this is the quickest and most cost-effective way to improve the open sea condition of the Gulf of Finland, when comparing all possible water protection measures in Finland and Russia. The measure will visibly reduce the algae growth in the Gulf of Finland after just a few years, provided that the other surrounding circumstances do not change considerably. =Worker fatalities= In May 2009 a warehouse for mineral fertilizer at the Tuapse Buker Terminal partially collapsed killing two contractors present. An investigation into the accident was launched by regional authorities. =Fires= In July 2012, two fires took place at the EuroChem's Nevinnomysski Azot, which is based in the Stavropol region in South-West Russia and primarily produces nitrogen-based fertilizers. According to Russian media no toxic emissions or injuries emanated from the fires.RIA Novosti, 3 August 2012 Litigation =Shaft sinkers= Following the early termination of a shaft construction contract, in October 2012 EuroChem filed a claim against Shaft Sinkers (Pty) Ltd. (Shaft Sinkers), seeking US$800 million compensation for the direct costs and substantial lost profits arising from the delay in commencing potash production. This was a result of the alleged inability of Shaft Sinkers to fulfill its contractual obligations and complete the construction of the Gremyachinskoe cage shaft, primarily due to problems with the grouting technology. In October 2012 Shaft Sinkers presented an interim claim letter to the Group claiming compensation of US$45 million in costs incurred by them up to and inclusive of 30 September 2012 in connection with the termination of the construction contract. The above disputes are subject to arbitration as specified in the contract. An outstanding advance given to Shaft Sinkers of 495,387 thousand was written off during the nine months ended 30 September 2012. As well, due to the failure of the grouting technology employed in the cage shaft construction, expenses previously capitalised, amounting to 3.116 billion, were written-off during the nine months ended 30 September 2012. EuroChem lodged claims in the Dutch courts accusing International Mineral Resources (IMR), wholly owned by the ENRC trio of Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov, of \\"blatant fraud, exacerbated by bribery\\". EuroChem had previously said it was claiming damages of $800m (¬£500m) from its supplier Shaft Sinkers, which is 48% owned by IMR, following problems with a $2bn Russian potash mining project. In the new case, the fertiliser group alleges that an IMR executive bribed a EuroChem employee with hundreds of thousands of roubles to cover up the alleged ineffectiveness of Shaft Sinkers' work. It also claims IMR facilitated the concealment of a report that questioned whether Shaft Sinkers's sealing technology could be effective on the potash project. EuroChem obtained an interim freezing order covering more than ‚Ç¨886.5m of assets belonging to International Mineral Resources (IMR), a company owned by the founders of ENRC. The order was granted pending a full trial by a Dutch court as part of a civil suit filed by EuroChem. It claims damages of ‚Ç¨660m over fraud allegedly committed by an employee of Shaft Sinkers, the South African mine shaft excavator company in which IMR holds a 48 per cent stake. Shaft Sinkers has dismissed as \\"nonsensical\\" the claim brought by EuroChem, Russia's third- largest fertiliser firm over the flooding of a mineshaft that delayed a $4 billion potash project. The case is ongoing. =Severneft-Urengoy= On 19 January 2012 EuroChem acquired Severneft-Urengoy, an oil and gas operator with exploration licenses for gas fields in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District in the North of Russia for US$403 million. In March 2013 \\"Reverta AS\\" filed a claim against LLC \\"NK Severneft\\" and LLC \\"Severneft-Urengoy\\" contesting the property purchase and sale transactions made between these two entities in 2011, preceding the acquisition of LLC \\"Severneft-Urengoy\\" by the Group. As part of the proceeding, the court had issued a ruling to impose injunctive relief restricting the ability of LLC \\"Severneft-Urengoy\\" to dispose of certain property. The Group contested the restriction and in June 2013 the arbitration court dismissed the injunction. The case had no bearing on the Group's activity. =Monopoly claims= The EuroChem owned Nevinnomysskiy AZOT plant was fined by the Federal Anti-Monopoly Authority in 2007 for exploiting its dominant position as the owner of the electricity network in Nevinnomyssk and depriving other companies of access. = Ukraine anti-dumping duties = In September 2019, the WTO Appellate Body ruled that anti-dumping duties imposed by Ukraine on ammonium nitrate imports from Russia are violating WTO rules, specifically Article 5.8 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement. The court thereby upheld Russia's claim that Kiev should have excluded EuroChem, arguing that its dumping had been minimal. Financing In April 2013 the Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported that EuroChem was looking to take a loan of US$700 million to finance its current development projects. The loan will reportedly be issued by a consortium of Russian and foreign banks. On 27 August 2013 EuroChem announced that it has signed a new debut US$1,300,000,000 unsecured loan facility on a club basis. The proceeds were used to pay down the outstanding amount under EuroChem's 2011 US$1.3 billion pre-export facility. In February 2014 EuroChem reported its net profit fell 62 percent in 2013 to 12.3bn (US$350 million) due to weak prices in the fertiliser markets. =Initial public offering= In March 2013, Andrey Melnichenko revealed that EuroChem is planning an IPO in the next few years. The chairman said the company will launch an IPO after it had completed the development of its potash assets and suggested a date at the beginning of 2016. EuroChem will set the parameters of the offering in 2015 but Melnichenko said that the stake is likely to exceed 20%. Chief financial officer Andrey Ilyin has said EuroChem plans to issue about 25% of its shares in London in 2017 or 2018.

They eventually start worshipping a dead pig's head, calling it Lord of the Flies, which is a translation of the name of Beelzebub, a satanic being. NOSFERATU's \\"Lord of The Flies\\" album was recorded and mixed at House in The Woods Residential Studio, Bletchingley Surrey in July and August 1997. Rat Scabies formerly of The Damned, drummed on the songs \\"Witching Hour\\", \\"Torturous\\" and \\"Ascension\\" and was driven to the recording studio by Segs (The Ruts) due to Rat having severed a tendon in his thumb.

It was released digitally on 1 June 2012 through Syco and RCA Records, and a physical version was issued three days later. The album marks her final record with both record labels, parting between 2012 and the following year. Burke started working on the album in late 2010, and collaborated with Cutfather, Erick Morillo, Autumn Rowe, and Ben Adams, amongst others. Burke had also worked with RedOne, who previously produced a chunk of her debut album Overcome (2009), but none of the recordings were included on this album. Described by Burke as an album full of \\"risks\\", Heartbreak on Hold is a dance record that include elements of house, EDM, Eurodance and R&B.; Despite the record being pre-conceived in 2010, the lyrical content and themes are loosely inspired by her breakup with Jermain Defoe in 2012. Some tracks discuss about being free and having fun after heartbreak, and also encompass themes of love, dancing and female empowerment. The album's title was also inspired by her departure from Defoe. Heartbreak on Hold suffered a long series of delays to its release. It was originally scheduled to premiere in mid-2011, but was scrapped for unknown reasons. Eventually, the label schedule to release in early 2012, but was pulled due to her departure with Syco that following year. RCA decided to re-schedule its release date on 1 June 2012 worldwide, and focus on physical versions in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. Upon its release, Heartbreak on Hold received mixed reviews from music critics. The production and commercial appeal was noted positively by critics, but were ambivalent on its lack of depth, the lyrical content and generic composition. Commercially, Heartbreak on Hold performed moderately in her native country. It opened at number 18 on the UK Albums Chart, under-performing in comparison to her previous record Overcome (2009). Two singles spawned from the album: \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Let It Go\\". The former reached the top three on the UK Singles Chart, achieving a long-run success in that region, whilst the latter track underperformed by reaching the top 40. Background and production On 15 September 2010, Burke confirmed the early stages of her second studio album. She stated that it would be more of a \\"risk\\" from her debut release. Two months later, Burke revealed that she had started working on the album via her official Twitter account. Half of the record had already been complete by December 2010, and planned on working with frequent collaborator RedOne once again to finish the rest of the album. Moreover, she had ambitions to work with American artists and producers Bruno Mars, Ne-Yo and StarGate in hopes of partaking in a duet to the album. In mid-2011, Burke had signed an album deal with RCA Records, and would release the record with Syco. In August 2011, Burke revealed that she was executive producer of the album too, explaining; \\"[...] With the first album [Overcome] when songs were being mixed, Simon [Cowell] was the one who picked the tracklisting. But with this one, I haven't let anything go past these ears. I approve everything.\\" Burke also wrote certain tracks for the record, which was a first for her. Recording for Heartbreak on Hold commenced in late-2010, and confirmed by December that year that half of the record had been complete. She explained the process by saying,\\"We‚Äôre just getting down and dirty with the next album. I‚Äôm going to take a lot more risks and it's going to be insane.\\" Additionally, she revealed that there was a \\"special duet planned\\". The following month, Burke updated that she had worked with an \\"amazing\\" American artist, but refrained from any further information. She elaborated, \\"I went to New York in December and it just happened, it wasn't planned. At 7am I was in the studio and cut a song with an amazing person, a male artist.\\" One of the album's collaborators, American recording artist Autumn Rowe, confirmed her work with Burke. She stated, \\"I've cut the first record on hers that I ever did, which is going to be on her album, but I can't tell you the name ‚Äì we did that whole song in 45 minutes. She walked in, I was like, 'Nice to meet you, I love you, let's go'. 45 minutes later, the record was done. Boom.\\" Additionally, Colombian DJ Erick Morillo was confirmed to be a featuring artist to the record, specifically on the track \\"Elephant\\". She referred to their expected material as \\"colorful\\" and \\"over-the-top\\". Originally, most of the album was to consist of many duets that Burke had wanted to record, but the final track listing ended up being more about Burke's own voice and point of view and \\"the message [she] is trying to get across.\\" Despite ongoing work with Heartbreak on Hold, Burke went on a recording hiatus in order to conduct her All Night Long Tour throughout the United Kingdom between January to August 2011. The tour took over seven months in total, and resumed activities with the album once the tour was complete. Burke anticipated to release material that year, but was postponed because of this. By mid-August 2011, Burke confirmed the completion of the album. Musicality and songs Some of the album's music was compared to the work of American musician Lady Gaga (pictured). Musically, Heartbreak on Hold is a departure from her previous work, and is a dance record that include elements of house, EDM, Eurodance and R&B.; Matt Collar, a writer from AllMusic, immediately noted the difference between Outcome and this record, saying \\"Heartbreak on Hold, finds the singer shifting away from the pop/R&B; of her debut to a more dance- and club-oriented sound.\\" During the early stages of making Heartbreak on Hold, Burke had discussed that she was intending to take risks for the record. In an interview with Digital Spy, she elaborated; \\"In terms of album two, I've gone in a slightly different direction [...] It's not completely different but it's going to be a lot sexier and a lot more fun.\\" In contrast to her debut record Overcome (2009), Burke stated, \\"A second album should not sound like the first one. I want to better myself and that takes hard work and time. My music has always been R&B; and pop, but my voice is soulful. I want every genre of music in a blender: mix it together, the outcome is me.\\" The album open with its title track, a europop number which features rave-inspired synths and heavy-bass lines that lingers throughout a massive portion of the album. \\"Elephant\\", a duet with DJ Erick Morillo, is one of two songs co-written by Burke. Inspired by 1990s music and culture, \\"Elephant\\" is a heavy electro tune that incorporates Autotune and vocoder pyrotechnics through Burke's vocals. \\"Let It Go\\", the album's second single, boasts a 90s-influenced sound that draws in musical elements of house and club music. Lyrically, the track speaks on letting go and having fun; Burke commented, \\"It's simply about letting go of life's stresses. Let it go, have fun, live life and smile and be happy.\\" \\"This Love Will Survive\\" is a love song that follows a similar dance-remedy, but includes orchestral instrumentation and a \\"rousy melody\\" that was compared to the work of British group Coldplay. \\"Fire\\" was described by Burke as a \\"sexy, female empowering\\" number that is sung above a heavy house beat. Both \\"Fire\\" and \\"This Love Will Survive\\" were compared to the works of American artists Lady Gaga and Robin S., and British group Coldplay. \\"Between the Sheets\\" is the album's first midtempo number, and was positively noted for its slower pace whilst still working within the album's primary dance sound. Lyrically, the track talks about sex and its importance in a relationship. \\"Daylight Robbery\\" is the album's seventh track, and was produced by Michael Woods. Lyrically, it talks about a guy that \\"steals your heart and you didn't think it would happen.\\" \\"Tonight\\" is a track originally performed and produced by Russian musician DJ Smash and Fast Foods. Originally titled \\"Wave\\", the composition was given to Burke to record, and was later covered by Romanian singer Inna for her album Party Never Ends (2013). \\"Love You So Much\\" is a song dedicated to her fan base, and is an uptempo dance number that was compared to the work of Australian singer Kylie Minogue. According to Burke, the following track, \\"Oh La La\\", is about \\"Making that guy work for it. If you want me for the night, even for the first kiss, money where you're mouth is.\\" \\"Oh La La\\" samples a portion of its beat from the song \\"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)\\" by Crystal Waters. \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" discusses her lifestyle as a young child, and talks about having fun and learning life lessons from her parents. Musically, it is a club-inspired number with a midtempo beat. The album closes with the piano ballad \\"What Money Can't Buy\\", one of the two songs written by Burke. Release and artwork Heartbreak on Hold and its singles suffered numerous delays, before eventually being released in June 2012. Burke had anticipated to release the record in late 2011, but was pushed back to an unknown date. Media speculated its postponement was made to avoid any clashes with albums from fellow X Factor alumni including Matt Cardle, Cher Lloyd, One Direction and Leona Lewis. In early August 2011, Burke confirmed its first single, \\"Elephant\\", would be released in a few weeks. This was not until Burke confirmed that promotions were delayed by her record label Syco Music, apologizing online for the inconvenience. Burke further relayed that the album was not in any turmoil of being delayed, and said she would speak upon the issue if it did happen. Three months after much speculation, Burke confirmed to Digital Spy that the album would be delayed till 2012 so she could complete the record. Onwards, \\"Elephant\\" was first to commence promotional activities on 26 February 2012, but was pushed back again to 11 March 2012. On 13 April 2012, Burke revealed that the album was titled, Heartbreak on Hold, and would be released on 4 June 2012. On picking the album track, Heartbreak on Hold, as the album title Burke revealed; \\"When I first heard the song [Heartbreak on Hold] it spoke a lot about what I'd been through in the past year-and-a-half in terms of making my album, stuff that went on in my personal life and I'm the kind of girl that has learnt to turn anything negative into a positive.\\" On 2 May 2012, Burke debuted the artwork and tracklisting for the album, followed by a 30-second sample of each song. Critical reception Heartbreak on Hold received mixed reviews from music critics. Certain critics welcomed Burke's transition into dance and house music. AllMusic editor Matt Collar awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, immediately noticing her musical shift from pop and R&B; to a \\"club-oriented sound\\". He compared a few tracks to the work of Burke's mother and former Soul II Soul vocalist Melissa Bell, and also noted American singers Lady Gaga, Robin S., Janet Jackson, and AUstralian singer Kylie Minogue. He highlighted the title track, \\"Love You That Much\\" and \\"Daylight Robbery\\" as the album's key tracks, and also listed them, alongside \\"Elephant\\", as some of her career highlights. Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, commented that \\"The album falls back on the Auto-Tuned pyrotechnics and clinical club-pop that has currently turned the singles chart into a featureless wasteland, Burke follows a well-travelled road, losing her likable personality en route.\\" Simon Gage from Daily Express agreed, writing: \\"It seems to be very little charisma on this new album of driving pop/dance that she insists has an emotional underpinning.\\" Andy Gill from The Independent commented: \\"The songs (only two of which are actually written by her) cover the well-trodden terrain of heartbreak and hope, while the plethora of producers renders the music blandly generic, another round of Guetta-style synth-stomps and incessant keyboard vamps, largely interchangeable with those on Rihanna's and Madonna's last albums.\\" A more mixed review came from The Observers writer Hermione Hoby who criticised the album, writing: \\"Heartbreak On Hold is a strong argument for a moratorium on songs featuring effects-laden instances of the word \\"tonight\\". It seems to feature in almost every track on Alexandra Burke's second album of relentlessly unimaginative house, each excessively Auto-Tuned Euro-club banger indistinguishable from the next.\\" Jenny Mensah from 4Music gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing: \\"Alexandra Burke‚Äôs second album has some catchy tunes, smooth sounds and great production. However, where this album works best is when it blends the right amount of beats, synths and vocal licks. At times the energy does fall in favour of slower songs like Between The Sheets, but it's with these songs you hear the full force of Alexandra's vocals, without any heavy auto-tuning.\\" Though Robert Corspey from Digital Spy praised the album's material for its catchy melodies and production, he stated; \\"The message [on Heartbreak on Hold] is simple: to forget life's troubles and have a good time. Which would be fine, if the charts weren't already clogged up with similar affirmations to the same Euro-pop tune.\\"  Commercial performance  Heartbreak on Hold received a mediocre chart performance in Ireland. It marked her lowest performing album to date, charting at number 27 on 8 June 2012. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 18. In the United Kingdom, the album sold 6,731 copies in its first week. In its third week the album fell to 92 with sales of 1,565 copies, raising its three-week tally to 10,571, just 4.73% of same stage sales of the 223,407 sales for Overcome. Tonight reached the top of the airplay charts in Greece and has remained in the top ten for four months. Tonight has continued success over Europe. Promotion =Singles= Heartbreak on Hold spawned two singles during its promotional activities. The first single was \\"Elephant\\", featuring and produced by Colombian musician Erick Morillo. Despite continuous delays, the song was released on 9 March 2012 on digital formats. \\"Elephant\\" received mixed reviews from music critics, with most critics being ambivalent towards the track's production, composition and use of Autotune and Vocoder effects. Commercially, it debuted and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, with first-week sales of 42,387. It remains Burke's second highest-charting single in the UK, and a return to the top ten after the performance of her single \\"The Silence\\" from Overcome (2009) reached number 16. A music video was released in early April 2012, featuring the singer with backup dancers having fun and performing in an underground facility. \\"Let it Go\\" served as the album's second single on 22 May 2015, and was released in digital formats. Critically, the song attracted mixed reviews from critics. Some praised its composition and catchy melody, whilst some criticized its generic production and lack of personality through its lyrical content. Commercially, \\"Let It Go\\" underperformed by reaching number 33 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her lowest-charting single. Moreover, it debuted at number 33 on the UK Digital Chart with download sales of 11,586. In its second week on the chart, \\"Let It Go\\" fell to number 74, selling 4,461 copies. Initially, Burke spoke with Digital Spy at T4 on the Beach in early July 2012, and confirmed that her record label had scheduled a third single, and would featured a male artist.

It covers his pre-war experience in London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom. Chiang Yee's account was one of the first widely available books written by a Chinese author in English. He was fascinated by such social conventions as afternoon tea and discussing the weather. Comparing London with China Chiang Yee draws parallels and contrasts: :\\"I am bound to look at things from a different angle, but I have never agreed with people who hold that the various nationalities differ greatly from each other. They may be different superficially, but they eat, drink, sleep, dress, and shelter themselves from the wind and rain in the same way.\\" The book is illustrated by the author with colour and monochrome plates in a Chinese style. The book was originally published by Country Life in London. Second and third impressions were published in 1938 and a fourth impression was published in 1940. It was reprinted by Signal Books in 2001 (). This book is part of The Silent Traveller series. In 1940, he moved from London to Oxford due to the loss of his flat during the Blitz in World War II, and subsequently wrote The Silent Traveller in Oxford in 1944.

The village was home to Alexander Graham Bell and was witness to the first flight in the commonwealth with Bell's Silver Dart.  Early settlement  Indian Camp at Baddeck, 1885 The name \\"Baddeck\\" is believed to originate from a Mi'kmaq word. One theory is that it originates from the word \\"Abadek\\" or \\"Abadak\\", which means \\"a portion of food set aside for someone or a sultry place\\" while another theory is that it originates from a word meaning \\"place with an island near\\". Europeans discovered the inland part of Cape Breton Island during the 17th century when Jesuit missionaries from France established a settlement at nearby St. Anns in 1629. British settlement came during the 18th century after the territory was ceded by France; a United Empire Loyalist Cpt. Jonathan Jones (retired British Army) and his family arrived in 1790 and were given a Crown land grant in the Baddeck River valley. They were followed by other Loyalists and immigrants from Scotland. Island settlement  In 1819, Lt. James Duffus (half pay Naval Officer), whose brother-in-law was Sir Samuel Cunard founder of the Cunard Line of steamships, founded his home on what is now known as Kidston Island‚Äîthen known as Mutton Island‚Äîoff the shore of present-day Baddeck. Duffus renamed the island Duke of Kent's Island, in honour of his patron. Duffus operated a mercantile business on the island, serving people from River Baddeck and Grand Narrows; customers were ferried to the island by canoe. In 1820 Duffus was appointed a magistrate and in 1826 he was granted 400 acres on the mainland. Duffus died in 1833, and his former assistants operated the business for a little over two years. In 1836 the executors of his estate in Halifax sent William Kidston to wind up his business. While here he met and ended up marrying Margaret Ann Duffus, widow of James Duffus, in 1836. The Kidston business was moved to the mainland in 1840 and was later taken over by a gentleman from Colchester County named Angus Tupper. Early village history The history of the village proper began in 1839 with the settlement of two families on the mainland. The first was that of Joseph Campbell, a native of Newry, Ireland who built an Inn on a property near Indian Cove. The Inn also contained a tavern and a Post Office, and Mr. Campbell became Baddeck's first Post Master. Mail was brought from Sydney by carriers on foot with the mail bags on their backs. Mr. Campbell later moved to the United States. The second family was that of Hector MacLean of Scotland who built his home on the property adjoining the old Knox Cemetery on the Bay Road. Between these two homesteads there were no other residences but the wigwams of the Indians along the shore of the Lake. In 1841, Mr. Charles James Campbell, who in later years was known far and wide as the Hon. C. J. Campbell, opened a store on the waterfront. He catered to the large Scottish trade in the area and across the lake in Boisdale, Iona, Grand Narrows, and Washabuck. He swept all opposition before him for was he not a Highlander, speaking Gaelic as his mother tongue. The Hon. Mr. Campbell who was largely responsible for the growth of the village. In addition to his mercantile business he undertook shipbuilding and turned out many large ships between 1844 and 1881. He also developed the Kelly's Cove coal deposits and built his home which later became the Hotel Baddeck which eventually burned down. He named it 'Duntulum House', a name now given to one of our streets and where now stands the Alderwood Rest Home. He also donated the land for the new cemetery and was one of the first to be interred there. The settlement of New Campbellton was named in his honor and for many years his face looked out from a plaque above the door of 'Gertrude Hall' which was destroyed by fire in 1939. Growth of the village =Shire town= Up until 1851 Baddeck was known as Little Baddeck and it was part of Cape Breton County. William Kidston advocated the separation of Cape Breton County. In 1851 Kidston's advocacy paid off and Victoria County was split off from Cape Breton county and Baddeck became known by its present name. Kidston also advocated for Baddeck to become the site for the new county's jail and court house, which happened when Baddeck was established as the shire town of the county. When Baddeck became the shire town of the county, it established a municipal council and Murdoch MacAskill became the village custos rotulorum.http://www.victoriacounty.com/history.html The Victoria County Court House was finally constructed in 1889. A view of the village of Baddeck, looking across Baddeck harbour from Lighthouse Point on Kidston Island. =Baddeck, And that Sort of Thing= Baddeck rose to fame in 1874, with the publication of Baddeck, And That Sort of Thing by American writer and associate of Mark Twain, Charles Dudley Warner. Warner had visited Baddeck the previous year with Joseph Twichell and documented the voyage in the book. Warner stayed at the Telegraph House during his visit, a hotel built in 1861 and that still operates today. Warner described Baddeck as a \\"clean- looking village of white wooden houses, of perhaps seven or eight hundred inhabitants\\". Warner attended a church service at the kirk near the water. This church would have been Knox Church, a Presbyterian church built on Bay Road in 1857. He describes the church as being similar in appearance to a New England meeting house, with a pretty wooden spire and a plain, ugly interior. Warner also visited the county jail in Baddeck, which at the time was housing a single prisoner‚Äîa carpenter who was permitted to have a workbench and newspapers. The jail had four rooms on the ground floor and an attic with a \\"sleeping-room\\". The jailer's family was, at the time, staying in one of the empty cells. In addition to the church and jail, Warner describes Baddeck as having \\"very good schools\\" on par with those in Boston. Other travel books followed Warner's publication. In 1885 Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin published The Cruise of the Alice May in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Adjacent Waters which included a description of Baddeck. According to Benjamin, Baddeck at this time consisted of highlanders‚Äîmany of whom spoke only Gaelic.  Alexander Graham Bell era  In 1885, Alexander Graham Bell, his wife Mabel, and their two young daughters, arrived by boat via the St. Peters Canal. They fell in love with Baddeck and built two homes on their estate, which they named \\"Beinn Bhreagh\\" (Gaelic for 'Beautiful Mountain'), as well as another Bell Laboratory, an additional namesake to AT&T;'s Bell Laboratories many years later. Dr. Bell and his family helped the people of the village begin a new era. Alec Bell, who was a Scot and could speak Gaelic, took Baddeck to heart and made their home a gathering place for the village. Alec and his wife Mabel promoted culture, sociability, science and industry among the villagers.Bethune, Jocelyn. Historic Baddeck: Images of our past, Nimbus Publishing, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 2009, , . Women workers building lifeboats at Dr. Alexander Graham Bell's laboratory at Beinn Bhreagh. In his new laboratory on Beinn Bhreagh across the bay from Baddeck, Alec Bell conducted experiments, built mammoth kites, airplanes, hydrofoil boats, and, during World War I, lifeboats for the Royal Canadian Navy. The Bells provided steady employment for many in the village; while Mabel Bell did much to foster home industries, among them the hooking of rugs for which the village of Ch√©ticamp is in the present day famous. =Aviation= Bell undertook experiments with tetrahedral kites at his lab in Baddeck. On 6 December 1907, Thomas Etholen Selfridge piloted Bell's AEA Cygnet as it was towed into the air behind a motorboat, eventually reaching a height of in what was the first recorded heavier-than-air flight in Canada.\\"The ‚ÄúSilver Dart‚Äù Legacy: Alexander Graham Bell‚Äôs Flying Machines of the Future~ A Chronology.\\" Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site of Canada, 2012. Retrieved: 17 May 2012. These experiments latter allowed Baddeck to become the site of the first controlled powered aircraft to fly in Canada and the British Empire. Bell's aircraft, named the Silver Dart, was first flown from the ice of Baddeck Bay on 23 February 1909 by Bell's associate, J.A.D. McCurdy. In the months after the flight of the Silver Dart, Bell's associates Casey Baldwin and McCurdy established the Canadian Aerodrome Company in Baddeck with Bell's financial backing. It was the first commercial aircraft manufacturer in the British Empire and it produced the first Canadian designed and built aircraft in 1909, the Baddeck No. 1, and a copy named the Baddeck No. 2. They also produced the Hubbard Monoplane in 1910, the first Canadian plane built for export. McCurdy and Baldwin also built Bell's experimental Bell Oionus I, though it never took flight. The Canadian Aerodrome Company ceased operations in 1910. =Hydrofoils= Another one of Bell's experimental craft, the hydrofoil HD-4 (once piloted by Mabel Bell) established the world watercraft speed record in 1917 after travelling at across Baddeck Bay (part of Bras d'Or Lake) ‚Äì a speed record that endured for 20 years. In 1968 the Canadian Forces named a new experimental hydrofoil patrol ship in honour of those early experiments. (see Frederick Walker Baldwin) =Death= Alexander Graham Bell spent his last thirty years increasingly at Beinn Bhreagh, sometimes living there year-round in his turreted mansion, and died there in 1922. His wife followed him a few months later and today their remains rest together at the top of their mountain overlooking Bras d'Or Lake under a boulder of granite.  Establishment of the Baddeck Academy  About this time a far-seeing resident named Hezekiah Ingraham took steps to educate his family. He hired a teacher and set aside a room in his home where the children of the neighbourhood were introduced to the three 'R's'. Though himself a Protestant, he made no religious distinction. This is surprising because at that time religious intolerance and bigotry was the rule, but more than a few Catholic children were among those receiving instruction. Soon the small room could no longer contain the numbers and so the first school in Victoria County was built. Among the pioneer families who lived in the area at this time we find such names as Sparling, Leaver, Taylor, Robertson, and others many of which still remain throughout the area.  Places of worship  The first church built in Baddeck was erected on the Bay Road in 1841. It was removed in 1865 and a larger edifice took its place. In 1890 this was abandoned and Greenwood Church was built on its present site. In 1925 when Greenwood joined the union, a new Knox Church, the present structure, was built on Grant Street. A Methodist Church was built but was later demolished because of diminishing membership though the Rectory still stands and is used as a dwelling. In 1880 St. Peter's Church of England and a Congregational Church were built. The latter was later purchased by Mrs. Dr. Bell and renamed 'Gertrude Hall'. For a time it housed the Baddeck Public Library but was destroyed by fire in 1939 when only 1,800 of its 8,000 books were saved. The first Catholic Church was built on the present site in 1858 and was named St. Michael's. It was lost in the big fire of 1926, but a new St. Michael's soon rose from the ashes of the old one.  Lake transport and shipping  A view over the roof tops of the village of Baddeck, looking east out toward the Baddeck Wharf and Kidston Island Lighthouse with Red Head in the distance. Coastal Steamer at the Wharf, 1914 The first freight and passenger ship to come up the Bras d'Or Lake, called the 'Banshee', arrived in 1855. As the years went by, and more and more business opened up, more and larger ships arrived and an extensive export business was carried on with Newfoundland and the French Island of St. Pierre. Chief exports were cattle, sheep, and farm produce. New buildings went up, among them the Telegraph House (still operated by descendants of the first owners, Mr. and Mrs. David Dunlop) in 1860. Prominent among business names of that time were Joseph Hart and Son, MacKay and MacAskill, J.P. MacLeod, D.F. MacRae (White Store), John E. Campbell and others .  Additional information  When Baddeck was an up-and-coming community in its early years, it boasted three newspapers: The Telephone edited by Mr. Charles Pippy; The Island Reporter, by Mr. W.F. McCurdy; and later the Victoria News by Mr. Charles Gilman. It had five doctors, three lawyers, a drug store, two hotels, six stores, a Chinese laundry, two merchant tailors, marble and granite works, a brass band and bandstand, a photographic store, plank sidewalks, and telephone facilities. A court house was built in 1890 and a yacht club in 1902. The Home and School Association had its birth at Baddeck in 1895 and the public library of 8,000 books was housed in Gertrude Hall. The outlying sections at this time were all prosperous farms until the markets for their produce were lost. Today there are ghost farms where once flourished stables full of beautiful horses and cattle. The homes were furnished with hand woven carpets, drapes, linen and bedding, and much of their furniture was made by hand, many of the people being skilled craftsmen. Tragedy struck Baddeck twice during the early 20th century, first in 1908 when an epidemic of cholera broke out, taking the lives of 31 residents. Then on the eve of Labour Day in 1926, a fire broke out in the general store of MacKay and MacAskill on Main Street. Firefighters were hampered by lack of equipment and before dawn the fire had spread and more than 20 buildings were destroyed in the conflagration. During World War II the Royal Canadian Navy named a .

Like many National Guard field artillery battalions, it is the sole battalion in the regiment. The battalion is currently headquartered in Hutchinson, and consists of three firing batteries: Alpha (Dodge City), Bravo (Abilene), Charlie (Newton), and a Headquarters Battery (Hutchinson). The battalion has habitual relationships with the 1161st Forward Support Company (Hutchinson) and Battery E (Target Acquisition) 161st Field Artillery Regiment(Great Bend). History The 1-161 FA has its roots as the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Kansas Volunteer Militia, which was organized from existing units in 1880. The regiment was mustered into federal service in June 1916 for duty guarding the Mexican Border against invasion. The regiment served for 5 months at Eagle Pass, Texas. In August 1917, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was drafted into federal service and in October of that same year, was consolidated with the 1st Infantry Regiment and re-designated the 137th Infantry, Kansas National Guard and assigned to the 35th Division. The regiment saw duty in France and participated in the Meuse- Argonne offensive. They were demobilized in May 1919, after 34 months of active duty service. In November 1921, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was re- designated as the 161st Field Artillery Regiment and assigned to the 35th Division. In December 1940 the regiment was inducted into federal service. In December 1941, the regiment, along with the rest of the 35th Division, was moved to California to defend against possible Japanese invasion. On 3 February 1942, the regiment was divided into the 161st Field Artillery Battalion (the former 1st Battalion), assigned to the 35th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Battalion, 195th Field Artillery Regiment (the former 2nd Battalion), which became a separate unit. The 35th Division began training in April 1943 at Fort Rucker, AL. The division arrived in England in May 1944, and returned to the United States in November 1945. From 1946 to 1998, the 161st's designation was changed nine times from regiment to battalion, with various naming conventions In 2001, the battalion was mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle and provided force protection and gate security at McConnell AFB, Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley. Members of Bravo Battery, which was based out of Pratt, were deployed in 2005 to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. One Soldier lost his life while serving in Iraq. The battery returned in July 2007. That same month, the rest of the battalion was notified that they would be deployed to Iraq. In October of that year Headquarters Battery, Alpha Battery, Charlie Battery and the 1161st FSC began pre-mobilization training and deployed in February 2008. Headquarters Battery was sent to Baghdad, while the remainder of the Battalion, with reinforcements from Battery E 161st Field Artillery, were sent to FOB Grizzly to provide force protection. One soldier, Specialist Ronald Schmidt stationed in FOB Grizzly, lost his life on that deployment as well The battalion was again mobilized in February 2011 for deployment to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti.

Raised in Milwaukee, he moved to Manitowoc after the War in the late 1940s to setup a dental practice. After settling in and starting a family, he embarked on a simultaneous career as an artist. In the following decades he produced a prodigious volume of art. Upon retiring from dentistry in 1987, Rotter moved his artwork from the basement of his office to a large 100-year-old warehouse. As the warehouse filled with art, it was transformed into the self-designated Rudy Rotter Museum of Sculpture. Rotter created over 15,000 pieces of art over 45 years. Early Life of the Artist Rudy Rotter grew up on the south side of Milwaukee in an Eastern European immigrant neighborhood as the youngest of six children. The family arrived at the turn of the last century, moving into a Polish-speaking neighborhood. There they built up seven small businesses before the Crash of 1929. Despite a setback during the Great Depression all the children achieved an education and entered the American mainstream. In high school, Rudy and his brother Peter became all-city football stars; an anomaly and special distinction for Jewish kids of their era. Rotter would later fashion his immigrant family experience into mythic-style tale which he then employed as the core conceptual structure of his art. Prior to artmaking, in the early 1950s Rotter first began exercising his creative impulses as an inventor. His most notable accomplishment was inventing the first sugarless chewing gum. Other small inventions followed, but none became mature enterprises. By 1954 Rotter began to make art, a pursuit that would occupy all of his free time for the remainder of his life. Self-taught Outsider As a self-taught artist Rotter worked outside of the norms and expectations of the traditional art community. Although generally aware of art history, he had no formal art training. Instead he relied upon his inner muse to provide the substance and style of his art. Commercial success was not a driver. Rather he possessed an inner compulsion to create, which he did every day for decades. Rotter's limited early involvement with art included a modeling stint for his sister‚Äôs art classes while an athlete at the University of Wisconsin. In dental school in the early 1940s, he attended human anatomy classes which included dissection. This knowledge was leveraged decades later in his drawings and sculptures. Rotter was the paradox of an educated man who created na√Øve self-taught art. 15,000 Works of Art and the Rudy Rotter Museum of Sculpture Rotter believed that the practice of art required constant and diligent hard work and commitment, and through this effort would come forth meaningful art. His lifetime creation of 15,000 works of art gave him the designation as the most prolific artist in the state of Wisconsin and possibly the nation. His compulsive daily production eventually filled a 21,000 sq. ft. warehouse. This space became the self-designated Rudy Rotter Museum of Sculpture. It was said this densely packed warehouse/museum was an art environment unto itself. Rotter‚Äôs pieces range from large mahogany bas reliefs based on the Old-Testament, to miniature machetes of imagined temples, to seven-foot tall standing wood figures. He also created paintings on found and donated materials, small assemblages, and thousands of drawings with Japanese oil crayon, and later standard magic markers. After Rotter's passing, and due to structural problems with the building, the Museum was disassembled in 2011. The art was moved to another local location. In the process, a small portion of the collection was disseminated to various interested people and institutions in Wisconsin. The remaining art, which covered three floors of the warehouse was returned in 2015, but no longer set out in a curated and ordered state. Variety of Styles ‚Äì Consistency of Theme Rotter began sculpting at the age of 43, making half-size human figures in clay. By the late 1970s he was sculpting teak bas reliefs from hardwood scraps provided by a local yacht builder. At this same time he was making small machetes of imagined grand monuments. His eclectic style was born out of his constant drive to create and experiment. He used found and scavenged materials. These often suggested new forms, formats, and ideas. Unusual materials included his sister's old mink coat, scrap leather, shiny trophy factory discards, wallpaper samples, thrift shop finds, commercial paper scrap, and more. In his last decade he added drawn images on to photographic prints. Rotter employed a variety of styles over time. Although he expressed himself intuitively without preconceived notions of what he would produce, his work had a thematic consistency. Humanism - The Family of Man The basis of Rudy Rotter‚Äôs art is humanism. Rotter consistently invoked the theme of the nuclear family, and more broadly, the family of man. He used simplified images to express his strong feelings of interconnectedness, and the familial love and joy he recalled from his youth. To this well-grounded basic theme, he often added \\"imaginary creatures\\" and other surreal dreamlike expressions. His archetypal figures are generally rendered in side or frontal view, and drawn efficiently with a limited number of lines and strokes. This basic method of depiction allowed for the figures to be both actors expressing the core human condition‚Äîwhile at the same time, and of equal importance, each artwork became a sophisticated abstract composition unto itself. The art both tells a story, and at the same time creates a visceral visual experience for the viewer. By being incessantly creative with the constant re-combination of familiar subjects and new materials, Rotter keeps his humanistic theme fresh and unhackneyed with each iteration of this familial tale. Obsessive Production Rotter had strong views on the process and philosophy of art making. To him the joy was found in the process of creating. The act of making was more important than the finished product. Since the act of making art was paramount, he did not self-critique his completed work. When a piece was finished, it was set aside and the next piece was begun. When asked what was his favorite piece, he'd answer ‚ÄúThe one I‚Äôm working on now.‚ÄùRudy's response to his daughter, Linda (and others), when asked about his favorite piece. This mode of continuous obsessive production is seen among many outsider artists. Over the years none of his art was discarded. When the artwork began to completely fill the warehouse, he self-designated the space as the Rudy Rotter Museum of Sculpture; the scale and content of which fascinated and awed those who visited. From Early to Late Period Rotter's Early Period (1958-1989) sculptures and drawings are most often composed of entwined and physically interrelating figures. The usually unclothed figures are without the standard cultural references to time and place. Thus they become expressions of universal humanity. With advancing age, Rotter‚Äôs strength declined. This change lead to his Late Period (1990 ‚Äì 2001) work when he transitioned from hard, heavy objects to light-weight materials. His supplies included collections of wallpaper samples, shiny metal trophy discards, commercial tile samples, and a variety of other found and thrift store acquired objects. This change of materials and a resulting more flexible manner of art making, lead to his works becoming increasingly abstract and playful. The drawings and multi-material plaques from this Late Period are basic images rendered quickly with efficient line and color. Each work is an interplay of literal subjects, boldly crafted materials, and abstract formats. The artistic merits of each piece are as important as the content. His last decade may have been his most innovative. Exhibition History Beginning in 1958, Rudy began showing in local and state-wide locations, such as libraries, the Wisconsin State Fair, and local colleges.Rudy Rotter: Exhibitions and Collections (a partial listing) 2019 http://rudyrotterart.com/documents/rudyrotterexhibitions.pdf He donated work to public institutions throughout the City of Manitowoc. By 1978 he was in the exhibition entitled \\"Grass Roots Art: Wisconsin\\" at the Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He continued to show infrequently in small venues through the early 1990s. In 1996, the Kohler Foundation acquired 100 pieces of Rotter's art for their permanent collection. In 2003 his work was included in \\"Remembrance and Ritual: Jewish Folk Artists of Our Time\\" at the Andrew Edlin Gallery in New York. Later in 2004, his drawings made with magic markers on photographs and prints were shown in \\"Create and Be Recognized: Photography on the Edge\\" at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, and published in a book of the same name. The Portrait Society Gallery presented Rotter's art in annual shows during his final decade. In 2019, the artist's work was displayed at the Outsider Art Fair in New York, and was featured in an article in the Folk Art Messenger's 2018 Fall/Winter edition. Various institutions have recently added Rotter's artwork to their permanent collections. These include the Kohler Foundation, INTUIT of Chicago, Museum of Wisconsin Art, Haggerty Museum of Art, University of Wisconsin Green Bay, Rahr West Art Museum, and the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. While Rudy Rotter intermittently exhibited in small art shows, he believed his art was ignored at the level of recognition it deserved and was misunderstood by most. The Kohler Foundation acquisition near the end of his life provided the formal validation he long desired. The Magic of Rudy's Art The gallerist Debra Brehmer of the Portrait Society Gallery of Milwaukee, WI, succinctly summed up the experience of entering Rudy‚Äôs warehouse after his passing: > ‚ÄúTo enter the warehouse, even in its present state, is to come in contact > with a relentlessly committed spirit. Rotter believed that there was magic > in the act of making things. To tap into these free forces of boundless > potentiality, a realm without laws or limits, was to share in the fullest > condition of humanity. The act of creating something, whether it was from a > huge panel of mahogany or some cast off metal pieces from the local trophy > factory, provided an avenue of access to a spiritually infused state. This > is what unifies Rotter‚Äôs extraordinarily diverse body of work. > > For Rotter, it was clearly the act of making things that held the power, not > necessarily the final ‚Äúproduct‚Äù itself. Yet each piece acts a little like an > icon or totem as it gently and often humorously emits material evidence of > Rudy‚Äôs belief in creativity, hard-work and human intimacy. ‚ÄòHere,‚Äô Rudy > seems to be saying with each piece, ‚Äòtake this work of art and remember to > value life.‚Äô‚Äù Rudy Rotter continued to create art daily until his passing in 2001 at the age of 88.

The building was designed by architect Edward Austin Kent in 1906. Kent died in 1912 aboard the RMS Titanic and a memorial plaque is located in the church honoring him. The congregation is currently associated with the Unitarian Universalist Association. The church building was originally called the First Unitarian Church of Buffalo when the congregation was Unitarian in theology. In 1953, the congregation joined with the Universalist Church of the Messiah and began worshiping together as the Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo. The two denominations merged nationally in 1961. Church building Unitarian Church of Buffalo The sanctuary and building was completed in 1906 on land donated by John J. Albright, who built the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY completed in 1905. In 1908, Col. Charles Clifton paid the remaining $25,000 of the mortgage on the church building on the condition that the pews would be forever free. The church is designed in a Gothic Revival style with walls and tracery in the arched windows of Indiana limestone, a crenelated turret, and oak doors decorated with wrought-iron fleur-de-lis. The interior of the church is English Country Gothic in style. The sanctuary has seating for 400 and features a great oak hammer beam ceiling soaring from stone corbels about ten feet above the floor.View of the Sanctuary The walls and floor are of the same Indiana limestone as the exterior. Their plainness serves as contrast to the oak and glass decorative elements. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The Art Nouveau stained glass windows were designed by Harry E. Goodhue, of Boston who also designed stained glass windows for Saint Martin's Church, Providence. The pipe organ in the choir loft was built by the Hutchings-Votey Organ Company in 1906. Hutchings-Votey also built the Newberry Memorial Organ in Woolsey Hall at Yale University and the Naval Academy Chapel Organ located in the United States Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis, Maryland. The Delaware Organ Company of Tonawanda, New York rebuilt the organ in 1960. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 2015, as the First Unitarian Church of Buffalo. It is located in the Elmwood Historic District‚ÄìEast. McCann Memorial library The McCann Memorial Library contains approximately 2,700 books covering a wide variety of topics including all aspects of Unitarian Universalism. The adult collection contains books on the various religions of the world, philosophy, spiritual readings, life issues (e.g. death, divorce, discipline, women's role, LGBTQ issues), environmentalism, religious education, inspiring fiction and poetry, among others. The collections for children and youth contain books to help young people deal with various life issues, as well as many traditional books for casual readers. Unitarian Universalist principles There are seven principles which Unitarian Universalist congregations affirm and promote: *The inherent worth and dignity of every person; *Justice, equity and compassion in human relations; *Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations; *A free and responsible search for truth and meaning; *The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large; *The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all; *Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

It is dedicated to the local saint, Saint Senara, and is at least 1400 years old, though it was rebuilt in the 12th century. It is a Grade I listed building. History A church dedicated to Saint Senara has stood on the current site overlooking the sea since at least the 6th century AD, but the current building is partly Norman and partly of the 13th and 15th centuries (the north aisle 15th century). There is a west tower and the octagonal font may be from the 13th century. It was reputedly founded by Saint Senara on her return from Ireland with her son, who was by then a bishop, when they founded the village of Zennor. One of only two remaining bench-ends in the church portrays the Mermaid of Zennor, depicted admiring herself in a mirror. This is on the so- called \\"Mermaid Chair\\" which also has carvings of fish on the seat, and which is believed to be at least 600 years old. The tower contains tombstones, including one with an inscription for a \\"Hen-pecked husband\\" with a beautiful engraving for the \\"four winds which daily toss this bubble\\". On the church's outside wall, next to the west porch, is a memorial to John Davy, 1891, the last person to speak Cornish fluently. The church is surrounded by a small circular graveyard, the boundaries of which have existed since the Bronze Age and in which parishioners have been buried for centuries. Both this church and the church of the nearby village of Morvah lay claim to the local legend of a cow eating the bell-rope, at a time when such items were fashioned from straw.Gibbons, Gavin (1970) Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, A Geographica Guide, The tower contains six bells in the key of G, four of which were cast by Gillett & Johnston in 1926 to accompany the two medieval bells already there. They are currently unringable due to corrosion of the bell-frame. In 2019, a full restoration of the bells was started by John Taylor & Co, which will once again allow them to be used for change-ringing. Today Saint Senara's is the parish church for Zennor, and mainly serves the village of Zennor, more properly called \\"Zennor Churchtown\\", after the church, to distinguish it from Zennor parish. The church is still used for baptisms, weddings and funerals, as well as for regular Sunday services. The current vicar is the Revd. John Holland, of Carbis Bay. References *Mattingly, Joanna.

The company has been embroiled in scandals involving deceptively selling chicken products as \\"free range\\" and the exploitation of migrant workers. Misleading \\"free to roam\\" labelling scandal In September 2011 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commenced federal court action against Baiada Poultry, Bartter Enterprises, and the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, alleging that they engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct and made misleading representations that meat chickens were \\"free to roam around in large barns\\". The ACCC argued the chickens were reared indoors with high- density stocking (20 chickens per square metre) that significantly restricted their ability to roam. Such a definition of free to roam would leave room for 2.2 chickens on an A3 size page. On 30 October 2013 the Federal Court of Australia ordered Baiada Poultry and Bartter Enterprises, the processors and suppliers of Steggles branded chicken products to pay a total of $400,000 in civil pecuniary penalties, declaring that the companies contravened the Trade Practices Act and the Australian Consumer Law by engaging in \\"false, misleading and deceptive conduct (or conduct liable to mislead and deceive)\\" when it described on product packaging and in advertising that its meat chickens were \\"free to roam in large barns\\". The Australian Chicken Meat Federation, the peak industry lobby group for the Australian chicken meat industry, was also ordered to pay $20,000 in penalties by asserting in publications on its website that chickens in Australia were \\"free to roam\\" or able to \\"roam freely\\" in large barns. Foreign workers exploitation scandals In September 2010, the Australian Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman commenced an investigation into allegations that Adelaide Poultry ‚Äî part of the Baiada Group of Companies, had contravened Commonwealth workplace laws after public comments were made alleging underpayment of its workers. It determined that the company had contravened workplace laws and an agreement to resolve the contravention without the need to resort to civil penalty litigation was made by way of an \\"Enforceable Undertaking\\" made under the Commonwealth Fair Work Act 2009. On 4 May 2015, the Australian Four Corners television program reported on the exploitation of migrant workers within the Baiada factories.Four Corners Investigation. Retrieved 17 May 2015. In response to the allegations, Baiada issued a formal response, stating that \\"there [was] no substantial compliance failures\\" and \\"there [was] no exploitation of migrant workers\\".Baiada's response to the investigation Archived copy Baiada. Retrieved 17 May 2015. However, in his investigation into the matter, the Australian Fair Work Ombudsman confirmed the allegations and found that the company paid foreign workers on holiday \\"417 class\\" working visas about half the lawful minimum hourly wage and that they worked up to 18 hours a day without paid overtime. They foreign workers were forced to live in slum houses with 20 others and to sometimes share mattresses. The Ombudsman found that much of the work was \\"off the books\\" with the foreign workers paid in cash and that the labour hire companies that Baiada engaged provided inadequate, missing or fabricated records. During the course of the investigation, 23 of 39 contractors complained of financial instability and four of six principal contractors ceased trading. Baiada refused to let Fair Work inspectors into their three NSW processing plants ‚Äî at Beresfield, Hanwood and Tamworth during the investigation. Despite promising to improve workplace practices, Baiada continued to attract criticism, including from the Uniting Church. Signed witnesses statements from Baiada chicken plant workers suggested that questionable work practices were continuing at some plants and that the company was still dealing with disreputable labour hire companies. Some of these companies had bogus business addresses. On 26 October 2015 the Fair Work Ombudsman released a statement saying Baiada has agreed to a compliance partnership to \\"make good\\" past underpayments by contractors and to ensure compliance with workplace laws in the future. The company agreed to take responsibility for paying up to $500,000 in wages that its contractors failed to pay workers, even though it did not directly employ them.

The Fabric Connect technology was originally developed by the Enterprise Solutions R&D; department within Nortel Networks. In 2009, Avaya, Inc acquired Nortel Networks Enterprise Business Solutions; this transaction included the Fabric Connect intellectual property together with all of the Ethernet Switching platforms that supported it. Subsequently, the Fabric Connect technology became part of the Extreme Networks portfolio by virtue of their 2017 purchase of the Avaya Networking business and assets. It was during the Avaya era that this technology was promoted as the lead element of the Virtual Enterprise Network Architecture (VENA). For their part, Extreme Networks have stated that the acquisition of the Avaya Networking assets and more specifically the \\"award-winning Fabric technology...strengthens Extreme's position as a leader across the education, healthcare and government markets\\".  Components of Fabric Connect  = Technologies =  Fabric Connect  A network virtualization capability, based on an enhanced implementation of the IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) standard, Fabric Connect offers the ability to create a simplified network that can dynamically virtualize elements to efficiently provision and utilize resources, thus reducing the strain on the network and personnel. Extreme Networks base the Fabric Connect technology on the SPB standard, including support for RFC 6329, and have integrated IP Routing and IP Multicast support; this unified technology allows for the replacement of multiple conventional protocols such as Spanning Tree, RIP and/or OSPF, ECMP, and PIM. Simply put, Fabric Connect's aim is to provide network-wide, end-to- end, multi-layer virtualization.  Fabric Attach  An adjunct to the Fabric Connect technology, Fabric Attach, allows network operators to extend network virtualization directly into the conventional wiring closet (on existing non-Fabric Ethernet Switches) and automate the provisioning of devices to their appropriate virtual network. This is particularly relevant for the mass of unattended network end-point that are now appearing, such as IP Phones, Wireless Access Points, and IP Cameras. Fabric Attach standardized protocols such as 802.1AB LLDP to exchange credentails and obtain provisioning information that allows \\"Client\\" Switches to be automatically re-configured on the fly with parameters that let traffic flows map through to Fabric Connect Edge Switches (aka \\"Backbone Edge Bridge\\" in SPB definition) functioning as a Fabric Attach \\"Server\\" Switch. This method is described by an IETF \\"Internet Draft\\", pending further standardization activity. Fabric Attach is typically used to automate Wiring Closet connectivity, but has the potential to be extensible for use in the Data Center, with Virtual Machines being able to dynamically request VLAN/VSN (Virtual Service Network) assignment based upon application requirements. = Hardware Products =  Virtual Services Platform 9000 Series  A range of modular chassis-based products, featuring a carrier-grade Linux operation system, and designed for high-performance deployment scenarios that need to scale to multiple terabit of switching capacity and support 10 and 40 gigabit Ethernet connections, and is designed to eventually support 100 Gigabit Ethernet.

The girls' school and the campus is named in honour of Sir Michael Macpherson Robertson after MacRobertson donated ¬£100,000 to the State of Victoria, ¬£40,000 of which was spent to construct the school. Norman Seabrook of Seabrook and Fildes architecture practice, designed the building after winning the state-wide design competition with his functional and modern design entry in the Inter-war Functionalist & Moderne style. Constructed in 1934 during centenary celebrations of Victoria, MacRobertson was vital to the progress of modernist architecture in Australia and essential in the strong re-emergence of the state after the economic downturn of the depression. The building was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 23 May 1998 due to the buildings' architectural, historic and social significance to the State of Victoria.  Description  The school was zoned in a functional manner with four wings for different disciplines including classrooms, science rooms, art rooms, and cookery rooms. This allowed for smooth movement between disciplines and also created distinct external courtyard areas around the building. The facade of the building comprises \\"interlocking cubic forms of differing heights\\" which is offset by the vertical clock tower with white rendered vertical strips. The material Seabrook used were functional while at the same time embracing the typical palette of De Stijl movement by using striking colours of cream brick, red steel framed hopper windows and dark blue glazed brick piers between windows. Internally softer shades of red, blue, yellow, green and black were used. With the use of practical floor finish material such as linoleum for classrooms, terracotta tiles for corridors and granolithic materials for the stairs and services rooms. = Key influences = It is believed that the main influence of Seabrook's design for MacRobertson Girls‚Äô High School was William Dudok Hilversum‚Äôs town hall (1923‚Äì31).< Both these buildings have similar brickwork, rectilinear interlocking facades, functional planning, open air classrooms, flat roof, industrial aesthetic and a modern interior fitout. The brickwork used in both consists of two stretchers followed by a header in a Flemish bond with an extra wide and deeply raked horizontal joint which emphasises horizontality, while the cream brickwork emphasised shadows. Seabrook selected local Glen Iris Cream bricks at a time when they were only being used sparingly in buildings such as in polychromatic brickwork. Using the cream brick for the entirety of the building was seen as a modernist approach and set a trend for many future buildings in Victoria. = Design approach = Seabrook had a strong functional design approach to the design of MacRobertson Girls‚Äô High School. He believed that a \\"building must look like what it is, be it a town hall or a destructor plan‚Ä¶\\" . This frame of mind helped in creating the unique and functional design of the building which has had a great impact on Australian architecture. It was the first modernist school constructed in Victoria, at a time when other contemporary schools tended to adopt a variety of Gothic collegiate to Georgian revival style in the design. Robin Boyd described the building as an \\"evolution of modern architecture\\" in Australia. The differing masses of MacRobertson impart proportion and scale to the building, while the De Stijl colour of the articulated red steel hopper windows contrast to the blue glazed brick piers and cream brickwork, helping to break up the facade. Steel windows were not common in schools at this time and are seen as a modernist and functional approach. Seabrook also considered the site in his design, using native plants to embrace the dry, flat scrubland of South Melbourne. The flagpole and clock tower are also significant in his design and can be seen in many of Seabrook's later work.

Coins 'N Things was started in 1973 by Louis Oliari, an engineer and coin collector. His teenaged son Mark had also become deeply engaged in coin collecting, and the father thought that if he indulged his son's hobby interest by operating a small storefront coin trading shop, Mark would eventually \\"get bored\\" with the hobby and \\"get [it] out of [his] system.‚Äù However, after high school, Mark Oliari went to work in the business full-time and later his father left his corporate job to join him. Some time after both Oliaris had started working in the business full-time, Coins ‚ÄôN Things entered the wholesale metals market. While Louis Oliari preferred the retail coin business, Mark Oliari enjoyed trading gold with investors, jewelers, and businesses that needed gold as a raw material. As the wholesale business grew, it began to attain the reputation and financial stature needed to be a leader in that industry. In 2002, the United States Mint approved Coins 'N Things to become one of 11 businesses worldwide authorized to buy American Eagle silver bullion coins for distribution; at that time, qualifications for that authorization included a substantial retail customer base and net worth of at least $5 million. After his father's death in 2008, Mark Oliari closed the retail shop to focus exclusively on metals trading. A line of credit from Wells Fargo provided the financial resources needed to pursue U.S. government business on a large scale. In 2010 the business obtained approval to sell gold to the U.S. federal government. In fiscal year 2011, the company became the U.S. federal government's largest supplier of precious metals, with government gold sales that accounted for about half of the $3.8 billion in contracts to supply silver and gold to the United States Mint during the year. Coins 'N Things ranked number 39 on the list of the top 100 contractors of the U.S. federal government for that same fiscal year, with $1.89 billion in obligations from the government, all from the Treasury Department. It was the single largest contractor to the Treasury DepartmentTop 100 Contractors Report for Fiscal Year 2011, retrieved April 13, 2012 from Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation (U.S. General Services Administration) and the largest gold vendor in the U.S. The business has about 50 employees, including Mark Oliari, his wife Patty, and three children. There are no outside investors. As of 2011, estimated annual revenue was $6.5 billion. The company does not report its net revenues or profits, but Mark Oliari told news media that it retains about 0.25% of the value of transactions involving private customers and a bit less from sales to the government. Gold is obtained from producers in the United States and Canada, with about 40% coming from a refinery owned by the Canadian government.

Definition A health blog can cover diverse health related concerns such as nutrition and diet, fitness, weight control, diseases, disease management, societal trends affecting health, analysis about health, business of health and health research. It acts as a health education platform, where diverse users collaborate to seek and/or contribute health content within the standard guidelines. Although it is not a requirement, a health blog can be interactive, engaging and collaborative with its users in the creation of content. A health blog can grow in user size and operate as an online community. Types Health blogs can be broadly categorized as either a personal journal type or an information site type of blog. There are a wide range of health blog sub-niches that include both journalistic and informative styles. The most common sub-niches include: :* Weight loss/diet blogs offer dieting information or a personal journal of weight loss. :* Nutrition and food blogs are more focused on nutritional balance, supplements and related concerns such as healthy eating. :* Running blogs are often authored by runners who publish their running experiences, training and related concerns. :*Training and exercise blogs publish content about physical exercise and physical training to teach and provide guidance on exercising. :* Disease and disorder blogs are mainly informational authored by doctors and such professionals. This type of blog often includes further sub-niches dedicated to individual diseases and health conditions. :* Healthy living blogs contain information concerned with aspects of a healthy life such as wellness. :* self help blogs that focus on emotional well-being. All these categories can have sub-categories dedicated to specific concerns within their niche. Some health blogs do not fall under any of these categories; others could be classified under more than one. Blogs that only occasionally mention health are not categorised as health blogs, although they may be labeled by the author(s)/owner(s) as such. Users Health blog users can be broadly categorized into authors and readers. Started for different reasons, health blogs characterise owners' interest and objectives. Usually, the owner is the author who updates its content. The author determines the tone, language, frequency of posting, style of writing and other factors that determine the overall feel and look of the blog.McKenzie HM. Why Bother Blogging? Motivations for Adults in the United States to Maintain a Personal Journal Blog [master's thesis]. Raleigh, NC: North Carolina State University; 2008 65pp. More common authors of health blogs include medical professionals, patients and health enthusiasts.Herring, S. C., Scheidt, L. A., Bonus, S., & Wright, E. (2004). Bridging the Gap: A Genre Analysis of Weblogs. In Proceedings of the Thirty-seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-37) (Ed.), Los Alamitos: IEEE Press. Readers broadly include all those who take time to read content posted on blogs, whether as a member or by chance. They include other professionals, patients and interested individuals. Readers make the audience of the blog and its authors. They directly or indirectly contribute to the health blog through commenting, emailing and such feedback techniques. Readers have been responsible of further disseminating health information by sharing it with their social circles. Impact on the health industry The health care industry consists of health providers in diverse fields that include medicine, dentistry, nursing, allied health, assistive personnel and varied health practitioners. There is probably a health blog accounting information on each of these fields. Health blogs have offered a platform to stakeholders to channel developments, research and/or opinion.Blood, R. (2002). Weblogs: A history and perspective. In J. Rodzvilla (Ed.), We've Got Blog: How Weblogs are Changing Our Culture (pp. 7-16). Cambridge MA: Perseus Publishing. With each individual in these groups differently receiving, analysing and disseminating information, health promotion has been diversified and enhanced through personal blogs and websites. Health blogs have transformed how health information is provided, analysed, presented and used. Blogging has improved the communication process, how the general public receives understands and reacts to health information. Blogs offer targeted users the possibility of easily accessing information real-time and capturing readers reactions through comments, emails and such. They influence, criticise, advice, sell and promote health literacy and related health concerns. It is likely that health blogs will have a considerable long-term influence on the industry as the number of health blogs continue to increase. =From the reader's standpoint= Health blogs offer readers a platform to source answers, knowledge, opinion, support and/or guidance while managing their experience. They have brought together users of similar interest closer to finding whatever health information they seek. With a health blog being objective, specialising on a category of interest such as nutrition or weight control, it attracts readers of similar concerns, such as those who seek guidance, answers and such, to participate in the fulfilling their individual objectives and those of the blog. Unlike health-focused magazines and television shows, health blogs are able to be updated more frequently, keeping up to date with the new and up-and-coming health related concerns. The content they publish is also far more personable and easier to access. Health blogs provide first hand information, as well as information based on real-life occurrences such as cancer or weight loss management, contributed by other users who have faced such predicaments. When this content is deemed trustworthy, it attracts and engages more readers in health matters. Depending on which niche a health blog specializes in, it serves as a health education platform, promoting health literacy to its users. Readers gain knowledge, insight, guidance and recommendations from health blogs. As people can share content with other members of community, health blogs promote community health. People refer others to blogs they deem helpful in accord to the going concern. They are allowing ordinary people to partake in the larger health industry. Readers share their perspective, their experiences or just their passive thoughts on what the blog publishes. Usually blogs are created by individuals voicing their experiences, opinion and/or other personal interests. Readers offer their reaction to information posted on health blogs, directly or indirectly influencing the future of the health industry. =From the author's standpoint= Blogs are created for several objectives, often stipulated by its authors who usually double-up as its owners. An author could be an individual or an organisation and is expected to regularly update the blog. Content published on the blog can be to influence, criticise, inform, persuade or any other intent of communication. Unlike mainstream magazines and newspapers, which are constricted to what they write, blogs easily facilitate writing about anything that interests their authors, allowing for a more broad spectrum of focused health concerns. Health blogs allow authors to publish content that is of general information contribution. Authors add their research, opinion and such to the larger wealth of health information. It could be based on real-life experiences, where the author wants a platform to communicate with others of similar concerns. They give authors, especially of personal health blogs, a platform to voice personal experiences, share and help others with a chronology of health experiences. Other health blogs such as those associated with organisations or governments, pass information to the world about products and services, policies, discoveries and such. The blog acts as a contact point with the general public, communicating the intentions, such as marketing drugs, and/or opinion of the author. Authors have benefited from the viral spreading of content published within their target users. Health blogs have made it easier for contributory stakeholders to expend intent and/or necessary information to their target audience. Health blogs have enabled health care stakeholders to create wealth.Scott, David M. (2010), The New Rules of Marketing and PR: How to Use Social Media, Blogs, News Releases, Online Video, and Viral Marketing to Reach Buyers Directly. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. An author, individual or under organisation, can operate a health blog as an online business.Eisingerich, Andreas B.; Kretschmer, Tobias (2008). \\"In E-Commerce, More is More\\". Harvard Business Review 86 (March): 20‚Äì21. An author, depending on granted administrative roles, can advertise and/or promote products and services for financial gains. Adverts, whether related to content published or not, can be a source of income for the author/administrator. Where the health blog is owned or operated by a business organisation, it acts as the front-end user interface directing users to main or back-end sales pages. Health businesses have been known to start blogs to enhance their product and/or service promotion. An individual author can also do so, promoting self-created products and services or those of affiliates. Some health blogs can be classified as shopping blogs since they directly sell health content, products and services.

Mol Cancer Ther 10:1311-6, 2011 The name mouse avatar or avatar mice was originally coined by the Spanish National Cancer Research Center http://www.cnio.es/es/news/docs/manuel-hidalgo-journal-clinical- oncology-10ene12-en.pdf and was subsequently popularized by the journals Naturehttp://www.nature.com/news/mouse-avatars-could-aid-pancreatic-cancer- therapy-1.10259 and Science,http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2013_03_29/caredit.a1300050 the Mayo Clinic http://newsblog.mayoclinic.org/2012/04/05/mayo-clinic- launches-whole-genome-breast-cancer-study/ and The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/business/mice-as-stand-ins-in-the-fight- against-disease.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0 among others.http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/348768/description/Of_Mice_and_Man Method Generally, Mouse avatars involve three steps, as follows:Rubio- Viqueira B, Hidalgo M: Direct in vivo xenograft tumor model for predicting chemotherapeutic drug response in cancer patients. Clin Pharmacol Ther 85:217-21, 2009 =Step one= The tumor is obtained by surgical resection. This may cure the patient. The tumor however may regrow, at the same or at a distant location (metastasis), a process that usually entails several months. If this happens, the avatar mice may guide the oncologist to choose the most efficient chemotherapeutic treatment. =Step two= Fresh pieces of the tumor are implanted into mice (these are the so-called ‚Äúfirst-generation‚Äù avatar mice). The implants can be at the same location where the tumor was formed in the patient, in which case are known as orthotopic xenografts or, most commonly, at a different location, generally subcutaneous, in which case are called heterotopic xenografts.Garrido-Laguna I, Uson M, Rajeshkumar NV, et al: Tumor engraftment in nude mice and enrichment in stroma-related gene pathways predicts poor survival and resistance to gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer. Clin Cancer Res, 2011 If necessary, the tumors from the first-generation avatar mice can be extracted, divided into pieces, and implanted again in multiple avatar mice (‚Äúsecond generation‚Äù). This process can be repeated several times to obtain a large number of avatar mice from a single patient. In general, 3-4 generations are needed to obtain enough avatar mice from a single patient. =Step three= Once the desired number of avatar mice has been achieved, the mice are treated with the several available options of chemotherapy (single agents or combined agents). The response of the tumors in the avatar mice to the various chemotherapeutic regimens is examined and the most efficient one is chosen. The whole process usually takes several months. If the tumor of the patient recurs, then the oncologist can decide which chemotherapeutic treatment to apply based on the response of the Morelli MP, Calvo E, Ordonez E, et al: Prioritizing Phase I Treatment Options Through Preclinical Testing on Personalized Tumorgraft.

He has served in advisory roles for a range of local, state and national political figures including United States Vice-President Al Gore, Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York State and California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. From January 2013 to March 2014, Ragone served as Senior Adviser for Strategic Planning for New York Mayor de Blasio. Ragone had a long career in American politics. He was press secretary to then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. Ragone played a crucial role in crafting Newsom‚Äôs major policy issues on topics such as same-sex marriage, universal healthcare and homelessness. Prior to working with Newsom, Ragone served as communications director for Gray Davis and worked in the governor's anti-recall campaign. Ragone was also Al Gore's New York and California presidential campaign communications director. Ragone also served as chief spokesman for Andrew Cuomo in his 2002 run for New York governor. Cuomo chose Ragone for this role after he worked as Cuomo‚Äôs national press office director during his tenure as Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary under the Clinton administration. Ragone also served on former Governor Mario Cuomo‚Äôs campaign for reelection in 1994. Ragone also briefly served on Hillary Rodham Clinton‚Äôs first campaign for Senate and got his start in national politics during the Clinton-Gore coordinated presidential campaign in 1996. Since 2007 (with a break during his tenure as Senior Advisor to the Mayor of New York City), he has served as principal of PWR, LLC, a public affairs consultancy that provides private sector communications advice. In 2011, Ragone founded Exiles, Inc., a company devoted to organizing online clubs for sports fans that live outside the home market of their favorite teams.https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/07/exiles/ Ragone serves on boards including the America‚Äôs Cup Organizing Committee, Tahoe Winter Olympic Games Committee, and ChinaSF. He is often quoted in the media for his opinion on international and domestic public relations issues. He‚Äôs appeared in the New York Times, New York Post, CNN, BBC, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times among other publications. Early life and career Originally from Merrick, New York, Ragone had an early passion for politics. In high school, he subscribed to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and started the Political Awareness Club. Ragone attended State University of New York at Albany where he studied political science, history and Italian. Just after college, Ragone served as president of the New York State Young Democrats. He got his start in Democratic politics by recruiting young voters on behalf of Jerry Jennings, alderman who was running for Mayor of Albany. Jennings continues to serve as Mayor. When Ragone graduated in 1993, Jennings offered to put him on his campaign payroll, but Ragone resisted. In a 2000 interview with The New York Observer, Ragone said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think that I should take money to do something that I believed in.‚Äù Later Ragone went to work for the New York State Democratic Party early in the tenure of state chairwoman Judith Hope. National and state politics Though Ragone was unqualified, by his own account, to serve as a national campaign‚Äôs press officer, the Clinton-Gore coordinated campaign in 1996 selected him for the job. It was during the re- election campaign that Ragone met now New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio who called Ragone \\"energetic, idealistic, willing to do anything...He was extremely persistent.\\" According to a profile in the San Francisco Chronicle, Ragone considers de Blasio one of his mentors. The New York Observer wrote Ragone secured the position due to his ‚Äúwork-for-nothing gene.‚Äù Because the New York primary was uncontested, the campaign didn‚Äôt want to spend significant money in the state. Thus the young Ragone was as a perfect fit for the role. After the campaign, Ragone briefly worked for public relations executive Ken Sunshine before signing on for the gubernatorial campaign of City Council Speaker Peter Vallone. Within days of Vallone‚Äôs loss, Ragone was hired to work for HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who described Ragone as \\"deeply committed to social justice.\\" Cuomo also remarked, ‚Äúsometimes pros in politics become part of a business and lose the advocation\\" and that \\"Peter is principle first.‚Äù In total, Ragone worked at HUD for nine months, before leaving to join Hillary Rodham Clinton‚Äôs campaign for New York Senate. After his brief stint with the Clinton Senate campaign, Ragone began work with Al Gore‚Äôs campaign for President. In his role as press secretary, Ragone directed press strategy in New York and California. Whenever the Vice President visited New York during this primary against Bill Bradley, Ragone was one of the handful of people who briefed Gore daily. In 2002, Ragone returned to Cuomo‚Äôs side for his unsuccessful attempt at the New York State governorship. In 2003, Ragone served as Communications Director for the Governor of California before assuming the role of spokesman for California‚Äôs Against Costly Recall, Governor Gray Davis‚Äô campaign attempt to defeat the recall election. In 2008, Ragone served in a volunteer communications role with Senator Hillary Clinton's campaign for President - working in California, Texas and North Carolina. In 2014, Ragone was named Senior Adviser for Strategic Planning for New York Mayor de Blasio. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom In Gavin Newsom's campaign for mayor in 2003, Ragone‚Äîwho lives in San Francisco and had met Newsom before‚Äîbegan to volunteer on the campaign. This led to his job in the new mayor's administration. Starting in January 2004, Ragone served as Newsom's press secretary and his most influential aide and friend. Sam Singer, a public relations consultant, said of Ragone: \\"He was able to take a newly elected mayor and help position the mayor's administration in a Kennedy-like manner that created an image of a new Camelot. It's very hard to find a communications director of Ragone's ability who can create large-scale imagery.\\" Ragone played a major role in Newsom‚Äôs decision to marry same sex couples in City Hall. According to sources quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle, Ragone was one of a small group of government advisors that supported Newsom‚Äôs marriage decision. After Newsom announced his plans to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, hundreds flooded City Hall with requests to marry, earning the young mayor and his staff national media attention. In 2007, Ragone sparked controversy after admitting he posted, under a pseudonym, positive messages online about Newsom while belittling the mayor's detractors. In 2008, Ragone assisted Newsom in his campaign for Lieutenant Governor of California. He currently serves as a senior advisor to Newsom. Committee & board memberships Ragone is a member of the California Democratic Party‚Äôs finance committee and served on the party Executive Committee. In 2010, Ragone was named Vice Chair of the Board of the San Francisco America‚Äôs Cup Organizing Committee, an organization focused on the 2013 America‚Äôs Cup sailing races being held on the San Francisco Bay. He serves along with Hollywood mogul Steve Bing, Tom Perkins, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, and George Shultz. Ragone was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Tahoe Winter Olympic Games Committee, an organization devoted to bringing the Winter Olympics to the Greater Tahoe area in 2022. Ragone was also a member of the board of directors of ChinaSF, a business organization committed to the development of ties between private companies in San Francisco and China. In 2010, Ragone served on the steering committee for the effort that created the San Francisco Bay Citizen, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to quality journalism in the Bay Area. Personal Ragone lives in San Francisco with his two children. He currently runs PWR LLC, a private sector public affairs consultancy and Exiles Inc, a tech start up that organizes online sports fan clubs dedicated to the out of market fan experience. He enjoys surfing in Pacifica and Santa Cruz and snowboarding at Lake Tahoe on the weekends. Exiles Inc. Exiles Inc. is a company that creates social networking communities for out-of-market sports fans. Ragone currently serves as the co-founder and president of the company. The community has been categorized as a global diaspora social network as it allows expatriated individuals to connect with their homeland sports team.

After winning the by elections held on July 10, 2017 in GBLA-4, Nagar, the PPP has now two seats. GBLA-4 was won by Javaid Hussain of PPP. According to National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and the Election Commission of Pakistan, there are 618,364 registered voters in the region with 329,475 men and 288,889 women. An estimated 600,000 people exercised their right to vote at the polling stations to elect 24 legislators. Three members of the legislative assembly will be elected from District Gilgit, three from District Hunza Nagar, six from Skardu, two from Astor, four from Diamer, three from Ghizer and three from Ganche. The PML-N and the PTI had given party tickets to candidates in all constituencies, while candidates from the PPP were contesting on 22 seats. The MWM had 15 contesting candidates, All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) 13, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) 10, Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) seven, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) six, and Tehreek-e-Islami 12 candidates. The Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly was created through a presidential order in 2009 and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won the subsequent elections, completing a five-year term in office. On December 13, 2014, an interim government was set up with a 12-member caretaker cabinet to conduct free and fair elections. Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) GB Justice (R) Syed Tahir Ali Shah thanked all the political parties for their cooperation in conducting peaceful, smooth and transparent elections. In an interview to a news channel, he said no rigging was reported in any constituency of the region which was a big achievement. He said he was satisfied with the law and order situation in the region throughout the day as no unpleasant incident was reported adding holding transparent elections was his responsibility. Composition As per the results of the 2009 elections, the assembly is split between members of the left leaning and secular Pakistan Peoples Party, the centre-right Pakistan Muslim League, the secular and liberal Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and the Islamist Jamiat Ulema e Islam. In a special by-election in 2011, a candidate from the Balawaristan National Front won a seat from Ghizer with slightly less than 50% of votes cast in his favor. In Sept 2013, FM Nashad from SKD 3 LA 8 won the elections with the majority after Wazir Shakeel resigned from the membership. FM Nashad earlier served as Deputy chief executive for 5 years.

A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors.Dale, H.H. Adventures in Physiology, with Excursions into Autopharmacology: a Selection from the Scientific Publications of Sir Henry Hallett Dale. London: Pergamon press, 1953. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it,Pert, Candace: Molecules Of Emotion: The Science Between Mind-Body Medicine Scribner (1999), by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine. Historically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission,Tansey, T: Sir Henry Dale and autopharmacology: the role of acetylcholine in neurotransmission. Clio Med. 1995;33:179-93. and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions. A research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation,Leme, J.G. Regulatory mechanisms in inflammation: new aspects of autopharmacology. General Pharmacology 02/1981; 12(1):15-24. due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock.Hawgood B.J. Mauricio Rocha e Silva MD : Snake venom, bradykinin and the rise of autopharmacology. Toxicon 1997, vol. 35, no11, pp. 1569-1580 (1 p.1/2) Abstract Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs. Endogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are: * Endorphins * Dynorphin * Bradykinin * Prostaglandins * Angiotensin * Secretin * Gastrin * Cholecystokinin * Histamine * Cannabinoids * Substance P The main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms. The term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced.

He studied at Stuttgart and Paris, and settled in the United States in 1838, his studio being for several years in Philadelphia. He spent the years 1841 to 1845 in Italy, and moved to New York City in 1845, where he resided, with frequent visits to Europe.

He is best known for his discovery of mechanisms by which nucleic acids trigger innate and autoimmune responses from the interior of a cell, work for which he received the 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.  Early life and education  Chen was born in Nandou Village () in Anxi County, Fujian, China. When he was young, his father was sent to Nanping for work, leaving his mother to raise him and his two brothers alone while she also worked as a primary school teacher. He graduated from Anxi No. 1 High School in 1981. He attended Fujian Normal University and received an undergraduate degree in biology in 1985, before he won an overseas scholarship by getting first place in a biochemistry exam. Chen used the scholarship to attend the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he got his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1991. During his graduate education, Chen became interested in the biochemical pathway of the protein ubiquitin at a time when less than a dozen laboratories were researching the protein's function in the human body. After graduating, Chen did a year of post-doctoral work with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.  Career  Following his post-doctoral work, Chen began working as a research scientist at Baxter Healthcare in Irvine, California. He then spent three years working as a senior scientist at biotech firm ProScript in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he developed assays that helped to identify and improve the cancer treatment Velcade. His time at ProScript allowed Chen to work in molecular biology and drug development and it was while working there that Chen started researching ubiquitin. Working with Tom Maniatis of Harvard University in 1996, Chen found that the enzyme kinase had to be \\"activated\\" by ubiquitin in order for the NF-Œ∫B signalling process to function properly. He decided pursuing his research into ubiquitin would be more suited for work in academia and left ProScript in 1997 to start a lab at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He currently holds the George L. MacGregor Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science and is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  Research  Chen's research initially focused on the role of ubiquitin in signaling pathways for the NF-Œ∫B protein complex, specifically as it pertains to immune response. At his lab in UT-Southwestern, Chen's group was able to show that ubiquitin marked proteins, marks that could be recognized by other proteins to create a \\"cascade\\" of signals. His research received grant funding from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund in 2002 enabling research into how NF-Œ∫B initiated immune responses to RNA viruses such as influenza and hepatitis C. This new line of research led to the discovery of MAVS (Mitochondrial Anti- Viral Signaling protein) and the role of mitochondria in antiviral innate immune responses, and the more recent discoveries of the cytosolic DNA sensor, Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS; cGAMP synthase), and a new second messenger, Cyclic guanosine monophosphate‚Äìadenosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, cGAMP), which play key roles in immune defense as well as autoimmune diseases. Honors and awards In 2018 Chen was awarded the Lurie Prize in Biomedical Sciences from the National Institutes of Health for his discovery of cGAS. Chen was awarded the 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for the discovery of the DNA-sensing enzyme cGAS and the pathways by which it activates innate immune responses. He shared the prize with C. Frank Bennett, Adrian R. Krainer, Angelika Amon, and Xiaowei Zhuang. He has also received the Norman Hackerman Award in Chemical Research, The Edith and Peter O‚ÄôDonnell Award in Science, and the National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2014.  References   External links  *Howard Hughes Medical Institute Bio *'Good' Prion-Like Proteins Boost Immune Response, Scientists Report.

Biography Cook was born on August 31, 1881 in Mount Tabor, Vermont. His mother died giving birth and he was raised by his aunt and uncle. He attended Dartmouth but did not graduate. Among his works are an important memoir about H. P. Lovecraft, originally published as In Memoriam: Howard Phillips Lovecraft (Driftwind Press, 1941).; Cook typset this himself. This memoir has been reprinted several times, including by Mirage Press in 1968 under the title H.P. Lovecraft: A Portrait. He also wrote stories about Vermont. He met Lovecraft through the National Amateur Press Association, and quickly became a champion of his weird fiction, some of which was first published in Cook's journal, The Vagrant. Cook also broadened Lovecraft's familiarity with supernatural literature by loaning him books and encouraging a systematic study of the field that resulted in Lovecraft's famous essay, \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature,\\" which was first published in Cook's The Recluse (1927).\\"Cook, W[illiam] Paul\\" in S.

The election used the eleven wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 40 Councillors being elected. The election saw the Scottish Labour Party gain 5 seats to regain an overall majority on the Council that they had lost at the time of the 2007 Local Elections, while also significantly increasing their vote. The Scottish National Party remained in second place on the Council but recorded a disappointing performance as the party lost 2 seats and saw a slight drop in its vote share. Both the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats declined in numbers to just 1 seat each. Meanwhile, Independent and former Labour Party member, Paul Mack, secured a seat on the Council. Following the election the Labour majority administration was formed.

It was created to oppose the 1969 amendments to the Criminal Code which restricted legal access to abortion. Members formed a caravan, emulating previous peripatetic protest movements, traveled from Vancouver to Ottawa and gathered support along the way. Hundreds of women across Canada engaged in protests at the Prime Minister's official residence, burning effigies and leaving a black coffin at the front door. These protests sparked wider debate and contributed to abortion laws being struck down in 1988. History In February 1970, members of the Vancouver Women's Caucus (VWC) (1968‚Äì1971) gathered to begin planning the Abortion Caravan, Canada's first national feminist protest. Many members of VWC were part of New Left organizations and were either students or worked on university campuses.Stettner, Shannon. ‚Äú ‚ÄòWe Are Forced to Declare War‚Äô: Linkages between the 1970 Abortion Caravan and Women‚Äôs Anti-Vietnam War Activism.‚Äù Histoire sociale/Social history 46, no. 92 (2013): 423-441. The Abortion Caravan was an opposition to the 1969 amendments to section 251 of the Criminal Code, which legalized abortion only in cases where pregnancy threatened the health of the mother. Under the amendment, abortions could only be performed by a licensed physician in an accredited hospital, and only after being approved by a therapeutic abortion committee (T.A.C.) which is a three- member panel of doctors. All other abortions, performed without the approval of a T.A.C. or in free-standing clinics, continued to be illegal and subject to criminal code sanctions.

In mid-April 1970 a delegation of the VWC set out from Vancouver in a yellow convertible, a pickup truck, and a Volkswagen bus with a black coffin strapped on the roof. Aimed at emulating the On-to-Ottawa Trek of the Depression era, the Abortion Caravan traveled from Vancouver to Ottawa, stopping in twelve communities to galvanize support.Sethna, Christabelle and Shannon Stettner. ‚ÄúThe Women Are Coming; The Abortion Caravan of 1970.‚ÄùActivehistory.ca.

A convoy of Canadian women, over five hundred strong in support, arrived - coat hangers and a black coffin in tow - to demand the legalization of unrestricted access to abortion services for all Canadian women. Participants of the Abortion Caravan declared \\"war on the Government of Canada\\", with hundreds of women from across Canada rallying for two days on Parliament Hill. At 24 Sussex Drive, the official residence of the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was burned in effigy. A black coffin adorned with coat hangers, representing women who had died from self- induced or back-alley abortions, was left at the Prime Minister's front door. On May 11, 1970, about 80 women donning black headscarves arrived at the House of Commons. The women surrounded the centennial flame carrying a black coffin. Approximately three dozen women, dressed in feminine attire, including heels and skirts, pantyhose and gloves, entered the House of Commons taking their seats in the various galleries circling the House. Once seated, the women quietly chained themselves to their seats, listening intently as, on the House floor, NDP MP Andrew Brewin asked the Minister of Justice John Turner if he would consider reviewing the abortion law; Turner said he doubted the law would be reviewed, closing discussion on the matter. Just before 3 p.m., one of the women rose from her seat in the gallery and began reciting the Abortion Caravan's prepared speech, interrupting debate on the floor of the House of Commons. As parliamentary guards approached the woman, a second woman stood up in another area of the gallery and continued to give the group's speech. One by one, the women rose from their seats, adding their voices to the group's speech and chanting \\"free abortions on demand\\". As Parliamentary guards moved through the galleries apprehending the protesters and forcibly removing the women from their seats, one woman reportedly \\"hurled a water bomb at the government benches before being rushed by security officers and marched from the building\\"; other women had their chains \\"removed by bolt-cutting guards and were heckled by onlookers as they were escorted from House\\". The gallery disturbance caused by activists served as the climax of the Abortion Caravan, provoking the first adjournment of Parliament in its 103-year history, shutting down the House of Commons for over an hour. The Abortion Caravan brought national attention to the opposition to the 1969 amendments and the movement for ‚Äúunrestricted access to legal abortion.‚ÄùStettner, Shannon and Christabelle Sethna, ‚ÄúReassessing the Abortion Caravan.‚Äù Activehistory.ca.

Bases promote this reaction. The reaction mechanism likely involves nucleophilic attack of the alpha-carbon of one acid group on the other acid group's carbonyl, possibly as a concerted reaction with the decarboxylation. The initial formation of an intermediate carbanion with decarboxylation from one acid group prior to the nucleophilic attack has been proposed, but is unlikely since the byproduct resulting from the carbanion's protonation by the acid has never been reported. This reaction is different from oxidative decarboxylation, which proceeds through a radical mechanism and is characterised by a different product distribution in isotopic labeling experiments with two different carboxylic acids. With two different carboxylic acids, the reaction behaves poorly because of poor selectivity except when one of the acids (for example, a small, volatile one) is used in large excess. Examples The dry distillation of calcium acetate to acetone was reported by Charles Friedel in 1858 and until World War I ketonization was the premier commercial method for its production. Ketonic decarboxylation of propanoic acid over a manganese(II) oxide catalyst in a tube furnace affords the 3-pentanone. Of commercial importance is the production of 3-pentanone from propionic acid with catalysts cerium(IV) oxide and manganese dioxide on alumina. 5-Nonanone, which is potentially of interest as a diesel fuel, can be produced valeric acid. The valeric acid in turn can be obtained from fructose. An example of intramolecular ketonization is the conversion of adipic acid to cyclopentanone with barium hydroxide. :400px References Category:Organic reactions ","title":"Ketonic decarboxylation"},{"id":"35485830","text":"Brian Allen Carr (born 1979 in Austin, Texas) is an American writer.

He made an unsuccessful challenge for the British Welterweight title in 1978 against Henry Rhiney and became Wales Welterweight champion in 1982, holding it until his retirement from the sport in 1984. Career Waith was born in Butetown in Cardiff, and was one of seven children. He was a successful amateur boxer and represented Wales in several tournaments, but after being passed over for the European Under-21 Championship he turned professional. Waith's first professional bout, fighting at featherweight, was on 19 October 1970 when he faced Mickey Vann in Aberavon; Waith won the fight by points decision. His career as a featherweight progressed well, losing just one of his first 19 fights, the majority of them being fought at the National Sporting Club in London. During this period he also recorded the first draw of his career, when he fought Dennis Flynn at the Empire Pool as an undercard fight to the Jos√© N√°poles vs Ralph Charles WBA World Welterweight contest. In June 1972, Waith travelled to South Africa for his first bout outside Britain. His opponent was South African lightweight champion Andries Steyn, in a ten-round fight in Johannesburg. The fight went the full ten rounds with Steyn taking the referee's decision. On his return to Britain, Waith entered a lightweight eliminator contest for a shot at the British title, facing Doncaster based fighter Howard Hayes at York Hall in London. Waith, who was floored during the contest, lost by a wide margin and decided to move out of the featherweight division. Waith had struggled with maintaining his weight, a factor that affected his entire career, and by 1973 he was turning out as a lightweight, beating Paul Bromley by points at the Top Rank Suite in Swansea. Later that year Waith travelled to South Africa again, this time facing ex-South African featherweight champions, and future WBA bantamweight champion Arnold Taylor. Waith recorded the same result as his first trip to South Africa, a points decision loss. Waith followed the loss with three wins, before being beaten by Erik Kinnien in Oslo.

Looney Tunes cartoon short directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on April 16, 1938, and stars Porky Pig. Porky sets sail for the Boola-Boola islands in the South Seas with a sailboat full of cargo and plans to open a five and dime store, until a swordfish cuts a hole in the hull. Plot Porky's sailboat is sailing off to the Boola-Boola islands, a fictitious set of tropical islands in the South Seas with enough cargo to open up a five and dime store. Thirteen days into the journey, Porky is writing in the Ship's Log that he is nearing land, \\"...I hope, I hope, I hope\\". A fish spots the Petunia coming his way and swims to the bottom of the ocean to tell his friends and says, \\"Hey guys, a ship is coming through!\\" (in fish-talk) and they all swim to near the surface, just under the boat. A swordfish comes along and cuts a hole in the bottom of the boat and all of Porky's goods fall to the bottom of the ocean! As Porky falls out too, the swordfish pushes him back into the boat and closes up the hole. The swordfish unscrews his \\"sword\\" from his face, and gives it to a nearby fish to stand guard (ensuring Porky doesn't try to open the hole again). Out of the sinking goods falls a lunchbox and when it hits bottom, opens up to form a canteen where a fish inside wearing a chef's hat is flipping burgers. A group of seahorses see a record player and as it starts playing, they swim onto the rotating record and form a merry-go-round. Smaller fish jump on their backs, imitating children on a ride. A fish swallows a teapot which whistles a tune while emitting steam and the opening and closing of the lid. Another fish swallows a clock with a moving pendulum and happily rubs his tummy. Then when he starts walking away, the pendulum starts swinging again. A different fish passes by making Hugh Herbert's noises (Woo-woo!) and drags a sign saying \\"FOO\\". As Porky lifts the hole cover to see what was happening (note, it opens inward now instead of outward, as before), he gets water squirted in his face by the sentry fish. Another fish swallows a radio and begins walking. As he walks, tuning sounds are made before the radio announcer (Mel Blanc) is speaking, the fish looks around for someone speaking and does not realize the sound is coming from the radio that he swallowed. The announcer describes how two giant bombers dropped a bomb on a small village, (Owasegoo - it sounds like gibberish, as it was apparently dubbed over after the cartoon's release), and the fish goes through all the motions of the bombing and gunfire sounds. As the shelling comes to a stop, the fish wipes sweat from his brow, only to have a program called \\"Gangster Busters\\" (a parody of Gang Busters) began playing including the sounds of police sirens and rapid-fire gunplay, and goes through all the motions again until he is bounced off the ocean floor which causes the radio to be up-chucked. Bowls and boxes are the next to follow, forming a hotel with a ballroom inside. Two electric eels swim by and form the marquee \\"Holly\\" and \\"wood\\" above the entrance and begin blinking on and off. Two other fish enter with flashlights on forming spotlights, as seen in front of hotels and theaters with big events and movie premiers in Hollywood that were common at the time. Two other fish have bowler hats drop on them, and as they turn toward the camera, acquire a likeness of Laurel and Hardy, and they swim into the Hotel. Another fish steps into some large shoes, and impersonates a Greta Garbo character and she says, \\"I want to be alone\\", a line in the 1932 classic Garbo movie \\"Grand Hotel\\". Another fish swallows a pair of lamps giving her a beautiful hourglass figure similar to that of Mae West, complete with jewels and parasol, and utters, \\"come up and see me sometime\\" as she struts into the Hollywood Legion Stadium to watch a boxing match between Gene Tuna (a play on the American Boxer Gene Tunney) versus the Champion. The two boxing fish were duking it out on the keys of a typewriter in the stadium, and as the carriage comes to the end of the line, the typewriter's ding is heard, and each fish backs into his own corner, and another fish pushes the carriage back to the beginning of a new line. The keys spell out what is happening in the fight. Back to Porky, he's now frowning because all of his goods have been lost, and puts a worm on a hook and lowers it into the water. The sentry fish sees this and pulls out his own fishing pole with baited hook and the worm jumps onto the hook and the sentry fish reels it in and eats it. Later, the ballroom guests are partying and waving their drinking glasses around when a spotlight appears on the curtain. As the curtain rises, we see some dancing legs and as the curtain rises further, it turns out to be a 10-legged octopus! (The crowd boos at the ugly performance.) The Mae West fish dances with something resembling a walrus or seal; her bustline and his waistline fit together perfectly as they dance. The fish that swallowed the clock relaxes as the pendulum keeps swinging inside his tummy. A whale appears under Porky's boat and the sentry fish knocks on the hole cover. As Porky opens the cover and says, \\"Who's there?\\" the whale spouts water from his blowhole, which forces Porky back onto the boat. But then, a tremendous waterspout is coming towards the ship and the vicinity beneath the sea. Back in the makeshift hotel, the fish were busy dancing and having a good time until the radio announcer interrupted temporarily for the news of the waterspout coming near the Boola Boola Islands. The fish ignored the news for a moment and resumed dancing until the announcer declared them to scram before the twister hits the area. And the sea creatures did, in their own fashionable way. The waterspout picked up the ship and vacuumed the lost contents out of the water until it died down and both the boat and cargo are safely back where they belong as Porky resumes his journey. The sentry fish spits water in disappointment, but Porky comes back and sprays him with a spritzer-bottle, and the fish starts crying and the cartoon comes to a close.

They are also known as Naddaf, and in Pakistan their preferred designation is Shaikh Mansoori.People of India Punjab Volume XXXVII edited by I.J.S. Bansal and Swaran Singh pages 353 to 357 Manohar  Origin  The Penja like many communities in India have acquired their name from their traditional occupation. In the case of the Penja, they were and many still are cotton carders and produce a coarse thread. They are said to be by origin members of the Teli caste who formed an endogamous sub-group when they changed their occupation from oil pressing to cotton carding. Historically, the Penja community was concentrated in what is now Indian or East Punjab, which led to the migration of the majority of the community to Pakistan at the time of the partition of India in 1947. A rump community is still found in the districts Ropar, Patiala and Sangrur. In Pakistan, the community is found mainly in Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Khanewal and Toba Tek Singh districts, and prefers to be known as Shaikh Mansoori or sometimes just Shaikh. The Penja speak Punjabi, but most who are now settled in Pakistan also speak Urdu. They are entirely Sunni, and are now fairly orthodox.  Present circumstances  The Penja historically practiced the custom of clan exogamy. This practice has now been discontinued. Their larger clans referred to as biradarus include the Raunji, Dedan, Phapute, Jand, Harim, Sohatte, Ahre, Kamboh, Bedham, Male Hans, Behlim, Alimi, Bhatti, Chauhan, Panwar and Gill. The Penja are strictly endogamous, but there are occasional marriages with the Teli community. Like most artisan castes, the Penja have seen a decline in their traditional occupation of cotton carding. With the spread of mechanized textile mills, the demand for their traditional coarse thread has disappeared. Many are now employed as agricultural labourers, with animal husbandry being an important subsidiary occupation. In India, the community has been granted Other Backward Class (OBC) status, which allows the community to avail benefits of the Government of India's affirmative action schemes.

It connects Vesterbrogade at V√¶rnedamsvej to Frederiksberg Runddel in front of the main entrance to Federiksberg Gardens. It was originally constructed in 1704 as the king's private road leading to his new summer residence, Frederiksberg Palace. It developed into the backbone of an entertainment district in the mid 18th century, and has continued to be associated with theatres until the present day. The avenue is lined with two double rows of linden trees and bisects Sankt Thomas Plads, a small round plaza, shortly after its departure from Vesterbrogade. History =The king's private road= Frederiksberg All√© on a map detail from 1772 The crown took over the area at the far end of Frederiksberg All√© after Ny Holl√¶nderby, a settlement of Dutch farmers which had been located at the site, had burned down in 1697, and a new summer residence for Frederick IV was built on a local hilltop between 1699 and 1703. Completed the following year, with inspiration from France, Frederiksberg All√© was established to provide the king a private road, a Route de Roi, between the main road out of Copenhagen's Western City Gate and his new palace with its extensive adjoining gardens. The new avenue was known as the king's new road as opposed to the king's old road Gammel Kongevej. =Country houses and villas= The Iron Gate at Frederiksberg All√© A number of country houses for wealthy Copenhageners were built along the north site of the avenue in the years after 1780, such as Sommerro, Vennersly, Sans Souci and All√©enberg. In 1785 King Christian VII installed a large iron gate at the site where the avenue diverged from Vesterbrogade. Apart from the king only the new land owners were given a key. A royal at the Iron Gate, c. 1800 Frederiksberg All√© was finally opened to private traffic in 1833. The iron gate was dismantled in 1862 and later installed at S√∏ndermarken's entrance on the corner of Pile All√© and Roskildevej. The south side of the street had long remained more open but in the years after 1850 it was built over with private villas. =An entertainment area= The Sommerlyst establishment in 1869 The area outside Frederiksberg Palace gardens had thrived as a fashionable destination for excursions ever since the construction of the palace in the first decade of the 18th century. When Frederiksberg All√©, as well as the palace gardens were opened to the public, and Copenhagen's fortifications were decommissioned, allowing for more robust constructions outside the city, numerous pleasure gardens and entertainment establishments sprung up along the street. One of the most popular places was Sommerlyst, a large pleasure garden which opened in 1834 at the end of Frederiksberg All√©. It had pavilions, flower beds, a merry-go-round, ferris wheels and a bandstand. The Alhambra complex Further down the street. Georg Carstensen, after leaving Tivoli Gardens which he had founded in 1843, opened a large entertainment complex in Moorish style named Alhambra in 1857. It contained the largest concert hall in Copenhagen which seated 2,000. It was never a success and the buildings were torn down in 1870. Another concert hall, Odeon, which opened the same year as Alhambra, was converted into the Frederiksberg Entertainment Theatre in 1869. Sommerlyst's old main building was torn down in 1855 and replaced with a larger one which contained a theatre and concert space. It was designed by H. C. Stilling who had also worked for Tivoli and Alhambra. Frederiksberg All√© on an undated drawing Other popular venues were Valhalla, Schweizer Pavillon, Sankt Thomas and Rosenfryd. They all combined dining with female singers and various other forms of entertainment. Located in one of the former country houses, Sankt Thomas had an anatomic museum and waxworks in a lateral wing, and in 1897 added sports to the palette of entertainment when Magnus Bech-Olsen became a world champion in wrestling by defeating the Turkish Sultan's court wrestler. =20th century= The beginning of Frederiksberg All√© from Vesterbrogade Institut Jeanne d'Arc photographed shortly after its completion in 1924 At the turn of the century, time ran out for the pleasure gardens and Frederiksberg All√© started to change character. The country houses and villas were pulled down and replaced with denser developments, mostly apartment buildings, although theatres continued to characterize the area. The F√∏nix Theatre opened in 1919. Frederiksberg Entertainment Theatre was, after for a while serving as a cinema, from 1917 to 1943 owned by the actress Betty Nansen and is now named the Betty Nansen Theatre after her. The ABC Theatre opened at No. 80 in 1949 and developed into one of the most important venues for revues in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of Stig Lommer. In 1924 a Roman Catholic girls school, the Institut Jeanne d'Arc, was built at No. 74. During Second World War when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany, the school was accidentally bombed on 21 March 1945 in Operation Carthage, a British air raid which targeted the Gestapo headquarters in the Shell House in the city centre, killing 86 school children. Buildings No. 104 No. 23, on the corner with Kingosgade, is known as Little Rosenborg due to its Neo-Renaissance style with two small towers and rich decorations, although its resemblance to Christian IV's Rosenborg Castle can hardly be described as striking. It was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt¬¥in collaboration with Christian V. Nielsen and completed in 1857. No. 104, on the corner of All√©gade, was completed in 1871 to designs by Johan Schr√∏der and was listed in 1978. Frederiksberg All√© today One of the most modern addresses in Frederiksberg, and in Copenhagen, Frederiksberg All√© is today known for its upmarket boutiques and caf√©s.

See notes in the 1825 edition of Livy by Arnold Drakenborch and Johann Freinsheim, p. 402.) were games (ludi) held in ancient Rome in honor of the di inferi, the gods of the underworld. They were not part of a regularly scheduled religious festival on the calendar, but were held as expiatory rites religionis causa, occasioned by religious concerns.John H. Humphrey, Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing (University of California Press, 1986), p. 543; Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 82. Ludi Taurii are recorded in 186 BC as a two-day event.Livy, 39.22. Varro mentions them as occurring in the late Republic.Varro, De lingua latina 5.154. During the reign of Antoninus Pius, they were held every five years from 140 to 160 AD, within a period beginning on the day after the Ides of May and continuing through the Kalends of June.CIL xiv supp. 4541 (the Fasti Ostienses); John Briscoe, A Commentary on Livy, Books 38‚Äì40 (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 19, 294; Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 544. Some scholars extrapolate that like the lustrum (purification ritual), the Ludi Taurii were regularly quinquennial.Eckart K√∂hne, \\"Bread and Circuses: The Politics of Entertainment,\\" in Gladiators and Caesars: The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome (University of California Press, 2000), p. 9; Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 543. Others caution that the five-year schedule under Antoninus Pius, attested by the Fasti Ostienses, is never mentioned in other sources. The limited evidence suggests the Ludi Taurii were important mainly in the context of religious revivalism during the Augustan and Antonine eras.Briscoe, A Commentary on Livy, p. 294; Humphrey, Roman Circuses, pp. 543‚Äì544. The Taurian Games were horse races, or less likely chariot races, on a course around turning posts (metae).Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 544; Varro, De lingua latina 5.154: \\"the horses run around the turning posts\\" (equi circum metas currunt). In the 19th century, they were sometimes confused with the archaic Tarentine Games (ludi tarentini), which were replaced by the Saecular Games.In 1875 and subsequent editions, Leonhard Schmitz's entry on the Ludi Saeculares in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (SMIGRA) identified the Taurian Games with the ludi tarentini. The identification gained currency in English classicizing literary circles, as indicated in the notes to Edward Lytton's translation of Horace's Saecular Ode, published in Schiller and Horace (Routledge, 1875), pp. 423‚Äì424, citing a then-current edition of Smith's Dictionary. By the 1890 edition of SMIGRA, a separate entry for Ludi Taurii had been added, with a few points of dubious factuality (see Bill Thayer's note to the entry Ludi Saeculares in the LacusCurtius edition of the 1875 SMIGRA, as well as his translation of and note to the entry Taurii Ludi in Daremberg and Saglio, Dictionnaire des Antiquit√©s Grecques et Romaines). The erroneous identification was nevertheless perpetuated in the Century Dictionary of 1891 (pp. 6189, 6199) and later editions. As early as 1701, however, Thomas Dempster had pointed out in his notes to the Antiquitatum Romanorum Corpus Absolutissimum of Johannes Rosinus that \\"many confuse the Taurian with the Saecular games, but they are in error: [the two] are entirely different\\" (p. 340). Ludwig Preller recognized the similarities, but suggested that the ludi taurii were performed irregularly when the Saecular Games would have been untimely; R√∂mische Mythologie (1881), vol. 1, p. 92. Horse racing along with the propitiation of underworld gods was characteristic of \\"old and obscure\\" Roman festivals such as the Consualia, the October Horse, and sites in the Campus Martius such as the Tarentum (where the ludi tarentini originated) and the Trigarium.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouch√©-Leclercq, Manuel des Institutions Romaines (Hachette, 1886), p. 549; \\"Purificazione,\\" in Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum (LIMC, 2004), p. 83. See also the Lusus Troiae. The Ludi Taurii were the only games held in the Circus Flaminius.Varro, De lingua latina 5.154; Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), 83; Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 543. Valerius Maximus (1.7.4) is the only ancient source, likely erroneous, to say that the Plebeian Games were held in the Circus Flaminius, which had no track for the chariot races known to be part of these ludi; see T.P. Wiseman, Remus: A Roman Myth (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211. If the games are Etruscan in origin, as Festus and Servius claim, taurii probably comes from the Etruscan word tauru, \\"tomb.\\"Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 544. The design of the turning posts (metae) on a Roman race course was derived from Etruscan funerary monuments.Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 15. Festus, however, offers an etiology based on Latin taurus, \\"bull.\\"Humphrey, Roman Circuses, p. 544. Origin and significance In the tradition recorded by Festus,Festus, excerpts of Paulus, p. 479 in the edition of Lindsay. the games were instituted in the Regal period when Tarquinius Superbus was king. Servius also places their origin during his reign. Festus explains that the games were performed in honor of the gods below (di inferi). They were established in response to an epidemic (magna ‚Ä¶ pestilentia) afflicting pregnant women, caused by the distribution of the flesh of sacrificial bulls (tauri) among the people. Servius implies that the pestilentia was infant mortality: \\"each delivery of the women came out badly.\\" The remedy of the games was obtained ex libris fatalibus, \\"from the books of the fates\\" (either the Sibylline booksBriscoe, A Commentary on Livy, p. 294; Auguste Bouch√©-Leclercq, Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquit√© (J√©r√¥me Millon, 2003 reprint, originally published 1883), p. 1024. or Etruscan textsBouch√©-Leclercq, Histoire de la divination, p. 1024.). According to Servius, the ludi took their name from the word taurea, meaning a sterile sacrificial victim (hostia).Servius Danielis, note to Aeneid 2.140. Servius gives an alternative version that credits the Sabines with instituting the games in response to the pestilentia, and characterizes the transferral of the lues publica (the plague upon the people) onto sacrificial victims (hostiae) as if it were a scapegoat ritual.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 176; Servius, note to Aeneid 2.140 (alii ludos Taureos a Sabinis propter pestilentiam institutos dicunt, ut lues publica in has hostias verteretur). Festus also provided an additional explanation of the name as taurus (\\"bull\\") from Varro,Festus, p. 478 (Lindsay). preserved only in fragmentary form by the Codex Farnesianus.Briscoe, A Commentary on Livy, p. 294. A reconstruction dating back to J.J. ScaligerSed Taurios ludos Varro ait vocari, quod eis ludis discipulus pendens a doctore in crudo corio tauri solitus sit inpelli, atque usque eo inibi cogi docere, quoad consisteret atque virtute talorum constaret pedum firmitas (italicized text is reconstructed); in English, \\"Varro, however, says that the Taurian Games are so called because it was customary at the games for a student, with a boost from his instructor, to be propelled on the raw hide of a bull (taurus), and to show by the extent of his action how sound he was and how the sureness of his feet 'stuck' by virtue of his heels.\\" (\\"Stick\\" here is used in the sense of landing a gymnastics position correctly.) See Andr√© Dacier (1826), pp. 960‚Äì961. has been taken to mean that youths, under the direction of a coach, engaged in ritual gymnastics on a raw bull's hide, perhaps to be compared to exercises on a trampoline.J.D. Guigniaut on Fr√©d√©ric Cruezer, Religions de l'antiquit√© (Paris, 1851) vol. 3, p. 1122. This view has not attracted wide acceptance, but would suggest that the ritual action countervails infant mortality by affirming the fitness of the youth. Ritually, landing on the bull's skin may mimic the \\"catching\\" of a safely delivered newborn.For more on birthing in the Roman world, see Midwifery#History_of_midwifery and the birth deities the Nixae, whose altar was located within a complex of sites associated with horse races and underworld gods in the Campus Martius. The Augustan historian Livy has a brief reference to the games as occurring in 186 BC per biduum, for a period of two days, religionis causa, \\"for the sake of religious scruple.\\" On this occasion, the two-day Ludi Taurii preceded ten days of ludi presented by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior as the result of a vow in the Aetolian War. Nobilior's games are notable as the first time a beast hunt (venatio) was staged at Rome. At a corrupt transition between the two events in Livy's text, the word decem (\\"ten\\") appears, which Georg Wissowa construed as referring to the ten-member priestly college of decemviri sacris faciundis; he thought these priests were likely charged with organizing the Taurian Games.Georg Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der R√∂mer (Munich, 1902), p. 388; noted also by Briscoe, A Commentary on Livy, pp. 294‚Äì295. Earlier scholars have sometimes taken the adjective taurii to mean that bulls were part of the games, either in a Mediterranean tradition of bull-leaping, or as an early form of bullfighting.Arnold Drakenborch in his 1825 edition of Livy took the Taurilia as involving actual bull fights (p. 400). See also Guigniaut on Cruezer, Religions de l'antiquit√©, p. 1122ff. Because Livy's chronology places the Ludi Taurii (or in some editions Taurilia) immediately after the news of a victory in Roman Spain, the games have figured in a few efforts to trace the early history of Spanish- style bullfighting.For instance, Edward Clarke, Letters concerning the Spanish Nation (London, 1763), pp. 113‚Äì115. The effort was derided by Charles Sumner, \\"Spanish Bull-Feasts and Bull-Fights,\\" Quarterly Review (1839), p. 385ff., published anonymously and attributed to Sumner by Edward L. Pierce, Memoirs and Letters of Charles Sumner (Boston, 1893), vol. 2, p. 64.

Introduced as a Private Member's Bill, it reduced the legislative burden on newspaper proprietors with regard to the offence of libel; as a quid pro quo, the compulsory registration of proprietors (abolished by the Newspapers, Printers, and Reading Rooms Repeal Act 1869) was reintroduced. Following the removal of compulsory registration in 1869, newspaper owners had begun to look to anonymity as a protection against lawsuits arising out of the publication of libellous statements. At the same time, the judgment in Purcell v Sowler (1877) saw a newspaper proprietor successfully sued despite recognition that the libellous statements his newspaper had published were merely quoted verbatim from the testimony of a member of the public made at public meeting. Against this backdrop, two successive select committees were established to look at the law of libel; the first made no report, but the second took on the evidence of the first, and made several recommendations. In the words of John Hutchinson, MP for Halifax, \\"the Bill embodied the recommendations of [the second] Committee, and was confined to them exclusively\\". The bill itself took the form of a Private Member's Bill. In terms of content, section 2 of the Act (as it became when it received royal assent on 27 August 1881) introduced a new defence for newspaper proprietors in cases where the libel stemmed from a fair, accurate and non-malicious report of a publicly held meeting. This extension of qualified privilege was then \\"amplified\\" by the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, which in doing so repealed section 2 of the 1881 Act. Repealed at the same time was section 3 (\\"No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General\\"). The Act also benefited newspaper owners insofar as it instituted provisions (section 4, 5 and 6) for the quicker (and hence cheaper) resolution of newspaper libel cases. Contrary to expectations, however, the passage of the Act correlated with an increase, rather than decrease, in the number of defamatory libel (criminal) actions being brought against newspapers. Whether the two were causally linked is not known, however. In return, proprietors were happy to accept the reintroduction of compulsory registration that had been removed in 1869 (now provided for by sections 7 to 15 of the 1881 Act inclusive). These registration clauses, which included an exemption for proprietors who are already registered companies, were not repealed until 2015 and were still enforced. For the purposes of the Act, a newspaper is defined as \\"any paper containing public news, intelligence, or occurrences, or any remarks or observations therein printed for sale, and published ... periodically, or in parts or numbers at intervals not exceeding 26 days\\". As of 2009, 56 newspapers and their proprietors were centrally registered as a result of these provisions. Under section 19 of the Act, it never applied to Scotland. The provisions on registration in sections 7 to 18 were repealed by the Deregulation Act 2015 as being no longer of practical use.Deregulation Act 2015, Schedule 23. As a result, only section 4 remains in force, and that only in relation to Northern Ireland and courts hearing charges there of blasphemous libel.

The novel was first published by Orchard Books in 1995. Poppy is the first- published of Avi's Tales From Dimwood Forest series. Within the narrative sequence of the series, it is the second book. The complete series is composed of Poppy, Poppy and Rye, Ragweed, Ereth's Birthday, Poppy's Return, and Poppy and Ereth. In 1996, Poppy received the Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award for fiction.  Background  Avi conceived the idea for Poppy while living in Corvallis, Oregon, when his wife was a visiting professor at Oregon State University. At a university bookstore, he found a book written by a naturalist, who described his experience rescuing a baby owlet and nurturing it back to health and into the wild. Avi found the book \\"fascinating\\" and decided to write his own novel about an owl named Mr. Ocax. While developing the story, however, Avi's interest shifted towards the mouse that Mr. Ocax planned to eat, and the mouse eventually became the primary focus of the book. Both the book and the mouse were originally named Pip, but after discovering that another children's book existed about a mouse named Pip, he decided to rename the book and the character to Poppy. Plot In the Dimwood region, a large family of mice inhabit an abandoned farmhouse called Gray House. Poppy, a young deer mouse, dances with her boyfriend Ragweed, a golden mouse, on Bannock Hill. However, Mr. Ocax, a great horned owl who acts as a tyrannical ruler over the family, tries to catch both of the mice while they are distracted. Ocax only manages to scratch Poppy's nose, but he kills and eats Ragweed. When Poppy returns to Gray House, she learns that the family must relocate to New House, where the food is more abundant. However, Ocax refuses to give the family permission to move to the area, citing Poppy and Ragweed's refusal to ask his permission to go to Bannock Hill. His refusal makes Poppy curious, so she decides to travel to New House herself. In Dimwood Forest, Poppy stumbles upon Ereth, a porcupine who, contrary to the stories of porcupines that Ocax told Poppy's family, does not eat mice. Ereth protects Poppy from Ocax in exchange for the salt lick at New House that he can't obtain on his own. Ereth drops Poppy off at the boundaries of New House, where Poppy discovers that Ocax is afraid of a large artificial owl there. Armed with one of Ereth's quills, Poppy confronts Ocax about the figure but inadvertently reveals that it is fake. Ocax then attacks Poppy but is eventually defeated when Poppy stabs him with the quill. In a desperate attempt to get rid of it, he slams into the salt lick pole, killing him and causing the salt lick to fall to the ground. Ereth retrieves the salt lick, and Poppy goes home to tell her family they were now free from Ocax and able to move. A few moons later she meets and marries Rye, Ragweed's brother. They have eleven kids and each night they freely dance on Bannock Hill. Reception In 1996, Poppy received the Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award for fiction. In a 2017 blog post reflecting on Poppy, Avi wrote that Orchard Books, the original publisher of the book, had been \\"foundering\\", and as a result, bookstores were finding it difficult to obtain a copy of Poppy. Referring to the Horn Book Award, Avi wrote that it came in \\"the proverbial nick of time\\" and that he has \\"absolutely no doubt that the award saved Poppy\\", allowing him to write all the other books in the series. The novel was also listed on the American Library Association's (ALA) Notable Books for Children list in 1996. Carolyn Phelan, writing in the ALA's Booklist, called Poppy \\"a good old-fashioned story with an exciting plot, well-drawn characters, and a satisfying ending\\", noting themes of power among the novel's three main characters: Poppy, who finds courage; Ocax, who oppresses the mice family; and Ragweed, who criticizes Poppy for being cautious. Kirkus Reviews described Poppy as a \\"cute, but rather standard offering from Avi\\". The School Library Journal referred to it as a \\"fast-paced, allegorical animal story\\", commenting that \\"the underlying messages, to challenge unjust authority and to rely on logic and belief in oneself, are palatably blended with action and suspense.\\"  References   External links  *Poppy on the Avi Official Website * Category:1995 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:Children's novels about animals Category:Novels by Avi Category:Fictional mice and rats Category:1995 children's books ","title":"Poppy (novel)"},{"id":"35486435","text":"Emad Avar (, also Romanized as ‚ÄòEmƒÅd ƒÄvar; also known as ‚ÄòEmƒÅd ƒÄvard, EmƒÅd ƒÄvard, and A·∏©mad-e Vard) is a village in Azimiyeh Rural District, in the Central District of Ray County, Tehran Province, Iran.

These systems are commonly designed to convey information over multiple types of devices, from signal lights to text messaging to live, streaming video, forming a unified communication system intended to optimize communications during emergencies. Contrary to emergency notification systems, which generally deliver emergency information in one direction, emergency communication systems are typically capable of both initiating and receiving information between multiple parties. These systems are often made up of both input devices, sensors, and output/communication devices. Therefore, the origination of information can occur from a variety of sources and locations, from which the system will disseminate that information to one or more target audiences.  Emergency communication vs. notification  An emergency notification system refers to a collection of methods that facilitate the one-way dissemination or broadcast of messages to one or many groups of people with the details of an occurring or pending emergency situation. Mass automated dialing services such as Cell Broadcast, Reverse 911, as well as common siren systems that are used to alert for tornadoes, tsunamis, air-raid, and other such incidents, are examples of emergency notification systems. Emergency communication systems often provide or integrate those same notification services but will also include two-way communication‚Äîtypically to facilitate communications between emergency communications staff, affected people, and first responders. Another distinguishing attribute of the term \\"communication\\" may be that it implies the ability to provide detailed and meaningful information about an evolving emergency and actions that might be taken; whereas \\"notification\\" denotes a relatively more simplistic one-time conveyance of the existence and general nature of an emergency. = Alternate and related terms = Since there are a collection of related systems used in diverse settings in varying ways, there are numerous terms that are used interchangeably among the entities that use or have a need for emergency communication systems. In most instances, though, these are all used to refer to the same or substantially similar concepts. For example, use of the terms ‚Äúemergency communications‚Äù and ‚Äúdisaster communications‚Äù definitively refer to the same concept, with the only potential difference lying in the connotation or emotional meaning. * Emergency Notification * Emergency Notification System * Emergency Notification Service * Emergency Communications * Emergency Communications System * Emergency Communications Service * Emergency Response Software * Unified Emergency Communications * Emergency Warning System * Emergency Management System * Emergency Management Software * Alerting System * Emergency Alert * Emergency Alert System (not to be confused with EAS) * Emergency Alerting System * Notification System * Unified Communication System * Public Mass Notification * Public Notification System * Mass Notification * Mass Notification System * Network-centric emergency notification * Network- Centric Emergency Communication * Unified Emergency Communication System * Disaster Communication System * Emergency Public Warning System * Public Address System (audio) * Audiovisual Public Address System * Intercom System * Public Safety System * Public Security System  Need and limitations  Emergencies place demands on communication processes that are often significantly different from the demands of non-emergency circumstances. Emergencies often involve escalating and evolving events that demand high performance and flexibility from the systems that provide emergency communication services. Message prioritization, automation of communication, fast message delivery, communication audit trails, and other capabilities are often required by each unique emergency situation. Inadequate emergency communications capabilities can have consequences that are inconvenient at best and disastrous at worst. Depending on the location, time, and nature of the emergency, a large variety of limitations could present themselves when it comes to communicating details of an emergency and any resultant actions that may need to be taken to protect life and property. For example, an audio public address system might be rendered ineffective if the emergency happens to be an explosive event which renders most or all of those affected deaf. Another common example might be the limitation of a fire alarm's siren component in a deaf school. Yet another example of a limitation could be the overloading of public services (such as cellular phone networks), resulting in the delay of vital SMS messages until they are too late, such as occurred during the Boston Marathon bombing.  Attributes  =Timeliness and speed of delivery= Emergency systems require timely and quick dissemination in order to mitigate damage or loss of life. During the Virginia Tech massacre, about two hours had passed before the first communication (an email) was sent to staff and students. By that time, the gunman had already entered and secured a building in which he was shortly to begin his attack. It wasn't until about 20 minutes after the shootings began that a loudspeaker announcement was made for people to take cover. =Ease of use= During a crisis, the people who use an ECS need to quickly and easily launch their notifications and they need to be able to do so in a way that securely provides them with confidence and an intuitive, familiar and easy-to-use interface that can be accessed from any location. An emergency communication system that's designed for non-technical users will ensure successful administration and usage; and during some life-threatening emergency situations, campus administrators must be able to react quickly and trigger the alert system swiftly. Yet emergency alert is probably among the least used and least familiar processes. Ease-of-use therefore is critical to the effectiveness of an emergency communication system. However, in order to support a robust and capable emergency communication ability, this ease of use should not preclude the use of a complex, technologically advanced system. A sufficiently advanced system is required to coordinate multiple components to act in concert, to initiate and propagate emergency communications in any manner of ways. A distinguishing factor is when such a system includes these advanced capabilities, while still being easy for the user to operate. This is important not only for effective emergency communication, but also for an organization to realize the most return on investment, as well as the user being familiar enough with its operation as to effectively operate it under stressful emergency situations, such as in an earthquake or tsunami. =Providing instructions= A clearly needed attribute of any modern emergency communication system is the ability to not only provide notification of an emergency, but to also provide clear and actionable instructions for how to respond to an emergency. In a study by the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center for Wireless Technologies, it was revealed that regardless of the initial form of notification, a secondary form was necessary before action would be taken. This supports the important observation that providing clear and concise instructions may reduce dependency on such secondary verification; and thus, providing instructions may save lives in an urgent emergency situation. =Specific audiences or recipients= Emergencies often require delivery of different versions of the same communication at the same time. For example, in an armed hostage-taking incident, occupants of a building may need to receive instructions to lock and barricade the door until further notice, while first responders to the incident need to be aware of the lockdown instructions and be provided more specific details of the hostage-taking event to inform their actions. Using the hostage-taking example, some of the more modern emergency communication systems state the ability to deliver a single message that provides full details to first responders, while filtering that same message to provide more limited instructions to different groups. For example, a specific message could be sent to people in a certain area, in a specific building, or even in a specific department. By using a single message that segregates information between types of users, fewer messages have to be created and sent, which can also save time. =Multiple communication paths/redundancy= There should be multiple means of delivering emergency information so that if one fails, others may get through. Also, according to the Partnership for Public Warning, research shows clearly that more than one channel of communication will be consulted by people at risk in order to confirm the need for action. The public expects to be contacted in a variety of ways. As evidenced by various historical and recent events, besides phone calls and emails, citizens also expect to be able to use and be reached via text messaging, and fax. In one exemplary incident, the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting, barricaded victims relied on sending text messages for help, in addition to traditional phone calls. In addition, the public may look to social media as another vehicle to receive messages and check in on updates. Additionally, the Partnership for Public Warning states, ‚ÄúA single warning is frequently insufficient to move people to action, especially if it cannot be confirmed by direct observation. For most people the first warning received captures their attention and triggers a search for corroboration, but cannot be relied on to elicit the desired behavior. Scientific research supports the common-sense observation that people are disinclined to risk being fooled by a single alarm that might prove false or accidental. Effective warning requires the coordinated use of multiple channels of communication.‚Äù =Interoperability= A fire control system's RS-232 data connection which an emergency communication system may interface with To support these attributes, a \\"unified\\" emergency communication system should be able to connect to and communicate with other related systems, hence the term. According to the Partnership for Public Warning, a fundamental problem is the lack of technical and procedural interoperability among warning originators, system providers, delivery systems, and warning recipients. Originators of warnings must undertake expensive, redundant tasks using multiple, dissimilar tools and techniques to take full advantage of today's warning systems. Also, there are multiple ways that an emergency communication system might obtain an original warning. One example of this might be the case of a building's fire control system dispatching a notice that a smoke detector has activated. A properly designed emergency communication system should be able to receive that notice and process it into a message that the building's occupants can understand and take action on in order to save life and property. Another example might be of the National Weather Service sending an EAS severe weather warning (e.g. via RSS feed or similar). Modern emergency communication systems include the capability to subscribe to such source feeds, so that those responsible for disseminating the message have the most up-to-date information. The ability to interoperate should also consider the need to be both forward and backward compatible with older and yet-to-be-conceived technologies. Introduction of a system that cannot interoperate with previously deployed equipment creates potentially serious barriers to effective operation. =Affordability= Because of budgetary constraints, for many organizations, the affordability of an emergency communication system can be just as important as the system's capabilities and effectiveness. The purchase and installation of enough emergency communication devices to provide multiple methods of communication to many locations within an organization in order to deliver location-specific instructions and for redundancy can be very expensive. Many organizations, therefore, are looking for more economical emergency communication solutions. Overall, the more affordable it is to procure, install, and maintain an emergency communication system, the more prolific such systems may become, and the more prolific these systems are, the more likely it is that these systems will be available to aid in times of emergency in more locations. According to Federal Signal, beyond supporting emergency response, today's mass notification systems have proven to be a valuable asset for everyday, non- emergency, intra- and inter-plant communications. This has become particularly evident in the deployment of interoperable, multi-device communications technology that not only enhances overall plant communications, but provides a host of useful software-based management and administrative tools. Additionally, many of the more traditional approaches to mass notification, i.e., public address and intercom systems, e-mail, and voice and text messaging, provide everyday functionality for plant communications and process control that represents attractive potential for return on investment. =Product versus service= An emergency communication system may be composed of a product and its associated hardware and software, as owned by the entity using it (e.g., an on-site paging network), or as a service owned and provided by a third-party (e.g., a cellular carrier's SMS network). Each have their own advantages and disadvantages; however, despite perception otherwise, services have some major inherent problems when it comes to effective emergency communications. For instance, using SMS as one example, due to the architecture of cellular networks, text messaging services would not be able to handle a large volume of communications in a short period of time, making this particular type of service a potentially ineffective emergency communication method. =Premises based versus non-premises based= Premises based emergency communication systems are those which primarily or wholly exist in the same geographical or structural area as it serves, while non- premises based emergency communication systems are those which exist in a different geographical or structural area. There are advantages and disadvantages of each. Often, non-premises based systems are slower than those that are premises-based, because at the very least, the different locations need to be connected via (usually public) data networks, which may be susceptible to disruption or delay. History Early civil defense type of siren With the growth of populations and the evolution of technology, the methods for communicating emergency situations have also changed, as has the definition for what might constitute an ‚Äúemergency.‚Äù These methods would also very likely depend on a particular region's culture and location, as well. =Early systems= In America's formative years, common means of emergency communications may have mostly consisted of church bells being rung or messengers on horseback. Later, as technology developed, the telegraph became a nearly instant method of communicating. From there, radio communications, telephones and sirens became commonplace. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, by the Japanese in 1941, Civil Defense sirens became popular and resulted in their widespread use in military bases and towns across America. A particular weakness of these systems is that they largely lack the ability to inform people what they should do. Fire alarm systems were first developed around the late 1800s and other related life-safety detectors associated with those systems (e.g., duct detectors, heat detectors, etc.) were developed around the early 1900s. These constitute the first automated systems used in public and private buildings that are in normal and widespread use today. These systems, although originally designed for fire, have also been used for many other types of emergencies, sometimes effectively and sometimes not. For instance, if a fire alarm has been activated (as a general warning device) during an active shooter incident, the typical reaction to evacuate may not be the safest course of action; instead, a shelter in place action may be better. As an example, during the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, a mass shooting event that happened at the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, the assailant began targeting victims as they attempted to exit the theater; in which case, it would have been unwise to heed the fire alarm, that was sounding, and evacuate. =Modern systems= Today, modern communication tools such as smartphones, flat-panel digital signage, GPS, and text-to-speech (among many others) are changing the way in which people are notified about emergencies. Of added value, with these more modern tools, is the ability to provide more specific instructions. Now, instead of merely notifying people about an emergency, it is possible to provide specific instructions on what to do in order to mitigate the effects of an emergency. Furthermore, those instructions might even be customized for those peoples' specific and unique circumstances. For example, smart-phones may have geo-location abilities that would allow a map to be shown of safe locations (and perhaps routing there- to), relative to those devices' specific users ‚Äî all with a singular alert being sent as the source of those warnings. Modern implementations directed at personal devices allow for acknowledgement of receipt. This way emergency services can gain insight on message reception and tally users that have reached safety.  Broadcast technologies  Short-wave RadioPerhaps the oldest or most basic forms of public communication are staples such as over- the-air television, sirens, and radio. More modern components (using the same concept) might include lights and Giant Voice systems. These all have one thing in common: they broadcast indiscriminately to anyone who has the means to receive the message; whether they are simply in the immediate area or require some sort of receiving device. Broadcast technologies use point-to- point communications methodology and may either require infrastructure or not. Examples of broadcast technologies requiring infrastructure might include such things as Reverse 911 and broadcast-affiliate networks. =Infrastructure- independent= Broadcast technologies that do not depend on man-made infrastructure to convey communication may be least susceptible to disruption during disasters and emergencies. Some examples of infrastructure-independent technologies are: * Short-wave Radio :Short-wave (or Amateur) radio is a relatively long range method of communicating using radio waves. Because of the nature of radio wave propagation, communications made via short-wave radio can be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment and knowledge. However, due to their reliance only on electrical power (which can be obtained via batteries, solar, and other alternative means) and Earth's ionosphere, they are ideal for some of the worst case emergency scenarios. One disadvantage may be that one requires training and licensing to transmit using a short-wave radio, in many countries. * Two-way Radio :Two-way radio consists of at least two devices (typically portable and hand-held) that are capable of transmitting and receiving communications to each other, using radio waves. Similar to short-wave, this type of communication is also able to be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment. However, unlike short-wave, this communication equipment is restricted by range (usually several miles, at most), but is relatively simple to operate and the main power source is usually provided by batteries. Two-way radios are in-use by many emergency responders on a daily basis, so they require minimal concentration to operate in the stress of an emergency situation, since the person operating it is already familiar with it. Additionally, many non- professionals may use unlicensed two-way radios, as is common with CB radio, Family Radio Service or PMR446. * Weather Radio :A weather radio is a device which receives normal and emergency weather broadcasts. It may automatically turn on whenever an emergency is eminent or occurring, providing an alarm as well as a description of the situation. Anyone with a weather radio device can receive these broadcasts. * Internet Based Communication : There is increasingly an opportunity to use infrastructure-independent network connection, sometimes called Network-centric emergency notification, for emergency communication. The emergence of initiatives such as Google's Project Loon offer opportunities for networked communication when infrastructure- dependent communication is hindered in emergency situations. Each device has its own pros and cons given the emergency situation. =Infrastructure- dependent= Audio public address speakers Broadcast technologies that depend on man-made infrastructure to convey communication are susceptible to disruption if any part of that infrastructure is overloaded, damaged or otherwise destroyed. Some examples of infrastructure-dependent technologies are: * Audio Public Address Systems :A system which can provide audio (usually spoken language) messaging capability, usually consisting of microphone devices, wiring, and speakers installed in public areas of buildings. These systems are typically located indoors or in smaller outdoor areas with multiple speakers, due to their speakers' individual volume being too limited for large areas. Usually connected together by wiring requiring electricity, these systems may be vulnerable to electrical disruption or any other event which results in the wires being severed or disconnected. * WMT Public Address Systems Wireless Mobile Telephony (WMT) PA Systems refers to PA paging and [intercom] systems that use any form of Wireless Mobile Telephony System such as GSM networks instead of a centralized amplifier to distribute the audio signal to paging locations across a building or campus, or other location. The GSM mobile Networks are used to provide the communication function. At the transmission end, a PSTN Telephone, mobile phone, VOIP phone or any other communication device that can access and make audio calls to a GSM based mobile SIM card can communicate with it. At the receiving end, a GSM transceiver receives these network transmissions and reproduce the analogue audio signal via a Power Amplifier and speaker. The work on this was pioneered by Stephen Robert Pearson of Lancashire, England who successfully applied for and was granted patents for the systems which incorporate control functionality in addition to the audio announcement capabilities. The use of the WMT (GSM) networks means that live announcements can be made from anywhere to anywhere in the world where there is WMT connectivity. The patents cover all forms of WMT i.e. 2G, 3G, 4G ..... xxG. A UK company called Remvox Ltd (REMote VOice eXperience) has been appointed under license to develop and manufacture products based upon this technology.LED sign, in a wall-mounted orientation, depicting an emergency and the resulting action that should be taken to mitigate the emergency * L.E.D. Electronic Signs :LED electronic signs use light-emitting diodes to display messages when connected over a network to an emergency communication system. LED signs, when deployed in large numbers on a network, can be used as visual alternatives to traditional audio public address systems. LED Signs are able to communicate effectively in loud environments where audio PA systems can be ineffective. When deciding whether or not to include LED electronic signs as part of an emergency communication system, it is important to realize that a lack of hearing- impaired persons does not negate the need for visual signs. Explosions and other events can render many hearing-able people effectively deaf, necessitating the inclusion of a visual alternative to audio PA systems. LED electronic signs have multiple valuable attributes that enhance public communications: :* Some emergency communication systems can deliver, share, and prioritize the display of messages on LED signs that have been sent by multiple people and systems. :* LED signs, when connected to an emergency communication system, have the ability to project the communication in a specific direction while loud speakers generally radiate communication in many directions. :* LED signs are manufactured in a large variety of shapes and sizes, with some models designed specifically for indoor use and very bright models designed for outdoor use. :* Because LEDs consume very little electricity, power over Ethernet (PoE) and power over RS232 can be used in conjunction with UPS power located in wiring closets to keep these devices functioning for a significant period of time during a general power outage in a building. :* Like audio PA systems, visual PA systems composed of LED signs are network-attached appliances that, unlike computer screen popup messages (more information about this technology, below), text messages, phone calls, etc., represent \`Always On\` technologies, which can be relied on to deliver the communication in real time without the risk that the device might be off, in use, or out of power. :* LED signs are available that can display messages in a single color, red-green-yellow characters, or full color, which allows for color coding of emergency messages when desired. These types of signs can be relatively affordable compared to digital signs and are easy to install, making them a common choice for organizations wishing to use electronic forms of visual communication. Common means of connecting these devices include Ethernet or serial communication cabling. :* In combination with audio PA systems, these devices can be used to achieve compliance with the ADA requirements for equal access to communications. :Government, public and private entities may use LED electronic signs for any purpose ranging from advertising to emergency management. For emergency use of these types of signs, it is often necessary to electronically control them in a unified and coordinated manner, using one of or a mixture of specialized hardware and software. There exist at least a few commercial methods that advertise this capability, for example Siemens Sygnal, Inova Solutions, and MessageNet Connections. * Combination Audio/Visual Public Address Devices :Any device which combines the audio capability of a PA system with the visual capability of an electronic sign (usually of the L.E.D. variety). These, too, rely on infrastructure to operate. LCD digital sign * Digital Signage :Throughout the first decade of the twenty-first century, plasma televisions and other flat- panel LCD televisions and monitors have become commonplace in businesses, hospitals, schools, post-secondary institutions, government, airports, shopping malls, and financial institutions, etc.; with that prominence, they have begun to play a major role in emergency communications. Similar to combination audio/visual PA devices, yet much more advanced, digital signage monitors are capable of displaying high-resolution videos, pictures, multimedia presentations, text and other high-definition media. Typically digital signage can provide video, audio, presentation graphics and web page content abilities that can support the communication of an emergency. In addition, the graphical multimedia capabilities of digital signage can enable emergency wayfinding or egress routing that can be customized to the event and location of the emergency and the affected people. :Digital signage is often more expensive than relatively simple LED electronic signs, which makes it more sensible to garner as much utility from it as possible for maximum return on investment. Over time, though, this technology has become more affordable, resulting in digital signage being used in more venues, usually for non- emergency purposes such as displaying news, weather, directions, etc. Other emerging uses of digital signage related to emergency communication systems include: displaying building floorplans, maps, evacuation routes, and first responder situational awareness (such as showing a firefighter where a fire has been detected). :Emergency communication systems and digital signage are integrated in many verticals including outdoor, in retail spaces, in hospitals and clinics. More recently, smart city companies are using prominent screens around the urban landscape to convey critical messages to the city's population. These emergency systems have technical integrations where the emergency message will interrupt and override any advertisements currently playing or scheduled. * Giant Voice Systems :A system focused on providing auditory messaging capability for large outdoor areas, being able to project voice and sounds over large distances, without the need for a large number of speakers. These systems are commonly used on military bases and chemical manufacturing plants, for example. These technologies allow specific instructions to be broadcast over a large area, however they may be subject to substantial echo and weather-related effects; and furthermore, environmental noise may interfere with their effectiveness. This forces unnatural speech, on the part of the warning originator, and may render the communication difficult for the listener to comprehend. This fact has prompted some to primarily rely on tones and coded signals that the audience must be familiar with in advance. Even though these can be heard over a large area, the high-powered speakers require a connection to the communication originator via some sort of infrastructure, meaning they might have a certain level of vulnerability to disruption in the collection infrastructure. The alternative to the use of Giant Voice systems is to deploy large arrays of smaller lower power speakers, this approach also allows for greater specificity of message by location. When properly synchronized these speaker arrays can deliver more comprehensible speech, however these arrays will involve larger amounts of supporting infrastructure. Siemens and Federal Signal are two of the major commercial providers of Giant Voice systems being actively deployed at military bases, government facilities and industry, currently; with Federal Signal being one of the first providers of these types of systems, after the Pearl Harbor attack.  Communication devices  There are primarily two major types of communication devices: those for individual people and those for groups of people. Public Communication Devices are the devices that are designed to deliver a communication to more than one person as a single process at the same time. Examples include a digital electronic sign, a loud speaker that is part of a PA system, or a large flat panel display on a wall. A private communication device is a device that is designed to deliver communication to one person at a time through a single process. Typically, a single person is in control of such a device which is usually not shared. Examples include a cell phone, a text message on the cell phone, an email, or a message over a 2 way radio. =Public and shared devices= Public communication refers to the conveyance of messages to people, in such a way that anyone may receive the communication at nearly the same time as anyone else, typically using a common device. The most common way of facilitating public communications is by using devices that are incorporated into some public venue, such as public-address systems or digital signage. Using public devices for the purpose of public warning empowers people at risk to take actions to reduce losses from natural hazards, accidents, and acts of terrorism. =Private devices= \\"Private\\" means the delivery of messages to a specific individual, in a private manner or in such a way that even those nearby may not get the message. Common ways of facilitating private communications involve devices such as telephones or electronic mail. Example of an emergency SMS text message on a mobile phone. This exemplifies one potential weakness of using SMS for emergency communications, namely that messages can be forged. Mobile phones :Mobiles phones may be considered a private communication device, because they are usually associated with or owned by a single individual. One possible limitation of using mobile phones for emergency communications, in a bomb- threat situation, for example, might include the potential of cellular networks being disabled for fear that a bomb might be detonated using a cellular phone. They also provided wide array of apps that can help in emergency communications. Line-based phones :These phones, in whole or in part (e.g. a cordless telephone with base station), are physically connected to and rely upon a wire (often called a landline) to operate. As with mobile phones, these are often associated with a single person, family or business. Regardless, this method may be considered private due to a single phone device‚Äôs inherent weakness in reaching large numbers of people at the same time. SMS/Text messaging :SMS text messages should be considered a type of private communication because they are directed toward a specific mobile phone number; and, thus, they are designed to reach one person at a time without the general public knowing anything about the message. A limitation in using SMS messaging for emergencies might be that it doesn't meet the needs of emergency communication: that is, it must be highly reliable, be secure, have excellent access control, and high-speed delivery. Social Media - Syndicated Emergency Communications * Twitter is an online social networking and micro-blogging service using SMS text messaging. While it wasn't intended or designed for high performance communication, the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on, when the San-Francisco, California-based company used it to communicate during earthquakes. * Facebook may have potential for emergency communication, as it has a large involved user-base. Electronic mail :Email should be considered a type of private communication because it is sent to a specific email address, which is associated with a person. Emails can be sent to multiple people, but even this results in multiple individual copies of the email that are ultimately sent to their individual recipients. Example of an emergency-oriented scrolling instant messenger Emergency-oriented instant messengers and computer screen pop-ups :Personal computer instant messengers have become popular and inexpensive technologies by which to deliver emergency communications to broad or specific audiences in a short period of time. With this technology, emergency communications will \\"pop up\\" on the personal computer screens as a new window that sits on top of any other window that may be open on the screen at the time. This technology uses LAN and/or WAN networks to deliver short messages, often less than about 120 characters in length, typically in real time. The speed of modern LAN and WAN technologies and the shortness of such messages makes it possible to deliver emergency messages to thousands of computer screens in less than a minute's time. :In private communications, a computer pop-up can be targeted to a specific user, i.e. one that is logged into the computer or is associated with that computer in some way. The emergency communication system should be able to define the relationship between the user and his or her computer. A potential limitation of this is that if a user is not logged in, then the operating system may not allow any messages to display. :In the case of public-oriented emergency communications, a computer pop-up ability might prove useful for public computers or interactive kiosks where more than one person might use it, or for computers with displays that are in prominent locations. In this case, the pop-up might also need to be easily read from a distance, and be able to get attention ‚Äî similar to how a digital sign may be used. These might be structured as a notification window with static non- moving text, or as a window with scrolling text. :Emergency communications may require certain attributes that are not commonly found in standard instant messengers; here is a list of attributes that may prove valuable to emergency- oriented instant messengers: * Prevents the user from killing the program, which would prevent the delivery of emergency messages. * Delivers emergency messages in a large font that can be easily read a substantial distance from the screen. Example of an emergency-oriented scrolling instant messenger * Scrolls the message across the screen to attract attention and to ensure that the entire message can be displayed without any user effort. Scrolling the message may also allow for the use of a large font and readability from a distance. * Non-chat-oriented, ensuring that the software will be set up for a large scrolling font. * Supports many priorities for messages, ensuring that emergency messages are not lost in the crowd of common messages that may appear in the computer screen. * Supports a non-counterfeit-able signature as part of the message to insure the recipient that the communication can be trusted and that it comes from a known authority. * Supports both one-to-one and one to many communication. * Emergency-oriented instant messenger requires that the sender of the message have the ability to update messages that are appearing on users PC screens without the recipient needing to take any action. * The sender of an emergency message must have the ability to terminate the display (remove) a message from display on all of the screens that display the message by closing the window in which it is displayed. * Supports communications to arbitrary groups of PC, by lists of PC, by lists of users, and by IP address ranges. Each of these addressability options are optimal in specific circumstances and reduce the labor of administration. :Using instant messaging for emergency communications may also present some limitations: * If the PC is not connected to the network, it will not display the message. This means that the network is another potential point of failure. * If the PC is logged off or if the screen saver is active and requires a password to access the screen, then conventional knowledge posits that it will prevent the delivery of the emergency message. :In addition to some well-known instant messengers, for example ICQ and AIM, a variety of specialized instant messengers exist that are intended for use in emergency communications. The commercially-available products sold by RedAlert and Desktop Alert are examples of specialized instant messengers that claim to provide a relatively narrow set of message delivery capabilities within a smaller subset of an overall ECS. Other commercial offerings MessageNet Connections, React Systems, and Siemens Sygnal also provide instant messengers that are sold to be used in conjunction with other communication equipment such as phones, and digital signage as part of an integrated and whole emergency communication system. Case studies, failures and successes =New York City World Trade Center attack= During the September 11 attack in 2001, traditional telecommunications were stretched and overloaded. Phone networks along the entire East Coast were congested into uselessness. 911 operators were overwhelmed with calls and could do little more than offer encouragement because of the confusing information they were receiving. Communications between emergency services personnel were limited by a lack of interoperability between departments. Many fire-fighters died when the towers collapsed because they couldn't receive the warning that the police officers received from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) helicopters. Amateur radio played a large role in facilitating communications between the various emergency departments, which operated on different frequencies and protocols. Emergency notification on highway approaching London =London Underground bombings= On the day of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, mobile phone networks, including Vodafone, reached full capacity and were overloaded by 10:00 a.m., only an hour and ten minutes after the bombs went off.7/7 London Bombings - History of London on History Because of an antiquated radio system, the damaged trains were unable to communicate with the Transport for London control center or emergency personnel, while senior emergency services managers, of the London Ambulance Service in particular, were forced to rely on the already overloaded mobile phone network because of the lack of digital radios. The Access Overload Control, implemented only in a 1 km area around Aldgate Tube Station, wasn't helpful because many officials didn't have ACCOLC-enabled mobile phones. In the aftermath, the London Assembly determined the need for a digital radio communications system in London that can operate underground. =2011 Joplin, Missouri tornado= 161 people were killed and at least 990 injured when an EF5 multiple-vortex tornado hit Joplin, Missouri. Because Joplin is located in a tornado-prone area of the country, many people considered the tornado sirens routine and ignored them. Instead, many residents waited until they received confirmation from another, non-routine, source, such as seeing the tornado, a radio or TV report, or hearing a second siren. In the aftermath, an assessment team recommended that emergency warnings take risk perception into account to convey a sense of urgency. NOAA Officials are considering ways to change the warning system to distinguish smaller tornadoes from more deadly ones. =Hurricane Katrina= When Hurricane Katrina, a Category 5 hurricane, hit New Orleans, the emergency communications systems were completely destroyed, including power stations, internet servers, mobile phone towers, and 911 services. The Federal relief workers' satellite phones weren't interoperable, even when they did work. A few AM radio stations were able to continue broadcasting throughout the storm, notably WWL Radio, which remained on the air by broadcasting from a closet. Amateur radio was instrumental in the rescue process and maintained signals when 911 communications were damaged or overloaded. =Virginia Tech shootings= The Virginia Tech shooting, which resulted in the death of 33 people, helped propel discourse for effective emergency communication systems in schools. Virginia Tech had systems already in place, including e-mail and text notifications, but lacked a cohesive plan for using them. No warnings were sent out until after the event, two and a half hours after the initial shootings. Virginia Tech has since updated its emergency communications systems, especially public ones, since students can't always check e-mail in a timely fashion and professors often request that wireless devices be turned off in class. Because the massacre occurred within a 10-minute period, other schools have also implemented new, improved emergency communications systems with an emphasis on speed of communication. =2011 T≈çhoku earthquake= The Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) early warning system, which uses seismometers, was able to alert millions of people across Japan about the impending earthquake via radio, mobile phone networks, including Docomo, AU, and SoftBank, and television, including both NHK channels and cable channels. The tsunami warning system alerted people shortly after, although the tsunami was larger than expected. In areas with infrastructure still intact, even though both landline and mobile phone lines were not functioning as might be expected, the Internet was still accessible. In the hardest hit areas, particularly Sendai and other areas of Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima Prefectures, satellite phones were often the only form of communication that functioned reliably. The following nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Plant was rife with communications problems. No communications plan was in place, internal communications were poor, external communications were slow, and the public quickly lost confidence in TEPCO and the nuclear industry. The primary criticism was a failure of the government to release accurate information about the disaster. Calls were made for more transparency and promptness with future events.http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/kan/topics/201106/pdf/chapter_ix.pdf =2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting= During the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, on July 20, 2012, the gunman, James Eagan Holmes, released tear gas before opening fire during a showing of The Dark Knight Rises, causing many of the moviegoers to mistake the attack for part of the film's special effects. According to preliminary reports, the suspect initially went into the theater as a patron. He then exited and propped open an emergency exit, while he went to his car to get his bulletproof vest and weapons. He then attacked after reentry through the propped-open door. In this type of situation, there could have been considerable warning. Technology exists that can warn about open doors (such as an emergency door that shouldn't normally be open), and can send clear warning and instructions to any number of devices, including a movie screen. There is also a significant opportunity to consider the use of the theater's fire alarm system. Shortly after the assailant began shooting, the building's fire alarms were sounded. The natural inclination, in response to a fire alarm, would be to evacuate the building, but in this case, the assailant was specifically targeting people who attempted to exit. =Hurricane Sandy= Hurricane Sandy hit New York City, New Jersey, and the surrounding area on October 29, 2012, destroying thousands of houses and leaving millions without electricity and thus without internet, mobile phones, or landline communications. To prepare for the hurricane, many areas provided additional emergency help lines in case 911 wasn't available, The Federal Emergency Management Agency has strengthened its ability to respond to a disaster since the communications problems during Hurricane Katrina and using Twitter in its rescue efforts, and amateur radio operators were on standby to provide emergency communications. In the aftermath, up to 25% of mobile phone towers, network providers, and television stations were powerless. Communications have been steadily improving, however, although the hardest hit areas are still experiencing serious power outages. =Hurricane Harvey= Hurricane Harvey hit the coast of Texas, causing devastation upon landfall and massive flooding in Houston after meandering through Eastern Texas over the course of four days. While organizations like the Salvation Army and American Red Cross contributed to the disaster relief process, H.E.B., a regional grocery chain, was also able to assist by using its emergency notification system to identify employees who were in need of assistance, and those available to help. H.E.B. was able to accomplish this by using its emergency notification system, AlertMedia, which it has used since 2017. H.E.B. deployed mobile kitchens and giant water coolers to the affected community in the days following the hurricane. = Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting = A gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018. The shooter pulled the fire alarm in order to lure students and staff members out into the hallways, which caused some confusion among students and staff members, because there had been a fire drill earlier that same day, and shortly after the shooting began, a staff member activated a code red lockdown. There was also confusion because of the contradictory instructions coming from the emergency communication system, the fire alarm instructing students to evacuate while the PA system instructed them to lock down and stay where they were. Seventeen students and staff members were killed in the shooting, and a further seventeen were injured. This incident prompted students to found Never Again MSD and demand firearm legislation from lawmakers.

Vitiligo occurs in 1-2% of the population worldwide; a loss of color in the skin creating a variety of patterns on the skin from loss of pigment. Vitiligo is often called a disease instead of a disorder and that can have a significantly negative social and/or psychological impact on patients, in part because of numerous misconceptions still present in large parts of the world. The idea of a World Vitiligo Day was first nursed by Steve Haragadon, the founder of the Vitiligo Friends network, and then developed and finalized by Ogo Maduewesi, a Nigerian vitiligo patient who is the founder and Executive Director of the Vitiligo Support and Awareness Foundation (VITSAF). In her words, ‚ÄúWorld Vitiligo Day is a day to create extensive awareness on vitiligo and a day dedicated to all living with vitiligo globally‚Äù.http://www.facebook.com/notes/ogo- maduewesi/report-vitiligo-purple-fun-day-vitiligo-awareness-day-25th- june-2011/2011494841660 The first World Vitiligo Day (also defined as ‚ÄúVitiligo Awareness Day‚Äù or ‚ÄúVitiligo Purple Fun day‚Äù, from the color chosen as Vitiligo Awareness Colorhttp://www.picbadges.com/support-vitiligo- awareness-day/1863858/) was observed on June 25, 2011. The choice of June 25 as World Vitiligo Day is a memorial to musical artist Michael Jackson, who suffered from vitiligo from the early 1980s until his death, which occurred on June 25, 2009. The main event of the first World Vitiligo Day occurred at Silverbird Galleria's Artrum in Lagos, Nigeria, with the participation of several volunteers with different experiences (dermatologists, motivational speakers, dancers, artists, comedians, patients), united by the common will of spreading knowledge and awareness about vitiligo. Simultaneously, other events took place in other parts of the world, organized by local associations. In 2012, Vitiligo Research Foundation (VRF), a non-profit organization aiming to fund and fast-track medical research, as well as connect investigators, care providers, patients and philanthropists, to accelerate vitiligo research and relieve suffering of patients,http://www.vrfoundation.org registered the Web domain name 25june.org and joined VITSAF and cooperating organizations to increase the efficacy of their efforts in favor of global vitiligo awareness. A goal of the World Vitiligo Day 2012 was to raise 500,000 signatures to address the United Nations in order to: * recognize this disease associated with severe social complications; * recognize the desire to pursue multilateral efforts in therapy development and health-care education; * designate June 25 as the World Vitiligo Day to be observed by the United Nations and Member States every year.

This tendency, termed sociosexuality or sociosexual orientation, is divided into three facets measured by the inventory: behavior (in terms of number of casual and changing sex partners), attitude (towards uncommitted sex) and desire (for people not in a romantic relationship). The most recent revision is from 2008. History Sociosexuality as a concept was introduced by Alfred KinseyKinsey, A., Pomeroy, W., & Martin, C. (1948). Sexual behavior in the human male. Philadelphia: Saunders. Kinsey, A., Pomeroy, W., Martin, C., & Gebhard, E (1953). Sexual behavior in the human female. Philadelphia: Saunders to describe differences in individuals tendency to engage in uncommitted sexual relationships. Minimal research was done until interest in the topic markedly increased when Gangestad and Simpson released their 5-item Sociosexual Orientation Inventory in 1991. However, serious problems were found with the original scale with respect to sociosexuality as a single dimension, its sometimes low internal consistency, skewed score distribution, and one question inapplicable to singles. It was these concerns that led Penke and Asendorpf to create the SOI-R to deal with these issues. There currently exist two variations on the SOI-R currently available in 25 languages, a 9-point response scale for integration with the original Gangestad and Simpson SOI and a 5-point response scale for the majority of subjects. The language versions include Czech, English, Hungarian, or Polish. Findings Significant sex differences have been found between men and women on the scale, with a significantly larger correlation between the attitude and behavior facets of the SOI-R in women compared to men (proposed to be due to lower opportunity for behavior). There were pronounced sex differences in desire, mediocre differences for attitude (with men scoring higher than women) no differences in behavior in heterosexual test-takers. Improving on the previous Gangestad and Simpson Sociosexuality scale, the three factors appeared to make unique contributions and have discriminant validity. Desire made unique contributions to the prediction of past sexual and relationship behaviors, observer-rated attractiveness, self-perceived mate value, and male and female flirting behavior, as well as having links with sex drive and relationship quality. Attitude appears responsible for the effect of sociosexuality on mate preferences, assortative mating, and romantic partner's flirtatiousness outside the relationship.Penke, L. (2011).

Band members were better known for performing as the indie rock band, Never Shout Never. History In 2008, members of the indie rock band Never Shout Never formed a post-hardcore side project called EatMeWhileImHot!. The project originally started as a joke, but soon developed into a serious band. Songs like CoughKidCough, IBeatGirlsAtSports, and IHitASquirrelItChangedMyLife were released on MySpace. As the songs were released the band got more and more popular, and the members began to take it seriously. During this time, the band also changed their name to Mister Owl. The group released their debut extended play, All My Friends, on July 7, 2009 as Mister Owl. The song \\"The Point\\" was released as a single on 200 limited edition CD-Rs on Never Shout Never's tour with the band, Hellogoodbye. To support their new EP, the group started to perform shows as Mister Owl in the winter of 2009. The song, \\"xBURRITOx\\" was released as a digital single on December 11. The band name was changed from Mister Owl to Eatmewhileimhot! when Owl City‚Äôs management thought the name was too similar to theirs. With their new name, the band began to record their debut album. xALBUMx was released on July 26, 2010. 300 limited editions physical editions of the album were released through an online preorder. The album received mostly negative reviews from critics, but still charted 46th on the Billboard Heatseeker Albums chart. The non-album single, \\"Get Up and Die\\" was digitally released on January 4, 2011. After the release of the album, the band went on an unofficial hiatus to work on Never Shout Never's Time Travel. Eatmewhileimhot returned at the end of 2011 with the single, \\"Damn Straight\\". The exclamation point in the band name was dropped. On March 2, 2012 their second album, Mushroom, was released. The album features an extreme metal sound rather than the experimental punk genres the band employed on every other release.. It received mostly negative reviews and did not chart. Four music videos were filmed for the album's songs. They later changed their name to Eat Me Raw and were in the process of writing an album with the working title 'Mucus'. The band likely disbanded as Ingle announced in December 2018 that Never Shout Never would dissolve after a small tour in Mexico and Brasil.https://twitter.com/christoferdrew/status/1078017652298260487https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TeEe8EKhVU&list;=RD8TeEe8EKhVU Band members Former members *Christofer Drew ‚Äì vocals, guitar, percussion, programming (2008‚Äì2019) *Hayden Kaiser ‚Äì guitars, drums, backing vocals (2008‚Äì2018) *Caleb Denison - drums (2010‚Äì2011), guitars (2008‚Äì2010) *Nathan Elison - drums (2008‚Äì2010) *Dustin Dobernig - keyboards, synthesizers (2008‚Äì2009) *Taylor MacFee‚Äì bass, backing vocals (2008‚Äì2017) Discography ;Albums *xALBUMx (2010) *Mushroom (2012) ;EPs *All My Friends (2009) *Untitled (2017) ;Compilations *Take Action, Vol. 9 (2010) References Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:American post-hardcore musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Missouri Category:American musical trios ","title":"Eat Me Raw"},{"id":"35486853","text":"Shamsabad (, also Romanized as ShamsƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Hasanabad Rural District, Fashapuyeh District, Ray County, Tehran Province, Iran.

His music education continued in high school and at Langston University in Oklahoma. He returned to Memphis in 1965 and began session work at Stax Records where he teamed up with trumpet player Wayne Jackson. The two created the signature horn sound at Stax on hit records by Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others. After recording numerous tracks at Stax, he and Jackson incorporated themselves into The Memphis Horns and began freelancing. Love and Jackson recorded at sessions for such artists as Neil Diamond, Elvis Presley and Dusty Springfield. The duo also toured with The Doobie Brothers, Jimmy Buffett, Robert Cray and numerous other performers. In 2002, Love was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease which forced his retirement the following year and his eventual death in 2012 at age 70. Al Bell, co-owner of Stax records, said \\"I love saxophone players, and I have many saxophone players I admire and hold in high esteem. But I have never heard a saxophone player who affects and penetrates me like Andrew Love. It was the spirit in him, and you could feel it in the music.

Siepel (born 1972) is an American computational biologist known for his research in comparative genomics and population genetics, particularly the development of statistical methods and software tools for identifying evolutionarily conserved sequences. Siepel is currently Chair of the Simons Center for Quantitative Biology and Professor in the Watson School for Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.Adam Siepel's CV. Education and career Siepel completed a B.S. in Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Cornell University in 1994, then worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory until 1996. From 1996 to 2001, he worked as a software developer at the National Center for Genome Resources in Santa Fe, while completing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico. He obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2005. He was on the faculty of Cornell University from 2006 to 2014 and moved to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 2014. Research Siepel has worked on various problems at the intersection of computer science, statistics, evolutionary biology, and genomics. At Los Alamos National Laboratory, he developed phylogenetic methods for detecting recombinant strains of HIV, and at the National Center for Genome Resources, he led the development of ISYS, a technology for integrating heterogeneous bioinformatics databases, analysis tools, and visualization programs. Siepel also did theoretical work on algorithms for phylogeny reconstruction based on genome rearrangements, working with Bernard Moret at the University of New Mexico. When Siepel left software development to join David Haussler's laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz, he turned to computational problems in comparative genomics. In Haussler's group, he developed several analysis methods based on phylogenetic hidden Markov models, including a widely used program called phastCons for identifying evolutionarily conserved sequences in genomic sequences. At Cornell, Siepel's research group continued to work on the identification and characterization of conserved non-coding sequences. They also studied fast-evolving sequences in both coding and noncoding regions, including human accelerated regions. In recent years, the Siepel laboratory has increasingly focused on human population genetics, developing methods for estimating the times in early human history when major population groups first diverged, for measuring the influence of natural selection on transcription factor binding sites, and for estimating probabilities that mutations across the human genome will have fitness consequences. The group also has an active research program in transcriptional regulation, carried out in close collaboration with John T. Lis's laboratory. A common theme in Siepel's research is the development of precise mathematical models for the complex processes by which genomes evolve over time. His research group uses these models, together with techniques from computer science and statistics, both to peer into the past, and to address questions of practical importance for human health. Awards and honours Siepel was a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2012.Guggenheim profile. He was also awarded a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering in 2007, a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship in 2007, and a Sloan Research Fellowship in 2009.

Opened in 1997, it is operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), a joint venture between Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre (NSC). SvalSat and KSAT's Troll Satellite Station (TrollSat) in Antarctica are the only ground stations that can see a low altitude polar orbiting satellite (e.g., in sun-synchronous orbit) on every revolution as the earth rotates. As of December 2019 the facility consists of almost 100 multi-mission and customer- dedicated antennas which operate in the C, L, S, X and K bands. The station provides ground services to more satellites than any other facility in the world. Customers with their own installations include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty. History The road up to SvalSat with radomes in the background The European Space Research Organization (ESRO) established Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-√Ölesund as one of its four initial European Space Tracking Network stations.Kriege and Russo (2000): 59 The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974,√òvregard (1996): 330 but was closed as it was not suitable for ESRO's second generation of satellites.Kriege and Russo (2000): 142 During the planning of the station, Longyearbyen had been proposed as a location, and it was largely political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-√Ölesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.R√∏berg and Collett (2004): 14 In the 1990s, NSC operated Troms√∏ Satellite Station (TSS), which was used as a ground station for a limited number of satellites.Wormdal (2011): 37 After Rolf Sk√•r was appointed director of NSC, plans were launched to try to win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Sk√•r invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard,Wormdal (2011): 38 and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen.Wormdal (2011): 39 Svalbard was chosen because of its high latitude from which every polar-orbiting satellite above can be seen on every revolution as the earth rotates within its orbital plane. For the EOS program, Svalbard was supplemented by Poker Flat Research Range in Fairbanks, Alaska. Construction of the road up to Plat√•berget started in 1996 and a relay station was built to send the data to Isfjord Radio before being sent onwards to a geostationary satellite.Wormdal (2011): 40 The first installation was an parabolic antenna with S and X band capability. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. It was followed up by three other EOS satellites: Terra, Aqua and QuikSCAT.Wormdal (2011): 41 To ensure a sustainable financing of operations, NSC started negotiating with other potential customers. However, the project was rejected by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Instead, a cooperation was made with Kongsberg Aerospace and Defence and Lockheed Martin, who built the second antenna as a joint venture.Wormdal (2011): 44 In 2001, a German research group applied for permission to establish a ground station in Ny- √Ölesund. NSC feared that the competition could undermine the financial capabilities of SvalSat. However, no facility in Ny-√Ölesund was built. In 2002, ownership and operations of the facility were consolidated and taken over by the newly created Kongsberg Satellite Services. Lockheed Martin was no longer interested in owning a share of the facility, and sold their shares. NSC and Kongsberg merged their interests in the new company, which also took over TSS. By 2004, six antennas, between in diameter, had been installed. Northrop Grumman and Raytheon decided in 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the successor of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of optical fiber cable connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data as they would have to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004. Starting in 2007, SvalSat was expanded with 12 antennas. Five are used for Galileo, while the remaining are used for a large array of customers. In 2007 and 2008, both Terra and Landsat 7 were hacked twice. The hackers were able to achieve all steps which would have been necessary to take control over the satellites, but did not actually take control. The operation commanded the satellites via SvalSat, which it was able to hack via the Internet connection. In his 2011 book Satellittkrigen, Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation journalist B√•rd Wormdal argues that SvalSat is used for military intelligence and thus is violating the Svalbard Treaty. Specifically, Wormdal provides evidence that downloaded images of the earth are used for intelligence and military activities. For instance, a Landsat image taken during the Libyan Civil War was sold by the Italian company e-GEOS to the Italian Armed Forces. Similarly, a Technology Experiment Satellite image was sold to the United States Armed Forces during the War in Afghanistan and Arirang-2 images of North Korean installations have been sold to the United States. All three satellites use SvalSat as one of their ground stations. According to Governor Odd Olsen Inger√∏, even if a military should indirectly use information downloaded from SvalSat, this would not be a breach of the treaty. A dissertation by Professor Geir Ulfstein concludes that even if a ground station was directly used for downloading military intelligence from military satellites, it would still be permitted by the treaty.Ulfstein (1995): 356 Operation SvalSat with Svalbard Airport, Longyear in the front SvalSat is owned and operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), which is again equally owned by the Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre, the latter which is again owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Of KSAT's 200 employees, 40 are stationed in Longyearbyen and work at SvalSat. KSAT is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and some of the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than 30 minutes after downloading. As of January 2020 SvalSat receives data from 130 different satellites, and with Troms√∏ station receives data from at total of 40 000 passes each months. All ground stations are connected to KSAT's Troms√∏ Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat can be used to communicate with the satellites. Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Troms√∏ Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk. KSAT operates two polar ground stations optimized for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the other being TrollSat at Troll in Antarctica. These are the only two ground stations able to see a polar- orbiting satellite on every revolution. By using both stations, customers can communicate with a satellite twice per orbit. All satellites which use SvalSat need a concession from the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority. Such a concession is only awarded to satellites which would abide by the treaty and explicitly excludes any military satellites. However, this does not prevent information from dual-use satellites being sold to military organizations. The Governor of Svalbard inspects the station twice per year. This includes checking the logs of satellites SvalSat has communicated with, but not the actual information transferred. All SvalSat employees need a security clearance from NATO and the Norwegian Armed Forces.Wormdal (2011): 14 Facilities NOAA employees in front of one of NOAA's antennas SvalSat is located on Plat√•berget, a mountain plateau above mean sea level just outside Longyearbyen on the island of Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway. The location on the 78th parallel north is favorable to communication with satellites in low polar orbits. The facility consists of close to 100 antenna systems (as of des. 2019), both multi-mission and customer dedicated, making SvalSat the world's largest commercial ground station. They are variously capable of communication in the C, L, S, X and K bands. SvalSat makes use of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems' Space Link Extension protocols, an international standard for ground station to satellite communication. Most antennas use the S band for tracking, telemetry and commanding and the X band for high-speed data download. Originally, SvalSat used a combination of a 2 megabits per second (Mb/s) leased line, several Integrated Services Digital Network lines and a 55 Mbit/s satellite Internet access via Intelsat for data transmission off the island. From 2004, the Svalbard Undersea Cable System gives two redundant fiber lines to the mainland, each providing 10 gigabits per second. The fiber connection is operated by Telenor. Power is supplied from Longyearbyen Power Station, In case of a power outage, the facility is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply and has a standby generator capable of supplying power for two weeks. The facility consists of a main operations building, a building for the emergency power supply, a transformer station, and a mobile research station, in addition to the radomes. The lot is located above Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani's Mine 3 and is leased to KSAT. The facility is connected to Longyearbyen via a long private road. When the road is closed because of avalanches and land slides, helicopter transport is used. There is a road connecting all the antennas to ease maintenance. Installations at SvalSat not related to satellite communication include a measuring station for radioactive particles in the air operated by Norwegian Seismic Array, a telecommunications installation operated by Telenor, a weather station operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, with information relayed to Svalbard Airport, Longyear, and a weather station operated by SvalSat. Antennas are placed according to customer specifications, which normally involves a distance of between antennas. This is to ensure that antennas do not shade each other and that their electromagnetic noise and radio noise do not interfere with each other. Locations are chosen to maximize satellite pass durations, view a calibration station on Hiorthhamnfjellet, provide visibility of the Clarke Belt for geostationary satellite antennas, or visibility to Isfjord Radio for terrestrial communications antennas. Customers SvalSat is part of NASA's Near Earth Network. This includes support for the Earth Observing System, which includes satellites such as Aqua, Aura, Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, and QuikSCAT, as well as the Small Explorer program which includes Galaxy Evolution Explorer, the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite, Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and Transition Region and Coronal Explorer. SvalSat and Poker Flat are collectively responsible for half of the network's 140 daily passes. Satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using SvalSat includes the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Other American satellites include the United States Geological Survey's Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 and the private Iridium Communications' satellites.Wormdal (2011): 13 The European Space Agency operates several antennas, which are able to transmit in the S band and receive in the S and X band. ESA uses the facility for tracking, telemetry, telecommand, radiometric measurements and system validation. Satellites include European Remote-Sensing Satellite 2, Sentinel 1, 2, 3 and 5P and Envisat. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites uses SvalSat as a ground station for its MetOp satellites, which allows communication with all MetOp orbits. SvalSat serves as one of five uplink stations and as a sensor station for Galileo. Five antennas are used for Galileo, including one with a diameter and four at . The Norwegian Coastal Administration uses SvalSat to track ships' Automatic Identification System in Norwegian waters via AISSat-1. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency uses SvalSat for its Hinode mission.Sakurai (2008): 22 Other customers include MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates's Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2, the Taiwanese National Space Organization's Formosat-2, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute of South Korea's Arirang-2, the Indian Space Research Organisation's Technology Experiment Satellite, Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2, the German RapidEye constellation, the Italian Space Agency's COSMO-SkyMed and the German Aerospace Center's TerraSAR-X.

Features  The durability and life of dynamically loaded, welded steel structures is determined in many cases by the welds, particular the weld transitions. Through selective treatment of the transitions (grinding (abrasive cutting), abrasive blasting, hammering, etc.), the durability of many designs increase significantly. Hammering methods have proven to be particularly effective treatment methods and were within the joint project REFRESHWebsite of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) ‚Äì Project REFRESH extensively studied and developed. The HiFIT process (High Frequency Impact Treatment) is such a hammering method that is universally applicable, requires only a low tech equipment and still offers high reproducibility and the possibility for quality control.  Operation  HiFIT hammer The HiFIT hammer operates with a hardened pin with a ball resting on the workpiece with a diameter D of 3 mm. Th Nitschke-Pagel, Klaus Dilger, H.Eslami, I.Weich, T.Ummenhofer. \\"Residual stresses and near surface material condition of welded high strength steels after different mechanical post-weld treatments\\" . 2008\\\\. This pin is hammered with an adjustable intensity at around 180‚Äì300 Hz at the weld toe. Local mechanical deformations occur in the form of a treatment track. The weld toe is deformed plastically. The induced compressive residual stress prevents the track cracking and the crack propagation on the surface.  Evidence  The International Institute of Welding Technology IIW published the Guideline \\"Recommendations for the HFMI Treatment\\" in October 2016. An overview of higher frequency hammers (HFMI) is presented, and recommendations for the correct application of the method and quantitative measurements for quality assurance the guideline provides the basis for measurements of HFMI improved welded joints on the basis of all known stress calculation concepts. In numerous experiments at various institutes and universities an 80 to 100 percent increase of fatigue strength and a 5 ‚Äì to 15-fold increase in weld-life could be demonstrated. The most extensive research project was from 2006 to 2009 \\"REFRESH ‚Äì life extension of existing and new welded steel structures (P702). In this research project, the HiFIT device was developed and made ready for production. This report is available in book form at the FOSTA (Forschungsvereinigung Stahlanwendung e.V.) and can be ordered under the number . The book contains detailed scientific verifications and validations.  Steps in the HiFIT method  The HiFIT method can be applied to both existing as well as new steel structures. = Preliminary steps = For a targeted treatment, the visibility and accessibility of the transition in the welded areas are required. Existing structures typically are prepared at the transition for surface finishing. The parts must be free of loose rust and old paint. If necessary, previous sandblasting is required. The device operates with a compressed air supply of 6‚Äì8 bar. = Steps = HiFIT device is manually placed on the treated weld transition and during treatment, along this run. = Result = By local transformations, the weld toe plastically deformed and solidified. The depth of the aftertreatment track should be between 0.2 and 0.35 mm. The undercut at the weld toe is no longer recognizable. = Process safety = By visual inspection, the treated region are examined. The treatment depth can be checked with a special gauge. A digital display of the operating pressure allows the user to control the whole time.  Economic importance of HiFIT  = Lifetime extension = When applied to existing constructions, the lifetime can be extended considerably. If no macroscopically visible cracks are present, HiFIT is a very suitable remediation tool. With timely remediation of existing structures there is practically no difference to the life of new treated welds. This gives the potential to use existing constructions far beyond the planned lifetime. The HiFIT-method is used very efficient e.g. at highway bridges in steel hollow box-section design on the fly. Costs for reconstruction are low compared to conventional methods. In the commercial vehicle industry and other industries highly stressed welds on existing and new structures are treated with HiFIT to extend lifetime successfully. = Increasing the transferable load level = In case of new constructions and for some existing structures the load level for treated welds can be increased. Using constructions for the same lifetime as before welds can transfer 1.6 times loads. This has e.g. for cranes the very positive effect of larger lifting capacity. The efficiency of cranes increases with each stroke. = Lightweight= Taking into account the HiFIT process during development, on same load level and same lifetime, the construction can be slimmed down specifically. Extensive experimental investigations on structural details and FEM-supported-design methods has shown the high efficiency with conventional S235, S355J2 and fine grain steels, such as S460N, S690QL and even higher strength steels. The achievable material saving makes the HiFIT application in most applications already economically viable. Considering the additional benefit of the weight advantage e.g. the achievable payload in vehicles can be increased.

Between October 1940 and April 1941 the airfield was used by Fiat G.50s of the Corpo Aereo Italiano, an expeditionary force from the Regia Aeronautica (\\"Royal Air Force\\") that participated in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz during the final months of 1940 during World War II. From 1941 onwards Luftwaffe squadrons (III./JG 53 and II./JG 26) began operating from the airfield. It was seized by British Forces in September 1944, and Royal Engineers repaired the field, designating it \\"Advanced Landing Ground B-65\\". It became home to the 135 Wing. It was abandoned after the war, the facility being redeveloped into an industrial area. References * Flugplatz Maldegem * Johnson, David C.

Description The Gulf flounder is a flatfish that swims on its side. Their two eyes look upward when swimming. They have sharp teeth, two eyes on one side, and have a white side. Paralichthys albigutta is widely distributed in the western North Atlantic. Adults are found in a variety of habitats, but generally prefer hard, sandy bottoms; juveniles settle in high salinity seagrass beds. Longevity is 7‚Äì10 years and females reach maturity between 1‚Äì2 years. It is commercially and recreationally exploited. The center of abundance of Paralichthys albigutta in the Gulf of Mexico is along the northeastern coast of Florida.Topp, R.W., Hoff, F.H. Jr., 1972. Flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) . Memoirs of the Hourglass Cruises, pp. 135. Florida Department of Natural Resources, St. Petersburg. West of the Mississippi River delta, it occurs in very low numbers.Matlock, G.C., 1982. By-catch of Southern Flounder and Gulf Flounder by commercial shrimp trawlers in Texas Bays. Management Data Series No. 31. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. It appears to naturally occur in low abundance in seagrass beds.Crawford, C.R, Steele, P., McMillen-Jackson, A.L. and Bert, T.M. 2011. Effectiveness of bycatch-reduction devices in roller-frame trawls used in the Florida shrimp fishery. Fisheries Research 108: 248‚Äì257. It is common in museum collections (660 lots). Many species of fishes, including P. albigutta, have experienced declines in abundance in the Northern Gulf of Mexico from 1970-2000; although Fodrie et al. (2010),Fodrie, J.F., Heck, K.L., Powers, S.P, Graham, W.M., Robinson, K.L. 2010. Climate-related, decadal-scale assemblage changes of seagrass-associated fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Global Change Biology 16(1): 48‚Äì59.(This needs to be challenged, as in coastal Western Louisiana, the flounder have not been as plentiful in 50 years, as of 2018), attributed this at least in part to the effects of global rises in sea temperature, there are also a number of other factors (e.g., bycatch in trawl fisheries, increased recreational landings: T. Munroe pers. comm. 2015) that may contribute to these declines. Gill netting has been implicated in the decline of flounder stocks in North Carolina due to targeting of non- reproductive juveniles; however, the population-level effects of this method of harvest on P. albigutta are unknown  Habitat  This demersal species occurs in shallow depths within estuaries and coastal environments; it is most commonly found on the continental shelf at depths of 18‚Äì92 m, but has been collected to about 130 m. It is found in a variety of habitats, including seagrass beds,Gloeckner, D.R., Luczkovich, J.J. 2009.

Influence of hard bottom morphology on fish assemblages of the continental shelf off Georgia, southeastern USA . Bulletin of Marine Science 84(3): 265-286. It prefers hard, sandy bottoms. Juveniles utilize vegetation for habitat or are found adjacent to vegetation in estuaries.Murphy, M.D., Muller, R.G., McLaughlin, B. 1994. A stock assessment of Southern Flounder and Gulf Flounder. Florida Marine Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Florida. Juveniles inhabit high salinity seagrass beds and older adults occur offshore in deeper depths. It undergoes ontogenetic shifts in dietary preference, feeding on amphipods and small crustaceans at small sizes, and feeding primarily on fishes as adults. Adults spend most of the year in bays and estuaries, migrating into deeper offshore waters to spawn during fall and winter (peaking between late October-mid-December). Specimens with ripe gonads have been collected at depths of 20‚Äì40 m in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Larvae migrate inshore during January‚ÄìFebruary. The age at maturity for females is 1 year (FWRI 2010) with all mature by 2 years and size at 50% maturity is 35‚Äì38 cm TL. Males reach maturity between 30‚Äì35 cm TL. Females grow faster and larger than males. Longevity for males is 8‚Äì11 years and females is 7 years (Munroe 2002).  Fishing  They are a common sport fish that can be readily caught with dead fish (such as mullet), live bait, or even artificial or frozen baits such as shrimp or clams. A common way of catching this flounder is by spearfishing or jigging. The recreational daily bag limit for this species is 10 and the minimum size is 12 inches (established in 1996). Commercial fishermen are permitted to take up to 50 lbs of flounder species as by-catch per trip. The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission is currently conducting stock assessments for gulf and southern flounder populations in the Gulf of Mexico, which will inform the development of a fishery management plan. This species is commercially and recreationally exploited as a foodfish. It is caught using trawl, gill net, gig, hook-and- line, and trammel net. As with P. lethostigma, this species is harvested using gill nets in estuaries.Thorpe, T., Beresoff, D. and Cannady, K. 2001. Gillnet bycatch potential, discard mortality, and condition of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in southeastern North Carolina. Final Report: North Carolina Marine Fisheries Commission.

This demersal species occurs in shallow depths within estuaries and coastal environments; it is most commonly found on the continental shelf at depths of 18‚Äì92 m, but has been collected to about 130 m.  Threats  This is a commercially and recreationally important species, particularly in Florida. It is also taken as by-catch in commercial trawl fisheries, particularly the penaeid shrimp fishery. Seagrass beds have experienced historical declines off Florida, especially in Florida Bay.Robblee, M. B., T. R. Barber, P. R. Carlson, M. J. Durako, J. W. Fourqurean, L. K. Muehlstein, D. Porter, L. A. Yarbro, R. T. Zieman, and J. C. Zieman. 1991. Mass Mortality of the Tropical Seagrass Thalassia-Testudinum in Florida Bay (USA). Marine Ecology Progress Series 71(3): 297-99. The large seagrass die-off in Florida Bay between 1987-1995 was likely caused by salinity stress, turbidity, and algal blooms.Zieman, J. C., Fourqurean, J. W., & Frankovich, T. A. 1999.

Over that decade, the standing crop of Thalassia testudinum declined by 28%, Halodule wrightii by 92%, and Syringodium filiforme by 88%. Since then, the decline has slowed, but die-off continues to occur. Between 1995-2003, turtle and shoal grass abundance increased with improved water clarity and has remained generally stable.Hall, M.O, Madley, K., Durako, M.J., Zieman, J.C., and Robblee, M.B. 2007.

Biography and career Photo portrait of Taha Hussein circa 1955 Born in November 1921 in Turkey, Van Leo grew up during an era of Armenian genocide and persecution and had to flee with his family at the age of 4 to take refuge in Egypt. It was only due to his father's privileged social position as a worker for a German-owned Baghdad railway Company that Levon and his family escaped the genocide in the Ottoman Empire.Corgnati, Martina. \\"Van Leo: An Armenian Photographer in Cairo\\". Excerpt from A Photographer called Van Leo. 2007. Web. In Egypt, Levon attended the English Mission School followed by the English Mission College. It was at the English Mission College, around the age of 16 or 17, after having bought Hollywood postcards of famous film star that Levon discovered his interest in photography. Fascinated by Hollywood and the world of cinema, Levon decided to put his studies on hold, after having been enrolled in the American University in Cairo in 1940 to pursue his passion. Levon undertook an apprenticeship at Studio Venus owned by a famous Armenian photographer named Artinian before opening his own studio with his brother Angelo in January, 1941, in the living room of their apartment.Iverson, Barry. \\"The Life of Cairo Master Photographer Van Leo.\\" Van Leo: A Rare Look. Cairo: The American University in Cairo, 2012. Print. Most of the brothers' clientele were transitory WWII soldiers and officers, and entertainers and high society of the Opera who were often brought via the Entertainment National Service Association to entertain the soldiers and officers of the British troops. In 1947, the partnership ended between the 2 brothers and Levon established his own studio, for which and from which he later go the name Van Leo. Although throughout the 6 years of partnership between the 2 brothers all the prints bore Angelo's name, it was generally agreed that Van Leo was the more talented but the differences between the 2 in the early years of the partnership still remain blurred.Zada, John. \\"The Iconic Portraiture of Van Leo\\" Canvas Magazine. During the early years of his studio, Van Leo would often take portraits of people, some of which were celebrities, for free, for the sake of advertisement of his new studio. Actors, actresses, entertainers from the Opera were his favorite clientele for they were in constant need of new pictures for their productions. One condition maintained for Van Leo's free work was that a visible credit would be shown under each photograph and as such his name became associated with the celebrities. Although he was associated with the celebrities, Van Leo was admired for being a photographer who did not seek money, or publicity. He had refused to attain a name from being a photographer of the powerful, like several photographers at the time who had publicized themselves as being photographers of kings or presidents. After the Egyptian coup d'√©tat of 1952, Van Leo's clients mainly became individuals from the higher strata of the Egyptian society, foreign residents in Egypt, and actors and actresses maintained their dealings with the artist (Rushdi Abaza, Dalida, Taha Hussien, Omar El Sherif). Out of necessity, he also had to start doing passport and ID work, wedding portraits, portraits for soldiers and officers of the Egyptian Armed Forces, and even reproductions of photos the deceased brought by their loved ones. On January 24, 1998 Van Leo did his last portrait session and later proceeded to close his studio. The same year, Van Leo bequeathed his entire collection of work to the American University of Cairo. In March 2002, Van Leo died from a heart attack. Work Van Leo was characterized by a glamorous style inspired by Hollywood; his lights were always theatrical and his images always refined with his printing techniques. Printing methods were central for Van Leo's work. Increasingly he would use 35mm film for subjects of little interest for him. He would reserve the largest sheet films (18x24 cm) for his favored subjects. One important subject was himself. Van Leo invested in his own self-portraits which he called \\"auto-portraits\\" and has created for himself a collection of 400 auto- portraits in various costumes and characters including Jesus, a beggar, a WWII pilot, a cowboy, a robber, a woman hater, several varieties of women, a gunman, a Saudi Sheikh, and many others. Besides portraits, Leon also invested in photographing antiquities like the Pyramids of Giza, famous mosques in Cairo, ruins in Luxor, and touristic sites in Paris, Rome, and Vienna. Van Leo was also known for his attention to details. Not only did he control the set, the surroundings, and the lighting, but he also mastered the angles of his shots, the poses, the expressions, and was known for being self-sufficient and independent in his work, and in that way was compared to a painter. This is portrayed in Van Leo's mastery to create a portrait of an Egyptian athlete posing as Rodin's \\"thinker\\". A subject giving him no restrictions over a portrait, and complete freedom as to how arrange the details was the ultimate compliment to Van Leo. It has been argued that the strength of Van Leo's portraits comes from his understanding of the character of his sitters. When he asked what attracted him to portraits in specific, he answered that it has been a person's face that appealed to and interested him the most.Bassiouni, Fatma. \\"Van Leo's Unrivaled Images of Cairo's Belle Epoch.\\" The Middle East Times. 2000. Web Van Leo was known for his black and white portraits and the end of the black and white era and the emergence of color caused a significant shift in Van Leo's life and career. To Van Leo, artistic photography ended in Egypt with the changeover. Despite many photographers embracing the change, Leo's bias towards black and white clearly led to a noticeable decline in the output and quality of his work. Not only did his bias stand in his way, but the loss of control associated with the emergence of color, and his lack of strobes led to the ultimate decline in his work. Because of the changeover, Van Leo had to trade his familiar hand-produced prints from his darkroom to an operator in a commercial color lab. Secondly, he did not own or invest in modern strobes to improve output or lighting of his work, but rather clung to his old tungsten light equipment. Legacy and recognition It has been argued that Van Leo's collection is a documentation of Egyptian society over the last fifty years and has been called an artist for turning his photography into art. Various articles written by friends and colleagues of Van Leo have been written about his life and work with each paying homage to his art and the manner in which the artist had insisted on preserving that art. After being nominated for the Prince Claus Award by the Arab Image Foundation in Beirut, an organization dedicated to preservation of old photographs of the Middle East, Van Leo won the award in 2000, and thereafter received heightened global attention and recognition. In 2001, Akram Zaatari, a Lebanese artist directed Her + Him Van Leo a documentary featuring Van Leo himself. Zaatari decided to use interview footage with Leo to produce a \\"kind of dialogue with Van-Leo as opposed to a film about him.\\" Zaatari depicts an encounter between Van Leo and an anonymous researcher whose grandmother's picture was taken by Leo in 1959. The documentary discusses the life, work, and art of Van Leo. Van Leo is the subject of a forthcoming book edited by Negar Azimi and Karl Bassil of the Arab Image Foundation. Awards Van Leo was honoured with a Prince Claus Award in 2000. He was the first photographer ever to win the prestigious prize.

Roth for the Syfy channel. It tells the story of the thunder god Thor, after he defeated the Midgard Serpent and died, then was reincarnated into a mortal man. Thor, along with his two brothers and friends travel to a mysterious island at Midgard's edge, seeking glory and fame. Upon arriving they encounter strange creatures and they start searching the island for answers. Meanwhile, Thor keeps seeing visions of a mighty warrior and a big hammer and Freyja tells him that his visions are clues. So they start searching for the hammer. Plot In the opening, a narrator tells us, \\"...It was unmistakable. A wolf rising its stem and stern. Its sailed dripped blood red. These things served but one purpose, to strike fear and terror into the hearts of any who came across them...\\" A group of Vikings aboard a ship are headed for the ends of the Earth, which turns out to be a mysterious island. The narrator continues \\"...Each stroke, each painful breath, they believed it brought them ever closer to the ends of the Earth. But onward they pushed, for the ends of the Earth they sought. Glory, Honor. These things awaited them there. But so did something else...\\" Freyja (Melissa Osborne), says it is \\"Lingfei\\" (a lost land of legend and fable). Thor (Zachery Ty Bryan) believes it to be a place to build a new kingdom for themselves. Then he corrects himself, saying that it would be the kingdom of his brother, Baldur (Mac Brandt). But Baldur suggests giving it to their elder brother, Ulfrich (Daz Crawford), joking about the island's weather suiting his temper. Upon arrival, Thor has a feeling of deja vu. Sif (Alexis Peters) asks if he is alright. He replies that it was a strange feeling, as if he had been there before. Freyja suggests that he has memories of his past life. Thor replies that if he lived before, then he had died as well. He says he would not make that mistake twice. Thor and Aegir (Velislav Pavlov) go out scouting, but soon a werewolf grabs Aegir and carries him off. Thor makes it back after escaping two other werewolves by climbing up a tree. The Vikings rally and go looking for Aegir. Instead, they find a village. Inside are starving people who have been walled into a house for months, surviving by eating grubs from the dirt. They explain that they arrived in the same manner as the Vikings but were attacked and trapped by the werewolves. Baldur decides to leave some men to guard the village as they continue looking for Aegir. Thor has a vision of a great warrior with a mighty hammer, fighting a giant sea serpent. Freyja informs him that he saw the Hammer of the Gods. Back at the village, the guards are attacked and killed by werewolves. As the group cross a wooden bridge, Freyja sees a vision of Baldur sacrificing his life. The group hears screaming, and Baldur orders everyone back to the village. They arrive to find their men were gone. Baldur decides to return to the ship to fetch the rest of the crew. Thor has another vision: this time, the warrior holds the hammer to the heavens, and lightning strikes the hammer, filling it with power. Seeing this, Thor feels the lightning himself. Freyja tells him his visions are clues to finding the hammer and that it is at the top of the mountain on the island. When they reach the shore, their guards are gone, and the ship has disappeared, so the Vikings are trapped. They return to the village for the night, but the villagers there are also missing. The Vikings set up fort and wait for night. The werewolves arrive and they do battle. The Vikings do well, killing several werewolves to only one Viking loss. Thor cuts off a werewolf's head. The werewolves retreat and carry off their dead, except for the head, which Thor sticks on a pick. The werewolf head soon reverts to a human head, and the Vikings realise what their enemies are. Freyja finds an urn inside the house, she sees something in it that scares her. She goes to show Baldur, but Thor shows her the head in human form. Freyja gasps, dropping the urn into pieces. She asks in fear, \\"What in Odin's name?\\" Then Thor says he was hoping for some insights into that. Inside a house, Thor, Baldur, Ulfrich, Freyja, and Sif discuss about the head. Ulfrich refuses to believe it's sorcery. But Baldur says it is. Thor recognizes the head, it was one of the villagers. Meaning the werewolves walked amongst the villagers. Sif agrees with him, even though she is disgusted at the sight of the cut-off head. Baldur orders Hermoid (Vladimir Kolev) to take the head out of the room. Freyja tells Thor that it is much worse than he could imagine. Baldur realizes she meant the urn. He asks her why it was so special. She says it had an inscription on the inside. Ulfrich asks what it said. Freyja tells everyone the inscription said, \\"Beware the Sons of Loki.\\" Thor asks her, \\"The god?\\" Baldur says, \\"The trickster!\\" Freyja replies, \\"The same.\\" Sif asks her what it means. She says that Loki had two sons, \\"J√∂rmungandr the Midgard Serpent\\", and \\"Fenris the Wolf\\". Inside a cave, a werewolf reverts to human form, a woman, revealed to be Hel (Nicole Ennemoser), the woman from the village. She reports to Fenris, who orders her to bring Thor and kill everyone else. She interrogates two prisoners, using a werewolf named Skull to torture them. Back at the village, Ulfrich is angered over an imagined affair between Thor and Sif. Ulfrich challenges Thor to a duel. Baldur stops it, but Ulfrich leaves. Later, Hel confronts Ulfrich and invites him to join the werewolves, and kisses him. The Vikings head to the mountain to search for the hammer, but are met by Ulfrich and two werewolves. Words are exchanged, and Ulfrich fights Baldur as the rest are told to run. Ulfrich slashes Baldur in the back, but Baldur then runs, reaching the bridge they had seen before. As the werewolves follow him onto the bridge, Baldur stops in the middle and severs the ropes of the bridge. The bridge falls and Baldur and the werewolves fall into the ravine. Thor and Ulfrich exchange threatening gestures. Ulfrich sneers and then heads away, back to the werewolf base. That night, an old man falls out of a tree. The Vikings run to find the man, Vali (George Zlatarev), who tells them a similar story to the one the villagers had told. A suspicious Thor cuts off one of Vali's fingers. It does not grow back, so he concludes that Vali is not a werewolf. They ask him how he survived for so long, and he tells them that he hasn't left the protection of the tree (from which he just fell) for months. Thor orders the Vikings move on. Vali asks if they're leaving, but Thor says, \\"Not until we kill everything on this entire island!\\" Realising their real intention, Vali says they plan to retrieve \\"Mj√∂lnir\\" (the name of the hammer of the gods). Thor asks how Vali knows of it, and Vali tells them the story of the Hammer of the Gods. The hammer fell from the heavens, a mighty gift from Odin himself. Its power was so great, that only one mortal man could wield it. Thor believed it to be Baldur, but Vali told them the champion's name had been lost through the ages. He says that the champion already wielded it once, and that it was written he will return and wield it again. Thor believes that Baldur would return. Vali asks to finish. He tells them that Loki had two sons. Sif says they already know about J√∂rmungandr and Fenris. But Vali asks her if they knew J√∂rmungandr was felled on that very island by the great champion. He struck down upon him with the hammer. But not before the great serpent had bit him; so he was victorious, but at a terrible cost; his life. Vali then said that Odin was pleased though, so it was prophesied this champion would one day return, and reclaim his place amongst the gods. Thor then collapses in pain from another vision, seeing that he is the one chosen to wield the hammer, Mj√∂lnir. Thereupon, Thor plans to get the hammer, kill Fenris, and find their ship to leave. Arriving at the werewolf base, they see their ship near the hideout. Thor sends Hermoid and Heimdall (Raicho Vasilev) to secure it for departure, while the rest sneak in the back door. Ulfrich is waiting for them, and he and Thor fight as Sif, Freyja and Vali sneak inside. Ulfrich boasts about the power he now has. Thor thrusts his sword through Ulfrich's chest, but Ulfrich simply laughs, and begins to morph into a werewolf. Ulfrich throws Thor's sword up into a tree. Thor jumps, grabs his sword, and slices Ulfrich in two in one movement. Inside, Sif, Freyja, and Vali kill the captured and mortally wounded Viking, Aegir, to free him from his own pain, and are then confronted by Hel. She says Vali is also after the Hammer, but he disappears. Sif and Freyja do battle with Hel. Thor arrives, but is told to go after the hammer, which he does. Thor finds Fenris, who tells him he had waited a long time for Thor's return. He calls Thor, \\"Son of Odin\\", implying Odin is Thor's father. Thor asks Fenris why he keeps the hammer close. Fenris replies that it is because Thor's lust for the hammer draws him to it. Thor says he'll need it back now, and Fenris tauntingly tells him to try to take it. They fight. Meanwhile, Hel kills Freyja; then Sif kills Hel. Sif promises the dead Freyja they will meet again, on the plains of Asgard. Sif goes to aid Thor; she distracts Fenris, allowing Thor time to grab the Mj√∂lnir, with which he hammers Fenris's head. With Fenris dead, Thor and Sif briefly embrace and leave. They exit and find werewolves waiting for them. Thor confronts them, and slams Mj√∂lnir onto the ground: a thunderous shockwave kills all the werewolves. Thor and Sif embrace again. Vali appears, and asks if he could hold the hammer. Thor asks him how he would guarantee Vali wouldn't use it against him. Vali stated that only Thor could wield it. Thor says, \\"I'll think about it,\\" and they all laugh. They go down to the ship. Hermoid and Heimdall are alive; Thor shows them Mj√∂lnir, and they yell with joy. As Thor, Sif, Vali, Hermoid and Heimdall sail back home, the narrator tells us, \\"So, they sailed away from Midgard's edge, each lost in their own silent contemplation. Though they'd won the day, they left more on that Isle than they'd taken.\\" Cast *Zachery Ty Bryan as Thor *Alexis Peters as Sif *Mac Brandt as Baldur *Daz Crawford as Ulfrich *Melissa Osborne as Freyja *Vladimir Kolev as Hermoid *Raicho Vasilev as Heimdall *Nicole Ennemoser as Hel *George Zlatarev as Vali / The Narrator *Hristo Mitzkov as Garmur *John Laskowski as Hodur *Maxim Genchev as Bragi *Richie Manteliev as Vidar *Lazar Radkov as Borr *Velislav Pavlov as Aegir *Peter Meltev as Freyr *Rafael Jordan as Campfire Viking External links * Category:2009 television films Category:American films Category:Syfy original films Category:Films about Thor Category:Films set in the Viking Age Category:Films scored by Lucas Vidal ","title":"Hammer of the Gods (2009 film)"},{"id":"35487525","text":"Entering the London congestion charge At Old Street with road markings, showing inset Sign. Road pricing in the United Kingdom used to be limited to conventional tolls in some bridges, tunnels and also for some major roads during the period of the Turnpike trusts. The term road pricing itself only came into common use however with publication of the Smeed Report in 1964 which considered how to implement congestion charging in urban areas as a transport demand management method to reduce traffic congestion. Road pricing schemes in place in the UK as of 2012 include road congestion pricing in London and Durham; the London low emission zone which is a pollution charge scheme only affecting trucks with less efficient engines entering London; and the M6 toll, the only existing toll road on a strategic road in the UK. The Dartford crossings toll was retained as a demand management tool in 2003. The various local and any national road pricing schemes were promoted by the 1997-2010 Labour government which were then abandoned following strong public opposition. A heavy goods vehicle (HGV) road user charging scheme had been proposed by the 2010-2015 coalition government together with a suggested new ownership and financing model to fund new road construction. History In the 1960s the Smeed Report considered how to implement congestion charging. In October 2002, the Durham congestion charge, England's first congestion charging scheme was introduced. It was restricted to a single road in that city, with a ¬£2 charge. In 2003 the London congestion charge was introduced. In November 2003, Secretary of State for Transport Alistair Darling said that despite apparent initial interest from many city councils, including those of Leeds, Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol, no city apart from Edinburgh had yet approached the Government for assistance in introducing a charge. The Western Extension of the London congestion charge was introduced in 2007 (and withdrawn on 1 January 2011). In July 2008, the Drivers' Alliance was established, an organisation which has subsequently campaigned against the introduction of a number of schemes. Design considerations =Finance models= There are no multiple zones in operation in the UK; when it was decided to extend congestion charging from central London to include the West End of London, there was some discussion about having two zones running side- by-side. However, the Western zone was introduced by simply extending the area of the earlier London zone and use the same charges and conditions for simplicity. Edinburgh seriously considered a two-cordon road pricing scheme but rejected it in 2005 after a public referendum. Tolls and Shadow tolls. = Metering and billing = The Durham scheme uses an automated toll booth, while London uses a remote system based on CCTV and automatic number plate recognition. The costs of tracking and billing are very large; for the remote monitoring of the London scheme the majority of the income raised is absorbed by the costs. There are suggestions that a wireless \\"tag and beacon\\" scheme could be introduced as a potentially better and cheaper alternative. =Privacy= Although the more recent Data Protection Act now gives a framework for the responsible collection of personal data in the UK, the privacy concerns identified in the Smeed report were not addressed by the London scheme, with fears expressed over mass surveillance and abuse of the systems. Current schemes ;Road pricing * Durham congestion charge (2002) * London congestion charge, (2003) * London low emission zone introduced between 2008 and 2012 for commercial vehicles with older or less clean engines. * Dartford Crossing, which was converted from a traditional toll to a congestion charge in 2003. There are also the following traditional toll roads in Great Britain in operation: M6 Toll, Clifton Suspension Bridge, Humber Bridge, Mersey Tunnels, Severn Bridge, Tyne Tunnel and a few others on more minor roads. Proposed schemes =HGV road user charging (2012)= In 2012 the government announced that it was consulting on introducing heavy goods vehicle (HGV) road user charging scheme, known as the 'HGV Road User Levy' in order to ensure that foreign hauliers make a contribution towards the upkeep of British roads. The HGV Road User Levy Bill, legislation to introduce a time based charging scheme was brought into Parliament in October 2012, and subsequently passed, receiving Royal Assent in February 2013. The levy scheme will charge all HGVs weighing 12,000kg or more is due to be introduced from April 2014.b Under the scheme, the largest heaviest vehicles will pay up to ¬£10 per day, or ¬£1,000 per year to use roads in the UK. Parliamentary proceedings relating to the HGV Road User Levy Act 2013 =New ownership and financing models (2012)= In a speech in April 2012 the Prime Minister, David Cameron spoke of the urgent need to fund more road construction, proposing road tolling for new roads as one answer. He also mentioned the possibility of shadow tolls and new ownership and financing models. Shadow tolls are fees paid to a road maintenance company per driver using a road, but the fees are paid by the government rather than drivers. =Nationwide road pricing (2012)= A 2012 study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) funded by the RAC Foundation found that the government's drive to promote green vehicles with a lower carbon footprint could result in a significant loss of revenue from motoring taxes, estimated at billion by 2029 at current prices, according to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility. This revenue decline is partly due to improved vehicle efficiency and the growth of plug-in electric vehicles. Among the options available to the government to offset the loss, a further increase of the duty on gasoline and diesel or the introduction of new taxes on alternative energy sources such as electricity for vehicles were considered. However, due to lack of popularity of the former and the risks of hindering the entire green vehicle strategy, the IFS study recommended to introduce a nationwide system of road pricing to charge drivers by each mile driven, with higher pricing in congested areas at peak times, while reducing the existing motoring taxes. Under this strategy drivers in the countryside would be likely to pay less, as rural motorists are currently overtaxed according to the study. Earlier proposals =HGV Road user charging (2000-2005)= The Labour administration first proposed HGV road user charging in 2000 with encouragement for the Conservative opposition. A Treasury progress report was published in 2002 followed by a second report in 2003. In 2005 the government announced that it was halting the development of the scheme and would be progressing with the development of a National road pricing scheme covering all vehicles, a scheme which was itself abandoned in 2009. Primary legislation, titled 'The Heavy Goods Vehicles (Charging for the Use of Certain Infrastructure on the Trans-European Road Network was however enacted in 2009' in response to an EU Directive. =Local schemes 2005‚Äì2008= ;Edinburgh 2005 Edinburgh City Council proposed a congestion zone, but this was rejected in a postal referendum by around 75% of voters in Edinburgh. Unlike in London, where Ken Livingstone had sufficient devolved powers to introduce the charge on his own authority, other cities would require the confirmation of the Secretary of State for Transport. Manchester proposed a peak time congestion charge scheme which would have been implemented in 2011/2012. This was rejected in a referendum held on 12 December 2008 by over 70% of voters. Plans for similar charges in both the West Midlands and East Midlands have also been rejected. The government has proposed a nationwide scheme of road tolls, but public opposition has been fierce and included a petition of nearly 2 million signatories on the 10 Downing Street website. In an article in the Sunday Times in December 2007, the author describes how he believes that the failure of the London scheme, in terms of value for money, could undermine the Government's desire to convince other parts of the UK to introduce similar schemes. The scheme was rejected in a public referendum in February 2005. ;Manchester 2007 A scheme similar to the one in London was proposed in Manchester, covering a wider area but with a much smaller daily charging window covering the morning and evening rush hours. However, this was overwhelmingly rejected when voted upon in Greater Manchester. ;Cambridge 2007 A scheme for Cambridge is currently under consideration and the subject of heated public debate, with council surveys showing that a majority of Cambridge-area residents reject the scheme. West Midlands 2008; In March 2008, councils from across the West Midlands, including those from Birmingham and Coventry, rejected the idea of imposing road pricing schemes on the area, this was despite promises from central government of transport project funding in exchange for the implementation of a road pricing pilot scheme. ;East Midlands 2008 Similar schemes proposed for cities in the East Midlands have also been dropped. =National road pricing proposal (2005-2007)= Extensive studies were done in 2005 related to a proposed national scheme for the UK, with an aim to implementation at the earliest around 2013.https://web.archive.org/web/20060523213504/ In October 2005 the UK government suggested they explore \\"piggy-backing\\" road pricing on private sector technologies, such as usage based insurance (also known as pay-as-you- drive, or PAYD). This method would avoid a large-scale public sector procurement exercise, but such products are unlikely to penetrate the mass market. If introduced, this scheme would likely see a charge being levied per kilometre depending on the time of day, the road being driven along, and perhaps the type of vehicle. For example, a large car driving along the western section of the M25 in rush hour would pay a high charge; a small car driving along a rural lane would pay a much lower charge. The very highest charges would be likely in the most congested urban areas. It is expected that rural motorists would benefit the most from such a scheme, perhaps by paying less through road pricing than they do at present through petrol and car taxes, whereas urban motorists would pay much more than they presently do. However, this is highly dependent on whether such a scheme would be designed to be either revenue neutral or congestion neutral. A revenue neutral scheme would replace (at least in part) petrol and vehicle taxes, and would be such that Treasury revenue under the new scheme would equal the revenue from current taxes. A congestion neutral scheme would be designed so that growth in congestion levels would stop as a result of the new charges; the latter scheme would require significantly higher (and increasingly higher) charges than the revenue neutral scheme and so would be unpopular with the UK's 30 million motorists. The carbon emission consequence of moving from fuel duty to a charge per mile has been raised as a concern by some environmentalists, as has any diversionary response from heavily trafficked (and hence more expensive) roads. The UK government announced funding for road pricing research in seven local areas in November 2005.http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=179352&NewsAreaID;=2&NavigatedFromDepartment;=False In June 2005, Transport Secretary Alistair Darling announced the current proposals to introduce road pricing. Every vehicle would be fitted with a satellite receiver to calculate charges, with prices (including fuel duty) ranging from 2p per mile on un-congested roads to ¬£1.34 on the most congested roads at peak times. A 2007 online petition against road pricing attracted over 1.8 million signatures, equivalent to 6% of the entire driving population. Over 150,000 signatures were added during the last day before the petition closed on 20 February 2007. In reply, the prime minister e-mailed the petitioners outlining his rationale, denying that the proposals were to introduce a stealth tax or increase surveillance, and promising 'debate' before a decision was made as to whether to introduce a national scheme. Also, in a recent poll 74% of those questioned opposed road pricing.

His conviction was overturned due to unethical behavior by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its chief witness. Early life Lerner was from Brookline, Massachusetts. He played baseball for his high school, batting .364 in his senior year. After he graduated, Lerner signed with the Washington Senators, and played professional baseball through 1963. Patriarca Family murder trial Lerner, Patriarca family boss Raymond Patriarca and three other members of the family, Robert Fairbrothers, John Rossi, and Rudolph Sciarra, were tried in 1970 for murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Irish Mafia mobster John \\"Red\\" Kelley, a sometime associate of the family, gave testimony as a cooperating witness linking Lerner, Patriarca and other family members to the 1968 murder of Rudolph \\"Rudy\\" Marfeo and Anthony Melei. Kelley testified he had been contracted by Lerner to help plan the hit on Marfeo and Melei, whom Lerner allegedly murdered with a shotgun. After the trial, Kelley went into the federal witness protection program. Lerner and Patriarca were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Lerner also was convicted of two counts of murder for which he was sentenced to two life terms in addition to the ten years for conspiracy, all of the sentences to be served consecutively. The jury was unable to reach a verdict for the other defendants. While serving time at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institution it is said that Lerner was a model inmate. He was known as a peacemaker, excellent player-coach of the softball team and once saved the life of a Correctional Officer.. Lerner's conviction subsequently was overturned by the Rhode Island Supreme Court in 1988. It had been established that Kelley had perjured himself at the trial, as had F.B.I. Special Agent H. Paul Rico, who had collaborated Kelley's testimony. The Court ruled, in the case Lerner v. Moran 542 A.2d 1089 (1988), that > ...that Kelley's perjury, elicited by the FBI, constituted material > exculpatory evidence withheld in violation of the applicant's due-process > rights.

Ltd. which is now owned by Boeing Australia and known as Boeing Aerostructures Australia. Following the downturn of aviation manufacturing in the late 1950s, the Australian subsidiary of de Havilland looked to produce products utilizing the skills and knowledge available to the company. It found a ready market in the production of a range of small aluminium boats made using techniques similar to those employed in the aircraft industry. de Havilland Marine's designers were initially headed by Frank Bailey, the Vampire Production Engineering Manager, starting in 1959. Later designers included in 1966 naval architect Alan Payne, designer of Australia's first America's Cup (1962 America's Cup) challengers Gretel and Gretel II. de Havilland Australia built the mast and rig for Gretel. In 1965, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the marine division had produced 15,000 craft of all types, with a projected annual production of 5,000 craft per year.Advertisement for De Havilland boats (26 February 1965). By the end of the small boat production in the 1970s over 55,000 had been produced de Havilland Marine (Large Craft) (registered company number F11799) was located on the waters edge at 5-7 Burroway Road, Homebush Bay. Due to a lack of new business it closed its doors in 1982. In the years prior it manufactured various large aluminium craft for both the local and international market. These included Carpentaria Class Patrol Boats for Burma & the Solomon Islands, Titan Work Boats for the New South Wales (NSW) government, and the hulls of the Nepean Bell which still operates on the Nepean River in NSW. History de Havilland Australia opened in Melbourne in March 1927 as de Havilland Aircraft Pty. Ltd. In 1930 the company moved to Bankstown (a suburb of Sydney), where it acted as an agency for the parent company, with assembly, repair and spares facilities for its range of aircraft. Aircraft design and full manufacture by de Havilland Australia (DHA) did not take place until the Second World War. Following the end of the war, the Australian company diversified into an aircraft sales agency and engineering and marine craft manufacturing. In 1960, following the takeover of the parent company de Havilland Holdings Ltd of England by the Hawker Siddeley Group, de Havilland Australia was renamed Hawker de Havilland. The company is now owned by Boeing Australia, who announced on 6 February 2009 that Hawker de Havilland would be known as Boeing Aerostructures Australia. Marine craft Following a report in January 1959 by Daryl Murray Jones to the New Products Committee, it was recommended that small aluminium boat production be started in time to meet the Spring selling season, starting with an 11/12 foot dinghy. A naval architect designed prototype was commissioned, following which Frank Bailey, the Vampire Production Engineering Manager, redesigned it to be easier and cheaper to make, while also making it more attractive to the anticipated market. On 21 September 1959 the Board approved the manufacture of 50 12 foot boats, all of which had been sold by 31 December 1959. By the end of 1960, 1100 boats of four different models had been made and sold. The brand name Topper was also adopted in 1960, intended initially to demonstrate that these lightweight and strong boats were suitable for transporting on a car top. While Frank Bailey designed the first aluminium 12 foot Tiki sailing boat and 12 foot fibreglass Vagabond, de Havilland Marine later produced three small fibreglass yachts designed by Alan Payne, following trials from 1966. These were the 10 foot Gipsy, the 16 foot Corsair and the 18 foot six inch trailer/sailer Rambler. By 1976 with 549 made, the Corsair had become a national class, sailed in five Australian states and Papua New Guinea, with its production continuing to this day. As part of a range of marketing activities to promote the strength and sea worthiness of the aluminium boats, Leon Simons and Bryan Dodd from de Havilland Marine took a de Havilland \\"Sea Topper\\" from Sydney to Melbourne (a distance of 700 miles), on 8 July 1965. Ben Lexcen and Craig Whitworth of Miller and Whitworth joined with de Havilland Marine in 1964 to design, produce and market a range of aluminium yacht spars which started to replace the traditional wooden spars. In 1960, de Havilland Marine also obtained a license to produce a power boat using a water jet propulsion system developed by Bill Hamilton, founder of C.W.F. Hamilton & Co of New Zealand. A prototype hull was equipped with a propulsion unit and was tested at Rose Bay, New South Wales. =Manufacturing process= The first stage in the manufacturing of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a brake press and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was by means of a 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a half-hard condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a curing oven to bring them to full- hard condition. The skin sections were welded on wooden jigs on which the seats, gunwales, decks and extruded sections were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop.Advertisement for De Havilland Topper (26 November 1965). de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fittedPatent US2760400 (1956).

The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding. In its advertisements, de Havilland Marine referred to this riveting process by the Sealomatic name. =Logo and branding= The company logo was similar to other members of the de Havilland group in that the letters D and H were superimposed on the wings of an aircraft, which in turn were overlaid onto the design of a ship's anchor. A number of logo variants were used during the marine division's existence in newspaper advertisements. During 1966, the division was styled Hawker de Havilland Marine often followed by the craft range, i.e. Feathercraft Division. =Range of craft= de Havilland Marine manufactured craft from yachts and sportboats to workboats: from the Toppercraft range, Sea Topper, Standard Topper, Topper Cub, and Topper Playboy; from the Feathercraft range,1966 Advertisement for De Havilland (11 November 1966). Apache, Bobcat, Comanche, Mustang, Pawnee, and Seminole; from the Yacht range, Corsair, Gipsy 3 m (10 ft) cat-rigged, and Vagabond; other craft include the Customs boat, Hercules, John, and Norseman.

Early life  He was born in Anchang, an ancient city in what is now Sichuan Province. According to traditional biographies, he became a monk at the age of eleven. The scholar Morten Schl√ºtter calls Qingliao, along with his fellow student Hongzhi Zhengjue, \\"the most illustrious representative of the Caodong tradition in the Song [Dynasty].\\" Multiple sources contain a story about Qingliao regarding an event that took place after he received dharma transmission from his teacher Danxia Zichun. After leaving his teacher, he became the head monk at a monastery on Mt. Changlu, whose abbot was Zuzhao Daohe of the Yunmen school. Daohe offered to allow Qingliao to become the abbot of the monastery, inherit his robe, and serve as his heir. Qingliao said he would become abbot, but could not be Daohe's heir since Zichun had already given him dharma transmission. Daohe later left the monastery without passing on his position, but ultimately Qingliao was instructed by a fiscal commissioner named Chen to take charge of the monastery. The students there apparently were amazed at his degree of loyalty to his original teacher. This story has historical significance because it suggests that Qingliao could have accepted Daohe‚Äôs offer to essentially switch heirs, indicating that teacher-student transmission was probably more flexible than often thought. Zhenxie Qingliao is also remembered as the initial target of the koan advocate Dahui Zonggao's attacks on silent illumination-style meditation.

Aspioti-ELKA () was one of the largest publishing and printing enterprises of Greece. Founded in 1873 in Corfu by Gerasimos Aspiotis as a factory manufacturing playing cards under the name Elpis it eventually merged with the Etairia Lithographias kai Kytiopoieias Athenon (ELKA) and finally became Aspioti-ELKA. In business for over a century, Aspioti-ELKA was the oldest company of its kind in Greece when it folded in 1997. During the post-WWII period Aspioti-ELKA was one of the largest employers in the printing and publishing business in Greece up to 1985. In 1992 the company was sold by the National Bank of Greece to Jean Jacques Lesueur and in October 1997 it was declared bankrupt. History In 1873, Gerasimos Aspiotis founded a playing-card factory in Corfu under the name Elpis (Hope). In 1884, Aspiotis secured a contract with the government of Charilaos Trikoupis as the sole manufacturer of playing cards for Greece. The cards were designed by Gerasimos Aspiotis' father Nikolaos Aspiotis who was a painter. In 1902 Konstantinos Aspiotis, son of Gerasimos, became the director of the company. Under the directorship of Konstaninos Aspiotis the company product line expanded to include the printing of bonds, shares, advertisements, tickets and other similar products. After the Balkan Wars and the subsequent expansion of Greek lands, the company increased its market share in an expanded internal market. Sales of its popular playing cards increased significantly and so did the company profits. In 1935 Liakos Iliopoulos became the director of the company and presided over further expansion which lasted until 1940. On 28 October 1940, the starting date of the Greco-Italian War, the Italian Air force bombed and destroyed the Aspioti- ELKA factory in Corfu. On that same day the Greek Government, after a lengthy delay of many months, granted Aspioti-ELKA permission to move its machinery and equipment from the Corfu factory to its Athens plant. The machinery moving permit came one day too late as the plant including the machinery now laid in ruins. The National Bank of Greece keeps a large collection of the company material assets which were manufactured or acquired throughout its history. The bank collection includes stamps, banknotes, advertisements, architectural drawings, financial and statistical tables, an extensive collection of old machinery and other items.

Apple Inc., In the Matter of Certain Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, ITC Inv. No. 337-TA-745, 2010-10-6. The complaint allegations concerned six Motorola patents, and sought remedies of a court-ordered bar on U.S. imports of infringing products, and an injunction prohibiting Apple from importing, marketing and distributing infringing products. The ITC instituted its investigation a month later and Motorola subsequently dropped its patent claims with respect to two of the six patents at issue.Form 10-K Annual Report, Motorola Mobility, Inc., 2012-2-17, pp 37-38. Motorola also filed two complaints for patent infringement against Apple in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Illinois Complaints), and another complaint for patent infringement against Apple in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Florida Complaint). Both complaints alleged Apple infringed 18 Motorola patents. In November 2010, Motorola voluntarily dismissed the Illinois Complaints, (asserted as counterclaims in the actions brought by Apple on October 29, 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin). Later that November, Apple also filed counterclaims in the Southern District of Florida, alleging Motorola infringed six Apple patents in manufacturing and selling mobile devices, set-top boxes and digital video recorders. Additionally, in October 2010, Motorola filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against Apple and NeXT Software, Inc.Motorola Mobility, Inc. v. Apple Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc., U.S. Dist. Ct., Dist. Del., 2010-10-8. in the U.S. District Court in Delaware, seeking a ruling that Motorola did not infringe any claim of twelve patents owned by Apple and NeXT. In response, in early December 2010, Apple asserted these twelve patents against Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc. in the Western District of Wisconsin and moved for a change of venue from Delaware to Wisconsin. Ultimately, both parties' patent assertions were subsequently transferred to the Northern District of Illinois. This led the way for Apple to take charge over Motorola, Samsung, LG, and many other cellular communications companies. Apple's counter-suits In late October 2010, Apple filed two complaints in the Western District of Wisconsin for patent infringement against Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc.Apple Inc. v. Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc., U.S. Dist. Ct., W.Dist. Wisc., 2010-10-29. The complaints alleged Motorola infringed six patents and sought money damages and an injunction. In early November 2010, Motorola filed counterclaims against Apple alleging Apple infringed twelve Motorola patents which Motorola originally asserted in the Northern District of Illinois. The Western District of Wisconsin transferred the actions to the Northern District of Illinois and trial was scheduled for June 2012 on six Apple patents and three Motorola Mobility patents. Also in late October 2010, Apple filed a complaint with the ITC for patent infringement against Motorola, Inc. and Motorola Mobility, Inc.In the Matter of Certain Mobile Devices and Related Software, ITC Inv. No. 337-TA-750, 2010-10-29. Apple's complaint alleged Motorola infringed three Apple patents with Motorola's mobile devices offered in the U.S.. Apple's complaint sought a court order barring imports of those devices and sought an injunction prohibiting Motorola from engaging in further activities related to the same mobile devices. The ITC began investigation in late November 2010; in mid-January 2012, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found no violation by Motorola for the three asserted Apple patents; Apple filed a petition to review the ALJ's findings but the ALJ ultimately ruled for Motorola and against Apple in mid-March 2012.Campbell, Mikey, Final ITC ruling clears Motorola of Apple patent infringement, appleinsider.com, 2012-3-17. See also the ITC's ruling, in the case Apple v. Motorola, 337-TA-750, 2012-3-16. In mid-March 2011, Apple filed counterclaims against Motorola in the ITC proceeding (which was subsequently removed to the Western District of Wisconsin court), and instituted a new action in the Western District of Wisconsin, Apple Inc. v. Motorola Mobility, Inc., alleging that Motorola breached standards commitments (see Context, below), with counterclaims including equitable estoppel, waiver, breach of contract, violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, unfair competition and interference with contract. Apple sought declaratory judgments that Motorola's license terms involving standards-essential patents were unreasonable and discriminatory, that Motorola was not entitled to injunctive relief, and that Motorola committed patent misuse. This led the way for Motorola to take over Apple in the military industry, because they were hired to work for the US government. Context Components manufacturers and major patent holders such as Motorola and Samsung commit to licensing their standards essential patents to other industry participants through their participation in standard-setting organizations (SSOs), while other industry participants negotiate licenses to use those patents, including manufactures and sellers of smartphones and tablets.Contreras, Jorge L., The Frand Wars: Who‚Äôs on First?, Patent Law Journal Blog (Patently-O), patentlyo.com, 2012-4-17.

North American technology companies' treatment in the marketplace of their respective products and mobile operating systems (OSs) spans the spectrum from completely proprietary systems to open-source license systems: Apple and RIM manufacture and sell products that run on only their respective proprietary mobile OSs; Microsoft licenses its proprietary mobile OSs, (Windows Phone and Windows Mobile), to non-affiliated wireless handset original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); and Google sponsors Android, an open-source mobile OS it distributes free to OEMs.DOJ, Competitive Landscape, U.S. Dept. of Justice, justice.gov, 2012-2-13. Accessed 2012-4-13. All these OSs provide platforms for software application developers as well as for a variety of products and services offered by competing product manufacturers. Such products in turn rely on, and their patent holders commit to, SSOs' rules for both standards essential patents disclosure and reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing (FRAND) grants for compatibility and interoperability of devices. This led the way for Apple to take charge over Motorola, Samsung, LG, and other cellular communications companies. Further developments In March and April 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement complaints in the court in Mannheim, Germany, alleging that Apple Retail Germany GmbH, Apple Sales International, and Apple Inc. infringed three of Motorola Mobility's patents, two of which are standards-essential patents. In December 2011 and February 2012, the court in Mannheim, Germany found that Apple products infringed two of the three Motorola Mobility patents, one standards-essential and one non-essential, and granted injunctions. Between May and December 2011, Apple filed patent infringement suits in Munich, D√ºsseldorf and Mannheim, Germany alleging that Motorola infringed Apple's utility and design patents. Apple asserted the design patents against Motorola's tablet products. In mid-February 2012, the Munich court found that a Motorola smartphone unlock feature infringed one of the Apple utility patents,Compare utility model to a utility patent. and granted an injunction. Five days prior to the Munich court decision, Apple sued Motorola in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.Apple, Inc. and Apple Sales International v. Motorola Mobility, Inc., case 12CV0355 JLS BLM, U.S. Dist. Ct., S.D. Cal., 2012-2-10. Apple's complaint sought a declaratory judgment and injunction based on an alleged breach of contract by Motorola, and alleged that Apple is a third party beneficiary under a patent licensing agreement between Motorola Mobility, Inc. and Qualcomm, Inc., and thus in reliance on that contract. Apple alleged that Motorola's rights under two patents it asserted against Apple in Germany were already exhausted under the licensing agreement and asked the court to enjoin Motorola from prosecuting and enforcing its claims against Apple in Germany. In February 2012, the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission sent Motorola notice that the Commission received a complaint by Apple on the enforcement of Motorola's standards-essential patents against Apple, allegedly in breach of Motorola's FRAND commitments. Apple's complaint sought the Commission's intervention with respect to standards-essential patents. See also * Smartphone wars * Apple Inc. litigation * Apple Inc. v.

The company is based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and was founded as LanFan Technologies in February 1986. Two versions of the software are available: LanSchool, the locally hosted version that comes with the full feature set, and LanSchool Air, the cloud- based version that includes a smaller feature set and is delivered as a cloud- based product. Both versions enable teachers to monitor students‚Äô screens while in class, limit the websites students may visit, ‚Äúpush‚Äù a website to open on all classroom devices, and message the class. LanSchool is available in North America and Europe in 15 languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Arabic, Korean, Hebrew, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, Hungarian, and Serbian.  Technology  LanSchool's locally hosted software uses a proprietary remote desktop protocol that communicates over a local area network via TCP and UDP. A console application is installed on the teacher's computer, which communicates peer-to-peer with a software agent running on the pupils' computers. LanSchool can function on the Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, iOS, and Android operating systems.https://www.lenovosoftware.com/support/lanschool/specifications LanSchool Air is delivered as a cloud-based software, accessible through the teacher and students‚Äô browsers and managed by Lenovo Software. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS operating systems.  History  Originally named LanFan Technologies, the company was founded in February 1986 when Dana Doggett began exploring the concept of a software application that would allow an instructor to control multiple computers. Doggett developed a software tool called PC Chalkboard that was then implemented by Novell. PC Chalkboard allowed Novell lab instructors to broadcast their screens to each PC in the lab. LanSchool was licensed by both Intel and IBM and actively marketed through each company's education sales channel. In April 2001, Doggett left Intel and formed a new company, LanSchool Technologies, LLC, where he could work on LanSchool full-time. Acquisitions LanSchool was acquired by Stoneware in 2011. In September 2012, Lenovo announced the acquisition of Stoneware which was completed on December 26, 2012.  Security  There have been cases of students being able to exploit the LanSchool software to bypass restrictions, and in some cases take control of other student computers. A 2006 post on CompSci.ca details the packet structure of older versions of the software, and claims there was no encryption or similar precautions.

The Anglican missionary constructed a number of churches in Nova Scotia. Early life Simon Gibbons is believed to have been born at Forteau, Newfoundland and Labrador, on June 21, 1851, to Thomas Gibbons, a fisherman, and an Inuit woman who died giving birth. Some stories, possibly legends later circulated by Gibbons, have him found as a child on an ice-floe off the coast of Labrador. The first document about Gibbons shows him as a six-year-old child admitted to the Church of England Widows and Orphans Asylum in St John's in 1857 upon the death of his father, along with three brothers and a sister in law. Three years later, Gibbons entered a school run by the Reverend George Poulett Harris, and the promising student was also taught by a Reverend Mr Hutchinson at Tilt Cove. In 1862, Gibbons was taken off the orphanage rolls, because he was taken by a clergy widow, Sophia Mountain, lady superintendent of the asylum. In 1867 she married Edward Feild, Bishop of Newfoundland. In 1875, Gibbons moved to Quebec to work as a lay reader, teacher and catechist, as well as to tutor the son of the Clarenceville rector for admission to the university. There he met Frances Eliza DuVernet, the rector's daughter, whom he would later marry. Peter's and Saint John's Anglican Church, constructed by Gibbons in 1883 Priesthood Gibbons attended King's College at Windsor, Nova Scotia from 1876 to 1877, studying for the priesthood. Bishop Hibbert Binney ordained Gibbons a deacon on February 25, 1877, and a priest on March 25 the following year. He became a travelling missionary in Victoria County on Cape Breton Island. He serving the many fishermen there and their families, often travelling using snowshoes in conditions too severe for horse and wagon or sleigh. Gibbons became known for his education, intellect and sense of humour, as well as his physical stamina and endurance. In 1881 and 1882, Gibbons travelled to England to solicit funds to build churches in his district, preaching in Westminster Abbey and being introduced to Queen Victoria. He laconically stated \\"my face was my fortune\\", alluding to what Canon Morris referred to as his \\"Eskimo physique\\". Upon returning in 1883, Gibbons built two churches and a mission house, as well as gave his bishop $4500 to endow the mission. One of the churches was Saint Peter's and Saint John's Anglican Church in Baddeck, Nova Scotia. In 1885, Gibbons traveled to the West Indies to regain his health, then was relocated to the parish of Lockeport, Nova Scotia where he served three congregations in a circuit along 35 miles of coastline. In 1888, after another trip to Britain to secure funding, Gibbons again relocated, this time to Parrsboro, where he oversaw the construction of three churches. Architecture Gibbons may have visited Cambridge during his visits to England. The churches that he subsequently built in Canada reflect the style of the Cambridge Camden Society. His churches were designed in a simple style, reminiscent of medieval European churches but using wood rather than stone. A distinctive feature of his churches, is the use of Rhenish helm, or Rhineland helmet, bell towers. Death and legacy Gibbons died on December 14, 1896, in Parrsboro, where he was buried. The Canadian Calendar of Holy Persons of the Anglican Church of Canada remembers Gibbons on the anniversary of his death, December 14. An inukshuk was recently raised to honour the missionary on the Diligent River where he worked in his final years.

Sardines are a source of omega-3 fatty acids. Sardines are often served in cans, but can also be eaten grilled, pickled, or smoked when fresh. Sardines are related to herrings, both in the family Clupeidae. The term sardine was first used in English during the early 15th century, and may come from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, around which sardines were once abundant. The terms sardine and pilchard are not precise, and what is meant depends on the region. The United Kingdom's Sea Fish Industry Authority, for example, classifies sardines as young pilchards. One criterion suggests fish shorter in length than are sardines, and larger ones pilchards. The FAO/WHO Codex standard for canned sardines cites 21 species that may be classed as sardines; FishBase, a comprehensive database of information about fish, calls at least six species just 'pilchard', over a dozen just 'sardine', and many more with both those two basic names qualified by various adjectives. Sardines are commercially fished for a variety of uses: bait, immediate consumption, canning, drying, salting, smoking, and reduction into fish meal or fish oil. The chief use of sardines is for human consumption, fish meal is used as animal feed, while sardine oil has many uses, including the manufacture of paint, varnish, and linoleum. Nutrition Sardines are rich in vitamins and minerals. A small serving of sardines once a day can provide up to 13% of the RDA (recommended daily allowance) value of vitamin B2, roughly one-quarter of the RDA of niacin, and about 150% of the RDA of vitamin B12. All B vitamins help to support proper nervous system function and are used for energy metabolism, or converting food into energy. Also, sardines are high in the major minerals such as phosphorus, calcium, potassium, and some trace minerals such as iron and selenium. Sardines are also a natural source of marine omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggest the regular consumption of omega-3 fatty acids reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease and can even boost brain function. These fatty acids may also help lower blood sugar levels a small amount. They are also a good source of vitamin D, calcium, and protein. Because they are low in the food chain, sardines are very low in contaminants, such as mercury, relative to other fish commonly eaten by humans. Canned sardines Sardines are canned in many different ways. At the cannery, the fish are washed, their heads are removed, and the fish are then smoked or cooked, either by deep-frying or by steam- cooking, after which they are dried. They are then packed in either olive, sunflower, or soybean oil, water, or in a tomato, chili, or mustard sauce. Canned sardines in supermarkets may actually be sprat (such as the ‚Äúbrisling sardine‚Äù) or round herrings. Fish sizes vary by species. Good-quality sardines should have the head and gills removed before packing. They may also be eviscerated before packing (typically the larger varieties). If not, they should be purged of undigested or partially digested food or feces by holding the live fish in a tank long enough for them to empty their digestive systems. Sardines are typically tightly packed in a small can which is scored for easy opening, either with a pull tab like that on a beverage can or with a key attached to the bottom or side of the can. Thus, it has the benefit of being an easily portable, nonperishable, self-contained food. The close packing of sardines in the can has led to their metaphorical use in the term, \\"packed like sardines\\", to describe any situation where people or objects are crowded tightly together such as in a bus or nightclub. It has also been used as the name of a children's game, where one person hides and each successive person who finds the hidden one packs into the same space until only one is left out, who becomes the next one to hide. Around the world =Canada= The last remaining sardine packing plant in North America is in Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick. The Brunswick brand, which started as the Connors Brothers in the 1880s, produces sardines (actually, juvenile herring, Clupea harengus) with many flavours. Brunswick claims to be the largest sardine producer in the world. =England= Stargazy pie - pilchards cooked in a pie crust that is made in Cornwall Pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) fishing and processing was a thriving industry in Cornwall from around 1750 to around 1880, after which it went into an almost terminal decline. However, as of 2007, stocks are improving.River Cottage: Gone Fishing 22/11/08 Since 1997, sardines from Cornwall have been sold as \\"Cornish sardines\\", and since March 2010, under EU law, Cornish sardines have Protected Geographical Status. The industry has featured in numerous works of art, particularly by Stanhope Forbes and other Newlyn School artists. A traditional Cornish pilchard dish is stargazy pie. =Croatia= Fishing for sardela or sardina (Sardina pilchardus) on the coasts of Dalmatia and Istria began thousands of years ago. The region was part of the Roman Empire, then largely a Venetian dominion, and has always been sustained through fishing mainly sardines. All along the coast, many towns promote the age-old practice of fishing by lateen sail boats for tourism and on festival occasions. Today, industrial producers continue this tradition. Currently, the four factories of canned sardines are in Rovinj, Zadar, Postira, and Sali (the latter founded in 1905). Several famous dishes made with sardines include, for instance, komi≈°ka pogaƒça (a pie with salted sardines and tomato sauce), saur or in≈°avor (sardines fried and then cooled, seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, garlic, black pepper and rosemary) and sardines roasted on stick from Sali, dugi otok. =France= Sardine fishing and canning is a traditional industry in Brittany, where most French canneries remain. The area is known as the place where sardine canning was invented. Douarnenez was the world's leading sardine exporter in the 19th century. The sardines are fried, dried, and then canned (this traditional process is labelled pr√©par√©es √† l'ancienne), whereas in most other countries, processing consists of steam cooking after canning. =Greece= Small oily fish like sardines have been a staple of the Greek diet since antiquity. Popular especially during the summer months of July and August, and praised as a high- quality healthy food source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids, sardines are mostly consumed grilled with lemon and garlic, or cured in salt and olive oil (œÄŒ±œÉœÑŒ≠œÇ, past√©s). Both dishes are standard items in Greek-style seaside \\"taverna\\" restaurants, or in smaller establishments served as a treat (ŒºŒµŒ∂Œ≠œÇ, meze) usually accompanied by ouzo. This does not leave out other ways of cooking sardines with local recipes and varieties. The place most associated with sardines and their consumption as ouzomeze (ŒøœÖŒ∂ŒøŒºŒµŒ∂Œ≠œÇ i.e. meze treat with ouzo) is the island of Lesvos. A fine kind of the fish called papalina thrives in the island's wide bay of Kalloni, and ouzo production has been a long tradition in the area of Plomari. A handful of manufacturers of Lesvos produce and export canned sardines, considered a local delicacy. \\"Sardine festivals\\" are celebrated during summertime in Lesvos, as well as in many fishing communities elsewhere in Greece, which emphasize folklore aspects of traditional life and music, and allow for various amounts of fish consumption. =India= The sardine is a favorite food of the Keralites and the people of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and coastal Karnataka. The fish is typically eaten fresh, and canned sardines are not popular. Fried sardines are a much sought- after delicacy. They are called chala (Malayalam: ‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥≥) or mathi (Malayalam: ‡¥Æ‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø) in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Andhra Pradesh, they are called kavallu amongst the fishing community. In West Bengal, they are called khoira (Bengali: ‡¶ñ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶∞‡¶æ). People from coastal Karnataka call them pedvo (Konkani) or bhootai (Tulu). Sardines are cheaper in India than larger fish like seer or pomfret, making them a low-cost delicacy. They are consumed in various forms, including deep-fried and pan-fried preparations, or made into curries of various types. =Italy= Owing to proximity with Sardinia, both the northern and southern regions of Italy claim main courses or appetizers with sardine fish as a primary ingredient. Sicily's regional dish, pasta con le sarde, is a spaghetti or bucatini entree with sardines, fennel seed, saffron, raisins, garlic, onion, olive oil, white wine, lemon juice, pureed tomato, toasted breadcrumbs, and crushed almonds. In Venice, sardines in saor is an antipasto that consists of sardine steaks marinated in white wine, raisins, and vinegar, subsequently covered in flour and fried in olive oil, then garnished with parsley, onions, crushed almonds, and raisins. =Japan= File:Niboshipackage.JPGDried niboshi (sardines) in and out of the package, used in Japanese cooking File:Young of sardines rice,Yaizu- city,Japan.JPGYoung sardines on rice File:Mezashi by Kossy@FINEDAYS in Tokyo.jpgSardines with lemon File:Wakame and fish.jpgA Japanese dish with garlic, wakame, soy sauce, and \\"oil saldina\\" *See also Tatami iwashi =Morocco= Morocco is the largest canned sardine exporter in the world and the leading supplier of sardines to the European market. Sardines represent more than 62% of the Moroccan fish catch and account for 91% of raw material usage in the domestic canning industry. Some 600,000 tonnes of fresh sardines are processed each year by the industry. Famous Moroccan recipes include Moroccan fried stuffed sardines and Moroccan sardine balls in spicy tomato sauce. =Norway= Until the discovery of oil fields in the fishing areas, sardine canning was the main activity of the city of Stavanger. Today, only a sardine museum remains among the refineries in Stavanger. =Peru= Peru has a long history of direct human consumption of Engraulis ringens and other sardines, reaching into ancient cultures, including Chim√∫ culture, Paracas culture, Pachacamac, and most importantly the oldest known civilization in the Americas, the Caral-Supe civilization, which was based almost completely on E. ringens consumption. Nonetheless, since the 1950s, the overwhelming destination for captured E. ringens (anchoveta or Peruvian sardine) has been as the principal input for reduction fishery in the production of fishmeal and fish oil, with minuscule quantities destined for direct human consumption. Due to a combination of environmental and regulatory effects, since 2000, the Peruvian catch has ranged from 9.58 million metric tons (MT) to a low of 5.35 million MT, with the reported 2009 catch concluding at 5.35 million MT. Alt URL In recent years, direct human consumption (local and for export) has reached about 110,000 MT (about 2% of catch) due to evangelical promotion of health, environmental, and economic benefits, such as Mistura 2010, coupled with government and NGO activities, e.g. www.anchoveta.info, and private- sector offers from local supermarkets. =Portugal= Sardines play an important role in Portuguese cuisine and culture. Historically a people who depend heavily on the sea for food and commerce, the Portuguese have a predilection for fish in their popular festivities. The most important is Saint Anthony's day, June 13, when Portugal's biggest popular festival takes place in Lisbon, where grilled sardines are the snack of choice. Almost every place in Portugal, from Figueira da Foz to Portalegre, from P√≥voa de Varzim to Olh√£o, has the summertime tradition of eating grilled sardines (sardinhas assadas).

On the Atlantic coast, fried sardines are commonly served as tapas with drinks or as the first course of a meal. On the Mediterranean coast, grilling is more common.

They are generally prepared grilled or steamed in ovens, most commonly served as a main course alongside alcoholic beverages, most notably rakƒ±, the archetypal Turkish liquor. Particularly in the Gallipoli peninsula and in the Aegean region of Turkey, sardines are oven-cooked rolled in grape leaves. They are also canned especially in factories in coastal cities such as ƒ∞stanbul, Gelibolu, √áanakkale, Bandƒ±rma, Karadeniz Ereƒüli, Ordu, and Trabzon. =United States= Sardine fleet in Maine c. 1940s In the United States, the sardine canning industry peaked in the 1950s. Since then, the industry has been on the decline. The last large sardine cannery in the United States, the Stinson Seafood plant in Prospect Harbor, Maine, closed its doors on April 15, 2010, after 135 years in operation.

Located in the central quarter of Kolonos, it resulted from the merger of the city's two main railway terminals‚Äîthe Larissa Station (, Stathm√≥s Lar√≠sis) of the Piraeus‚ÄìPlaty railway towards central and northern Greece, and the Peloponnese Station (, Stathm√≥s Peloponn√≠sou) of the Piraeus‚ÄìPatras railway linking Athens with the Peloponnese. It is still colloquially known as Larissa Station, which is also the name of the adjacent Metro station. History Inaugurated in 1904, the station was named after the city of Larissa, then the northernmost city of the Kingdom of Greece and the one nearest the northern terminus of the standard-gauge Piraeus‚ÄìPapapouli railway. The adjacent Peloponnese Station (), inaugurated on 30 June 1884, was served by the metre-gauge Piraeus‚ÄìPatras railway to the Peloponnese. Closed on 7 August 2005, along with the metre-gauge line between Piraeus and Agioi Anargyroi, its services were transferred to Larissa Station upon the opening of the Proastiakos line to Corinth on 27 September 2005. The final service departed the unmodernized Larissa Station on 4 June 2017, before it was closed for various upgrades including the installation of a railway electrification system. The upgraded station was reopened on 30 July 2017. The Athens Metro station, inaugurated on 28 January 2000, lies underground and is served by Line 2 between Anthoupoli and Elliniko. Structure The station comprises a large, two-floor building in central Athens. Three platforms and four tracks are currently in use. A second phase of upgrades is underway, including the construction of new tracks and platforms, a central underpass connecting all platforms and the metro station, additional pedestrian underpasses and overpasses, building restoration works and an overhaul of road traffic surrounding the station. In the meantime, trains will continue to use the platforms and tracks built during the previous upgrade, located where the goods yard of the old Peloponnese Station once stood. Services The station is served by Line 2 of the Athens Metro and by four Proastiakos (suburban) services: Piraeus‚ÄìAthens Airport, Piraeus‚ÄìKiato, Athens‚ÄìChalcis and Aigio‚ÄìAthens. It also serves as the terminus for the regional service to Leianokladi, the express service to Kalambaka and the InterCity/InterCity Express service to Thessaloniki. During the twentieth century, especially in the first half, Athens station was the terminus for some international trains, such as an Express to Berlin (departing from the former Anhalter Bahnhof) or the \\"Arlberg\\"See map on Commons route of the Orient Express (London-Athens via Paris-Z√ºrich-Vienna-Budapest-Belgrade-Skopje), in service until 1962 and then of the Direct Orient Express (Paris-Lausanne-Venice-Ljubljana-Zagreb-Belgrade- Skopje) until 1976.

His ancestral name was Ji, given name Yigao, and Duke Ling was his posthumous title. When his father Duke Xiang of Jin died in 621 BC Yigao was still a young boy. He ascended the throne with the support of his regent Zhao Dun (Ë∂ôÁõæ). In 607 BC, 14 years after ascending the throne, Duke Ling had reached adulthood and become increasingly despotic. He was known to have had his chef killed for not cooking his bear paws well. Zhao Dun, who enjoyed a reputation for integrity and incorruptibility, tried to stop him. Resentful of Zhao Dun's influence, Duke Ling tried to have Zhao assassinated. Zhao Dun managed to escape, and his half-brother Zhao Chuan (Ë∂ôÁ©ø) rebelled and killed Duke Ling. Zhao Dun and Zhao Chuan then installed Duke Ling's uncle, Duke Wen's youngest son Heitun on the throne, who would be known as Duke Cheng of Jin.

He was released in September 2011, and acquitted of most charges in March 2012. Arrest, trial and release On May 29, 2011 Feriani was arrested in Tunis, for allegedly \\"harming the external security of the state\\", \\"releasing and distributing information likely to harm public order\\", and \\"accusing, without proof, a public agent of violating law\\". Before his arrest Feriani sent two letters to Tunisia's internal minister, Habib Essid, in which he named several senior officials, whom he alleged had committed human rights abuses during the Tunisian revolution, and had since then been destroying the evidence. His accusations were reported in two independent Tunisian newspapers, El Khabir and l'Audace, days before his arrest. In response to his arrest, Tunisian activists organized a series of protests, many of them online (using Facebook and Twitter). Feriani's arrest was condemned by the Human Rights Watch. On September 22, Feriani was released by a military court. In March 2012 he was acquitted of major charges, but fined for \\"accusing a public employee of violating law without proof\\". Feriani was satisfied with the outcome, expressing his hopes that it will mark the start of a deeper investigation into the Ministry of Interior's corruption, and that he will be reappointed to his position with the Ministry.

It operated in the following four major cities, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Karachi. Wi-tribe was the first one in Pakistan, as well as South Asia and the Middle East, to launch LTE-Advanced (4.5G) to users. LTE-Advanced was currently only available in Lahore and Karachi, which will soon expand to other places. As of September, witribe no longer works after network breakdown for over two months due to some payments dispute between Edotco and Wi-tribe. Customer service called customers and informed them that company has indeed closed down.  History  In 2009, the wi-tribe group, owned by Qatar Telecom (now Ooredoo) launched its largest operations in Pakistan. In Pakistan, wi-tribe is operating in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.http://www.pta.gov.pk/media/wll_list_090212.pdf Wi-tribe Pakistan is one of the only two telecoms in Pakistan that is an ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales) approved employer. Qatar Telecom invested in wimax technology which, was the leading technology at the time, and set up over 600 towers for base stations across its network at cost close to $200m.  HB Group's acquisition from Qatar Telecom  In March 2016, wi- tribe was acquired by the HB Group from Ooredoo. This followed an Ooredoo Board decision to focus on its core telecoms business, which meant an exit from the Pakistan home broadband internet service provider market. The Citi Group advised and managed the sale of wi-tribe on behalf of Ooredoo. Ooredoo had not invested in the upgrade of the network in recent years and its wimp technology was out of favour globally and a significant upgrade was required both in bandwidth and in the capital costs of upgrading the base stations across over 600 towers. Wimax was substantially now viewed as an end of life technology which only a handful of countries still operated.  Major bandwidth upgrade across Pakistan Network  Within weeks of acquisition, it was clear that the significant congestion on the network was having a hugely detrimental effect on the customer experience, leading to high levels of dissatisfaction and churn and as such required a rapid solution. The previous owners, Ooredoo (formerly Qatar telecom) had been considering increasing capacity and easing congestion since 2014 but uncertainty about its future led to indecision. The investment requirement, coupled with the fact that it was solely a broadband business made no long term sense for the large mobile operator who no longer viewed it as part of its core business and hence meant it was not viewed as a viable investment proposition. Inheriting huge difficulties, in month one the new management decided that an upgrade was crucial for survival and within three months they had invested heavily in improving its customer experience by doubling its spectrum bandwidth across Pakistan. By August 2016, the upgrade had been completed across the entire 600 plus wi-tribe base station towers network in Pakistan.  Pakistan‚Äôs first 4.5G LTE advanced network launched  In November 2016, the management considered investing in 4G LTE home broadband to upgrade its services to meet customer expectations for speed and capacity. The wi-tribe board later announced that it would skip a generation and instead of adopting 4G technology, it would shift to 4.5G LTE Advanced (LTE-A) technology. In February 2017, wi-tribe announced that it had signed a contract with Huawei to upgrade its entire network from WiMAX to an LTE-A (4.5G) network, the most advanced broadband technology in the world. This deployment represented the first such network in South Asia and the Middle East operating 4.5G LTE-A on the 3.5 GHz spectrum (3500 MHz) band. The new 4.5G LTE-A network was installed at Wi-tribe's Head Office in F-8 Islamabad, using equipment from Huawei, with whom wi-tribe signed a USD 15 million contract and a strategic partnership for upgrade of wi-tribes network to LTE-A covering a possibility of five cities, namely Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Karachi, Lahore, and Faisalabad. The network is currently undergoing large scale field tests having proven extremely successful in lab tests and will made available to the public in September 2017. In September 2017, on schedule, Wi-tribe launched its 4.5G LTE Advanced services in Pakistan. In October 2017, Wi-tribe introduced Pakistan's first one terabyte package, which garnered much attention from local consumers. From 2018 wi-tribe rolled out it‚Äôs 4.5G LTE advanced network across Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. The President of Pakistan recognised the 4.5G achievement and awarded wi-tribe the Pakistan New Technology Innovation Award. At the beginning of 2019 Abbas Bokhari, a veteran of the LDI industry, took over as the CEO.  Acquisition of Qubee from PE Fund New Silk Route  In late 2018 the HB Group acquired Qubee, a fellow broadband operator from US-based private equity fund New Silk Route. Qubee‚Äôs network used Wimax technology and HB‚Äôs objective was to upgrade the technology and also create a business and corporate customer entity and shift the traditionally more challenging consumers to wi-tribe.  First successful 5G trials in Pakistan  In 2019, wi-tribe partnered with mobile operator Zong to complete the first successful first 5G trials in Pakistan{{Cite newsurl=https://www.dawn.com/news/1501031  Regulatory Environment and 5G  Since 2019 the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority - Pakistan‚Äôs regulator, has been conducting a review for 5G and the possible reconfiguration of the Telecoms sector in the run-up to many licenses expiring in 2024. wi-tribe has been keen to renew its license so that it could invest to upgrade the whole of the network to 5G, however, without certainty on the license and the payback period for the investment being 9 years it has been waiting for a positive outcome with just 4 years left on the current WLL license.

She was said to be one of the heroines of the tragedy as she, with some of the other socially elite women, assisted in the rowing of one of the Titanic lifeboats. Early life Sketch of Lucile Stewart Polk in the social pages of a Baltimore newspaper in 1892 when she was aged 17. Lucile Stewart Polk was born in 1875 in Baltimore, Maryland.

They had two children, Lucile Polk Carter born in 1897 and William Thornton Carter II born in 1900, who were also passengers on the Titanic and survived. After their marriage, the couple was frequently mentioned in the social pages. Lucile was often noted for her striking clothes.

Accompanying the couple were their two children, Lucile Carter's maid Auguste Serepeca, William Carter's manservant Alexander Cairns, and the chauffeur Charles Aldworth.Encyclopaedia Titanica On the voyage, William Carter brought on board his now famous 25 horsepower Renault automobile. They occupied First Class Cabins B96/98. The original story told in the press regarding the Carter family‚Äôs experience of their ordeal was that William Carter came to the cabin and escorted his family to lifeboat 4. He then left this area with the other men who had taken their wives to this boat. These men were John Astor, George Widener and John Thayer.Mowbray J. H. 1912 Sinking of the Titanic: Eyewitness Accounts, p. 126. William Carter escaped from the Titanic on collapsible lifeboat C (along with Bruce Ismay) but the other three men were lost on the liner. Carter gave details of what happened when she and her two children boarded Lifeboat 4. Her statement was as follows. > When I went over the side with my children and got in the boat there were no > seamen in it. Then came a few men, but there were oars with no one to use > them.

This page is about proof of O(log*n) amortized time Raimund Seidel, Micha Sharir. \\"Top-down analysis of path compression\\", SIAM J. Comput. 34(3):515‚Äì525, 2005 of Union FindRobert E. Tarjan and Jan van Leeuwen. Worst- case analysis of set union algorithms. Journal of the ACM, 31(2):245‚Äì281, 1984. Statement: If m operations, either Union or Find, are applied to n elements, the total run time is O(m log*n), where log* is the iterated logarithm. Proof Lemma 1: As the find function follows the path along to the root, the rank of node it encounters is increasing. :Proof: claim that as Find and Union operations are applied to the data set, this fact remains true over time. Initially when each node is the root of its own tree, it's trivially true. The only case when the rank of a node might be changed is when the Union by Rank operation is applied. In this case, a tree with smaller rank will be attached to a tree with greater rank, rather than vice versa. And during the find operation, all nodes visited along the path will be attached to the root, which has larger rank than its children, so this operation won't change this fact either. Lemma 2: A node u which is root of a subtree with rank r has at least 2r nodes. :Proof: Initially when each node is the root of its own tree, it's trivially true. Assume that a node u with rank r has at least 2r nodes. Then when two trees with rank r Union by Rank and form a tree with rank r + 1, the new node has at least 2r \\\\+ 2r = 2r + 1 nodes. center Lemma 3: The maximum number of nodes of rank r is at most n/2r. :Proof: From lemma 2, we know that a node u which is root of a subtree with rank r has at least 2r nodes. We will get the maximum number of nodes of rank r when each node with rank r is the root of a tree that has exactly 2r nodes. In this case, the number of nodes of rank r is n/2r For convenience, we define \\"bucket\\" here: a bucket is a set that contains vertices with particular ranks. We create some buckets and put vertices into the buckets according to their ranks inductively. That is, vertices with rank 0 go into the zeroth bucket, vertices with rank 1 go into the first bucket, vertices with ranks 2 and 3 go into the second bucket. If the Bth bucket contains vertices with ranks from interval [r, 2r ‚àí 1] = [r, R - 1] then the (B+1)st bucket will contain vertices with ranks from interval [R, 2R ‚àí 1]. Proof of O(\\\\log^*n) Union Find We can make two observations about the buckets. # The total number of buckets is at most log*n #:Proof: When we go from one bucket to the next, we add one more two to the power, that is, the next bucket to [B, 2B ‚àí 1] will be [2B, 22B ‚àí 1] #The maximum number of elements in bucket [B, 2B ‚Äì 1] is at most 2n/2B #:Proof: The maximum number of elements in bucket [B, 2B ‚Äì 1] is at most n/2B \\\\+ n/2B+1 \\\\+ n/2B+2 \\\\+ ‚Ä¶ + n/22B ‚Äì 1 ‚â§ 2n/2B Let F represent the list of \\"find\\" operations performed, and let : T_1 = \\\\sum_F\\\\text{(link to the root)} : T_2 = \\\\sum_F\\\\text{(number of links traversed where the buckets are different)} : T_3 = \\\\sum_F\\\\text{(number of links traversed where the buckets are the same).} Then the total cost of m finds is T = T1 \\\\+ T2 \\\\+ T3 Since each find operation makes exactly one traversal that leads to a root, we have T1 = O(m). Also, from the bound above on the number of buckets, we have T2 = O(mlog*n). For T3, suppose we are traversing an edge from u to v, where u and v have rank in the bucket [B, 2B ‚àí 1] and v is not the root (at the time of this traversing, otherwise the traversal would be accounted for in T1). Fix u and consider the sequence v1,v2,...,vk that take the role of v in different find operations. Because of path compression and not accounting for the edge to a root, this sequence contains only different nodes and because of Lemma 1 we know that the ranks of the nodes in this sequence are strictly increasing. By both of the nodes being in the bucket we can conclude that the length k of the sequence (the number of times node u is attached to a different root in the same bucket) is at most the number of ranks in the buckets B, i.e. at most 2B ‚àí 1 ‚àí B < 2B. Therefore, T_3 \\\\le \\\\sum_{[B, 2^B - 1]} \\\\sum_{u} 2^B. From Observations 1 and 2, we can conclude that T_3\\\\le\\\\sum_{B} 2^B\\\\frac{2n}{2^B}\\\\le 2n\\\\log^*n.

Carrying on the head is a common practice in many parts of the world, as an alternative to carrying a burden on the back, shoulders and so on. People have carried burdens balanced on top of the head since ancient times, usually to do daily work, but sometimes in religious ceremonies or as a feat of skill, such as in certain dances. Thar desert Working Porters for an expedition climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, carrying large loads on their heads along a wide path. Headcarrying in Dakar (2016) Carrying on the head is common in many parts of the developing world, as only a simple length of cloth shaped into a ring or ball is needed to carry loads approaching the person's own weight. The practice is efficient, in a place or at a time when there are no vehicles available for carrying burdens. African-American women continued the practice during the 19th century, which they learned from their elders who had been enslaved from Africa. One observer during the American Civil War noted seeing the impressive sense of balance and dexterity that the practice gave women in South Carolina: \\"I have seen a woman, with a brimming water-pail balanced on her head, or perhaps a cup, saucer, and spoon, stop suddenly, turn round, stoop to pick up a missile, rise again, fling it, light a pipe, and go through many revolutions with either hand or both, without spilling a drop\\". Until the turn of the 20th century, African-American women in the Southern states continued carrying baskets and bundles of folded clothes on top of their heads, when they found work as washerwomen, doing laundry for white employers. This practice ended when the automobile became common in affluent communities, and employers began delivering the clothing to the homes of the washerwomen, rather than the washerwomen walking to the employers' homes. Today, women and men may be seen carrying burdens on top of their heads where there is no less expensive, or more efficient, way of transporting workloads. In India, women carry baskets of bricks to workmen on construction sites. It is also used by the lowest caste to carry away human waste that they scoop out of pit latrines, the practice of manual scavenging. In East Africa, Luo women may carry loads of up to 70% of their own body weight balanced on top of their heads. Women of the Kikuyu tribe carry similar heavy loads, but using a leather strap wrapped around their forehead and the load to secure it while it is carried. (see tumpline) This results in a permanent groove in the forehead of the women. However, there is no evidence of other harmful effects on the health of women who carry heavy loads on top of their heads. Researchers speculate that training from a young age may explain this. Up to 20% of the person's body weight can be carried with no extra exertion of energy. Other researchers have shown that African and European women carrying 70% of their body weight in controlled studies used more oxygen while head-carrying, in contrast to carrying a load on their backs. The research did not support the notion that head-loading is less exerting than carrying on the back, \\"although there is some evidence of energy saving mechanisms for back-loading at low speed/load combinations\\". Women in particular may have practical reasons for carrying on the head, as for many African women it is \\"well-suited to the rough, rural terrain and the particular objects they carry‚Äîlike buckets of water and bundles of firewood\\", then abandoning the practice when they migrate to urban areas where their daily routines, and socially accepted practices, are different. In Ghana, affluent residents of the southern cities employ young women who migrate from the poorer northern region to work as \\"head porters\\", called kayayei, for $2 a day. Dance Spinning dancers balance flaming bowls on their heads, Udaipur, India. There are several traditional dances of West African cultures that include balancing an object on the head as a skillful feat. Ritual dancing among worshippers of the thunder deity, Shango, sometimes balance a container of fire on their heads while dancing. The Egbado Yoruba have dances that include balancing \\"delicate terracotta figures\\" on the head while the arms and torso are moving. This tradition continued among Africans taken to America during the Atlantic slave trade. African-Americans in the 19th century had a popular type of dance competition called \\"set the floor\\" (\\"set de flo'\\"), during which individual dancers would take turns dancing. Competing dancers would try to perform complicated steps given to them by a caller (usually a fiddler), without stepping outside the bounds of a circle drawn on the ground. To add to the challenge, some dancers would compete while balancing a glass full of water on top of their heads, trying not to spill the water while they danced. Comportment During the Victorian era, when finishing schools for young women were at their peak and manners and comportment were more rigid, young women were sometimes instructed to improve their posture by balancing books or a teacup and saucer on their heads while walking and getting up or down from a chair. They were told to model themselves after \\"the Egyptian water-carrier, with the jug of water poised so prettily on her head, and her figure so straight and beautiful\\".

Miyasi Meerawaya was limited to hostelers, however Upali Gunasekara, the newly appointed Principal of Royal College Colombo wished to broaden the scope for every one to perform. As a result, Saga I was organized in 2004 with the leadership of Principal Upali Gunasekara and Music Teacher Ashoka Pushpakumara. The project was joined by the School Development Society of the College which was in the process of developing a fundraising event to help development projects within the school. With it the two projects merged becoming one of the largest national events. Over the years dance and drama were added to the event. Saga V, held in 2009 suffered a major set back as it was cancelled mid-show, in the wake of LTTE air raid on Colombo. Proving to be a defining moment, for the first time in Sri Lanka history an event cancelled due to a public emergency was held again as Saga V Plus to much praise and critical acclaim.
