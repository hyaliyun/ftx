He recorded over forty albums throughout his career and sold over three million records worldwide. Bates also performed on radio stations, CJKL-FM and CKJB. He died of cancer on January 8, 1997 at Bent River in Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. Early life Born on October 16, 1937 in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Canada, Harvey Edgar Bates (known as Smiley) was the youngest of eleven children; he had seven brothers and three sisters. Country music was a prominent feature in the Bates' family life; Bates senior played the fiddle and performed at square dances, where his backing band often included his wife who played piano.\\"The Smiley Bates Story\\" by Adrian Bevis. Published circa 1978 by Heritage Music Sales All of his siblings played musical instruments. As a child, Smiley practiced playing his father's fiddle. Attracted to the guitar after hearing Hank Snow recordings, he began playing on an Eaton's mail-order guitar at age six. Later he also learned to play the banjo, mandolin, and dobro. In 1948, at eleven years of age, Smiley joined Curly Carter and the Mountaineers, playing the fiddle. In 1951, he formed his own band, the North Star Ramblers. Musical career Smiley's band, the North Star Ramblers, consisted of himself on lead guitar, Mike LaPorte on fiddle, and Shep LaPorte on rhythm guitar. The band performed together for about five years, entertaining listeners on radio stations CJKL in Kirkland Lake and CKGB in Timmins. After the LaPorte brothers moved to the Ottawa Valley, Smiley formed a new band featuring Jerry Goselin on rhythm guitar and bass, and Mike Zuppan on accordion. They played straight country and polkas in clubs where they worked on the Quebec circuit. The band stayed together for three years before breaking up. Bates ended up in Oshawa, Ontario, a local centre for country music. There, he connected with Slim Gordon and undertook an Ontario tour which combined club dates and one-night stands at arenas and halls. By this time, country music had grown in popularity, and before television became established in Northern Ontario, there was a lucrative circuit for performers willing to tour from town to town. Slim Gordon decided not to continue touring. Electric guitar player Leroy Glazier, and Rosemary St. John on electric bass, left Slim's band and joined Smiley. Leroy was offered a job in the United States, leading to the dissolution of the band. Smiley then performed in clubs as a single, or as a duo with Hank Beaman on rhythm guitar. =Recording and record deals= In 1966, Smiley recorded his first single. It included The Gal Who Invented Kissing and My Nova Scotia Home, and was issued as a custom pressing. A part-time D.J., who was off his shift at 6 A.M., recorded the songs in Smiley‚Äôs motel room at 7 A.M. Bates met record producer Jack Boswell in 1968. Impressed by Bates' vocal and instrumental talents he signed him to a recording contract. Although Bates arrived at the studio suffering a hangover, he still managed to record three albums in five hours: \\"Golden Guitar\\", \\"5-String Banjo Bluegrass\\", and \\"Fiddler's Dream\\", engineered by the late Bill Bessey, who was known to his fans as \\"Cousin Bill\\" on CBC radio, and later the announcer on the Tommy Hunter TV Show. In 1969, two additional albums were recorded. ‚ÄúSongs from the Heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlat Top Guitar Instrumentals‚Äù showcased Smiley‚Äôs talent and advanced his career. =Revised approach to touring= By 1971, when album sales were increasing, Smiley ceased performing at clubs, opting instead to undertake an annual tour of the Maritimes, in addition to attending annual events like the Shelburne Old Time Fiddle Festival. In 1973, Doug Taylor (Smiley's record producer at the time) asked him to headline an all-Canadian country show in Wheeling, West Virginia, featuring Joe Firth, Bobby Munro, Joanne Post, Steve Smith, and Eastwind. =Commercial success= Smiley's albums caught on, not only in Ontario, but especially in the Maritimes and Newfoundland, and increasing sales brought more recording sessions, with carefully chosen album titles by Smiley himself, a factor that helped boost sales. Titles such as \\"My Mother\\", \\"Songs Of Life\\", \\"Path of Memories\\", \\"True Stories From Life's Other Side\\", and \\"History of Sadness\\", point to the key to Smiley's vocal success - the hurting song. Smiley's commercial success prompted other recording ventures. When the Instrumental hit \\"Duelling Banjos\\" from the film Deliverance was popular, Smiley, on Flat-Top Guitar, was teamed with Eddie Poirier on 5-String Banjo. Though he had not seen the film, it only took a couple of tries to arrive at an arrangement, which, while not representative of Smiley's recording output, was nevertheless a commercial success. A further album was issued with Eddie and Smiley, and based upon its success, the two teamed up with Rose (Eddie's wife) to record another big-selling Bluegrass album, titled The Best of Bluegrass. To illustrate how successful Smiley's recordings were, TeeVee Records, a direct to consumer sales company, put together a package of 20 songs and instrumentals from Smiley's previous albums entitled The Best of Smiley Bates. This album sold in excess of 100,000 units of records and tapes and did particularly well in the Maritimes. Due to the success of the TV record sales Smiley was offered long term recording contracts by three major recording companies. Some of Bates' most successful songs include: \\"Will You Love Me When I'm Old and Feeble\\", \\"Don't Tell Jeannie I'm Blind\\", \\"My Daddy's Eyes\\", \\"I'll Go Get The Toolbox\\", \\"Daddy and the Wine\\", and \\"Let Me In\\" by Gene Chrysler. Probably the most requested was the song \\"Golden Guitar\\" written by Curtis Leach. After the release of the first instrumental album in 1968, more were recorded to meet the demand. Smiley's own instrumental numbers such as \\"Crying Guitar\\", \\"The Last Sunrise\\", \\"Charlie's Boogie\\", \\"Flat Top Chimes\\", and \\"Newfoundland Reel\\" please fans of the Flat Top Guitar. Later years Bates traveled widely playing at festivals and fairs where he met hundreds of fans. \\"Without the people, there wouldn't be me\\", stated Smiley, who enjoyed prioritizing his fanbase and maintaining his knowledge of their favorite songs. He has been called the \\"King of Hurtin' Songs\\". Death Bates continued to record, and to perform for fans during the mid-1990s, until he was diagnosed with cancer. Bates' final live performance was at the Manitoulin Folk Festival. Before he died, Smiley wrote this note of thanks to his many fans: > \\"So Long Folks, I'd like to thank each and everyone of my friends and fans > for sticking with me through my forty-seven years in the music business. > From the hard times in the beginning to the good times at the last, you > followed me down each and every country road. You were part of my music to > the very last note. I want you to know how much I appreciate your loyalty. I > enjoyed playing the music, but having fans and friends... that was my real > reward. I have been a fortunate man. I got to make my living doing what I > loved, and the people seemed to love what I was doing. I feel my life is > complete. Musically Yours Smiley Bates, Bent River, Ontario, Canada. Bates' final three years were spent battling cancer and he eventually died on January 8, 1997, in Bent River, Ontario, Canada.

It has the biggest untapped iron ore deposits of Asia. Summary of Deposits The deposit itself stretches over 32 km and contains 16 separate zones, up to 5 km in length, 380 m wide and extending 550 m down dip, seven of which have been studied in detail. The ore occurs in both primary and oxidized states. The primary ore accounts for 80% of the deposit and consists of magnetite, pyrite and minor chalcopyrite. The remaining 20% is oxidized and consists of three hematitic ore types. The deposit remained unmined in 2006. The presence of coking coal nearby at Shabashak in the Dar-l- Suf District and large iron ore resources made the deposit viable for future development of an Afghan steel industry. Open pit mining and blast furnace smelting operations were envisioned by an early feasibility study.USGS The Hajigak also includes the unusual niobium, a soft metal used in the production of superconducting steel.aol History History reveals that Germans were the first to exploit this deposit systematically after planning a steel mill during or shortly after World War I. But the Great Game prevented this venture. Russians in the 1960s prepared a comprehensive report on the mineral resources of Afghanistan and tried to exploit them but they also failed. When the Kala Bagh steel mill was planned in the late 1960s in Pakistan, it was thought to use some percentage of Hajigak iron ore as the Pakistani mines were not of good quality but this scheme also failed. Geology of Hajigak Afghanistan has a complex geology due to its position on the junction between the Indo-Pakistan and Asian crustal plates. It is composed of a series of terranes that broke away from the main Gondwana super-continent before becoming accreted onto the southern margin of the Eurasian plate. The accretionary events started in the Cretaceous, around 140 million years ago, and have continued until recent times. At some stage in the early Cretaceous there is evidence of a collision of one of these blocks, the Farad block, with the Eurasian plate, along the Herat fault zone. Shortly afterwards, the Helmand block collided with the Farad block. The rocks that host the Hajigak deposit are within the Herat fault zone, and it is likely they were originally part of the Farad and Helmand Blocks. The oldest part of the succession crops out north-west of the Hajigak deposits. It consists of grey silicified limestones and dolomites interbedded with dark grey crystalline schists and light coloured quartzites that display evidence of amphibolite grade metamorphism. The Hajigak iron deposit is hosted by the Upper Proterozoic Awband Formation that, together with the underlying Kab Formation, constitutes the Qala Series, a sequence of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks up to 4500m thick. The Kab Formation consists of dark grey sandy sericitic schists, interpreted as metamorphosed terrigenous rocks, acid volcanic rocks and minor beds of marble and phyllite. The Awband Formation is made up of schists (quartz-sericite, quartzchlorite-sericite, quartz-sericitechlorite and carbonaceoussericite) that are metamorphosed acid and basic tuffites and argillaceous rocks. Minor cherts and marbles also occur. The Green Schist Formation, a distinctive unit overlying the Awband Formation, consists dominantly of green chlorite schists, and quartz-sericitic schists locally intruded by granodiorites. Some reports consider it as a member of the Awband Formation. Upper Devonian rocks of the Hajigak Formation are faulted against the Green Schist Formation. Strata of Lower Cretaceous and younger age crop out in the south west of the area, unconformable on the older sequences. The predominant strike of the Proterozoic and Palaeozoic rocks is between north- east and north-north-east, with a regional dip of approximately 50¬∞ towards the south-southeast or south-east. One major steeply dipping fault juxtaposes the Upper Proterozoic rocks against the crystalline middle Proterozoic rocks. Another throws Upper Devonian rocks against the Upper Proterozoic Green Schist Formation. In addition a suite of north‚Äìsouth and north-west‚Äìsouth-east trending faults, some of them probably thrusts, affect the Upper Proterozoic succession, including the iron ore deposits. The Upper Proterozoic rocks of the Qala Series are interpreted as being deposited in a slowly subsiding marine basin. The initial basin fill was a variable sequence of sandstones and minor volcaniclastic sediments. Later there was an increase in volcanic activity and exhalative iron-rich fluids formed lenses on the sea floor. These sediments were subsequently altered by burial and low-grade (greenschist facies) metamorphism and became the basement of the Helmand Block. This block drifted away from Gondwana supercontinent in the Triassic. During the collision with Eurasia, in the early Cretaceous, faulting juxtaposed the Upper Proterozoic Qala series, the Middle Proterozoic rocks and the Upper Palaeozoic rocks. These fault-bounded blocks are a local characteristic of the Herat fault zone. As the collision progressed, the faulted blocks were folded into a northeast‚Äìsouth-west trending anticline the axis of which passes to the north of the area mapped. A series of thrusts developed as indicated by the increased thickness of the iron ore and its host rocks within the central zone at Hajigak. During the final phase of faulting the north‚Äìsouth and north- west‚Äìsouth-east faults that affect the ore deposits were developed. Later post-Cretaceous extension led to the further development of north- west‚Äìsoutheast faults and graben structures filled with young sediments. Subsequent erosion has exposed the core of the Hajigak anticline with the concordant ore bodies on the southeast limb. Mineralisation The Hajigak deposit trends north-east‚Äìsouth-west for about 9 km and is made up of 16 separate ore bodies, each up to 3 km in length. The deposit can be divided up into three geographical parts, the western, central and eastern parts. In addition to the large ore bodies there is a substantial area of thin fragmental ore deposits in the form of four surficial deposits. The main hematitic ore is medium- to fine-grained and displays a variety of massive, banded and porous textures. It occurs in lenses and sheets, within the Awband Formation. The thickness of the lenses has been indicated by drilling to be up to 100m, while the depth of mineralisation is untested 180m below surface. There are two main ore groups: unoxidised primary ores and semi-oxidised ores. The primary ores occur below 100 m and consist of magnetite and pyrite, and up to 5% chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The oxidised ores, extending up to 130m below ground surface, consist mainly of magnetite, martite and hydrogoethite. Two other oxidised ore types, hydrogoethite/hematite/semi-martite and carbonate/semi-martite, occur sporadically in small amounts in the deposit. Alteration that may be related to the mineralising event has been observed within the host rocks, and includes sericitisation, silicification and carbonisation. Exploration Iron occurrences were observed during initial geological mapping of the area in the mid thirties but the economical potential was not fully recognised until a joint Afghan-Soviet project, between 1963 and 1965, carried out an extensive study which mapped and described the deposit in some detail. The regional geology was mapped at 1:50 000 while the Hajigak deposit was mapped at 1:10 000. Focusing on the western area of the deposit, the study included detailed prospecting, trenching, ore sampling, four deep drillholes, a 200 m long horizontal adit and shafts into the fragmental ore. For two of the main ore bodies, I and II, horizontal plans and vertical crosssections were generated allowing the ore to be resource classified. Development The remote and mountainous location of Hajigak makes it a challenging project for future development. However, the large tonnage and high iron content make it attractive to companies with the proven ability to plan and develop large world-class mines in demanding areas. The deposit remains untested below 180m and there is a potential for ore at greater depth. Additional prospects and mineral occurrences over a 60 km along strike, at Darrah-i-Nil, Khesh, Zerak, Kharkiza, SurkhiParsa, further increase the potential of the area. A feasibility study for the exploitation of the Hajigak deposit was undertaken in 1972 by a Franco-German group, Nenot-Pic. This proposed the construction of a blast furnace, based on the occurrence nearby of coking coal, providing an opportunity for the creation of an integrated iron and steel plant. =Summary of Hajigak deposit= * A world- class iron ore deposit. * Estimated resource of two billion tonnes at approximately 62% Fe. * Sixteen ore bodies extending for up to 3 km and 100m thick. * Amenable to open pitting. * Coal resource nearby suitable for blast furnace/smelting. Award of concessions In November 2011, the Afghan government has awarded four out of the five blocks at Hajigak to a consortium of seven Indian firms led by the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and one block to Canada's Kilo Goldmines.  Indian Government's Hajigak Mining Plan  In May 2016, India, Iran and Afghanistan signed an agreement to develop two berths at Port of Chabahar, build new Chabahar-Zahedan railway as part of North‚ÄìSouth Transport Corridor by linking it with Trans-Iranian Railway, invest up to INR 1 lakh crore (US$14 billion) in the Chabahar Special Economic zone by building gas and urea plant as well as other industries, this will also be linked with Chabahar-Zaranj-Delaram-Hajigak railway: 900 km long Indian-Iranian project, would link future US$10 billion Indian iron-ore mining operations at Hajigak, in Afghanistan to Chabahar, Iran.India-Iran sign key agreements, Published: 23 May 2016 See also * Ashgabat agreement * Turkmenistan‚ÄìAfghanistan‚ÄìPakistan‚ÄìIndia Pipeline * Afghanistan rail network * Rail transport in Afghanistan * Rail transport in Iran * North-South Transport Corridor * Rail transport in Kazakhstan * Rail transport in India * Rail transport in Oman * Rail transport in Tajikistan * Rail transport in Turkmenistan * Rail transport in Uzbekistan References Bamyan Province Maidan Wardak Province Mining in Afghanistan Ore deposits ","title":"Hajigak mining concession"},{"id":"36560829","text":"Qumi (, also Romanized as Q≈´mƒ´) is a village in Pain Velayat Rural District, in the Central District of Taybad County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

Both music and language feature rhythmic and melodic structure. Both employ a finite set of basic elements (such as tones or words) that are combined in ordered ways to create complete musical or lingual ideas. Neuroanotomy of language and music Key areas of the brain are used in both music processing and language processing, such as Brocas area that is devoted to language production and comprehension. Patients with lesions, or damage, in the Brocas area often exhibit poor grammar, slow speech production and poor sentence comprehension. The inferior frontal gyrus, is a gyrus of the frontal lobe that is involved in timing events and reading comprehension, particularly for the comprehension of verbs. The Wernickes area is located on the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and is important for understanding vocabulary and written language. The primary auditory cortex is located on the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. This region is important in music processing and plays an important role in determining the pitch and volume of a sound. Brain damage to this region often results in a loss of the ability to hear any sounds at all. The frontal cortex has been found to be involved in processing melodies and harmonies of music. For example, when a patient is asked to tap out a beat or try to reproduce a tone, this region is very active on fMRI and PET scans. The cerebellum is the \\"mini\\" brain at the rear of the skull. Similar to the frontal cortex, brain imaging studies suggest that the cerebellum is involved in processing melodies and determining tempos. The medial prefrontal cortex along with the primary auditory cortex has also been implicated in tonality, or determining pitch and volume. In addition to the specific regions mentioned above many \\"information switch points\\" are active in language and music processing. These regions are believed to act as transmission routes that conduct information. These neural impulses allow the above regions to communicate and process information correctly. These structures include the thalamus and the basal ganglia. Some of the above- mentioned areas have been shown to be active in both music and language processing through PET and fMRI studies. These areas include the primary motor cortex, the Brocas area, the cerebellum, and the primary auditory cortices. Imaging the brain in action The imaging techniques best suited for studying temporal dynamics provide information in real time. The methods most utilized in this research are functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, and positron emission tomography known as PET scans. Positron emission tomography involves injecting a short-lived radioactive tracer isotope into the blood. When the radioisotope decays, it emits positrons which are detected by the machine sensor. The isotope is chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule, such as glucose, which powers metabolic activity. Whenever brain activity occurs in a given area these molecules are recruited to the area. Once the concentration of the biologically active molecule, and its radioactive \\"dye\\", rises enough, the scanner can detect it. About one second elapses from when brain activity begins to when the activity is detected by the PET device. This is because it takes a certain amount of time for the dye to reach the needed concentrations can be detected. Example of a PET scan. Functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI is a form of the traditional MRI imaging device that allows for brain activity to be observed in real time. An fMRI device works by detecting changes in neural blood flow that is associated with brain activity. fMRI devices use a strong, static magnetic field to align nuclei of atoms within the brain. An additional magnetic field, often called the gradient field, is then applied to elevate the nuclei to a higher energy state. When the gradient field is removed, the nuclei revert to their original state and emit energy. The emitted energy is detected by the fMRI machine and is used to form an image. When neurons become active blood flow to those regions increases. This oxygen-rich blood displaces oxygen depleted blood in these areas. Hemoglobin molecules in the oxygen- carrying red blood cells have different magnetic properties depending on whether it is oxygenated. By focusing the detection on the magnetic disturbances created by hemoglobin, the activity of neurons can be mapped in near real time. Few other techniques allow for researchers to study temporal dynamics in real time. Patient gets a \\"MEG\\". Another important tool for analyzing temporal dynamics is magnetoencephalography, known as MEG. It is used to map brain activity by detecting and recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents generated by neural activity. The device uses a large array of superconducting quantum interface devices, called SQUIDS, to detect magnetic activity. Because the magnetic fields generated by the human brain are so small the entire device must be placed in a specially designed room that is built to shield the device from external magnetic fields. Other research methods Another common method for studying brain activity when processing language and music is transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS. TMS uses induction to create weak electromagnetic currents within the brain by using a rapidly changing magnetic field. The changes depolarize or hyper- polarize neurons. This can produce or inhibit activity in different regions. The effect of the disruptions on function can be used to assess brain interconnections. Recent research Many aspects of language and musical melodies are processed by the same brain areas. In 2006, Brown, Martinez and Parsons found that listening to a melody or a sentence resulted in activation of many of the same areas including the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the Brocas area, anterior insula, the primary audio cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. A 2008 study by Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici found that language impairment may also affect the ability to process music. Children with specific language impairments, or SLIs were not as proficient at matching tones to one another or at keeping tempo with a simple metronome as children with no language disabilities. This highlights the fact that neurological disorders that effect language may also affect musical processing ability. Walsh, Stewart, and Frith in 2001 investigated which regions processed melodies and language by asking subjects to create a melody on a simple keyboard or write a poem. They applied TMS to the location where musical and lingual data. The research found that TMS applied to the left frontal lobe had affected the ability to write or produce language material, while TMS applied to the auditory and Brocas area of the brain most inhibited the research subject‚Äôs ability to play musical melodies. This suggests that some differences exist between music and language creation. Developmental aspects The basic elements of musical and lingual processing appear to be present at birth. For example, a French 2011 study that monitored fetal heartbeats found that past the age of 28 weeks, fetuses respond to changes in musical pitch and tempo. Baseline heart rates were determined by 2 hours of monitoring before any stimulus. Descending and ascending frequencies at different tempos were played near the womb. The study also investigated fetal response to lingual patterns, such as playing a sound clip of different syllables, but found no response to different lingual stimulus. Heart rates increased in response to high pitch loud sounds compared to low pitched soft sounds. This suggests that the basic elements of sound processing, such as discerning pitch, tempo and loudness are present at birth, while later- developed processes discern speech patterns after birth. A 2010 study researched the development of lingual skills in children with speech difficulties. It found that musical stimulation improved the outcome of traditional speech therapy. Children aged 3.5 to 6 years old were separated into two groups. One group heard lyric-free music at each speech therapy session while the other group was given traditional speech therapy. The study found that both phonological capacity and the children‚Äôs ability to understand speech increased faster in the group that was exposed to regular musical stimulation.  Applications in Rehabilitation  Recent studies found that the effect of music in the brain is beneficial to individuals with brain disorders. Stegem√∂ller discusses the underlying principles of music therapy being increased dopamine, neural synchrony and lastly, a clear signal which are important features for normal brain functioning. This combination of effects induces the brain's neuroplasticity which is suggested to increase an individual's potential for learning and adaptation. Existing literature examines the effect of music therapy on those with Parkinson's disease, Huntington's Disease and Dementia among others. = Parkinson's disease = Individuals with Parkinson's disease experience gait and postural disorders caused by decreased dopamine in the brain. One of hallmarks of this disease is shuffling gait, where the individual leans forward while walking and increases his speed progressively, which results in a fall or contact with a wall. Parkinson's patients also have difficulty in changing direction when walking. The principle of increased dopamine in music therapy would therefore ease parkinsonian symptoms. These effects were observed in Ghai's study of various auditory feedback cues wherein patients with Parkinson's disease experience increased walking speed, stride length as well as decreased cadence. = Huntington's disease = Huntington's disease affects a persons movement, cognitive as well as psychiatric functions which severely affects his or her quality of life. Most commonly, patients with Huntington's Disease most commonly experience chorea, lack of impulse control, social withdrawal and apathy. Schwarz et al. conducted a review over the published literature concerning the effects of music and dance therapy to patients with Huntington's disease. The fact that music is able to enhance cognitive and motor abilities for activities other than those of music related ones suggests that music may be beneficial to patients with this disease . Although studies concerning the effects of music on physiologic functions are essentially inconclusive, studies find that music therapy enhances patient participation and long term engagement in therapy which are important in achieving the maximum potential of a patient's abilities. = Dementia = Individuals with Alzeihmer's disease caused by dementia almost always become animated immediately when hearing a familiar song. S√§rk√§mo et al. discusses the effects of music found through a systemic literature review in those with this disease. Experimental studies on music and dementia find that although higher level auditory functions such as melodic contour perception and auditory analysis are diminished in individuals, they retain their basic auditory awareness involving pitch, timbre and rhythm. Interestingly, music-induced emotions and memories were also found to be preserved even in patients suffering from severe dementia. Studies demonstrate beneficial effects of music on agitation, anxiety and social behaviors and interactions. Cognitive tasks are affected by music as well, such as episodic memory and verbal fluency. Experimental studies on singing for individuals in this population enhanced memory storage, verbal working memory, remote episodic memory and executive functions.

Early life Ramachandran was born in Burma of Malayali parents, Alath Krishnan Nair from Mannur in Palakkad District and Chittenippattu Puthenveettil Janaki Amma, from Ottapalam, Kerala, India. After a short period in Burma, CP spent his boyhood in Ottapalam. His education was in Ottapalam and Government Victoria College, Palakkad. After his intermediate schooling he joined the Royal Navy as a mid-ship man. During the Naval Mutiny in 1946, he was under surveillance by the Intelligence Department, as he had a strong Communist Party background prior to his Naval life. After leaving the Navy he worked in the Army for two years in Ahammed Nagar. Finishing his military life, he returned home in 1948, the year after independence, and became very active in the Party once again. All his party works were centred on Ottapalam. When the Party was banned, CP was arrested and sent to Kannur Central Jail. After his release set out to Bombay whilst the police watched him continuously. In 1952 he was called by A. K. Gopalan and immediately started woreking for Goplan's election campaign. Career In 1953, following the instructions of E. M. S. Namboodiripad, CP went to Delhi to join the Party newspaper Crossroads, which later became New Age, and began his career as a journalist. Until 1955 CP was a reporter with the paper. When he had some disagreements with the basic ideas of his Party, he started to write his views in Shankar's Weekly under the name 'Agastya'. Although Namboodiripad warned him, CP was not prepared to compromise, resulting in his expulsion from the Party along with Edathatta Narayan and Aruna Asaf Ali. He then joined Shankar's Weekly as Assistant Editor. His columns, entitled 'Man Of The Week' and 'Free Thinking', were very popular. He met Jalabala Vaidya, then a trainee reporter and now the famous theatre actress, and in 1958 they got married. CP's marriage lasted just six years as they obtained a mutual divorce in 1964, after fathering two children Jai and Anasuya. In 1960 CP joined The Hindustan Times as Parliament Correspondent. His column 'Last Week in Parliament' was much discussed. When B G Vargeese was fired from the paper in 1974, CP filed a suit against Birla who was the owner of the newspaper. It became a notable chapter in the history of Indian Journalism. In 1986 CP retired from Hindustan Times as Deputy Editor. Death He never wished to remain in Delhi, where he had lived most of his life as an intellectual and a journalist, so went back to his mother in Parali, Palakkad, and was with her when she died. CP lived his last 11 years in Parli, until he died on 15 April 1997.

They were close to the small town of Lake Victor and seven or eight miles away from Burnet, Texas. Sage Sage is located on the north fork of the San Gabriel River where the old Austin-San Saba Road and the old Burnet-Lampasas Road cross. Many believe the name Sage comes from the large amount of sage grass that is located there. The first people came to Sage before the 1860s and consisted of A.N. Murphy, J.A. Murphy, Hugh McCoy, Alfred Shelby. Other families came to the area in later years and consisted of Andy Fields, George Newt Jones (and family), the Harkriders, Pates, Bentons, Hodges, Hahns, Purcells, Everetts, Pipers, and many other families. These families were primarily from Mississippi, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Many people from Sage were veterans of The Civil War and both World Wars. =General store= In 1890 George Newt Jones built the general store that was on the land owned by the Murphys. Jones was the storekeeper and went to Lampasas twice a month to get supplies. Some supplies included pickles, vinegar, candy, flour, corn meal, sugar, green coffee and every once in a while apples and oranges (every thing came in sacks or barrels). Mark Baily was the last storekeeper when the store closed in 1918. The store joined the Feild land and created a picnic ground and every year they held a barbecue on the Fourth of July that would sometimes last for more than a day there was games, a swimming hole and even candidates would speak. And in the winter they would put up a tent and entertain the residents. The old store building still stands today. =Other businesses= Hugh M. Murphy built the first Sage gin and then after many years of wear and tear Hugh Murphy's son, Herb, made a new gin in 1900 which operated until 1929. Ira Feild was the last operator of the gin (1924‚Äì1929). The only other operators of the gin was Jim Everett and his family. Sage established a post office on November 17, 1874 which had Jesse G.W. Howard as Post Master but was discontinued from 1884-1898 (during which time the people of sage got their mail from Sunny Lane). The post office then reopened and ultimately closed in 1906 when the mail was redirected to Burnet. In 1884 Sage had three churches, and a steam corn mill. There was no school or cemetery in Sage so the residents sent their children to school in either nearby Bethel or Pleasant Hill and also buried their dead in the same locations. =Stage stop= For many years Sage was a stop on the stage route between Burnet and Lampasas. The stage route ran from Lampasas to Burnet Twice a week for many years until travel to and from Lampasas and Burnet became higher in demand. Then the stage ran everyday both ways. =Growth and decline= In 1884 Sage had 75 residents, and in 1900 Sage had 242 residents at its highest population total. Sage began to decline after the small town was bypassed by the Houston and Central Texas railway in 1903 and by 1940 only a few scattered houses marked the place where sage once stood and by the 1980s there was nothing but the old city limit sign and general store building to mark the once prominent town. Bethel Bethel was a small sister town to Sage and used Sage' gin, store, and post office but Bethel had a church, cemetery, community center and school. Bethel is around eight miles northeast of Burnet on R.R. 963 and on county road 202. The name Bethel comes from the biblical village of Bethel. The people of Bethel were mostly from Kentucky, South Carolina, and Mississippi, like Sage. =School= The Bethel school was established in 1869 with John T. Chamberlain as the teacher even though there was no land given to the school until 1874 and on July 11, 1874 A.R. Johnson and T.E. Hammond deeded 3 acres to Thomas Glimp and Jesse G.W. Howard for the Bethel school (Volume I, Page 320, DRBC) and they gave 3 more acres to Thomas Glimp, C.H. Hahn, and Jesse G.W. Howard for the school(Volume I, Page 456, DRBC). The school had one teacher and 25 students in the 1890s and closed in 1941 with John L. Chamberlain and Ruth Fluitt. =Growth and decline= Just like Sage, Bethel declined after Sage was bypassed by the Houston and Central Texas Railway but it did not decline quite as fast as Sage. Several houses and the cemetery marked Bethel in the 1940s. Scattered houses, a community center, and the cemetery marked Bethel in 1990. And today only a few houses, the cemetery, and historical marker what used to be the town of Bethel. =Historical marker= The historical marker reads Pleasant Hill Pleasant Hill was a small community located about nine miles Northeast of Burnet on Farm to Market 2340 between Bethel and Lake Victor and was closely linked to Sage and Bethel but also Lake Victor. Pleasant Hill had its own school and cemetery. The people in Pleasant Hill were, like Sage and Bethel, mostly from Kentucky, Mississippi, and South Carolina. =School= The School at Pleasant Hill was a two-room structure built in 1884 and was deeded along with 5 acres on October 14, 1885 to School District #2 by William Hodge and T.J. Stewart. The school was then given to the Lake Victor and Bethel school districts in 1905 because of overcrowding in those communities schools. This school was called 'Pleasant Vieiw'. =Growth and decline= Pleasant Hill also started to decline under the same lines as Sage and Bethel. All that marked Pleasant Hill in the 1990s was the cemetery and scattered houses. Now the old grounds of Pleasant Hill are only marked by the cemetery and a couple houses.

Fishing from Fleetwood. Early World War II On the 18 Sept 1939, just after the start of WW2, the Alvis was fishing in the vicinity of St Kilda. At about 1.20pm a shot was heard and a large spout of water erupted close to the Alvis. The skipper and crew then spotted a German submarine. The skipper, Albert Thomason, was signalled from the U Boat and instructed to abandon his vessel. The small lifeboat was launched and the crew left the Alvis. The lifeboat pulled alongside the submarine, the U-35, and the commander, Werner Lott, asked for the captain of the Alvis. Thomason went aboard the submarine and, on the conning tower, Lott extended his hand in welcome. He then said, \\" I am sorry but I will have to sink your ship\\" and asked Skipper Thomason if there were anymore crew aboard the Alvis. The crew and Lott, all speaking very good English, handed cigarettes to the Alvis crew, and then ordered them back to their vessel. Lott sent a working party over to Alvis under the command of a Lieutenant. On their arrival, they threw the wireless overboard and then chopped away the fishing gear and smashed the dynamo in the engine room. The Lieutenant asked Thomason if he could take a lifebelt as a souvenir, which he did. However, Lott gave Thomason a bottle of gin in return with his compliments. No provisions or the fish caught were taken from the Alvis by the Germans. The reason the U-Boat commander did not sink the Alvis was that, in his opinion, the 13-man crew would never make it back to shore in their lifeboat. The Alvis returned unharmed to her homeport of Fleetwood, but that same day the U-Boat commander found 3 other Fleetwood vessels. They were the Arlita, the Lord Minto, and the Nancy Hague. After removing the crews from the Arlita and Lord Minto onto the Nancy Hague, the U-35 sank the two empty ships. The three crews returned to Fleetwood aboard the Nancy Hague. The Alvis was subsequently requisitioned in 1940 by the Admiralty. Werner Lott was taken prisoner of war aboard HMS Kingston, with all of his crew, after he scuttled his U-boat on 29 November 1939. =U-35's Account of Events= The fishing trawler Alvis was the first British ship U-35 encountered in the North Atlantic. She allowed Alvis to pass unharmed on 18 September 1939, after realising that the thirteen man crew could never have reached land in the available lifeboat. In return, the British captain warned U-35 that the Royal Navy aircraft carrier Ark Royal was in the general area. The following details were extracted from U-35\`s war diary: * Name and size of the vessel: \\"St. Alvis\\", 271 Br T * Name of owner: unknown * Port of registry: Hull * Port of departure : Fleetwood * Destination port: Fleetwood * Flag visible: none \\"The steamer is of enemy origin. He should be destroyed, because confiscation is not possible. His operation area was far away from the coast and because of that he could not be considered a \\"coastal fishery vessel\\". The fish catching equipment and the radio were thrown overboard. The crew of 13 which had already embarked into the rescue boat was advised to get back onto the ship, because the freeboard of it was already very narrow and was not considered seaworthy. The steamer was dismissed. There were no attempts to escape or other resistance.\\" =Crew on 18 Sep 1939= Name, Initial, Age and Job Title * THOMASON - ALBERT - E - 38 (Skipper ) * BROOKES - C - 24 ( Second Hand ) * JENKINS - JOHN - 36 ( Third Hand ) * KERR - R - 40 ( Engineer ) * GUNNI - ABDUL - 38 ( Second Engineer ) * SOUTHERN - W - 17 ( Deck Hand ) * PURCELL - P - 22 ( Fireman / Trimmer ) * RADMORE - J - 23 ( Deck Hand ) * SANDHAM - J - 30 ( Fireman / Trimmer ) * WILSON - R - 24 ( Deck Hand ) * JONES - P - 51 ( Deck Hand ) * DAY - A - 18 ( Deck Hand ) * GRIFFITHS - C - 36 ( Cook ) Naval Service Alvis was requisitioned for war service as an anti submarine trawler, on 30 Apr 1940.

Alvis was fitted out as a minesweeper in May 1941, and from January 1942 she was based at Hartlepool with M/S Group 148. She took part in the minesweeping operations that were vital to the success and safety of the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944: Fate Alvis was returned to civilian service just before the end of the war in Europe in Mar 1945.

She was involved in several programs in Penn State‚Äôs College of Engineering, including the Graduate Program in Acoustics, the Materials Research Institute, and the Penn State Diabetes Center. She was promoted to full Professor in 2010. Her research concentrated on ultrasound for cancer treatment and noninvasive drug delivery. She published more than fifty papers in both areas (see Works, below). She collaborated with Focus Surgery, Inc., the makers of the Sonoblate¬Æ500 and with Piezo Resonance Innovations (now Actuated Medical, Inc.) on SBIR funding from the National Institutes of Health. Smith‚Äôs work has also been publicized in the popular press both nationally and internationally with her research in needleless insulin delivery and glucose sensing for diabetes. In 2009/2010 she spent a sabbatical year at the Leiden University Medical Center where she was involved in several projects involving high field human magnetic resonance imaging. In addition to teaching medical imaging and medical instrumentation classes, Smith designed and developed the capstone Senior Design course for the Bioengineering curriculum at Penn State. In 2009, Smith was commissioned by Cambridge University Press to co-author an engineering textbook entitled, \\"Introduction to Medical Imaging: Physics, Engineering and Clinical Applications\\", which was published in 2011. Smith was the Co-Chair of the International Association of Science and Technology for Development Signal and Image Processing conference in 2009, the course program co-organizer on RF Coil Design for the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology, a member of the Scientific & Technical Program Committee and Student Research Competition (Chair) for the International Society of Therapeutic Ultrasound conference, and an Associate Editor for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectronics, and Frequency Control.

He was considered to be one of the foremost moving target shooters in the world. Early life and education Billy G. Hicks was born in Echols, Kentucky on May 29, 1927. He grew up poor living in rural western Kentucky with his mother and father, brother and two sisters. His father earned a meager living through the 1930s as an electrician for the Louisville Gas and Electric company. Billy was a victim of Polio in his early childhood years but later recovered having only a slight difference in his stance, with his left leg being shorter than the right. He attributed his success in shooting later in his professional career with his early hunting trips as a boy with his father, shooting quail in Central City Kentucky. Hicks was extremely proficient with not only the pistol and rifle but was also deadly accurate with hitting moving targets. Early jobs prior to his military and shooting careers included working part-time for the local mining company in Central City Kentucky, working above the mines and in them. Other early jobs included working for a pharmacy and delivering milk. It was his proficiency with firearms that would end up taking him farther than he ever dreamed possible. Military career Hicks' military career started in 1945 when he was drafted into service as a U.S. Marine. He served with the Marine 6th Division in Sing Tau China until the end of World War II. After the war he returned to Kentucky and his home town for a brief period of time. He was drafted again for service when the Korean War broke out and decided to stay in the Marines. Not long after the Korean War ended, his shooting career began. Hicks began shooting Trap and Skeet in 1955 while stationed in Hawaii, and achieved his AA (Master Class) rating the same year which was almost unheard of. He quickly began moving up the ranks entering into shooting competitions and by 1963 he had achieved over 48 career wins. While stationed in California working as a U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructor, Billy competed across the state in shooting competitions often against hundreds of other shooters, and began making headlines in Southern California news papers. He entered into large professional competitions sometimes going up against movie stars like Roy Rogers and Robert Stack. It was not unusual for him to enter into a Trap or Skeet competition against 150 or more shooters, and come out with top honors. By 1965 he felt there was nothing more for him to achieve in the amateur competitions and began training on Olympic Trap and Skeet ranges, where there are 12 traps and targets travel at 90+ miles an hour. He wanted to earn a spot on the United States International Team. Billy earned the praises of the Commandant of the Marine Corps for his consistent display of shooting prowess, and he soon caught the attention of the International Shooting Team thereafter. Billy along with a select other few were invited to participate in team trials. He had to prove to them that he could shoot consistently and with the same accuracy in order to earn a spot on the 4 man team. He traveled to Quantico Virginia to try out for the U.S. team, and destroyed 195x200 targets during his first Olympic Trap trial. In Fredericksburg on the second test - he knocked down 99x100. The third and final test came at the 27th annual North- South Championships in Washington DC. Bill was now part of a \\"trial\\" international team of five and together they disintegrated 542x550 birds and won every contest. The local paper headline the next day read ‚ÄúHicks was picking off skeet like John Wayne picks off Indians during a wagon train attack. He busted 95x100..to capture the first place honors.‚Äù The final 4 man international team was then picked, and Billy had earned his place on the prestigious team. As a member of the United States World Championship Trap and Skeet Team in 1966 Hicks' hit ratio on moving targets was 98.8%, and he was considered to be one of the United States Marine Corps' best Olympic clay target shooters. In a competition where the shooter has a little less than 3 seconds to fire and hit Hicks had proven that he could perform consistently under pressure. In 1966, the US team won the gold and top honors at the Olympic Trap World Championships in Wiesbaden, Germany. The team consisted of Billy G. Hicks, Gordon Horner, Charles Jenson, and Ken Jones. Hicks' shot down 288x300 targets in this event. He was awarded the highest military badge for any American shooter, the U.S. International Distinguished Shooter Badge (his number is #100). In 1967, Hicks again joined the United States Team at Bologna Italy with James Beck, Chris Bishop, and Richard Loffelmacher. The US Team won the silver and bronze that year, with Hicks registering a score of 274x300. In late 1968 his shooting career was put on hold when he received orders to Vietnam. Hicks reported to H&MS; 39 in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province for combat support operations. While there he was instrumental in the realignment of the H&MS-39; provisional organizational structure by recommending delineations of responsibility and assignments of specific tasks, thereby promoting more effective operations. He directed a concentrated effort to enhance the morale and welfare of the squadron. Despite the constant pulse of combat support operations, 1stSgt Hicks in his spare time supervised the layout and construction of the Provisional Marine Air Group 39 Skeet Range which was the only one of its kind in Northern I Corps. It opened for operation in March 1969. In his spare time he continued to manage the range for six months to promote off-duty recreational activity. National Records On May 19, 1968 Billy G. Hicks became the first American to ever fire a perfect 200 x 200 straight in Olympic trap at the Preliminary Olympic International Clay Pigeon Competition in Thurmont, Maryland. On September 7th, 1970 he was awarded an NRA certificate in recognition of a National Record (co-holder open and co- holder service records) in a clay pigeon 300 target event, with a score of 294x300 straight at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Later life and death At the end of the 1960s and his military shooting career, Hicks held multiple gold, silver, and bronze medals in International Shooting awarded at both the Wiesbaden and Bologna ISSF events. He held a National Record 200x200 straight in Olympic Trap, and was the co-holder of a second National Trap Record of 294x300 straight. He had been awarded the highest achievement medal in shooting the International Distinguished Shooters Badge In 1971 Hicks retired from the U.S. Marine Corps, and began a second career as a shooting instructor at Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. He continued to compete in the ATA circuit periodically to keep his skills sharp. He was awarded the South Eastern States Clay Pigeon Championship - NRA Civilian Champion Award in 1972. In 1981 not being one to sit on the sidelines - Hicks entered himself in professional competition once again at the Live Bird World Championships in Guadalajara, Mexico against 600 of the best moving target shooters from all over the world in a \\"miss and out\\" competition, you miss once and you're out of the competition. In just three days, all 600 shooters had been eliminated except for Billy G. Hicks (United States), Carlo Giogretti (Italy), and Butch Riechoff (United States). Riechoff missed his 53rd bird, and left Hicks and Giogretti competing for the World Championship. Hicks missed his 54th bird placing second in the World Competition. He returned to Rolling Rock Club and opened a children's shooting program to perpetuate the sport, where he taught hundreds of young men and women ages 12-18 how to shoot Skeet and Trap until his retirement. This was something that was very close to his heart and he enjoyed very much. During his career as a professional shooting instructor he designed and built many shooting facilities both at Rolling Rock Club and for other private enterprises, including Duck Towers, Quail Walks, Live Bird Ranges, and culminating with a full size Olympic Trap Range for Rolling Rock Club as his parting gift. Hicks retired from Trap and Skeet shooting in 1988 and moved to Spring Hill Florida where he spent many happy years with his family and his wife of 64 years Barbara Jean. When asked how he got to be one of the best moving target shooters in the world he replied - \\"I just kept practicing until I mastered it.\\". Billy died on October 7th, 2016 from complications due to congestive heart failure. = Affiliations and awards = 1964 National Rifle Association of America, International Skeet - Distinguished Expert Certification 1966 Member- United States World Championship Trap and Skeet Team 1966 ISSF World Shooting Championships [Wiesbaden, Germany) - Gold Medal / Silver Medal / Bronze Medal (288x300) 1966 Military All-American Skeet Team Sports Afield 1966 National Rifle Association of America - Shotgun Distinguished Expert Certification 1966 International Distinguished Shooters Badge #100 [awarded] 1967 Member- United States World Championship Trap and Skeet Team 1967 ISSF World Shooting Championships [Bologna, Italy] - Silver Medal / Bronze Medal (274x300) 1968 (NRA) National Record Holder [a first National Record] - Olympic International Clay Pigeon Competition (200x200) Perfect Score - Thurmont, Maryland [May 19th 1968] 1968 National Rifle Association of America - Master Classification for NRA International Clay Pigeon Competition - Certified Lifetime Master 1968 All- State Skeet Team Virginia 1969 All-State Skeet Team Virginia 1970 NSSA World Champion 1970 (NRA) National Record Holder [Co-Holder] - Clay Pigeon 300 Target (Score 294) - Inter Service Clay Pigeon Tournament, Fort Benning, Georgia [September 7-11, 1970] 1971 All-State Skeet Team Virginia 1981 - World Champion Live Moving Target Championship Guadalajara Mexico [U.S. Grand Prix March 2nd 1981] References 1927 births American male sport shooters United States Distinguished Marksman Trap and double trap shooters 2016 deaths ","title":"Billy Hicks"},{"id":"36561043","text":"Derenik-Ashot Artsruni (, died 958/959) was the second King of Vaspurakan, from the Artsruni dynasty, succeeding his father, Gagik I, on the latter's death.

This was the first weapon made in North Korea alongside the PPSh-41, made under license as the Type 49.https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/rifles/north-korean-ak-rifles/ It was made in Factory 61 and 65 in Chongjin. History After the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953), DPRK was allied with the Soviet Union and continued to receive military support from them throughout the Cold War.https://www.forgottenweapons.com/north-korean-type-58-milled-ak/ President Kim Il-sung ordered the fabrication of the Type 58. The assault rifle was first produced in 1958. These were made initially with Russian components until the North Koreans were able to make the parts on their own. Before production of the Type 58 ceased, it's reported that around 800,000 were made.http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/north-korean-small-arms/3/ North Korea eventually turned production towards the Type 68 since it was getting too much time consuming to make the Type 58 even though the cost of labor to make the assault rifle is not a problem. Production eventually was halted in 1968 and shifted to the Type 68 in the same year. The Type 58 was exported to Cuba and Vietnam in the 1960s before it showed up in parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. The Type 68 was reported to be exported to the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front covertly in the 1980s. Design =Type 58= While the Type 58 is based on the AK-47 with the milled receiver, the difference between the two assault rifles is that the former has identifying marks such as the five-point star in a circle and Type 58 in hangul. The Type 58 has a firing rate at 600-650 RPM. The Type 58's quality of finish bluing depends, which usually ranges from average to poor. Initial production models were not made with bayonet lugs. Later models were produced with said bayonet lugs. =Type 68= The Type 68 was made with features from the Type 58 with features such as the solid catalpa wood stock, wood pistol grip, handguards and smooth sheet-steel top covers. It has a swivel retaining bracket spot- welded on the left side of the receiver. The pistol grip stud and lower stock tang are riveted in place. The milled gas block is flat on both sides and, like the Type 58, has a sling swivel that extends outward from the left side. The folding stock variant of the Type 68 has the Soviet underfolding design with stamped steel struts and buttplate. The rear sights are graduated to a distance of 800 meters. The trigger group is not based on the Soviet AKM. Instead, the trigger is a double-hook design based on milled receiver-based AKs. The rifle has a barrel length of 415 mm with a velocity of 715 m/s.http://www.military-today.com/firearms/type_68.htm Its rate of fire is at 40-100 RPM. While it has a sight range of 800 meters, its effective range is at 300 to 400 meters. While Type 68s used hangul markings in the fire selectors, exported versions uses non-hangul markings with 1 for semi-auto and an infinity symbol for automatic fire. The markings consist of a five-point star in a circle and Type 68 in hangul. Variants =Type 58-1= A variant of the Type 58 with a folding stock. =Type 68= The Type 68 is a North Korean version of the AKM, it was adopted in 1968 to replace the Type 58. It has no rate reducer. It has its own bayonet, which is based on the AK-47 bayonet, but it has a different pommel mount for it.http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/North_Korea/north_korea_2.html These bayonets were also issued in Cuba, which have green scabbards instead of tan scabbards, which is used the Korean People's Army.http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/Cuba/cuba_2.html =Type 68-1= The Type 68-1 features a underfolding stock like the AKMS with holes in it to help reduce overall weight.

You can serve an individual quite well; you can deliver excellent customer service if you wait for someone to walk through the door and then you go and pull their chart. What you can't do with paper charts is ask the question, 'Who didn't walk in the door?'\\"ONC Chief: Meaningful Use of Meaningful Use Measures , July 23, 2012  Implementation and effects  In the years since the law was passed, electronic health records in the United States have become more common, but it's unclear how much this was caused by the law. The meaningful use incentives in the law only applied to certain types of hospitals, however, and a 2017 study suggests that these hospitals did adopt electronic health records more aggressively. Subtitle A ‚Äì Promotion of Health Information Technology =Part 1 ‚Äì Improving Health Care Quality, Safety, and Efficiency= Electronic health records (EHR) The HITECH Act set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption. The \\"goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs‚Äîthat is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care.\\" Title IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for Medicaid to those who adopt and use \\"certified EHRs\\" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare, the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH act (ARRA) requires doctors to show \\"meaningful use\\" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there are no penalty provisions for Medicaid.Habib JL. EHRs, meaningful use, and a model EMR. Drug Benefit Trends. May 2010;22(4):99-101. Health information exchange (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve \\"meaningful use\\" and receive stimulus funding. Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.Pear, Robert. \\"Warnings Over Privacy of U.S. Health Network.\\" New York Times, February 18, 2007. =Meaningful use= The main components of meaningful use are: * The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing. * The use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to improve quality of health care. * The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures. In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity. The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows: * Improve care coordination * Reduce healthcare disparities * Engage patients and their families * Improve population and public health * Ensure adequate privacy and security The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records: * Incentives: to providers who use IT * Strict and open standards: To ensure users and sellers of EHRs work towards the same goal * Certification of software: To provide assurance that the EHRs meet basic quality, safety, and efficiency standards The detailed definition of \\"meaningful use\\" was rolled out in 3 stages. Details of each stage were hotly debated by various groups. Stage 1 was finalized in July 2010, Stage 2 in August 2012, and Stage 3 in October 2015 =Meaningful use Stage 1= The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified EHR and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.See subsection (e), Full list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements. Core Requirements: # Use computerized order entry for medication orders. # Implement drug-drug, drug-allergy checks. # Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically. # Record demographics. # Maintain an up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses. # Maintain active medication list. # Maintain active medication allergy list. # Record and chart changes in vital signs. # Record smoking status for patients 13 years old or older. # Implement one clinical decision support rule. # Report ambulatory quality measures to CMS or the States. # Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request. # Provide clinical summaries to patients for each office visit. # Capability to exchange key clinical information electronically among providers and patient authorized entities. # Protect electronic health information (privacy & security) Menu Requirements: # Implement drug-formulary checks. # Incorporate clinical lab-test results into certified EHR as structured data. # Generate lists of patients by specific conditions to use for quality improvement, reduction of disparities, research, and outreach. # Send reminders to patients per patient preference for preventive/ follow-up care # Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information (including lab results, problem list, medication lists, allergies) # Use certified EHR to identify patient-specific education resources and provide to patient if appropriate. # Perform medication reconciliation as relevant # Provide summary care record for transitions in care or referrals. # Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registries and actual submission. # Capability to provide electronic syndromic surveillance data to public health agencies and actual transmission. To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to \\"attest\\" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system. In 2017, the government for the first time charged an EHR vendor with falsely representing to customers and the government that its EHR system met the requirements for meaningful use. eClinicalWorks agreed to pay $155 million to settle government charges and a \\"qui tam\\" lawsuit brought by a whistleblower who implemented eClinicalWorks' system at Rikers Island Correctional Facility in New York City. The government also alleged that ECW paid kickbacks for referrals. The government also reached separate settlement agreements with three eClinicalWorks employees who will pay a total of $80,000 to the government to settle civil allegations. National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (HIT) There is established within the Department of Health and Human Services an Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).

This subtitle extends the complete Privacy and Security Provisions of HIPAA to the business associates of covered entities.42 U.S.C. ¬ß17931 This includes the extension of updated civil and criminal penalties to the pertinent business associates. These changes are also required to be included in any business-associate agreements among the covered entities. On November 30, 2009, the regulations associated with the enhancements to HIPAA enforcement took effect.HHS Strengthens HIPAA Enforcement Another significant change brought about in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act is the new breach notification requirements. This imposes new notification requirements on covered entities, business associates, vendors of personal health records (PHR) and related entities if a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI) occurs. On April 27, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued guidance on how to secure protected health information appropriately.Guide to Privacy and Security of Electronic Health Information Both HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) were required under the HITECH Act to issue regulations associated with the new breach notification requirements. The HHS rule was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2009,Health and Human Services Breach Notification Rule and the FTC rule was published on August 25, 2009.Federal Trade Commission Breach Notification Rule The final significant change made in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act implements new rules for the accounting of disclosures of a patient's health information. It extends the current accounting for disclosure requirements to information that is used to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations when an organization is using an electronic health record (EHR). This new requirement also limits the timeframe for the accounting to three years instead of six as it currently stands. These changes took effect January 1, 2011, for organizations implementing EHRs between January 1, 2009 and January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2013, for organizations who had implemented an EHR prior to January 1, 2009. Subtitle D also includes a \\"third-party directive\\" stating that individuals have the right to obtain a copy of their health information in an electronic format and, if the individual chooses, to direct the covered entity to transmit such copy directly to an entity or person designated by the individual. Although HHS had interpreted the statutory cap on the provision of medical records to an individual to apply to medical records delivered under the third-party directive, a recent decision by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia voided that regulation on the grounds that it had not gone through notice and comment. What is The Effect of Ciox Health v. Azar on HiTECH letters On July 14, 2010, HHS issued a rule that listed categories that included 701,325 entities and 1.5 million business associates who would have access to patient information without patient consent after the patient had given general consent to their medical practitioner's HIPAA release.Federal Register Document 2010-16718 tables under paragraphs 75 FR 40911 334, 376.Health Freedom Watch Newsletter September 2010, Proposed Changes to Privacy Rule Won't Ensure Privacy See also * Omnibus Rule * Common rule References Further reading * External links * Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, January 16, 2009 * Data Breaches Affecting 500 or More Individuals * How Interface Terminology Makes Standardized Health Information Possible, Journal of AHIMA 83, no.7 (July 2012): 30‚Äì35.

It is developed and maintained by CIDCO. It is located in Raigad district. It is soon going to come under the purview of the Panvel Municipal Corporation. Ulwe has a sports complex with football, badminton, hockey, swimming pool and indoor stadium. Ulwe has seen drastic increase in property rate due to the geographical location and proximity of the under- construcction Navi Mumbai International Airport, Seawoods-Uran railway line and a proposed trans harbor link from Sewri to Chirle village. Ulwe has big land parcels belonging to Reliance Industries Ltd. on which big residential and commercial activities are expected to start. The nearest railway station is the Bamandongri railway station, named after the village settlement located in the node. Many buildings and constructions are being developed in Ulwe. CIDCO buildings are also being constructed in there. The Navi Mumbai international airport is nearby to Ulwe. A sea link from Sewri to Nhava Sheva is proposed. Coastal road is also proposed which will act as a connector between sea link and new NMIA (Navi Mumbai International Airport) and another arm of coastal road will connect sea link to JNPT. The Sea link will have interchange at Shivajinagar, ulwe and it will be extended up to Chirle nearby Dronagiri node. Ulwe Port Ulwe is situated at the Panvel creek and is at a distance of 6 miles from Panvel. There is a wharf at Ulwe. The old pier is in a dilapidated condition. This port is not approachable to big steamers. There are two seasonal sailing vessels for passenger traffic. Mostly these vessels are used for carrying vegetables and fruits to Mumbai. The chief goods exported from Ulwe are fruits and vegetables, rice, grain, salt, firewood and sand. Modern History City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) a registered company under the company's act of 1972 and is responsible for development of the Ulwe node and all the other nodes in Navi Mumbai. The other nodes in Navi Mumbai are Vashi, Sanpada, Nerul, Seawoods, Kamothe, Kharghar, Panvel, Turbhe, Airoli, Dronagiri and Ulwe. Originally land parcels were owned by farmers in this node. CIDCO brought land from farmers and has been developing these land parcels. The Ulwe node has a river (Ulwe river) passing through the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport. To the north east of the node lies the Gahdi river. The node also has more than 300 hectares of mangroves. Environmental Context The nodes in the environmental perspective are very rich, with 300+ hectares of mangroves and two rivers. Rivers Ulwe and Ghadi pass through the Ulwe node in the proposed international airport area. Construction and development has only been possible after containing, diverting these rivers and mangroves. Approximately 200 hectares of mangroves will be destroyed for the upcoming international airport. The environmental clearance for the project has been given based on relocation or re plantation of these 200 hectare mangroves. Cidco has proposed a mangrove park north of the airport site. The river Ghadi is to be diverted altering its meeting point in the Panvel creek. Environmentalist fear flooding of Panvel area because of this alteration. Karnala bird sanctuary is just below the Dronagiri node, south east of the node. The bird sanctuary is small, approximately 11.2 km. square. Along with Sanjay Gandhi national park and Tungerashwar sanctuary is the boundary of Mumbai Metropolitan region. Dronagiri fort is located in the southernmost tip of Dronagiri spread over an area of 17 km. square and is bound by karnjha river on the south-east. It lies between the town of Uran and karanjha.

Another term often used for management accounting principles for these purposes is managerial costing principles. The two management accounting principles are: # Principle of Causality (i.e., the need for cause and effect insights) and, # Principle of Analogy (i.e., the application of causal insights by management in their activities). These two principles serve the management accounting community and its customers ‚Äì the management of businesses. The above principles are incorporated into the Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF) along with concepts and constraints to help govern the management accounting practice. The framework ends decades of confusion surrounding management accounting approaches, tools and techniques and their capabilities. The framework of principles, concepts, and constraints will drive the classification of management accounting practices in the profession to \\"enable a better understanding both inside the profession and outside, of the compromises that result from inappropriate principles\\". Without foundational principles, managers and accounting professionals have no consistent footing on which to challenge or evaluate new theories of methods for managerial costing. Some management accounting methods are designed primarily to serve and comply with financial accountancy guidelines. The importance of having distinct and separate principles exclusively for Management Accounting has received support and acknowledgement after almost a century of work on the topic. The idea that separate management accounting principles exist for managerial decision support distinct from financial reporting needs is now recognized by professional accounting bodies such as the International Federation of Accountants Professional Accountants In Business Committee and the Institute of Management Accountants Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework (MCCF) Task Force. Brief History Prior to 1929 no group ‚Äì public or private ‚Äì was issuing or responsible for any accounting standards. After the 1929 stock market crash, a call to regain the public's confidence and investor's trust was demanded and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 was passed resulting in public companies being supervised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This set the groundwork for GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States), outlining financial accounting principles for external reporting standards for users of financial statements' information such as capital markets and creditors. Over the next 47 years many individual committees, professional bodies and boards released various financial accounting procedural frameworks until 1976 when work began on a US framework that remains in place today, governed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Note: Since April 1, 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board has been working on developing new international financial reporting standards. The new standards, referred to as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), aim to update and refine existing concepts and provide descriptive guidance that includes comparisons of reporting requirements between IFRS and U.S. GAAP. As a result of establishing International Financial Reporting Standards, the IASB and FASB Conceptual Frameworks and Standards are in the process of being updated and converged to reflect the changes in markets, business practices and the economic environment that have occurred in the two or more decades since the concepts were first developed. One of the foundations of a set of Financial Accounting Standards is the creation of a Conceptual Framework that defines the principles upon which the standards will be based. Most major national and international accounting standards have developed conceptual frameworks to support their work on setting standards. In contrast, management accounting principles have been overlooked from both a conceptual and a standards point of view and, for the most part, overshadowed by financial accounting standards. Generally accepted accounting principles applies strictly to financial accounting because it was either the only guidance they had at the time, or did not know what else to do. Until recently, no serious work has been done by the accounting profession on the conceptual differences between the use of management accounting techniques to support GAAP financial reporting and management accounting techniques used for internal decision support. This greatly compromises the management accounting practice and the ability of management accountants to provide managers with relevant decision support and optimization information. Yet, several innovative thinkers, shown in the Timeline below, saw value in management accounting having its own distinct set of principles. Over the last century it is more and more evident that management accounting principles be viewed as \\"indispensable to the evaluation and improvement of MA methods and practices\\" (Clinton, Van der Merwe 2012). Historical timeline :1910 ‚Äì Church. The History of Accounting. The management accounting practice was originally discussed in a series of articles published in The Engineering Magazine. As was typical of early management accounting practice after the industrial revolution, it was a topic of interest to engineers. Church discussed practices that conveyed the management accounting principles of causality and analogy but never formally defined them. The content of this series was reprinted in The History of Accounting Journal in 1976. :1923 ‚Äì John Maurice Clark. Studies in the Economics of Overhead Costs. Management Accounting theory developed and was embedded in his cost allocation discussion; Clark stressed the need to consider causes and their effects. He was also the first to delineate operational cost concepts from decision cost concepts having introduced the concept of avoidability. :1936 to 1954 ‚Äì Committee on Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards (CACS). Operating under the direction of the American Accounting Association, CACS had determined to develop accounting principles and standards for all fields of accounting. :1954 ‚Äì Benninger. The Accounting Review. \\"The principles accepted would not need to be restrictive, except in the sense that any proper practice restricts departure from it. They should deal more with fundamental methods of expressing accounting facts than with the extent of \\"disclosures\\" in published statements.\\" and \\"‚Ä¶ the cost accountant could be more effective the further his basic data were from the general ledger.\\" :1979 ‚Äì Shillinglaw. Cost Accounting Principles for External Reporting: A Conceptual Framework. \\"A body of concepts, principles, and practices has evolved over the years, gradually becoming what might be referred to as generally accepted cost accounting principles (1979, 157-158).\\" (Note: Shillinglaw's proposed principles were only considered for the select area of Cost Accounting ‚Äì one offshoot of management accounting to serve external financial accounting specifically. His framework's stated intent was not to cater for Management Accounting per se but it nevertheless argued for causality as a principle.) :1983 ‚Äì Choudhury. Accounting and Business Research. In discussing the confusion surrounding the lack of common and meaningful management accounting terminology says, \\"‚Ä¶ we are no nearer to being provided with a coherent theory of, if you like, a conceptual framework for management accounting.\\" Choudhury did not; however, propose a management accounting conceptual framework. :2002 ‚Äì Richardson. Accounting Historians Journal. Alan Richardson documents five reasons why managerial accounting has been dominated by financial accounting: # the use of financial accounting criteria to judge the quality of management accounting systems, # the assignment of management accountants to subordinate positions in organizational units whose primary purpose was financial accounting, # the dominance of financial accounting in the market for educational materials, # the judgment of the labor market that a financial accountant could replace a management accountant (but not vice versa) and, # the need for a young profession to gain and retain the support of established interests in society. :2005 - International Federation of Accountants, Professional Accountants in Business Committee. Information Paper: The Roles And Domain of the Professional Accountant in Business. Under the Standards and Guidance section it states, \\"The purpose of principles-based good practice guidance is to encourage effective and efficient decision-making and the adoption of tools and techniques that can be applied intelligently within different types of organizations. Principles-based good practice guidance focuses on performance by addressing the value-creating processes and procedures that support robust business outcomes and successful organizations.\\" :2007 ‚Äì Van der Merwe. Cost Management Journal. The Management Accounting Philosophy series of articles. This series relied heavily on Shillinglaw's work with one exception. It added a philosophical foundation by using the basic Epistemology of Deductive reasoning and Inductive reasoning and two of the four laws of logic to show that management accounting's two principles are causality and analogy and that they are rooted in a bedrock of truth. :2009 ‚Äì International Federation of Accountants, Professional Accountants in Business Committee. International Good Practice Guidance: Evaluation and Improving Costing in Organizations. The principles as proposed in the Management Accounting Philosophy series (referenced above; 2007) were adopted in IFAC's International Good Practice Guidance (IGPG). :2009 ‚Äì International Federation of Accountants, Professional Accountants in Business Committee. Information Paper: Evaluating the Costing Journey: A Costing Levels Continuum Maturity Model. The maturity model was published as supplementary to the principles-based IGPG (referenced above) to allow companies to assess where they were on the proposed costing continuum as far as their management accounting maturity is concerned. Resource Consumption Accounting (RCA) was found to be the most advanced method available today. :2011 ‚Äì Institute of Management Accountants. Strategic Finance Journal. In the October 2011 issue, an article titled Why We Need a Conceptual Framework for Managerial Costing provides a brief overview of the reasons why management accounting needs its own framework distinctly separate for internal managers. :2012 ‚Äì Institute of Management Accountants, Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework Task Force. Conceptual Framework for Managerial Costing. An Exposure Draft was released July 2012 for public comment and is the most extensive and thorough guidance available to management accounting practitioners and users of management accounting information. :2014 ‚Äì Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs). Two of the world's foremost accountancy bodies combined to create a new set of principles to guide best practice. Importance and objectives Management accounting for use inside an organization must reflect the reality of the operations and resources used by the organization in monetary terms. Unlike financial reporting, where the objective focuses on external investors and creditors seek to compare investment options across the capital markets, management accounting focuses on the economic choices and constraints within an organization. There are two interrelated parts in understanding why management accounting principles are so important and how these principles help managers achieve their primary objective: enterprise optimization. The first principal part deals with the actual modeling of a company's operations, where the management accountant establishes and builds causal relationships based on the principle of causality and related management accounting concepts. Part two involves the principle of analogy and the manager's analytical needs for decision support information provided by part one (its cause-and-effect relationships). Part two requires analyzing the information in light of one or more decision alternatives so that the decision maker(s) can reach the optimum decision. The cumulative application of both principles (causality and analogy) achieves management accounting's objectives and fulfills the managers' needs ‚Äì the optimization of the company's operations, generally referred to as enterprise optimization. First objective - managerial costing is: * To provide a monetary reflection of the provision and utilization of business resources and, * To provide cause and effect insights into past, present, or future enterprise economic activities. Second objective ‚Äì managerial costing aids managers: * In their planning, analysis, and decision making and, * Supports optimizing the achievement of an enterprise's strategic objectives. At a more granular level the consistent application of management accounting's principles hold a number of benefits for an organization. * Provide managers and employees with an accurate, objective cost model of the organization and cost information that reflects the use of the organization's resources. * Present decision support information in a flexible mold that caters to the timeline and insights needed for internal decision makers. * Provide decision makers insight into the marginal/incremental aspects of the alternatives they are considering. * Model quantitative cause and effect linkages between outputs and the inputs required to produce and deliver final outputs. * Accurately values all operations (support and production) of an entity (i.e. the supply and consumption of resources) in monetary terms. * Provides information that aids in immediate and future economic decision making for optimization, growth, and/or attainment of enterprise strategic objectives. * Provides information to evaluate performance and learn from results. * Provides the basis and baseline factors for exploratory and predictive managerial activities Truth as the foundation It is managerial accountants' job to provide correct information to all internal managers. In other words, the costing information gathered must be factual and truthful, as in 'what is the cost that reflects the actual use of the resources and processes'. Therefore, truth corresponds to facts and when applied to Management Accounting it translates to resources in operation creates a factual situation. Obviously, the resources and operations about which a manager makes decisions on are based on factual information. The manager's decision will act to change the current situation since the manager is interested in the economic impact of the possible outcomes. Philip Lawton, investment professional and co-author of The Top Ten Operational Risks: A Survival Guide for Investment Management Firms and Hedge Funds writes ::\\"Managerial costing is not to be confused with cost accounting. The latter (cost accounting) applies financial reporting conventions to inventory valuation, transfer pricing, and the cost of goods and services sold, and it serves the informational requirements of external parties, including investors, creditors, regulators, and tax authorities. Managerial costing is intended for internal use; it supports the decisions that managers make to optimize operations. The authors observe, \\"The stock market clearly does not value a company for excellently prepared financial statements if operational excellence is lacking.\\" Moreover, in order to capture outputs and their required inputs, well-executed managerial costing uses data drawn from operational and logistical systems rather than general ledger accounts. In this way, operational quantities and costs are tied to the organization's internal value chain.\\" The Correspondence theory of truth was originally defined by Aristotle; however, a simpler and more up-to-date definition is: \\"A statement or opinion is true if what it corresponds to is a fact.\\" The correspondence definition of truth forms the foundational building blocks for management accounting's principles. In this regard, the foundation of MAP is grounded in the laws of logic and structured reasoning outlined and discussed at length in the Management Accounting Philosophy series published in Cost Management. The recognition of truth as the basis for management accounting goes back a long way. This emphasis on truth should not be confused with precision; it should be clear that costing methods are disputable, while principles are not. Principles support managers who are required to make inferences about future outcomes of all the decision alternatives they are considering based on cause and effect insights. The use of principles enables managers to deal with causes and their effects in different time frames. This is not to say that management accounting is a science, it is not. But Decision science ‚Äîthat which management accounting supports, with the information it provides ‚Äî is a science The growth of management accounting and its practices as outlined in Management Accounting ‚Äì Approaches, Techniques and Management Processes, mentions that management accountants remain dissatisfied with the quality of their management accounting information in the absence of guiding principles. This disconnect is clearly documented in research such as the 2003 Survey of Management Accounting by Ernst & Young LLP; co-sponsored by IMA and the follow up survey 2012 Alta Via, SAP, and IMA Management Accounting Survey: A Replication and Longitudinal Comparison. Confusion and frustration took hold of the MA profession partly because accountants were trying to satisfy two very different goals with one information system; the compliance needs of financial reporting (GAAP) alongside managerial costing decision analysis needs. In addition, controllers, accountants, and managers who were seeking to improve operations or resolve internal costing issues discovered that when selecting different costing methods, each one subscribes to assorted allocation techniques and produces very different results. And finally, the lack of a conceptual framework and foundational principles that previously did not exist in order to do costing for internal decision support. Contradicting theories and practices do not instill trust or truth towards the optimization of an entity. Foundational principles are intended to drive the classification of approaches, tools, and processes, thereby providing a way for accountants and managers to evaluate the tools and approaches they may be considering for the decision or costing tasks at hand. The principles function as a way of better understanding the risks and compromises associated with a practice or method when it strays from the principles of causality and analogy. Not GAAP Companies need to identify the economic reality of their organization based on resources and operations, not reflect dollar values calculated using accrual-based accounting methods that conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States). Accountants may argue that financial accounting principles represent true values and are more than sufficient for management accounting purposes. Maximizing financial statement results is a primary objective; however, focusing only on accounting numbers or common financial ratios can lead to bad behavior versus focusing on operations and resource use for long term sustainable economic success. By examining two of the four financial accounting principles, it will reveal that financial accounting principles (e.g., Historical cost, Revenue recognition, Matching principle, and Full Disclosure) do not serve the objectives of management accounting. Let's examine the following two GAAP principles: :a) Historical cost principle (Kieso, Weygandt and Warfield)p38 ‚Äì the only time this principle reflects cost is at the initial time of purchase or acquisition. In subsequent periods, the historical cost along with taxation-driven depreciation methods does not help managers determine their current operational cost factors. :b) Matching principle (Kieso, Weygandt and Warfield)p40 ‚Äì this principle mandates that the costs (expenses) must follow revenues or adopt the best \\"rational and systematic\\" allocation of costs associated with the benefit, including assumptions about when the benefit (and therefore costs) are to be received. Clearly, managers who are required to perform a cost analysis would have no idea under the matching principle what costs would be included/excluded or be currently impacting his department. The two financial accounting principles noted above briefly describes the chasm that exists between financial accounting and managerial accounting objectives. Financial accounting's objective is to produce a coherent set of standards for consistency and comparability purposes; therefore, providing external parties in the capital markets, a level playing field for evaluating a company's individual performance as well as across other competing businesses. Where Management accounting's objectives exist is to inform internal managers of the correct choices for long term economic success. As discussed with Larry R. White, task force member of the Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework, in CFO.com, ::\\"Manufacturing companies, in particular, often run into problems from the use of GAAP models for internal costing purposes, White notes. \\"We've seen factories where salesmen line up to get their orders run by the oldest production line in the factory, while there are brand-new production lines and machines sitting idle that would produce the order quicker and with better quality. The reason is that the factory was doing its costing based on a derivation of GAAP standards. Consequently, the fully depreciated machines didn't have a depreciation charge associated with them, where the newer machinery did.\\" Concepts and Constraints Diagram of Principles, Concepts, and Constraints specific to the field of Management Accounting and its internal business users. =Principles= Management accountants can rely on causality and analogy as foundational principles as they are grounded in decision science ‚Äì the laws of logic. :* Causality principle ‚Äî the relation between a managerial objective's quantitative output and the input quantities that must be, or must have been, consumed if the output is to be achieved. Principle of Causality enables modeling the organization's costs based on the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the resources involved in the production of products and services it provides. Often this is straightforward when dealing with strong causal relationships (i.e. raw materials to make product A). However, where weaker causal relationships exist, costs need to be attributed according to the concept of attributability, which maintains the integrity of causality. :* Analogy principle ‚Äî the use of causal insights to infer past or future outcomes. Principle of Analogy governs the user of management accounting information's ability to apply the knowledge or insights gained from the causal relationships modeled (e.g., in planning, control, what-if analysis) using inductive and deductive reasoning about past and future outcomes for continuous optimization efforts. =Concepts= The following concepts serve as operational guidelines and modeling building blocks to the two main principles (causality and analogy) in developing a reflective cause & effect model and then using the information the model provides. These concepts are intended to cover a variety of assumptions that would make up a model, their characteristics, and relationships and to provide rational perspectives when modeling many managerial costing issues. The first ten concepts support the Principle of Causality the modeling of Cause&Effect- based; modeling principles, while the remaining four concepts are applicable to the Principle of Analogy and informational in nature and supports managers with decision making guidelines. :Concepts applicable to causality and modeling: * Attributability * Capacity * Cost * Homogeneity * Integrated data orientation * Managerial objective * Resource * Responsiveness * Traceability * Work :Concepts applicable to analogy and information use: * Avoidability * Divisibility * Interdependence * Interchangeability =Constraints= The following constraints have been identified for management accounting. The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of these constraints are meant to serve as controls or checks and balances when constructing a cost model or when using management accounting information. The first five constraints are specific to Causality in the cost model, while the remaining two constraints deal with Analogy and the use of the information.Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework :Constraints applicable to causality: * Materiality * Measurability * Objectivity * Verifiability :Constraints applicable to analogy information use: *Congruence *Impartiality See also * Convention of consistency * Event to knowledge, timeliness of financial information References =Notes= External links * International Federation of Accountants * Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) Publisher of Strategic Finance and Management Accounting Quarterly Management accounting United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ","title":"Management accounting principles"},{"id":"36561176","text":"The Episcopal Conference of Panama is the union of all the bishops of Panama, which in turn are the holders of each diocese.

Pulp stones are not painful unless they impinge on nerves. They are classified: :A) On the basis of structure ::1) True pulp stones: formed of dentin by odontoblasts ::2) False pulp stones: formed by mineralization of degenerating pulp cells, often in a concentric pattern :B) On the basis of location ::1) Free: entirely surrounded by pulp tissue ::2) Adherent: partly fused with dentin ::3) Embedded: entirely surrounded by dentin  Introduction  Pulp stones are discrete calcifications found in the pulp chamber of the tooth which may undergo changes to become diffuse pulp calcifications such as dystrophic calcification. They are usually noticed by radiographic examination and appeared as round or ovoid radiopaque lesions. Clinically, a tooth with a pulp stone has normal appearance like any other tooth. The number of pulp stones in a single tooth may vary from 1 to 12 or more, with varying sizes from minute particles to large masses which tend to occlude the pulpal space. It is reported that pulp stones are more commonly found in the coronal region of pulp, albeit also found in the radicular pulp. It is believed that pulp stones develop around a central nidus of pulp tissue, for instance collagen fibril, ground substance and necrotic cell remnants. Initial calcification occurs around the central nidus and extends outward with regular calcified material in a concentric or radial manner.  Etiology  The pulp calcifications can arise due to: * pulp degeneration * increasing age * circulatory disturbances within the pulp * long standing local irritants such as dental caries, pulp-capping procedures, healed tooth fractures, tooth injury restorations and periodontal diseases * orthodontic tooth movements * transplantation of teeth * trauma It is shown that pulp stone occurring in adolescents is significantly associated with carious and/or restored teeth, which suggests a causative relationship of chronic pulp irritation to pulp stone formation. A defence reaction in the pulpodentinal complex may be triggered by caries and microleakage around restorations which lead to pulp calcifications. The formation of pulp stone may have a similar mechanism as the tertiary dentine formation near the irritated odontoblasts. Apart from that, with aging, the pulp decreases in size due to the deposition of secondary or tertiary dentine. This subsequently results in favourable conditions for the formation of pulpal calcifications. The other reported etiologic factors also include: * idiopathic factors * consumption of fluoride supplements * hypervitaminosis D * a possible genetic predisposition such as dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentinal dysplasia  Types or Classification  Pulp stones can be classified based on different location and structure. Based on location, they can classified into free, embedded and adherent pulp stones. Free pulp stones are found within the pulp tissue and is the most common encounter. The size vary from 50Œºm in diameter to several millimetres and may occlude the entire pulp chamber. Embedded pulp stone is fully embedded in dentine and most commonly found in the apical portion of the root. Adherent pulp stones are attached to the wall of pulp space but not fully enclosed by dentine. Structurally, pulp stones can be classified as true and false pulp stones. True pulp stones are made up of dentine that is lined by odontoblast. True pulp stones are quite rare. On the other hand, false pulp stones are made up of concentric layers of mineralised tissue around blood thrombi, collagen fibres, or dying and dead cells.  Histopathology  Histologically, there are two types of stones: (1) stones with regular calcifications (2) stones with irregular calcifications. For regular calcification, the pulp stones are smooth, round or ovoid with concentric laminations. It is commonly found in the coronal pulp. As for irregular calcifications without laminations, pulp stones may have the shape of rods or leaves and the surface is rough. It is more common in the radicular pulp. Pulp stones with regular calcification grow in size by addition of collagen fibrils to their surface, whereas the irregular type of pulp stones are formed by calcification of pre-existing collagen fibres. Pulp stones may also form around epithelial cells such as remnants of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath. It is presumed that epithelial remnants are able to induce adjacent mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into odontoblast.  Associations  A pilot study was done with patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and it shows increased incidence of pulp stones in teeth with patients with CVD compared to healthy patients without CVD. There are also researchers which suggest the link between pulpal calcification and carotid artery calcification, despite not having a strong proof on this correlation. Besides cardiovascular disease, other disease such as end stage renal disease, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Calcinosis universalis, tumoral calcinosis are also discovered to be in association with pulpal calcifications. Several genetic diseases such as dentin dysplasia and dentinogenesis imperfecta are also accompanied by pulpal calcifications and hence, Marfan syndrome was suspected to be in association with pulp stones due to abnormal dentin formation, leading to the increased frequency of pulpal calcifications in these individuals. Another theory suggests that individuals with Marfan syndrome have connective tissue dysplasia or vascular defects which in the case of tooth pulp, endothelial rupture of the pulp arterioles will lead to hemorrhagic areas in the pulp. It was proposed that these hemorrhagic areas in the pulp will induce mineralization within the pulp.  Prevalence  Pulpal calcifications can be developed throughout the life and prevalence rates from 8‚Äì9% in worldwide population had been reported in studies.It was also found that pulpal stones occurred most frequently over the fourth decade, in advancing age. Generally, pulp stones are more frequent to be found in maxillary teeth compared to mandibular teeth. A study in Australia resulted higher occurrences of pulp stones in molars as opposed to premolars, and first molars as opposed to second molars. First molars which were restored and/or with caries showed a higher incidence of pulp stones as compared to intact, unrestored first molars.  Clinical Implications  Pulp stones generally do not have significant clinical implications as they are usually not a source of pain, discomfort or any form of pulpitis. However, when the tooth concerned will undergo endodontic treatment such as root canal treatment, presence of large pulp stones will be clinically significant. Large pulp stones in the pulp chamber might block the access to canal orifices and prevent the exploring dental instruments from passaging down the canal. In these cases, burs or even ultrasonic instrumentation can be used to remove the blocking pulp stones. During the removal process, sodium hypochlorite which has dissolving action can also be used as a synergistic effect.

A team titlist and medalist at several international competitions: the 2016 Summer Olympics where his event team brought home a Bronze Medal, the 2013 World Fencing Championships where they brought home a team silver medal, brought home the title of the 2014‚Äì15 Fencing World Cup, and the 2017 World Fencing Championships with a team silver medal. Personal life Imboden was born in Tampa, Florida. His parents gave him his name after the Jonny Quest character Race Bannon. He moved to Atlanta at a young age. His first sports were inline skating and BMX; an inline skating accident left him with a crooked nose and a scar on his lip. He was playing with a toy sword in a park when a stranger suggested to his parents that he take up fencing. Shortly afterwards his family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York City. Imboden joined the Fencer's Club in Manhattan, where he first met Jed Dupree and Dan Kellner, both of whom were foil fencing Olympians at the 2004 Summer Olympics. They worked with him as a student, and Imboden made several connections. One lasting connection was that of the friendship to his long- time colleague Declan MacPherson, who Imboden notably gave an autograph to upon their first meeting. Imboden was educated at the Dwight School, which supported his budding sports career. His debut international competition came at age 14 when he won a bronze medal in the cadet (U17) 2010 world fencing championships. After graduating high school in spring 2011 he reconsidered his earlier signed intent to immediately attend Notre Dame, and took a year to focus on his training. He became a member of the Brooklyn Bridge Fencing Club, in the DUMBO section of Brooklyn, with Dan Kellner as his coach. He finally opted for St. John's University in New York, because it is closer to his family and coach. Imboden's other passion is hip hop. He interned at independent label Fool's Gold in 2012 and is a DJ in his spare time. Career Imboden (right) with Team USA on the podium of the 2013 World Fencing Championships Imboden joined the national cadet (U17) team in 2010 and capped the year with the Cadet National Championship title. A year later, he was an individual titlist at the Senior National Championship in Portland, Oregon, and team foil titlist at the 2011 and 2012 Pan American Fencing Championships. At the age of 17, he made the senior national team for the 2011 World Championships in Catania. For his first participation to an event of this magnitude, he reached the quarter-finals after seeing off triple world titlist Peter Joppich, but lost to France's Victor Sint√®s. At the beginning of the 2011‚Äì12 World Cup he stood on the World Cup podium for his bronze medal in the Challenge International de Paris. His good international results qualified him to the US national team to compete at the London 2012 Summer Olympics with the top-ranked team in the Americas zone. Seeded No. 4, he finished 9th after being eliminated in the table of 16 by Andrea Baldini of Italy.Men's Individual Foil, London 2012. In the team event, No. 5 seeded USA prevailed over France, lost to Italy (who would win the gold medal), and a loss followed in the bronze medal match with Germany. In 2013 Imboden won the gold medal at the 2013 Copa Villa La Habana, his first World Cup title, breaking a 14-year drought of US Foil World Cup titlists. He is now one of two US men's foil fencers to have won a World Cup competition. In June of the same year he won a silver medal in the Pan American fencing Championships in Cartagena after being defeated in the final by his teammate Gerek Meinhardt. At the 2013 World Fencing Championships in Budapest Imboden was defeated in the table of 16 by Ukraine's Rostyslav Hertsyk, who later earned a bronze medal. He took part in the team event for the United States, who lost the final to Italy and took the silver medal. Imboden finished 10th in the 2012‚Äì13 FIE world rankings. Imboden began the 2013‚Äì14 season win a silver medal finish in the 2013 World Combat Games. He won his second USA Division-1 National Championship title in April 2014, defeating David Willette 15‚Äì6. He placed second in the SK Troph√©e in Seoul and third in the Prince Takamado World Cup. The World Championships in Kazan were a disappointment as Imboden was defeated in the table of 16 by teammate Gerek Meinhardt. In the team event, No.4 seed USA lost to eventual silver medallist China in the quarter-finals and finished fifth. Imboden finished the season world No.10 for the second time in a row. In the 2014‚Äì15 season Imboden made the quarter-finals in the San Francisco World Cup and proceeded to win gold at the Prince Takamodo World Cup in Tokyo after overcoming Russia's Dmitry Rigin in the final. He posted a third place in the Trofeo Inalpi in Turin, Italy. In January 2015 he achieved a double gold at the Challenge International de Paris: he became the first American to win the individual event after defeating Italy's Daniele Garozzo, then earned a second gold medal in the team event after Team USA prevailed over Italy. Imboden then took a bronze medal in the Havana Grand Prix. In April he won the Master de Fleuret in Melun, prevailing over Ma Jianfei in the final. Two weeks later he earned the gold medal at the 2015 Pan American Championships in Santiago, his third individual Pan American title. The 2015 World Championships in Moscow proved a disappointment: Imboden was defeated in the table of 16 by Olympic champion Lei Sheng. In the team event, the United States lost to Italy in the quarter-finals and finished sixth after the placement rounds. Imboden did, however, ended the season World no.1, ten points ahead of newly crowned world champion Yuki Ota, thus becoming the first American male fencer to win the overall World Cup. In the 2015‚Äì16 season Imboden achieved another double-gold haul at the Paris World Cup, becoming the first fencer since Benjamin Kleibrink in 2006‚Äì2007 to win back-to-back editions. Three podiums out of three World Cup competitions sealed the United States' qualification to the team event of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, guaranteeing three American slots in the individual event. Despite a further bronze medal at the Havana Grand Prix and a no.4 world ranking, Imboden was overtaken in the US rankings and qualified to the Olympics only as a reserve for the team event. At the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, Imboden and teammates Gerek Meinhardt and Nick Itkin won gold medals for the US men's foil team. Pan-Am Games protest Following the U.S. men‚Äôs foil team victory at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, which earned Imboden and teammates Gerek Meinhardt and Nick Itkin gold medals, Imboden knelt on one knee on the medal podium as the United States national anthem played. Meinhardt and Itkin stood. He stated in a post on Twitter that he had done so as a protest against racism, for gun control, mistreatment of immigrants, and the rhetoric of President Donald Trump. United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee spokesperson Mark Jones criticized Imboden, as all athletes are to commit to refraining from political actions and demonstrations, stating \\"In this case, Race didn‚Äôt adhere to the commitment he made to the organizing committee and the USOPC. We respect his rights to express his viewpoints, but we are disappointed that he chose not to honor his commitment.\\" Imboden had previously mounted a similar protest with a teammate at a World Cup event in Egypt in 2017. On 21 August 2019, Imboden was placed on a twelve-month probation by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee for his protest at the Pan American Games. Modeling He began modelling for Quest Models after being scouted by an agent during the London Olympics. In 2013 he made models.com's \\"hot list\\" of the most in-demand newcomers in the business. In 2015 he began working with Wilhelmina Models. He left school during his first year to concentrate on his modelling and international career, as under NCAA rules he could not take part in collegiate fencing while being paid to model.

In particular, the numbers 37 and 38 refer to the Episcopal Conferences. Previously, the decree specifies: \\"From the first centuries of the Church, the bishops who were in charge of particular churches, moved by the communion of fraternal charity and zeal for the universal mission entrusted to the Apostles, joined forces and wills to promote the good of the particular Churches. \\" (Cf. 36). Further emphasizes that, in modern times, the bishops find it very difficult to fulfill in a timely and fruitful mission \\"but work closely together with other bishops.\\" The Council reminds the institution, in some nations, of the Episcopal Conferences, which have allowed a more coordinated and apostolate, therefore, more fruitful, so that \\"this sacred Council thinks should be large so that in all the earth, the Bishops of the same nation or region are grouped into single board (assembly), meeting at stated times, in order to communicate the lights of prudence and experience, to deliberate together to form a holy force cooperation for the common good of the churches \\"(cf. 37).

In 1021/22, he surrendered his kingdom to the Byzantine emperor Basil II, receiving in return extensive lands in the Empire, and the governorship of Cappadocia.  Life  Senekerim-Hovhannes was the youngest son of Abusahl- Hamazasp. He had two older brothers, Ashot-Sahak and Gurgen-Khachik. On the death of Abusahl in 968, the kingdom was divided among his three sons, and Ashot, as the eldest, retained the royal title and the suzerainty over his younger brothers. On his death, royal power was usurped by the second son, Gurgen, who reigned as king until his own death in 1003. In 1000, when the Byzantine emperor Basil II visited the East and annexed the principality of Tao, both Senekerim and his brother Gurgen visited him and paid him homage, receiving rich gifts in return. According to Stephen of Taron, Basil also sent letters to the neighbouring Muslim potentates declaring that Vaspurakan was under his protection, and warning them to stop their raids. Matthew of Edessa on the other hand reports that Basil concluded a treaty of alliance with the two brothers. The throne of Senekerim-Hovhannes Artsruni 1880-1892 Following Gurgen's death in 1003, Senekerim also withheld power from his nephews and crowned himself king. Throughout his reign, his position on the throne remained insecure, partly due to his usurpation, and partly due to the ever mounting raids of various Turkmen groups. As a result he approached Basil, along with his relative, the Artsruni ruler of Andzevatsi, offering to surrender their realms to the Empire in exchange for large domains in eastern Asia Minor. Mounting Turkish pressure, and especially a devastating raid in 1018/19, in which the Armenian army proved unable to counter the Turkish horse archers, eventually led to the cession of Vaspurakan being realized in the winter of 1021/22. The entire realm, comprising 72 fortresses and 3,000 to 4,400 villages, according to contemporary accounts, was annexed by the Byzantines and became the new theme (province) of Asprakania or Upper Media. Basil Argyros became the new province's first governor. In recompense, Senekerim received the title of patrikios and the post of strategos of the theme of Cappadocia, as well as possession of the cities of Sebasteia, Larissa, Abara and many other settlements. He was followed west by his family and 14,000 retainers. Several of Senekerim's relatives likewise received titles and gifts from the Emperor. Senekerim died in 1025 or 1027, although Matthew of Edessa erroneously places his death in 1029/30. He was succeeded by his eldest son David.  Family  Senekerim was married to a lady called Khushush (ŒßŒøœÖœÉŒøœçœÉŒ±, Chousousa, in Greek). He had four sons, David, Atom, Abu Sahl, and Constantine, and apparently two daughters, including Mariam of Vaspurakan, the first wife of the Georgian king George I, and another, whose name is recorded in incomplete form as S.n.ghar.

Louie has been the chief of the Osoyoos Indian Band in British Columbia's Okanagan for ten terms, the first beginning in 1985. He has been credited with contributing to the economic success of the small community, and has received regional, national, and international recognition, including the Order of British Columbia in 2004 and the Order of Canada in 2016.\\"Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist\\". CBC News, December 30, 2016. Early life Louie was born near Oliver in 1960 and raised on the Osoyoos reserve by a single mother. Due to high unemployment, many adults in the community had to work as transient labourers on fruit orchards in nearby Washington state. Louie was forced to be self-sufficient during his childhood years. At age 19, he left British Columbia and enrolled in First Nations University in Regina, Saskatchewan. He then studied native studies at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta. After receiving his degree, he returned to the Okanagan. Tenure as Chief At 24 years of age, Louie was elected as chief of the Osoyoos Indian Band. The band has 460 members, and controls of land. He started the Osoyoos Indian Band Development Corporation (OIBDC) in 1988. Through the corporation's efforts, the previously impoverished band started or acquired nine businesses, including tourism, construction, and recreation companies. The band now employs 700 people including non-First Nations. A high-profile business started by the OIBDC during Louie's tenure is Nk'Mip Cellars, the first aboriginal-owned winery in North America. Louie has served 10 terms as of 2012, winning every election but one since 1985. He consulted with federal finance minister Jim Flaherty in 2008 on matters of economic development. He is a two-term chair of the National Aboriginal Economic Development Board. In 2003, Louie was chosen by the U.S. Department of State as one of six Canadian First Nations leaders to review economic development in American Indian communities.

A specialist steeplechaser, he ran twenty-one time and won ten races. He campaigned mainly at distances in excess of three miles and was particularly effective on soft or heavy ground. Over a period of sixteen months between November 1993 and March 1995 Master Oats won nine of his eleven races and improved from racing in minor handicaps to become the highest-rated staying chaser in Britain. His winning run culminated in a win in the 1995 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He also ran in three editions of the Grand National, twice carrying top weight. His later career was disrupted by injury and he failed to win again after his Gold Cup success. Master Oats was retired from racing in 1998 and died in 2012. Background Master Oats was a chestnut horse with a narrow white stripe bred by Robin and Scarlett Knipe at the Cobhall Court Stud near Allensmore in Herefordshire. He was sired by Oats, a successful National Hunt stallion whose other progeny included the Champion Hurdle winner Flakey Dove. Master Oats was sent to the Doncaster Sales as a foal in 1986 where he was sold for ¬£6,000. He first raced in the colours of Mrs Hugh Maitland-Jones and was sent into training with Henrietta Knight. After one run in an amateur Point-to-point race he was moved to the Lambourn stable of Kim Bailey, who trained him throughout the rest of his racing career. Master Oats usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Throughout his racing career, Master Oats suffered from a tendency to break blood vessels under stress, and therefore had to be trained with unusual care. Racing career =1991-1992: early career= Unlike many steeplechasers, Master Oats never competed in National Hunt flat races or over hurdles. He ran once without success in an amateur point-to-point race before beginning his career under National Hunt rules in Novice chases. After being pulled-up at Newbury Racecourse in November, he was campaigned at minor tracks, winning at Southwell Racecourse and being place at Wolverhampton and Stratford. After his first season, Master Oats' racing career was disrupted by injury and he was off the racecourse for eighteen months. During this time he entered into the ownership of Paul Matthews. =1993/1994 season= Master Oats returned in November 1993 with an official rating of 107, placing him approximately sixty pounds below championship class. He began in a handicap race at Uttoxeter Racecourse and won by a length and a half despite breaking a blood vessel. This was the first occasion on which he was ridden by Norman Williamson who became his regular jockey. In late December he won a similar event at Huntingdon Racecourse by twelve lengths under top weight of 165 pounds and then finished second at Wincanton in January. Later that month he won a handicap at Lingfield Park by two lengths despite being eased down by Williamson at the finish. Master Oats' rating had moved up to 137 by this time although his most valuable race win had earned bis owners less than ¬£4,000. Master Oats' next race saw him take on much stronger opposition in the Greenalls Gold Cup over three and a half miles at Kempton Park (moved from Haydock Park because of bad weather). The race was considered a trial for the Grand National and attracted leading chasers including Garrison Savannah (Cheltenham Gold Cup), Young Hustler (RSA Chase) and Moorcroft Boy (Scottish Grand National). Williamson sent Master Oats into the lead four fences from the finish and the gelding \\"turned the race into a procession\\" (according to The Independent) staying on strongly on the soft ground to win by fifteen lengths. At Aintree Racecourse on 9 April, Master Oats started third favourite of the thirty-six runners in the 1994 Grand National at odds of 9/1, and was expected to be ideally suited by the heavy ground. Master Oats appeared to be going well and was moving up towards the leaders when he fell at the thirteenth fence of the race won by Miinnehoma. The horse was not injured and returned two weeks later to end his season with a very easy win under top weight in a race at Perth. =1994/1995 season= Master Oats first run of the 1994/95 season saw him pitted against the 1992 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Cool Ground and the 1992 Grand National winner Party Politics in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow. He took the lead at the eleventh fence and stayed on to repel the challenge of Party Politics by four lengths. On New Year's Eve Master Oats started 5/2 joint favourite for the Welsh National over three and three quarter miles on heavy ground. The race was moved to Newbury from its traditional venue at Chepstow, where racing had been abandoned owing to the weather and ground conditions. Williamson sent him into the lead four fences from the finish and the horse steadily increased his lead to win by twenty lengths from Earth Summit. After the race he was heavily backed for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, and bookmakers responded by cutting his odds from 16/1 to 9/2 favourite. The ground remained heavy in January when Master Oats contested the Pillar Property Chase at Cheltenham, starting favourite ahead of the King George VI Chase winner Barton Bank. On his first appearance at the course, Master Oats went clear of his opponents two fences from the finish and won by fifteen lengths from the mare Dubacilla with Barton Bank third. Following this race Timeform rated Master Oats as the best long- distance chaser in training by a margin of six pounds and described him as looking \\"all over a Gold Cup winner\\". Master Oats went to the 1995 Cheltenham Festival having won four consecutive long distance chases, all on soft or heavy ground. In the Cheltenham Gold Cup he was reopposed by Barton Bank, Dubacilla, Young Hustler and Miinnehoma, but his biggest rival in the betting was Jodami who had won the race in 1993 and finished second to The Fellow in 1994. The ground conditions were among the most testing ever seen at the course and one fence was omitted for safety reasons. Master Oats jumped poorly in the early stages but recovered to take the lead two fences out, overtaking the Irish challenger Merry Gale. He had established a clear lead at the final obstacle and stayed on strongly up the Cheltenham hill to win by fifteen lengths from Dubacilla. The win made Bailey and Williamson the first trainer- jockey combination in forty-five years to win the two most important races at the festival, having won the Champion Hurdle with Alderbrook two days earlier. Williamson, who admitted to having been concerned in the early stages, celebrated with a flying dismount before describing the win as \\"what I've dreamed of all my life.\\" A change in the weather meant that the soft ground which had prevailed throughout the season had changed to \\"good\\" ground by the time that the 1995 Grand National was run three and a half weeks later. Despite the unfavourable ground and top weight of 164 pounds, Master Oats started 5/1 favourite against thirty-four opponents. Williamson positioned the gelding on the far outside of the field and moved forward into second place behind the eventual winner Royal Athlete at Becher's Brook on the second circuit. Master Oats was still in second at the penultimate obstacle, but faded in the closing stages to finish seventh, sixteen lengths behind the winner. Bailey later said that Master Oats was in better form for the National than he had been in the Gold Cup and that \\"if he'd had his [soft] ground, he would have won by half the track.\\" =1995-1997: later career= Master Oats' subsequent career was a disappointment, as he never reproduced the form he showed in 1994 and early 1995. On his first start of the 1995/1996 season he ran inexplicably badly before being pulled up in the Rehearsal Chase. He finished a distant third to One Man in the King George VI Chase at Sandown Park in January 1996 and second to Imperial Call when favourite for the Hennessy Gold Cup a month later. He then sustained a leg injury which prevented him from defending the Gold Cup and ruled him out for the rest of the season. After a break of more than a year, Master Oats returned to racing with the Grand National as his objective. He started favourite for the Grand National Trial Chase at Punchestown Racecourse in February 1997 but was pulled up three fences from the finish. Despite his lack of recent success, he was again allotted top weight of 164 pounds for the 1997 Grand National. He ran well for much of the way before finishing fifth of the thirty-six runners behind Lord Gyllene. According to Williamson, \\"Only sheer courage got him home. He was knackered but it was almost as good as winning.\\" The following year, Master Oats was taking part in a hunt when he sustained a serious tendon injury which ended his racing career. Retirement Master Oats spent his retirement at the home of Lord Leigh near Adlestrop in Gloucestershire, where he was reportedly popular with the villagers. In 2010, he took part in a parade of former champions at the Cheltenham Festival. Master Oats died of a heart attack on 21 May 2012 at the age of twenty-six and was buried at Adlestrop. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Master Oats a \\"superior\\" Gold Cup winner and the twenty-third best steeplechaser of the 20th century.

Fischlin has a BFA in Music Performance, an MA in Interdisciplinary Studies (Musicology/English Literature; Concordia University), and a PhD in English Literature (York University), with a dissertation on the English lute song directed by Richard Hillman. In addition to his research activities in the arts and humanities he has been active as a musician for most of his life, most recently with the free-improvisation group, the Vertical Squirrels. Research Fischlin‚Äôs specialty is early modern Renaissance studies. His experience teaching Shakespeare has led to a number of projects including Adaptations of Shakespeare: A Critical Anthology of Plays from the 17th Century to the Present, co-edited with Mark Fortier, published in 2000 by Routledge. Additionally he is the founder and director of the Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project (CASP), the largest online resource in the world for the study of Shakespeare‚Äôs relation to a national theatrical practice. The website was launched in 2004 and expanded in August 2007. In early 2009, he launched the Shakespeare Made in Canada Virtual Exhibit, which he curated at the MacDonald Stewart Arts Centre, in Guelph, ON. The Exhibit houses a multitude of resources (film, photographs, and other multimedia) that document the relationship between Canadian culture and Shakespeare. It brought together, for the first time, hundreds of rare artifacts, including the Canadian-owned Sanders Portrait of Shakespeare, contemporary Canadian theatre designs, Shakespeare in French Canada, contemporary Aboriginal adaptations of Shakespeare, new portraiture, an innovative learning commons for youth, as well as new and archival material from the CASP project. The exhibit inspired the publication of a book, Shakespeare Made in Canada: Contemporary Canadian Adaptations in Theatre, Pop Media, and Visual Arts, which documented the Shakespeare Made in Canada Exhibit and was edited by Fischlin and co-curator Judith Nasby. Fischlin has experience in humanities computing design and innovation. Among others, he has been creator and designer on a number of online projects including literacy games for youth, interactive readers, content-based site design, and the Romeo + Juliet app, released in 2011 on the Apple iOS platform for iPhone, iPad, and iPod. Fischlin was also the lead designer/creator/producer of ‚ÄòSpeare, an online 3D video game for youth that teaches Shakespearean literacy, launched in April 2007. He was also the creative mind behind the online literacy game Chronos, launched in the fall of 2008 on the CASP site. Additionally, Fischlin played a key role in the 2008 film Battle of Wills by Anne Henderson, documenting the steps taken to authenticate the Sanders Portrait of Shakespeare.http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/RSS_news_articles/Battle_Press%20Kit_avec%20logo-2.pdf Fischlin is a partner of the German Bremer Institut f√ºr Kanada-und Qu√©bec- Studien, BIKQS (Bremen Institute on Canada and Quebec-Studies). Music Fischlin is active as a musician and has recorded most recently with the Vertical Squirrels, an instant composition, free improvisation collective he co-founded with Ajay Heble, Lewis Melville, and Rob Wallace. The Vertical Squirrels is \\"a Canadian free improvisation musical collective dedicated to diverse musical expressions as a teaching and learning tool‚Äì‚Äìand also as a vehicle for building community and establishing positive dialogue across personal, cultural, linguistic, geographic, and political barriers.\\" Initially conceived as an informal outlet to get Heble back into playing piano after years of curating the Guelph Jazz Festival (but rarely performing himself), the Squirrels quickly morphed into a recording and gigging band focused on their distinctive brand of in-the-moment improvisation. Since then, the Vertical Squirrels have performed, playlisted, and reviewed internationally. The band's first CD, Hold True (Accroche-toi!) was released in 2010 on the Montreal-based label Ambiances Magn√©tiques and their second CD, Winter‚Äôs Gate, was released in 2011 under the BarCode Free label. The band‚Äôs latest endeavor is an album in collaboration with Grammy-nominated Canadian jazz musician Jane Bunnett, as well as Larry Cramer, Ben Grossman, and Scott Merritt, forthcoming in 2013.

These latter two books are part of the \\"Rights Trilogy,' co-authored with Nandorfy, which focuses on rights theory from the perspective of storytelling, principles of earth democracy, and a critique of conventional discourses of rights that exclude the environment. The first book in the trilogy, Eduardo Galeano: Through the Looking Glass was the first full-length, critical study of the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano, author of the Memory of Fire trilogy, and of the ground-breaking political critique Open Veins of Latin America. Part political biography, part cultural theory, Fischlin's and Nandorfy's book examines events that shaped Galeano's life through the lens of the rights implications embedded in the stories he tells‚Äîfrom his close personal friendship with Allende, through the dictatorships in Uruguay and Argentina that forced him into exile, to the ongoing relationship between Galeano and Subcomandante Marcos, leader of the Chiapas rebellion. Published with Duke University Press is another co-authored book (with Ajay Heble and George Lipsitz) that addresses rights issues in relation to improvisation and musical discourses associated with jazz, entitled The Fierce Urgency of Now: Improvisation, Rights, and the Ethics of Co-creation.

Movement Disorders 27(6). 771-774. While the link connecting the onset of Parkinson's disease to environmental factors is known, the link between dietary patterns and the disease is just beginning to be researched more fully.Tanner CM (2010). ‚ÄúAdvances in environmental epidemiology‚Äù. Movement Disorders 25(1). S58-S62.Tanner CM, Ottman R, Goldman SM, et al (1999). ‚ÄúParkinson‚Äôs disease in twins: an etiological study‚Äù. JAMA 28(1) 341-346. Additionally, other research has sought to examine the symptoms of the disease and propose methods on how to alleviate these symptoms through changes in diet. Current medications that work to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can also be made more effective through changes in diet. Background Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that results due to the death of dopamine producing cells within the central nervous system. Because of the death of these cells, less dopamine is available within the brain, resulting in tremors and other side effects within motor functions. The reason for the deaths of these cells is a topic of current research, with some theories suggesting a contribution of oxidative stress due to free radicals and inflammation. Currently, there are no treatments to cure Parkinson's disease, yet a variety of treatment options are available to alleviate the symptoms including medication and dietary changes. Dietary prevention and neuroprotection Many theories of the cause of PD symptoms point to the death of dopamine-producing neurons within the central nervous system due to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is caused by metabolism and the production of molecules known as free radicals. Accumulation of these free radicals within the brain can cause damage to neurons. Additionally, dopamine producing neurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to the relatively high levels of metabolism associated with the production of dopamine, resulting in comparatively higher amounts of free radicals being produced by these dopamine-producing neurons.Taulous A, Sullivan A (2008). ‚ÄúProgress in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease‚ÄîWhere Do We Stand?‚Äù Progress in Neurobiology 85. 376-392. The effects of dopamine within the brain are widespread, including the control of voluntary motor control. With the death of these dopamine-producing cells within an area of the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra, the central nervous system has less control over the body, resulting in the tremors and rigidity seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. Antioxidants are suggested to be useful in preventing PD because they scavenge free radicals such as reactive nitrogen and oxygen, preventing their build-up and the destruction of dopamine-producing neurons.Ames BN, Cathcart R, Schwiers E, et al (1981). ‚ÄúUric acid provides an antioxidant defense in humans against oxidant-and radical- caused aging and cancer: a hypothesis‚Äù. Proc Natl Academy Sciences USA 78. 6858-62. Research has attempted to link dietary patterns to the likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease. Promising research shows that a diet consisting of foods typically associated with a Mediterranean diet may act as a preventative measure for the disease due to the high levels of antioxidants found in within these foods such as complex phenols, vitamins C and E, and carotenoids.Joshipura KJ, Hu FB, Manson JE, et al (2001). ‚ÄúThe effect of fruit and vegetable intake on risk for coronary heart disease‚Äù. Ann Intern Med 134. 1106-1114. A typical Mediterranean diet consists of a high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, and cereals, olive oil (unsaturated fatty acids), and fish and low to moderate intake of foods such as dairy, meats, poultry. Other research has shown that diets rich in dairy products result in a higher likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease.Chen H, Zhang SM, Hernan MA, Willet WC, Ascherio A (2002). ‚ÄúDiet and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease: A Potential Role of Dairy Products in Men‚Äù. Ann Neuro 52. 368-375.Chen H, O‚ÄôReilly E, McCullough ML, et al (2007). ‚ÄúConsumption of Dairy Products and Risks of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease‚Äù.

Neurology 64. 1047‚Äì1051. Additionally, it has been seen that the intake of animal fats may be linked to the development of the disease.Logroscino G, Marder K, Cote L, Tang MX, Shea S, Mayeux R (1996). ‚ÄúDietary lipids and antioxidants in Parkinson‚Äôs disease: a population-based, case-control study‚Äù Ann Neuro 39. 89‚Äì94 It has also been suggested that a diet that results in high plasma urate can result in a reduced risk of developing PD due to urate's ability to reduce oxidative stresses by scavenging peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals.Gao X, Chen H, Choi HK, Curhan G, Schwarschild M, Ascherio A (2007). ‚ÄúDiet, Urate, and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Risk in Men‚Äù. American Journal of Epidemiology 167(7). 831‚Äì838. Management of symptoms through diet Typical symptoms of the disease include bodily shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, difficulty in movement, as well as other motor related symptoms. As the disease progresses, patients suffer from cognitive and behavior problems such as dementia, sensory impairment, sleep problems, and emotional issues. PD can have an effect on neurons that control the digestive process, so subjects may experience constipation and gastroparesis due to the disease.Barichella M, Cereda E, Pezzoli G (October 2009). \\"Major nutritional issues in the management of Parkinson's disease\\". Mov. Disord. 24(13): 1881‚Äì92. PD may also make a subject more tired in the later parts of the day, decreasing the likelihood to want to eat food and leading to further dietary problems. No special diet is required for subjects with PD, yet a well balanced diet is beneficial due to the effects of increased energy and improved effectiveness of drugs. Additional, in research it has been shown that nutritionally healthy, balanced meals enable the most effective use of symptom reducing drugs.Berry EM, Growdon JH, Wurtman JJ, Caballero B, Wurtman RJ (1991). \\"A balanced carbohydrate protein diet in the management of Parkinson's disease\\" Neurology 41(8). 1295. In order to cope with the decrease in energy that many patients express, smaller meals are recommended for such cases. A good diet includes high fiber foods (such as vegetables, dried peas, beans, whole grain foods, pasta, rice, and fresh fruit) in order to reduce constipation, low saturated fats and cholesterol, low sugar and salt intake, plenty of water, and limited alcohol intake. Dietary considerations with medications Treatments are only effective in moderating the symptoms of the disease, mainly with drugs including levodopa (L-DOPA) and dopamine agonists. Once too many dopamine producing cells have been lost however, the effects of L-DOPA become less effective. Once this occurs, a complication known as dyskenesia commonly occurs in which subjects undergo involuntary writhing movements despite the use of L-DOPA. The effects of dyskenesia vary between periods of high symptoms and low symptoms. In order to limit the onset of dyskenesia, typical L-DOPA dosages are kept as low as possible while still achieving desired results. Lastly, in cases in which drugs are ineffective, deep brain stimulation and surgery can be used to reduce symptoms.Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, et al. (February 2011). \\"Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease: an expert consensus and review of key issues\\". Arch. Neurol. 68(2): 165. Levodopa is taken orally and is absorbed through the small intestines into the blood, competing for access with natural proteins. Additionally, once the drug has entered the blood stream, L-DOPA utilizes the same pathways to cross the blood brain barrier as natural protein.Pincus JH, Barry KM (1987). \\"Plasma levels of amino acids correlate with motor fluctuations in parkinsonism\\". Arch Neurol 44:1006-9.Berry EM, Growdon JH, Wurtman JJ, Caballero B, Wurtman RJ (1991). \\"A balanced carbohydrate: protein diet in the management of Parkinson‚Äôs disease\\". Neurology 411295-7. Only about 5 ‚Äì 10% of levodopa crosses the blood brain barrier, while the remaining is metabolized elsewhere in the body. The metabolism of medications elsewhere is known to cause side effects such as nausea, dsykinesias, and stiffness.The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions, ed. (2006). \\"Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson‚Äôs disease\\". Parkinson's Disease. London: Royal College of Physicians. pp. 59‚Äì100. . In order to improve the effectiveness of PD drugs such as L-DOPA, a diet low in excessive protein is recommended since L-DOPA competes with these dietary proteins for access to the blood and brain. It is therefore recommended that the drug be taken so that it is not affected by digestion. It is recommended to take L-DOPA ideally 30 minutes before eating or at least 1 hour afterwards. A protein redistribution diet is sometimes recommended in which most protein should be eaten in the afternoon.Leader G, Leader L, Findley L (January 2006). \\"Parkinson‚Äôs Disease: Reducing Symptoms with Nutrition and Drugs\\". Denor Press. London, England. However, with the development of dyskinesias the protein redistribution diet need not apply because slowing the absorption of L-DOPA may be beneficial.Marczewska A, De Notaris R, Sieri S, Barichella M, Fusconi E, Pezzoli G (August 2006). ‚ÄúProtein intake in Parkinsonian patients using the EPIC food frequency questionnaire‚Äù. Movement Disorder 21(8). 1229-31. Plenty of water with the intake of L-DOPA ensures that the drug will be absorbed more quickly. L-DOPA can cause nausea in some subjects when taken on an empty stomach. Methods to reduce nausea include taking carbidopa (Sinemet), sugary drinks to calm the stomach, and avoidance of orange and grapefruit juices due to high acidity. Some PD medications are known to cause the subject to become thirsty, and methods to reduce thirst include drinking plenty of water as well as limiting caffeine uptake because it may interfere with medication or increase thirst.http://www.medicinenet.com/parkinsons_disease_eating_right/article.htm References External links *https://parkinsons.co.in/diet-and- nutrition-for-a-parkinsons-disease-patient/ Parkinson's disease ","title":"Dietary management of Parkinson's disease"},{"id":"36561549","text":"Robert Strelley (by 1518 ‚Äì 23 January 1554), of Great Bowden, Leicestershire, was an English politician.

It was founded in 1862 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012. Early history The Bristol Naturalists' Society was established on 8 May 1862. The purpose of the organisation is to promote natural science through a schedule of regular meetings during which scientific subjects are addressed and associated items may be exhibited. Other goals have included the amassing of a library of books connected to natural science, as well as the publication of the Proceedings of the society. Monthly meetings of the general membership are held from October to May at University College, Bristol, the predecessor to the University of Bristol. The society has maintained close ties to the University of Bristol and the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery throughout its history. During the society's general meetings, lectures are given, usually by club members. At least one excursion is undertaken each summer. In addition to general membership, club members can opt to join one or more of the specialised sections of the association: Botanical, Entomological, and Geological. The sections hold meetings as well. Sections in Chemistry and Ornithology were added later in the nineteenth century. The Library of the Bristol Naturalists' Society was initially in its rooms at the Literary and Philosophic Club at 20 Berkeley Square, now the University and Literary Club (Unilit). In addition to books and periodicals, the library contains other valuable works. The Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society are published annually. Previous presidents of the Bristol Naturalists' Society have included many notable members of the Bristol community. The first president of the organisation was the geologist William Sanders (1799‚Äì1875). He held the office of president from 1862 to 1875. Professor Conwy Lloyd Morgan (1852‚Äì1936) of University College, Bristol, later the University of Bristol, was another eminent member of the community who served as president of the society. Morgan was also elected to the presidency of the Clifton Antiquarian Club. The first female president of the Bristol Naturalists' Society was Ida Roper, who was elected to that office in 1913. Roper was also a member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, contributing papers to the sixth and seventh volumes of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club. Other notable members of the Bristol Naturalists' Society have included three Fellows of the Entomological Society of London: Alfred Edmund Hudd, who was first appointed to the Council of the society in 1875, Stephen Barton (d. 1898), and George C. Griffiths (1852‚Äì1924). Recent history In 1972, the association became a charity. On 29 June 2010, the membership of the Bristol Naturalists' Society approved their constitution at the annual general meeting. The constitution adopted indicated that the objectives of the society were \\"the promotion of education and research into natural history including geology with special reference to the Bristol district\\" and \\"the promotion of the conservation of the British fauna and flora and the protection of geological and physiographical sites.\\" Current specialised sections of the club include Botany, Geology, Invertebrate, Mammal, and Ornithology. The Library of the Bristol Naturalists' Society is located at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery on Queens Road. Lectures held in 2012 include two hosted by the Botanical section: \\"Salisbury Plain\\" by Sharon Pilkington in February, and \\"Plants of the Drawdown Zone\\" by Dr. Camillla Lambrick in March. The Bristol Naturalists' Society celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012. Events held by the society to mark the anniversary included a photographic exhibition, \\"Natural History Photographs of the Region,\\" on 14 April 2012 at Bradbury Hall in Henleaze, Bristol. In addition, an anniversary dinner was held on 8 May 2012 at the Freemasons' Hall in Bristol. The University of Bristol Botanic Garden also celebrated the society's anniversary. Their special event, \\"A Celebration and Illustration of Bristol Flora, New Paintings and Rare Plants of the West Country,\\" was held on 2‚Äì5 June 2012. Publications The Society produces a newsletter ‚Äî The Bulletin for its members, outlining the various talks and walks in the coming month, or so. This is sent out 10 times/year and is edited by David Davies. A continuing feature of the Society had been the production of printed Proceedings. These continue to this day, with the 2013 volume, issued in 2014, being a themed edition, on the subject of 'The Downs'. This was produced under the editorship of Richard Bland. The Society also produces, jointly with the Bristol Ornithological Club, the annual Avon Bird Report. The Society publishes an annual journal, 'Nature in Avon'.

He then joined Bell Labs, first as a post-doctoral researcher, and rising to be the head of the Solid State Physics and Materials Research Division at Bell Labs by 1986. After the discovery of high-temperature superconductors in 1987, Batlogg studied various cuprate compounds and together with Robert Cava discovered several transition metal oxide superconductors with high transition temperatures. In 1997, he won the Bell Labs' Bernd Matthias Prize for his research on superconductivity. Starting in 1998, Batlogg worked with Christian Kloc and Jan Hendrik Sch√∂n to study electronic properties of organic crystals. Over the next two years, the collaboration produced a series of ground-breaking papers regarding properties of these materials. However, the experimental data provided by Sch√∂n were later shown to be fraudulent and several of the most important papers were retracted by the authors.

The park is covered by a very varied, rolling heathland formed as a result of the Saale glaciation. It is a traditional excursion and recreation area in the relatively sparsely wooded heart of Central Germany. Its area is roughly evenly divided between the states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, about midway between Wittenberg in the northeast and Leipzig in the southwest. Other major towns in the immediate vicinity are Dessau, Bitterfeld and Torgau. In the north and northeast the nature park is bounded by the floodplain of the Middle Elbe. On its western perimeter are the towns of Bitterfeld and Gr√§fenhainichen and the River Mulde. The interior of the park is accessible on the B 2 federal highway. It extends south as far as the B 87 with the towns of Eilenburg and Bad D√ºben. Geologically it is a landscape of terminal moraines and sandurs, composed predominantly of coniferous forest, mixed forest, lakes, bogs and grassland. The main species of tree is the pine. The park covers about 770 square kilometres in toto and has a population of 68,400 (as at 31 Dec 2000) with a density of 89 inhabitants per km¬≤. 66% of the area is forest, 29% is used for agriculture, 2% are urban areas, 2% is water and 1% is used by industry and infrastructure. There are about 1,000 kilometres of designated cycle paths and hiking trails. The nature park is supported by the D√ºben Heath Association (Verein D√ºbener Heide). The association, founded on 28 September 1930, was re- established on 31 March 1990.

There is also a centre feature made of painted cast iron. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993 to celebrate the 90th birthday of her mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. It cost ¬£1.5 million to construct, raised by private individuals and public funding, under the patronage of Prince Michael of Kent. The stainless steel and bronze gates, railings and lights were designed and made by Giusseppe Lund. The centre piece, featuring a red lion (England) and a white unicorn (Scotland), was designed by sculptor David Wynne. The organic nature of the forged steel reflects the Queen Mother's love of flowers, particularly those from a cottage garden. Her life spanned most of the century and this is represented by a flow from formal symmetry at the base of the gates upwards to an increasing freedom of line at the top. Many of the elements are free to move when touched and the whole structure vibrates when moved. This is in direct contrast to the heavier rectilinear gates found in other entrances to the park. Although much admired, it was described as \\"hideous\\" by architect Zaha Hadid.From the archives, 1995 ‚Äî Lunch with the FT: Zaha Hadid by Lucy Kellaway Financial Times 18 November 1995 Another architect, Richard Rogers, described it as \\"romantic candyfloss\\"\\", and Viscount Linley, a grandson of the Queen Mother's, was reported as saying that he \\"absolutely loathed\\" the work. The then arts minister, Lord St John of Fawsley, said they were \\"full of joy, strength and courage, like the personage in whose honour they have been created\\". There were also initial concerns that the metal was rusting due to a misunderstanding of the nature of the gate's colouring which was in fact a deliberate creation of chromium oxides with the application of heat. This treatment has since proved to be extremely durable thanks to the initial intensifying of the chromium content on the surface by the use of electro- polishing References Gates in England Buildings and structures in Hyde Park, London Cultural infrastructure completed in 1993 Sculptures of lions Unicorns ","title":"Queen Elizabeth Gate"},{"id":"36561771","text":"Redyko≈Çka is a type of cheese produced in the Podhale region of Poland.

He was captured in 1970, tried and condemned to the death penalty. On 15 January 1971, he was publicly executed in Bafoussam. Early years Ernest Ouandi√© was born in 1924 in Badoumla, Bana district in Haut-Nkam in a Bamil√©k√© family. He attended public school in Bafoussam, and then l'Ecole Primaire Sup√©rieure de Yaound√© where he obtained a Dipl√¥me des Moniteurs Indig√®nes (DMI) in November 1943 and began work as a teacher. In 1944 he joined the Union of Confederate Trade-Unions of Cameroon, affiliated with the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT). From 1944 to 1948, Ernest Ouandi√© taught at Ed√©a. On 7 October 1948, he was posted to Dschang. A month later, he was posted to Douala as director of the New-Bell Bamil√©k√© public school. In 1948 Ouandi√© became a member of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (Union des Populations du Cameroun ‚Äì UPC), a left-wing pro-independence political party. He was elected vice-president of the UPC four years later. In September 1953 he was assigned to Doum√© and Yoko in Mbam-et-Kim. In December 1954 he was posted to Batouri, then Bertoua. Finally, in January 1955 he was assigned to Douala again. He attended the World Congress of Democratic Youth in China in December 1954, and also travelled to Paris and Moscow. Guerilla Fighter In April and May 1955 the UPC held a series of militant meetings, circulated pamphlets and organised strikes. On 20 June 1955 the UPC leader, Ruben Um Nyob√©, was sentenced in his absence to six months in prison and a large fine. On 13 July 1955 the French government of Edgar Faure dissolved the UPC by decree. Most of the UPC leaders moved to Kumba in the British-administered Southern Cameroons to avoid being jailed by the colonial power. Armed revolution broke out in Cameroon. Ruben Um Nyob√© remained in the French zone in the forest near his home village of Boumny√©bel, where he had taken refuge in April 1955. This village lies just east of the Sanaga-Maritime area of the Littoral province on the road connecting Ed√©a to Yaound√©, the capital. The UPC nationalist rebels conducted a fierce struggle against the French, who fought back equally ruthlessly. The insurgents were forced to take refuge in the swamps and forests. Ruben Um Nyob√© was cornered in the Sanaga-Maritime area and killed on 13 September 1958. The western part of Cameroon. Much of the guerilla activity took part in the Ouest/West and Littoral provinces. Ouandi√© had taken refuge in Kumba in 1956. In July 1957, under pressure from the French, the British authorities in western Cameroon deported Ernest Ouandi√© and other leaders of the UPC to Khartoum, Sudan. He then moved in turn to Cairo, Egypt, to Conakry, Guinea and finally to Accra, Ghana. After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, UPC rebels who had been fighting the French colonial government continued to fight the government of President Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom they considered to be a puppet of the French. Ahidjo had asked the French to lend troops to keep the peace during and after the transition to democracy. Led by General Max Briand, who had served previously in Algeria and Indochina, these troops conducted a pacification campaign in the Bamil√©k√© territory of the West, Centre and Littoral provinces. The campaign featured human rights abuses from all sides. During the UPC insurrection against both the French and Cameroonians, most sources place the death toll in the tens of thousands.Johnson, Willard R. 1970. The Cameroon Federation; political integration in a fragmentary society. Princeton: Princeton University Press.The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)\\"WHPSI\\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor Some sources go higher and place the death toll in the hundreds of thousands. In 1960 Ouandi√©, F√©lix-Roland Moumi√©, Abel Kingu√© and other UPC leaders were exiled, isolated and desperate. The UPC leadership was increasingly involved in factional squabbles, out of touch with what was happening in Cameroon. Moumi√© was poisoned by French agents using thallium on 13 October 1960 and died on 4 November 1960, leaving Ouandi√© as head of the UPC. On 1 May 1961 the military tribunal in Yaound√© condemned Oaundi√© and Abel Kingu√© (in their absence) to deportation. That year Ouandi√© returned secretly from Accra to Cameroon to work towards the overthrow of the Ahidjo regime. The Southern Cameroons (now the Southwest and Northwest regions) gained independence from the British and joined a loose federation with East Cameroon on 1 October 1961. Abel Kingu√© died in Cairo on 16 June 1964, leaving Ouandi√© the last member of the original leadership. President Ahidjo declared that Ouandi√© was public enemy number one. Led by Ouandi√©, guerrilla warfare against the Ahidjo regime by the Arm√©e de lib√©ration nationale Kamerounaise (ANLK) continued throughout the 1960s, with the zones of activity gradually becoming depopulated and the guerrilla numbers slowly dwindling. The rebel leader Tankeu No√© was captured and executed. In January 1964, public executions of fifteen captured rebels were staged in Douala, Bafoussam and Ed√©a as part of the celebrations of the fourth anniversary of independence. Meanwhile, the UPC members in exile were locked in a power struggle that caused Ouandi√© and his maquis to increasingly fear betrayal, while the government used the fear of the rebel forces to justify increasing the security forces occupying the Bamil√©k√© towns and villages. The guerrillas lived a hunted life and were often short of food. A surviving member of the rebel force said that they did not do much fighting except in the kitchen. Capture and execution Albert Ndongmo, also a Bamil√©k√©, was made Bishop of Nkongsamba in 1964 in a diocese contained within the zone of guerrilla operations. By Ndongmo's account, in 1965 President Ahmadou Ahidjo asked him to try to mediate with Ouandi√© to try to end the fighting. In the following years Ndongmo had a series of meetings with the rebels. In 1970 Ouandi√© called for help, and Ndongmo picked him up in his car and took him to his own house, where he let him stay for several nights. Ndongmo claimed that his actions were consistent with President Ahidjo's instructions, but it seems clear that he sympathised strongly with the rebels although he did not approve of their methods. Ndongmo was called to go to Rome to answer some questions about business dealings, but before leaving he sent Ouandi√© and his secretary to take refuge with his catechist on the outskirts of Mbanga. The catechist refused to accept Oaundie, and alerted the police. Ouandi√© and the secretary went on the run, but were in unfamiliar territory and were hunted by the local people as well as the police. Disagreeing over directions, they parted company. Ouandi√© tried to hide in the banana plantations, even under bridges, but was hopelessly lost. On 19 August 1970 Ouandi√© surrendered to the authorities near the town of Loum. Exhausted, thirsty, hungry and disoriented, he had asked a passer-by for help. The man recognised him and led him towards a nearby gendarmerie. When they neared the building and Ouandi√© recognised his situation, he abandoned his guide and simply walked into the post and told them who he was. At first the officers panicked and fled, but then returned and called for help. Ouandi√© was taken by helicopter to Yaound√© and imprisoned. Ndongmo was arrested when he returned from Rome. On 29 August the Cameroon Times ran a lead story titled \\"Bishop Ndongmo arrested for alleged subversion.\\" The paper also reported that Ouandie had given in to government forces. The reporter, editor and publisher of the paper were arrested, tried and convicted by a military tribunal on charges of publishing false information. The court said that the term \\"give in\\" could be taken to mean that the government was unable to catch Ouandi√©, which would tend to undermine and ridicule the government. The court said that he had been captured. Ouandi√© was tried in December 1970 and condemned to death. He was executed by firing squad on 15 January 1971 at Bafoussam. In France, most of the major media (AFP, Le Monde...) reproduce without hindsight the version presented by Ahmadou Ahidjo's government. On the other hand, Henri Curiel's Solidarity network is very active, mobilising lawyers and intellectuals to try to organise the legal and media defence of the accused, and approaching French diplomats to convince them to intervene. An International Committee for the Defence of Ernest Ouandi√© is formed, chaired by the naturalist Theodore Monod. Despite the lack of interest from the media, several personalities joined the committee: former minister Pierre Cot, writer Michel Leiris, philosopher Paul Ric≈ìur and linguist Noam Chomsky. In the Thomson-CSF plant in Villacoublay, dozens of workers have signed a petition of support.Thomas Deltombe, Manuel Domergue, Jacob Tatsita, Kamerun !, La D√©couverte, 2019 Legacy Bishop Ndongmo was also tried for treason by a military tribunal in January 1971, found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. However, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he was sent to a prison camp in Tchollir√©. Ndongmo was pardoned in 1976 on condition that he leave the country. In January 1991 on the weekend following the 20th anniversary of Ouandi√©'s death there were moves by opposition groups to lay flowers on the place where he had died. The Governor of Western Province told the population to remain at home, troops were placed on alert and security stepped up throughout Bafoussam, particularly around the place where Ouandi√©'s was executed. According to one account, \\"The forces of law and order, alerted by the gathering crowds, descended on the site, dispersing the crowd and seizing the bouquets of flowers. [Some people] were arrested by soldiers and taken to the office of the provincial Governor; there they were interrogated.\\" After a change of policy, on 16 December 1991 Ouandi√© was declared a national hero by the parliament of Cameroon. In January 2012 the reconstituted Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) protested that Ouandi√©'s grave had been desecrated. The UPC recalled that he had been designated a National Hero by the act of 1991, and said some minimum level of security should have been provided for his grave. The grave was untended and the right side of the tomb was broken. However, it is possible that the damage to the tomb had been done by Ouandi√©'s family in a ritual common to that part of the country.

This shape is a single wave along the pattern, for real LEWPs this shape is tessellated repeatedly in a linear fashion A line echo wave pattern (LEWP) is a weather radar formation in which a single line of thunderstorms presenting multiple bow echoes forms south (or equatorward) of a mesoscale low-pressure area with a rotating \\"head\\". LEWP often are associated with a multiple-bow serial derecho and often produce tornadoes, some of which can be strong. The existence of a LEWP on radar means that a serial derecho has developed or is likely to develop soon, much as a hook echo indicates the same for a tornado.  Formation  A LEWP, according to the NWS, is defined as \\"a squall line that has developed into a wave-like pattern due to acceleration at one end of the line and deceleration along the portion immediately adjacent.\\" very large derecho A LEWP is an extension of the concept of the bow echo, which usually indicates a powerful convective windstorm. Areas hit by the apices of bows often see the worst weather, with the highest winds and very heavy rain. However, if the sides of the bows reach enough of an orientation parallel to the derecho's movement, a very long- duration heavy rain event can result, leading to flash flooding. A serial derecho can be in the form of a LEWP or a single, very large bow echo. In theory, a LEWPs formation is dependent on varying environmental conditions in different regions of the respective LEWP. In many LEWPs, outflow induced winds behind the leading edge tend to influence this edge, appearing as a bulge in reflectivity on radar. Another conditional scenario is varying amounts of shear parallel and along the line.http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Line_echo_wave_pattern  See also  * Derecho * Hook echo * Convective storm detection * Mesoscale convective system (MCS) and mesoscale convective complex (MCC) * Mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) and mesolow * Rear-inflow jet (RIJ) References Radar meteorology Severe weather and convection fr:Grain en arc#Arcs multiples ","title":"Line echo wave pattern"},{"id":"36561885","text":"Sheriff of Clark County, officially The Sheriff of the County of Clark, is the chief law enforcement officer of Clark County, Nevada.

It is bounded in the west by the town of Dessau, in the north by the Elbe valley (Wittenberg, Pretzsch), in the southeast by Torgau, in the south by Eilenburg and the course of the Mulde through Bad D√ºben and Bitterfeld. The D√ºben Heath is a terminal moraine landscape formed during the Saale glaciation (Plateau of Gr√§fenhainichen- Schmiedeberg) with predominantly sandy soils. Beneath this Pleistocene cover lie lignite-bearing strata. The majority of the D√ºben Heath is covered by forest. The eastern part of the D√ºben Heath, with the resort of Bad D√ºben, is designated as a nature park. In the western part around Gr√§fenhainichen and Bitterfeld, lignite was extracted until the end of the 1980s in open pits; as a result large areas of the natural woodland landscape were destroyed. Since then, the pits have been remediated and the hollows with water. In the vicinity of Gr√§fenhainichen on a peninsula in the flooded Ferropolis open pit a museum of technology has been established, where open pit mining equipment and railway vehicles are displayed. The dialects spoken in the D√ºben Heath in former times were as different as the landscape of the heath is varied. These dialects are sub-groups of the Upper Saxon German dialect, which is one of the central German languages. The development of these dialects was a result of several settlement phases, shaped by the borders of different domains and foreign influences. With the settlement of displaced persons from the former eastern territories of Germany in the late 1940s, the migration of labour, the influence of literature, press, radio and television, the dialects of the D√ºben Heath are now hardly spoken.

The name Bathou (Ba=five; thou=deep) in Bodo means five principles.\\"The meaning of the term ‚ÄòBathou ‚Äô is five deep principle of creation.\\" The five principles are: bar (air), orr (fire), ha (earth), dwi (water) and okhrang (ether).\\"...five ingredients of earth, water, air, fire and ether {ha, dwi, bar, or and okhrang). The chief deity, called Bathoubwrai (bwarai: \\"the Elder\\")--omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent--is said to have created the five principles. Though there are other minor gods and goddesses, Bathoubwrai is considered the Supreme God. Bathoubwrai is unseen. The second most important deity is Mainao, the consort of Bathoubwrai, who is considered as the \\"protector of the rice fields\\". It is reported that Bathouism will be included in the Indian census. Sijou plant The sijou plant, a woody species of (Euphorbia)\\"The Bathouism or Bathou is symbolised by the Sijou plant is considered the living embodiment of Bathoubwrai. Families that follow Bathouism plant a sijou shrub at the northeast corner of their courtyard, in an altar called sijousali. Bodo communities that follow Bathouism generally plant a sijou shrub at a community land, fenced with eighteen pairs of bamboo strips with five fastenings. Each pair symbolizes a pair of minor god-goddess. The five fastenings signify, from bottom: birth, pain, death, marriage and peace/pleasure. The bottom three fastenings, called bando, are those that one cannot escape in life; whereas the top two one could. Gods, goddesses and gurus differentiates between household gods and community gods. Of the household gods Bathoubwrai, Mainao, Song Bwrai/Burai and Bura Bagh Raja are considered prominent. The practice of representing Bathoubwrai by the sijou tree was more common among Boros(or Mech) of Goalpara region, and less so in Darrang. Song Raja is usually represented inside the house in an altar called dham, a deity who obtains devotion from women, and receives offerings during women's menses; but these offerings are eventually brought out and laid at the sijou tree representing Bathou. The eighteen pairs of gods-goddesses are: 1 Mwnsinsin bwrai-Mwnsinsin burwi, 2 Si Bwrai-Si Burwi, 3 Aham Bwrai-Aham Burwi, 4 Khuria Bwrai-Khuria Burwi, 5 Eheo Bwrai-Eheo Burwi 6 Mainao Bwrai-Mainao-Burwi, 7 Bwlli Bwrai-Bwlli Burwi, 8 Deva Bwrai-Devi Burwi, 9 Gongar Bwrai-Gongar Burwi, 10 Joumwn Bwrai-Joumwn Burwi, 11 Song Raja-Song Rani, 12 Hasung Bwrai-Hasung Burwi, 13 Rajong Bwrai-Rajong burwi, 14 Agrang Bwrai-Agrang Burwi, 15 Hazw Bwrai-Hazw Burwi, 16. Emao Bwrai-Emao Burwi 17. Mohela Bwrai-Mohela Burwi and 18. Hafao Bwrai-Hafao Burwi. Worship =Traditional= Traditional Bathouism did not have any written scripture or religious book, nor temples. The worship is performed at the sijousali, and constituted offering animals and fowls for sacrifice and rice beer. Notable religious festivals were Kherai, Garja and others. These ceremonies are performed by priests called Douri (male priest) and Doudini (female priest). This religion was not organized. =Revivalism/Reformation= All Bathou Religious Union, an organization, was constituted in 1992; and it has begun reviving and reforming the traditional religion. The traditional role of the Douri and Doudini are replaced by the Gwthari Asari appointed by the organization, and a band of singers who sing in a practice called Bathou Aroj. The construction of temples, resembling churches or mosques called Thansali, have come into being. Bathou aroj is performed on Tuesdays in Thansalis. Sacrifices of animals and fowls, and offering of rice beer as modes of worship has been replaced by offering of flowers, fruits and the burning of incense. The partaking of prasad has also become popular.

Since its establishment in 1972, the HHD has had boundary adjustments in 1990 and 1993. The original 1972 designation was composed of two unconnected sections known as \\"Downtown\\" and \\"West Residential\\".  Downtown section  Placer Hotel and Securities Building, downtown Helena Helena was initially founded in the downtown section. On July 14, 1864 four miners, dubbed the \\"Four Georgians\\" (though only one was from Georgia), discovered gold in a creekbed along what today is Helena's downtown main street, Last Chance Gulch. This sparked a cultural and building boom that lasted 30 years and Helena became the state capital. The city grew from south to north along Last Chance Gulch, its main street, and hence the evolution of architectural styles can be traced. At the southern end the road is narrow with small log and stone buildings and at the northern end the road is wider and has large stonework homes. Few major downtown buildings were built in the years immediately after the Panic of 1893, which among other problems, caused the closing of the local silver mines. This resulted in downtown Helena having a sharp division in its older and newer sections. Most of the newer buildings were small, had a single function, and had a false front. At the time of the initial 1972 NRHP nomination, some of the significant buildings that still stood from that early time were: the Electric and Power Blocks, Helena Athletic Association, Auerbach Buildings, Merchants Hotel (later Monticello Apartments), Atlas Block, Diamond Block, the Wheat Building (Merchants National Bank Building) and the Lewis and Clark County Courthouse. A major fire in 1928 affected the area, destroying many original buildings, including the Granite, Bailey, Gold, and New York Store blocks. Additional buildings in the downtown section were damaged or destroyed in the 1935 Helena earthquake. Helena's early commercial district was located along State, Edwards, and Broadway Streets, but fires destroyed much of this area in 1869, 1872, and 1874. Much of what was built afterwards was built in the Western Commercial style, with splendid brickwork and simple lines. The Beaux Arts Parchen Drug Building, Colwell Building, and the Penn-Block Bristol Hotel were French Renaissance. The Denver Block and Sands Brothers Dry Goods were Romanesque Revival. By the mid-1880s at least 18 architectural firms had been established in Helena or called in from back East. Several of these architects were part of or influenced by the Chicago school of architecture. This influence is seen in the Atlas Building, Securities Building, Power Block, and the Lewis and Clark County Courthouse. The most significant changes to the area occurred in the early 1970s, when a major urban renewal project demolished about 240 buildings within the original Helena Historic District--61 of them were of historical significance. Most of these buildings were commercial in nature and were concentrated in the southeastern section of the district. The architectural and historical building survey initiated prior to the project was later deemed incomplete, and the decision to destroy many buildings of \\"indisputable historic and architectural significance\\" created significant controversy in the community. Urban renewal was viewed by many locals as a \\"disaster\\" equal to the 1935 earthquake, as many \\"insipid\\" new buildings were put on in the place of demolished historic structures. However, many historically significant buildings are still standing today including the Atlas block, the Securities building, the Placer Hotel, the Iron Front hotel and the Montana Club.  West Residential section  T.C. Power Mansion, within the residential section The West Residential section is located on the lower slopes of Mount Helena, west of the downtown area. The streets in this section are lined with trees and stone walls, and many homes date from the last quarter of the 19th century. Mansions in this section include those once owned by United States Senator Thomas C. Power, B. H. Tatum, D. A. G. Floweree, and S. T. Hauser. The architecture of these homes is quite varied.  Urban Renewal and the boundary increase of 1990  When over 240 buildings within the original Helena Historic District were demolished due to urban renewal, the southeastern section where the demolition of the 1970s was the greatest was delisted, and a roughly 5-block area north of the original downtown district was added in 1990. The residential sections boundaries were not altered at that time, although the construction of Cruse Avenue, a wide, modern street intended to be a traffic bypass, split the residential district from the downtown. St. Peter's Episcopal Cathedral and the First Unitarian Church (now Grandstreet Theater) were included in this amended district. The boundary change also resulted in the period of significance being extended from 1900 to 1948 to reflect the significant early 20th century changes to the area. In addition, the south end of Last Chance Gulch was closed off and a pedestrian walking mall was created. Lewis and Clark County Courthouse Historic buildings and areas lost in urban renewal included the razing of 150 buildings in a seven block area and the former Wall street being completely eliminated. This area was infilled with three modern buildings and a park. This demolition also resulted in the loss of west State street and what remained of Helena's Chinatown, the Electric Block, Colwell Building the Helena YMCA, the Novelty Block, Homer block, and the most controversial demolition, the Marlow Theater.  Boundary increase of 1993  Approximately three blocks of mixed commercial and residential buildings centered on North Rodney Street, east of the earlier downtown section, were added to the district in 1993. They represent a period of development from 1878 to 1948. Many of these structures were built in the late 1800s in an effort to move to an area considered safer than those ravaged by the earlier Helena fires. Several commercial structures here were built by members of Helena's Jewish business community. This activity, and the Jewish population peaked in the 1890s, and was halted by the Panic of 1893. Limited construction began again after 1900 and continued slowly for the next few decades, but by 1929, there were no Jewish-owned buildings or residences in the neighborhood.

It is very selective for the CB1 subtype, with a Ki of 0.35nM, >700-fold higher affinity than it has for CB2 receptors. In animal studies, JD5037 does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and thus is not expected to produce the psychiatric side effects in humans which led to the withdrawal of rimonabant from the market. Its antiobesity effects are believed to be mediated by blockade of peripheral CB1 receptors, resulting in decreased leptin expression and secretion and increased leptin clearance by the kidneys. In obese mice given the drug, the resulting resensitization to leptin levels produced decreased food intake, weight loss, and normalized responses to glucose and insulin. JD5037 is covered in the following US Patents issued to Jenrin Discovery: 8,088,809 (1/3/12) ), 7,666,889 (2/23/10), 7,482,470 (1/27/09). The synthesis of JD-5037 and related analogs along with structure activity relationships has been reported. A review on the approaches and compound types being pursued as peripherally restricted CB1 receptor blockers, including JD5037, has been published.  Preclinical Toxicity  A preclinical toxicity study of JD5037 in rats and beagle dogs reported NOAELs in rats (150 mg/kg) and dogs (20 mg/kg in males and 75 mg/kg in females). JD5037 showed non-linear kinetics where high dose levels showed plasma saturation with lower plasma drug concentrations. The plasma concentration (area under the curve, AUC) in dogs that were given free access to food was almost 4.5 times greater compared to the dogs that were fasted prior to dose administration. This indicates that the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract may increase the absorption of JD5037.

The following year, she moved to New York City and attended the New York Studio School, where she studied drawing with Nicolas Carone. Early work Brookner's landscape-scale ecological art evolved from her sculptures and installations from the 1980s and early 1990s. In the early 1980s at Oscarsson Hood Gallery in New York, Brookner exhibited cast bronze sculptures that were based on the movement of water and growth in plants.Nancy Grove, ‚ÄúJackie Brookner,‚Äù Arts Magazine, Vol. 56, #6, Feb, 1982, p. 29 In 1987, she began juxtaposing materials such as soil, velvet, inner tubes, pillow stuffing, exhaust pipes, and chiffon to explore the psychological and gendered associations these materials carried.Suzaan Boettger, ‚ÄúDirt Works,‚Äù Sculpture, Vol.11, #6, Nov-Dec,1992, pp. 40‚Äì41 Soil works In the early 1990s, Brookner's writing focused on how our materialistic culture could be so at war with the matrix of its own matter, the Earth.Jackie Brookner, ed., Art Journal Summer 1993, vol. 51, no.2, pp. 8‚Äì11. Using soil as a metaphor for raw matter in her wall pieces and Soil Chairs, she investigated the cultural associations of dirt, excrement, sex, and death. In her museum installations, Brookner focused on historical relationships of soil in particular regions. =Of Earth and Cotton (1994‚Äì98)= This project traveled from 1994 to 1998 to the following venues: McKissick Museum, Columbia, South Carolina (1994); Diggs Gallery, Winston-Salem State University, North Carolina (1995); The Hunter Museum of Art, Chattanooga, Tennessee (1995); The Columbus Museum, Columbus, Georgia (1995); University of North Texas Art Gallery, Denton, Texas (1996); The National Civil Rights Museum, Memphis, Tennessee (1996); Gallery 210, University of Missouri, St. Louis, Missouri (1998). The project evolved as it crossed the southern U.S. to follow the migration of the Cotton Belt from the Carolinas westward. At each location, Brookner spoke with former cotton farmers who hand-picked cotton in the 1930s and 1940s, as she modeled portraits of their feet with local soil. These became the focal points of installations where they rested on 60-tons of soil or 2,500-pounds of ginned cotton. Accompanying the installation was a video documenting Brookner's conversations and forty Farm Security Administration photographs from the 1930s (selected by Susan Harris Edwards)Susan Harris Edwards, ‚Äúof Earth and Cotton,‚Äù McKissick Museum, University of South Carolina, 1994, exhibition brochure essay depicting the living and working conditions of cotton farmers during the Depression. =Native Tongues, Miro Foundation, Barcelona, Spain (1997)= While listening to the Castillian (Spanish) and Catalan languages, Brookner imagined the shapes of the tongues speaking them. She then sculpted Castillian and Catalan tongues from soils collected in central Spain and Catalonia, respectively. The same soils were used to make a 50-foot wall- drawing based on phonetics diagrams that map where the tongue is placed to make specific sounds.Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥ This sound, sculpture, and drawing installation explored the corporeality of speech in the context of Catalonia where regional languages, prohibited and politicized under Franco's regime, intersect with homeland, territory, and power.Fundacio Juan Miro, Espai 13, Ferran Barenblit, ‚ÄúLlengues natives, Jackie Brookner,‚Äù 1997 Biosculptures Brookner was guest editor of the College Art Association's Art Journal on ‚ÄúArt and Ecology‚Äù (1992). Her research for this issue inspired her to develop a practice that could provide ecological benefits and help transform cultural values. This research led Brookner to develop her Biosculptures: living water filtration systems that unite the conceptual and aesthetic capacities of sculpture with ecological function. These sculpted wetland ecosystems are made of mosses and plants growing on stone and concrete substrates, while the water they filter is inhabited by fish, snails, plants, and other organisms. Together they form a complete ecosystem.Amanda Boetzkes, The Ethics of Contemporary Earth Art, Univ. of Minnesota, 2010, pp. 170‚Äì171 The plants and the bacteria that live in their root zones convert waste and pollutants in the water into food for their own metabolism, demonstrating that in healthy natural systems there is no waste.Thomas W.

Weaver, ‚ÄúSecond Nature,‚Äù catalog for Drip, Blow, Burn/Forces of Nature in Contemporary Art, Hudson River Museum, 1999, p. 15; Jackie Brookner, Urban Rain/Stormwater as Resource, ORO editions, San Rafael, California, 2009, pp. 24‚Äì29. Landscape-scale water projects/creative catalyst Veden Taika (2007‚Äì09) Since 2002, Brookner has been collaborating with ecologists, engineers, policy makers, design professionals, and community residents to create multifunctional water remediation/public art projects. These landscape- scale public projects demonstrate how stormwater and other polluted waters can be reclaimed and used to restore habitat in parks, wetlands, rivers, former sewage treatment lagoons, and other contexts. =The Fargo Project, Fargo, North Dakota (2010-ongoing)= At the time of her death Brookner was working on a pilot project with The City of Fargo, ND, Fargo residents, and local artists to transform an 18-acre stormwater detention basin into a multifunctional neighborhood commons through a process intended to catalyze collective creative agency within Fargo's diverse population. It will include restored prairie and wetland habitats, an orchard, natural play areas, an amphitheater, festival spaces, gathering areas, and community gardens that will feed 50 families. This pilot project will be a model for 19 other neighborhood basins throughout Fargo. =Veden Taika (The Magic of Water), Halikonlahti Bird Pools, Salo, Finland (2007‚Äì09)= Veden Taika consists of three floating islands that provide safe habitat for nesting birds, improve water quality through phytoremediation with native wetland plants and subsurface aeration, and create an aesthetic focal point in a former sewage treatment lagoon. The project was conceived in consultation with local ecologists and artist/project manager Tuula Nikulainen, engineered with Biomatrix Water, and implemented in collaboration with high school students, local artists, local scientists, volunteers, and city agencies. One of the successful goals of the project was to create collaborations between city agencies, who have not worked together before, to provide solutions to local environmental problems.Elina Lahti, ‚ÄúHalikonlahden puhdistava saari alkaa muotoutua,‚Äù Salon Seudun Sanomat, Sept. 28, 2008, pp. 3, 12; http://vedentaika.blogspot.com/ =Urban Rain, Roosevelt Community Center, San Jose, California (2005‚Äì08)= Brookner's work at this LEED gold-certified building captures stormwater runoff from the roof with two sculptural rock filtration systems: the Coyote Creek and Thumbprint Filters. Urban Rain reduces the volume and improves the quality of the water entering into the stormwater sewer system and the Coyote Creek Watershed. The Coyote Creek Filter contextualizes the building itself as a watershed within the larger Coyote Creek watershed and reveals infiltration processes that normally happen underground. The imagery of the Thumbprint Filter is based on the spiral pattern of a real thumbprint, and echoes the spiral eddies of wind, water, and galaxies.Patricia C. Phillips, ‚ÄúTo Give the Appearance,‚Äù Urban Rain/ Stormwater as Resource, p. 59 =Dreher Park Art and Design, West Palm Beach, Florida, with Angelo Ciotti (2003‚Äì04)= Brookner and Ciotti were part of the design team to enhance water flow, flood control systems, and recreational facilities for the redesign of Dreher Park.Interview about EcoArt South Florida ¬´ The Center for Sustainable Practice in the Arts They conceived the Elders‚Äô Cove landscape complex to feature the then-underutilized Northern section of the park.Elders' Cove Elders‚Äô Cove includes a 14-foot Biosculpture in one of the new detention ponds, a viewing and fishing dock, wetland habitats, mounds that reclaim and sculpt soil from the lake excavations, and a gathering area that draws on the area's Seminole history.South Florida EcoArtists/EcoArt ¬ª EcoArt South Florida =Laughing Brook, Salway Park, Cincinnati, Ohio (2002‚Äì09)= This project consists of over 100 Biosculptures in constructed wetlands that treat stormwater runoff from 3 acres of ballfields and parking lots to lessen pollutant impact on the adjacent endangered Mill Creek. The stormwater, collected in a 10,000-gallon underground cistern, irrigates the Biosculptures. The water cycles repeatedly through the wetland until the next large rainfall, when it is released into the creek.Groundwork Cincinnati - Mill Creek - Freedom Trees The entire system is solar powered. The Biosculptures are shaped like hands that gradually transform into six species of fish that would inhabit the river if it were healthy. Brookner collaborated with the Mill Creek Restoration Project and Human Nature Landscape Architects, local artists, high school students, and other volunteers to build, plant, and maintain the project. =Art and Community Landscapes (2002‚Äì03)= Brookner and Susan Steinman were selected to be artists in residence with the National Park Service Rivers and Trails Conservation Assistance program through a National Endowment for the Arts and National Park Service partnership called ‚ÄúArt and Community Landscapes.‚Äù Working with three towns, Tillamook, Oregon, Puyallup, Washington, and Caldwell, Idaho, to build communities of support for local creek daylighting and trail projects, they created concept plans and guided public ecological art projects. They also started annual river celebrations that continue today and fostered many new partnerships between different interest groups in each city.Ann Rosenthal, ‚ÄùImagination Can Save Us,‚Äù New Practices, New Pedagogies, ed. Malcolm Miles, Routledge, 2005, pp. 79‚Äì83 =The Gift of Water, Grossenhain, Germany (2001)= This Biosculpture is part of a wetland pond that provides natural filtration for a large public swimming complex used daily by over 1,500 people. Two large moss-covered hands reach from the bank of the wetland into the pond, cupping the water in which they are immersed.e c o v e n t i o n Teaching Brookner taught at the University of Pennsylvania,Bios of Presenters  Making, Meaning, and Context: A Radical Reconsideration of Art‚Äôs WorkMaking, Meaning, and Context: A Radical Reconsideration of Art‚Äôs Work Harvard University,Art in the Yard  Arts  The Harvard Crimson Bard College, the New York Studio School, and Parsons The New School for Design,Parsons where she continued to teach until her death.

History The Carriage House In 1879, John Alexander Paxton, a wealthy San Franciscan, bought of land in the Dry Creek Valley area for $10,500. He named this property, just west of Healdsburg, \\"Madrona Knoll Rancho\\" as the word \\"Madrona\\" is the local term for an Arbutus species, notably the distinctive small tree Arbutus menziesii. In 1880‚Äì1881, he built a 17-room, three-story gabled mansion on the property, to which he commuted on weekends from his work in the city. Paxton died in 1888, leaving 1/4 of his estate to his sister-in-law Mary McClellan, 9/16 to his wife, Hannah McClellan Paxton, and 3/16 to his second son, Charles. He disinherited his eldest son, Blitz, due to disappointment. After Hannah died in 1902, the estate was neglected. Charles died in 1910, leaving Blitz to administer the property. He subdivided the land, and sold along with the buildings to D. H. Botchford in 1918 for $17,500. In 1981, the property (then down to eight acres) was turned from a family residence into a country inn by new owner John Harry Muir. The Manor was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 2 April 1987. Bill and Trudi Konrad purchased the Manor in 1999. In 2006 it was briefly reported that Francis Ford Coppola had purchased the mansion, but a few weeks later the Konrads announced that they could not reach an agreement. Lodging The inn has 23 guest rooms and suites, some of which are in the Carriage House (also built in 1880) and private cottages. The grounds are a popular location for weddings and weekend getaways from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Restaurant Muir had used his children as chefs, but in 1999 the Konrads brought in Jesse Mallgren to run their restaurant. Since then, he has become one of the area's finest chefs, culminating in the restaurant being awarded a Michelin star in 2008. Begun during Muir's ownership, and continuing to the present day, are the annual \\"Dickens Dinners.\\" The November and December dinners feature entertainment along with traditional holiday dishes made with local seasonal ingredients.

The son of the emirate's founder, Sayf al-Dawla, he inherited the throne at a young age and in the midst of a major Byzantine offensive that within two years conquered the western portions of his realm and turned Aleppo into a tributary state. Facing a multitude of rebellions and desertions until 977, Sa'd was unable even to enter his own capital, which was in the hands of his father's chief minister, Qarquya. By maintaining close relations with the Buyids, he managed to re-establish his authority in parts of the Jazira, but his rule was soon challenged by the rebellion of his governor Bakjur, who was supported by the Fatimids of Egypt. In turn, Sa'd came to rely increasingly on Byzantine assistance, although he continued to fluctuate in his allegiance between Byzantium, the Buyids, and the Fatimids.  Biography  = Early years = Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty Sa'd al-Dawla was the son of Sayf al- Dawla, the first Emir of Aleppo, and Sakhinah, the sister of Sayf al-Dawla's cousin and court poet, Abu Firas. At the time of his father's death, in February 967, he was only fifteen, and resided at the emirate's Jaziran capital, Mayyafariqin.Canard (1971), p. 129El Tayib (1990), p. 326 His succession to the emirate was unopposed, but the state his father had left him was crumbling: the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II had just conquered Cilicia and was raiding its northern and western provinces, while rebellions of his closest lieutenants had plagued Sayf al-Dawla's last years.Kennedy (2004), pp. 277‚Äì280 Sa'd al-Dawla reached Aleppo, which for years had been governed by Sayf al-Dawla's chief minister and chamberlain (hajib), Qarquya, in June/July 967. Almost immediately he was confronted by a rebellion of his uncle, Abu Firas, at the time governor of Homs, which lasted until the latter's death in battle in April 968. At the same time, Aleppo itself was threatened by the Byzantines, and Sa'd al-Dawla, on the advice of Qarquya, left the city. The Byzantines did not attack the city, but Qarquya and his fellow ghilman (military slaves) seized the moment to claim the city for themselves. Accompanied by 300 faithful followers, Sa'd al-Dawla was thus reduced to wandering from city to city across the lands that were nominally his, hoping to gain entry: Saruj, Manbij and Harran refused to support him, while at Mayyafariqin his own mother refused to let him in. Finally, he found refuge at Homs.Kennedy (2004), p. 280 In the meantime, many of his father's old supporters left to join his cousin Abu Taghlib, Emir of Mosul, who used the opportunity to expand his own territory. Immediately after Sayf al-Dawla's death, he captured Raqqa, and by 971 extended his control over the provinces of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar. Sa'd al-Dawla, unable to offer any resistance, tacitly accepted these losses as well as his cousin's suzerainty.Canard (1971), pp. 127‚Äì128, 129 The year 969 was a crucial one in Syrian history, as it marked the climax of the Byzantine advance. In October, the generals Michael Bourtzes and Peter captured Antioch, securing their control over the north Syrian littoral. Soon after, the Byzantines marched against Aleppo itself and forced Qarquya to sign a treaty (December 969 or January 970) making Aleppo a tributary Byzantine protectorate with Qarquya as emir and his deputy, Bakjur, as his designated successor. At the same time, in Egypt, the Fatimids defeated the Ikhshidids and gained control of the country, from where they advanced into southern Syria. The competition between these two powers, Byzantium and the Fatimids, would shape the history of Syria and of Aleppo for the next fifty years. = Recovery of Aleppo, conflicts with Bakjur, the Fatimids and Byzantium = It was not until 977 that Sa'd al-Dawla managed to regain his capital, which by now was under the control of Bakjur, who in 975 had deposed and imprisoned Qarquya. Aided by some of his father's ghilman, and, crucially, the powerful Banu Kilab tribe living around Aleppo, Sa'd al- Dawla besieged Aleppo and captured it. Qarquya was set free and again entrusted with the affairs of state until his death a few years later, while Bakjur was given the governorship of Homs.Kennedy (2004), pp. 280‚Äì281Stevenson (1926), p. 250 Soon after, in 979, he was able to capitalize upon Abu Taghlib's conflict with the Buyids of Iraq to recover some of his father's domains in the Jazira: after acknowledging Buyid suzerainty, he received governorship of the Diyar Mudar, except for Raqqa and Rahba. At the same time, he also received from the Abbasid Caliph‚Äîwho was a puppet of the Buyids‚Äîthe honorific laqab by which he is known.Canard (1971), p. 130 Bakjur, in the meantime, had used his new post at Homs to open contacts with the Fatimids, who intended to use him as a pawn to subdue Aleppo and complete their conquest of the entirety of Syria. Sa'd al-Dawla himself oscillated between the Fatimids and Byzantium: on the one hand he resented Byzantine overlordship and was willing to acknowledge the Fatimid Caliph, but on the other hand he did not want to see his domain become merely another Fatimid province like southern Syria. His first attempt to shake free of the Byzantine protectorate, in 981, thus ended in failure due to lack of outside support, when a Byzantine army appeared before Aleppo's walls to enforce compliance. The Fatimids now induced Bakjur to act, and in September 983, the latter launched an attack on Aleppo with the support of Fatimid troops. Sa'd al-Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor Basil II for help, and the siege was raised by a Byzantine army under Bardas Phokas the Younger. The Byzantines then proceeded to sack Homs in October. The city was returned to Hamdanid control, while Bakjur fled to Fatimid territory, where he assumed the governorship of Damascus.Kennedy (2004), p. 281Whittow (1996), p. 367 It is an indication of the strained relations between Sa'd al-Dawla and his \\"saviours\\" that after Bakjur's flight, there were clashes between Byzantine and Hamdanid troops, which were settled only when the Hamdanid emir agreed to pay twice the usual yearly amount of tribute of 20,000 gold dinars. Hamdanid relations with Byzantium collapsed completely in 985‚Äì986, after the Fatimids took the Byzantine fortress of Balanyas. Sa'd al-Dawla refused to continue paying tribute. As a result, the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas invaded his territory and sacked Killis before retracing their steps and marching south to an unsuccessful siege of Apamea (Qalaat al-Madiq). In retaliation, Sa'd al-Dawla sent his troops to raze the famous monastery of Qal'at Sim'an.Whittow (1996), pp. 367‚Äì368 However, soon after that, in May 986, the prospect of an imminent conclusion of a peace between Byzantium and Egypt forced Sa'd al-Dawla to return to his earlier allegiance, and he re-affirmed his tributary status on the same terms as before. This did not prevent Sa'd al-Dawla from supporting the Byzantine general Bardas Skleros in his second rebellion against Basil II, once he was released from Buyid captivity in December 986, nor of recognizing Fatimid suzerainty in the same month, especially as Byzantium now descended into a civil war that lasted until 989.Whittow (1996), pp. 369‚Äì373 Warfare with the Fatimids once again threatened in 991, again because of Bakjur. He had governed Damascus until 988, when he was deposed, and then fled to Raqqa. From there, though with little support from the Fatimids, he tried to attack Aleppo. Sa'd al-Dawla, with Byzantine assistance in the form of troops under the doux of Antioch, Michael Bourtzes, was able to defeat and capture Bakjur at Na'ura east of Aleppo in April 991, and later had him executed.Stevenson (1926), pp. 250‚Äì251Whittow (1996), pp. 379‚Äì380 Nevertheless, relations with the Fatimids soured over Sa'd al-Dawla's arrest of Bakjur's children, and it was only his death from hemiplegia in December 991 that stopped him from attacking Fatimid possessions. Sa'd al-Dawla was succeeded by his son, Sa'id Abu 'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla, but real power rested in the hands of Sa'd al- Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu'. Several of the Hamdanid ghilman, resenting the influence of Lu'lu', went over to the Fatimids, who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin. Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's continued existence as a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in 1002, Lu'lu' assassinated Sa'id al-Dawla and assumed control of Aleppo in his own name.Stevenson (1926), pp. 251‚Äì252Whittow (1996), pp. 379‚Äì381  References   Bibliography   * 991 deaths 10th-century rulers in Asia Hamdanid emirs of Aleppo Arab people of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Syrian Shia Muslims Year of birth unknown 10th- century Arabs Sayf al-Dawla ","title":"Sa'd al-Dawla"},{"id":"36562600","text":"Geshn () is a village in Bayg Rural District, Bayg District, Torbat-e Heydarieh County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

He was proposed in 1816 as a possible Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata by deputies of the Congress of Tucum√°n, but Jos√© de San Mart√≠n feared that his strong feud with Buenos Aires may break national unity, and opposed his candidacy.Galasso, pp. 166-167 References Bibliography * 1785 births 1824 deaths People of the Argentine War of Independence ","title":"Jos√© Moldes"},{"id":"36562722","text":"Sorkhabad (, also Romanized as SorkhƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Bayg Rural District, Bayg District, Torbat-e Heydarieh County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

Film The Hindenburg is a 1975 film about the disaster. Although much of the storyline is fictional, they were based on real bomb threats before the flight began, as well as proponents of the sabotage theory. Hindenburg is a 2011 made-for-TV film starring Maximillian Simonischek, Lauren Lee Smith, Stacy Keach and Greta Scacchi. It was initially aired on RTL dubbed in German as a two-part series and later released as a DVD in English. It was aired in US in 2013 on Encore. Similar to the 1975 film, it focuses on the sabotage theory, though much of the storyline is completely fictional. The 2015 film The Dust Storm includes a song called Hindenburg - a reference to the disaster. Literature In the Neal Stephenson novel Cryptonomicon the fictional character Lawrence Waterhouse is atop a fire tower in the Pine Barrens when he is \\"distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast.\\" Upon reaching the scene the author describes a disjointed scene of news reporters, an intense fire, people carrying charred bodies onto stretchers, and \\"a rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers.\\" Lawrence Waterhouse returns to the campsite and remarks, \\"Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.\\" In the 2001 novel Passage by Connie Willis, the Hindenburg disaster is referred to at length, as the favorite disaster of Maisie, a little girl with heart problems and a passion for famous disasters, in the hospital where Dr. Joanna Lander, the main character, is investigating near-death experiences. Love and Hydrogen, by Jim Shepard, deals with two crew men aboard the Hindenburg, Meinert and Gn√ºss, and their hidden love. The story takes place a day before the explosion and the moment of. In book three of The Pendragon Adventures by D. J. MacHale: The Never War, the Hindenburg disaster is the major event to change first earth. The Travelers eventually realize that the Hindenburg disaster must happen to prevent larger disasters such as an atomic bomb dropped on the U.S. In The Martian by Andy Weir, during The Great Hydrogen Scare of Sol 37, Watney states how the Hab is his private Hindenburg, ready to explode. A son, Henning Bo√´tius, of one of the ship's officers, wrote a novel, The Phoenix. The novel is based on accounts Henning's father gave of the disaster. Music Blues musician Lead Belly wrote a song titled, \\"The Hindenburg Disaster\\" (1937). This song can be heard on the record Leadbelly: The Library of Congress Recordings, recorded by John A.

The cover of Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut album shows a stylized photo of the Hindenburg disaster with the band's name in the upper left corner. The band's name is a reference to a popular catchphrase that refers to something, such as a joke, that falls flat; \\"That went over like a lead zeppelin.\\" The band changed the spelling of \\"lead\\" to \\"led\\" so that it wouldn't be confused with \\"lead\\" as in a \\"lead singer\\" or \\"lead guitar\\". The song \\"The Blimp\\" by Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band as issued on their 1969 Straight Records album Trout Mask Replica is a parody of Morrison's live description of the disaster as aired on radio the following day. The satirical song \\"Smash Flop Hits\\" by Phil Ochs includes a verse about the Hindenburg disaster. The song, \\"From The Sky\\", by Protest The Hero (Palimpsest, 2020) uses the disaster as an allegory for the glorification of historical events despite society's selective memory of details that do not fit the desired narrative.https://exclaim.ca/music/article/protest_the_hero_palimpsest_album_review Television In season 1, episode 4 of Entourage, Ari suggests to Vince that his next movie should be Hindenburg, stating that \\"It's like Titanic on a blimp.\\" No further reference is made in the episode. In season 2, episode 17 of Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction, the twist at the end of \\"Bon Voyage\\" reveals that the story has been taking place on the Hindenburg moments before the crash. At the end of the episode, the story was revealed to be fictional. Seinfeld made at least two references to the disaster. At the end of the episode \\"The Pothole\\", Newman's mail truck erupts into flames (after a series of events caused by Kramer), causing him to cry out, \\"Oh, the humanity!\\" The episode \\"The Puerto Rican Day\\" features a subplot in which George attempts to deliver a comical line (\\"That's gotta hurt!\\") during the fiery climax of the (fictional) film Blimp: The Hindenburg Story. In The Sopranos episode, \\"Kaisha\\", Phil Leotardo notes the disappearance of Fat Dom Gamiello, and surmises that the Sopranos family killed Dom because he was last seen in New Jersey. Tony Soprano denies that claim, emphasizing the lack of evidence to support it, and adds: \\"The Hindenburg was last seen in New Jersey, too\\". In the 1996 episode of The Simpsons, \\"Bart the Fink\\", Bart receives a cheque book depicting the Hindenburg disaster. In Rescue Me's first season episode \\"Kansas\\", Sean Garrity learns about the Hindenburg disaster after his crew made fun of him for not knowing what it was. The Hindenburg disaster is chronicled in the popular 1970s television drama, The Waltons where John Boy Walton wins a writing contest to cover the landing of the Hindenburg, witnessing the unforeseen tragedy in person. Original newsreel footage of the event was integrated into the episode's scenes. On the popular CBS situation comedy WKRP in Cincinnati episode \\"Turkeys Away\\" the depiction of falling turkeys by Les Nessman is intended to emulate Herbert Morrison's broadcast. In season 4 of the sitcom 'Til Death, Brad Garrett's character Eddy is writing a book on the Hindenburg disaster. In the season 11 episode of Family Guy titled \\"Yug Ylimaf\\", Brian goes back in time to the Hindenburg disaster to have sex with a girl he met. They use the footage of the disaster in that scene and add Brian and the girl to the footage. In the season 4 episode titled \\"The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire\\", Peter Griffin owns a zeppelin with his face on it that he calls the \\"Hindenpeter\\". On The Richard Bey Show they used the audio from the disaster as a sound effect, specifically the \\"Oh the humanity!\\" line. Victor Rjesnjansky on A&E;'s Storage Wars: Texas often refers to his competitors, Ricky and Bubba, as \\"the Hindenburgs\\", a reference to their portly physique. In the Archer episode \\"Skytanic\\", which takes place on board an airship, Archer makes several references to the Hindenburg due to his paranoia about the airship catching fire, despite the airship's captain repeatedly telling him that the ship uses non-flammable helium. In an episode of The Amazing World of Gumball, while Gumball and Darwin escape from Molly's universe, they all jump upon an airship resembling the Hindenburg that then catches fire and crashes into a structural pylon, much like the disaster. In the Rocko's Modern Life episode \\"Feisty Geist,\\" while visiting a fortune teller, Heffer Wolfe is told of his past lives, and one of them is of when he was a hungry passenger aboard the airship Hillenburger (also a play on the name of the show's creative director Stephen Hillenburg). The German Heffer runs for the buffet, causing the zeppelin to lower and crash-land in a fireball, sending him flying. The CatDog episode \\"CatDogPig\\" featured a blimp advertising job interviews as a running gag throughout the episode. At the end, the blimp crashes into a pile of characters that CatDog had just dumped off, exploding and sending them all flying. In the Simpsons episode \\"Lisa the Beauty Queen\\", when Barney takes control of the Duff Blimp, he crashes it into an antenna, causing it to catch fire. Kent Brockman subsequently says the famous line \\"Oh the humanity!\\". In the Pok√©mon anime during the start of the Orange Islands saga (specifically the episodes \\"A Scare in the Air,\\" \\"Pok√© Ball Peril\\" and \\"The Lost Lapras\\"),our heroes travel on a blimp (fashioned with a metal framework on the inside just like a zeppelin), and whenever Ash orders Pikachu to use one of his electric attacks, Ash is warned not to do so, as Pikachu's electricity could ignite the inflammable gas and make the blimp explode (referencing how static electricity most likely had a large part to play in the Hindenburg disaster). The blimp eventually does explode when crash-landing on an island in \\"The Lost Lapras,\\" but our heroes are not hurt. In the Blue Mountain State episode \\"The Corn Field Pt. 1\\", the incident is referenced by Harmon when discussing a large joint of weed. The line \\"Oh the humanity!\\" is used jokingly by Donnie who is promptly ostracized by Larry for making light of the tragedy. The pilot episode of the NBC TV series Timeless (3 October 2016) revolves around a criminal who steals a time machine in an effort to alter the events of the past, starting with the Hindenburg disaster. In the episode, a journalist standing directly under the Hindenburg gets killed when it crashes down (in the original timeline). Historically, however, it was a man on the ground docking crew who died. Multiple episodes of J. J. Abrams's FOX series, Fringe, take place in a parallel universe, an identifying characteristic of which is the modern-day popularity of airships due to the non-occurrence of the Hindenburg disaster in that universe. =Television investigations= The Discovery Channel series MythBusters explored the incendiary paint hypothesis and the hydrogen hypothesis in an episode that aired January 10, 2007.MythBusters Season 5, Episode 70. While their experiments did not concern what actually started the fire, the show's hosts, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, demonstrated that when set alight with a blowtorch a 1:50 scale model of the Hindenburg burnt twice as fast in the presence of diffused hydrogen as without it. Combustion was observed in the burning skin, which would have accelerated the fire, but their experiments showed that hydrogen was the main fuel. The hydrogen-filled model produced a fire with flames that came out of the nose and resembled the newsreel footage of the Hindenburg disaster. That program concluded that the incendiary paint theory (IPT) myth was \\"Busted\\". The MythBusters constructed three 1/50 scale models made out of welded steel wire and covered in cotton fabric. They were suspended from a hangar ceiling and stayed horizontal the entire time. The first model was painted with iron-oxide and then aluminum powder dopes, closely replicating the actual skin of the Hindenburg. Ignited with a blowtorch, it took about 2 minutes to burn, with thermite-like events (sparkling blazes) noted in a few places. The second model had the same skin, but a water trough inside diffused hydrogen gas at sub-explosive concentrations. This one burned about twice as fast, with more thermite burning. The third model, done more for spectacle than anything else, had the skin painted with a thermite-like iron-oxide and aluminum powder enriched dope. It was noted that it would probably be far too heavy to fly. With model 2's hydrogen enrichment, it took 30 seconds to completely consume the skin. The conclusion was that neither the hydrogen gas nor the flammable skin bore sole responsibility for the speed of the fire, but both contributed. The National Geographic Channel program Seconds From Disaster had veteran air crash investigator Greg Feith study all of the available evidence, including eyewitness accounts, interviews with the last two living survivors, newsreel footage, weather reports, and the Hindenburg blueprints. Feith burned a sample of doped cloth and it took one minute to consume the whole piece, ruling out the skin as the primary accelerant. Feith's investigation came to a conclusion that the hydrogen puncture hypothesis was most probable. He also proved that by adding white cloth to a hydrogen flame that it would change the fire's color from invisible to orange. In Search of..., a show mainly focused on paranormal investigations and conspiracy theories, made an episode based on this tragic accident, and immediately raised the question of whether it was really an accident or instead sabotage by then-Nazi Germany. Devious Maids season four episode eight, Adrian and Evelyn toast their divorce with a bottle of 1932 Riesling salvaged from the Hindenburg.

The battle took place only 46 years after the first Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778) in a confrontation showing similar features: a Basque force engaging from the mountains a northbound expedition led by the Franks, and the same geographical setting (the Roncevaux Pass or a spot nearby). The battle resulted in the defeat of the Carolingian military expedition and the capture of its commanders Aeblus and Aznar S√°nchez in 824. The clash was to have further reaching consequences than those of the 778 engagement: the immediate establishment of the independent Kingdom of Pamplona. Background After Louis the Pious' half-hearted expedition to Pamplona circa 814, Basque tribal chieftain Enneko Aritza, who held strong family ties with the Banu Qasi led by his half-brother Musa, prevailed in the fortress circa 816 (or earlier) after news of Charlemagne's death (814) spread and a Frankish vassal, Belasko of Pamplona-- Velasco, cited as Balashk al-Yalashki in Muslim sources--was defeated in the Battle of Pancorbo. In 816, the revolt in Pamplona extended north across the Pyrenees, and in 816 Louis the Pious deposed Seguin (Sihimin) Duke of Vasconia and count of Bordeaux, who had been created duke of Vasconia in 812, for failing to suppress or sympathising with the rebellion, triggering a widespread revolt. The Basque lords on both sides of the Pyrenees rebelled, but were soon subdued in Dax by Louis (817). Lupus Centullo was then appointed duke (818), but was immediately deposed after he rebelled. Meanwhile, in Aragon (Jaca) the pro-Frankish count Aznar Galindez was overthrown by Enneko's allied count Garcia Malo (Garcia, 'the young' in old Basque) in 820. All Vasconia remained at this point in a shaky state of rebellion and the Frankish tenure on the Hispanic Marches was shifting out of control.  The battle  Roman watchtower of Urkulu next to the Roncevaux Pass In 824 an expedition was mustered by the Carolingian king in the Vasconia remaining under Frankish overlordship (north of the Pyrenees). The military force was headed by the Duke of Vasconia Aznar Sanchez, who led Basque troops hailing from current Gascony, and count Aeblus (\\"Aeblus et Asinarius comites cum copiis Wasconum ad Pampilonam missi\\"), commanding a Frankish army. The military force headed south with a view to quashing the Basque rebellion centred in Pamplona. The expedition arrived in the Basque stronghold, but encountered no resistance, and with the expedition having accomplished their goals, made their way back north with goods looted from the town. According to Umayyad chroniclers, a joint force of Navarrese (Enneko Aritza), Aragonese and Banu Qasi warriors, hidden in the forests, awaited the Carolingian army on the sinuous narrow passes of the region of Cize. The Basques engaged the two columns in their terrain. The Carolingian forces were routed, and the two commanders of the expedition were captured. Aftermath The Cize mountain passes While the Frankish count Aeblus was sent prisoner to C√≥rdoba, Aznar S√°nchez was released thanks to his kinship with the captors (\\"Asinarius vero misericordia eorum, qui eum ceperant, quasi qui consanguineus eorum esset\\") a fact that evidenced the good relations entertained at that moment by the joint Banu Qasi - Arista tandem with the Cordovan Umayyad, maybe after the accession to the throne of Abd ar-Rahman II in 822. Enneko Aritza emerged victorious after the battle and became the undisputed ruler of Pamplona. The new independent Basque kingdom brought about the definite detachment of the territories south of the Pyren√©es from the Duchy of Vasconia suzerain to the Franks, as well as the loss of control over the Hispanic Marches for them and the start of an on-off alliance between the kings of Pamplona and the muwallad Banu Qasi.

Life  Born in circa 1824 to Tu ªi Ha ªapai TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau and one of his secondary wives, Kalolaine Fusimatalili, of the Fusitua line. His father TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau later became King George Tupou I of a united Tonga. On 7 August 1831, Tupou was baptised into the Christian faith along with  ªUnga and his sibling. He was given the name Tƒìvita or David after the biblical King David. Following Tupou's marriage to SƒÅlote Lupepau ªu in the Christian rite, he cast aside his secondary consorts and declared all his children by them illegitimate including  ªUnga. After his father moved to Tongatapu, he appointed  ªUnga as acting governor of Vava ªu. In July 1865, English explorer Julius Brenchley visited Vava ªu for five days and met governor  ªUnga, who he described: > The governor is a very tall, imposing-looking man, in spite of the loss of > an eye, the result either of an accident or a wound in war. He was also > minus two fingers, cut off as a tribute, according to the custom of these > islands, to some deceased relatives. David has the reputation of being a > great warrior, and a friend of civilization; he speaks a little English, > provided there be no missionary within earshot. I found him dressed in a > piece of tapa, which he told me he changed every three days, and which > covered all his body with the exception of his legs and feet. He has a bed > and some old furniture of European make; his flag, the same as his father's, > is red, with a cross of the same colour on a white ground in the upper > corner. After the death of Queen SƒÅlote Lupepau ªu's son Prince Vuna TakitakimƒÅlohi in 1862, Tupou I was left without an heir to the throne. As a result,  ªUnga was legitimised and named Crown Prince under the terms of the first written constitution of Tonga on 4 November 1875.  ªUnga was appointed the first Prime Minister of Tonga on 1 January 1876, a post he held until his death. In November 1879, Reverend Shirley Waldemar Baker accompanied  ªUnga to Auckland for medical treatment. The Prince had been suffering from a serious liver ailment. The treatment was unable to save the Prince and he died in Auckland on 18 December 1879. Through the influence of Reverend Baker, the Crown Prince's remains were brought back on the German warship Nautilus on 20 May 1880. The funeral on 10 June at  ªUiha, Ha ªapai was attended by the German marines aboard and gun salutes from the Nautilus added much pomp and grandeur to the event. As a sign of his gratitude, King Tupou I appointed Reverend Baker the next Prime Minister of Tonga.

Soon she noticed every bus that went by was empty of passengers. Although there was sometimes violent retaliation, the boycott continued and eventually the Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was unconstitutional and the boycott ended. She married Arthur Glass in 1942, and both taught geography at Alabama State University, where her husband was also a professor. Glass died in 2012 at the age of 96.

He was convicted of two counts of fraud, one was during the 1980s and again in 1990. His 1980 conviction resulted in prison time and his disbarment by the Law Society of Upper Canada for two counts of defrauding clients. Carson is now a contributor to numerous national publications, and a regular contributor to right-wing news aggregate, News Hub Nation, headed by former Conservative Cabinet Minister, Monte Solberg. On July 27, 2012, Carson was charged with influence peddling by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Carson was eventually convicted of influence peddling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on October 6, 2016. In May 2014, Carson was further charged with three counts of prohibited lobbying and a single count of influence peddling. He was due in court to face these charges on June 18, 2014 in Ottawa. In November, 2016, an Ontario court found him guilty of the lobbying charges and imposed a $50,000 fine.\\" Bruce Carson, former Harper aide, fined $50,000 for illegal lobbying\\". The Globe and Mail, from The Canadian Press, Nov. 04, 2016 1978-1993 Since his early 30s, Carson had numerous legal difficulties related to financial improprieties, most of which involved fraud or non-payment of obligations. In 1978, Carson was ordered by a court judgement to pay a company over $1,900, stemming from a bounced cheque. In May 1979, Carson and his then-wife defaulted on their mortgage payments. This resulted in a Supreme Court of Ontario writ allowing possession of their property to be claimed by a savings and loan company. During that time, he was also sued by for $1,189.50 by the Hudson's Bay Company for unpaid merchandise. Early in the 1980s, he was disbarred by the Law Society of Upper Canada and sentenced to a jail term for defrauding clients on two occasions. In 1981, the disbarment finding summary stated that his \\"fiscal position had deteriorated due to a land development project in which he had become involved and due to an extravagant lifestyle.\\" In 1980, Carson faced a court order to pay $3,000 plus interest for non-payment of funds on the lease of a Lincoln Continental. From 1984 to 1990, during John Turner's incumbency, the Liberal caucus research bureau pays Carson for freelance work. In 1990, while employment doing research for the Library of Parliament, Carson was charged with fraud involving Budget Car and Truck Rental and a 1989 Toyota. Also during that year, he was charged with both the Bank of Montreal and the Toronto-Dominion Bank, each for amounts greater than $1,000. In June of that year, he pleaded guilty to all three counts, and received a suspended sentence with 24 months probation, provided that he \\"continue treatment at the R.O.H. (Royal Ottawa Hospital),\\" and pay $4,000 in restitution to Budget Car and Truck Rental within 23 months. Later in the 1990s, Carson worked for the Progressive Conservative research service at the Ontario legislature, and for Conservative senators on Parliament Hill. Carson was declared a bankrupt in 1993 with a debt of over $103,000. In 2002, he had $369,000 in \\"liabilities\\" and agreed to what is termed a \\"proposal\\", a mitigating measure, an option to avoid bankruptcy which allows one to arrange to pay one's debts. Position as senior advisor to the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper On February 6, 2006, he began employment with the Prime Minister's Office as an aide and senior advisor. Harper has stated that he did not know of Carson's convictions in the 1980s, or the fact that he had received court-ordered psychiatric treatment, Carson left the Prime Minister's office in 2008. Employment at the Canada School of Energy and Environment After leaving the Prime Minister's office in 2008, he began employment as executive director of the Canada School of Energy and Environment on August 14, 2008. The institution was set up by the University of Calgary, the University of Alberta and the University of Lethbridge. It is funded by a grant from the Canadian federal government. The organization coordinates clean energy research. He returned to the Prime Minister's office for a short time in January 2009, then later that year, returned to the Canada School of Energy and Environment. During his employment there, Carson accrued personal expenses, which the organization had to pay after his departure. Lobbying allegations Carson was allegedly lobbying on behalf of H2O Pros, an Ottawa-based water company that had a financial connection to his fianc√©e. Carson is alleged to have been helping secure a contract involving the sale of water filtration systems to the Indian Affairs Department to First Nations in need of clean drinking water. Carson was never registered as a lobbyist, and as a former political staff member, was prohibited from lobbying government agencies for five years after leaving office. On March 25, 2011, head of H20 Global Group, Patrick Hill, denied that Carson had lobbied on his behalf. On February 6, 2009, during leave from his position as head of the Canada School of Energy and Environment, the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources Cassie Doyle received an email from Carson's account, lobbying for a $25 million grant on behalf of the organization. Carson stated later that the email was drafted before he returned to the Prime Ministers office, and that it had been sent accidentally. Carson was present at the signing of the contract, witnessing and initialing it. The contract guaranteed 20 percent of the gross profits go to Michele McPherson. McPherson is 22 years old, his fianc√©e, and an alleged former escort. She is alleged to have acted as an intermediary. =Letters expressing concern= In April 2011, Conservative Party officials released two letters that were sent by Stephen Harper's former chief of staff Guy Giorno two years earlier in January 2009 to the federal conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. The letters indicate that Carson, while working at the Prime Minister's office in 2009, may have been engaged in lobbying to secure a $25 million grant for the School of Energy and Environment. Carbon Management Canada eventually received the grant, an organization with which Carson is also affiliated. The letters also reveal that some of the senior staff members were concerned enough to alert the federal conflict of interest and ethics commissioners. Then Deputy Minister of the Environment Ian Shugart sent a third letter to the federal conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. However, Prime Minister Harper stated that before the 2010 claims that influenced peddling allegations, his senior staff had no prior knowledge of any controversial activity by Carson. Harper stated: \\"The fact is, I did not know about these revelations that we're finding out today. I don't know why I did not know.\\" 2012 influence peddling charges On July 27, 2012, Carson was charged with influence peddling by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's \\"A\\" Division Commercial Crime Section. The charge is formally known under the Criminal Code (Section 121(1)(d)) as \\"Fraud on the Government\\". The RCMP started the investigation in March 2011, after Prime Minister's office provided a referral. prompted by the publication of an APTN National News story that investigating and revealing that in 2010 The single count of influence peddling is a result of Carson's alleged acceptance of commission for a third party connected to a business transaction related to the Canadian Government. The Prime Minister's office also asked that the Ethics Commission and Lobbying Commission both investigate Carson. Neither commission has yet to release the result of their probes. Carson was scheduled to appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Ottawa on September 10, 2012. His lawyer, Pat McCann, stated that Carson is not in custody, but has been summoned to surrender himself when he appears in court. On October 1, 2012, Carson appeared briefly in court in Ottawa to schedule dates for two future appearances. The first will be a closed-door, judicial pre-trial between party lawyers and a judge on October 17. The second will be an appearance in remand court on October 22. Patrick McCann, Carson's lawyer, declined comment while leaving the court. In May 2014, the RCMP laid a further four charges against Carson resulting from his lobbying for the Canada School of Energy and Environment and the Energy Policy Institute of Canada. The new charges are three counts of prohibited lobbying and a single count of influence peddling. Carson was initially acquitted on the charge of fraud on the Government on November 17, 2015.R v Carson, 2015 ONSC 7127. However, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the acquittal and entered in a verdict of guilty in a 2-1 decision on October 6, 2016.R v Carson, 2017 ONCA 142. The guilty verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in an 8-1 decision.R v Carson, 2018 SCC 12. Carson was convicted of three counts for violations of the Lobbying Act on September 16, 2016.R v Carson, 2016 ONCJ 596. On appeal, the conviction on one the counts was overturned while the other two were affirmed. Carson was fined $45,000 for the violations.R v Carson, 2017 ONSC 5371.

The raid, the fifth South African attack on a neighbouring country since 1981, killed 12 people including women and children; only five of the victims were members of the African National Congress. Background In the 1980s, relations between Botswana and South Africa were strained. Anti-apartheid groups like the African National Congress (ANC) used Botswana and other countries in Southern Africa as refuge. The ANC set up bases in Gaborone that issued crash courses for guerilla attacks; under the guise of weekend tourists, new recruits would receive training on grenade handling and a list of targets to attack. Despite Botswana's non-alignment policy, the South African Defence Force conducted several cross-border raids to stop the groups. In 1981, the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) purchased Soviet weaponry. President Quett Masire justified the deal as a way to allow BDF to better prevent groups like the ANC from crossing into South Africa. Shots were fired across the Botswana-South African border in April 1982. Grenade attacks earlier in the week outside Cape Town that killed two South Africa members of Parliament and news of an expected attack on Pretoria in July 1985 pushed General Constand Viljoen to launch the attack. The following locations were identified as MK safe houses in Gaborone by the SADF: *Plot C, Tlokweng: Safe house used for ANC training of the Transvaal and Western Cape suicide squads *Plot A, Tlokweng: Occupied by \\"George\\" who accommodated terrorists *7819 Broadhurst: Occupied by Duke Machobane, provided accommodation for Umkhonto we Sizwe *13212 Broadhurst: Occupied by Nkukwane Motsweni, alias Mkhulu, responsible for the transportation of trained terrorists from Zambia to safe houses in Botswana *2914 Pudulugo Close: Occupied by Mike Hamlyn, responsible for accommodating terrorists and for transporting ANC recruits attached to the \\"Transvaal Suicide Squad\\" *Cycle Mart Building: housing the offices of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the ANC in Botswana and who also distributed a propaganda pamphlet in \\"newsletter\\" form aimed against South Africa *15717 Broadhurst: Occupied by George Pwale, controller of ANC financial affairs and responsible for the bomb blast at the Carlton, Johannesburg, in December 1976. The attack Around 1:30 am on 14 June, South African soldiers crossed the border into Botswana. To lead the attack, the SADF employed former operatives of the Selous Scouts, a special regiment of the Rhodesian Security Forces. General Viljoen stated that the soldiers used megaphones to urge the residents of Gaborone to hide in their houses while the raid occurred. According to Manuel Olifant, a policeman involved in the raid, the SADF readied around 50 tanks, helicopters, and jet fighters in Zeerust for use if Botswana retaliated, but they were not needed. =Casualties= Twelve people were killed in the attack. A partial list follows: *George Phahle *Lindi Phahle *Joseph Malaza *Basi Zondi *Duke Machobane *a six-year-old Mosotho boy *Ahmed Mohammed Geer, a Somali-born Dutch citizen *two Botswana women *Mike Hamlyn, a South African student who was studying in Botswana *Thamsanga Mnyele, a South African graphic artist and guerilla *Dick Mtsweni, a 71-year-old man employed by the ANC as a driver. Aftermath Witnesses say that civilians were killed despite what SADF reports said at the time. Muff Andersson, a former member of MK, said that instead of attacking legitimate targets, the SADF instead arbitrarily picked ANC sympathisers to \\"teach the ANC a lesson\\". She asserts that the SADF \\"did not care who was killed.\\" =Reactions= *: At first, the attack was shown in a positive light by the South African press. A memorial, Freedom Park, was built in Pretoria to honour those who died in this attack and others during the apartheid years. *: In 1985, the representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations said that South Africa \\"in no way justified the violation of sovereignty and the killing or wounding of innocent people.\\" In 1986, the United Kingdom announced that it would provide military aid to Botswana to stop South Africa's raids. *: The raid prompted the United States to recall its ambassador to South Africa. =United Nations Resolution= On 17 June 1985, the United Nations representative of Botswana sent a letter to the President of the United Nations Security Council asking for help to deal with the raid. The representative from South Africa sent a letter on the same day stating that Botswana had been warned about harbouring groups like the ANC, citing that \\"a State had a right to take appropriate steps to protect its own security and territorial integrity against such attacks.\\" The Botswana Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the evidence of terrorist activities starting in Botswana was fabricated. South Africa responded that since Botswana did not sign the Nkomati Accord, a non-aggression pact with South Africa, the ANC was able to use Botswana as a base for its attacks. Resolution 568 was drafted on 21 June 1985 that ordered South Africa to pay Botswana for damages, allowed Botswana to house refugees, and encouraged other countries to help Botswana and condemn South Africa.

Different food traditions have used it as a fresh cut or as a cured pork product (with smoke and/or curing salt). As a cured and smoked meat in America it is called jowl bacon or, especially in the Southern United States, hog jowl. In the US, hog jowl is a staple of soul food, and there is a longer culinary tradition outside the United States: the cured non-smoked Italian variant is called guanciale.  Culinary  Jowl bacon can be fried and eaten as a main course, similar to streaky bacon, such as in a traditional full English breakfast. Often, it is used as a seasoning for beans, black-eyed peas or cooked with leafy green vegetables such as collard greens or turnip greens in a traditional Southeastern meal. Jowl meat may also be chopped and used as a garnish, similar to bacon bits, or served in sandwich form. Pork jowl can be used as a binding ingredient in pork liver sausages such as liverwurst and braunschweiger.  Traditions in the US  A Southern US tradition of eating black-eyed peas and greens with either pork jowls or fatback on New Year's Day to ensure prosperity throughout the new year goes back hundreds of years. During the American Civil War (1861 to 1865), the peas were thought to represent wealth to the Southerners, while the Northern army considered the food to be fit as livestock feed only. Pigs (and by extension, pork products) were symbolic of \\"wealth and gluttony\\" and consuming jowls or fatback on New Year's Day guaranteed a good new year. Storage Because pork jowl can be cured, like many other cuts of pork, it has been a traditional wintertime food as it is able to be stored for long periods of time without refrigeration.

Drag racing career  Originally an engineering student at the University of Texas at Arlington, he opened a used car dealership and drag raced cars from the dealership to promote his business. After each win, he sold the car the next day, which gained him more attention. This led to him taking racing more seriously, driving a 1958 Chevy Impala with a 409 Cubic Inch Chevrolet \\"W-Block\\" engine made famous by the Beach Boys in their song, \\"409\\". He moved over to Chrysler Corporation cars by 1963, driving a Plymouth Sport Fury. As the 1960s progressed, Snow developed innovations such as stretching the wheelbase to improve handling, which lead to several class wins in 1966‚Äì'67. Stretching the chassis was his seminal contribution to the new Fuel Coupe, aka Funny Car class, which evolved out of the Altered wheelbase Factory Experimental (aka \\"FX\\") and super stock classes. Although funny car was not a class recognized by the National Hot Rod Association, Snow was allowed to run in the dragster classes, where he ran a 9.04-second quarter-mile E.T. He repeated he success in 1967, running an 8.67-second quarter-mile E.T. in the new Super Eliminator class. By 1968, he went to the gasoline-burning classes and won B/Altered (a class for modified production vehicles). At this time, Snow realized that the increased torque that was coming from engines like the new generation Chrysler Hemi engine would destroy a transmission, whereas direct drive would be more suited to the conditions under full load. He explained it this way: \\"We worked with Crower to come up with a four-disc Crowerglide centrifugal clutch. Though it was sluggish off the line, it would mow down the automatic cars, which always nosed-over at about 185 mph.\\" The idea being that as engine RPM increased, the clutches would engage and there would be no gearsets to destroy. With the simplified drivetrain, he was the first funny car driver over the 200 mph barrier in the autumn of 1969, at Dickson, Texas, later running 205.046 mph at Orange County International Raceway. Snow said, astonished: \\"The sea level location gave us extra horsepower, and we went 200.88 mph on the first pass. I didn't think it such a big deal at the time, but we kept running more than 200 mph at just about every race after that.\\" By the late 1970s, Snow took a sabbatical due to costs as a result of the 1970s oil crisis and the political situation in the Middle East that precipitated it, along with sub-par seasons, returning in 1981 to race in the Top Fuel class. During this time, he worked on developing his direct drive for Top Fuel cars. Notable achievements in the 1980s include the first 4-second E.T. run in an NHRA sanctioned event at Royal Purple Raceway. However, these have been overshadowed by allegations that he molested a male fan he met at a dragstrip in 1987.http://sexoffenderissues.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/another-victim-comes- forward-against.html After an accident in 1992, he retired from drag racing.  Sex offenses  Snow was arrested for sex offenses as early as 1978, though he was acquitted of all but one misdemeanor citation, for which he was fined. This did not stop him from drag racing in Britain, which was covered by Anglia Television's regional News program, About Anglia.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKRGD0DT8TE Anglia Television News Report of Gene Snow at Santa Pod More serious allegations came in 2007 when he was accused of molesting a teenage fan in the mid-1980s, who claimed Snow brought him to his home and seduced him. These allegations arose when the press reported his conviction for an unrelated sex offense against a child, which was plea bargained down to a lesser offence of injuring a child. This excused him from registering as a sex offender. In response to the plea bargain, the Twin Falls, Idaho, District Attorney responded: \\"That's horrifying. They should at least talk to [the alleged victim] or myself after the initial information was relayed to their office by me. They should at least let [the alleged victim] know how the case is progressing since he is a witness who could greatly help their case.\\" Snow allegedly even went as far as drilling holes in the alleged victim's home to spy on the boy, according to the alleged victim's testimony. The sexual abuse allegedly occurred for several years, during which time Snow allegedly paid the victim for his services. Snow pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years' probation.

Ryan Holiday, Author Of 'Trust Me, I'm Lying', Wants To Break The Media. The Huffington Post. June 29, 2012. As an example of his argument that blogs shape the news, Holiday outlines how the political blog Politico dedicated significant coverage to the campaign of Tim Pawlenty two years before the 2012 elections in order to generate pageviews for advertisers. Although Pawlenty did not yet have an official campaign, this kickstarted the media cycle which painted Pawlenty as a serious presidential candidate. As an example of the pageview-intensive blogosphere, Holiday uses the example of Jezebel writer Irin Carmon's attack on Jon Stewart and The Daily Show with misleading claims of \\"The Daily Show's Woman Problem.\\"Frauenfelder, Mark.

She studied Russian and theater at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and marine biology at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. After working in performing arts administration, she attended medical school. She took up writing as a hobby during her years as a physician in private practice.

Her works were discovered by an editor at Sourcebooks who purchased the rights to her first six books. Her earliest writings were variations on Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, focusing on different plot developments that might change the course of the original story, but always with the same resolution of Elizabeth Bennet marrying Mr. Darcy, a series which she later titled The Pemberley Variations. Her modern adaptation, The Man Who Loved Pride & Prejudice, features a female marine biologist who teaches at the Marine Biological Laboratory and at Haverford College. Her 11 books have sold over 180,000 copies.  The Pemberley Variations  The Pemberley Variations is a series of novels exploring the roads not taken in Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy journey through new challenges to reach a satisfying conclusion.

Oxy. 235 or P. Oxy. II 235) is a horoscope written in Greek. It was discovered in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a sheet. It is dated to the 1st century. Currently it is housed in the Cambridge University Library.P. Oxy. 235 at the Oxyrhynchus Online  Description  The papyrus contains the horoscope of a person born about 10 p.m. on September 28, between 15 and 37 AD. The measurements of the fragment are 210 by 135 mm. The handwriting is a good-sized semi-uncial hand. This is one of five known horoscopes written on papyrus. It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1899. Contents The horoscope gives the sign of the zodiac occupied by the sun, moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and the four chief points in the heavens. A feature which distinguishes this horoscope from the other four known is a diagram below the text illustrating the position of the heavens at the time of the birth of the subject. The diagram consists of a circle divided by two diameters intersecting at right angles and connecting the zenith with the nadir, and the point in the heavens which was rising with that which was setting. The signs of the zodiac are marked inside the circle, the sun, moon, planets, and points of the heavens outside it, in a line with the sign to which they belong. Beginning at the top appear Aquarius at the zenith, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, containing the moon and the point which was rising, Gemini, Cancer, Leo at the nadir, Virgo, Libra, containing the sun and Mars, Scorpio, containing Mercury, Venus, and the point which was setting, Sagittarius, containing Saturn and Jupiter, and Capricorn. There is some error in the astronomical calculations recorded, because the position of the planets indicated could not have occurred during the span of time in which the horoscope was made.

The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on July 21, 2012. The series follows the adventures and endeavors of SpongeBob and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and Patrick try to join an extreme sports team called The Drasticals by completing dangerous and extreme tasks.

Plot summary SpongeBob and Patrick play in the sand on Sand Mountain when they see an extreme sports team named The Drasticals, consisting of Johnny Krill, Not Dead Ted, and Grand Maul Granny. A British fish tells SpongeBob and Patrick about The Drasticals, with Patrick mishearing \\"extreme sports\\" as \\"extreme spots\\" due to the fish's lisp, then getting stung by jellyfish to get \\"extreme spots.\\" Johnny laughs and tells SpongeBob to try motorbiking to see if he is good at extreme sports, while Patrick sandboards down the mountain with Granny. The sports are too \\"extreme\\" for SpongeBob and Patrick, and they jump rope instead. Patrick quickly gets tired, and The Drasticals demonstrate \\"extreme\\" jumping rope, with Ted lighting on fire and jumping into a plane. SpongeBob and Patrick then blow bubbles, which the Drasticals make extreme by having Johnny ride his motorcycle inside a bubble and knock over a building. SpongeBob boxes a pillow and loses, which Johnny puts in a washing machine and is attacked by a living mattress. Patrick demonstrates dumpster diving, which Granny takes further by having the trash compacted with her still in it. SpongeBob and Patrick show that they like to catch jellyfish, which gets The Drasticals injured and covered in welts. Johnny admits that the spots are \\"way extreme,\\" and the British fish says that extreme spots come from extreme sports. The episode ends with Patrick asking, \\"Who is that guy?\\" Production Actor Johnny Knoxville, shown here in 2011, guest starred in the episode as the voice of Johnny Krill. \\"Extreme Spots\\" was written by Luke Brookshier, Marc Ceccarelli, and Derek Iversen, and the animation was directed by Tom Yasumi.

The writing staff wrote the episode specifically for Knoxville. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said \\"[Nickelodeon] wanted to do a show about extreme sports and the first thing that came to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans living that are as extreme as him.\\" Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said \\"I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob. Everyone is psyched[...] As soon as I was done recording this episode, I started begging them to let me come back and record another one.\\" Knoxville asked if he needed to come up with a funny voice for his character. However, the producers said \\"No, we want [your voice].\\" Knoxville claimed that \\"it's not easy\\" providing a vocal cameo. He added \\"It's a different kind of work.\\" Aside from providing vocal cameo, Knoxville also did a photo shoot with a SpongeBob plush toy for the episode. Knoxville said \\"They loaded me up with a bunch of schwag! Every toy they ever made‚Äîskateboards, wristbands, all kinds of great stuff.

This syndrome can also be referred to as \\"psycho-organic syndrome\\", \\"organic solvent syndrome\\", \\"chronic painter's syndrome\\", \\"occupational solvent encephalopathy\\", \\"solvent intoxication\\", \\"toxic solvent syndrome\\", \\"painters disease\\", \\"psycho-organic syndrome\\", \\"chronic toxic encephalopathy\\", and \\"neurasthenic syndrome\\". The multiple names of solvent-induced syndromes combined with inconsistency in research methods makes referencing this disease difficult and its catalog of symptoms vague. Symptoms Two characteristic symptoms of CSE are deterioration of memory (particularly short-term memory), and attention impairments. There are, however, numerous other symptoms that accompany to varying degrees. Variability in the research methods studying CSE makes characterizing these symptoms difficult, and some may be questionable regarding whether they are actual symptoms of solvent-induced syndromes, simply because of how infrequently they appear. Characterizing of CSE symptoms is more difficult because CSE is currently poorly defined, and the mechanism behind it is not understood yet. =Neurological= Reported neurological symptoms include difficulty sleeping, decrease in intellectual capacity, dizziness, altered visual perceptive abilities, affected psychomotor skills, forgetfulness, and disorientation. The mechanism behind these symptoms beyond solvent molecules crossing the blood-brain barrier is currently unknown. Neurological signs include impaired vibratory sensation at extremities and an inability to maintain steady motion, a possible effect from psychomotor damage in the brain. Other symptoms that have been seen include fatigue, decreased strength, and unusual gait. One study found that there was a correlation between decreased red blood cell count and level of solvent exposure, but not enough data has been found to support any blood tests to screen for CSE. =Sensory alterations= A 1988 study indicated that some solvent-exposed workers suffered from loss of smell or damage to color vision; however this may or may not have been actually caused by exposure to organic solvents. There is other evidence for subtle impairment of color vision (especially impairment of Titian color or \\"blue-yellow\\" color discernment), synergistic exacerbation of hearing loss, and loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). =Psychological= Psychological symptoms of CSE that have been reported include mood swings, increased irritability, depression, a lack of initiative, uncontrollable and intense displays of emotion such as spontaneous laughing or crying, and a severe lack of interest in sex. Some psychological symptoms are believed to be linked to frustration with other symptoms, neurological, or pathophysiological symptoms of CSE. A case study of a painter diagnosed with CSE reported that the patient frequently felt defensive, irritable, and depressed because of his memory deficiencies. Causes Organic solvents that cause CSE are characterized as volatile, blood soluble, lipophilic compounds that are typically liquids at normal temperature. These can be compounds or mixtures used to extract, dissolve, or suspend non-water-soluble materials such as fats, oils, lipids, cellulose derivatives, waxes, plastics, and polymers. These solvents are often used industrially in the production of paints, glues, coatings, degreasing agents, dyes, polymers, pharmaceuticals, and printing inks. Exposure to solvents can occur by inhalation, ingestion, or direct absorption through the skin. Of the three, inhalation is the most common form of exposure, with the solvent able to rapidly pass through lung membranes and then into fatty tissue or cell membranes. Once in the bloodstream, organic solvents easily cross the blood-brain barrier, due to their lipophilic properties. However, the sequence of effects that these solvents have on the brain is not yet fully understood. Some common organic solvents known to cause CSE include formaldehyde, acetates, and alcohols. Diagnosis Due to its non-specific nature, diagnosing CSE requires a multidisciplinary \\"Solvent Team\\" typically consisting of a neurologist, occupational physician, occupational hygienist, neuropsychologist, and sometimes a psychiatrist or toxicologist. Together, the team of specialists assess the patient's history of exposure, symptoms, and course of symptom development relative to the amount and duration of exposure, presence of neurological signs, and any existing neuropsychological impairment. Furthermore, CSE must be diagnosed \\"by exclusion\\". This means that all other possible causes of the patient's symptoms must first be ruled out beforehand. Because screening and assessing for CSE is a complex and time-consuming procedure requiring several specialists of multiple fields, few cases of CSE are formally diagnosed in the medical field. This may, in part, be a reason for the syndrome's lack of widespread recognition. The solvents responsible for neurological effects dissipate quickly after an exposure, leaving only indirect evidence of their presence, in the form of temporary or permanent impairments. Brain imaging techniques which have been explored in research have shown little promise as alternative methods to diagnose CSE. Neuroradiology and functional imaging have shown mild cortical atrophy, and effects in dopamine-mediated frontostriatal circuits in some cases. Examinations of regional cerebral blood flow in some imaging techniques have also shown some cerebrovascular abnormalities in patients with CSE, but the data were not different enough from healthy patients to be considered significant. The most promising brain imaging technique being studied currently is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) but as of now, no specific brain imaging techniques are available to reliably diagnose CSE. =Classification= Introduced by a working group from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1985, WHO diagnostic criteria states that CSE can occur in three stages, organic affective syndrome (type I), mild chronic toxic encephalopathy (type II), and severe chronic toxic encephalopathy (type III). Shortly after, a workshop in Raleigh-Durham, NC (United States) released a second diagnostic criterion which recognizes four stages as symptoms only (type 1), sustained personality or mood swings (type 2A), impairment of intellectual function (type 2B), and dementia (type 3). Though not identical, the WHO and Raleigh criteria are relatively comparable. WHO type I and Raleigh types 1 and 2A are believed to encompass the same stages of CSE, and WHO type II and Raleigh type 2B both involve deficiencies in memory and attention. No other international classifications for CSE have been proposed, and neither the WHO nor Raleigh criteria have been uniformly accepted for epidemiological studies. Treatment Like diagnosis, treating CSE is difficult because it is vaguely defined and data on the mechanism of CSE effects on neural tissue are lacking. There is no existing treatment that is effective at completely recovering any neurological or physical function lost due to CSE. This is believed to be because of the limited regeneration capabilities in the central nervous system. Furthermore, existing symptoms of CSE can potentially worsen with age. Some symptoms of CSE, such as depression and sleep issues, can be treated separately, and therapy is available to help patients adjust to any untreatable disabilities. Current treatment for CSE involves treating accompanying psychopathology, symptoms, and preventing further deterioration. History Cases of CSE have been studied predominantly in northern Europe, though documented cases have been found in other countries such as the United States, France, and China. The first documented evidence for CSE was in the early 1960s from a paper published by Helena Hanninen, a Finnish neuropsychologist. Her paper described a case of workers suffering from carbon disulfide intoxication at a rubber manufacturing company and coined the term \\"psycho-organic syndrome\\". Studies of solvent effects on intellectual functioning, memory, and concentration were carried out in the Nordic countries, with Denmark spearheading the research. Growing awareness of the syndrome in the Nordic countries occurred in the 1970s. To reduce cases of CSE in the workforce, a diagnostic criterion for CSE appeared on information notices in occupational disease records in the European Commission. Following, from 1998 to 2004, was a health surveillance program for CSE cases among construction painters in the Netherlands. By 2000, a ban was put into action against using solvent-based paints indoors, which resulted in a considerable reduction of solvent exposure to painters. As a result, the number of CSE cases dropped substantially after 2002. In 2005‚Äì2007, no new CSE cases were diagnosed among construction painters in the Netherlands, and no occupational CSE has been encountered in workers under thirty years of age in Finland since 1995. Though movements to reduce CSE have been successful, CSE still poses an issue to many workers that are at occupational risk. Statistics published in 2012 by Nicole Cherry et al. claim that at least 20% of employees in Finland still encounter organic solvents at the workplace, and 10% of them experience some form of disadvantage from the exposure. In Norway, 11% of the male population of workers and 7% of female workers are still exposed to solvents daily and as of 2006, the country has the highest rate of diagnosed CSE in Europe. Furthermore, due to the complexity of screening for CSE, there is still a high likelihood of a population of undiagnosed cases. Occupations that have been found to have higher risk of causing CSE are painter, printer, industrial cleaner, and paint or glue manufacturer. Of them, painters have been found to have the highest recorded incidence of CSE. Spray painters in particular have higher exposure intensities than other painters. Studies of instances of CSE have specifically been carried out in naval dockyards, mineral fiber manufacturing companies, and rayon viscose plants.

Kelly's Camp consists of twelve log buildings along the western shore of the lake. The structures were notable for being one of the most extensive summer cabin enclaves remaining in the park. Early reports following the advance of the Howe Ridge Fire on August 12, 2018 are that nine or ten structures have been destroyed. History The present area of the camp was originally the homestead of Frank Kelly, who staked his claim in March 1894. Kelly married Emmeline \\"Liney\\" Haworth in 1897 and the family spent some of their summers at the camp. In 1906 Frank Kelly launched the Emmeline, a motorized launch, which he hired out for visitors to the lake. Kelly partnered with Orville Denny around 1912 and operated the Cassie D., then went into business with John Lewis, operator of the Glacier Hotel on the other side of the lake. They operated the Ethel and the Lewtana. Kelly operated the boating business until 1921, when he sold out, but bought the Emmeline back and operated it until 1936. Kelly had difficulty maintaining his land claim after the park was established in 1910, and needed a special patent granted by Congress in 1914 to own his property. During the 1920s Kelly started building cabins for rent on his property. In 1922 he sold two parcels which financed later development. Fannie Hollingsworth bought both parcels totaling and built the \\"Hollybourne\\" cabin starting in the fall of 1926, together with her daughter Cecilia Hollingsworth Chadbourne and Cecilia's husband Horace. In 1930 Kelly sold another to Horace Chadbourne. Chadbourne developed the land as a tent camp, which was also called Hollybourne. In 1934 both Hollybourne sites were sold by Cecilia to the government in return for a life estate. By 1930 Kelly had built nine or ten cabins for rental and Frank and Liney Kelly lived in the Big House all year. Other cabins included Hollybourne, the Sun Cabin, the Bay Cabin and the Halfway Cabin. Horace Chadbourne and Frank Kelley cleared a road grade from the Lake McDonald Ranger Station to the camp in 1933, which was completed by the Park Service. Both Emmeline and Frank Kelly died within a day of each other of pneumonia in January 1935. Vern Kelly, their son, took over the camp, although bookings declined during the remainder of the 1930s and during World War II. The camp revived after the war and was a popular family resort. Vern Kelly died in 1958, and his widow Helen sold a parcel to Wendell Hammond, who built two cabins. In 1963 Helen sold another parcel to Edward and Mary Jane Theefs, who built a cabin. Starting in 1964 the existing cabins were sold to tenured camp patrons. In 1988 a Kelly descendant sold the Big House and one cabin to the Park Service in exchange for a life estate. Property changed hands through the 2000s. The National Park Service acquired the site in 2014. The site was almost completely destroyed during the Howe Ridge Fire in August 2018, which burned seven of the privately-owned residences, and the Park Service-owned cabin and main camp house, leaving just one cabin standing. Description The cabins are mostly small log structures with gables facing the lake. The Big House was built in 1910. The largest structure in the camp, it was set back in the trees near the northern end of the camp. It was built in two phases, both of 1-1/2 stories. The older section had a large room used as an office, with a living area and kitchen in the newer section. Sleeping rooms were upstairs. Cabin 00 was built between 1925 and 1930. It is the only cabin with gables on the sides, and is the northernmost, with a long porch facing the lake. There is a large room downstairs, with an adjoining bedroom covered by a sleeping loft. Kitchen and bathroom facilities are in an extension to the rear. Near the Big House and Cabin 00, there is an open-walled shop, built between 1910 and 1920, a 1927 generator house with an operating hydroelectric generator system, a 1910 woodshed, a 1905-1910 shower and laundry house and a root cellar from the same period. Cabins 1 through 8 are arranged along the beach. All are of log construction and have gables facing the lake, with minor variations in size and arrangement. Bathroom additions were added to the rear of each cabin after 1970. Most of the original shingled roofs have been replaced with metal to reduce fire danger. Cabins 1 through 4 remain as contributing structures. Cabins 5 and 6 have been altered and are no longer considered contributing structures. Cabins 7 and 8 retain their integrity. Other structures include an open chapel, built about 1945 and a series of privies associated with cabins 00, 2, 4, 5 and 6.

Traditionally, sleep has been studied as part of psychology and medicine. The study of sleep from a neuroscience perspective grew to prominence with advances in technology and proliferation of neuroscience research from the second half of the twentieth century. The importance of sleep is demonstrated by the fact that organisms daily spend hours of their time in sleep, and that sleep deprivation can have disastrous effects ultimately leading to death. For a phenomenon so important, the purposes and mechanisms of sleep are only partially understood, so much so that as recently as the late 1990s it was quipped: \\"The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness\\". However, the development of improved imaging techniques like EEG, PET and fMRI, along with high computational power have led to an increasingly greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep. The fundamental questions in the neuroscientific study of sleep are: # What are the correlates of sleep i.e. what are the minimal set of events that could confirm that the organism is sleeping? # How is sleep triggered and regulated by the brain and the nervous system? # What happens in the brain during sleep? # How can we understand sleep function based on physiological changes in the brain? # What causes various sleep disorders and how can they be treated? Other areas of modern neuroscience sleep research include the evolution of sleep, sleep during development and aging, animal sleep, mechanism of effects of drugs on sleep, dreams and nightmares, and stages of arousal between sleep and wakefulness. TOC Introduction  Rapid eye movement sleep (REM), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM or non-REM), and waking represent the three major modes of consciousness, neural activity, and physiological regulation.J. Alan Hobson, Edward F. Pace-Scott, & Robert Stickgold (2000), \\"Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states\\", Behavioral and Brain Sciences 23. NREM sleep itself is divided into multiple stages ‚Äì N1, N2 and N3. Sleep proceeds in 90-minute cycles of REM and NREM, the order normally being N1 ‚Üí N2 ‚Üí N3 ‚Üí N2 ‚Üí REM. As humans fall asleep, body activity slows down. Body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and energy use all decrease. Brain waves get slower and bigger. The excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine becomes less available in the brain.Brown, pp. 1100‚Äì1102. Humans often maneuver to create a thermally friendly environment‚Äîfor example, by curling up into a ball if cold. Reflexes remain fairly active. REM sleep is considered closer to wakefulness and is characterized by rapid eye movement and muscle atonia. NREM is considered to be deep sleep (the deepest part of NREM is called slow wave sleep), and is characterized by lack of prominent eye movement or muscle paralysis. Especially during non-REM sleep, the brain uses significantly less energy during sleep than it does in waking. In areas with reduced activity, the brain restores its supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule used for short-term storage and transport of energy.Brown, pp. 1118‚Äì1119: \\"Compared with wakefulness, sleep reduces brain energy demands, as suggested by the 44% reduction in the cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) of glucose (791) and a 25% reduction in the CMR of O2 (774) during sleep.\\" (Since in quiet waking the brain is responsible for 20% of the body's energy use, this reduction has an independently noticeable impact on overall energy consumption.) During slow- wave sleep, humans secrete bursts of growth hormone. All sleep, even during the day, is associated with secretion of prolactin.Eve Van Cauter & Karine Spiegel (1999). \\"Circadian and Sleep Control of Hormonal Secretions\\", in Turek & Zee (eds.), Regulation of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, pp. 397‚Äì425. According to the Hobson & McCarley activation-synthesis hypothesis, proposed in 1975‚Äì1977, the alternation between REM and non-REM can be explained in terms of cycling, reciprocally influential neurotransmitter systems. Sleep timing is controlled by the circadian clock, and in humans, to some extent by willed behavior. The term circadian comes from the Latin circa, meaning \\"around\\" (or \\"approximately\\"), and diem or dies, meaning \\"day\\". The circadian clock refers to a biological mechanism that governs multiple biological processes causing them to display an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of about 24 hours. These rhythms have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi and cyanobacteria.  Correlates of sleep  One of the important questions in sleep research is clearly defining the sleep state. This problem arises because sleep was traditionally defined as a state of consciousness and not as a physiological state, thus there was no clear definition of what minimum set of events constitute sleep and distinguish it from other states of partial or no consciousness. The problem of making such a definition is complicated because it needs to include a variety of modes of sleep found across different species. At a symptomatic level, sleep is characterized by lack of reactivity to sensory inputs, low motor output, diminished conscious awareness and rapid reversibility to wakefulness. However, to translate these into a biological definition is difficult because no single pathway in the brain is responsible for the generation and regulation of sleep. One of the earliest proposals was to define sleep as the deactivation of the cerebral cortex and the thalamus because of near lack of response to sensory inputs during sleep. However, this was invalidated because both regions are active in some phases of sleep. In fact, it appears that the thalamus is only deactivated in the sense of transmitting sensory information to the cortex. Some of the other observations about sleep included decrease of sympathetic activity and increase of parasympathetic activity in non-REM sleep, and increase of heart rate and blood pressure accompanied by decrease in homeostatic response and muscle tone during REM sleep. However, these symptoms are not limited to sleep situations and do not map to specific physiological definitions. More recently, the problem of definition has been addressed by observing overall brain activity in the form of characteristic EEG patterns. Each stage of sleep and wakefulness has a characteristic pattern of EEG which can be used to identify the stage of sleep. Waking is usually characterized by beta (12‚Äì30 Hz) and gamma (25‚Äì100 Hz) depending on whether there was a peaceful or stressful activity. The onset of sleep involves slowing down of this frequency to the drowsiness of alpha (8‚Äì12 Hz) and finally to theta (4‚Äì10 Hz) of Stage 1 NREM sleep. This frequency further decreases progressively through the higher stages of NREM and REM sleep. On the other hand, the amplitude of sleep waves is lowest during wakefulness (10‚Äì30ŒºV) and shows a progressive increase through the various stages of sleep. Stage 2 is characterized by sleep spindles (intermittent clusters of waves at sigma frequency i.e. 12‚Äì14 Hz) and K complexes (sharp upward deflection followed by slower downward deflection). Stage 3 sleep has more sleep spindles. Stages 3 and 4 have very high amplitude delta waves (0‚Äì4 Hz) and are known as slow wave sleep. REM sleep is characterized by low amplitude, mixed frequency waves. A sawtooth wave pattern is often present.  Ontogeny and phylogeny of sleep  Animal Sleep: Sleeping white tiger The questions of how sleep evolved in the animal kingdom and how it developed in humans are especially important because they might provide a clue to the functions and mechanisms of sleep respectively. =Sleep evolution = The evolution of different types of sleep patterns is influenced by a number of selective pressures, including body size, relative metabolic rate, predation, type and location of food sources, and immune function.McNamara, P., R. A. Barton, and C. L. Nunn. 2010, Evolution of sleep: Phylogenetic and functional perspectives. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.Preston, B. T., I. Capellini, P. McNamara, R. A. Barton, and C. L. Nunn. 2009. Parasite resistance and the adaptive significance of sleep. Bmc Evolutionary Biology 9. Sleep (especially deep SWS and REM) is tricky behavior because it steeply increases predation risk. This means that, for sleep to have evolved, the functions of sleep should have provided a substantial advantage over the risk it entails. In fact, studying sleep in different organisms shows how they have balanced this risk by evolving partial sleep mechanisms or by having protective habitats. Thus, studying the evolution of sleep might give a clue not only to the developmental aspects and mechanisms, but also to an adaptive justification for sleep. One challenge studying sleep evolution is that adequate sleep information is known only for two phyla of animals- chordata and arthropoda. With the available data, comparative studies have been used to determine how sleep might have evolved. One question that scientists try to answer through these studies is whether sleep evolved only once or multiple times. To understand this, they look at sleep patterns in different classes of animals whose evolutionary histories are fairly well-known and study their similarities and differences. Humans possess both slow wave and REM sleep, in both phases both eyes are closed and both hemispheres of the brain involved. Sleep has also been recorded in mammals other than humans. One study showed that echidnas possess only slow wave sleep (non-REM). This seems to indicate that REM sleep appeared in evolution only after therians. But this has later been contested by studies that claim that sleep in echidna combines both modes into a single sleeping state. Other studies have shown a peculiar form of sleep in odontocetes (like dolphins and porpoises). This is called the unihemispherical slow wave sleep (USWS). At any time during this sleep mode, the EEG of one brain hemisphere indicates sleep while that of the other is equivalent to wakefulness. In some cases, the corresponding eye is open. This might allow the animal to reduce predator risk and sleep while swimming in water, though the animal may also be capable of sleeping at rest. The correlates of sleep found for mammals are valid for birds as well i.e. bird sleep is very similar to mammals and involves both SWS and REM sleep with similar features, including closure of both eyes, lowered muscle tone, etc. However, the proportion of REM sleep in birds is much lower. Also, some birds can sleep with one eye open if there is high predation risk in the environment. This gives rise to the possibility of sleep in flight; considering that sleep is very important and some bird species can fly for weeks continuously, this seems to be the obvious result. However, sleep in flight has not been recorded, and is so far unsupported by EEG data. Further research may explain whether birds sleep during flight or if there are other mechanisms which ensure their remaining healthy during long flights in the absence of sleep. Unlike in birds, very few consistent features of sleep have been found among reptile species. The only common observation is that reptiles do not have REM sleep. Sleep in some invertebrates has also been extensively studied, e.g., sleep in fruitflies (Drosophila) and honeybees. Some of the mechanisms of sleep in these animals have been discovered while others remain quite obscure. The features defining sleep have been identified for the most part, and like mammals, this includes reduced reaction to sensory input, lack of motor response in the form of antennal immobility, etc. The fact that both the forms of sleep are found in mammals and birds, but not in reptiles (which are considered to be an intermediate stage) indicates that sleep might have evolved separately in both. Substantiating this might be followed by further research on whether the EEG correlates of sleep are involved in its functions or if they are merely a feature. This might further help in understanding the role of sleep in long term plasticity. According to Tsoukalas (2012), REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf. \\"playing possum\\"). The neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction show striking similarities to REM sleep, a fact which betrays a deep evolutionary kinship. For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, sympathetic activation, and thermoregulatory changes. This theory integrates many earlier findings into a unified, and evolutionary well informed, framework.Vitelli, R. (2013). Exploring the Mystery of REM Sleep. Psychology Today, On-line blog, 25 March = Sleep development and aging= The ontogeny of sleep is the study of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6‚Äì7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies. Sleep behavior undergoes substantial changes during adolescence. Some of these changes may be societal in humans, but other changes are hormonal. Another important change is the decrease in the number of hours of sleep, as compared to childhood, which gradually becomes identical to an adult. It is also being speculated that homeostatic regulation mechanisms may be altered during adolescence. Apart from this, the effect of changing routines of adolescents on other behavior such as cognition and attention is yet to be studied. Ohayon et al, for example, have stated that the decline in total sleep time from childhood to adolescence seems to be more associated with environmental factors rather than biological feature. In adulthood, the sleep architecture has been showing that the sleep latency and the time spent in NREM stages 1 and 2 may increase with aging, while the time spent in REM and SWS sleep seem to decrease. These changes have been frequently associated with brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders in old age.Mander, B., Rao, V., Lu, B., Saletin, J., Lindquist, J., Ancoli-Israel, S., . . . Walker, M. (2013). Prefrontal atrophy, disrupted NREM slow waves and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory in aging. 357 - 364. For instance, Backhaus et al have pointed out that a decline in declarative memory consolidation in midlife (in their experiment: 48 to 55 years old) is due to a lower amount of SWS, which might already start to decrease around age of 30 years old. According to Mander et al, atrophy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) gray matter is a predictor of disruption in slow activity during NREM sleep that may impair memory consolidation in older adults. And sleep disturbances, such as excessive daytime sleepiness and nighttime insomnia, have been often referred as factor risk of progressive functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, sleep in aging is another equally important area of research. A common observation is that many older adults spend time awake in bed after sleep onset in an inability to fall asleep and experience marked decrease in sleep efficiency. There may also be some changes in circadian rhythms. Studies are ongoing about what causes these changes and how they may be reduced to ensure comfortable sleep of old adults.  Brain activity during sleep  alt=Hypnogram showing sleep cycles from midnight to morning. Understanding the activity of different parts of the brain during sleep can give a clue to the functions of sleep. It has been observed that mental activity is present during all stages of sleep, though from different regions in the brain. So, contrary to popular understanding, the brain never completely shuts down during sleep. Also, sleep intensity of a particular region is homeostatically related to the corresponding amount of activity before sleeping. The use of imaging modalities like PET and fMRI, combined with EEG recordings, gives a clue to which brain regions participate in creating the characteristic wave signals and what their functions might be. = Historical development of the stages model = The stages of sleep were first described in 1937 by Alfred Lee Loomis and his coworkers, who separated the different electroencephalography (EEG) features of sleep into five levels (A to E), representing the spectrum from wakefulness to deep sleep. In 1953, REM sleep was discovered as distinct, and thus William C. Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman reclassified sleep into four NREM stages and REM. The staging criteria were standardized in 1968 by Allan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales in the \\"R&K; sleep scoring manual.\\" In the R&K; standard, NREM sleep was divided into four stages, with slow-wave sleep comprising stages 3 and 4. In stage 3, delta waves made up less than 50% of the total wave patterns, while they made up more than 50% in stage 4. Furthermore, REM sleep was sometimes referred to as stage 5. In 2004, the AASM commissioned the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R&K; scoring system. The review resulted in several changes, the most significant being the combination of stages 3 and 4 into Stage N3. The revised scoring was published in 2007 as The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. Arousals, respiratory, cardiac, and movement events were also added. = NREM sleep activity = NREM sleep is characterized by decreased global and regional cerebral blood flow. It constitutes ~80% of all sleep in adult humans.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, passim. Initially, it was expected that the brainstem, which was implicated in arousal would be inactive, but this was later on found to have been due to low resolution of PET studies and it was shown that there is some slow wave activity in the brainstem as well. However, other parts of the brain, including the precuneus, basal forebrain and basal ganglia are deactivated during sleep. Many areas of the cortex are also inactive, but to different levels. For example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is considered the least active area while the primary cortex, the least deactivated. NREM sleep is characterized by slow oscillations, spindles and delta waves. The slow oscillations have been shown to be from the cortex, as lesions in other parts of the brain do not affect them, but lesions in the cortex do. The delta waves have been shown to be generated by reciprocally connected thalamic and cortical neural circuits. During sleep, the thalamus stops relaying sensory information to the brain, however it continues to produce signals that are sent to its cortical projections. These waves are generated in the thalamus even in the absence of the cortex, but the cortical output seems to play a role in the simultaneous firing by large groups of neurons. The thalamic reticular nucleus is considered to be the pacemaker of the sleep spindles. This has been further substantiated by the fact that rhythmic stimulation of the thalamus leads to increased secondary depolarization in cortical neurons, which further results in the increased amplitude of firing, causing self-sustained activity. The sleep spindles have been predicted to play a role in disconnecting the cortex from sensory input and allowing entry of calcium ions into cells, thus potentially playing a role in Plasticity.  NREM 1  NREM Stage 1 (N1 ‚Äì light sleep, somnolence, drowsy sleep ‚Äì 5‚Äì10% of total sleep in adults): This is a stage of sleep that usually occurs between sleep and wakefulness, and sometimes occurs between periods of deeper sleep and periods of REM. The muscles are active, and the eyes roll slowly, opening and closing moderately. The brain transitions from alpha waves having a frequency of 8‚Äì13 Hz (common in the awake state) to theta waves having a frequency of 4‚Äì7 Hz. Sudden twitches and hypnic jerks, also known as positive myoclonus, may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1. Some people may also experience hypnagogic hallucinations during this stage. During Non-REM1, humans lose some muscle tone and most conscious awareness of the external environment.  NREM 2  NREM Stage 2 (N2 ‚Äì 45‚Äì55% of total sleep in adults): In this stage, theta activity is observed and sleepers become gradually harder to awaken; the alpha waves of the previous stage are interrupted by abrupt activity called sleep spindles (or thalamocortical spindles) and K-complexes. Sleep spindles range from 11 to 16 Hz (most commonly 12‚Äì14 Hz). During this stage, muscular activity as measured by EMG decreases, and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears.  NREM 3  30 seconds of N3 ‚Äì deep sleep. NREM Stage 3 (N3 ‚Äì 15‚Äì25% of total sleep in adults): Formerly divided into stages 3 and 4, this stage is called slow-wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. SWS is initiated in the preoptic area and consists of delta activity, high amplitude waves at less than 3.5 Hz. The sleeper is less responsive to the environment; many environmental stimuli no longer produce any reactions. Slow-wave sleep is thought to be the most restful form of sleep, the phase which most relieves subjective feelings of sleepiness and restores the body. This stage is characterized by the presence of a minimum of 20% delta waves ranging from 0.5‚Äì2 Hz and having a peak-to-peak amplitude >75 ŒºV. (EEG standards define delta waves to be from 0 to 4 Hz, but sleep standards in both the original R&K; model (Allan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales in the \\"R&K; sleep scoring manual.\\"),Brown, pp. 1108‚Äì1109. as well as the new 2007 AASM guidelines have a range of 0.5‚Äì2 Hz.) This is the stage in which parasomnias such as night terrors, nocturnal enuresis, sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur. Many illustrations and descriptions still show a stage N3 with 20‚Äì50% delta waves and a stage N4 with greater than 50% delta waves; these have been combined as stage N3. =REM sleep activity = 30 seconds of REM sleep. Eye movements highlighted by red box. REM Stage (REM Sleep ‚Äì 20‚Äì25% of total sleep in adults): REM sleep is where most muscles are paralyzed, and heart rate, breathing and body temperature become unregulated. REM sleep is turned on by acetylcholine secretion and is inhibited by neurons that secrete monoamines including serotonin. REM is also referred to as paradoxical sleep because the sleeper, although exhibiting high-frequency EEG waves similar to a waking state, is harder to arouse than at any other sleep stage. Vital signs indicate arousal and oxygen consumption by the brain is higher than when the sleeper is awake. REM sleep is characterized by high global cerebral blood flow, comparable to wakefulness. In fact, many areas in the cortex have been recorded to have more blood flow during REM sleep than even wakefulness- this includes the hippocampus, temporal-occipital areas, some parts of the cortex, and basal forebrain. The limbic and paralimbic system including the amygdala are other active regions during REM sleep. Though the brain activity during REM sleep appears very similar to wakefulness, the main difference between REM and wakefulness is that, arousal in REM is more effectively inhibited. This, along with the virtual silence of monoaminergic neurons in the brain, may be said to characterize REM. A newborn baby spends 8 to 9 hours a day just in REM sleep. By the age of five or so, only slightly over two hours is spent in REM. The function of REM sleep is uncertain but a lack of it impairs the ability to learn complex tasks. Functional paralysis from muscular atonia in REM may be necessary to protect organisms from self-damage through physically acting out scenes from the often-vivid dreams that occur during this stage. In EEG recordings, REM sleep is characterized by high frequency, low amplitude activity and spontaneous occurrence of beta and gamma waves. The best candidates for generation of these fast frequency waves are fast rhythmic bursting neurons in corticothalamic circuits. Unlike in slow wave sleep, the fast frequency rhythms are synchronized over restricted areas in specific local circuits between thalamocortical and neocortical areas. These are said to be generated by cholinergic processes from brainstem structures. Apart from this, the amygdala plays a role in REM sleep modulation, supporting the hypothesis that REM sleep allows internal information processing. The high amygdalar activity may also cause the emotional responses during dreams. Similarly, the bizarreness of dreams may be due to the decreased activity of prefrontal regions, which are involved in integrating information as well as episodic memory. = Ponto-geniculo-occipital waves = REM sleep is also related to the firing of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (also called phasic activity or PGO waves) and activity in the cholinergic ascending arousal system. The PGO waves have been recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex during the pre-REM period and are thought to represent dream content. The greater signal-to-noise ratio in the LG cortical channel suggests that visual imagery in dreams may appear before full development of REM sleep, but this has not yet been confirmed. PGO waves may also play a role in development and structural maturation of brain, as well as long term potentiation in immature animals, based on the fact that there is high PGO activity during sleep in the developmental brain. =Network reactivation = The other form of activity during sleep is reactivation. Some electrophysiological studies have shown that neuronal activity patterns found during a learning task before sleep are reactivated in the brain during sleep. This, along with the coincidence of active areas with areas responsible for memory have led to the theory that sleep might have some memory consolidation functions. In this relation, some studies have shown that after a sequential motor task, the pre-motor and visual cortex areas involved are most active during REM sleep, but not during NREM. Similarly, the hippocampal areas involved in spatial learning tasks are reactivated in NREM sleep, but not in REM. Such studies suggest a role of sleep in consolidation of specific memory types. It is, however, still unclear whether other types of memory are also consolidated by these mechanisms. = Hippocampal neocortical dialog = The hippocampal neocortical dialog refers to the very structured interactions during SWS between groups of neurons called ensembles in the hippocampus and neocortex. Sharp wave patterns (SPW) dominate the hippocampus during SWS and neuron populations in the hippocampus participate in organized bursts during this phase. This is done in synchrony with state changes in the cortex (DOWN/UP state) and coordinated by the slow oscillations in cortex. These observations, coupled with the knowledge that the hippocampus plays a role in short to medium term memory whereas the cortex plays a role in long term memory, have led to the hypothesis that the hippocampal neocortical dialog might be a mechanism through which the hippocampus transfers information to the cortex. Thus, the hippocampal neocortical dialog is said to play a role in memory consolidation. Sleep regulation  Sleep regulation refers to the control of when an organism transitions between sleep and wakefulness. The key questions here are to identify which parts of the brain are involved in sleep onset and what their mechanisms of action are. In humans and most animals sleep and wakefulness seems to follow an electronic flip-flop model i.e. both states are stable, but the intermediate states are not. Of course, unlike in the flip-flop, in the case of sleep, there seems to be a timer ticking away from the minute of waking so that after a certain period one must sleep, and in such a case even waking becomes an unstable state. The reverse may also be true to a lesser extent. =Sleep onset = Some light was thrown on the mechanisms on sleep onset by the discovery that lesions in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus lead to insomnia while those in the posterior hypothalamus lead to sleepiness. This was further narrowed down to show that the central midbrain tegmentum is the region that plays a role in cortical activation. Thus, sleep onset seems to arise from activation of the anterior hypothalamus along with inhibition of the posterior regions and the central midbrain tegmentum. Further research has shown that the hypothalamic region called ventrolateral preoptic nucleus produces the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA that inhibits the arousal system during sleep onset. =Models of sleep regulation= Sleep is regulated by two parallel mechanisms, homeostatic regulation and circadian regulation, controlled by the hypothalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), respectively. Although the exact nature of sleep drive is unknown, homeostatic pressure builds up during wakefulness and this continues until the person goes to sleep. Adenosine is thought to play a critical role in this and many people have proposed that the pressure build-up is partially due to adenosine accumulation. However, some researchers have shown that accumulation alone does not explain this phenomenon completely. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in the body, which has been shown to continue even in the absence of environmental cues. This is caused by projections from the SCN to the brain stem. This two process model was first proposed in 1982 by Borbely, who called them Process S (homeostatic) and Process C (Circadian) respectively. He showed how the slow wave density increases through the night and then drops off at the beginning of the day while the circadian rhythm is like a sinusoid. He proposed that the pressure to sleep was the maximum when the difference between the two was highest. In 1993, a different model called the opponent process model was proposed. This model explained that these two processes opposed each other to produce sleep, as against Borbely's model. According to this model, the SCN, which is involved in the circadian rhythm, enhances wakefulness and opposes the homeostatic rhythm. In opposition is the homeostatic rhythm, regulated via a complex multisynaptic pathway in the hypothalamus that acts like a switch and shuts off the arousal system. Both effects together produce a see-saw like effect of sleep and wakefulness. More recently, it has been proposed that both models have some validity to them, while new theories hold that inhibition of NREM sleep by REM could also play a role. In any case, the two process mechanism adds flexibility to the simple circadian rhythm and could have evolved as an adaptive measure. =Thalamic regulation= Much of the brain activity in sleep has been attributed to the thalamus and it appears that the thalamus may play a critical role in SWS. The two primary oscillations in slow wave sleep, delta and the slow oscillation, can be generated by both the thalamus and the cortex. However, sleep spindles can only be generated by the thalamus, making its role very important. The thalamic pacemaker hypothesis holds that these oscillations are generated by the thalamus but the synchronization of several groups of thalamic neurons firing simultaneously depends on the thalamic interaction with the cortex. The thalamus also plays a critical role in sleep onset when it changes from tonic to phasic mode, thus acting like a mirror for both central and decentral elements and linking distant parts of the cortex to co-ordinate their activity. =Ascending reticular activating system= The ascending reticular activating system consists of a set of neural subsystems that project from various thalamic nuclei and a number of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic brain nuclei. When awake, it receives all kinds of non-specific sensory information and relays them to the cortex. It also modulates fight or flight responses and is hence linked to the motor system. During sleep onset, it acts via two pathways: a cholinergic pathway that projects to the cortex via the thalamus and a set of monoaminergic pathways that projects to the cortex via the hypothalamus. During NREM sleep this system is inhibited by GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area and parafacial zone, as well as other sleep- promoting neurons in distinct brain regions.  Sleep function  The need and function of sleep are among the least clearly understood areas in sleep research. When asked, after 50 years of research, what he knew about the reason people sleep, William C. Dement, founder of Stanford University's Sleep Research Center, answered, \\"As far as I know, the only reason we need to sleep that is really, really solid is because we get sleepy.\\" It is likely that sleep evolved to fulfill some primeval function and took on multiple functions over time (analogous to the larynx, which controls the passage of food and air, but descended over time to develop speech capabilities). The multiple hypotheses proposed to explain the function of sleep reflect the incomplete understanding of the subject. While some functions of sleep are known, others have been proposed but not completely substantiated or understood. Some of the early ideas about sleep function were based on the fact that most (if not all) external activity is stopped during sleep. Initially, it was thought that sleep was simply a mechanism for the body to \\"take a break\\" and reduce wear. Later observations of the low metabolic rates in the brain during sleep seemed to indicate some metabolic functions of sleep. This theory is not fully adequate as sleep only decreases metabolism by about 5‚Äì10%.\\"Function of Sleep.\\". Scribd.com. Retrieved on 1 December 2011. With the development of EEG, it was found that the brain has almost continuous internal activity during sleep, leading to the idea that the function could be that of reorganization or specification of neuronal circuits or strengthening of connections. These hypotheses are still being explored. Other proposed functions of sleep include- maintaining hormonal balance, temperature regulation and maintaining heart rate. =Preservation= The \\"Preservation and Protection\\" theory holds that sleep serves an adaptive function. It protects the animal during that portion of the 24-hour day in which being awake, and hence roaming around, would place the individual at greatest risk.Choi, Charles Q. (25 August 2009) New Theory Questions Why We Sleep, LiveScience.com. Organisms do not require 24 hours to feed themselves and meet other necessities. From this perspective of adaptation, organisms are safer by staying out of harm's way, where potentially they could be prey to other, stronger organisms. They sleep at times that maximize their safety, given their physical capacities and their habitats. This theory fails to explain why the brain disengages from the external environment during normal sleep. However, the brain consumes a large proportion of the body's energy at any one time and preservation of energy could only occur by limiting its sensory inputs. Another argument against the theory is that sleep is not simply a passive consequence of removing the animal from the environment, but is a \\"drive\\"; animals alter their behaviors in order to obtain sleep. Therefore, circadian regulation is more than sufficient to explain periods of activity and quiescence that are adaptive to an organism, but the more peculiar specializations of sleep probably serve different and unknown functions. Moreover, the preservation theory needs to explain why carnivores like lions, which are on top of the food chain and thus have little to fear, sleep the most. It has been suggested that they need to minimize energy expenditure when not hunting. =Waste clearance from the brain= During sleep, metabolic waste products, such as immunoglobulins, protein fragments or intact proteins like beta-amyloid, may be cleared from the interstitium via a glymphatic system of lymph-like channels coursing along perivascular spaces and the astrocyte network of the brain. According to this model, hollow tubes between the blood vessels and astrocytes act like a spillway allowing drainage of cerebrospinal fluid carrying wastes out of the brain into systemic blood. Such mechanisms, which remain under preliminary research as of 2017, indicate potential ways in which sleep is a regulated maintenance period for brain immune functions and clearance of beta-amyloid, a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. =Restoration= Wound healing has been shown to be affected by sleep. It has been shown that sleep deprivation affects the immune system. It is now possible to state that \\"sleep loss impairs immune function and immune challenge alters sleep,\\" and it has been suggested that sleep increases white blood cell counts. A 2014 study found that depriving mice of sleep increased cancer growth and dampened the immune system's ability to control cancers.Peres, Judy (14 March 2012) A good reason to get your zzz's Chicago Tribune Health, retrieved 26 March 2014 The effect of sleep duration on somatic growth is not completely known. One study recorded growth, height, and weight, as correlated to parent-reported time in bed in 305 children over a period of nine years (age 1‚Äì10). It was found that \\"the variation of sleep duration among children does not seem to have an effect on growth.\\" It is well established that slow-wave sleep affects growth hormone levels in adult men. During eight hours' sleep, Van Cauter, Leproult, and Plat found that the men with a high percentage of SWS (average 24%) also had high growth hormone secretion, while subjects with a low percentage of SWS (average 9%) had low growth hormone secretion. There is some supporting evidence of the restorative function of sleep. The sleeping brain has been shown to remove metabolic waste products at a faster rate than during an awake state. While awake, metabolism generates reactive oxygen species, which are damaging to cells. In sleep, metabolic rates decrease and reactive oxygen species generation is reduced allowing restorative processes to take over. It is theorized that sleep helps facilitate the synthesis of molecules that help repair and protect the brain from these harmful elements generated during waking. The metabolic phase during sleep is anabolic; anabolic hormones such as growth hormones (as mentioned above) are secreted preferentially during sleep. Energy conservation could as well have been accomplished by resting quiescent without shutting off the organism from the environment, potentially a dangerous situation. A sedentary nonsleeping animal is more likely to survive predators, while still preserving energy. Sleep, therefore, seems to serve another purpose, or other purposes, than simply conserving energy. Another potential purpose for sleep could be to restore signal strength in synapses that are activated while awake to a \\"baseline\\" level, weakening unnecessary connections that to better facilitate learning and memory functions again the next day; this means the brain is forgetting some of the things we learn each day. = Endocrine function= The secretion of many hormones is affected by sleep-wake cycles. For example, melatonin, a hormonal timekeeper, is considered a strongly circadian hormone, whose secretion increases at dim light and peaks during nocturnal sleep, diminishing with bright light to the eyes. In some organisms melatonin secretion depends on sleep, but in humans it is independent of sleep and depends only on light level. Of course, in humans as well as other animals, such a hormone may facilitate coordination of sleep onset. Similarly, cortisol and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are strongly circadian and diurnal hormones, mostly independent of sleep. In contrast, other hormones like growth hormone (GH) & prolactin are critically sleep-dependent, and are suppressed in the absence of sleep. GH has maximum increase during SWS while prolactin is secreted early after sleep onset and rises through the night. In some hormones whose secretion is controlled by light level, sleep seems to increase secretion. Almost in all cases, sleep deprivation has detrimental effects. For example, cortisol, which is essential for metabolism (it is so important that animals can die within a week of its deficiency) and affects the ability to withstand noxious stimuli, is increased by waking and during REM sleep. Similarly, TSH increases during nocturnal sleep and decreases with prolonged periods of reduced sleep, but increases during total acute sleep deprivation. Because hormones play a major role in energy balance and metabolism, and sleep plays a critical role in the timing and amplitude of their secretion, sleep has a sizable effect on metabolism. This could explain some of the early theories of sleep function that predicted that sleep has a metabolic regulation role. = Memory processing = According to Plihal & Born, sleep generally increases recalling of previous learning and experiences, and its benefit depends on the phase of sleep and the type of memory. For example, studies based on declarative and procedural memory tasks applied over early and late nocturnal sleep, as well as wakefulness controlled conditions, have been shown that declarative memory improves more during early sleep (dominated by SWS) while procedural memory during late sleep (dominated by REM sleep). Regarding to declarative memory, the functional role of SWS has been associated with hippocampal replays of previously encoded neural patterns that seem to facilitate long-term memories consolidation. This assumption is based on the active system consolidation hypothesis, which states that repeated reactivations of newly encoded information in hippocampus during slow oscillations in NREM sleep mediate the stabilization and gradually integration of declarative memory with pre-existing knowledge networks on the cortical level. It assumes the hippocampus might hold information only temporarily and in fast-learning rate, whereas the neocortex is related to long-term storage and slow-learning rate. This dialogue between hippocampus and neocortex occurs in parallel with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and thalamo-cortical spindles, synchrony that drives the formation of spindle-ripple event which seems to be a prerequisite for the formation of long-term memories. Reactivation of memory also occurs during wakefulness and its function is associated with serving to update the reactivated memory with new encoded information, whereas reactivations during SWS are presented as crucial for memory stabilization. Based on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) experiments that use associated memory cues to triggering memory traces during sleep, several studies have been reassuring the importance of nocturnal reactivations for the formation of persistent memories in neocortical networks, as well as highlighting the possibility of increasing people‚Äôs memory performance at declarative recalls. Furthermore, nocturnal reactivation seems to share the same neural oscillatory patterns as reactivation during wakefulness, processes which might be coordinated by theta activity. During wakefulness, theta oscillations have been often related to successful performance in memory tasks, and cued memory reactivations during sleep have been showing that theta activity is significantly stronger in subsequent recognition of cued stimuli as compared to uncued ones, possibly indicating a strengthening of memory traces and lexical integration by cuing during sleep. However, the beneficial effect of TMR for memory consolidation seems to occur only if the cued memories can be related to prior knowledge.Groch, S., Schreiner, T., Rasch, B., Huber, R., & Wilhelm, I. (2017). Prior knowledge is essential for the beneficial effect of targeted memory reactivation during sleep. Scientific Reports, 7 Other studies have been also looking at the specific effects of different stages of sleep on different types of memory. For example, it has been found that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but can produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set shown). Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Another study reported that the performance on free recall of a list of nouns is significantly worse when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 ¬± 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 ¬± 4 words). These results reinforce the role of sleep on declarative memory formation. This has been further confirmed by observations of low metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex and temporal and parietal lobes for the temporal learning and verbal learning tasks respectively. Data analysis has also shown that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. Also, post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (1 hour), indicating long term potentiation. Moreover, observations include the importance of napping: improved performance in some kinds of tasks after a 1-hour afternoon nap; studies of performance of shift workers, showing that an equal number of hours of sleep in the day is not the same as in the night. Current research studies look at the molecular and physiological basis of memory consolidation during sleep. These, along with studies of genes that may play a role in this phenomenon, together promise to give a more complete picture of the role of sleep in memory. = Renormalizing the synaptic strength = Sleep can also serve to weaken synaptic connections that were acquired over the course of the day but which are not essential to optimal functioning. In doing so, the resource demands can be lessened, since the upkeep and strengthening of synaptic connections constitutes a large portion of energy consumption by the brain and tax other cellular mechanisms such as protein synthesis for new channels. Without a mechanism like this taking place during sleep, the metabolic needs of the brain would increase over repeated exposure to daily synaptic strengthening, up to a point where the strains become excessive or untenable. = Behavior change with sleep deprivation = One approach to understanding the role of sleep is to study the deprivation of it. Sleep deprivation is common and sometimes even necessary in modern societies because of occupational and domestic reasons like round-the-clock service, security or media coverage, cross-time-zone projects etc. This makes understanding the effects of sleep deprivation very important. Many studies have been done from the early 1900s to document the effect of sleep deprivation. The study of REM deprivation began with William C. Dement more than fifty years ago. He conducted a sleep and dream research project on eight subjects, all male. For a span of up to 7 days, he deprived the participants of REM sleep by waking them each time they started to enter the stage. He monitored this with small electrodes attached to their scalp and temples. As the study went on, he noticed that the more he deprived the men of REM sleep, the more often he had to wake them. Afterwards, they showed more REM sleep than usual, later named REM rebound. The neurobehavioral basis for these has been studied only recently. Sleep deprivation has been strongly correlated with increased probability of accidents and industrial errors. Many studies have shown the slowing of metabolic activity in the brain with many hours of sleep debt. Some studies have also shown that the attention network in the brain is particularly affected by lack of sleep, and though some of the effects on attention may be masked by alternate activities (like standing or walking) or caffeine consumption, attention deficit cannot be completely avoided. Sleep deprivation has been shown to have a detrimental effect on cognitive tasks, especially involving divergent functions or multitasking. It also has effects on mood and emotion, and there have been multiple reports of increased tendency for rage, fear or depression with sleep debt. However, some of the higher cognitive functions seem to remain unaffected albeit slower. Many of these effects vary from person to person i.e. while some individuals have high degrees of cognitive impairment with lack of sleep, in others, it has minimal effects. The exact mechanisms for the above are still unknown and the exact neural pathways and cellular mechanisms of sleep debt are still being researched.  Sleep disorders  A sleep disorder, or somnipathy, is a medical disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Polysomnography is a test commonly used for diagnosing some sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm sleep disorders(CRSD), and other disorders including ones caused by medical or psychological conditions and sleeping sickness. Some common sleep disorders include insomnia (chronic inability to sleep), sleep apnea (abnormally low breathing during sleep), narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times), cataplexy (sudden and transient loss of muscle tone), and sleeping sickness (disruption of sleep cycle due to infection). Other disorders that are being studied include sleepwalking, sleep terror and bed wetting. Studying sleep disorders is particularly useful as it gives some clues as to which parts of the brain may be involved in the modified function. This is done by comparing the imaging and histological patterns in normal and affected subjects. Treatment of sleep disorders typically involves behavioral and psychotherapeutic methods though other techniques may also be used. The choice of treatment methodology for a specific patient depends on the patient's diagnosis, medical and psychiatric history, and preferences, as well as the expertise of the treating clinician. Often, behavioral or psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches are compatible and can effectively be combined to maximize therapeutic benefits. Frequently, sleep disorders have been also associated with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly when they are characterized by abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body disease (LBD). For instance, people diagnosed with PD have often presented different kinds of sleep concerns, commonly regard to insomnia (around 70% of the PD population), hypersomnia (more than 50% of the PD population), and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) - that may affect around 40% of the PD population and it is associated with increased motor symptoms. Furthermore, RBD has been also highlighted as a strong precursor of future development of those neurodegenerative diseases over several years in prior, which seems to be a great opportunity for improving treatments. Sleep disturbances have been also observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting about 45% of its population. Moreover, when it is based on caregiver reports this percentage is even higher, about 70%.Dick-Muehlke, C. (2015). Psychosocial studies of the individual's changing perspectives in Alzheimer's disease (Premier Reference Source). Hershey, PA: Medical Information Science Reference. As well as in PD population, insomnia and hypersomnia are frequently recognized in AD patients, which are associated with accumulation of Beta-amyloid, circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) and melatonin alteration. Additionally, changes in sleep architecture are observed in AD too. Even though with ageing the sleep architecture seems to change naturally, in AD patients it is aggravated. SWS is potentially decreased (sometimes totally absent), spindles and the time spent in REM sleep are also reduced, while its latency is increased. The poorly sleep onset in AD has been also associated with dream-related hallucination, increased restlessness, wandering and agitation, that seem to be related with sundowning - a typical chronobiological phenomenon presented in the disease. The neurodegenerative conditions are commonly related to brain structures impairments, which might disrupt the states of sleep and wakefulness, circadian rhythm, motor or non motor functioning. On the other hand, sleep disturbances are also frequently related to worsening patient's cognitive functioning, emotional state and quality of life. Furthermore, these abnormal behavioural symptoms negatively contribute to overwhelming their relatives and caregivers. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and neurodegenerative diseases seems to be extremely important, mainly considering the limited research related to it and the increasing expectancy of life. A related field is that of sleep medicine which involves the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disorders and sleep deprivation, which is a major cause of accidents. This involves a variety of diagnostic methods including polysomnography, sleep diary, multiple sleep latency test, etc. Similarly, treatment may be behavioral such as cognitive behavioral therapy or may include pharmacological medication or bright light therapy.  Dreaming  \\"The Knight's Dream\\", a 1655 painting by Antonio de Pereda Dreams are successions of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep (mainly the REM stage). The content and purpose of dreams are not yet clearly understood though various theories have been proposed. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology. There are many theories about the neurological basis of dreaming. This includes the activation synthesis theory‚Äîthe theory that dreams result from brain stem activation during REM sleep; the continual activation theory‚Äîthe theory that dreaming is a result of activation and synthesis but dreams and REM sleep are controlled by different structures in the brain; and dreams as excitations of long term memory‚Äîa theory which claims that long term memory excitations are prevalent during waking hours as well but are usually controlled and become apparent only during sleep. There are multiple theories about dream function as well. Some studies claim that dreams strengthen semantic memories. This is based on the role of hippocampal neocortical dialog and general connections between sleep and memory. One study surmises that dreams erase junk data in the brain. Emotional adaptation and mood regulation are other proposed functions of dreaming. From an evolutionary standpoint, dreams might simulate and rehearse threatening events, that were common in the organism's ancestral environment, hence increasing a persons ability to tackle everyday problems and challenges in the present. For this reason these threatening events may have been passed on in the form of genetic memories. This theory accords well with the claim that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. Most theories of dream function appear to be conflicting, but it is possible that many short-term dream functions could act together to achieve a bigger long-term function. It may be noted that evidence for none of these theories is entirely conclusive. The incorporation of waking memory events into dreams is another area of active research and some researchers have tried to link it to the declarative memory consolidation functions of dreaming. A related area of research is the neuroscience basis of nightmares. Many studies have confirmed a high prevalence of nightmares and some have correlated them with high stress levels. Multiple models of nightmare production have been proposed including neo-Freudian models as well as other models such as image contextualization model, boundary thickness model, threat simulation model etc. Neurotransmitter imbalance has been proposed as a cause of nightmares, as also affective network dysfunction- a model which claims that nightmare is a product of dysfunction of circuitry normally involved in dreaming. As with dreaming, none of the models have yielded conclusive results and studies continue about these questions.

Until 1977 Moelingen was a municipality of its own. In that year it became part of the Voeren municipality. In this village, like in all of the Belgian (as well as the neighbouring Dutch) province of Limburg, predominantly \\"Limburgs\\" is spoken, a Low Frankish dialect, closely related to Flemish. Geography Berwinne river, some 50 meters from the place where it flows into the Meuse river Moelingen is the westernmost of the six villages that together form the Voeren municipality It is located in the valley of the Meuse river and on the river Berwinne (Berwijn), which, a little further westward, flows into the Meuse. Further westward, across the Meuse river, the southern end of the Caestert Plateau (part of the Mount Saint Peter) is situated, as well as the village of Lieze (in French \\"Lixhe\\"), which is part of the Wallonian Wezet (in French \\"Vis√©\\") municipality. On its north side, Moelingen abuts the Belgian border with the Netherlands, just south of , a hamlet in the Dutch municipality of Eijsden-Margraten.

Of noble descent, Mochtar was discovered by Albert Balink and first cast in the commercial failure Pareh (1936). Rising to popularity after the release of Terang Boelan the following year, he spent nearly sixty years in film, while also becoming a businessman and farmer. Childhood and early career Mochtar was born in Cianjur, West Java, in 1918. He was a Javanese of priyayi (noble) descent. He did his elementary school studies at a Taman Siswa school in Bandung. Mochtar and his wife, Sukarsih, in 1953 In 1935 Mochtar was cast in the leading role of Mahmud in Albert Balink's film Pareh. Balink was out with coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw Mochtar, whom he considered tall, strong, and handsome, driving by. Balink and the Wongs chased Mochtar in their car and caught him. For the film Mochtar was told to use the title Raden, which he and his family had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience. The film, which cost 75,000 gulden to produce, was a commercial failure. However, it was financially beneficial for Mochtar, who was paid a monthly retainer of 250 gulden. Balink recalled Mochtar for his next film, Terang Boelan (Full Moon), in 1937. Although the role called for Mochtar to sing he was unable to do so. As such, the composer Ismail Marzuki was called to provide Mochtar's singing voice. The film was a commercial success, garnering over 200,000 Singapore dollars during its international release. This led to Mochtar becoming a bankable star and often playing alongside Roekiah. The film also played a role in the establishment of a star system in the country's cinema. Soon after the release of Terang Boelan Mochtar married the actress Soekarsih, whom he had met on the set of Pareh. After the success of Terang Boelan and Balink's emigration to the United States, most of the cast ‚Äì including Mochtar ‚Äì were signed with Tan's Film. Mochtar's first film with the company, Fatima (1938), was a commercial success, earning 200,000 gulden on a 7,000 gulden budget. After making several further films, by 1940 Mochtar had left Tan's over a wage dispute. He made a further three films with Yo Kim Tjan's Populair Films before transferring to Action Film. Later career During the Japanese occupation (1942‚Äì1945) and ensuing four-year revolution, Mochtar acted in several theatrical groups, including Terang Boelan, Bintang Soerabaja, and Pantai Warna. As the Indonesian film industry gained steam during the 1950s, Mochtar continued acting. Aside from Indonesian films, he also had a role in Rodrigo de Villa, by the Philippine company LVN Pictures. In the late 1950s the local film industry ebbed and Mochtar became a businessman, then later a farmer. In the mid-1960s he went on the hajj to Mecca, and in the 1970s he began acting again. During this period he received awards from both the West Javan and Jakartan governments for his acting. He continued to be active in film until 1991.

It was reactivated in 2015 as an Air Combat Command unit of Ninth Air Force (9 AF), flying alongside the South Carolina Air National Guard's 169th Fighter Wing at McEntire Joint National Guard Base, South Carolina. History The 316th Fighter Squadron was activated in mid-1942 under I Fighter Command at Mitchel Field, New York as one of the original squadrons of the 324th Fighter Group. The squadron trained at Byrd Field, Virginia. The first three and a half months were spent in training, and the men of the 316th absorbed the various techniques of aerial combat.Brief History of the 316 Fighter Squadron 1942‚Äì1956, Prepared by USAF Historical Division Research Studies Institute Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama July 1956 On 9 October overseas shipment orders arrived, and on the 27th the men boarded a train in Norfolk and arrived at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey the next day. The air echelon had left earlier for Miami Army Air Field, Florida, and were later flown by easy stages along the South Atlantic Air Transport Route via the Caribbean and Brazil to the squadron's destination ‚Äì North Africa and the Ninth Air Force. On Halloween day 1942 the ground echelon boarded the USS West Point, formerly the luxury liner America, which left New York early on 1 November. The squadron was berthed on the lowest deck, promptly tagged \\"Torpedo Junction\\" by some wag, and the men settled down to days of sickness and boredom. The monotony was somewhat relieved by the sight of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but no one was allowed ashore. On 12 November the West Point left Rio for the long haul to India, arriving at Bombay on 2 December. The squadron's equipment was unloaded, and the men were put on a train and sent to British Army rest camp at Deolali, India. They spent several days there stretching their \\"sea legs\\" in preparation for the next phase of the trip. The cleanliness and luxury of Deolali was a welcome respite from the crowded conditions common to troopships. On 13 December the 316th boarded HMS Denera, and three days later the men disembarked in Egypt. By 23 December the squadron was at RAF El Amiriya (Landing Ground LG-174), Egypt, and a period of training under combat- wise Royal Air Force supervisors followed. =Western Desert Campaign= The great offensive to oust the Nazis from Africa had begun with the English assault on Rommel's Afrika Korps at El Alamein on 23 October. The 316th was assigned to help the British advance, but it was not until 15 March that its pilots were deemed ready for combat. The day before the squadron went into action it was transferred to Causeway Landing Ground, Tunisia and attached to the 79th Fighter Group, and they flew several missions under their tutelage before being allowed to operate as an independent organization. The British Eighth Army began its final assault on the German Mareth Line (on the border of Tunisia and Tripoli) on 20 March, and six days later the 316th received its baptism of fire while supporting the offensive. The squadron's Curtiss P-40 Warhawks attacked an intersection near El Hamma, leaving six enemy vehicles burning on the road. Despite heavy ack-ack all aircraft returned safely with the exception of Major Frederick G. Delany's (the squadron commander). Because of leg wounds, he was forced to land at an English field near the front; and unfortunately, he never returned to the squadron. The unit flew mainly ground support missions during the remainder of the Tunisian campaign, but it also mounted armed reconnaissance, counter-air, bomber escort, and destroyer cover operations in that period. On 8 May the squadron bagged its first kill in aerial combat. A flight was returning from a dive bombing mission over the rapidly shrinking enemy bridgehead in Africa when the pilots saw three Messerschmitt Bf 109s dive from out of the sun on the flight Leader, Captain Robert C. Dempsey. The Germans had the bad luck not to spot the rest of the flight, and when they turned to get Captain Dempsey they were pounced on by fourteen fighters. Two of the enemy planes turned tail and escaped, but one went down in flames. On 11 May the Tunisian campaign ended. =Sicily Campaign= On 2 June the squadron was transferred to El Haouaria Airfield, Tunisia in order to rejoin its parent, the 324th Fighter Group, and for several weeks rested from the rigors of campaigning. The 316th resumed bombing escort operations during July. Preparations for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily were underway, and 10 July was designated as D-Day. The squadron was assigned the task of helping provide air cover for the invasion. On 9 July, while it was providing top cover for a group of Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers, a formation of squadron planes was jumped by over fifty Bf 109s. The sky was soon filled with dog fights. The 316th bore the brunt of the attack when its planes attempted to draw the enemy away from the bombers. The pilots put into play the P-40's two greatest assets, firepower and maneuverability, and dueled with the Germans for over ten minutes. The sky was filled with exploding planes, floating parachutes, fluttering shreds of wings and tails, streaks of oily smoke, and the criss-cross of tracers. The enemy could not stand this defense and turned for home. The trim P-40's streaked or limped, according to combat results, back to Tunisia and the 316th found that it had destroyed eight German planes during the action. On invasion day the squadron, along with the rest of the 324th group, put the first American fighters over the beachhead, and the unit continued to provide air cover and close support until the Allied grip on the island was assured. Although its home base remained in Africa, the 316th flew many missions from a primitive airfield only recently captured from the enemy. Many night landings were made on ill- equipped and ill-lit field, but there were no accidents involving the squadron. At the end of the Sicilian campaign the entire group was transferred to Twelfth Air Force, and the pilots received a brief respite from combat. The 316th was given the job of training newly arrived pilots in all the subtleties of combat. The men began to chafe under this mundane unexciting duty, and they welcomed orders alerting the squadron for transfer to Italy. =Italian Campaign= On 27 October part of the unit left for Italy, but it was not until 7 November that it was fully operational at Cercola Airfield. By mid- November the skies brightened and the squadron was able to press home its attacks. Its primary role became the close support of Fifth Army ground troops. On 10 May 1944 the squadron moved a few miles closer to Rome when it shifted operations to Pignataro Maggiore Airfield. The final phase of the Rome-Arno campaign opened that month with the American Fifth and British Eighth Armies driving up both sides of the Italian \\"boot\\". The Germans had heavily fortified the little town of Castellonorato, but surrendered without firing a shot after attacks by the 324th group. The group received a Presidential Unit Citation for these raids. On 7 June 1944, just after Rome fell, the squadron moved to La Banca, near Anzio, where their brief stay was highlighted by night bombing by a lone German aircraft. On 19 July the Squadron was temporarily withdrawn from combat in order to switch from P-40s to Republic P-47D Thunderbolts. The unit left Italy on 18 July, and by the 19th it was operating out of an airfield near Ghisonaccia, Corsica, flying armed reconnaissance sweeps over southern France; patrolling the coasts; and escorting medium bombers of the Twelfth Air Force. =Invasion of Southern France= 316th Fighter Squadron Republic P-47D-30-RA Thunderbolt, AAF Ser. No. 44-19726. On 15 August the Invasion of Southern France was made on the French Rivera, and the 316th mounted many missions against radar installations near the invasion beaches. On D-Day the squadron helped maintain fighter cover over the invading troops, and several troublesome strong points were eliminated by the unit's planes. On 21 August a small party of the 316th went ashore in southern France after a three-day ride on an LST, and they immediately began preparing the captured field at Le Luc Airport for the arrival of the squadron's planes. After only two days at Le Luc the squadron moved to Istres/Le Tub√© Airfield, and on 5 September the ground echelon left for Amberieu Airfield by truck. On 17 September the unit moved to Dole/Tavaux Airfield. The squadron found Tavaux comparatively luxurious, especially when the monotonous diet of C-rations ended as the supply columns finally caught up with the front. The German counterattack in the Ardennes occurred in mid- December, and the squadron moved northward to Luneville Airfield, France, on 2 January 1945 to help blunt the enemy thrust. On 5 January the squadron was operating from the Luneville strip. Throughout January and February the 316th's fighters flew close support missions and launched interdiction attacks against the enemy in the Ardennes salient. Intense cold, frequent snow storms, and a lack of supplies severely hampered operations during the winter, but the squadron performed invaluable service in helping turn the German attack into a disastrous defeat. =Western Allied Invasion of Germany= On 15 March the Seventh Army began its final offensive, and the squadron was up at the light of day to help support the attack. During the drive the 316th flew several missions a day in support of troops which were smashing their way through the Siegfried Line. On 14 April the squadron played a great part in the destruction of an enemy convoy, containing an estimated 500 vehicles that had become stalled about 15 miles northeast of Nuremberg. When the Thunderbolts finally departed they left a highway filled with destroyed transport and dead enemy troops. It was believed that the enemy convoy had been trying to escape an armored thrust further north of Nuremberg, but they only succeeded in being \\"blitzed\\" from the air. On 3 May the flight echelon moved to AAF Station Stuttgart/Echterdingen, Germany, in the wake of the advancing Sixth Army Group, but the ground crews did not reach the new base until V-E Day, 8 May 1945. The squadron became part of the United States Air Forces Europe army of occupation. It returned to the United States and was inactivated 7 November 1945 with its group at Camp Shanks, New York. =Active Duty Associate Unit= 169th Fighter Wing F-16CJ, AF Ser. No. 93-0535, flown by the 316th Fighter Squadron In 2015, the 316th Fighter Squadron was reactivated as part of the 495th Fighter Group at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. As a Regular Air Force Active Associate unit, the 316 FS is embedded in the South Carolina Air National Guard's 169th Fighter Wing at nearby McEntire Joint National Guard Base, sharing the same F-16CJ/DJ Block 52 aircraft.

Chesnutt and published in the collection The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color-Line (1899).Cutter 2010, p. 39. The story takes place in the United States in the early 1850s,Chesnutt 2008, p. 149. at the time of anti-slavery sentiment and the abolitionist movement in the northern states, and after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. In Chesnutt's story, the aspect of racial passing is addressed on both a narrative and textual level in order to illustrate a \\"destabilization of constructs of race, identity, and finally of textuality itself\\".Cutter 2010, p. 40. Plot summary \\"The Passing of Grandison\\" starts with a conversation between Dick Owens and Charity Lomax. Charity tells Dick that if he did something she considered heroic, she could be convinced to fall in love with him and marry him. For this reason, Dick decides to help one of the slaves of his father's plantation to escape to the North. He chooses this particular way to impress Charity because she admires the courage of a man from Ohio, who tried to help another man's slave gain freedom but was unsuccessful and, as a consequence, was jailed. The man died of a disease shortly after being imprisoned. To achieve freeing one of his father's slaves, Dick decides to go on a trip north and take his slave Tom along; he is convinced Tom will use any opportunity to escape and Dick will achieve his goal very easily. However, Colonel Owens, Dick's father, is opposed to his son's being accompanied by Tom as he is convinced that the slave will escape and constitute a property loss. Instead he suggests that Dick take Tom's brother, Grandison. He suggests that his son ask Grandison about his status as a slave to ensure that he is trustworthy and will not try to escape. Dick takes Grandison with him to New York City and Boston, and then to Niagara Falls, New York, where he even crosses to the Canadian side. (Great Britain had by then abolished slavery in Canada and other colonies in the Western Hemisphere.) Despite having numerous opportunities to escape, Grandison does not run away and refuses abolitionists' attempts to persuade him to flee into freedom. Dick decides to have Grandison kidnapped to get him out of view in order to appear to have helped the slave gain freedom when he reports back to Charity. Four weeks after Dick Owens' return to his father's plantation in Kentucky and one week after his marriage to Charity Lomax, Grandison returned to the property. He was welcomed and celebrated as a loyal slave, as he confirmed Colonel Owens' positive understanding of slavery. The colonel gave Grandison a place as a house servant. After about three weeks, Grandison and his family (his new wife, his parents and his three siblings) go missing. Colonel Owens' view on slavery is shaken when he discovers the slaves have escaped. He searches for the fugitives and last sees them on a small steamboat crossing Lake Erie toward Canada, where they will be free.

Analyses and interpretations =Theme of passing on the narrative level= On the narrative level (between the characters of the short story), the theme of passing destabilizes binary oppositions of \\"appearance\\" and \\"reality\\", \\"good\\" and \\"bad slave\\", as well \\"master\\" and \\"mastered\\". Grandison's performance of being a loyal slave As the title announces, the theme of passing is a major issue in the short story, \\"The Passing of Grandison\\". The kind of passing addressed, however, is not racial passing (since the slave Grandison does not pass for white) or any other form of passing in the traditional sense.Montgomery 2010, p. 10. Rather, Grandison passes for a contented and devoted slave, who is therefore selected to accompany his master's son, Dick Owens, on a trip north. Grandison seems to have \\"adopted the racist discourse of the slave system\\",Cutter 2010, p. 41. which Colonel Owens, in the story, describes as a \\"blissful relationship of kindly protection on the one hand, of wise subordination and loyal dependence on the other\\".Chesnutt 2008, p. 159. Grandison's \\"performance,\\" or masking, convinces the colonel, that \\"Grandison typified the best qualities possessed by his bondsmen: humility, loyalty, and servility\\".Taxel 1975, p. 108. In \\"The Mask as Theme and Structure: Charles W. Chesnutt's 'The Sheriff's Children' and 'The Passing of Grandison, P. Jay Delmar lists four events in the story that highlight Grandison's successful masking: his dialogue with Colonel Owens, who interviews Grandison to see whether he was \\"abolitionist-proof\\"Chesnutt 2008, p. 162. and suitable to accompany Dick on his journey. Grandison replied affirmatively to the colonel's question as to whether he believed himself to lead a better life than \\"free negroes\\", and confirmed the colonel's positive view of slavery.Delmar 1979, p. 371-372. Second, Grandison resisted Northern abolitionists' attempts to convince him to leave Owens.Delmar 1979, p. 371. Grandison's repeated \\"pass[ing] on freedom\\"Montgomery 2010, p. 13. confirms and reinforces Dick's conviction that Grandison was a loyal slave. When Dick returned after a short trip to find that Grandison had not touched the money he had left him, Owens thought this meant that Grandison \\"... sensibly recognized his true place in the economy of civilization, and kept it with such touching fidelity\\".Chesnutt 2008, p. 167. Grandison performed his role of being the loyal slave and appeared to have internalized his status as a slave. Third, in response to Dick's decision on a trip across the Niagara River to Canada, Grandison appears to be afraid to lose sight of his master and worries that he \\"won' hab no marster, an' won't nebber be able to git back home no mo.Chesnutt 2008, p. 169. Grandison remains by his master's side or waits for him on Dick's instruction. Dick decides to have Grandison kidnapped in order to appear to have helped him achieve freedom, and returns alone to his plantation in Kentucky. Grandison again proves his loyalty by returning to his master's plantation. Grandison's manner of speech is another way he encourages the trust of his masters.Osinubi 2010, p. 57. His use of dialect \\"marks his social and economic status\\" and \\"is mistaken for ignorance\\" by the white men. Grandison's masking as Sambo According to Joel Taxel, Grandison's performance in certain aspects conforms to historian Stanley Elkins' definition of the characteristics of the stereotypical plantation slave, the Sambo model, in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life: > ... docile but irresponsible, loyal but lazy, humble but chronically given > to lying and stealing; his behavior full of infantile silliness and his talk > inflated with childish exaggeration. His relationship with his master was > one of utter dependence and childlike attachment: it was indeed this > childlike quality that was the very key to his being.qtd. in Taxel 1975, p. > 105. The Sambo character was not a result of \\"internally controlled accommodation\\", but was a vital and reasonable adjustment to the hardships suffered, as well as an adjustment to the \\"dependency of a closed system\\". Taxel suggested that the Sambo character was an \\"externally imposed adjustment\\" by enslaved persons.Taxel 1975, p. 105. In Taxel's opinion, the short story's focus on Grandison's performance of loyalty and childlike behavior reflected two elements characteristic of the Sambo type. Grandison performs according to the Sambo-mask and thus the \\"false mask of Blackness\\", a mask responding to his master's expectations, with the goal of surviving and eventually escaping slavery. By his performance, Grandison first gains the trust of the Colonel and his son, and, secondly, confirms his master's opinion of his slave's having adopted the qualities most valued: \\"humility, loyalty, and servility\\". Grandison's escape Grandison conforms to expectations up until escaping with his family. According to Martha J. Cutter, this can be seen as the \\"passing away\\", or dying, of his performing \\"the persona of the passive, stupid, Sambo-like slave\\".Cutter 2010, p. 43. Grandison does not escape on the Owens' son's journey and returns to the plantation to be reunited with his family.Delmar 1979, p. 374. Wearing the mask of the Sambo character and thereby passing for \\"a contended, ignorant, childlike, happy slave who appears to believe the distorted visions of the world put forward by his white master\\" allows him to gain his master's trust and, through repeatedly proving his loyalty, he achieves his own and his family's freedom. Grandison's successful passing is the result both of his own efforts and of the shared belief by the Colonel and Dick Owens that \\"slavery is a sophisticated form of chivalry\\";Delmar 1979, p. 372. these elements help Grandison deceive them. Kim Kirkpatrick suggests another reason for Grandison to adopt the Sambo-like character: Colonel Owens promises that he can marry Betty, the enslaved maid, after he returns if he has pleased the son. The promise of marriage to the woman he loves is used to reward Grandison, while the Colonel subtly uses Betty as a kind of hostage.Kirkpatrick 2009, p. 107-108. =Grandison as a trickster= Grandison's deception of the colonel and Dick Owens by masking and performing the stereotypical Sambo can be compared to the trickster figure in African-American literature,Montgomery 2010, p. 8. African stories, and stories of the African diaspora.Osinubi 2010, p. 49. The end of the short story shows that Grandison has been masking in order to gain freedom not only for himself but also for his family. He is \\"a trickster-like, multi-faceted individual emerges from behind the mask of the Sambo doll\\".Cutter 2010, p. 44. Viktor Osinubi further explains that > the parallels between the adventures of a trickster figure and Grandison's > tortuous scheme for freedom highlight the connection between Grandison's > constructed presence in front of his powerful adversaries (his slave > masters) and the African metaphysics of presence, in which veiling one's > presence is an essential strategy for continued existence or the pursuit of > freedom. Grandison uses the colonel's belief that he has a secure knowledge of the behavior and culture of slaves by reconfirming it through \\"[t]otal subordination, veiled presence, and masked speech\\".Osinubi 2010, p. 60. He creates opportunities for subterfuge, and proves his loyalty by returning to the plantation. These reinforce the colonel's positive view of slavery and sense of Grandison's gratitude. Through \\"the reversal of polarities, particularly of the master-servant relationship, of truth and falseness, of knowledge and ignorance, and of autonomy and control,\\" Grandison achieves freedom. When the colonel realizes he has been tricked and that Grandison's behavior had been a performance, his view of slavery is shaken and his concepts of racial identity destabilized. To escape slavery, Grandison needed to act both as \\"a cunning resister of slavery\\" and as a Sambo at the same time. =Autonomy and freedom= As a slave, Grandison has constraints on his self-determination and freedom of action. But he enacts agency when he rejects Owens' attempt to help him acquire freedom, and later achieves freedom through his own actions and choices.Osinubi 2010, p. 58. In \\"The Passing of Grandison,\\" the hierarchy between autonomy and control in the sense of lack of freedom is destabilized. Grandison chooses the means and time of his escape. As Grandison achieves freedom through his own actions, \\"his lack of autonomy does not disempower him\\".Osinubi 2010, p. 59. As a result, the attributes of the master and the slave classes are reversed: > In the new relationship that Chesnutt sets up, the bourgeois class of slave > masters loses the attributes of knowledge and sophistication to the slave > class, while the slave class liberates itself from the attributes of > ignorance and naivety, effectively demonstrating that ignorance and naivety > belong equally to the slave masters. Colonel Owens's \\"reading\\" of Grandison Colonel Owens is convinced he is able to \\"read\\" his slaves' minds and behavior, meaning to understand them and their views of slavery and their master. But, the ending reveals that the Colonel is \\"completely in the dark about what Grandison and the other slaves are really thinking, feeling, and doing\\".Cutter 2010, p. 47. Grandison's performance deceives the colonel and enables the slave to escape with his family. As a result, the colonel's view on slavery is shaken, if not completely destroyed. His inability to understand and define his slaves in binary categories is revealed. Colonel Owens is deceived \\"by Grandison's mask of 'samboism. After Grandison's \\"pass[ing] on to freedom\\" with his family, the colonel and his son are \\"silenced,\\" as they are not allowed \\"any further speech in the story\\".Kirkpatrick 2009, p. 107. In the last part of the text, Colonel Owens \\"reacts to his former slave rather than leading him\\" [emphasis in original]. =Theme of passing on the textual level= On the textual level (between the text and the reader), passing also appears. The text passes for something that it is not, and thereby destabilizes the reader's \\"reading\\" of race, as well as changes the reader's approach to texts addressing racial issues.Cutter 2010, p. 39-40. Along with the theme of passing on the narrative level, Chesnutt's short story \\"enact[s] a profound destabilization of constructs of race, identity, and finally of textuality itself\\". The text's passing for something it is not can be divided into four parts, according to the four parts of the short story. The first part of the text passes for a \\"romance.\\" The story's first sentence, \\"when it is said that it was done to please a woman, there ought perhaps to be enough said to explain anything; for what a man will not do to please a woman has yet to be discovered\\" suggests the text is about the relationship of a man and a woman, likely Dick Owens and Charity Lomax, since the story continues with a conversation between the two. It distracts the reader's focus on Grandison as the central character and the narrative of his escape. In addition, the text's narrative perspective diverts the reader from associating the text's story as one that criticizes slavery. Therefore, the voice of narration and viewpoint conceal the short story's focus. The second and third sections pass as a \\"plantation tradition narrative\\". Martha J. Cutter argues, in reference to other critics, that \\"The Passing of Grandison\\" imitates and ridicules the tradition of the post-Civil War southern plantation school of writing that portrayed slavery as a benevolent' patriarchal institution\\". She explains that the short story refers to this school of writing by its portrayal of Grandison as a happy and contented slave.Cutter 2010, p. 45. Grandison speaks in a dialect associated with slaves and serves his master loyally on his journey into the north of the United States and to Canada, not responding to Owens' efforts to encourage the slave to escape. The fourth part passes for an inverted slave narrative. Grandison, having been kidnapped, returns to his master's plantation and is \\"keeping his back steadily to the North Star\\".Chesnutt 2008, p. 176. In slave narratives, the fugitives follow the North Star in pursuit of freedom and are welcomed by abolitionists when they reach the northern states. Reversing the narrative, Grandison refuses abolitionists' offers of help, travels southward, and rejoins his slave master. The colonel rewards Grandison's loyalty by giving him a position with the house servants, and letting him tell his story of return to slavery. In this way, \\"freedom and happiness are associated with the South, not the North\\".Cutter 2010, p. 46. However, the last section of the final part reveals Grandison's true goal: the escape from slavery together with his new wife and family. The end reveals \\"Chesnutt's story for what it is: a story about an intelligent enslaved individual who desires and attains liberty not just for himself, but for the family he loves\\". Some interpreters of the story see Grandison as coordinating with rather than rejecting aid from Northern abolitionists. Grandison only tells Colonel Owens that he refused the offer of help from abolitionists, but Chesnutt never provides dialogue between Grandison and the abolitionist Boston clergyman and Canadians he is seen talking with. Grandison's feigned loyalty would therefore be a means to keep the Colonel's guard down while he organizes with the Underground Railroad and Northern abolitionists his entire family's escape, for \\"not only does the trickster Grandison escape, but through meticulous coordination while up north he arranges for the escape of his entire extended family\\".Koy 2010, p. 70. Chesnutt indicates this coordination with abolitionists: \\"The magnitude of the escaping party begot unusual vigilance on the part of those who sympathized with the fugitives, and, strangely enough, the underground railroad seemed to have had its tracks cleared and signals set for this particular train.\\" Chesnutt 2008, p. 178. =Destabilization of categorical thinking= Chesnutt's story addresses racism and the limitation of defining individuals according to fixed categories. Through an \\"openness and instability of the system of signs,\\" the short story suggests a destabilization of such categories that are used to define characterization according to race and racialization of an individual. \\"The Passing of Grandison\\" highlights that \\"binary categories and stereotypical ideologies ... limit our ability to see the complexity of any given racial or textual situation\\".Cutter 2010, p. 48. Martha J. Cutter suggests that one possible goal of Chesnutt in this story is to raise the reader's awareness \\"not just of the complexity of race itself, but of the ideologies that create racist ways of thinking\\". Chesnutt's story criticizes the institution of slavery. =References to other people= In this story, Chesnutt alludes to other texts and people connected to African- American history. He uses forms of African oral traditions of storytelling, such as \\"spoken language\\", \\"hyperbole\\", and \\"signifying\\".Montgomery 2010, p. 5. Grandison calls the colonel the \\"best marster any nigger ever had in dis worl; Cutter notes that this is similar to abolitionist Frederick Douglass's comment in his memoir, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845), in which he describes William Freeland as \\"the best master [he] ever had, till [he] became [his] own master\\".qtd. in Cutter 2010, p. 42. As the biography Frederick Douglass (1899) was published in the same year as The Wife of his Youth, Chesnutt very likely chose Grandison's words deliberately to allude to the full text of Douglass' phrase.Cutter 2010, p. 42. Cutter draws a connection between the choice of name for the enslaved hero of this story, as Charles Grandison Finney was a well-known Christian evangelist and abolitionist of the Antebellum period. Finney, an influential minister of the Jacksonian Era, is associated with a call for autonomy, equality and self-determination.

Additional work was carried out by USGS in 2005 including airborne surveys, hyperspectral surveys and analysis, and the compilation of prior data into a GIS database. The USGS reports that in the larger USGS defined Dusar- Shaida Area of Interest, there has been some mining. However, there is no known historic production from the Shaida licence area. The mine is estimated to contain five million tonnes of copper. Geology Shaida‚Äôs mineralisation has been described as a porphyry copper deposit. During the exploration continuous drilled intervals of mineralisation were identified, with copper grades between 0.10 to 0.80%, with drilled intervals ranging from 0.80 to 17.95m. Cross sections of drilling at the Shaida prospect show layered quartz plagioclase porphyry, quartz keratophyre and aleuropelites (siltstone or mudstone) interbedded with volcanic layers. Geography The Shaida Copper Mine is situated in the western region of Afghanistan in the Adraskan District of the Herat province, 65 km South-West of the city of Herat and 50 km SSW of Gozareh. It is anticipated that Gozareh will act as the logistics city for Herat Province. Herat Airport (which became an international airport in 2012) is close to Gozareh and there is also a railroad terminus station planned at Gozareh as part of the Afghanistan Railway Development Scheme. Ownership The deadline for submission of bids for the Shaida mineral tender was 6 August 2012. The Ministry of Mines of Afghanistan announced that on 26 November 2012, preferred bidder were selected to undertake the exploration and subsequent exploitation of Shaida Copper Mine. The selection of the preferred bidder for the mine follows an extensive process since launch in December 2011, which has been supported by transaction advisers and transparency advisers to the Ministry. The tender process for the Project is expected to culminate in the granting of an exploration license and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, will lead to the granting of the requisite exploitation license. Afghan Minerals Group (AMG) was chosen as the preferred bidder whilst Silk Road Mining & Development was chosen as the reserve bidder. AMG has four shareholders: * Supreme Group B.V. (67%) ‚Äì a major provider of logistics, supply chain and associated service solutions in the world‚Äôs most remote and challenging regions, with more than 8,500 employees worldwide and group turnover of US$6 billion in 2011. * UB Investments LLC, owned by the Khwaja family (11%) - represents multiple businesses including leading brands such as Black & Decker, Dewalt, D-Link, Ricoh, Sharp, Sony, Hyundai Automobiles and Fed Ex, owns production and storage facilities in Afghanistan and has more than 1,000 employees in Afghanistan. * Marco Polo Holdings Ltd, owned by the Gulzar family (11%) - holds distributorships of several brand names including Kraft, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Philip Morris, and Toyota in Afghanistan. He also invested in a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Afghanistan. * SAK Group FZCO, owned by Mr Haji ObaidullahSaderKhail (11%) - trades in basic food commodities and also fuel and transportation solutions. AMG's technical team includes Ken Haddow and David Cliff, both ex-Rio Tinto executives, and AMG have contracted Kazakhstan Minerals Company (KMC) to design and undertake their exploration and development programmes. KMC is an exploration contractor with operations throughout Russia and CIS states. KMC holds a strategic partnership with Iskander and together have a large number of drill rigs at their disposal. A consortium of six Indian companies, which includes four state-run companies (Hindustan Copper, Steel Authority of India Ltd, National Aluminium Co. and Mineral Exploration Corp) and two from private sector( Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd and Jindal Steel & Power Ltd), had bid for the Shaida project. SAIL led the consortium with 26 per cent stake followed by Hindustan Copper. This bid comes in after three of the four blocks of mining rights of Hajigak iron deposits, were awarded to AFISCO (Afghan Iron and Steel Consortium), a consortium led by the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) in November 2011. The Indian preference for the Shaida project appears to be due to its location and planned connectivity. The Indian consortium was looking at this rail link to move the mined copper ore to the Iranian port of Chabahar; bypassing its reliance on Pakistan. On 26 August 2012, Deputy Foreign Ministers of India, Afghanistan and Iran met ahead of NAM Summit in Tehran to discuss the utilization of Iran‚Äôs Chabahar port by the Indian consortium bidding for Shaida Copper mine. The under-construction rail link to Herat would pass some 12 kilometers from the Shaida copper mine.

There is evidence of mineral extraction activities at Balkhab going back almost 3,000 years, likely to have been continuous mining of copper via surface and underground workings. The copper mine is of Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit (VMS), modern exploration was conducted during 1966-1972, consisting of mapping, trench and surface grab sampling and analysis. Recent work on the Balkhab copper prospect was initiated by the Afghan Geological Survey, at the request of villagers in the region. A reconnaissance sampling mission was carried out in 2008 by the Ministry of Mines. The Balkhab copper deposit could be as high as 150 million tonnes. Road access to the site is from Mazar-i-Sharif, and the area has the potential to benefit from the proposed rail link connecting Afghanistan to Pakistan. The Chaman-Kandahar-Logar province line is proposed to pass just east of the project area with a station planned at near-by town Ghazni. The closest power source identified is at Mazar-i-Sharif which is connected to the North East Power System main isolated grid. The main water source for the project is the significant stream, Rode Balkhab, which splits the licence area. The Government of Afghanistan, through the Ministry of Mines, announced the opening of tender processes for the exploration and subsequent exploitation of the mine on 6 December 2011. The tender process for the Project is expected to culminate in the granting of a mining agreement with associated exploration licence(s) and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, will lead to the granting of the requisite exploitation licence(s). Canaccord Genuity, SRK Consulting and Mayer Brown are acting as transaction advisers to the Ministry in relation to the tenders for the Projects. The deadline for submission of bids for the Balkhab mineral tender was 23 July 2012. To ensure transparency and fair and open competition, bids for the mine were opened publicly by junior ministerial officers with bid- company representatives in attendance. The council‚Äôs evaluation of bids for Balkhab, were observed by transaction advisors and third party transparency advisers. On 26 November 2012, preferred bidders were selected to undertake the exploration and subsequent exploitation of the current mineral tenders. The selection of the preferred bidder for Balkhab follows an extensive process since launch in December 2011, An announcement of the winner for the mine was announce on 31 December 2012 with Preferred bidders and reserve bidders were selected for the mineral tender. The preferred bidder for the mine was investment group Centar and its operating company, Afghan Gold and Minerals Company (AGMC), and the reserve bidder was Silk Road Mining. The companies hoped to have a pilot plant operational by the end of 2014 or 2015. On October 5, 2018 in Washington, D.C., Afghan officials signed a 30 year contract involving $56 million investment by Centar and AGMC for exploration of an area covering 500 square km, with development of mining due to begin thereafter.

There are many processes that occur in the body which produce electrical signals that can be detected. Depending on the location and the source of these signals, distinct methods and techniques have been developed to properly target them.  Role of electrophysiology in clinical medicine  Electrophysiology has a very important role in ensuring accurate clinical diagnoses. Many neurological diseases cause symptoms that manifest far from the injured or deceased tissues. Locating and treating all affected areas of the body is essential for proper patient care. Electrophysiology allows for the investigation of abnormal electrical signals in the body‚Äôs tissues. It provides quantitative data to clinicians, supporting diagnostic processes and evaluating treatment success. Often, biological measures such as electrophysiology are more useful in assessing symptom severity than existing clinical measurement scales. Their objective nature removes subjective assignment of scores to symptom severity, subsequently leading to better informed healthcare decisions.  Electrophysiological techniques  There are various techniques available to study and measure the electromagnetic signals of the body.Arciniegas, David B, C Alan Anderson, and Donald C Rojas, Electrophysiological Techniques. Methods in physiological psychology III. Academic Press, 1978. 385-404. The brain, the heart and skeletal muscles are prime sources of electric and magnetic fields that can be recorded and the resulting patterns can give insight on what ailments the subject may have. These electrophysiological techniques are named according to what data is measured and sometimes the anatomical location of the sources as follows: = Electroencephalography (EEG) = Electroencephalography is the measurement of brain activity through the surface of the scalp.L. Jasmin \\"EEG\\" Electroencephalography data can be processed through analytical procedures and certain derived summary indices of these analyses are called quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Data from evoked potentials can also be used processed in certain ways that can be considered quantitative EEG as well. If QEEG data is mapped then it is a topographic QEEG (also known as brain electrical activity mapping or BEAM ) = Electrocardiography (EKG) = The heart is the muscle that pumps oxygenated blood to the whole body. As a very active muscle, it has peculiar electrical activity that can be measured and analyzed. Electrocardiography is the measurement of these signals. = Electromyography (EMG) = Electromyography is the measurement and analysis of the electrical activity in skeletal muscles. This technique is useful for diagnosing the health of the muscle tissue and the nerves that control them.Mayo Clinic Staff, \\"Electromyography (EMG)\\". Retrieved 27 July 2012 EMG measures action potentials, called Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs), created during muscle contraction. A few common uses are determining whether a muscle is active or inactive during movement (onset of activity), assessing the velocity of nerve conduction, and the amount of force generated during movement. Of these uses, determining the onset of muscle activity has been shown to be the most accurate.Kamen, G. & Gabriel, D. A. (2010). Essentials of Electromyography. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics. = Event-related potentials (ERPs) = The firing of neurons throughout the brain has been known to have localized relationships to certain functions, processes and reactions to stimuli. With proper equipment it is possible to locate where in the brain neurons have been activated and measure their event related potentials. Event- related potentials can be classified as either: sensory, motor or cognitive.Bressler, S. L. and Ding, M. 2006. \\"Event-Related Potentials\\". Wiley Encyclopedia of Biomedical Engineering. = Evoked Potentials (EPs) = Measurement of spontaneous electrophysiological activity does not always provide the desired information from the signals of interest. In such cases, the application of a stimulus to the desired target can produce transient evoked potentials that can provide further insight not obtained from solely passive recording methods such as EEG, ECG, EMG or MEG. = Magnetoencephalography (MEG) = The measurement of the naturally occurring magnetic fields produced by the brain's electrical activity is called magnetoencephalography. This method differs from magnetic resonance imaging in that it passively measures the magnetic fields without altering the body's magnetization. However, data from MEG and MRI can be combined to create images that approximately map the estimated location of the natural magnetic fields. This composite imaging process is called magnetic source imaging (MSI). = Nerve conduction study (NCS) = An NCS measures the electrical conduction velocity and other characteristics of nerves in the body.  Diagnosable conditions and applicable methods  The toolset of available electrophysiological techniques has been carefully applied to the study of patients suffering from a wide variety of conditions in the hopes of finding novel and more reliable diagnosis. For some conditions the use of these methods in their diagnosis is standard, but for others their applicability for diagnosis is still in the research phase. Some conditions where the usefulness of electrophysiological techniques has been determined or being studied with promising results follow: = Brainstem lesions in traumatic brain injury = In the event of a traumatic brain injury the presence of a brainstem lesion has a significant impact in the prognosis of the patient. Although the development of MRI has allowed for very effective detection of brainstem lesions, evoked potentials measurements are also an electrophysiological technique that has been used for over 30 years in this context. = Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) = The compression of the median nerve within the carpal canal of the wrist and the progression of symptoms resulting from this entrapment is known as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Nerve conduction studies have been used as a control electrophysiological method in the development of better CTS diagnostic techniques. = Dementia = Dementia is a progressive, degenerative brain disease that impairs cognitive functions.Ifeachor, E. C., et al, \\"Biopattern Analysis and Subject-Specific Diagnosis and Care of Dementia \\"., Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference, September 2005 Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and other types of dementia diagnosis is being improved through the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials(ERP). = Epilepsy = Abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain can cause seizures. These symptoms are characteristic of the neurological disorder known as epilepsy. Epilepsy is typically diagnosed with an EEG test.A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia., \\"Epilepsy - PubMed Health\\". Retrieved 27 July 2012 However, the effectiveness of MEG in the diagnosis of neocortical epilepsy has also been established.H. Stefan, \\"The Role of MEG in Epilepsy Diagnosis and Treatment\\", ACNR, Volume 4, No 2, May/June 2004 = Essential tremor = It is hard to diagnose essential tremor and differentiate it from other types of tremor. The burst discharge patterns of EMG signals is compared to the frequency and amplitude of videotaped tremors to evaluate and diagnose essential tremor. = Heart disease = Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Diagnosis of heart disease can require various non-electrophysiological methods since there are many possible ailments, but EKG can be used to detect some. = Spasticity (cerebral palsy and stroke) = Spasticity is a velocity dependent resistance to stretch due to increases in gamma motor neuron activity Lance, J.W., The control of muscle tone, reflexes, and movement: Robert Wartenberg Lecture, Neurology, 30 (1980) 1303- 1313. The most commonly affected muscles are those that oppose gravity, the elbow and wrist flexors, knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors. Spasticity is a side effect of multiple central nervous system disorders including Cerebral Palsy, Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis and spinal cord injuries and results in limited joint range of motion of the affected limb. Stroke is currently the leading cause of death in the United States. Ischemic stroke is the most common form, accounting for 85% of all stroke cases. It involves restricted blood flow to areas of the brain, resulting from a blood clot or ruptured vessel, and ultimately causes brain tissue damage. Spasticity is a common side effect of this brain tissue damage and affects the lives of many stroke survivors. The increased muscle tone of spastic muscles encumbers goal- directed movements; impairing activities of daily living while additionally causing pain and discomfort. Valid, reliable, and sensitive measures of spasticity are necessary to accurately diagnose patients suffering from this neurophysiological condition and assess the effectiveness of various treatment modalities. Electromyography (EMG) has been proposed by multiple researchers as an alternative measurement technique to quantify spasticity. EMG is used to determine the onset of muscle activity in spastic muscles, allowing for comparison between affected patients and asymptomatic individuals. Measurement tools involving EMG are argued to be more sensitive than currently used clinical scales like the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in detecting spasticity symptom severity. The use of EMG offers a quantitative value of severity as opposed to relying on subjective scoring protocols. Malhotra et al. (2008) used EMG and the MAS to determine which method was more effective in detecting spasticity of the wrist flexors. In their sample of 100 patients (median age 74 years), they found that using EMG to detect onset of muscle activity during multiple passive stretch repetitions of the wrist at various velocities, successfully detected spasticity in 87 patients while the MAS only detected spasticity in 44 of these individuals. These findings support the use of EMG as a more sensitive diagnostic tool than the MAS and therefore advantageous when used in a clinical setting. Similarly, EMG was successful in detecting elbow flexor spasticity symptom improvement in six post-stroke subjects (mean age 54.16 ¬± 7.9 years) following a neural mobilization technique of the median nerve. At 90 degrees of flexion and full extension of the elbow, muscle activity decreased from 17% pre-treatment to 11% post-treatment. These patients had initial MAS scores of 1 or 2, and the MAS was incapable of detecting the same symptom improvements post-treatment as seen with the EMG method. Cerebral palsy is another group of disorders caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain, which may result in spasticity.https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/index/html EMG has also been successfully used to quantify spasticity in this patient population. Using surface EMG and a torque motor, Levin et al. (1994, 2000) demonstrated a direct relationship between the velocity of stretch and the onset of spasticity. They incorporated EMG in their use of a novel motorized manipulandum due to its ability to detect stretch reflex activity and thus incorporate the velocity-dependent nature of spasticity in the resulting diagnostic values. = Multiple sclerosis = The demyelination and scarring of axons in the neurons of the nervous system can affect their conduction properties and seriously harm the normal communication of the brain with the rest of the body. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that causes this deterioration of the myelin sheath. There isn't a unique test to diagnose MS and several studies must be combined to determine the presence of this disease. However, visual evoked potentials do play a role in the whole diagnostic process. = Parkinson's disease = Parkinson's disease is a degenerative ailment that affects the central nervous system and is typically identified initially by its motor related symptoms. Accurate differentiation of PD from any other neurological disorder and the identification of the disease course is important in establishing an appropriate antiparkinsonian therapy. In the diagnostic role, surface EMG is a very informative method used to obtain relevant quantitative characteristics.

College  A four-year letterwinner and three- year starter for the Bulldogs, Archbold led Butler in scoring for three consecutive seasons and sits in fourth place on Butler's all-time scoring list with 1,744 career points. He set a Butler single season scoring record with 770 points in 1991-92, and he continues to hold Butler's all-time record for three-point field goal shooting (.465). Archbold was a two-time all-conference selection and a two-time Butler MVP. Notably, in 1991, Archbold became Butler's first men's basketball player named Horizon League (formerly Midwestern Collegiate Conference) Player of the Year. That season, he led the NCAA Division I in free throw shooting (.912) and finished second in the conference in scoring (21.8 ppg). On March 16, 1992 he was also featured as the Player of the Week by Sports Illustrated. He was named to Butler's All- Century Team in 1998 and to Butler's Team of the Sesquicentennial in 2006. Archbold was added to Butler's Hall of Fame in 2008. Archbold is a notable figure in the Butler-Xavier basketball rivalry, as Xavier's Maurice Brantley punched Archbold while in the postgame handshake line. The Chicago Tribune reported: \\"Brantley\`s open right hand slapped the side of Archbold\`s head, which snapped back. The Butler guard, who had been frustrated and punished throughout the game, pushed back, and with that Brantley unloaded a right that bloodied Archbold\`s chin.\\" In spite of both players subsequently being placed on probation by the conference, Archbold was named the conference's player of the year. The following season, Archbold had his revenge when he scored 42 points, leading Butler to a 96‚Äì86 victory at Xavier's home arena at that time, the Cincinnati Gardens. The Bulldogs also beat Xavier six days later in the semifinals of the MCC Tournament at Cincinnati's Riverfront Coliseum.

History After the Java War, the Dutch colonial government commissioned Ajibarang R. Ranusentika to clear the forest on the slopes. He often went fishing in a waterfall, under which there is a niche or a deep pool. During one of those fishing sessions, Ranusentika felt the tip of the hook pulled by a fish that was big, but when the end of the hook is retrieved there was no big fish, but a pendok, or yellow gold dagger sheath, that caught the eye of the hook.

Amnesty International has named him to be a prisoner of conscience three times.  Background  Gomez Manzano was born in Havana, Cuba. At the age of eleven, he was sent by his parents to study in the Appalachian Mountains region of the U.S. He then earned a scholarship to Moscow's Patrice Lumumba University, where he studied International Law. As a result of his travels, he is fluent in Spanish, Russian, English, and French. He is a Roman Catholic and an avid chess player. A defense lawyer, he entered the dissident movement when he began to defend political prisoners in the late 1980s. He became a cofounder of Corriente Agramontista in 1990, an organization of lawyers willing to file suit against the state to force it to fulfill its own laws. On 6 August 1994, he was arrested and detained in what Amnesty International called \\"an apparent round- up of known government critics and human rights activists\\"; the group designated him a prisoner of conscience. For several years, Gomez Manzano was married to fellow dissident and independent journalist Ana Margarita Perdig√≥n Brito until she decided to leave Cuba with her daughter and seek exile in the United States in 2012.  ‚ÄòThe Group of Four‚Äô  In 1997, Gomez Manzano, Marta Beatriz Roque, Vladimiro Roca, and Felix Bonne founded the Internal Dissidence Working Group. They then published a paper titled \\"The Homeland Belongs to All,\\" which discussed Cuba's human rights situation and called for political and economic reforms. They also called for a boycott of elections in Cuba's one-party system and for investors to avoid Cuba, giving several news conferences to discuss their concerns. Gomez Manzano and the other members of the group were arrested on 16 July 1997. The four were detained for 19 months and then tried for sedition in March 1999 in a one-day trial closed to the foreign press. Gomez Manzano was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. The defendants became known as the \\"Group of Four\\". The United States, Canada, the European Union and the Vatican all called for his release. Amnesty International again declared the four prisoners of conscience, \\"detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association\\", and called for their immediate release. Gomez Manzano was released early without explanation on 24 May 2000, having served just under three years in prison. Other members of the Group of Four were released around the same time. In November 2000, the four published another essay, titled \\"Social Facets\\", as President Fidel Castro attended a summit in Panama. The essay stated that Cuban education was designed to indoctrinate children, that many children were malnourished from food shortages, and that foreigners in Cuba were allowed privileges--such as cars, computers, and cell phones--that ordinary Cuban people were not.  Later activism  Gomez Manzano was critical of fellow dissident Oswaldo Pay√°'s Varela Project, in which Pay√° presented the National Assembly of People's Power (NAPP) with 25,000 signatures in an attempt to force a constitutional referendum. Gomez Manzano stated that appeals to the NAPP were useless as long as it was dominated by the Communist Party. In July 2005, Gomez Manzano was arrested while leaving his home, allegedly to join a protest at the French Embassy with Marta Beatriz Roque's Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba. He was detained without charge for eighteen months, during which time he later stated that he undertook two hunger strikes. Amnesty International again designated him a prisoner of conscience and lobbied for his release. He was released on 9 February 2007. Having been banned from practicing law, he stated that he relied on aid from \\"compatriots in exile\\". He told reporters that he nonetheless intended to remain in Cuba and continue his activism, stating, \\"Change will come sooner than later\\". In an April 2009 cable released by WikiLeaks in December 2010, Jonathan D. Farrar, head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, described Gomez Manzano, Oswaldo Paya, and other dissidents as \\"hopelessly out of touch\\", writing, \\"They have little contact with younger Cubans and, to the extent they have a message that is getting out, it does not appeal to that segment of society.\\"  Awards and Distinctions  In 1997, the American Bar Association awarded him its International Human Rights Award, but Gomez Manzano was unable to travel to receive it due to his detention. In 1999, G√≥mez Manzano, along with his co-authors Roque, Roca and Bonne, were awarded the Grand Prize for Press Freedom by the Inter-American Press Association for the publication of \\"The Homeland Belongs to All.\\"Tania Quintero: Agradece Vladimiro Roca gestiones por su libertad (Spanish), IAPA, 2000, retrieved on 2014-04-08 In 2007, an international jury of various bar associations awarded him the Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize for lawyers, the presentation of which he was again prevented from attending.Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize 2007, official website, retrieved 8 April 2014.

Matthias invaded with the pretext of returning Bohemia to Catholicism; at the time, it was ruled by the Hussite king, George of Podƒõbrad. Matthias' invasion was largely successful, leading to his acquisition of the southern and eastern parts of the country. Its core lands however, centered on Prague, were never taken. Ultimately both Matthias and Podƒõbrad would proclaim themselves king, though neither ever acquired all the necessary subordinate titles. When Podƒõbrad died in 1471, his successor Vladislaus II continued the fight against Matthias. In 1478, the war ended following the treaties of Brno and the Olomouc. Upon Matthias' death in 1490, Vladislaus would succeed him as king of both Hungary and Bohemia. Background At the beginning of his reign, Matthias continued the policy of his father John Hunyadi in defending Hungary, the \\"bulwark of Christendom,\\" against the Turks. However, as Matthias led campaigns each year, he came to the realization that by the late 15th century it was no longer possible to oust the Ottoman Turks from Europe. Rankling under the heavy costs of bordering the Sultan, and resenting his Christian neighbors, like Frederick III, who often meddled in Hungary when Matthias was on campaign, Matthias made the radical decision to come to an entente with the Turks, enabling the Hungarian king to turn westward. The war In 1468, Matthias began a war in Bohemia on the pretext of restoring that land to the Papacy. Podƒõbrad, the Bohemian king who had once protected Matthias, had made himself too tempting a target when he made enemies out of two Popes and became alienated from most of his Catholic neighbors. Matthias seized Moravia and Silesia from Podƒõbrad and proclaimed himself the Czech king; yet Matthias was never able to seize Prague from the Hussites. The war would continue with Podƒõbrad's successor Vladislaus, until the latter signed the Treaty of Brno with Matthias in 1478, recognizing the Hungarian king's conquests. The Peace of Olomouc would confirm the Treaty of Brno. With Matthias' death in 1490, Vladislaus would succeed Matthias as king of both Hungary and Bohemia. References * Tanner, Marcus.

It represented workers employed in the preparation of leather from hides, and the manufacture of a variety of leather and canvas goods. Establishment The beginnings of the ALATEF can be traced back to the founding of two organisations, the Australian Saddlery Trades Employees Federation and the Federated Tanners, Curriers and Leather Dressers Employees' Union of Australia. These unions merged in 1918 to form the Australian Saddlery and Leather Workers' Trades Employees' Federation. Following several name changes, including the convoluted \\"Australian Saddlery, Leather, Sail, Canvas, Tanning, Leather Dressing and Allied Workers' Trades Employees' Federation\\", the union settled on its final name in 1945.  Amalgamation  The decline of the leather industry in Australia, as well as increased mechanisation, led to a reduced membership, and the union began seeking amalgamation with other unions. Despite approaching several unions in the textile and apparel industries, the union's reputation for militancy and its communist political leanings meant its advances were rebuffed. The union eventually reached an agreement in 1967 to amalgamate with the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union, FMWU, and ceased to exist in 1970. The successor to the FMWU, United Voice, continues to provide coverage for leather workers.

When Duke Skule had founded Rein abbey he intended that Austr√•tt should go to his sister, who had inherited and added to the monastic estate. However, consistent with the practice of the time, the land was property of the crown, so after a lengthy legal process in 1238 Austr√•tt was awarded instead to √Ösulv, in return for which he compensated the abbey with other lands. This led to a bitter enmity between the two men, which, when combined with Duke Skule's rivalry for kingship of Norway, played an important role the last phase of the civil war. In 1239 Skule led a revolt against his son-in-law, King Haakon Haakonsson, and, after losing the Battle of Oslo in 1240, sought refuge in Elgeseter Priory in Nidaros. √Ösulv and his Birkebeiners set fire to the monastery, and then killed Skule and his entourage when they tried to save themselves. With Skule‚Äôs death, the civil war era came to an end.H√•kon H√•konsson 1217-1263 (University of Oslo) Since killing men who had sought refuge in a priory was considered a sacrilege, √Ösulv was required to do penance by going on pilgrimages.

A popular feature of the show is the sideshows which feature showrides, foodstalls, games of skill, and showbag stalls. The show runs for three days, Friday through to Sunday, ending on the second Saturday in October. The Friday is a public holiday in the City of Ballarat, Hepburn Shire and selected regions in the Golden Plains Shire, known as Show Day. The Saturday is known as family day and usually involves many discounts and savings on showbags and rides from the other days. Like its southern counterpart, the Royal Melbourne Show, over recent years the event has shifted towards more of a carnival atmosphere than its previously more agrarian focus.

Brookes. New models of family support services were initiated, including professional models which involved both traditional respite for the families (i.e., opportunity for a break from the stress of caring for children with \\"special needs\\") and individual recreation opportunities in generic agencies/sites for the son or daughter (versus traditional in-home babysittingchild care).e.g., Racino, J. (1985a). Respite program models ‚Äî Use of generic services and family subsidy. In: J. Racino, Respite services in New York State. (pp. 27-30). Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Maxwell School of International and Public Affairs. Professional parents sought to have respite places available in group homes (e.g., friend of the home), to develop small group respite settings, to hold parent-to-parent support groups and meetings, to establish councils, and to have cash subsidies to meet the extra expenses of raising a \\"disabled child\\" (e.g., Exceptional Family Resources, Syracuse, New York, 1985).

Basis in theories Family support is based in part on theories related to families, particularly family systems theory, ecological and support theories, community support theories, life-span and life course theories, family psycho-social theories, family empowerment theory, the work-home resources model, and positivistic theories, such as the sociology of acceptance.Bogdan, R. & Taylor, S.

It differs from other models of family support developed in the context of employment programs, housing programs, nutrition, transportation, health care, or city emergency programs. These included: the Family Support Services of West Hawaii (including community and economic development activities), Family Support ServicesFamily Support Services of Amarillo (including employee assistance and family therapy), Family Support Services of Southeastern Pennsylvania (e.g., child welfare and early intervention), City of Chicago Family and Support Services (e.g., domestic violence, senior services).(brief web review, 2011). Growth in the US By the 1990s, family support had gained in great popularity in the field of intellectual disabilities, especially since 80-90% of children with disabilities continue to live with their families even today.e.g., Fujuira, G. & Braddock, D. 1999. Fiscal and demographic trends in mental retardation services: The emergence of the family. In: L. Rowitz (Ed.), Mental retardation in the year 2000. New York: Springer-Verlag. (Cited in: Stancliffe, R. & Lakin, K.C. (2005). Costs and outcomes of community services for people with intellectual disabilities. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.) Yet, the Human Services Research Institute determined that only 1.5% of the state budgets for developmental disabilities services was used to support these families as at 1990.Knoll, J., Covert, S., O'Connor, S., Agosta, J., & Blaney, B. (1990). Family support services in the US: An end of decade status report. Cambridge, MA: Human Services Research Institute. By 2006, family support spending was reported to be $2,305,149,428 in the US,Braddock, D., Hemp, R., & Rizzolo, M. (2008). The state of the states in developmental disabilities. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. yet, in FY 2006, it remained at only 5% of total intellectual and developmental disabilities spending of $43.84 billion. In the US, the costs of \\"family care\\" in intellectual and developmental disabilities have been studied, including direct financial costs met by families, indirect and opportunity costs, and indirect psychological costs.Lewis, D. & Johnson, D. (2005). Costs of family care for individuals with developmental disabilities. In: R.J. Stancliffe & K.C. Lakin, \\"Costs and outcomes of community services for people with intellectual disabilities\\". (pp.63-89). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. In related fields, though, family support is still often considered to be \\"unpaid\\", \\"voluntary support\\" by family members, family-to-family training programs, self-help groups, often near forms of family interventions by professionals (e.g., behavioral training, clinical assessments, vocational training, family therapy, clinical community re-entry) in traumatic brain injury.Williams, J. & Kay, T. (1991). \\"Head injury: A family matter\\". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. and in adult mental health.LeGacy, S. (1978). \\"Training for parents of adults with mental illness: Series of sessions\\". Syracuse, NY: Transitional Living Services of Onondaga County, New York State, USA. In children's mental health, family support and advocacy organizations are viewed to be increasing at the systems and policy levels, with the late 1980s formation of the Federation of Families for Children's Mental HealthKoroloff, N., Friesen, B., Reilley, L., & Rinkin, J.

Family support services today are viewed as important for families with individuals with diverse disabilities (e.g., motor-neuron disease, AIDS, epilepsy cerebral palsy, autism)with a greater emphasis on choice in support services (e.g., counseling, training and information, respite). =As a parent-professional field= As family support would be considered a parent-professional field, the research studies documented diverse disabilities (e.g., epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, hearing/visual impairment, spina bifida, cancer, learning disability), household incomes, level of assistance by daily living activities, behavioral and medical needs, insurance coverage, daily routines, impact of disability on the household, services for specialized needs, and so forth.e.g., Knoll, J.

Brookes. two major national and international comprehensive reform efforts in community living. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. In addition, governmental policy today appears to continue to encourage adults with disabilities to live at home with parents or caregivers (2011); thus, family support funds are usually designated for families with children and adults living at home, including in families with aging parents. However, family supports are also integral to adoptive and foster families and may take the form of in-home aides or home assistance, provision of equipment, respite and home adaptations, and shared care options between birth and foster parents/families.Walker, P.

Family support and aging, a major concern in 2000s due to the aging population in the US, was also the focus of service reform in the 1990s. For example, 700,000 people with developmental disabilities live with one or more parent over the age of 65.The Arc and the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. (2008). \\"Family support\\".

In states like New York and Connecticut, this resulted in tension between \\"institutional\\" and \\"community parents\\" vying for limited public funds, and between providers of services for funding (e.g., state institutions and private, non-profit community sectors). However, as states began to close institutions, funding was often available primarily to relocate those individuals living in institutional care or those at risk of institutionalization (e.g., home and community-based Medicaid waiver, HCBS).Research and Training Center on Community Integration.

For example, \\"15 states financed 90% or more of their family support services with Medicaid HCBS; 11 states financed their family support activities through state funding. Since family supports were recommended for children, options such as foster care (new models for adults and children)often included family support services, families on waiting lists were offered family support services, and a broader range of types of services were developed in different states (e.g., Wisconsin's menu of services).Racino, J.

New and traditional population groups In the 2000s, \\"new population groups\\" in family support, as part of family support theories in the US and worldwide, included: * multicultural and transnational families, * families which include a member who is gay, lesbian, transsexual or bisexual, * youth with disabilities, * aging population in the US, * youth in mental health, * families with a member with a brain injury, and * parents with intellectual and other disabilities, among others. =Adolescent mothers and single parent families= Traditional groups known to be at-risk of adolescent mothers were sometimes involved in social support and adolescent theories, as part of adolescent pregnancies and mothering research. At-risk families in intellectual disabilities also may be single mothers and early recommendations were for additional support options such as boarding nearby to family, modifying apartment programs to allow children, and increasing family support services in private homes. Critical are personal and family values, empowerment of families and home visitors, parent-child activities, and cluster groups (e.g., neighborhood improvement, natural child birth groups, toddler play groups, team group support), among others (e.g., Cochran, et al., 1984).Cochran, M., Dean, C., Dill, M.F., & Woolever, F. (1984). Empowering Families: Home Visiting and Building Clusters. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, Family Matters Project. =Multicultural and transnational families= In addition, the needs of multicultural families, based on changing US demographics, also resulted in greater attention to the major minority groups, including African-Americans, Asian Americans, native Indian Americans, and Hispanic/Latino Americans.McCallion, P. & Grant-Griffin, L.

(1995). \\"Return to the community: Building Support Services for People with Psychiatric Disabilities\\". NY, NY: The Guilford Press. In addition, community agencies often have developed parent education programs (which remains as a government-funded program in the US), and family therapists and counselors (often in private practice) tend to work with the whole family. Personal assistance and independent living approaches tend to begin with the desires and wishes of the youth or adult, and less often, the children; these approaches in mental health still remain relatively uncommon though psychosocial approaches have some similarity.Racino, J. (1999). Psychiatric survivors, the international self help movement, and personal assistance services. \\"Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All\\". London: Haworth Press. While housing and support and employment supports have been transferred across fields, greater reluctance exists in the field of mental health for \\"family support\\" (often starting with parental concerns) who often bill the parents as secondary service recipients. In psychiatric rehabilitation, \\"families are a major resource impacting rehabilitation outcome\\" (families as allies) with 50-60% returning home from hospitals in US (Anthony, et al., 2002, p. 185). Extended families are viewed as critical worldwide, and many approaches are categorized as \\"family management\\" (e.g., information, treatments, family management), family interventions or \\"psychoeducational\\" (Ibid, 2002).Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M. & Gagne, C. (2002). \\"Psychiatric Rehabilitation\\". Boston, MA: Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Boston University. However, leading national research centers in the US examined state service systems and recommended prevention and family support for children in mental health and their families.Friedman, R. M. (1994). Restructuring of systems to emphasize prevention and family support. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, Volume 23 (Suppl.): 40-47. Such \\"ecologically-grounded models\\" which are expected to improve or \\"mediate child and parent outcomes\\" have often been the first targeted in difficult economic times; the \\"full fledged family support movement\\" of community-based agencies was reported in 1992 as \\"struggling to operationalize a new set of services and a new way of doing business with families\\".Weiss, H.B. & Greene, J.

Common may be a referral to a support group for the spouse or caregiver who may experience \\"caregiver stress\\" and \\"burden of care\\", the result of inadequate community services in homes and for families. In addition, brain or head injuries can be caused by vehicular accidents, sports injuries, falls or accidents, war and terrorism, and related medical conditions (e.g., brain tumor, stroke). Family support in these fields often refers to support groups or direct support from the family and neighbors to the individual with the brain injury, or the rehabilitation or hospital program as the family support.Williams, J. & Kay, T.

(pp. 217-256). Washington, DC: The Arc and the American Association on Mental Retardation. The overarching goal was: To support the caregiving efforts and enhance the quality of life of all families so that families will remain the core unit of American society. The five subgoals include: *Goal A: To ensure family-professional partnerships in research, policy-making, and the planning and delivery of supports and services so that families control their own destinies with due regard to the autonomy of adult family members with disabilities to control their own lives. *Goal B: To ensure that families fully participate in communities of their choice through comprehensive, inclusive, neighborhood-based, and culturally responsive supports and services. *Goal C: To ensure that services and supports for all families are available, accessible, appropriate, affordable and accountable. *Goal D: To ensure that sufficient public and private funding will be available to implement these goals and that all families will participate in directing the use of public funds authorized and appropriated for their benefits. *Goal E: To ensure that families and professionals have full access to state-of-the-art knowledge and best practices and that they will collaborate in using knowledge and practices. (p. 221). Such efforts are critical as the US has often been criticized for having a lack of a coherent family policy for all its people (e.g., health care, housing, employment, leisure, community and economic development).Racino, J.

He was the Governor of West Kalimantan from 1960 to 1966; he was the first ethnic Dayak to hold the position. Oevaang Oeray was a founder of the Dayak Unity Party, which participated in the Indonesian elections of 1955.Bangkit Runtuhnya Partai Persatuan Dayak. Harian Equator. Accessed on 14 July 2012 He was a staunch supporter of freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. Biography Oevaang Oeray was born in Kedamin, Kapuas Hulu, on 18 August 1922. He was the youngest child born to Ledjo and Hurei, Dayak farmers and rubber workers. In 1959 Oevang was selected as the Governor of West Kalimantan by the provincial legislative board. This was confirmed by President Sukarno with Presidential Decree 465/1959, dated 24 December 1959. Oevang's term was to last from 1 January 1960 until 12 July 1966. The success of his Dayak Unity Party, which received 146,054 votes during the 1955 legislative election, led to non-Dayaks accusing him of nepotism, selecting only ethnic Dayaks for government employment and thus dividing the province on ethnic lines. In 1964 General Supardjo, the commander of the IV Mandala Siaga Fighting Squad, took complete military control of the province. He left the area in 1965 after receiving a letter from his wife and was replaced by A.J. Winoto, who fought against guerrillas along the Sarawak border. Oevaang Oeray lent Winoto political support. As Oevaang Oeray was close to President Sukarno/Soekarnois, after the 30 September Movement killed six generals in Jakarta Oevaang Oeray was accused of being involved with the Indonesian Communist Party.Aju. JC Oevaang Oeray, Mengorbankan sang Pencetus Pancasila Sinar-Harapan. 31 May 2011. Accessed on 15 July 2012. Archived from the original Although Oevaang Oeray was a leftist, he was not a supporter of the Communist Party. Many other ethnic Dayaks were accused of being communist sympathisers during this time. On 12 July 1966 Internal Minister Basuki Rahmat dismissed Oevaang Oeray, replacing him with Lieutenant Colonel Soemadi.Pergantian Gubernur , J.C Oevang Oeray ‚Äì Soemadi ‚Äì Kadarusno Borneo Tribun. 2 February 2011.

Retrieved 10 Apr 2014.() or Leipzig Basin http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335462/Leipzig or Saxon LowlandDickinson (1964), p. 37. or Saxon Bay is a relatively lakeless and highly fertile landscape in Central Germany, in northwestern Saxony and southeastern Saxony-Anhalt. This region was originally covered with lakes, dense forests and rivers. In the course of urbanization and lignite open pit mining, large areas were deforested and many rivers and streams canalised or diverted. The Leipzig Bay is bounded to the north by the D√ºben Heath, to the east by the River Elbe, to the south by the Ore Mountain Foreland and the Central Saxon Hills, and by the River Saale to the west. The conurbation formed by the two cities of Leipzig and Halle lies in the centre of the Leipzig Bay. Other important towns are Delitzsch, Eilenburg, Merseburg and Borna.  Geology  The Leipzig Bay is a Young Drift landscape and the southernmost part of the North German Plain. The landscape is essentially a plain broken only by low eminences such as the Hohburg Hills and dissected by the valleys of the Saale, White Elster, Mulde, and Plei√üe rivers. The Leipzig Bay was formed during the Tertiary period. When the Ore Mountains and Vogtland were uplifted, a basin was formed as a compensating movement, into which weathering material from the mountain ranges was deposited. As a result of the creation of bogs and variable flooding, organic material was also deposited in this basin, which in turn was overlaid by sediments. Brown coal or lignite was formed from these deposits, which is covered by layers of sand and loess.Geologische √úbersichtskarte 1 : 200,000, Sheet CC 4734 Leipzig. Bundesanstalt f√ºr Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe  Location  The landscape is very well served by communications. A cardioid ring motorway runs around the Leipzig-Halle conurbation, the so-called Central German Loop (Mitteldeutsche Schleife). Leipzig/Halle Airport is an important transport hub in the eastern German states. Railway lines and Bundesstra√üen (federal roads) run in all directions of the compass, linking the Leipzig Bay with other parts of the country. Only inland shipping has no direct access to this region, although work on the unfinished Elster-Saale Canal began in the mid 20th century.  Importance  The Leipzig region is historically, culturally and economically of huge importance to Central Germany. Although open-cast mining continues in the area, it is also being developed from an environmental and tourist perspective, through the reclamation of old lignite pits and mining facilities and their conversion into recreation areas, especially north and south of Leipzig. By flooding some the open-cast mines many new lakes have been and are being created in the Leipzig Basin, which are gradually changing the face of the landscape.

It was published in 1929, shortly after Coolidge left office. Coolidge's autobiography consisted of about 45,000 words, unusually short in comparison to the era's typical \\"long-winded\\" biographies and autobiographies. It was praised by Ray Long (editor of Cosmopolitan magazine) for describing the complete story of Coolidge's life and \\"the complete story of our country during the dramatic years of this generation.\\" Coolidge was one of the first U.S. Presidents to write and publish an autobiography. Coolidge's autobiography covers all the notable moments in his life, such as his childhood and youth, Governorship, Presidency, son's death, and retirement. It was criticized by some for being too obvious and not presenting any new information that was previously unknown to the public. However, this trait of the autobiography was not that surprising as no one expected Coolidge to reveal some private government information and secrets in his autobiography (Coolidge was a very private man, despite his happy-going and cheerful public personality image). However, it was also complimented for its succinctness and relative shortness, considering that most autobiographies of the time were much longer. Coolidge's autobiography, in contrast, was about half the size of a novel. One of the most notable moments in the book was Coolidge's belief that President Warren Harding would recover (in 1923) and then his surprise and inauguration following Harding's death. The Coolidge autobiography was extremely popular at the time of its publication, as evidenced by the large amount of fan mail that its author received and by the willingness of many newspapers to publish parts of the autobiography so that much more of the American public could buy it and view it. Coolidge said that he hoped that his autobiography might guide and encourage the young men and women of America.

Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court decision in which the court found that the Alien Tort Claims Act presumptively does not apply extraterritorially.. Background The plaintiffs in Kiobel were citizens of Nigeria who claimed that Dutch, British, and Nigerian oil-exploration corporations aided and abetted the Nigerian government in the 1990s to commit violations of customary international law.Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 621 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2010). The plaintiffs claimed that Royal Dutch Shell compelled Shell Nigeria its Nigerian subsidiary, in cooperation with the Nigerian government, in a brutal crushing of peaceful resistance to aggressive oil development in the Ogoni Niger River Delta. Plaintiffs sought damages under the ATS. The defendants moved to dismiss based on a two-pronged argument. Firstly, they argued that customary international law itself provides the rules to decide whether conduct violates the law of nations where non-state actors are alleged to have committed the wrong in question. Second, they contended that no norm has ever existed between nations that imposes liability upon corporate actors. On September 29, 2006, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims for aiding and abetting property destruction; forced exile; extrajudicial killing; and violation of the rights to life, liberty, security, and association. It reasoned that customary international law did not define the violations with sufficient particularity. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining claims of aiding and abetting arbitrary arrest and detention; crimes against humanity; and torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. The district court then certified its entire order for interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit based on the serious nature of the questions at issue. In a 2‚Äì1 decision issued on September 17, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that corporations cannot be held liable for violations of customary international law: *Under both U.S. Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedents over the previous 30 years that address ATS suits alleging violations of customary international law, the scope of liability is determined by customary international law itself. *Under Supreme Court precedent, the ATS requires courts to apply norms of international law, not domestic law, to the scope of defendants' liabilities. The norms must be \\"specific, universal and obligatory\\". *Under international law, \\"corporate liability is not a discernible‚Äîmuch less a universally recognized‚Äînorm of customary international law,\\" and the court could apply to the ATS. Also, the plaintiffs' ATS claims should indeed be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Kiobel petitioned the Supreme Court for review of the Second Circuit's decision. It was granted on October 17, 2011. Oral arguments were held on February 28, 2012, with Kathleen Sullivan arguing for Shell and Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler arguing as a friend to Kiobel. The arguments received considerable attention in the legal community. Unexpectedly, the Supreme Court announced, on March 5, 2012, that it would hold additional argument on the case during the October 2012 term. It directed the parties to file new briefs on the question \\"Whether and under what circumstances the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1350, allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.\\" Reargument of the case occurred on October 1, 2012, with Sullivan reappearing for Shell and the United States Solicitor General Donald Verrilli now arguing as a friend to Kiobel. Decision The Court, in an opinion joined by five justices, held that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption. The presumption against extraterritoriality is a canon of statutory interpretation that provides there is no extraterritorial application of a statute unless there is a clear indication otherwise. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Roberts observed that while the presumption applies to merits questions and the ATS is strictly jurisdictional, the canon should still apply to the statute because of the danger of judicial interference in foreign policy.Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. (2013), Slip Opinion at 5. The Court further reasoned that nothing in the text, history or purposes of the ATS rebuts the presumption. The common law transitory torts doctrine, which holds that causes based on a transitory action arising abroad may be considered as happening domestically, helps rebut the presumption, as the statute may have other meanings.Kiobel, Slip Op at 8. The Court also disregarded a 1795 opinion by Attorney General William Bradford that \\"there can be no doubt\\" of tort liability for American citizens who had been plundering inside Sierra Leone.Kiobel, Slip Op at 11. Because the wording \\"defies a definitive reading,\\" the opinion does not counter the presumption.Kiobel, Slip Op at 12. Finally, the Court found it would be implausible to suppose that the First Congress wanted to make the United States a \\"uniquely hospitable forum for the enforcement of international norms.\\"Kiobel, Slip Op. at 12. The opinion nevertheless did not completely eliminate federal court jurisdiction over ATS claims that arise out of overseas conduct since the presumption against extraterritoriality can be displaced when claims \\"touch and concern the territory of the United States... with sufficient force.\\" =Concurrences= Justice Kennedy separately wrote a one-paragraph concurrence noting that the presumption against extraterritorial application \\"may require some further elaboration and explanation.\\" Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the statute does not apply extraterritorially and argued that it should be read to apply to only the international law violations that had been identified by William Blackstone in 1769: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.133 S. Ct. 1659, 1670, (Alito, J., concurring). Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, concurred with the judgment but rejected the Court's reasoning. The four justices did not believe that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the ATS.Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Opinion at 1. Instead, the concurrence sees ATS jurisdiction as limited to when the tort occurs on American soil, the defendant is an American national, or when there is an important American national interest like not providing safe harbor to , or the common enemy of mankind.Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Opinion at 7. Breyer first attacks the majority‚Äôs view that the presumption is not rebutted. He notes that while the majority sees the ATS as applying to piracy on the high seas, piracy necessarily occurs aboard a ship and so is considered to occur within the territory of the ship‚Äôs flag state.Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Opinion at 4. He then outlines the long history of an international duty to not provide safe harbor to hostis humani generis, or the common enemy of mankind.Kiobel, (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Op. at 8, citing, inter alia, Leval, Pierre N. \\"The Long Arm of International Law.\\" 92 Foreign Affairs 16 (Mar./Apr. 2013). He then reviews thirty years of U.S. Court of Appeals cases holding for extraterritorial application of the ATS.Kiobel, (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Op. at 9-10. The concurrence takes issue with the majority's characterization of the ATS as \\"uniquely hospitable\\" by noting that many countries permit extraterritorial suits, citing Dutch, English, International Court of Justice, and European Commission sources.Kiobel, (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Op. at 11. The Court's concern on unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign affairs is rejected by Breyer, who notes US obligations under the Convention Against Torture, the third Geneva Convention, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and several other treaties. Ultimately, however, the concurrence agrees with the Court's judgment, as the mere corporate presence of a foreign defendant who did not directly engage in committing atrocities abroad does not invoke a national interest in denying safe harbor to a common enemy of mankind.Kiobel, (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), Slip Op. at 16.

Development  To minimize accidental capture of marine animals, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries developed and tested bycatch reduction devices (BRDs). These devices are openings in shrimp trawl nets that allow finfish or other unwanted aquatic animals to escape, while the target species, such as shrimp, is directed towards the tail bag or cod end of the net. The placement and design have been developed in conjunction with normal bottom trawling practices, using trawl nets outfitted with a turtle excluder device. BRDs are required in shrimp trawl nets working in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions.  Legal imperative  Officially, National Standard 9 was added to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1996 to address the need to control the magnitude of bycatching. The standard mandates minimizing bycatch to the extent practicable and minimizing mortality of unavoidable bycatch.https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/600.350 Congress increased requirements to protect this harvest in the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. In response to these mandates, NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service) developed an ongoing by-catch plan and published Amendment 10Shrimp Fishery Management Plan to the Fisheries Management Plan of the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council. In conjunction with the plan, NOAA fisheries and other agencies collect data in order to monitor the extent and type of bycatch in all U.S. fishery regions. The associated research plan for the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic fisheries is available online. A portion of the Sea Grant website is dedicated to providing information and an archive of articles about the conservation efforts of commercial shrimpers associated with the use of BRDs in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions.  Research  Between 1990 and 1996, research in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic shrimp trawl fisheries examined the proportions of catch and bycatch by weight. The data indicated that catches in the Gulf consisted of about 67 percent finned fish, 16 percent commercial shrimp, 13 percent non-commercial shrimp, and 4 percent other invertebrates. In the South Atlantic, the catch averaged 51 percent finned fish, 18 percent commercial shrimp, 13 percent non-commercial shrimp and crustaceans, and 18 percent non-crustacean invertebrates (by weight). After insertion of various types of BRDs in the shrimp trawl nets, significant reductions were noted for Spanish mackerel, weakfish, croakers and spot in the South Atlantic region and for Atlantic croakers, king mackerel, Spanish mackerel and red snapper in the Gulf region. Red snapper conservation is one of the primary reasons for interest in BRDs by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. During 1997 and 1998, trawls in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions were required to insert and use a BRD in their nets. This device is installed in the cod end of a shrimp trawl for the purpose of excluding finfish from the net. Since then, NOAA fisheries have certified three types of BRDs for use in the Gulf of Mexico region: the Gulf Fisheye, the Jones-Davis, and the Fisheye BRDs; and five for the south Atlantic region: the Extended Funnel, Expanded Mesh, Fisheye, Gulf Fisheye and Jones-Davis BRDs. According to research conducted during 2003-2004, the Extended Funnel BRD and an Expanded Mesh BRD were found to be successful in the South Atlantic, while the 12‚Äù by 5‚Äù Fisheye BRD was considered successful in both South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters. These conclusions are subject to continuing research. References  External links  Environmental impact of fishing ","title":"Bycatch reduction device"},{"id":"36565180","text":"Poku is a surname.

The audience tends to be in the gender-bender spirit with many of the mostly lesbian audience also cross-dressed in male attire with fake facial hair. Background and history Drag kings are mostly female performance artists who dress in masculine drag and personify male gender stereotypes as part of their routine. A typical show may incorporate dancing and singing, sometimes live or lip- synching to pre-recorded tracks. Drag kings often perform as exaggeratedly macho male characters, portray marginalized masculinities such as construction workers, rappers, or \\"fag drag,\\" or they will impersonate male celebrities like Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Tim McGraw.

In a 2008 publication, he was referred to as the \\"doyen of Turkish sociology.\\" Early life and education Mardin was born in Istanbul in 1927. His father was ≈ûemsettin Mardin, a Turkish ambassador. ≈ûemsettin Mardin was a member of very long- established family and was uncle to Arif Mardin and Betul Mardin. ≈ûerif Mardin's mother was Reya Mardin who was the daughter of Ahmet Cevdet, the founder of an Ottoman newspaper called ƒ∞kdam. Mardin completed high school education in the US in 1944. He obtained a bachelor of arts degree in political sciences at Stanford University in 1948. Then he received a master of arts degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins University in 1950. He completed PhD studies in political science at Stanford University in 1958. His PhD dissertation was published by Princeton University Press with the title of The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought in 1962. Academic career Mardin began his academic career at the Faculty of Political Science, Ankara University, in 1954 and his tenure lasted until 1956. Then he worked as a research associate at the Department of Oriental Studies of Princeton University from 1958 to 1961. He worked as a research fellow at the Middle East Institute of Harvard University for one year (1960-1961).

His academic studies at Ankara University continued until 1973. He also taught courses at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara from 1967-69. Then he worked at the Department of Political Science of Boƒüazi√ßi University from 1973 to 1991. Next, Mardin joined the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of Sabanci University in 1999. He worked at Istanbul ≈ûehir University for four years until 2017.\\"Prof. Dr. ≈ûerif Mardin'i Kaybettik\\" (in Turkish). Istanbul ≈ûehir University. Retrieved 2 September 2019 In addition to these academic posts, Mardin also worked as a visiting professor at different universities, including Columbia University, Princeton University, University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Berkeley, Oxford University, Ecoles des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and Syracuse University. Views Focusing on the Ottoman Empire, Mardin develops many hypotheses about the societal structure of Ottomans. For instance, he argued that in the Ottoman Empire, there was no 'civil society' in the Hegelian terms that could operate independently of central government and was based on property rights. Therefore, the lack of civil society led to a difference in the social evolution and political culture in Ottoman society in contrast to Western societies. Mardin applied the terms center and periphery to the Ottoman society, and concluded that the society consisted of city dwellers, including the Sultan and his officials and nomads. In his view the center included city dwellers, and the periphery nomads. The integration of center and periphery was not achieved. These two societal characteristics, namely the existence of center and periphery, and the lack of successful integration of them, also existed in the modern Turkish society and remained to be the major duality in Turkey. Mardin also emphasized the importance of Jon Turks' thought, addressing the attention of the English-speaking world. He analysed the thought of Said Nursi, who was part of this movement in the early years of his life. Instead of following mainstream accounts of the modernization process in Turkey, he adopted an alternative approach in this regard. He claimed that Turkish modernization is multi-dimensional. Therefore, reductionism in the form of binary accounts that were resulted from Kemalism cannot provide a satisfactory analysis of Turkish modernism. On the other hand, Mardin maintained that the gap between center and periphery continued during the process of Turkish modernization. Mardin also dealt with the achievements of Kemalism. For him, Kemalism has been unsuccessful. But, the reason for this underachievement is not related to the fact that it has been insensitive to popularly held beliefs. Instead, Kemalism cannot be sufficiently linked to the heritage of Enlightenment. In short, Kemalism could not develop texts and philosophy of ethics to describe itself and to pass over next generations. Mardin coined the concept of \\"Turkish Exceptionalism\\" to reveal the reasons for the Turks in dealing with Islam and their vision of the state in a different fashion in contrast to other Moslem countries. Mardin objected the idea that the separation between religion and the state in Turkey was a product of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk‚Äôs movement. Instead, he argued that this separation began during the Ottoman period. Concerning secularism, Mardin also posited a view that reflects the exceptional use of the term in Turkey. He stated that secularism in Turkey does not refer to a hostile state approach towards religion. Instead, secularism for Turks means that the state comes before religion by just ‚Äúone millimeter‚Äù. Mardin further asserts that religion, Islam in this context, and its representatives, including clerics, function as a mediator between the individual and the state. Islam was also a unifying code for those in the periphery during the late period of the Ottoman Empire. In 2007, he coined the term ‚Äúcommunity pressure‚Äù (\\"Mahalle baskƒ±sƒ±\\" in Turkish) to describe a sociological reality that has been experienced in the secular Turkish society as a result of raising of Islamic lifestyle in the country. Works =Books= Mardin published many books on religion, modernization, and society in the context of Turkey, and some of them are given as follows: *Religion and Social Change in Modern Turkey: The Case of Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1989 *The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought: A Study in the Modernization of Turkish Political Ideas, Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, July 2000 *Laicism in Turkey, ƒ∞stanbul: Konrad Adenauer Foundation Press, March 2003 *Center and periphery in the Ottoman Empire, New York: Syracuse University Press 2005 *The nature of nation in the late Ottoman Empire, Leiden: ISIM 2005 *Religion, society, and modernity in Turkey, Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, July 2006 References 20th-century scholars 1927 births 2017 deaths Ankara University faculty Boƒüazi√ßi University faculty Johns Hopkins University alumni METU Mustafa Parlar Foundation Science Award winners Sabancƒ± University faculty Stanford University alumni Turkish political scientists Turkish social scientists Turkish sociologists ","title":"≈ûerif Mardin"},{"id":"36565535","text":"La donna velata (c. 1516); the pearl (Latin: margarita) adorning her hair may allude to the name of Raphael's mistress and model; her stray curl exemplifies the \\"studied carelessness\\" or sprezzatura celebrated in The Book of the Courtier by his friend Baldassare Castiglione; height , width ; at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence Margarita Luti (also Margherita Luti or La Fornarina, \\"the baker's daughter\\") was the mistress and model of Raphael. The story of their love has become \\"the archetypal artist‚Äìmodel relationship of Western tradition\\", yet little is known of her life. Of her, Flaubert wrote, in his Dictionary of Received Ideas, \\"Fornarina. She was a beautiful woman. That is all you need to know.\\"\\"Fornarina. C‚Äô√©tait une belle femme; inutile d‚Äôen savoir plus long\\" Life According to Vasari, Raphael was a \\"very amorous man and affectionate towards the ladies\\".\\"Fu Rafaello persona molto amoroso, & affezzionata alle donne\\" He is said to have painted portraits of his mistress and to have assigned the engraver il Baviera to serve as her page. When commissioned by Agostino Chigi to decorate the Villa Farnesina, he was unable to dedicate himself properly to his work due to his infatuation - until she was allowed to come to live at his side. Again according to Vasari, it was Raphael's immoderate indulgence in \\"amorous pleasures\\", one day taken to excess, that brought on the fever which led to the young artist's death in 1520. Although in the Pantheon he lies beside his fianc√©e Maria, daughter of his patron Bernardo Dovizi, Raphael had long delayed his marriage; on his deathbed he sent his mistress away \\"with the means to live an honest life\\". Margarita is not mentioned by Vasari but is named twice in sixteenth-century marginalia to the second edition of his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, beside the passage describing La donna velata: \\"portrait of Margarita, Raphael's mistress ... Margarita\\".\\"rittratto di Margarita donna di Rafaello ... Margarita\\" By the mid-eighteenth century she was referred to as La Fornarina. In a letter of 1806, Melchior Missirini recounted the tale of their first meeting, of how Raphael fell in love after watching her as she bathed her feet in the Tiber in the garden beside his house in Trastevere, only to discover that \\"her mind was as beautiful as her body\\". Although this story is retold in Passavant's 1839 Life of Raphael and elsewhere, Missirini was known for his \\"pseudo-traditions\\"; se non √® vero, √® ben trovato. In 1897 a document was discovered indicating that Margherita, widowed daughter of Francesco Luti of Siena, retired to the Convent of Santa Apollonia four months after Raphael's death. A small residence in Via di Santa Dorotea is now identified as her former home, one of three possible sites examined by Lanciani. In a recent article Giuliano Pisani, Le Veneri di Raffaello (tra Anacreonte e il Magnifico, il Sodoma e Tiziano, Ediart. Studi di Storia dell'Arte 26, 2015, pp. 97-122 Giuliano Pisani showed that the title ‚ÄúFornarina‚Äù (first used by engraver Domenico Cunego in 1772) is rooted in a linguistic tradition, documented, among others, by the Greek poet Anacreon in the 6th century BCE and found in numerous literary texts from antiquity to the modern period. In this tradition, the italian words ‚Äúforno‚Äù (‚Äúoven‚Äù) and its cognate ‚Äúfornaia‚Äù (‚Äúwoman baker‚Äù) etc. metaphorically indicate the female sexual organ and the woman prostitute. We must understand ‚Äúwhat‚Äù the Fornarina represents as opposed to ‚Äúwho she is‚Äù, and Pisani advanced the hypothesis that Raphael, drawing his inspiration from Marsilio Ficino and Pietro Bembo, portrays in the ‚ÄúFornarina‚Äù the celestial Venus, namely the type of love that raises the soul toward the search for truth by means of the ‚Äúcelestial‚Äù beauty. This Venus differs from the other Venus, the ‚Äúterrestrial‚Äù Venus, namely the generating power of nature, who is connected with the terrestrial beauty and has procreation as her goal (the same interpretation for Titian, L‚Äôamor sacro e l‚Äôamor profane, Rome, Galleria Borghese). From this viewpoint, the ‚ÄúFornarina‚Äù is interconnected with the ‚ÄúVelata‚Äù, whom Pisani identifyes as the terrestrial Venus, the bride, the mother. Art La Fornarina Two portraits by Raphael are identified as those of Margarita, La Fornarina, where she is naked from the waist up, and, rather more demure, La donna velata. The former was already the subject of several early testimonies before featuring in a 1642 inventory of the Barberini collection. X-ray analysis during restoration work at the beginning of the twenty-first century, sponsored by Est√©e Lauder, revealed a ring with a ruby on the third finger of her left hand. She wears a ribbon with the artist's name; the ring may hint at betrothal and the depth of their bond. The latter work is identified by Vasari as a portrait of Raphael's mistress, \\"whom he loved until he died, and of whom he made a most beautiful portrait, which seems spirited and alive\\".\\"laquale Raffaello am√≥ fino alla morte, & di quella fece un ritratto bellissimo, che pareva viva viva\\" She also served as his model for the Virgin and in other religious works: her features have been traced in the Madonna della seggiola, the Madonna di Foligno, the kneeling figure in the Transfiguration, the Stanze di Raffaello, the Ecstasy of St. Cecilia, and in Galatea. In the five or six sonnets attributed to the painter, the Petrarchan theme of ideal love is prominent; in one, perhaps apocryphal, there is an accompanying drawing sometimes identified as being of La Fornarina. In addition, in his later years in Rome Raphael was one of the first Italian artists to consistently draw female figures from female models rather than the usual garzoni or young male assistants, and Luti probably modelled for many of the hundreds of his drawings that survive. Vasari is said by Anthony Blunt to have invented the legend of Raphael. The \\"Raphael-Fornarina myth\\" has been reimagined ever since \\"to fit the expectations of contemporary generations\\". In Comolli's 1790 Life of Raphael, she is blamed for his death. In Balzac's Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes, she is the femme fatale or belle juive. In Joseph M√©ry's 1854 novel Rapha√´l et la Fornarine, Raphael instead complains to the pope of the lack of blonde female models in Rome. For Baudelaire, hers were \\"the affections of a courtesan\\". Byron, struck by La donna velata while in Florence, styled his Venetian mistress Margherita Cogni as La Fornarina. Caroline Norton wrote a sonnet in which Raphael tells Pope Leo X that she is his eyes. Nabokov suggests there was a feud between Raphael and Sebastiano del Piombo over rivalry for her affections, perhaps inspired by the former's La Fornarina and the latter's Portrait of a Woman, also known as La Fornarina. In 1820, for the three hundredth anniversary of Raphael's death, Turner exhibited a painting (:it:Roma vista dal Vaticano) of Raphael with La Fornarina. A pastel by Achille Dev√©ria has Raphael paint her as she lies unrobed in their bed. A drawing by Fulchran-Jean Harriet shows the artist expiring in her arms. Ingres painted five versions of their amour, including those of 1814 and of 1840, and identified himself with the Renaissance artist. Callcott's Raffaelle and the Fornarina inspired a mezzotint of the same name by John Sartain. Among the drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, is Quartier Latin, the Modern Raphael and his Fornarina. Picasso included a series of sexually explicit images of Raphael and La Fornarina in his 347 Suite, as a tribute to Ingres. In Enrico Guazzoni's 1944 film La fornarina, Margherita is played by L√≠da Baarov√°, Goebbels' mistress.

Early life and career Nam was born in Uiseong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in public administration from Konkuk University, and also spent two years working for Korea Housing & Commercial Bank (ÌïúÍµ≠Ï£ºÌÉùÏùÄÌñâ, now part of KB Kookmin Bank). He moved to the United States in 1982, settling in Southern California.

He also served as head of the Korean-American Federation of Los Angeles and the Korean-American Chamber of Commerce. Federation of Korean Associations, USA In May 2009, Nam was elected as the 23rd president of the Federation of Korean Associations, USA. Among other activities as president, he spoke out in favour of efforts to raise voter turnout among South Koreans in the United States, noting that while there might be as many as 900,000 potential voters in the Los Angeles metropolitan area alone, there was only one polling place, which could take as much as two hours' travel for some voters to reach.

This position required him to be a South Korean citizen and not hold any foreign citizenships; however, he was unable to give up his U.S. citizenship by the deadline a month after he had been named to the position, and so his nomination was cancelled. His appointment with the U.S. embassy in Seoul to renounce citizenship was held in September. His renunciation was confirmed by a notice in the Federal Register in July 2012.

It is an English-language remake of Alain Corneau's 2010 thriller film Love Crime, but with the ending greatly altered. The film is an international co-production between France and Germany. The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Plot Christine, an American advertising executive working in Germany, is working with her prot√©g√© Isabelle on an ad campaign for a new smartphone. Isabelle, who is secretly having an affair with Christine's boyfriend Dirk, comes up with a well-received marketing idea. When Christine claims it as her own, Isabelle is disappointed but reconciles with her boss when Christine shares the story of how her twin sister died. At the urging of her loyal assistant Dani, Isabelle uploads a self-made version of her ad to the web, where it goes viral. Angered at the attention Isabelle has received, Christine vows revenge, taunting her with a sex tape which Isabelle had made with Dirk. After an angry Isabelle crashes her car in the company's parking garage, Christine shares the security footage with the rest of the company, humiliating Isabelle who spirals into a depression and begins abusing pills. Christine tries to get Dani fired and then threatens Isabelle with a letter she typed on Isabelle's computer vowing revenge. After Christine is found dead, Isabelle is arrested and confesses to the murder while in a drug-induced stupor. Based on her confessions, the revenge note, and fibres matching a scarf which Isabelle was seen wearing, the police charge her with murder. However, they drop the charges when they discover someone who saw Isabelle at the ballet that night and when Dani discovers Isabelle's scarf, undamaged, in her apartment. The police learn that Dirk, who was in the neighbourhood at the time of the murder, had been embezzling money and Christine discovered this. When they find a bloody scarf in his car they arrest him. Eventually, it is revealed that Isabelle had murdered Christine, and set everything up to convince everyone that she was having a nervous breakdown while framing Dirk for the crime. Dani, who is secretly in love with Isabelle, reveals that she had captured Isabelle on video at various moments during the night of the murder. Dani then tries to blackmail Isabelle into becoming her lover. That night, Isabelle has a strange dream where she strangles Dani after being seduced by her, but not before Dani sends the video incriminating Isabelle to the investigating detective. Suddenly, Christine's twin sister appears and strangles Isabelle from behind with a bloodstained scarf. The next moment, Isabelle wakes up in her own bedroom from her nightmare only to face a new one with Dani lying dead at the foot of her bed.

Koch Production Noomi Rapace was cast as Isabelle after De Palma ran into a director in New York who was interested in having Rapace in his film. The director gave De Palma some of Rapace's Swedish films, and De Palma was impressed by Rapace's performances. He saw Rachel McAdams' performance in Mean Girls and decided to cast her as Christine. For the film, De Palma had initially written a sequence inspired by Inception (2010), saying \\"I had this incredibly complicated commercial based on Inception with three dreams on top of each other, they finally get to the vault and there's the phone. It was elaborate and some of my director friends looked at this and said, 'Come on! Get rid of that Inception thing. Do something else ... I said, 'I love this Inception thing.' De Palma ended up discarding the idea. The film was shot in Berlin. Notable landmarks included the DZ Bank building. De Palma used 35mm film to shoot the film. Release Passion screened in competition at the 69th Venice International Film Festival in September 2012. Metrodome, the film's UK distributor, sent the film straight to DVD and video on demand, stating that: \\"Brian De Palma has an in-built fan base, but a genre like this can be difficult to release theatrically. It's a turbulent theatrical market and we felt this was the best way to launch the film to UK audiences.\\" Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 33% based on 70 reviews, and an average rating of 5.49/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"For better as well as worse, Passion is vintage Brian De Palma sexploitation ‚Äî although with a storyline sillier than most, it fails to generate as much heat as his steamiest work.\\" Metacritic calculates a weighted average score 53 out of 100 based 22 critics, signifying \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Robert Bell of Exclaim! rated the film 8 out of 10, writing: \\"It's just unfortunate that those unfamiliar with the director's work will have absolutely no context for the abstract and oblique tonal shifts or the references, leaving them to dismiss the film as terrible.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B\\" grade and Alan Pyke of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. Peter Sobczynski of Roger Ebert.com gave the film a four-star rating, calling it \\"a spellbinding thriller\\", and DePalma \\"one of the great seducers of cinema\\". Neil Young of The Hollywood Reporter reviewed the film negatively, commenting that \\"the impression is that De Palma is indulging himself with homages to his own Hitchcockian greatest hits, with results that veer close to self-parody on occasion and emphasize just how far this once-outstanding director's creative star has plummeted.\\" Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called the film a \\"sleekly trashy misfire\\". Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Bruce DeMara of Toronto Star gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, describing the film as \\"a pale imitation of the auteur's best work\\". Brian Clark of Twitch Film published a mixed review, while Ben Sachs of Chicago Reader wrote a favorable review, noting that De Palma interweaves themes such as corporate power, advertising, sexual desire, sadomasochistic relationships, and longing for love with a musicality comparable to his visual style. Calum Marsh of Esquire writes: \\"What makes Passion such a distinctively modern take on the now- antiquated erotic thriller is that it has a keen sense of humor about itself\\". Box office Released in fourteen theatres, Passion was positioned in 54th place at the box office during the weekend of its release, with a corresponding total revenue of US$33,400‚Äîafter four weeks, the film's total takings were US$92,181.

In 1996 C√©sar Alcaraz joined the band as vocalist. His style goes together amazingly well with the musical conception of the band. From that moment, the recording project of its first album called Samsara arose.Los alicantinos Numen venden su primer disco en todo el mundo  Edici√≥n impresa  EL PA√çS Samsara (sanscrit word: reincarnations cycle) is a conceptual record in which we try to show all the things that surround the man as an integrating part of Cosmos. Each song of the CD is related to some of the vital matters which influence straight to the human being (cultural backgrounds, freedom, love, the old age,...). The record is composed by nine songs starting from different musical plannings which drive us to some free structural developments. Melody and the instrumental arrangements create some atmospheres which bring the listener to each one of the situations reflected by the lyrics. Numen, due to this first album, made themselves known through prog rock catalogs from Italy, UK, USA and Japan, among other countries. Besides, Samsara had very good reviews all over the world. In 2000 Numen was dissolved as a band. Its members are engaged from that time to their personal projects. After a long separation, Numen members have got together, on the one hand, to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the release of Samsara in 2013, and, on the other hand, to publish a new album. Nowadays, Numen is promoting their second work Numenclature. This album means a high degree of maturity on their music. The songs included in Numenclature cover several styles such as classical rock, prog rock, folk, etc. As it happened fifteen years ago, Numen has had a great deal of good reviews again. Despite the global crisis suffered by the music industry, Numenclature has found a place in the prog rock catalogs from around the world. Besides the new CD, the filmmaker Alejandro Moreno has just launched a DVD called ‚ÄúNumenclature. A journey in progressive‚Äù devoted to prog rock in Spain through the making of Numenclature. Furthermore, taking advantage of social networks, a videoclip has been filmed based on the song ‚ÄúThe camel‚Äôs back‚Äù in order to announce the reunion and the return of Numen. At the end of 2014, Antonio Valiente, guitarist from Numen, left the group and was replaced by Marcos Bevi√°. Since this moment, a new stage begins in which, instead of falling into a long lethargy like the one that occurred after the publication of Samsara in 1998, Numen performs concerts for the presentation of his second album Numenclature. This second work was received positively by specialized critics. Meanwhile, Numen takes advantage of this new impulse to undertake a new musical project that will be published in March 2019. On this occasion, Numen aims to publish his new album titled Cyclothymia in vinyl format. Cyclothymia (consisting of six tracks) is perhaps the darkest album of Numen. It is not a conceptual disc, although it approaches it by virtue of the exploration that is made of those moods in which the human being submerges when life becomes a burden and a torment. In contrast, there are other less bucolic themes, such as \\"Lady of the winds\\" or \\"A cosmic prayer\\", which extol the value of the little things that surround us. Only the first theme, \\"The man with the X-Ray Eyes\\", is out of this line, to become a parody theme that criticizes the ease with which the human being makes value judgments. In 2019 Numen signs with the record label Mylodon Records.http://mylodonrecords.com/numen-llega-a-mylodon- records-para-entregar-su-nueva-nomenclatura-en-cyclothymia/  Discography  *Albums # Samsara (1998)\\"La Caja de M√∫sica\\": Lista de Correo # Numenclature (2014) # Cyclothymia (2019) *Other recordings # Birth (1995) (demo) Filmography # ‚ÄúNumenclature.

Since the 1930s it has been the headquarters of Chester Zoo. The house and its stables are recorded separately in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings. History The house was built in about 1885 for B. Chaffers Roberts, and designed by Edward Ould. The stables are dated 1886, and were probably also designed by Ould. The house was extended in 1892 for the same client by Harry Beswick, and some alterations have been made during the 20th century. In 1930 George Mottershead bought the house and estate for ¬£3,500 (), and started the development of Chester Zoo. While the house was used for administration, the west wing of the stables was used to house lions. As the zoo has grown, the house has been retained and converted for use as a business, educational and wedding venue, and the west wing of the stables for storage. Architecture =House= Oakfield Manor is constructed in red Ruabon brick with blue-brick diapering, and red sandstone dressings. It is roofed with Welsh slate. There are four brick chimney stacks with Tudor-style decoration. The house is in two and 2¬Ω storeys, with a west front of four bays, and a south front with three projecting bays with differing details. The architectural features include two-storey canted bay windows with a castellated parapet and dormers, differently shaped gables, and a projecting porch with a finial in the form of a griffin. Most of the windows have mullions and transoms. Inside the house is much wood panelling and some stained glass in the windows. =Stables= These are constructed in orange brick with dressings in red brick and buff sandstone. It is roofed with red tiles. The building is in one and two storeys, with a frontage of five bays. In the centre is an archway, with a datestone flanked by plaques with horses' heads. To the right of the archway is a circular stair turret surmounted by a hexagonal spire. On the base of the turret are marks of lions' claws.

In 2010, thirty-three years after its release, the song won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance after being rereleased as a live track on A Touch of Evil: Live. Description and analysis \\"Dissident Aggressor\\" closes the album Sin After Sin, and is segu√©d into from the slow ballad \\"Here Come the Tears\\". It is played aggressively on two guitars at a fast tempo; the bass and drums are heavy, and the vocals are screamed at high pitch. The song features what Rolling Stone describes as \\"driving guitar riffs\\", and guitarists K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton trade solos in the song. Rolling Stone further describes the song as an \\"apocalyptic epic\\". Influence on the genre Judas Priest's 1977 album Sin After Sin introduced the combination of the double bass drum and rapid 16th bass rhythms combined with rapid 16th note guitar rhythms that came to define the genre. While the double-bass rhythms from Judas Priest are generally measured and technical, \\"Dissident Aggressor\\" pushed this to be an example of the style with an increase in \\"tempo and aggression\\" which was later adopted by other bands with a much harder-edged approach. The song features \\"groundbreaking vocal styles\\" by Rob Halford which have since come to be regarded as influential. US thrash metal band Slayer covered the song on their 1988 album South of Heaven. Ironically, Slayer were nominated for the \\"Best Metal Performance Grammy Award\\" in 2010, for the song \\"Hate Worldwide\\", but lost out to Priest's new live version, mentioned above. The song was also covered by US rock band Halestorm on their 2013 covers EP Reanimate 2.0: The Covers.

The city officials had proposed building other low income housing elsewhere in the city. Public housing officials and private developers were in favor of demolishing the housing, while preservationists and residents were in favor of keeping the housing. The private developers hoped to have higher income housing and commercial use. The HACH, during this time, moved its headquarters into a building in River Oaks. Jim Sherman of the Houston Press stated in 1993 that in addition to the practical desire for redevelopment, much of the impetus was a determination of the politically connected to get the complex demolished after initially running into roadblocks against the goal. Sherman stated that the population loss and decline of APV were \\"by design\\". HACH officials asserted that the agency filed the first demolition permit in 1984. According to press reports, HACH had sent secret requests for razing the complex in 1977, which employees of the federal housing authority at the time disapproved of, and in 1981. Beginning in the 1970s thousands of Vietnamese refugees moved to Allen Parkway Village,Swartz, Mimi. \\"Murder in the Melting Pot.\\" Texas Monthly. Emmis Communications, December 1991.

HACH had deliberately placed them there, according to Wallstin, \\"in an attempt to pave the political pitfalls to its then-secret demolition plans\\". A report prepared for HACH stated the agency's belief that the Asians would, compared to other racial groups, not put up as much resistance to agency moves to eliminate APV. The existence of the report was later revealed by lawyers representing ethnic Vietnamese clients. At APV Asians encountered crime and tensions with existing black residents.Swartz, Mimi. \\"Murder in the Melting Pot.\\" Texas Monthly. Emmis Communications, December 1991. Vol. 19, No. 12.

The Handbook of Texas said \\"In the 1980s and 1990s the continued future of the Fourth Ward as a black community came under serious attack\\" due to plans to demolish Allen Parkway Village and replace the complex with housing for high income people and office buildings. In a Handbook of Texas entry the citizen opposition and \\"more importantly\\" the mid-1980s economic decline delayed those plans. The Handbook of Texas said that the neglect of the housing units and the resulting disappearance of those units, the reluctance of investors to invest capital into the Fourth Ward, and \\"future of the neighborhood\\" all \\"undermined\\" \\"[t]he viability\\" of the Fourth Ward.Wintz, Cary. ‚ÄúFourth Ward, Houston.‚Äù The Handbook of Texas Online. 26 Sept 2008. < http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hpf01> The HACH made a unanimous vote to demolish Allen Parkway Village. The official demolition permission application and sale request were made in 1984 and 1985, respectively. However activist Lenwood Johnson began campaigning against the demolition of the complex. Former HACH spokesperson Esther De Ipolyi stated that the agency employees were surprised at the level of resistance they received towards their plans, and that such resistance was unprecedented in Houston. She described Johnson as \\"one lone ranger who essentially stopped the process.\\" University of Houston sociology professor Bill Simon described Johnson as \\"The only person among the residents who had any legal standing\\" to bring a challenge to its demolition. Johnson went into conflict with two HACH executive directors, at first an African-American named Earl Phillips, and later with Joy Fitzgerald. Local filmmaker Christine Felton stated that she \\"was surprised at how personal the fight between Lenwood and Joy became.\\" Johnson first opposed an attempted eviction of 125 Southeast Asian families, who he said had been extorted by HACH employees, until 1986. HACH had filed another demolition petition in 1984, but Houston City Council withdrew it in 1989. Johnson pressured Mickey Leland, a Congressperson, into supporting an amendment that would prohibit HACH from funding APV's demolition with money from the federal government; Johnson stated that Leland initially balked at the request. In 1988 Allen Parkway Village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Johnson personally went to Washington, DC and met Henry Cisneros, the head of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). For a period Simon advised Johnson; Simon stated that Johnson \\"after a while was constantly tripping over his own ego.\\" Wallstin stated that Johnson eventually became consumed with the fight as he wished to maintain his role as the savior of APV rather than maintaining residences for the disadvantaged, and that Johnson, \\"as even his supporters acknowledged, made the mistake of buying into his own shtick.\\"Wallstin, Brian. \\"Allen Parkway Village: The Movie.\\" Houston Press. Thursday May 6, 1999. Retrieved on January 2, 2019. By 1989 there were 130 families residing in the complex, a decline from the previous amount. Marvin Krislov of the Yale Law Journal noted that HUD had not at the time certified the removal of the housing property, but the population had declined anyway, reflecting how HACH was deliberately causing APV to deteriorate. In August 1990 Felton began recording footage of events related to APV, including protests and meetings that were open to the public and conducted behind closed doors. She initially worked with Johnson, but the two had a conflict as Felton believed his group was trying to get creative control of her film. Simon stated that Felton's footage had major historical significance as she had recorded exclusive footage of key events, such as the meeting between Johnson and Cisneros. The legal campaign reached the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1995 Allen Parkway Village's housing made up 24% of the public housing units in Houston. At the time, 21 of its apartments were occupied. Cisneros was no longer the head of the oversight community of the HUD after the 1994 United States midterm elections, as people of the Republican Party occupied most of the Congressional seats from that point forward. This contributed to the settlement that resolved the Allen Parkway Village issue, at the cost of removing many of its units. =Resolution and aftermath= In 1996 Cisneros signed an agreement to allow the City of Houston to demolish 677 of the community's 963 units as long as the site was still used for low income housing. The older units were brick buildings, while David Ellison of the Houston Chronicle said that the newer units \\"look like any other apartments in Houston\\". The federal government spent $57 million in redeveloping Allen Parkway Village and improving the surrounding area. The remaining old units were placed on the National Register of Historic Places and were not demolished. In 1998 the gravesites that were not discovered in the 1940s grave location were uncovered by excavation movements to create utility services for the new APV development. The HHA did not initially announce this to the public, and spokesperson Robert Reyna stated this was to keep the dignity of the deceased. After the discovery was disclosed, the HHA wished to move these bodies to Brookside while some area residents argued that the bodies should remain where they were. A prayer service for the bodies, reburied in the northeast corner of the facility, was held on March 26, 2001; the HHA moved them to another location to satisfy the demands of those residents wishing for the bodies to remain in their resting places while ensuring the APV project could be completed. By 1999 remaining portions of APV were renamed to The Historic Oaks of Allen Parkway and had around 500 residential units. 16 residential buildings, a community center building, and an administrative building were retained.Cook, Lynn J. \\"New project bringing residents back to Allen Parkway Village.\\" Houston Business Journal.

The first new group of tenants consisted of 156 low income elderly individuals. Allen Parkway Village lost none of its land area. David Ellison of the Houston Chronicle argued that the quest to preserve Allen Parkway Village was \\"quixotic.\\" Johnson said \\"The myth is that the people of Allen Parkway Village lost after a 15- or 20-year fight. That's not true.

In a period before 1980, there were approximately 175 APV residents who were students at Lincoln and about 512 who were students at Gregory; about 37.6% of the Gregory School students were APV residents. Around that period some residents attended Reagan, Yates, and other high schools. Gregory School was consolidated into Lincoln School in 1980.

It is not known if any relationship existed between these families. The surname Denys is just one of many variant spellings of the name: Denise, Le Deneis, Le Danies, le Deneys and most recently Dennis, are some of the others. The family of Denys was apparently of Danish origin,See for example Fuller's \\"Worthies\\", quoted by the Duchess of Cleveland's Battle Abbey Roll and was recorded in early Norman charters in French as le Deneys, meaning \\"The Dane\\", which was frequently Latinised by scribes as Dacus, being the adjectival form of Dacia, the mediaeval Latin for Denmark, thus \\"Danish\\". Denys of Gloucestershire leopard's faces or jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailed azure An early and influential west-country family named Denys seems to have originated in Gloucestershire in the 13th century and to have moved into Glamorgan, where it was resident at Waterton, before moving back to Gloucestershire c. 1380, where it was seated at Siston near Bristol until the late 16th century. This family's arms are the differenced arms of their apparent sometime feudal overlords the Cantilupes, three leopard's faces jessant-de-lys. Several members of this branch of the family became High Sheriff of Gloucestershire. The first was Sir Gilbert Denys (c. 1350 ‚Äì 1422); others included Maurice Denys (c. 1410 ‚Äì 1466), Sir William Denys (1470‚Äì1533) and Henry Dennis (Feb 1594 ‚Äì 26 June 1638). Denys of Somerset Another possibly related 12th- and 13th-century Denys family held the manor of Sock Dennis near Ilchester, in Somerset, from the Beauchamp family, A P Baggs, R J E Bush and Margaret Tomlinson, 'Parishes: Sock Dennis', in A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 3, ed.

White Hall Hospital in Ilchester was founded in about 1217‚Äì1220 by William Dacus/Le Deneis of Sock Dennis, following his gift of a house and other property. During the reigns of Henry II (1154-1189) and Richard I (1189-1199), the royal forest of Petherton Park, near Bridgwater in Somerset, was held from the crown by Osbert and William Dacus by grand serjeanty of being the king's Forester of Petherton.Collinson, Rev. John, History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset, Vol.3, Bath, 1791, p.55 The Somerset Denys family seems to have died out soon after in the male line. No trace of their armorials has survived from which to make a link to other families of the same name. Denys of Devon Arms of Denys of Orleigh: Azure, three Danish battle axes erect or,Vivian, Heraldic Visitationms of Devon, 1895, p.281, pedigree of Denys of Orleigh Josceline le Deneys (whose first name was Latinised to Jollenus, Jellanus or Joscelinus) was recorded in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return submitted by Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in South Devon, as holding from him the manor of Pancrasweek, Black Torrington hundred, North Devon, and de Pomeroy himself held it from Tavistock Abbey. This Jollenus Dacus held Pancrasweek as one knight's fee on military feudal tenure. Orleigh formed a sub-manor of Pancrasweek, but was held by him under the non-military tenure of free socage, that is to say it was a heritable estate the service for which was monetary not military.Calendar of Inquisitions post mortem, 3 James I (Series 2, vol.289, n.76) (quoted by Rogers (1938), p.51, note 6 Dacus held two fees in total from de Pomeroy, as stated in his 1166 return, and the identity of these fees are revealed in the record of the holdings of his descendant Robert le Deneys in the feudal aid of 1285 which shows Pancrasweek forming one, Southwick in Germansweek and Manaton (14 miles north of Berry Pomeroy Castle) forming a half each. In 1285 however Robert le Deneys was holding these manors not from the de Pomeroy barons but from the heirs of Patrick de Chaworth, who was successor in title to Brewer, lord of the manor of Buckland Brewer amongst others, who had himself purchased them from de Pomeroy. The arms adopted by the Devon family of this name at the start of the age of heraldry in about 1200 reflected their supposed origins: Azure, three Danish battle axes or, that is three golden axes on a blue background. A history of this family is contained in the Duchess of Cleveland's \\"Battle Abbey Roll\\", under \\"Denise\\". Arms of Denys of Holcombe Burnell & Bicton A cadet branch of Dennis of Orleigh settled at Holcombe Burnell, 3 miles west of Exeter, and Bicton, 10 miles SE of that city, and bore the arms of Orleigh differenced: Ermine, three Danish battle axes gules (three red battle-axes on a white background with black ermine spots). Robert le Deneys gave Orleigh to his younger son William, whose son John le Deneys was in possession in 1342Pole, p.375;Vivian Visitation, as quoted by Rogers (1938), p.51, note 7 Richard Denys (died 1442), John's grandson, married Elizabeth Bowhay, daughter and heiress of Geoffrey Bowhay of Bowhay. In 1417 Orleigh was occupied by his wife's cousin, also called Elizabeth Bowhay, the daughter of John Bowhay and widow of Thomas Crydia. She was granted in 1417 by Edmund Stafford (died 1419), Bishop of Exeter, licence to have mass performed in her oratory at Orleigh.Register of Bishop Stafford, Vol. I, no.231b, quoted by Rogers (1938), p.51, note 10 Three generations of Denys's each named John followed Richard Denys, the last of whom, John Denys (died 1498) married Eleanor Gifford, daughter and co-heiress of Stephen Gifford of Theoborough. His son was William Denys (born 1472), who was followed by his son Nicholas and the latter's son John Denys (died 1584) who married Dorothy Monk, daughter and co-heiress of Anthony Monk of Potheridge. John settled the reversion of his manor of Farley in Petrockstowe onto the issue of his son William Denys (died 1605) in 1573 on the occasion of his marriage to Mary Vyell, daughter of William Vyell of Trevorder. William contributed ¬£25 to the defences against the Spanish Armada in 1588. He died intestate. His son was Anthony Dennis (1585‚Äì1641), the last of the male line, whose monument can be seen in Buckland Brewer Church. The heir of Denys of Holcombe Burnel and Bicton was the Rolle family of Stevenstone, which in the person of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842), seated at Bicton House, was the largest landowner in Devon possessing some 55,000 acres, now represented by Baron Clinton. =Anthony Dennis (1585‚Äì1641)= Anthony Dennis of Orleigh married twice:Vivian, Lt.Col.

It opened in 1936, and became popular during the 1950s and 1960s, with some celebrities being regulars. Chef Marco Pierre White owned it from 1998 to 2007, and it earned a Michelin star in 2008 under head chef Charlie Rushton, and kept until its closure for refurbishment later that year. It remained closed until the site was demolished in 2016/17.http://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online- applications/applicationDetails.do;jsessionid=FE36731BA2239E46BE47EC7F0AB97559?activeTab=summary&keyVal;=ME3NRIRP01R00 History The restaurant was first opened in 1936. The interior has a single main dining room, and two private dining rooms entitled the Pine Room and the Chinese Room. The restaurant is in the basement. Guests enter at street level and go downstairs. The restaurant became popular following the Second World War, and in the 1950s and 1960s it was seen as the place to be. Regulars of the restaurant included Orson Welles and Winston Churchill. The restaurant was also used to entertain foreign guests of the British Government, such as in February 1962 when Lord Privy Seal Edward Heath dined with the Assistant Foreign Secretary of Yugoslavia. In 1957, the chef and staff of Mirabelle relocated to Paris for a week to promote English food in the French capital. This also involved the temporary overturning of a ban on the importation of English oysters so that a thousand of them from Colchester could be sent for the Mirabelle staff to use there. Other dishes served in Paris included devilled kidneys and silverside of beef served with dumplings. In 1988, the Brent Walker leisure group attempted to buy the restaurant for ¬£3 million in order to convert it partially into a casino. The purchase was made, but the owner of the group George Alfred Walker could not get a casino licence for the premises after his criminal history was publicly revealed. In 1990, the restaurant was purchased by a Japanese billionaire, who renovated it. Mirabelle reopened with a main dining room serving a French Menu and Japanese menu in two tepanyaki room, with an impressive wine list of the best French wines designed by Steven Spurrier. The restaurant never became popular despite the hire of London's best PR agency. The mansion block in which the restaurant was situated was demolished in 2016/17 =Marco Pierre White= Marco Pierre White purchased Mirabelle and re-opened the restaurant in 1998. One of his changes was to install a disco ball as he thought it was romantic, with the overall design created by designer David Collins. Collins had previously worked with White on the interior design of Harveys, and at other restaurants including revamping La Tante Claire on two occasions. His decorations included Venetian glass and leather embellishments. Paintings by Pierre Le Tan were commissioned, and added to drawings by Eugene Berman and ceramics by Pablo Picasso. The designs were later described by food critics as something out of a \\"1920s liner\\". The restoration was filmed for the Channel 5 show Waiting for Marco. When Tim Zagat, founder of the Zagat restaurant guide, attempted to dine at the restaurant, he was ejected from the premises by White. Zagat had given a poor review of one of White's other restaurants, Titantic. White retired from the kitchens of all of his restaurants in 1999, handing back Michelin stars they had earned. Under head chef Charlie Rushton it earned a Michelin star in 2000, however the chef left shortly afterwards and was replaced by Martin Caws, who had been sous chef under White at the Oak Room. Whilst White and his girlfriend Matilde Conejero were dining with Michael Winner at the restaurant in 2000, Winner asked why White hadn't yet had thoughts of marriage. The meal ended with White and Conejero having agreed to get married, although White later admitted that it wasn't exactly a proposal. They had already had two children, and would later have a daughter named Mirabelle. Shortly after celebrating his 40th birthday party at the restaurant in April 2002, White quit as Director amid reports that the establishment was somewhere in the region of ¬£10 million in debt. An auction of a number of bottles of wine from the restaurant was conducted in 2002, expected to raise around ¬£200,000 at Sotheby's, although it was denied that the intention was to raise money to pay off the restaurant's debts. The restaurant hit the press again when a waiter refused to replace a bottle of Penfolds Grange Hermitage 1964 for actor Russell Crowe who said that it was corked. Eventually the waiter relented and replaced the ¬£3,500 bottle, for Crowe and his guest, Connie Nielsen. Other Hollywood actors dined at the restaurant whilst it was owned by White, including Johnny Depp who ate there with partner Vanessa Paradis and spent ¬£17,000 which included ¬£11,000 for a single bottle of Roman√©e-Conti burgundy, and Leonardo DiCaprio who was not recognised by White when the actor thanked the chef for \\"the best meal I've ever had\\". Singer Madonna dined with Guy Ritchie at Mirabelle in 2000, and Kylie Minogue was photographed outside the restaurant in 2002. The Mirabelle was sold by White in 2007 as one of three restaurants sold to Stephen Schaffe and Joseph Ettedgui, as they were no longer making a profit. The duo planned to re-open the restaurant once more, and keep it in the same location. They announced in January 2008 that the restaurant would re-open with a 1930s design, but that the six-month refurbishment would result in some fifty staff members being laid off. However, it was later announced that the restaurant would not open until late 2010. =Menu= Dishes served at Mirabelle under Marco Pierre White were of French cuisine, including various tarte tatins, souffl√©s and sea bass served with fennel and mashed potato. When White took over the restaurant in 1997, he reviewed the historical menus in order to find inspiration for a revamped range and found that not a great deal had changed on the menu since the 1950s. For instance, a borscht soup called \\"Barszcz a la Cracovienne\\" had been on the menu for over twenty years. Previous hors d'oeuvres served in the era before White's influence include ham from either Bayonne or York, crab with avocado, potted shrimp, escargot, and grapefruit. White's newer menu was documented when he wrote The Mirabelle Cookbook, published by Ebury Publishing in 1999, and certain dishes were published in the national press to promote the restaurant. =Legacy= Whilst under White a number of future celebrity chefs were trained, including Australian Curtis Stone who was also involved in the production of The Mirabelle Cookbook. Other chefs to have worked with White there include British television chef Richard Phillips. Chefs that worked at Mirabelle before White included Alberto Crisci, who went on to run the kitchens at High Down prison and launched the restaurant The Clink where inmates served haute cuisine to members of the public inside the prison itself. In addition Stephen Pullman was there after Jean Drease. Other famous chefs at Mirabelle were royal chef Antony Jacobs, he opened a little upscale restaurant based on the Mirabelle menu, this was called Bastille. The Mirabelle cookbook features impossible to copy recipes from Robbie Robinson. Robbie was so secretive he would hide his skills from all other personnel at \\"Mirabelle. The Mirabelle was bought in 1961 by the DeVere group which also owned the Grand Hotel Eastbourne where they created a sister restaurant, also called Mirabelle, which as of 2015 continues as the hotel's fine dining restaurant. However, the Eastbourne restaurant is rather different to the London restaurant's 1998-2008 incarnation as the two were then no longer under common ownership and had no links other than the name. However the Eastbourne restaurant, which has its own separate entrance at the hotel, uses an external blue neon sign like the one familiar to visitors to the London restaurant. Reception Caroline Stacey ate at Mirabelle in 1998 after Marco Pierre White took it over. She described the cooking as \\"timeless\\" with certain courses \\"unforgettable\\" and that the main courses were \\"stellar\\". She didn't think that the dessert options were as good as the rest of the menu however, but selected the restaurant as one of her favourites she had visited that year. Deborah Ross ate at the Mirabelle for The Spectator in May 2000, describing the food as \\"brilliant\\". She was pleased with the presentation of certain dishes, including the salmon terrine which appeared to be a sandcastle and a starter of asparagus with hollandaise sauce which she described as a \\"sweet little bundle like one of those dried-flower arrangements you can buy in National Trust shops\\". Victoria Moore, who wrote a piece on the yorkshire pudding for The Guardian in 2000, described how she was disappointed by the version offered by Mirabelle. It was firstly delivered alongside the rest of the course, and not served ahead of the dish as in Yorkshire tradition and then thought that it had been made richer in order to make it \\"more appealing to toffs\\". By 2006, critic Bryan Appleyard felt that the restaurant had been taken over by the hedge fund industry and had turned into little more than a staff canteen for them, and thought that the service he received at the restaurant was \\"appalling\\" as he was not one of them. As an example, AIG Financial Products who played such a big part in the 2008 financial crash, had their office across the road at 1 Curzon St. =Awards and ratings= In 1999, it was named London's best new restaurant. Whilst under White's ownership, it was first awarded a Michelin star in the 2000 list under the Executive Chef of Charlie Rushton, which it retained until its closure in 2008. In 2007, the restaurant publicly received a poor rating of its hygiene standards, being given only one star out of five by environmental health inspectors. This score was summarised as \\"A poor level of compliance with food safety legislation. Much more effort required.\\" See also * List of restaurants in London References Restaurants established in 1936 Restaurants in London Michelin Guide starred restaurants in the United Kingdom 1936 in London 1936 establishments in England Mayfair Buildings and structures demolished in 2016 ","title":"Mirabelle (London restaurant)"},{"id":"36566381","text":"German submarine U-237 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II.

The plateau covers most of northern Chiba Prefecture. The plateau was historically richly agricultural, but in the 20th century the western and central Shim≈çsa Plateau became one of the major industrial areas of Japan, as well as a large-scale bedroom community of the Tokyo Metropolitan Region. Narita International Airport is located in the center of the Shim≈çsa Plateau. Geography The Shim≈çsa Plateau covers most of northern Chiba Prefecture. The plateau ranges between and above sea level. While the Shim≈çsa Plateau has no set boundaries, it ranges roughly south to north from the B≈çs≈ç Hill Range to the lowlands of the Tone River, and east from the Edo River west to the lowlands of Kuj≈´kuri Beach. The plateau runs from Funabashi to Katori. =Geology= Shim≈çsa Plateau sits above the , a geological group under the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula. The Shim≈çsa Group dates from the Tertiary and Pleistocene periods, and is roughly divided into the Jizodo, Yabu, and Narita formations. The geological group consists primarily of sedimentary layers of loose sand, and secondarily of clay silt and pebbly-sand layers. Above the Shim≈çsa Group are more recent rich, fertile layers of volcanic ash. The Shim≈çsa Plateau yields great deposits of fossils, notably molluscan fossils, as the plateau was originally submerged under water. =Rivers and lakes= Abiko The Shim≈çsa Plateau is crossed by several short, shallow rivers and two small lakes. The Kuriyama River () flows eastward from the central area of the plateau east of Narita International Airport to the Pacific Ocean. The shorter Kido River () similarly flows eastward and empties into the Pacific Ocean in the city of Sanmu. Lake Teganuma originally occupied a large area to the north of the plateau, but has narrowed in modern times due to being sealed off from the Tone River and land reclamation projects. Teganuma historically covered , but after land reclamation now covers . Lake Inbanuma was created by the natural damming of a small valley in the Shim≈çsa Plateau, and originally covered . After land reclamation projects, similar to those carried out on Teganuma, it now covers . =Parks= Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park sits to the northeast of the Shim≈çsa Plateau in Chiba and Ibaraki prefectures. The park was established on March 3, 1953 and protects natural areas and cultural heritage of, among other areas, the Tone River basin directly to the north of the plateau. Imba-Teganuma Prefectural Natural Park was established to protect Lakes Teganuma and Inbanuma, and is located at the north of the plateau. Economy =Early history= Rice paddies, Sawara, Katori The Shim≈çsa Plateau has supported a population since ancient times, as evidenced by the large concentration of J≈çmon period kaizuka or shell middens across the plateau. The plateau was historically located in Shim≈çsa Province, after which it was named, and was a productive agricultural area prior to the industrialization of Japan. The area served to produce rice and vegetables as early as the Nara period. Ranches on the Shim≈çsa Plateau flatlands were developed to raise horses. Additionally, the network of rivers and canals provided for the inland transport of marine products from the Pacific Ocean to Edo. During the Edo period the Shim≈çsa Plateau saw large-scale development of new rice paddies by the Tokugawa shogunate, as well as the further development of horse ranches, specifically the Kogane and Sakura ranches to supply horses to the shogunate. The inland water routes from Ch≈çshi were developed to supply rice, marine products, and vegetables directly to the capital at Edo. =Modern period= Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the Imperial Japanese Army, formerly in Inage-ku, City of Chiba The economic development of the Shim≈çsa Plateau continued after the Meiji restoration of 1868. An extensive rail network was established and replaced the slower canal routes to the capital. Some of undeveloped areas in this plateau, including former ranches of shogunate, turned into military facility of Imperial Japanese Army (Narashinohara), imperial farm (Sanrizuka, Narita), or agricultural colonies, the aid for unemployed Shizoku. Those colonies named after development order, such as: * Hatsutomi (, Kamagaya) * Futawa (, Funabashi) * Misaki (, Funabashi) * Toyoshiki (, Kashiwa) * Gok≈ç (, Matsudo) * Mutsumi (, Matsudo) * Nanae (, Tomisato) * Yachimata (, Yachimata) * Kumiage (, Katori) * Tokura (, Tomisato) * Toyoichi (, Shiroi) * Toyofuta (, Kashiwa) * Toyomi (, Narita, Tako) During the militarization of northern Chiba Prefecture that began in the early 20th century, the eastern area of the plateau was declared a military zone. The Shim≈çsa Plateau was a center of the manufacture of war goods, notably of munitions and military aircraft, and saw the construction of numerous military facilities. Shimofusa Air Base was constructed in 1945 by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force on the border of Kashiwa and Kamagaya. Most of the military facilities and industrial areas on the Shim≈çsa Plateau were destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. =Post-World War II= In the period immediately following World War II the plateau remained agricultural. Primary industry, almost entirely agriculture, accounted for 63% of economic activity, secondary accounted for 12%, and tertiary 25%. Post-war industrial planning resulted in large-scale development of coastal areas on the eastern Shim≈çsa Plateau along Tokyo Bay. Fishing and agricultural areas along the bay were replaced by landfill. The scenery of the eastern plateau went from largely agricultural to a vast area of factory smokestacks and high- rise housing. The development of sprawling port facilities, originally centered on the city of Chiba, culminated in the establishment of Keiy≈ç Industrial Zone. Manufacturing facilities were developed across the central Shim≈çsa Plateau in the same period. Aerial view of Narita International Airport Immediately after World War II, the transportation system of northern Chiba Prefecture was significantly improved. The rail network connecting northern Chiba Prefecture to Tokyo was expanded, allowing the construction of large-scale housing facilities, and northern Chiba Prefecture became a bedroom community of metropolitan Tokyo. The construction of Narita International Airport between 1972 and 1978 resulted in further economic development and population increase on the central Shim≈çsa Plateau. In contrast to the large- scale economic development of the western and central Shim≈çsa Plateau, other parts of Chiba Prefecture saw relatively little economic development and ultimately long-term population decline, notably on the eastern Shim≈çsa Plateau, the Kuj≈´kuri Plain, and entirety of the southern B≈çs≈ç Peninsula. Economy Danchi housing complex, Abiko The Shim≈çsa Plateau remains an important economic center of Japan. Compared to the post-war period, the distribution of economic activity on the plateau has changed. Primary industry accounts for only 5% of economic activity, secondary accounted for 27%, and tertiary 68%. Tertiary industry on the plateau consists of both the service industry serving the densely populated areas of northern Chiba Prefecture, as well as the extensive logistics network connecting the Keiy≈ç Industrial Zone and Narita International Airport with other areas of Japan. While agriculture accounts for a small part of the overall economy on the Shim≈çsa Plateau, the northern and eastern area of the plateau is a large producer of vegetables for the Tokyo Metropolitan Region. The flat, eastern part of the Shim≈çsa Plateau continues to support rice production.

The family‚Äôs financial activities are known to archaeologists via an archive of about 1,700 clay tablets spanning five generations of the family, dating to a period from around 600 to 482 BC. The tablets give us a glimpse of the exchange of goods within southern Mesopotamia and abroad. Many documents found in the archive show shipments of barley, dates, and other bulk items. Enterprises of this nature were financed by the house of Egibi, among other later houses from within Babylon. Familial identity The word Egibi is a transliteration of the Sumerian e.gi-ba-ti.la, a full form used occasionally in archival records. In a text on ancestral names, Babylonian scribes equated it to Sin-taqisha- liblut, which is translated as 'O Sin (the moon god), you have given (the child), may he now live and thrive'. The families name occurs in Babylonian records at a time beginning sometime during the eighth century BC. By the sixth century BC more than 200 individuals are known to history who claimed to be descendants of Egibi.see Tallqvist 1905: s.v.

F. El Peiser (1897) thought the family had nothing to do with Jacob and under later reconsideration the issue with regards to Jacob is thought inconclusively proven by Wallis Budge.

All monies the members of the family used for these purposes were from the houses' own monies rather than the members of the family instead using money which they had from deposits made by others.

This let the men who owned land go and fight in the military for Nebuchadnezzar's purposes.

The town is a medieval village, overlooking the Gulf of the Poets and the Plain of Slim, and is visible from the castles of the Lunigiana.  Monuments and places of interest  The planning of the village, at least in the most important elements, concerns the patterns found in Trebiano and especially Castelnuovo Magra, which predominate in sets of houses and streets with a straight line along the ridge of hills, from which stand the volume of the church and bell tower. At the top of the village stand the ruins of an ancient castle, near rounded knolls, that recall the castles of the Ligurians, a people of shepherds and farmers jealous of their independence. Parts of the castle are much older than the medieval period. According to historian Livy, 40,000 inhabitants of the Ligurian Apuan, and other 7,000 people in the Val di Magra and Vara, the Sannio, were the victims of the first deportation of history, by the consuls Cornelius Cethegus and Mario Bebio. After the deportation, high-wealth families in Rome established their houses and properties along the coast of Luni, on Cordonata Caprione, and in the hills by Arcola Vezzano and Valerian, as recalled by Persio in his Satire. The town's name derives from fundus Valerii or Fundum Valerianum, from one of these families who had possession of the hill for nearly a thousand years. There are no documents in order to date the Romanization of Valerian. However, the Tabula Alimentaria, as emperor Trajan to Velleia, found two centuries ago and kept in the Museum National Parma, among many Velleia funds to contribute to the maintenance of poor children, many bearing the name of Valerian and their owners such as Publius Valerius Ligurino. A document from the June 10, 1033, the time of Conrad the Salic Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, states that the family of the Marquis Adalberto Olbertenghi, race Lombard, makes donation to the monastery founded in Castiglione a portion of its assets and the \\"tenth\\" of its property located in the County of Valerian Luni. Then Valerian was a stronghold of the Malaspina family and the bishops of Luni as reflected by the \\"decision\\" agreed the May 12, 1202 between the Bishop of Luni Gualtiero Marchesi and Albert William and , which shall establish the terms of their domains, and the decree of May 31 published in 1202 1717 by the Masons in \\"Antiquities Este\\" at Modena.Valerian, an angle of Lunigiana between rivers and sea, City of Vezzano Ligure publisher The February 16, 1224 Valerian and Follo were made \\"in fellowship\\" from the Republic of Genoa.

Gameplay Initial press reactions to Impire drew comparisons with Bullfrog Productions's Dungeon Keeper, a real-time strategy game released in 1997 that received widespread critical acclaim. Alongside Dungeon Keeper, Impire similarly grants the player command over a subterranean empire, with the ability to construct buildings, recruit monsters, and engage minions in combat. Setting Within the fictional universe of Impire, the player assumes the persona of Ba øal-Abaddon, a primordial evil summoned from Tartarus and imprisoned in the physical form of a demonic imp, initially forced to serve the incompetent sorcerer Oscar van Fairweather. During the course of Impire, Baal-Abaddon escapes van Fairweather's control and attempts to reconstruct his ancient, nefarious empire under the continent of Ardania. Development Shortly after announcing the project on 26 July 2012, Yves Bordeleau, the Studio Director of Cyanide Montreal indicated that Impire was in 'pre-pre-alpha' during his presentation to GameSpot staff. Throughout Bordeleau's demonstration, he frequently referenced the 'scenarios' in the single-player and co-operative campaign setting of Impire, suggesting that the structure of the game is predominantly mission-based. Reception Impire holds a score of 45 on Metacritic (\\"generally unfavorable reviews\\"). Only one out of 28 examined reviews was favorable.
