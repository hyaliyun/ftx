He made his NRL debut in round 18 of the 2003 NRL season against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. In 2004, Stagg set a new record for tackles in a game, with 64 tackles made against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, this record has since been beaten. In 2006, Stagg made his representative debut, and played only one game for Queensland in State of Origin before being dropped. Later that year he played at centre in the Broncos 2006 NRL Grand Final victory. After winning the grand final with the Broncos, Stagg signed a two-year deal with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. In his first season at Canterbury, Stagg played 24 games as the club finished second on the table during the regular season. Stagg played for Canterbury in their preliminary final defeat against arch rivals Parramatta at Telstra Stadium. In 2010, he extended his contract with Canterbury-Bankstown until the end of 2012. In the 2012 NRL season, Stagg played 27 games as Canterbury won the Minor Premiership and reached the 2012 NRL Grand Final. Stagg played in Canterbury's 14‚Äì4 loss against Melbourne at ANZ Stadium.

It was New York's first state-run facility designed to care for the mentally ill, and one of the first such institutions in the United States. It was originally called the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica. The Greek Revival structure was designed by Captain William Clarke and its construction was funded by the state and by contributions from Utica residents. History The original plans for the hospital included four identical buildings, set at right angles to one another with a central courtyard. Due to a lack of funds, construction was halted after the first building was completed. This building (Old Main) stands over high, long, and nearly in depth. The six Greek style columns that decorate the front of Old Main stand at tall and each has an diameter. The hospital filled quickly and more beds were needed, so the building was enlarged by the addition of wings on either end. These wings opened in 1846, and in 1850, the accommodations were listed as: \\"380 single rooms for patients, 24 for their attendants, 20 dormitories each accommodating from 5 to 12 persons, 16 parlors or day rooms, 12 dining rooms, 24 bathing rooms, 24 closets and 24 water closets\\". The hospital's first director, Amariah Brigham, believed in \\"labor as the most essential of our curative means\\". Accordingly, patients were encouraged to participate in outdoor tasks, such as gardening, and handicrafts, such as needlework and carpentry. Brigham also introduced an annual fair at the hospital to display and sell items created by the patients. The first fair, in 1844, raised $200, which went toward an addition to the library, musical instruments, and a greenhouse. Some of the asylum inmates also printed a newsletter, called The Opal, which contained articles, poems, and drawings produced by the patients.Boudner, Karen, Christensen, Marvin, Daniels, Jill, Engall, Barbara, Harris, Nancy, Kotwal, Manek, M.D., Montague, Carolyn. \\"Utica State Hospital: 135 Years of Excellence.\\" Utica: Mohawk Valley Psychriatric Center, 1993. Print. In 1852, Old Main's first floor stairway caught fire. Patients and staff were safely evacuated, but a firefighter and doctor were killed while trying to salvage items from the building. The entire center portion of the building was destroyed. Four days after the fire at Old Main, a barn on the asylum grounds caught fire. William Spiers, a convicted arsonist, former patient, and sporadic employee, was arrested after admitting to setting both fires because he was angry with his supervisor. American Journal of Insanity In 1844, Brigham founded the first English language journal devoted to the subject of mental illness, American Journal of Insanity. Brigham was the editor-in-chief, and the journal was printed in the Utica State Hospital printing shop. After Brigham's death, the journal became the property of the hospital and in 1894, the American Medico-Psychological Association bought the journal for $994.50. The journal was later renamed the American Psychiatric Journal. Plaque on gateway pillar on Court Street Utica Crib Brigham disliked the then-current practice of using chains to restrain patients, and invented the \\"Utica Crib\\" as an alternative. The Utica Crib was an ordinary bed with a thick mattress on the bottom, slats on the sides, and a hinged top that could be locked from the outside. It was deep, long, and wide. Doctors used the Utica Crib to control and calm patients who were out of control. While use of the Utica Crib was widely criticized, some patients found it to have important therapeutic value. One patient who had slept in the Utica crib for several days commented that he had rested better and found it useful for \\"all crazy fellows as I, whose spirit is willing, but whose flesh is weak\\".Journal of Insanity October 1864 In the Edinburgh Medical Journal (February 1878), Dr. Lindsay and other physicians at the Murray Royal Institution at Perth recommended the Utica Crib. Lindsay stated that \\"the bed was practical and safe to patients.\\" However, Dr. Hammond and Dr. Mycert of the Utica State Hospital attacked the Utica Crib. Mycert stated that \\"the crib is at most barbarous and unscientific because there is already a tendency to determine the blood to the brain in excited forms of insanity which is released by the horizontal position in the crib and struggles the patient.\\" Mycert also compared the Utica Crib to a coffin. Hammond stated that sometimes patients died from being in the Utica Crib. Some of these deaths occurred when attendants thought the patients were out of control when, in fact, they were having a heart attack, a stroke, or some other type of serious health problem. On January 18, 1887, with the help of George Alder Blumer, all Utica Cribs were removed from the Utica State Hospital.

It is now an unoccupied, run-down building that is being used as a records archive for the New York State Office of Mental Health. Other, more modern, buildings on the large property are in use for psychiatric and other medical care.

Front: Joan Darling and Christine Matchett Arthur Edward Spence Hill (August 1, 1922 ‚Äì October 22, 2006) was a Canadian actor best known for appearances in British and American theatre, films, and television. He attended the University of British Columbia and continued his acting studies in Seattle, Washington. Early life and education Hill was born in Melfort, Saskatchewan, the son of Edith Georgina (Spence) and Olin Drake Hill, a lawyer. Hill served as a mechanic in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II and attended the University of British Columbia, where he studied law, but was lured to the stage. Career Hill made his Broadway debut as Cornelius Hackl in the 1957 revival of Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker. In 1963 he won the Tony Award for Best Dramatic Actor for his portrayal of George in the original Broadway production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (with Uta Hagen). His other Broadway credits include Ben Gant in the original production of Ketti Frings's Look Homeward, Angel (1957), All the Way Home (1960), Something More! (1964), and More Stately Mansions (1967). He played Dr. Jeremy Stone in the film adaptation of Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain (1971). Other film work included roles in The Ugly American (1963) with Marlon Brando, Harper (1966), Richard Lester's Petulia (1968) with George C. Scott, The Chairman (1969), Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (1975), Michael Crichton's Futureworld (1976), A Bridge Too Far (1977) (uncredited), and his narration on the film version of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983). Arguably, Hill's most famous acting role was that of lawyer Owen Marshall, the lead role in the 1971‚Äì74 TV series Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law. He appeared on many other series, including The Reporter, a 1964 drama starring Harry Guardino. He also played Grandpa Lansford Ingalls on Little House on the Prairie (1976). In 1966 he appeared as a special guest star in the Mission Impossible TV show episode \\"The Carriers\\" (S1:E10), in the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \\"The Monster from the Inferno\\"; in 1967 in the TV show The Invaders episode \\"The Leeches\\"; and was a guest star in the pilot episode of Murder, She Wrote in 1984, returning to that same role in an episode in 1990. The same year he played the governor of California in a Columbo episode, Agenda for Murder; this was his last onscreen role. Death Hill died in a Pacific Palisades, California, nursing home, aged 84, after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. His ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. He is survived by his second wife, son and stepdaughter. Hill and his first wife, Peggy (Hansard), were married 56 years before her death in 1998, also of Alzheimer's.

The underlying mechanism of these diseases are malfunctions in the ion channels in skeletal muscle cell membranes that allow electrically charged ions to leak in or out of the muscle cell, causing the cell to depolarize and become unable to move. The symptoms of periodic paralysis can also be caused by hyperthyroidism, and are then labeled thyrotoxic periodic paralysis; however, if this is the underlying condition there are likely to be other characteristic manifestations, enabling a correct diagnosis. Types Periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant myopathy with considerable variation in penetrance, leading to a spectrum of familial phenotypes (only one parent needs to carry the gene mutation to affect the children, but not all family members who share the gene are affected to the same degree). Specific diseases include: * Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (), where potassium leaks into the muscle cells from the bloodstream. * Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (), where potassium leaks out of the cells into the bloodstream. * Paramyotonia congenita (), a form which often accompanies hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, but may present alone. The primary symptom of paramyotonia congenita is muscle contracture which develops during exercise or activity. Paramyotonia congenita attacks may also be triggered by a low level of potassium in the bloodstream. This means people with both hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and paramyotonia congenita can have attacks with fluctuations of potassium up or down. * Andersen-Tawil syndrome (), a form of periodic paralysis that includes significant heart rhythm problems, fainting and risk of sudden death. Potassium levels may be low, high, or normal during attacks of ATS. Patients with ATS may also have skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis (curvature of the spine), webbing between the second and third toes or fingers (syndactyly), crooked fingers (clinodactyly), a small jaw (micrognathia) and low-set ears. Patients need to have another form of periodic paralysis to have the Andersen-Tawil. If a patient has hypo or hyper periodic paralysis they have a 50% chance of getting Andersen-Tawil. They just have to have the gene that causes it. This is a rare occurrence of having this. Only around 100 people in the world are recorded to have it. Cause One of the most common descriptions of periodic paralysis are episodic attacks of muscle weakness, which are commonly associated with serum potassium levels. Physical activity and diet content (carbohydrates) have been identified as PP triggers. Unlike non-dystrophic myotonias, the periodic paralysis phenotype is triggered after resting following exercise. Voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.4) mutations are among the key causes behind periodic paralysis. Hyper- kalemic PP (hyperPP) is identified with high extracellular potassium levels which are typically greater than 5 mM during attacks; however, HyperPP attacks can also take place without rise in potassium concentrations. HyperPP has a prevalence rate of 1/100,000. Patients become symptomatic around the age of 10. The weakness attacks in hyperPP are relatively short lasting, and range from minutes to hours. The attacks can happen upwards of ten times per month. Hypo-kalemic PP (hypoPP) is associated with low potassium levels. The onset of hypoPP occurs between the ages of 15 and 35. The prevalence of hypoPP is estimated to 1/100,000. HypoPP can be triggered by many external factors such as stress, high-sugar diet, and rest after exercise. During hypoPP attacks, the serum potassium concentrations can drop to less than 3 mM. Furthermore, hypoPP attacks are considerably longer lasting than hyperPP. As exercise is a trigger for periodic paralysis attacks, recently there is more research going into the physiological changes that accompany exercise including changes in blood pH.  Diagnosis  This disease is unusually difficult to diagnose. Patients often report years of wrong diagnosis and treatments that made them worse instead of better. Part of this may be that migraines are present in up to 50% of patients and can cause a confusing array of symptoms including headaches, speech difficulties and visual, auditory or sensory auras. DNA testing is available for only a half dozen common gene mutations, while dozens of known mutations are possible but are not routinely tested. Electromyography (EMG) findings are not specific but the McManis Protocol, also called the Compound Muscle Amplitude Potential test (CMAP) can be used by a skilled neurologist capable of utilizing the EMG, which can give assistance in diagnosing several of these PP disorders. The old glucose/insulin provocative testing can cause life-threatening symptoms and should not be used. Also of note is that potassium levels do not have to range outside of normal limits to cause serious, even life-threatening paralysis. These diseases are not the same as having a very low level of potassium (hypokalemia) or high potassium (hyperkalemia) and must not be treated as such. The total body store of potassium is usually normal; it is just in the wrong place.  Treatment  Treatment of the periodic paralyses may include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide, methazolamide or dichlorphenamide), taking supplemental oral potassium chloride and a potassium-sparing diuretic (for hypos) or avoiding potassium (for hypers), thiazide diuretics to increase the amount of potassium excreted by the kidneys (for hypers), and significant lifestyle changes including tightly controlled levels of exercise or activity. However, treatment should be tailored to the particular type of periodic paralysis. Treatment of periodic paralysis in Andersen-Tawil syndrome is similar to that for other types. However, pacemaker insertion or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be required to control cardiac symptoms.  Prognosis  While the disability can range from minor, occasional weakness to permanent muscle damage, inability to hold a normal job and use of a powerchair, most people function fairly well with drugs and lifestyle changes.

It is one of three Amaranthus species cultivated as a grain source, the other two being Amaranthus hypochondriacus and Amaranthus caudatus. In Mexico, it is called huautli ( and alegr√≠a ( and in English it has several common names, including blood amaranth, red amaranth, purple amaranth, prince's feather, and Mexican grain amaranth. In Maharashtra, it is called shravani maath (\\"‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§£‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§†\\") or rajgira (\\"‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ\\").

Description  Amaranthus cruentus is a tall annual herb topped with clusters of dark pink flowers. The plant can grow up to 2 m (6 ft) in height, and blooms in summer to fall. It is believed to have originated from Amaranthus hybridus, with which it shares many morphological features. The plant is usually green in color, but a purple variant was once grown for use in Inca rituals.  Uses  This species was in use as a food source in North America and Central America as early as 4000 BC. The seeds are eaten as a cereal grain. They are black in the wild plant, and white in the domesticated form. They are ground into flour, popped like popcorn, cooked into a porridge, or made into a confectionery called alegr√≠a. The leaves can be cooked like spinach, and the seeds can be germinated into nutritious sprouts. While A. cruentus is no longer a staple food in North and Central America, it is still grown and sold as a health food.

Ashtadiggajas is the collective title given to the eight Telugu scholars and poets in the court of Emperor Krishnadevaraya who ruled the Vijayanagara Empire from 1509 until his death in 1529. During his reign, Telugu literature and culture reached its zenith. In his court, eight poets were regarded as the eight pillars of his literary assembly. The age of Ashtadiggajas is called Prabandha Age (1540 AD to 1600). All of the Ashtadiggajas had composed at least one Prabandha Kavyamu and it was Ashtadiggajas who gave Prabandha its present form. Most of the Ashtadiggajas are from southern part of present-day Andhra Pradesh state (Rayalaseema) and Ashtadiggajas, Allasani Peddana, Dhurjati, Nandi Thimmana, Madayyagari Mallana and Ayyalaraju Ramabhadrudu are from the Rayalaseema. Tenali Ramakrishna hailed from the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Ramarajabhushanudu was another Ashtadiggaja. Etymology The title Ashtadiggajas (Ashta + dik + gaja) means elephants in eight directions. It refers to the old Hindu belief that eight elephants hold the earth in eight directions which are namely Airaavata, Pundareeka, Vamana, Kumuda, Anjana, Pushpadanta, Sarwabhouma, Suprateeka, whose wives are Abhra, Kapila, Pingala, Anupama, Taamraparni, Subhradanti, Angana, Anjanaavati. The court of poets were also called Bhuvana Vijayam (Conquest of the World).Legend in Vaishnavites about Eight elephants. One such mentioning of elephants is that Hiranayakasipu sent eight elephants carrying earth to kill Prahlada. Members These poets were : *Allasani Peddanna *Nandi Thimmana' *Madayyagari Mallana *Dhurjaty *Ayyalaraju Ramambhadrudu *Pingali Suranna *Ramarajabhushanudu *Tenali Ramakrishna The most famous being Lakshmi Kumara Thathachariar honoured with the title Andhrakavitapitamaha (Progenitor of Telugu poetry) and Tenali Ramakrishna, Krishnadevaraya's court jester who authored several acclaimed works.Like the Nine gems of King Vikramaditya's court, the Ashtadiggajas of Krishnadevara's court are famous in legend, K.A. Nilakanta Sastry, History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar, 1955, OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p372 More Details Though the above listed eight poets are widely regarded as the Ashtadiggajas, there are some differences of opinion as to who exactly constituted the Ashtadiggajas and if the composition of this body changed over time. Some literary works mention the name of Bhattu-Murti in place of Ramarajabhushanudu and some accounts mention Pingali Surana and Tenali Ramakrishna also as members of the later emperors. From the stone inscriptions of that time, it has been inferred that the village of Thippalur in the present-day Cuddapah district was given to the Ashtadiggajas by the emperor. Tenali Ramakrishna :(also known as Pandit Ramakrishna and Tenali Rama) was a poet, scholar, thinker and a Special Advisor in the court of Krishnadevaraya. He was a Telugu poet who hailed from what is now the Andhra Pradesh region, generally known for his wit and humour. He was one of the Ashtadiggajas or the eight poets at the court of Krishnadevaraya, the Vijayanagara emperor. When he was a child his father was led to death. So, to overcome the depression that Rama faced, his mother Lakshamma took him to Vijayanagara where he was an advisor and was also a great scholar of several languages that included Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi and Tamil. He was an advisor in court of Krishnadevaraya. Works Allasani Peddana wrote Swaarochisha Manu Sambhavam, dedicated to the Emperor Krishna Deva Raya. Nandi Thimmana wrote Parijataapaharanam and dedicated it to the emperor as well. Madayyagari Mallana wrote Rajasekhara Charitramu. Dhurjati wrote Kalahasti Mahatyamu. Ayyalaraju Ramabhadrudu wrote Ramaabhyudayamu. Pingali Surana wrote Raghavapandaveeyamu, a dual work that describes both Ramayana and Mahabharata. Ramarajabhushanudu wrote Kavyalankarasangrahamu, Vasucharitramu and Harischandranalopakhyanamu. Tenali Ramakrishna wrote Udbhataradhya Charitramu, Panduranga Mahatmyamu, and Ghatikachala Mahatmyamu. Literary style Telugu literature reached its peak during their period. A new style called prabandha with added fiction and few omissions from the original stories followed during this period. Poets in earlier century like Tikkana and Potana translated the Sanskrit books and epics without changing the stories from the original. Ashtadiggajas usually took small, sometimes obscure, stories from Puranas and used them as plots for writing major KƒÅvyas. A Prabandham can be of three types, viz., Prakhyatam, Utpadyam, Misramam (famous story, purely fictional story, mixed story). Ashtadiggajas have written in all the three genres during the Prabandha Yugam. There are also at least two dual meaning works during this time. Raghavapandaveeyam by Pingali Surana simultaneously runs the stories of Rama and Pandavas. Harischandranalopakhyanamu by Bhattumurthy also simultaneously tells the stories of the emperors Harischandra and Nala.

Cefepime has an extended spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with greater activity against both types of organism than third- generation agents. A 2007 meta-analysis suggested when data of trials were combined, mortality was increased in people treated with cefepime compared with other Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) performed their own meta-analysis which found no mortality difference. Cefepime was patented in 1982 by Bristol-Myers Squibb and approved for medical use in 1994. It is available as a generic drug and sold under a variety of trade names worldwide. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019.  Medical use  Cefepime is usually reserved to treat moderate to severe nosocomial pneumonia, infections caused by multiple drug-resistant microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. Cefepime has good activity against important pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. A particular strength is its activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by many plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta- lactamases, cefepime is stable and is a front-line agent when infection with Enterobacteriaceae is known or suspected. =Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility= Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic and has been used to treat bacteria responsible for causing pneumonia and infections of the skin and urinary tract. Some of these bacteria include Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Streptococcus species. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms:http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Cefepime.pdf * Escherichia coli: ‚â§0.007 ‚Äì 128 Œºg/ml * Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 0.06 ‚Äì >256 Œºg/ml * Streptococcus pneumoniae: ‚â§0.007 ‚Äì >8 Œºg/ml  Chemistry  The combination of the syn-configuration of the methoxyimino moiety and the aminothiazole moiety confers extra stability to Œ≤-lactamase enzymes produced by many bacteria. The N-methylpyrrolidine moiety increases penetration into Gram-negative bacteria. These factors increase the activity of cefepime against otherwise resistant organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Trade names Following expiration of the Bristol-Myers Squibb patent, cefepime became available as a generic and is now marketed by numerous companies worldwide under tradenames including Neopime (Neomed), Maxipime, Cepimax, Cepimex, and Axepim.

It is one of the most impressive castles in Germany and a symbol of the city. It was first mentioned in 1135. The Plassenberg family were ministerial of the counts of Andechs (later the dukes of Andechs-Meranien) and used as their seat the Plassenburg. The House of Guttenberg, a prominent Franconian noble family, traces its origins back to 1149 with a Gundeloh v. Blassenberg (Plassenberg). The name Guttenberg is derived from Guttenberg and was adopted by a Heinrich von Blassenberg around 1310. From 1340, the Hohenzollerns governed from Plassenburg castle their territories in Franconia till 1604. The Plassenburg was fortress and residence for the Hohenzollerns. It was destroyed in 1554 at the end of the second Margravian war (1552‚Äì1554) of margrave Albert Alcibiades. The Plassenburg was later rebuilt by the architect Caspar Vischer as an impressive stronghold and as a huge palace. In 1792, Margrave Alexander sold the Plassenburg to his cousin, the King of Prussia. A combined Bavarian and French army under the command of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, besieged the Plassenburg in 1806. In 1810, Kulmbach became Bavarian and the castle was used as a prison and as a military hospital. During the second world war, the Organisation Todt used the Plassenburg as a training camp and recreation home. Today, it is a museum and a venue for cultural events. It contains a significant collection of Prussian military artifacts and portraits.  History  Plassenburg Castle was first mentioned in 1135, when it was described by Count Berthold II of Andechs as comes de Plassenberch. Presumably he was also the founder of the castle, which was built to the west of an earlier fortified farmstead. To begin with, the castle was a central supporting stronghold for the Meranian rulers of the Upper Main and Franconian Forest. After the death of the last Andechs-Meranian, Duke Otto VIII, his brother-in-law divided his inheritance. Plassenburg Castle, along with Kulmbach, Berneck, Goldkronach, Wirsberg, Trebgast, and Pretzendorf (now Himmelkron) went to Hermann III and Otto III, the Counts of Weimar- Orlam√ºnde.q.v. List of noble families in Franconia. The two sons of Herman II (died 1247) and Beatrix of Andechs-Merania initially ruled together as \\"Lords of Plassenburg\\". After 1278 they divided the inheritance of their father, whereupon Otto III was given sole possession of the domain of Plassenburg and the territory around Weimar. Otto III died in 1285 and the Plassenburg appeared soon afterwards in the hands of his son Otto IV. His son in turn, Count Otto VI of Orlam√ºnde, who was the only Orlam√ºnde since 1323 who was described as \\"Lord of Plassenburg\\", pledged this lordship together with the Plassenburg, Kulmbach, Trebgast and Berneck in 1338 to Burgrave John II of Nuremberg. As a result, after Otto VI's death in 1340, Plassenburg fell to the Burgraves of Nuremberg from the House of Hohenzollern. Gradually, Plassenburg Castle developed into a new centre of power for the Hohenzollerns. At the time of Burgrave Frederick V of Nuremberg (who reigned 1357‚Äì1397), the Plassenburg had already outstripped the Cadolzburg - a traditional burgravial residence. In 1397 Burgrave Frederick V stepped down from the business of government and chose the Plassenburg as his retirement home. The Hohenzollerns' territory in Franconia was divided between his sons, John III and Frederick VI, later to be the Elector of Brandenburg, in accordance with the Dispositio Fridericiana of 1385. Thus, the Plassenburg became the centre of power for the so-called Principality of the Mountains (F√ºrstentum ob dem Gebirg), later the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. After the death of John III in 1420, his estate fell to his brother, Frederick, who, in 1421, created the office of \\"Captain of the Mountains\\" to rule his domain. Plassenburg remained the administrative centre of this hilly principality until after the middle of the 16th century. The imprisonment of the Countess Barbara of Brandenburg in March 1493, began the sad chapter of Plassenburg Castle as a family prison. This reached a peak in February 1515 when Margrave Casimir of Brandenburg-Kulmbach locked up his father, Margrave Frederick I of Brandenburg-Ansbach, in a tower room at Plassenburg from which he could not leave for 12 years. In 1542, Margrave Albert II of Brandenburg-Kulmbach moved the Residenz of the Margraves of Brandenburg-Kulmbach for the first time from Plassenburg, which continued to serve primarily as a country fortress to Bayreuth from then on.

James was the agent in Nassau, and William the agent in Liverpool. In early 1864, they contracted with Atlantans Richard Peters and Vernon Stevenson, and Richard Wilson to move cotton from the interior to the best remaining Confederate port at that time, Wilmington. Wilson negotiated sales to England for return cargoes of beef, pork and coffee as well as materials for the assembly of cotton bales (iron hoops and gunny cloth). During that time, the Captains were Englishman George M. Horner and Michael Philip Usina of Savannah and two steamers: Marie Celeste and Atlanta. First voyage was Usina on the new sidewheeler Marie Celeste from Wilmington to Bermuda with 1,000 bales of cotton. The Atlanta was completed in March 1864 and reached Bermuda in April and in the next three months made four trips to Wilmington, the last of which (with Captain Usina) was a close scrape with the Union blockade in which he was able to escape into the Cape Fear River and make his delivery. On June 20, 1864 both ships were at port in St. George, Bermuda. Marie Celeste left Bermuda on September 26, 1864 for Wilmington with a full cargo of canned meats but struck a reef and sank in 6 minutes.

He is first introduced as a major character in the novel In Search of the Castaways (1867‚Äì1868). He then reappears in a later novel, The Mysterious Island (1874), in which his fate, left unknown at the ending of the previous novel, is resolved, and during the course of which his character undergoes change and achieves a redemption. Biography =In Search of the Castaways= A Scottish able seaman, Ayrton served as quartermaster on board the three-mast ship Britannia, under the command of Captain Harry Grant. Differing opinions and extreme disputes with Grant led Ayrton to attempt leading a mutiny, the failure of which ended in his being expelled from the ship. Left behind alone on Australian shores, Ayrton learned nothing of the calamity that soon befell Grant's ship and crew. Teaming up with a band of escaped convicts, Ayrton began a life of crime around Australia, becoming a cunning highwayman and eventually a notorious gang leader under the name of Ben Joyce. Wishing to commandeer a swift ship in order to become a pirate leader as well, he took advantage of an opportunity supplied by the arrival of Lord Glenarvan's Scottish expedition searching for the castaways of the Britannia. Learning for the first time of the Britannias foundering, Ayrton tricked the searchers into a fraudulent wild goose chase for the alleged location of the shipwreck, while at the same time conspiring with his gangmates to ambush and delay the expedition while he made a grab for their own powerful ship, the Duncan. However, a prodigious set of circumstances resulted in his treacherous scheme backfiring, and in his falling into the hands of the searchers and facing harsh justice for his crimes. Being in the position to bargain for his fate, Ayrton arrived at a deal with Glenarvan, saying that in return for truthful information about the castaways he will not be delivered into the hands of English justice, but rather be marooned as a castaway on the desolate Tabor Island. While his information proved of no value to the searchers, the missing castaways were miraculously discovered on Tabor upon arrival there, and as the deal had to be respected, Ayrton took their place and was left there for an indefinite period so as to expiate for his crimes. =The Mysterious Island= Ayrton reappears in The Mysterious Island, after castaways living on Lincoln Island learn of an abandoned man's presence on the neighboring Tabor and set out to rescue him. Finding him, they discover that, having suffered solitude and remorse for long years, he has eventually lost his reason and has become brutish. Taken to Lincoln Island, his mental health is finally restored thanks to the colonists' care and friendship. He reluctantly joins their group, suffering great remorse and feeling he is unworthy of living among honest men. However, he proves his worth and redeems himself by working for the common good of the group, and finally by remaining steadfast and loyal to his new friends when facing the temptations of his past lifestyle, during a pirate attack on the island. Thus reformed, he later returns to society with his friends. In other media *Ayrton (here going by the forename \\"Thomas\\") is mentioned in the 1961 film Mysterious Island. Marooned by a group of pirates and his tongue cut out, he eked out a meager existence living in a cave on the island until he could no longer bear his desolation and hanged himself. His remains and the diary describing his story are found by the film's protagonists inside the cave three years later, in the year 1865, and his fate in the original novel (his degeneration \\"into animal savagery\\") is alluded to by war correspondent Spillit as he concocts a sensationalist article about Ayrton's fate on the fly. *In the Gainax anime Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, which borrows many elements of Jules Verne's stories (most notably, Captain Nemo and the Nautilus), Nadia and Jean encounter a man named Ayrton who is initially serving aboard the steam frigate USS Abraham Lincoln. It's not clear in what context Ayrton is serving but he claimed that he was investigating the alleged \\"sea monster\\" that turned out to be the Nautilus. He is next seen during the Island Episode arc of the series. Unlike in the Verne stories, Ayrton is depicted as an intelligent but \\"dorky\\" comedy relief character in the anime.

Specifically it is used to treat joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, sepsis, gonorrhea, and cellulitis. It is given either by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include nausea, allergic reactions, and inflammation at the site of injection. Another side effect may include Clostridium difficile diarrhea. It is not recommended in people who have had previous anaphylaxis to a penicillin. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is in the third-generation cephalosporin family of medications and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. Cefotaxime was discovered in 1976, and came into commercial use in 1980. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Medical uses It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Given its broad spectrum of activity, cefotaxime is used for a variety of infections, including: * Lower respiratory tract infections - e.g. pneumonia (most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae) * Genitourinary system infections - urinary tract infections (e.g. E. coli, S. epidermidis, P. mirabilis) and cervical/urethral gonorrhea * Gynecologic infections - e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and pelvic cellulitis * Sepsis - secondary to Streptococcus spp., S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. * Intra-abdominal infections - e.g. peritonitis * Bone and joint infections - S. aureus, Streptococcus spp. * CNS infections - e.g. meningitis/ventriculitis secondary to N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae Although cefotaxime has demonstrated efficacy in these infections, it is not necessarily considered to be the first-line agent. In meningitis, cefotaxime crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier better than cefuroxime. Vial of cefotaxime =Spectrum of activity= As a Œ≤-lactam antibiotic in the third- generation class of cephalosporins, cefotaxime is active against numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including several with resistance to classic Œ≤-lactams such as penicillin. These bacteria often manifest as infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin, central nervous system, bone, and intra-abdominal cavity. While regional susceptibilities must always be considered, cefotaxime typically is effective against these organisms (in addition to many others):U.S. Food and Drug Administration. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Claforan Sterile (cefotaxime for injection, USP) and Injection (cefotaxime injection, USP). 19 June 2009. * Staphylococcus aureus (not including MRSA) and S. epidermidis * Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes * Escherichia coli * Haemophilus influenzae * Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis * Klebsiella spp. * Burkholderia cepacia * Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris * Enterobacter spp. * Bacteroides spp. * Fusobacterium spp. Notable organisms against which cefotaxime is not active include Pseudomonas and Enterococcus. As listed, it has modest activity against the anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: * H. influenzae: ‚â§0.007 - 0.5 ¬µg/ml * S. aureus: 0.781 - 172 ¬µg/ml * S. pneumoniae: ‚â§0.007 Ôºç 8 ¬µg/ml http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Cefotaxime%20sodium%20USP.pdf Historically, cefotaxime has been considered to be comparable to ceftriaxone (another third- generation cephalosporin) in safety and efficacy for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, genitourinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, as well as prophylaxis for abdominal surgery. The majority of these infections are caused by organisms traditionally sensitive to both cephalosporins. However, ceftriaxone has the advantage of once-daily dosing, whereas the shorter half-life of cefotaxime necessitates two or three daily doses for efficacy. Changing patterns in microbial resistance suggest cefotaxime may be suffering greater resistance than ceftriaxone, whereas the two were previously considered comparable. Considering regional microbial sensitivities is also important when choosing any antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection. Adverse reactions Cefotaxime is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefotaxime or other cephalosporins. Caution should be used and risks weighed against potential benefits in patients with an allergy to penicillin, due to cross-reactivity between the classes. The most common adverse reactions experienced are: * Pain and inflammation at the site of injection/infusion (4.3%) * Rash, pruritus, or fever (2.4%) * Colitis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting (1.4%) Mechanism of action Cefotaxime is a Œ≤-lactam antibiotic (which refers to the structural components of the drug molecule itself). As a class, Œ≤-lactams inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) in the absence of cell wall assembly.Cefotaxime drug information Due to the mechanism of their attack on bacterial cell wall synthesis, Œ≤-lactams are considered to be bactericidal. Unlike Œ≤-lactams such as penicillin and amoxicillin, which are highly susceptible to degradation by Œ≤-lactamase enzymes (produced, for example, nearly universally by S. aureus), cefotaxime boasts the additional benefit of resistance to Œ≤-lactamase degradation due to the structural configuration of the cefotaxime molecule. The syn-configuration of the methoxyimino moiety confers stability against Œ≤-lactamases. Consequently, the spectrum of activity is broadened to include several Œ≤-lactamase-producing organisms (which would otherwise be resistant to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics), as outlined below. Cefotaxime, like other Œ≤-lactam antibiotics, does not only block the division of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but also the division of cyanelles, the photosynthetic organelles of the glaucophytes, and the division of chloroplasts of bryophytes. In contrast, it has no effect on the plastids of the highly developed vascular plants. This supports the endosymbiotic theory and indicates an evolution of plastid division in land plants. Administration Cefotaxime is administered by intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion. As cefotaxime is metabolized to both active and inactive metabolites by the liver and largely excreted in the urine, dose adjustments may be appropriate in people with renal or hepatic impairment. Plant tissue culture Cefotaxime is the only cephalosporin which has very low toxicity in plants, even at higher concentration (up to 500 mg/l). It is widely used to treat plant tissue infections with Gram-negative bacteria,cefotaxime for plant tissue culture while vancomycin is used to treat the plant tissue infections with Gram-positive bacteria.vancomycin for plant cell culture See also *Ceftazidime References External links * Cephalosporin antibiotics Thiazoles Ketoximes Acetate esters World Health Organization essential medicines Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Sanofi ","title":"Cefotaxime"},{"id":"2936437","text":"\\"The Ghost of the Grotto\\" is a 26-page Disney comics story written, drawn, and lettered by Carl Barks. It was first published in Donald Duck Four Color #159 (August 1947). Plot Donald Duck and his nephews have rented a boat in order to collect seaweed in the West Indies for money. When they get back on land in order to wait out the low tide so they can collect seaweed inside a grotto, the four hear that \\"tonight is the night\\". It turns out that the night is the night the ghost of the grotto kidnaps a little boy. With the ducks luck, Dewey is the one to be kidnapped. Now the ducks are faced with the task of saving Dewey and not only have to face the kidnapper, but an octopus guarding a giant ship. The ducks manage to get rid of the octopus by using a ton of pepper, while collecting a ton of seaweed in the process. Later, Donald uses a mouse named Montmorency to disarm the kidnapper. He is revealed to be the latest guardian of the treasure of Sir Francis Drake while Dewey was expected to succeed him. The story ends with the guardian being allowed to keep the treasure and spend it as he sees fit, which to him, is on fancy clothing and hamburgers. Development In a 1974 interview with Michael Barrier, Barks said, \\"I can remember the first idea I had on that was just trying to figure out something Donald could do. I thought of him sailing boats and came up with a potential ten pages of gathering seaweed, and selling this kelp, which would give me a lot of gags with boats. Like I told you before, I think of a scene, I mean a locale, and think, 'Well, I feel in the mood to draw boats, and the ocean, and so on,' and that would cause me to start working on that particular type of story. As I developed more and more things with the story, I think it's quite possible that that 'Ghost of the Grotto' was brought in as a menace. There is so much in that, I couldn't have thought of it in a whole bucketful of writing at once. It had to come out one thing after another.\\" See also *List of Disney comics by Carl Barks References External links * *The Ghost of the Grotto in Carl Barks guidebook Disney comics stories Donald Duck comics by Carl Barks 1947 in comics Ghosts in written fiction ","title":"The Ghost of the Grotto"},{"id":"2936441","text":"Pen-y-fan, , Pwllgwaelod and Cwm-yr-Eglwys An old picture postcard of Cwm-yr- Eglwys (c 1910) Cwm-yr-Eglwys (English: Valley of the Church) is a hamlet in a picturesque cove on the eastern side of the Dinas Island peninsula in the community of Dinas Cross between Fishguard and Newport, Pembrokeshire, in southwest Wales. It has a permanent population of four, with the remaining properties being holiday lets and caravans. Beach and facilities The beach has earned a Seaside Award and a Green Coast Award, similar to a Blue Flag beach award but for rural beaches with safe bathing. There is a narrow slipway for launching small boats, limited car parking (charges applies at certain times) and a public toilet. Dogs are allowed on the beach. Holiday cottage lettings are available. There is access to the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, which runs round to Pwllgwaelod, a cove on the opposite side of the peninsula. Alternatively, Pwllgwaelod may be reached via a purpose-built direct path through the wooded valley that almost divides Dinas Head from the mainland; being level, it is suitable for disabled access. Church of St. Brynach the Abbot The church of St. Brynach is on the site of an ancient llan, and the dedication is pre-Norman. The building suffered storm damage in 1850 and 1851 when the chancel was destroyed by the sea, the church footings left hanging over an abyss. The graveyard was severely damaged, the level being reduced by at least three feet, exposing human remains in large quantity. The great storm of October 1859 (the Royal Charter Storm) removed the church roof and damaged the walls. The building was abandoned immediately. In 1880, the remaining ruins were demolished apart from the west entrance wall. A new sea wall was built to protect what was left of the graveyard. In 1979, damage after another storm caused the sea wall to be repaired by Preseli District Council and the gravestones to be rearranged. The ruins of the church are now a popular tourist attraction and a pleasant public space. There is a scale model of a Cwm Trader by the gate. This is type of coastal trading vessel that would have plied these waters.Description from plaque placed by model Climate St Brynach's church prior to 1831. Painting by Henry Gastineau (1791‚Äì1876)Sheltered from prevailing winds, Cwm-yr-Eglwys has its own microclimate, being a few degrees warmer and drier than other parts of the Pembrokeshire coast. This allows the growth of trees and shrubs of almost Mediterranean luxuriance. Regatta A popular event every year, the Cwm-yr- Eglwys boat club reunites during the first two weeks of August for sailing events and regattas.

Plot Worried about earthquakes damaging his money bin, Scrooge McDuck is determined to find out what causes them. Upon a suggestion by Donald, Scrooge has a shaft dug beneath his money bin to search for faults which might get cracked open by a tremor, but the miners are suddenly frightened away by voices coming from a gigantic cave. The next day, Scrooge, Donald, and his three grandnephews find strangely round, colorful rocks scattered around the mineshaft. They prepare to descend, but all of a sudden their minecarts are sabotaged, stranding them deep beneath the ground. In the caverns below Duckburg, Scrooge and his nephews soon discover that the smooth \\"rocks\\" are really subterranean beings calling themselves Terries and Fermies who look like bowling balls with arms and a head, but no legs, and move around by rolling on the ground. The Terries and Fermies can hear radio broadcasts through certain magnetic rocks, which allowed them to learn English - with a southern accent - from listening to country music radio stations. Terries cause earthquakes by rolling in massive groups of thousands against the giant pillars that support the land on the surface of the Earth, while Fermies cause earthquakes by gathering together in massive numbers and lifting up pieces of the Earth's crust. They treat this as a sports competition: Whichever group causes the biggest earthquake (as revealed by intercepted radio transmissions) wins the contest and gets the prize, a piece of Ancient Greek pottery that fell down a crevice in Ancient Roman times in the year zero (i.e., the year 1 BCE translated into astronomical year numbering, which includes a year zero). However, now the Terries and Fermies have assembled for a large-scale bout which would result in Duckburg getting destroyed. In an attempt to stop the earthquakes, Scrooge steals the trophy, but is forced to discard his top hat during the subsequent escape. The Terries and Fermies pursue in an attempt to stop them, before they can tell the upper world of their existence and thus stall their competition. When that fails, they trigger a series of powerful tremors in order to shake the Ducks back down the shaft. This accidentally causes Scrooge's money bin to dislodge, slide across the shaft, and crack open, spilling all his money into the underground. However, since they think of money as worthless garbage (\\"We all know what the above-grounders think of money--they try to give it away on their radio quiz shows!\\"), the Terries and Fermies unite for a massive clean- up. Proclaiming Scrooge's hat as their new trophy, they push the money back into the money bin and then seal the shaft to prevent more money from getting dumped on them. The story ends with a professor visiting Scrooge to assure him that there will be no more quakes. But when Scrooge asks him what triggered the tremors, and the professor answers that it was \\"gas that builds up in fissures as the Earth shrinks\\", Scrooge slyly winks at his nephews with the words (in Southern accent) \\"He shore ain't been around, has he, podners?\\" Sequel Don Rosa wrote a sequel (of sorts) called The Universal Solvent.

The polyols are abbreviated as R-groups. Polyisocyanurate, also referred to as PIR, polyiso, or ISO, is a thermoset plastic typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation. The starting materials are similar to those used in polyurethane (PUR) except that the proportion of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is higher and a polyester-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a polyether polyol. The resulting chemical structure is significantly different, with the isocyanate groups on the MDI trimerising to form isocyanurate groups which the polyols link together, giving a complex polymeric structure.  Manufacturing  The reaction of MDI and polyol takes place at higher temperatures compared with the reaction temperature for the manufacture of PUR. At these elevated temperatures and in the presence of specific catalysts, MDI will first react with itself, producing a stiff, ring molecule, which is a reactive intermediate (a tri- isocyanate isocyanurate compound). Remaining MDI and the tri-isocyanate react with polyol to form a complex poly(urethane-isocyanurate) polymer (hence the use of the abbreviation PUI as an alternative to PIR), which is foamed in the presence of a suitable blowing agent. This isocyanurate polymer has a relatively strong molecular structure, because of the combination of strong chemical bonds, the ring structure of isocyanurate and high cross link density, each contributing to the greater stiffness than found in comparable polyurethanes. The greater bond strength also means these are more difficult to break, and as a result a PIR foam is chemically and thermally more stable: breakdown of isocyanurate bonds is reported to start above 200 ¬∞C, compared with urethane at 100 to 110 ¬∞C. PIR typically has an MDI/polyol ratio, also called its index (based on isocyanate/polyol stoichiometry to produce urethane alone), higher than 180. By comparison PUR indices are normally around 100. As the index increases material stiffness the brittleness also increases, although the correlation is not linear. Depending on the product application greater stiffness, chemical and/or thermal stability may be desirable. As such PIR manufacturers can offer multiple products with identical densities but different indices in an attempt to achieve optimal end use performance.  Uses  Polyisocyanurate insulation boards PIR is typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation. Its thermal conductivity has a typical value of 0.16 BTU¬∑in/(hr¬∑ft2¬∑¬∞F) (0.023 W/(m¬∑K)) depending on the perimeter:area ratio.Celotex GA4000 PIR specification PIR foam panels laminated with pure embossed aluminium foil are used for fabrication of pre- insulated duct that is used for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Prefabricated PIR sandwich panels are manufactured with corrosion- protected, corrugated steel facings bonded to a core of PIR foam and used extensively as roofing insulation and vertical walls (e.g. for warehousing, factories, office buildings etc.). Other typical uses for PIR foams include industrial and commercial pipe insulation, and carving/machining media (competing with expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane foams). Effectiveness of the insulation of a building envelope can be compromised by gaps resulting from shrinkage of individual panels. Manufacturing criteria require that shrinkage be limited to less than 1% (previously 2%). Even when shrinkage is limited to substantially less than this limit, the resulting gaps around the perimeter of each panel can reduce insulation effectiveness, especially if the panels are assumed to provide a vapor/infiltration barrier. Multiple layers with staggered joints, ship lapped or tongue & groove joints greatly reduce these problems.

A 2011 study of fire toxicity of insulating materials at the University of Central Lancashire's Centre for Fire and Hazard Science studied PIR and other commonly used materials under more realistic and wide-ranging conditions representative of a wider range of fire hazard, observing that most fire deaths resulted from toxic product inhalation. The study evaluated the degree to which toxic products were released, looking at toxicity, time-release profiles, and lethality of doses released, in a range of flaming, non-flaming, and poorly ventilated fires, and concluded that PIR generally released a considerably higher level of toxic products than the other insulating materials studied (PIR > PUR > EPS > PHF; glass and stone wools also studied).Assessment of the fire toxicity of building insulation materials - Stec & Hull, 2011; reported in Energy and Buildings jnl, 43 (2-3), pp. 498-506 (2011); doi:10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.015 In particular, hydrogen cyanide is recognised as a significant contributor to the fire toxicity of PIR (and PUR) foams.https://firesciencereviews.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40038-016-0012-3 The Fire Toxicity of Polyurethane Foams - McKenna and Hull 2016; Fire Science Reviews, 5:3, 2016; doi:10.1186/s40038-016-0012-3 Despite this PIR insulation is generally regarded as being more fire resistant than PUR insulation.

The Littlejohn adaptor was a device that could be added to the British QF 2 pounder (40 mm) anti-tank gun. It was used to extend the service life of the 2-pounder during the Second World War by converting it to squeeze bore operation. \\"Littlejohn\\" came from the calque, i.e. literal anglicization, of the name of Franti≈°ek Janeƒçek, the Czech designer and factory owner who had been working on the squeeze-bore principle in the 1930s and his son Franti≈°ek Karel Janeƒçek, who had brought his know-how to Britain after fleeing from German-occupied Czechoslovakia. Design At Bovington Tank Museum The adaptor took the form of a reducing bore that was screwed on to the end of the gun. This was coupled with a round formed from a hard core (tungsten) inside a softer metal casing - the armour-piercing, composite non-rigid (APCNR) design. Upon firing, the round travelled the first part of the bore as normal, but on entering the tapering portion the softer and malleable metal of the outer shell of the round was compressed - from 40 mm to approximately 30 mm. When the round emerged from the adaptor, it now had a smaller cross-section than before. Together with the higher driving pressure developed in a barrel of diminishing cross-section compared to a standard cylindrical bore, the APCNR round, called APSV (from armour-piercing super velocity), travelled faster, over a flatter trajectory. The Littlejohn adaptor/APCNR combination gave the 2 pounder a similar effect as the APDS round used with the much larger and heavier QF 6 pounder gun. The muzzle velocity of the APSV Mark II shell was 1,143 m/s compared with the 792 m/s of the normal 1.2 kg APCBC shell. The lighter Mark I APSV shell was capable of penetrating 88 mm of armour at 450 m at a 30-degree angle of impact.http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/sgun.htm Littlejohn adaptor In 1942, US Ordnance tested the Littlejohn adaptor in an attempt to develop a taper bore adaptor for the 37 mm Gun M3. The adaptor distorted after a few shots.Zaloga, Delf - US Anti-tank Artillery 1941-45, p 6-7.  Use  The adaptor was chiefly used on British armoured cars, e.g. the Daimler, which had been designed and built earlier in the war and could not be readily fitted with a larger gun. As an adaptor to the existing gun it could be removed so that normal rounds could be fired. This offered increased anti-armour effect but with obvious drawbacks in combat conditions. When crews discovered the special 'squeeze bore' ammunition was more effective than the standard 2pdr AT round even when not 'squeezed', the usual practice was to store the adaptors rather than have them fitted. It was also experimentally fitted to the Vickers 40mm S Gun fitted to the Hawker Hurricane IID anti-armour variant. As Anthony G Williams concludes in The Cartridge Researcher, the official bulletin of the European Cartridge Research Association (February 1999): the gun/ammunition combination did not function with sufficient reliability. The article goes on to state: Tests in the Far East showed a high level of accuracy, with an average of 25% of shots fired at tanks striking the target [but] attacks with HE were twice as accurate as with AP, possibly because the ballistics were a closer match to the .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns used for sighting See also *2.8 cm sPzB 41 ‚Äì German anti-tank gun working on the squeeze bore principle. *4.2 cm Pak 41 ‚Äì Most comparable German anti-tank gun working on the squeeze bore principle. *7.5 cm PaK 41 ‚Äì Another German anti-tank gun working on the squeeze bore principle.

It has been called \\"a San Gabriel Valley version of Watts Towers.\\" Rubel purchased a 1.7 acre citrus orchard on which the structure resides in 1959. He and his friends completed construction in 1986. Rubelia could be thought of as the first major recycling project in the United States. Rubel Castle was constructed partly out of concrete but also out of scrap steel, rocks, bedsprings, coat hangers, bottles, and other re-purposed materials that Rubel salvaged from the neighborhood as ranched and barns were giving way to tract houses. Background Michael Rubel on his porch, 2000. In 1959, Rubel bargained for the defunct Albourne Rancho property and took up residence in the huge citrus packing house. Rubel's father, Henry \\"Heinz\\" Scott Rubel, had been an Episcopal priest and gag writer for Joe Penner, the famous radio comedian and movie star. In the 1960s, Rubel's mother, one-time Broadway actress and Greenwich Village Follies dancer Dorothy Deuel Rubel, moved into the packing house with her son. At long it was the perfect venue for her favorite hobby: parties. Well-dressed guests arrived weekly by the hundreds, strolling past old tractors, horses, poultry, buggies, and the gritty accouterments of the bucolic rancho period, to arrive inside a tin fruit packing house transformed into a giant dance hall. Inside, surrounded by art and antique furniture remaining from Rubel ancestors, they mingled in the smudge oil and orange blossom atmosphere and danced to a small orchestra. Sally Rand, the silent screen actress and fan dancer, famous since the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, never missed Dorothy Rubel's parties, which were so extravagant that the packing house became known as ‚ÄúThe Tin Palace.‚Äù Other people of note who came to the Tin Palace in those days include Dwight Eisenhower, Vivian Duncan of the Duncan Sisters, Woody Strode, Beatrice Kay, Harry Townes, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Kid Chissell, Angie Dickinson, and Alfred Hitchcock. Fellow castle builder \\"Colonel\\" Jirayr Zorthian was a supporter and friend. Construction of the castle Though Rubel slept in one of the giant citrus refrigerators, the walls of thick cork were not sufficient sound insulation to allow him peace from his mother's parties. Beginning in 1968, Rubel began building a small get-away house in the empty old 1,000,000 gallon concrete reservoir, using cement and discarded champagne bottles.LA County Tax Assessor records indicate reservoir measures 124 feet in diameter, and a depth of 12 feet The walls of the reservoir provided privacy and a noise barrier while he built the bottle house. The project lasted twenty years, culminating in what is now called the Rubel Castle. With the encouragement of old timers like Odo B. Stade, and with the help of many friends and relations, the castle grew to be thousands of square feet with towers five stories high. Rubel and his associates built the structure without architectural plans, utilizing salvaged river rock, cement, steel, aluminum, telephone poles and wine bottles. Old motorcycles, tires, sand-filled rubber gloves, a camera, a golf club and a toaster are some of the items that protrude from the castle. A restored 1911 Seth Thomas clock works runs the brass bells and clock that crown one of the high towers, which is high. In the middle of the property sit a 1940s-era Santa Fe caboose, as well as old trucks and tractors. There is also a cemetery with rejected marble tombstones (but no graves). In addition, ‚Äúchickens are abundant and love this property as well as frequent animal visitors.‚ÄùLynda Siminske, ‚ÄúA Castle In Our Town...‚Äù, San Gabriel Valley Examiner, March 20‚Äì26, 2008, p. 1. Legacy Over the decades, Rubel Castle has instilled a work ethic in hundreds of young people and stands as a celebration of the independent spirit. Huell Howser interviewed Rubel for Videolog in 1990 and again in 2011.Glendora, CA - Huell Howser Videolog: Rubel's Castle Like a true castle, it has hosted royalty including Prince Philip. Some other notable guests have been Henry Kissinger, the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, and Governor George Deukmejian. In March 2005, Rubel donated the Castle to the Glendora Historical Society. Many television programs, music videos, and movies have been filmed on castle grounds, including NBC's Heroes and T-mobile's Frankenstein commercial. Rubel Castle was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

I. Gurdjieff. It is a diagram which better represents the place which Earth occupies in the Universe. The diagram has eight levels, each corresponding to Gurdjieff's Law of Octaves (see In Search of the Miraculous, chapter 7).Universal Octaves by G. I. Gurdjieff Levels The first level is \\"The Absolute\\", followed by \\"All Worlds\\", \\"All Suns\\", \\"Sun\\", \\"All Planets\\", \\"Earth\\", \\"Moon\\", and \\"The Absolute\\": * The heaviest/last level - \\"The Absolute\\" * Earth's satellite - \\"The Moon\\" * Our planet - \\"Earth\\" * All of the planets in the solar system to which Earth belongs to - \\"All Planets\\" * The planets belong to the \\"Sun\\" or the solar system * The Sun belongs to the Milky Way galaxy or the \\"All Suns\\" combined * All galaxies put together belong to \\"All Worlds\\" * All Worlds form a final whole called \\"The Absolute\\" This lineage indicates and compares the construction of all of the levels, matters, and laws of the Universe, placing them in scale with one another. Laws It was taught that in \\"The Absolute\\" the three holy forces form a whole, and thereby there is only one law (force) in the Absolute (which is the Will of the Absolute). The three forces of this law converge to form \\"All Worlds\\", whose level, now, being a part of the whole now has three laws. This level also having three forces, acts in creating \\"All Suns\\" in a similar process, and thereby \\"All Suns\\" has six laws (three new ones and three of the All Worlds level). Similarly, \\"Sun\\" has 12 laws, \\"All Planets\\" 24 laws, \\"Earth\\" 48 laws, \\"Moon\\" 96 laws, and \\"The Absolute\\" 192 laws. Each level after the Absolute has a bigger number of laws which govern it. Therefore, the further the level is away from the Absolute, the more mechanical the living things in it are. By this comparison it is claimed that there are 48 laws governing the life of living beings on Earth, thereby also claiming that the life on Earth is quite mechanical. Note that \\"the three holy forces\\" above, have manifestations in the physical universe as we know it today, such as are studies by physicists, other scientists. That is, aspects of \\"The Ray of Creation\\" as taught by Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and others, can be understood and described by modern science and scientists. Please also note that \\"The Absolute\\" mentioned here does not refer to God as it is normally understood or described by most humans. Matter Similarly to the difference of laws on each level, the level (in this case 'density') of matter differs in the same way. \\"The Absolute\\" has a matter density of one, \\"All Worlds\\" has a density of 3 (one atom of \\"All Worlds\\" has a three times the density as one atom of \\"The Absolute\\"), \\"All Suns\\" 6, \\"Sun\\" 12, \\"All Planets\\" 24, \\"Earth\\" 48, \\"Moon\\" 96, \\"The Absolute\\" (which in this case represents dead matter) 192. This way everything in the universe according to this cosmology is classified as matter. (Note that even the matter of density 12 is too rarefied for contemporary science to classify it as matter.) Higher bodies Gurdjieff's classification of Higher Bodies can be better represented on this scale. Physical body has the properties of the \\"Earth\\" level (that is, it has a density of 48 and it is subject to 48 laws). In comparison, a higher plane body would have a lighter density and it would be subject to a lesser number of laws (the amount varies on the level that the body falls under). Higher bodies placed in the Ray of Creation In the book Gnosis I, author Boris Mouravieff explains the names given to the notes of the solfege: *DOminus (God) *SIdereus orbis (Starry sky/Ensemble of all Worlds) *LActeus orbis (the Milky Way) *SOL (the Sun) *FAtum (Fate: the Planetary World, with direct influence on human destiny) *MIxtus orbis (the Earth, under the mixed rule of Good and Evil) *REgina astris (the Moon, ruler of human fate) The names of the notes have historically been attributed to the hymn 'Ut queant laxis' by Paulus Diaconus, where UT is used instead of DO. Mouravieff explains UT as indicating the uterus in the birth of flesh, and SI as representing \\"the door of the second Birth, according to the Spirit\\".Gnosis I, by Boris Mouravieff, Figure 37, Page 91 (pdf p116 of297) Other properties There are many other properties which can be displayed on the Ray of Creation such as: the evolution of the substances in the Universe, relationship between the cosmoses and the human body, etc. In a word, many of the properties of the laws of octaves could be displayed using the Ray of Creation. Some of the subtler properties of the law of octaves, and their effects, require that one have a knowledge of the laws of vibrations, and of involution and evolution, which knowledge today we call physics, acoustics, and music. Ray of Creation in history According to G. I. Gurdjieff, some of the ancient geocentric models don't represent an Earth-centered universe at all, but in reality display the Ray of Creation. This confusion was due to a lack of knowledge on the part of those examining the diagrams. Thus, the Ray of Creation is a part of ancient knowledge. It was also a part of modern knowledge, as shown by the fact that Gurdjieff learned it in Asia and the Middle-East, during the end of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. It became knowledge for us when he brought it to the West in the 20th century. At that time, it was noticed that fragments of this knowledge had been known from historical and ancient times.

The source of humor stems from the double meaning behind the phrase, although use of the name without prior knowledge of the joke could also be funny. Examples of the use of gag names occur in works of fiction in which there is a roll call, a listing of names, or a prank call. Some names that would be considered gag names have been adopted as stage names by performers, often in the adult entertainment industry. Examples =People= Occasionally, real people with a name that could be interpreted as a funny or vulgar phrase are subject to mockery or parody. For example, Hu Jintao, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, whose surname is pronounced like \\"who\\", and former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, whose surname is pronounced like \\"when\\", have occasionally been the topic of humor similar to the \\"Who's on First?\\" sketch. Former US Congressman from New Hampshire Dick Swett's name, when pronounced, sounds like common slang for male genital perspiration. Other names in politics which could be regarded as gag names include John Boehner, Harry Baals, Dick Armey, and Tiny Kox (although Boehner's surname is properly pronounced \\"bay-ner\\", it is often misunderstood as \\"boner\\"). There are also various people named Richard \\"Dick\\" Head. Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith released a brand of matches named Dickheads, modeled after established brand Redheads. Roller derby teams and players frequently use gag names. Often, these are double entendres or suggestive. For example, \\"Rocky Mountain Rollergirls\\" includes players named \\"Ho J. Simpson\\", \\"May Q. Pay\\" (\\"make you pay\\"), and \\"Amanda Jamitinya\\" (\\"a man to jam it in you\\"). Another well-known example was the Canadian Dick Assman, who received some public notoriety in 1995 for his name over the course of four months. He died in 2016. =Newspapers= On April 13, 2003, James Scott of the Charleston, South Carolina, paper The Post and Courier reported that \\"Heywood Jablome\\" (a pun for \\"Hey, would you blow me?\\", \\"blow\\" being slang for fellatio) was escorted from the premises while counterprotesting Martha Burk's protest at the Masters Tournament. He subsequently admitted to his being \\"duped\\" by the protester, who was in reality a morning disc jockey for a regional FM radio station. In 2014, Prior Lake High School students received a letter purportedly from the school district that described an upcoming \\"mandatory vagina inspection\\" for female students. The letter was signed \\"Barry McCockiner, Director, Department of Vaginal Corrections\\". The prank attracted worldwide attention and spawned copycat incidents at other schools around the country. =Radio= In 2007, a BBC radio presenter was reprimanded after tricking a fellow disc jockey into reading out a fake request for a listener named Connie Lingus (cunnilingus) from Ivan R.

In 2017, a taxi driver filmed protesting against changes to taxi licensing in Melbourne, Australia gave his name as \\"Tsim Booky\\" to the Channel 9 Today Show; tsimbouki (œÑœÉŒπŒºœÄŒøœçŒ∫Œπ) refers to fellatio in modern Greek.https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/wtf/crude-cabbie-gives-news- station-a-fake-and-rude-name-during-protest/news- story/7cdb1449c29a12c8025facee46b16ed4 =Internet= In 2016, Seattle resident Rudy Pantoja Jr. received widespread attention when, after a woman accosted him with a camera as he was leaving a Seattle City Council meeting, he gave his name as \\"Hugh Mungus\\" (humongous). Examples in fiction =Film= The series of James Bond books and films often use double entendres for the names of Bond girls, such as \\"Honey Rider\\" from Dr. No, \\"Bibi Dahl\\" from For Your Eyes Only, \\"Holly Goodhead\\" from Moonraker, \\"Xenia Onatopp\\" from GoldenEye, \\"Chu Mei\\" (chew me) from The Man with the Golden Gun, \\"Plenty O'Toole\\" from Diamonds Are Forever and, most famously, \\"Pussy Galore\\" from Goldfinger. This is parodied in the Austin Powers series of spoofs on the spy genre; Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery features a villain named \\"Alotta Fagina\\", who must repeat her name several times because Austin misunderstands it. Another example being a character from the animated Danish film Terkel in Trouble named \\"Dick Balsac\\". In Monty Python's Life of Brian, there is an extensive use of Dog Latin as a tool for creating gag names. The protagonist's biological father is believed to be called \\"Naughtius Maximus\\", while a friend of Pontius Pilate is named \\"Biggus Dickus\\" and his wife's name is \\"Incontinentia Buttocks\\". One of Pilate's guards also mentions \\"Sillius Soddus\\". The widely known gag name \\"Mike Hunt\\", a homonym for \\"my cunt\\", appears in the 1982 teen comedy film, Porky's, where a waitress receives a phone call and asks, \\"Is Mike Hunt here? Has anyone seen Mike Hunt?\\" (\\"Everybody in town!\\" replies a customer familiar with the gag). The 2019 film Hobbs & Shaw had Mike Oxmaul (my cock's small) and Hugh Janus (huge anus). =Television= In the American animated sitcom The Simpsons, Bart Simpson frequently calls Moe's Tavern asking for nonexistent patrons with gag names, prompting bartender Moe Szyslak to call out for the person. These gag names include, \\"Mike Rotch\\" (my crotch), \\"Seymour Butz\\" (see more butts), \\"Oliver Klozoff\\" (all of her clothes off), \\"Amanda Hugginkiss\\" (a man to hug and kiss), \\"Ollie Tabooger\\" (I'll eat a booger), and \\"Homer Sexual\\" (homosexual). This running joke is based on the real-life Tube Bar prank calls. However, in the episode \\"Flaming Moe's\\", this gag backfired against Bart when he called for a person named \\"Hugh Jass\\" (\\"huge ass\\") when it was revealed that there actually was a patron at Moe's Tavern named Hugh Jass. In the American animated television series South Park, the episode The Damned features Gerald Broflovski as \\"Skankhunt42\\" (skank cunt) trolling fictional Danish Olympic gold medalist and breast cancer survivor Freja Ollegard on live television by posting gag names such as \\"Dr. Juerdior Titsgo\\" (where'd your tits go?) and \\"Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff\\" (cuts your boobs off) on social media. In the MTV series Beavis and Butthead, the episode \\"Prank Call\\" features a random man named \\"Harry Sachz\\" (Hairy Sacks). The duo harasses him with prank phone calls until he snaps and hunts them down, inadvertently invading their neighbor Stuart's house instead. In the episode \\"Customers Suck\\", Butthead announces the name, \\"Seymour Butz\\" (without offering context). In the episode \\"Be All You Can Be\\", the duo meet Army Recruiter Dick Leakey and enlist under the names \\"Major Woody\\" and \\"Private Parts\\", with the promise of having them stationed at Fort Dix, with Butthead asking if it's near Fort Nuts. In the HBO series The Sopranos, Ralph Cifaretto makes a prank call to Paulie Gualtieri's mother, claiming to be \\"Detective Mike Hunt\\" with the Beaver Falls, PA Police Department. On the CBS series How I Met Your Mother, Ted (a university professor) laughed at a student's name, \\"Cook Pu\\" (\\"Cook Poo\\"), assuming it was a joke name. The offended student dropped his class. On the Tiny Toon Adventures pledge drive episode, Elmyra gets prank calls asking for \\"Bill Loney\\" (baloney), \\"Pepe Roni\\" (pepperoni) and \\"Ima Yutz\\" (I'm a yutz). The British sitcom The IT Crowd included a character named \\"Peter File\\" (paedophile) in a 2007 episode titled \\"The Dinner Party\\". The British satirist and writer Chris Morris makes use of silly names in the television programmes Brass Eye, The Day Today and his radio series On The Hour, such as \\"David Qunt\\" and \\"Wayne Carr\\" (a homophone for \\"wanker\\"). Robert De Niro has appeared in various episodes of Saturday Night Live as a homeland security officer advising the public to be on the lookout for suspects such as \\"Jenna Tailia\\" (genitalia), \\"M'Balz es-Hari\\" (my balls is hairy) and \\"Graabir Boubi\\" (grab her booby). The mass media have featured gag names that sound like vulgar sexual terms for vaginas (\\"Mike Hunt\\"), penises (\\"Dick Head\\", \\"Dikshit\\"India condemns 'racist' remarks by New Zealand TV host, BBC News, 7 October 2010.), testicles (\\"Harry Balls\\"), and sexual intercourse (with homonyms for \\"fucking\\"). Gag names can also be applied to businesses, such as Howard Stern's use of the fictitious \\"Sofa King\\": in a hoax advertisement, the store was described as being \\"Sofa King great\\" (i.e. \\"so fucking great\\"). A January 18, 2000, FCC complaint about using the phrase was dismissed. A similar sketch was performed on Saturday Night Live in early 2007, portraying Sofa King as a new store opening after the success of Mattress King. An old joke (1950s) said that the Fuller Brush Company had merged with the Schick company to become the \\"Fuller Schick\\" company. =Other= Shenzhen's KK100 building used to be known as the Kingkey (a near homophone of \\"kinky\\") 100 and Kingkey Finance Tower. The Frank Zappa album Sheik Yerbouti (\\"shake your booty\\"), emphasized the comedic aspect of his lyrics more than ever before. Examples in other languages The 2005 South Korean television series Hello My Teacher was criticised for its inclusion of a character with the gag name \\"Nam Sung-ki\\". \\"Sung-ki\\" is a common masculine name, but \\"Nam Sung-ki\\" is homophonous with the Korean language word for \\"penis\\". =Israeli Hebrew= Ghil'ad Zuckermann suggests that at the end of the twentieth century there was a wave of jocular Israeli gag names, most of them based on rebracketing.See p. 146 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew.

The Pont Alexandre III is a deck arch bridge that spans the Seine in Paris. It connects the Champs-√âlys√©es quarter with those of the Invalides and Eiffel Tower. The bridge is widely regarded as the most ornate, extravagant bridge in the city. It has been classified as a French monument historique since 1975. Pont Alexandre III History The Beaux-Arts style bridge, with its exuberant Art Nouveau lamps, cherubs, nymphs and winged horses at either end, was built between 1896 and 1900. It is named after Tsar Alexander III, who had concluded the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892. His son Nicholas II laid the foundation stone in October 1896. The style of the bridge reflects that of the Grand Palais, to which it leads on the right bank. The construction of the bridge is a marvel of 19th century engineering, consisting of a high single span steel arch. The design, by the architects and Gaston Cousin, was constrained by the need to keep the bridge from obscuring the view of the Champs-√âlys√©es or the Invalides. The bridge was built by the engineers Jean R√©sal and . It was inaugurated in 1900 for the Exposition Universelle (universal exhibition) World's Fair, as were the nearby Grand Palais and Petit Palais. Sculptures Fames sculptures on the socle counterweights. Nymphs of the Neva relief. Twilight view, looking toward the d√¥me of Les Invalides Numerous sculptors provided the sculptures that feature prominently on the bridge. =Fames= Four gilt-bronze statues of Fames watch over the bridge, supported on massive masonry socles, that provide stabilizing counterweight for the arch, without interfering with monumental views. The socles are crowned by Fames restraining Pegasus. :*On the Right Bank: Renomm√©e des Sciences (\\"Fame of the Sciences\\") and the Renomm√©e des Arts (\\"Fame of the Arts\\"), both by Emmanuel Fr√©miet.

They are both are executed in hammered copper over forms by Georges R√©cipon. In the same political spirit, the Trinity Bridge in Saint Petersburg was conceived as a memorial to the Franco-Russian Alliance. It was designed by Gustave Eiffel, and the first stone was laid in August 1897 by French president F√©lix Faure.

In the insurance industry, \\"replacement cost\\" or \\"replacement cost value\\" is one of several method of determining the value of an insured item. Replacement cost is the actual cost to replace an item or structure at its pre-loss condition. This may not be the \\"market value\\" of the item, and is typically distinguished from the \\"actual cash value\\" payment which includes a deduction for depreciation. For insurance policies for property insurance, a contractual stipulation that the lost asset must be actually repaired or replaced before the replacement cost can be paid is common. This prevents overinsurance, which contributes to arson and insurance fraud.Thomas JE, Wilson B. (2005). The Indemnity Principle: Evolution from a Financial to a Functional Paradigm]. Journal of Risk Management & Insurance. Free full-text. Replacement cost policies emerged in the mid-20th century; prior to that concern about overinsurance restricted their availability. If insurance carriers honestly determine replacement cost, it becomes a \\"win-win\\" for both for the carriers and the customers. However, when a replacement cost determination is made by the carrier (and, perhaps, its third party expert) that exceeds the actual cost of replacement, the customer is likely to be paying for more insurance than necessary. To the extent that the carrier has knowingly or carelessly sold excessive (i.e. unnecessary) insurance, such a practice may constitute consumer fraud. Replacement cost coverage is designed so the policy holder will not have to spend more money to get a similar new item and that the insurance company does not pay for intangibles. For example: when a television is covered by a replacement cost value policy, the cost of a similar television which can be purchased today determines the compensation amount for that item. This kind of policy is more expensive than an Actual Cash Value policy, where the policyholder will not be compensated for the depreciation of an item that was destroyed. The total amount paid by an insurance company on a claim may also involve other factors such as co- insurance or deductibles. One of the champions of the replacement cost method was the Dutch professor in Business economics Th√©odore Limperg.  Vendors  Insurers purchase estimations on replacement cost. Major estimation companies include CoreLogic subsidiary Marshall Swift-Boeckh, Verisk Analytics PropertyProfile, Bluebook International, and E2Value. Consumer-focused tools include AccuCoverage and Home Smart Reports.  Home insurance in the United States  If insufficient coverage is purchased to rebuild the home, the insured may have to pay substantial uninsured costs out of their own pocket. In 2013, a survey found that about 60% of homes have replacement cost estimates which are too low by an estimated 17 percent. In some cases, estimates can be too low because of \\"demand surge\\" after a catastrophe.Covered by homeowners insurance? Don't be so sure. CNN Money. WebCite archive. Historically, consumers could purchase \\"guaranteed replacement cost\\" coverage which ensure sufficient limits if the estimate was too low, but these became \\"virtually extinct\\" after several California disasters including the Oakland firestorm of 1991, the Laguna Beach fires, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. = Underinsurance responsibility = Although insurance is decided at the state-level, most states follow similar practices. In CaliforniaGibson v. Geico (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 441, 447., as cited by Silvia San Nicolas. and Texas, the insured is responsible for determining the proper amount of insurance. However, one survey found that about half of consumers believe it is insurer's responsibility, and consumers may come to this conclusion through the insurer's processes, which one legal scholar argues creates a \\"reasonable expectation\\" of coverage, which is a controversial insurance law doctrine adopted in certain states. In California, the 2007 case on the issue, Everett vs. State Farm General Insurance Company, provoked an unsuccessful request by the California Department of Insurance and insurance nonprofit United Policyholders to depublish the case.

In his capacity as president, he chairs the parliament‚Äôs Council of Elders, which ‚Äì among other duties ‚Äì determines daily legislative agenda items and assigning committee chairpersons based on party representation. In the negotiations to form a Grand Coalition of the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian CSU) and the SPD following the 2013 federal elections, Lammert was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on cultural and media affairs, led by Michael Kretschmer and Klaus Wowereit.

In November 2013 the university finished a thorough investigation and came to the conclusion that, although the dissertation contained \\"avoidable shortcomings in the citations\\", those did not constitute plagiarism.

The gunman, 14-year-old Barry Dale Loukaitis (; born February 26, 1981), killed his algebra teacher and two students, and held his classmates hostage before a gym coach subdued him. Shooting On the day of the shooting, Loukaitis was dressed as a Wild West-style gunslinger and was wearing a black duster. He was armed with a .30‚Äì30 caliber hunting rifle and two handguns (.357 caliber revolver and .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol) that belonged to his father, and was carrying approximately 200 rounds of ammunition. Loukaitis walked from his house to his school, where he had entered his algebra classroom during fifth period. He opened fire at students, killing two, Arnold Fritz and Manuel Vela, Jr., both fourteen. Another student, 13-year-old Natalie Hintz, sustained critical gunshot wounds to the right arm and abdomen, and was airlifted to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Loukaitis then fatally shot his algebra teacher Leona Caires in the chest.\\" Teacher and coach Jon Lane entered the classroom upon hearing the gunshots to find Loukaitis holding his classmates hostage. He planned to use one hostage so he could safely exit the school. Lane volunteered as the hostage, and Loukaitis kept him at gunpoint with his rifle. Lane then grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis and wrestled him to the ground, later assisting in the evacuation of students. Lane kept Loukaitis subdued until police arrived at the scene. Perpetrator and motives In the year prior to the shooting, the Loukaitis family was facing various dysfunctional issues. Loukaitis' parents separated in 1995, after his mother discovered her husband was having an affair. She filed for divorce against her husband in January 1996. His mother, Jo Ann Phillips, was a domineering woman who became increasingly distant and began speaking of suicide. She would frequently imply that her son Barry would also have to kill himself, and that the date of the double-suicide would be on Valentine's Day of 1996. Barry talked his mother out of doing so, by having her write down her feelings. = Mental illness = Psychologists hired by the defense believed Loukaitis suffered from either depression or bipolar disorder, while prosecution witness Dr. Alan Unis, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington, diagnosed him with dysthymic disorder. Loukaitis suffered from hyperactivity, and was taking Ritalin at the time of the shooting. He also suffered from clinical depression, a mental illness present in the last three generations of the Loukaitis family, and last four generations of the Phillips family. Loukaitis claimed that he only intended on killing Manuel Vela, and that the other deaths were accidental. Trial In June 1996, the Spokane Court of Appeals were to come to a decision whether 15-year-old Barry Loukaitis should be tried as an adult or juvenile. On July 2, three members of the Spokane Court of Appeals convinced Judge Evan Sperline to allow court-appointed psychiatrist Joan Petrich to present a testimony based on Loukaitis' mental health. The trial was later moved to Seattle, Washington due to media publicity. Loukaitis had pleaded insanity on all charges against him, and claimed that \\"mood swings\\" were the cause of his violent actions. During his trial, Joan Petrich testified that Loukaitis had been experiencing delusional and messianic thoughts before the shooting. He had stated, \\"He felt like he was God and would laugh to himself. He felt he was superior to other people, and then those feelings were later replaced by hate, disdain, and not measuring up.\\" Prosecutors Donna Wise and John Knodell argued that Loukaitis had carefully planned the shooting, getting ideas from the Pearl Jam song \\"Jeremy\\". The music video from \\"Jeremy\\" shows a troubled youth committing suicide in front of his teacher and classmates, although it was largely believed that \\"Jeremy\\" had opened fire on the class. This has been widely misunderstood because MTV had strong anti-violence imagery rules. The original video showed the child putting the gun into his mouth, however the only images allowed to air were those of the children covered in his blood. Prosecution also said that he had gotten ideas from the Stephen King novel Rage and the films Natural Born Killers and The Basketball Diaries. Loukaitis has also stated that he tried to model his life after the novel Rages protagonist Charlie Decker, who kills two teachers and takes his algebra class hostage. On September 24, 1997, Loukaitis was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder, one count of first-degree attempted murder, and 16 counts of aggravated kidnapping. He was sentenced to serve two life sentences and an additional 205 years without the possibility of parole. He is currently imprisoned at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center in Washington State. The Washington State Court of Appeals denied Loukaitis's request for a new trial in 1999. = Re-sentencing = The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that people convicted of murder they committed under 18 years of age could not receive automatic life terms without parole and in 2016 the court ruled that the policy also apply retroactively. Loukaitis was heard for a re-sentencing in 2017, during which he apologized for the first time, in a letter to the Grant County Superior Court. He was re-sentenced to 189 years in prison.

The Wah Ching has been involved in crimes including narcotic sales, racketeering and gambling. History Wah Ching is composed mainly of young men. Triad member clothing ranges from casual to business attire making it hard for officials to distinguish them from other citizens. The Wah Ching was founded mainly by immigrants from Taiwan and Hong Kong who were fleeing communist China. As a result, the Wah Ching was first founded as a political activist group that avidly opposed the communist regime in China. However, as time progressed, the Wah Ching quickly became a street gang through Tong affiliations but still kept their nationalist political views. Wah Ching first received widespread media attention because of the 1977 Golden Dragon Massacre (GDM) involving another Chinese gang, the Chung Ching Yee Joe Boys (JBS). The event took place at the Golden Dragon Restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown. Five people were killed, and eleven others were injured. None of the victims were gang members. Five Joe Boys members were convicted of the shooting. The cause of the attack was vandalism by Wah Ching to the graves of several Joe Boy members and a shootout that took place a few months earlier that left one Joe Boy dead and two others wounded.Make First Arrest in Golden Dragon Massacre of 1977, UPI, March 24, 1978. After the shootout occurred, the Wah Ching, though none of them had been killed or even injured in the attack, still killed several Joe Boys in retaliation. In 1991, Danny \\"Ah Pai\\" Wong, the leader of Wah Ching, was shot and killed by Wo Hop To (WHT) hitmen. After the murder, most of the Wah Ching began working with the Wo Hop To. After law enforcement cracked down on the Wo Hop To around 1992, former Wah Ching members who had defected to the Wo Hop To founded the Jackson Street Boys, a gang based in San Francisco's Chinatown which resumed what a SFPD officer described in 2000 as \\"the same stuff on a smaller scale and without the same visibility\\", including extortion of local merchants and operating gambling dens. In the mid-1990s, the Wah Ching was reported as being engaged in murder, extortion, drug trafficking and gambling, and expanded into software bootlegging. The Wah Ching Gang has an ongoing conflict with another rival Asian gang in Los Angeles, the Asian Boyz (ABZ), who also aligned themselves with the Vietnamese Boyz (VBZ) in opposition to Wah Ching. Wah Ching's move from its original home in the Bay Area to Southern California is probably one of the sources of the disputes over gang turf. Over the decades, the Wah Ching has evolved from a street gang to an organized crime group, however, due to the fact that a lot of the Wah Ching's criminal activity and murders have been motivated by political agendas, some agencies have classified the Wah Ching as a political terrorist organization. There is law enforcement anecdotal evidence that suggests as a group the gang has developed strong associations with other Asian organized crime groups, such as the Wo Hop To and 14K Triads in Hong Kong. Currently, the gang have shown signs of mixed ideology. Despite the fact that Wah Ching in Chinese literally means \\"Chinese Youth\\", there are still some individuals of non-Chinese descent who claim Wah Ching. The gang now consists of a large number of Vietnamese, Japanese, and Hmong members. The same applies with their rivals, the Vietnamese Boyz, who have a great number of Chinese members. Notable incidents The Wah Ching has been in a long conflict with the Asian Boyz. One of the first shootouts between the two gangs occurred in the 1990s. The shooting occurred in El Monte at a pool hall. An Asian Boyz gang member, Lea Mek, was killed by Wah Ching gang member Chieu Luong Yang. Another shootout between the two gangs occurred in San Marino that led to the deaths of two youths at a San Marino High School graduation party in June. After an investigation by the authorities, police claimed that when the Asian Boyz gang members arrived to the party, they saw that Wah Ching gang members were there, so they left and came back later with weapons to open fire on the latter. Over nine gang members were arrested. Police searched the homes of the gang members and seized five weapons. The shootouts between the two gangs were called \\"Summer Madness\\" by the Asian Boyz gang and resulted in at least 42 deaths on both sides. in 2001, a 17‚Äìyear‚Äìold Wah Ching member, who was an advanced placement student at Diamond Bar High School, shot and killed two members of the rival San Gabriel Killas (SGK) while attending a football game. On December 2005, a 20 year old Wah Ching member murdered a Chicano man with unknown gang affiliation by running over him with a car in front of his house. He repeatedly backed over the man with the car while holding down the car's horn to ensure that neighbors in the area saw the act. On June 2, 2007, Anh Duoc Nguyen, a member of Monterey Park-Side Wah Ching shot at five people in Westminster's Bowling Green Park, severely injuring one. The shootout was believed to be motivated by the fact that one of the victims changed his Myspace page bio to read \\"garden gang\\". Sometime in 2009, a 14 year old member of Ocean-Side Wah Ching got into an argument with members of a rival Hispanic gang. During the argument, police report that one of the Hispanic gang members called the Asian teen a \\"Chink\\", and told him to \\"Go back to China\\". The Wah Ching gangster responded to the racial slur by pulling out a .45 caliber pistol and shooting the rival gang member. Organization The Wah Ching's main structure consists of one main boss under the union and various factions called sides who have leaders or lung tao ('dragon heads') who work together to organize their syndicates with the sole purpose of making money. The number of members in each side can vary anywhere from a few dozen to a couple thousand, and the total number of sides is believed to be around 10. =Southern California sides= *Joe Young - known as small plum moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles and founded wah Ching in the Los Angeles area.

The four original sides, Ken-Side, Paul- Side, T-Side, and Sonny-Side, have a close relationship with one another and high-ranking members. =Known Northern California sides= *510-side (EO-23) ‚Äì Located in East Oakland, this side was founded by OG members of Wah Ching, and some Hop Sing Boys. The gang became infamous for its ruthlessness after requiring newly initiated members to \\"23-mark\\" a rival gang member. This initiation required one to beat a rival gang member either to death or to the point of unconsciousness, then to take a knife and carve a phrase such as \\"Wah Ching\\" or \\"Property of EO-23\\" onto the victims chest or forehead. *Jackson- Side (Insane-Side Dragon Tribe/Tokyo Boyz/JS-23) ‚Äì Founded by members of Alhambra-Side and Monterey Park-Side who went back to San Francisco to reestablish the gang's presence. When it was founded, Jackson-Side had no more than 100 members. However, shortly after it was founded, Jackson-Side merged with a local Japanese-American street gang known as Tokyo Boyz and after a few years, Jackson-Side grew to over 1,000 members. Recently, Jackson-Side Wah Ching has been more commonly known as Insane-Side Wah Ching, due to the Wah Ching's rivalry with the similarly named Jackson Street Boys as well as the gang's habit for gruesome crimes such as 23-marking. Jackson-Side Wah Ching gang members are also recognized Chinese Playground Boys. *70-Side (X7-23) ‚Äì A defunct side of the Wah Ching that was located on Alameda Island References External links * Reference to pool hall shooting * https://web.archive.org/web/20070124185611/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pr2002/013.html * http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-notorious-gangs_8.html * http://www.streetgangs.com/billboard/viewtopic.php?t=2585 * http://www.brockmorris.com/btigers/ * https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Chinatown-gang-feud-ignited-one-of- SF-s-worst-8348992.php * https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long- reads/article/2111953/life-and-violent-death-chinatown-hong-kong-born * https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147409NCJRS.pdf * https://www.nytimes.com/1977/09/12/archives/san-francisco-ambush-called- chinese-gang-revenge.html * https://www.whittierdailynews.com/2010/09/22/18-arrested-in-operation- targeting-san-gabriel-valley-asian-gang/ Chinatown, San Francisco Chinese-American organized crime groups Gangs in San Francisco Gangs in Nevada Gangs in Los Angeles Gangs in California ","title":"Wah Ching"},{"id":"2936667","text":"Oasis of the Zombies (originally called L'Ab√Æme des Morts-Vivants / The Abyss of the Living Dead) is a 1982 film directed by Jes√∫s Franco for French producer Marius Lesoeur.

Water is abstracted from the river at the Sihlsee, leading to decreased downstream water flows and a consequent reduction in water quality. The river flows through, or along the border of, the cantons of Schwyz, Z√ºrich and Zug. The main settlements of the Sihl Valley are all in the canton of Z√ºrich, and include the towns of Langnau am Albis and Adliswil, along with a south-western segment of the city of Z√ºrich. Above Langnau am Albis, some from the confluence with the Limmat, there are no major settlements alongside the river, and only a few small villages. Whilst the town of Einsiedeln is situated close to the Sihlsee, it is actually in the valley of a tributary river, the Alp. Etymology The first written reference to the name dates to 1018, in the form Sylaha.B. Dittli, Orts- und Flurnamen im Kt. Zug, 1992, 52-54 The name may be of Old European or Celtic origin: *S√Æla (\\"quiet watercourse\\", from a root *s√Æl = \\"to trickle, wet\\") > Romance Sila with the addition of the Old High German element aha \\"flowing water\\". Course of the river The Sihlsee, the upper valley of the Sihl, and the Druesberg mountain The river rises to the north-eastern side of the Druesberg mountain, in the municipality of Unteriberg of the canton of Schwyz, and flows north to the village of Studen. Some downstream of Studen, the river enters the artificial Sihlsee reservoir at its southern end. Nearby, the Minster also flows into the Sihlsee, and was, prior to construction of the reservoir, a direct tributary of the Sihl. The Eubach, Rickentalbach and Grossbach tributary streams also flow into the Sihl via the Sihlsee. The Sihlsee is some long, and lies close to the town of Einsiedeln. It is Switzerland's largest artificial lake, and is impounded by a high dam. Electricity is generated by diverting water down a tunnel from the Sihlsee, which has a water level elevation of , through the Etzelwerk hydroelectric power station at Altendorf, into Lake Z√ºrich, which has a water level elevation of . This has led to decreased water flows downstream of the dam, with negative impact on water quality and a tendency for the river to dry out in places during low flow conditions in winter. The Sihlsprung rapids Below the dam, the Sihl enters a narrow glacial valley and continues in an easterly direction, receiving the water of its tributary the Alp, before briefly entering the canton of Z√ºrich near the village of H√ºtten. The river then continues as the border between the cantons of Zug and Z√ºrich, passing through the Sihlsprung rapids along the way. At the village of Sihlbrugg, the river enters the canton of Z√ºrich for a second and final time. North of Sihlbrugg, the river flows through a lightly populated and heavily wooded valley, accompanied by a main road and railway line. The Sihlwald forest, a rare example of a large-scale and original forest, lies on the slopes of the Albis that rise up from the river to the west. At this point, Lake Z√ºrich lies only to the east, but is separated from the river by the Zimmerberg mountain. Reaching the town of Langnau am Albis, on the west bank of the river, and the village of Gattikon, on the east bank, the valley becomes more populous and industrial, with industry originally attracted by the available water power. From here the valley bottom is continuously built- up through the town of Adliswil to the boundary of the city of Z√ºrich. Once in the city, the river flows through and between the Leimbach, Wollishofen, Friesenberg, Alt-Wiedikon and Enge quarters before reaching the city centre. In this stretch the river is crossed by many bridges, and for one stretch the A3 motorway runs along and over the river on a viaduct. The Sihl as a route for a motorway Nearer the city centre, the SZU railway line runs in tunnel along and under the river. One access to that line's Selnau station is constructed in the form of an artificial island within the river. Just downstream of here, the Schanzengraben moat, which is fed from Lake Z√ºrich and formerly protected the western perimeter of the Altstadt, flows into the Sihl, just before the latter flows under Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof railway station. The station has platforms on two levels, and the river actually tunnels under the upper ones, but above the lower ones, in 5 culverts each with a length of and a clear opening of by . Shortly after passing under the station, the Sihl joins the Limmat at the apex of the Platzspitz park.  Flood risk  The river flows through the Sihlsee some upstream of Z√ºrich city centre, and studies have shown that a failure of the dam could lead to an high flood wave reaching the city within 2 hours. This threat is exacerbated by the fact that the river passes through Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof station in a tunnel that limits the river‚Äôs flow capacity, raising concerns about the capacity of the tunnel to deal with extreme flood events. This threat has led the City of Z√ºrich to develop, publish and test evacuation plans for the affected areas of the city.

Established in the late 1959 to develop nuclear space propulsion technologies for the government, the lab was located, for most of its history, in the paradoxically small town of \\"Large\\" along Pa. Rte 51, about south of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania [USA]. The site is not far from the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin, which Westinghouse operated during the same time and later. Town of Large, Pennsylvania Historical Note: The Large site is that of the former Large Distillery, founded by Jonathan Large (1794-1862), who came to the area as a child in 1797 after the Whiskey Rebellion. The distillery originally produced Monongahela rye whiskey, which was a local favorite. Management of the distillery later passed to Jonathan's son, Henry, who ensured the distillery's success by making \\"Large Monongahela Rye Whiskey\\" a national brand. Eventually, the Large Distillery was sold to The National Distillery Company, which retired the Large label but continued to market the whiskey as Old Overholt. The Large distillery eventually ceased operations and the property was sold to a developer who leased it to Westinghouse in the 1950s, and several of the warehouse buildings were adapted for developing and testing reactor plant components for the nuclear submarine development program underway at Bettis under the direction of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. Founding The laboratory was officially founded as a Westinghouse division on July 26, 1959 with six employees and at first operated out of offices in the Pittsburgh suburb of Whitehall. Naval Academy graduate John W. Simpson headed the team with Cornell University physicist Sidney Krasik and Technical Director Frank Cotter as founding members.  WANL's brief but important life cycle  WANL's origins can be traced to 1959 when a dozen engineers and technical specialists from Bettis set up a lab in nearby Whitehall, Pa., for the purpose of bidding on government research and development contracts. In 1960, the operation moved to a new site in Mt. Lebanon, Pa., and continued efforts to land a major development contract. In 1961, NASA's Space Nuclear Propulsion OfficeNERVA, in conjunction with the Atomic Energy Commission, jointly awarded Aerojet General Corporation the prime contract for its Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application NERVA Program, with a significant subcontract to WANL for development of the reactor itself. With the award, WANL selected the Large site as the base for operations and moved its personnel to the facility. Originally authorized in May 1959, WANL officially became a Westinghouse division on July 26, 1959 under the leadership of John Wistar Simpson. Cornell University physicist Sidney Krasik served as the first technical director and Frank Cotter was the first marketing director. Born in 1914, Simpson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1937 and earned an MS from the University of Pittsburgh in 1941. Working in the switchgear division of Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh plant, Simpson helped develop the electric switchboards that could survive the extreme impacts experienced by naval vessels in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1946, he took a leave of absence to work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to familiarize himself with atomic power. Upon his return, he became assistant manager in the engineering department of the Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory. He subsequently managed the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in 1954, the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States. Promoted the next year to general manager of the Bettis Laboratory, he was elected a Westinghouse vice president in 1958 and by 1959 was eager to take on the new challenge of developing nuclear rocket engines to enable the exploration of the solar system. Under the NERVA contract, the initial objective was to build a rocket engine that could deliver at least 825 seconds of specific impulse, at least 50,000 pounds of thrust, at least 10 minutes of continuous operation at full thrust, and have the ability to start up on its own with no external energy source. Liquid hydrogen served as the propellant that was supplied to the reactor core by turbopumps and also provided regenerative cooling. The cylindrical graphite core was surrounded by twelve rotating control drums with beryllium on one side to reflect neutrons and boral on the other side to absorb neutrons to control the rate of the nuclear reaction in the core. The core consisted of clusters of hexagonal graphite fuel elements containing pyrographite-coated beads of uranium pellets coated with niobium carbide to prevent corrosion by exposure to the hydrogen propellant. Each fuel rod cluster was supported by an inconel tie rod. The fuel pellets were provided by Westinghouse Astrofuel's Cheswick plant in Allegheny County. Fuel element corrosion tests were first conducted at Cheswick, and later at the Westinghouse Waltz Mill facility in Westmoreland County. The first proof of concept test of an assembled Westinghouse-Aerojet rocket engine (NRX-A2) was conducted at Jackass Flats, Nevada on September 24, 1964 that provided six minutes of continuous operation. By April 23, 1965 the NRX-A3 provided sixteen minutes of operation and a three-minute restart and incorporated pulse cooling for the first time. In 1966 the NRX-A5/EST delivered two separate periods of full power totaling 30 minutes. On December, 1967 the NRX-A6 delivered sixty minutes of operation at full power and on June 11, 1969 the XE engine was started twenty times for a total of three hours and forty-eight minutes, eleven of which were at full power. By 1970, the proposed NERVA I concept vehicle that evolved out of this work was projected to be capable of delivering 1500 MW of power and 75,000 pounds of thrust. It also had a projected lifetime runtime of ten hours and could be started and stopped up to 60 times while delivering a specific impulse of 850 seconds. Its total weight was less than 15,000 pounds. Westinghouse and Aerojet were ready to begin construction of the first flight engines to be launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida beginning in 1973 when the program was canceled. The total amount spent on the project up to that time was $1.45 billion and more than 1,100 people were employed by the project. A NASA plan released in 1969 to land the first humans on Mars by 1981 using the NERVA engines was also quietly shelved at that time. Government funding for the NERVA program was ended in 1972 due to \\"lack of clear requirements for its capabilities.\\" However, work on the project helped achieve major milestones in developing high-temperature/high-strength materials technology, which finds application in aerospace and a myriad of private-sector industries. While other innovative projects (such as development of a fully implantable, self-contained, nuclear- powered artificial heart) were pursued into the mid-1970s, WANL ceased operations as a formal Westinghouse division shortly thereafter.  Advanced Energy Systems Division  In 1976, the Company changed the name of the site to the Westinghouse Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD), making it an R&D; site for development of nonconventional renewable energy systems. According to the official announcement, AESD's mission would be \\"Engineering today's science into tomorrow's power systems.\\" Under the leadership of Max Johnson, General Manager, AESD engineers designed and built prototype devices such as a heliostat, which was designed to concentrate sunlight (by means of a tracking, flat-mirror assembly) onto a fluid-filled tank mounted on a tower. This hot fluid could then be transferred to the ground and used to produce steam, spinning a turbine to generate electricity. [The Division's heliostat design resulted from a DoE sponsored competition in the late 1970s for the best design for use in the proposed \\"Solar One\\" power tower project near Barstow, California. A prototype was built at the Large site and shipped to the Mojave Desert for testing, but another design ultimately was selected.] Among AESD's successes was the winning site and conceptual design proposal for the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah [now part of Newnan], Coweta County, Georgia, south of Atlanta along I-85. Financed as a joint project by Georgia Power Company (part of Southern Company) and the U.S. Department of Energy, STEP operated from 1982 until 1989. Covering more than , it was the world's largest solar thermal cogeneration project. It consisted of 114 tracking parabolic-dish collectors (7 m dia), which heated a transfer fluid that produced high-pressure steam for generating electricity that was fed to an adjacent knitwear factory owned and operated by Bleyle of Germany. Downstream of the turbine, medium-pressure steam was piped to the plant for knitwear pressing, and low-pressure steam was used to provide air conditioning. The project was dismantled in 1989 when the turbine failed and there were no funds to replace it or provide other needed maintenance on the facility. Other work conducted at AESD included testing of nickel metal hydride battery prototypes. A phosphoric acid fuel cell was designed, built, and tested successfully. Dendritic web silicon photocells were built and tested, and that business was later sold and transferred to Solar Power Industries Inc. of West Newton, Pa. AESD engineers also built a prototype for a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system utilizing hot plasma gases emitted by a coal-fired power plant. The exhaust gasses passed through a copper plate channel, generating additional electricity [up to 30%].  Advanced Power Systems Divisions  During the time that AESD was active, the Large site also housed the Westinghouse Fusion Power Systems Department (FPSD), which had a role in development and startup of the Tokamak Reactor at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in 1982. Along with the Advanced Coal Conversion Department (ACCD) and Advanced Reactors Division (ARD), AESD and FPSD constituted the Company's Advanced Power Systems Business Unit (APSBU), which was based at the Company's Waltz Mill Site in Madison, Pennsylvania, along I-70 a few miles west of the New Stanton interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). ACCD operated a coal gasification process demonstration unit (PDU), which was funded by DoE in the early 1970s, and conducted related research projects. ARD had the development contract for the planned Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) project at Clinch River, Tennessee, near the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The PDU gasifier was eventually sold to Kellogg-Rust, which operated it as Kellogg- Rust-Westinghouse and later KRW Energy Systems. Funding for the LMFBR project was discontinued in 1983, and ARD was merged into AESD at the Large site under Dr. W. Howard Arnold. At the same time, a new Waste Technology Services Division (WTSD), under Leo P. Duffy, was formed to address nuclear waste handling and disposal issues. Both Arnold and Duffy had decades of nuclear- related experience with Westinghouse at Bettis, WANL, and government labs.  1980s and beyond  John Yasinsky, general manager of ACCD in the late 1970s, became general manager of the Advanced Power Systems Divisions in the early 1980s and was named CEO of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the early 1990s. By 1995, Yasinsky had moved on to become chairman and CEO of GenCorp Inc., and Westinghouse acquired and merged with Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), took the name CBS, and began selling off all nonbroadcast operations. This marked the end of the heritage Westinghouse Electric Corporation, although the name \\"Westinghouse\\" endures in various forms for companies in business sectors as diverse as commercial nuclear power, light bulbs, and large and small appliances. The former WANL/AESD/FPSD Large site closed for good in the early 1990s, and space was leased to a range of commercial tenants. In 1994, a group of former employees at the site formed Pittsburgh Materials Technology Inc. (PMTI) to build upon the capabilities developed by Westinghouse, including advanced refractory metal alloys. As of 2007, PMTI was still melting, processing and testing alloys such as niobium-base, tantalum- base, and vanadium-base compositions for a range of customers, particularly in the aerospace sector. In May 2010, PMTI was acquired by Lancaster, PA based Thermacore Inc.https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2010/05/17/daily13.html  References  External links ;Histories of the Astronuclear program:  Engineering companies of the United States Economy of Pittsburgh Research institutes in the United States Science parks in the United States ","title":"Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory"},{"id":"2936681","text":"ET3 or ET-3 may refer to: * Electronics Technician (US Navy), Third Class, United States Naval rating * ET3 (Greece), 3rd channel from Ellinik√≠ Radiofon√≠a Tile√≥rasi (ERT), the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation * Earl Thomas (defensive back), an American football free safety for the Seattle Seahawks * Vespa ET-3, model produced between the 1970s and the mid-1990s * Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies, a business committed to the implementation of Evacuated Tube Transport (ETT) * Endothelin 3, a protein, member of endothelin family ","title":"ET3"},{"id":"2936682","text":"Ovruch (, , ) is a city in the Zhytomyr Oblast (province) of northern Ukraine. It is the administrative center of the Ovruch Raion (district). It has a population of approximately and is home to the Ovruch air base. History Ovruch originated as an important town of Kyivan Rus, first mentioned as Vruchiy in 977. Later after the sack of Iskorosten it became the capital city of Drevlian.Mykhailo Hrushevsky. History of Ukraine-Rus. In the 14th century it became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1483, Crimean Tatars destroyed the settlement. According to the Treaty of Lublin (1569), Volhynia with Owrucz formed a province of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1641, Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa granted Owrucz city rights. It was a royal city of Poland. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 it was annexed by the Russian Empire. The only mark of the town's antiquity is St. Basil's Church, commissioned by Rurik II of Kyiv from his court architect Pyotr Miloneg in the late 1190s. The church was built in Rurik's votchina and was dedicated to his patron saint. Geography Located in northwestern Ukraine, 50 km south of the Belarusian border, Ovruch is part of the geographical region of Polesia. It's located 48 km (30 miles) from Korosten, 133km from Zhytomyr, and 92km from Mazyr, in Belarus; and it's 100km from the ghost town of Pripyat, near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Architecture St. Basil's Church St. Basil's Church has four pillars, three apses and one dome. The western facade is flanked by two round towers, probably in imitation of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The building is distinguished by elaborate brick facades, interlaced with bands of polished colored stone. The complicated design of pilasters points to a complex system of roofing and to a very high dome. The dome and vaults collapsed during the siege of Ovruch by Gediminas in 1321. The ruins of the church survived until 1842, when they crumbled, with the exception of three apses and a portion of the northern wall with an arch. In 1907 Aleksey Shchusev was commissioned to restore the church to its presumed original form, incorporating the remains of Rurik's church into its edifice. Restoration work lasted for two years, and it won Schusev the prestigious title of the Academician of Architecture. More recently, the accuracy of his restoration has been questioned, as it didn't take into account the complicated system of vaulting and the considerable height of the drum. As a consequence of this oversight, the drum was restored according to a model typical of more archaic churches, rather than for the turn of the 13-th century. Adjacent buildings of St. Basil's Convent were built on the model of medieval architecture of Pskov, simultaneously with the restoration of the main church.

William Pettigrew Coming of British in Manipur is the beginning of Christianity in Manipur. But foundation was not laying down during early 1819s till the coming of William Pettigrew in 1894. Here we found some reasonable that, Why British authority so much concerned Christianity in Manipur was as follows: 1) Manipuri king become a puppet king, no socio-political influence as well as religious authority as early did. 2) British thought that Meitei has to civilized by adopting Christianity under the civilizing mission theory etc. Christianity in Manipur can traced back to an Anglican named William Pettigrew, who lived in India when Surchandra Singh was the maharaja of Manipur. Pettigrew, who was born in Edinburgh and educated in London, applied to work with the Arthington Aboriginals Mission in India and travelled to Bengal in 1890. He worked for two years in Dhaka and Silchar. In 1891, Pettigrew applied for permission to work in Manipur, but this was not granted until 1894. He worked for a time as a teacher in Imphal, teaching the children of government civil servants and soon afterwards opened a school for boys in Manipuri and established a permanent mission station there. Pettigrew‚Äôs evangelistic work among the Meitei people in Manipur caused difficulties because of the sensitive political situation there and the more political extreme Hindus complained that he was trying to impose Christianity upon the state. The British authorities withdrew their support and his Arthington Mission sponsors proved unwilling to help him in establishing a mission station. Not wanting to return to England, he applied for membership to the American Baptist Missionary Union in Assam and, after becoming a Baptist, was designated as a Baptist missionary to Manipur. He went on to establish other mission schools within the Ukhrul District.Kangla Online Education in Tangkhul Nagas Region Retrieved on 18 June 2007 Christianity in Manipur The name of the first Meitei to convert to Christianity is unknown. It is traditionally believed that Angom Porom Singh of Phayeng was the first to be converted, but another tradition says that Ningol Kaboklei met a Christian missionary in Sylhet (presently in Bangladesh) and embraced Christianity in around 1893, a few years earlier than the arrival of William Pettigrew. Those claiming that Porom Singh was the first Christian convert, have intentionally ignored the other tradition about Kaboklei. It may well be true that Kaboklei was the first Manipur Christian. During this time, attempts were made to force the Christians to renounce their faith and return to Hinduism. They petitioned the government for land and an area in Thangmeiband was granted to them to build homes. Some theological scholars believe that Porom Singh was baptized on 3 January 1896. On that date, Pettigrew baptized his first Meitei convert at the watering Morangkhom Hiden Tapham. Porom Singh would have been only about eleven or twelve at the time and it is possible that such a public act would have caused uproar. After his baptism, Porom Singh left Imphal with Pettigrew and functioned as Pettigrew's right-hand man at Ukhrul. In December 1912, he became the headmaster of a school at Ukhrul, where his teaching responsibilities included preaching the gospel. He was one of only seven Christians who stood by Pettigrew. At the outbreak of the First World War, he helped Pettigrew to raise a labour corps, later becoming a corps leader and an interpreter. He received excellent testimonials when he served in France and on his return to India, was exempted from house tax. Watkins R. Robert, a Welsh Presbyterian missionary, came to southern Manipur to as a gospel preacher. The local people called him Pu Tlangval ('Sir Youngman'), as he was only twenty-four when he first came to Manipur. Today, the Baptists are found in the northwest and northeast of Manipur, while the majority of Presbyterians are found in the southwest of Manipur, as a result of the missionary work of Roberts. Other, smaller denominational Christians are to be found among the Meitei community. The modern movement The Meitei Christians from Manipur and north-east India are of different denominations, such as Baptist, Presbyterian and Evangelical. The history of Christians among the Meitei community only started to well known in the 1960s. When Christianity was first adopted among the Meitei communities, both the belief system and the theological teaching were based upon biblical teaching. The practice of the Christian faith in present times has changed considerably. There are approximately between 75,000 and 100,000 Meitei Christians in India, and around 2,000 churches. When Hinduism came to Manipur and was adopted by the Meiteis, it was creatively adopted such as Raj Leela, which was promoted by Rabhindranath Takhur, which further helped in expansion of Hindu religion. Similarly, when Meiteis adopt Christianity, it is done as contextually acceptable to indigenous culture, as a tradition of the community. Definitely, a kind of Christianity as different from the practice of Christianity in the hill areas. Some of the churches in Meitei villages (for instance, the tiny Meitei Christian group of 800 to 1000 people from Kakching) have helped transform the lives of local people.

They are accompanied by a full, alphabetized list of citations in an end section, usually titled \\"references\\", \\"reference list\\", \\"works cited\\", or \\"end-text citations\\".\\"Author‚Äìdate system, Chicago Manual of Style, Williams College Libraries, accessed 25 October 2010.Pears, R and Shields, G Cite them right : the essential referencing guide (2008) Parenthetical referencing can be used in lieu of footnote citations (the Vancouver system). There are two styles of parenthetical referencing: * Author‚Äìdate: primarily used in the natural sciences and social sciences, and recommended by the American Chemical Society and the American Psychological Association (APA); * Author‚Äìtitle or author‚Äìpage: primarily used in the arts and the humanities, and recommended by the Modern Language Association (MLA).  Origins and use  The origin of the author‚Äìdate style is attributed to a paper by Edward Laurens Mark, Hersey professor of anatomy and director of the zoological laboratory at Harvard University, who may have copied it from the cataloguing system used then and now by the library of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology.Chernin, Eli (1988). \\"The 'Harvard system': a mystery dispelled\\", British Medical Journal. October 22, 1988, pp. 1062‚Äì1063. In 1881 Mark wrote a paper on the embryogenesis of the garden slug, in which he included an author‚Äìdate citation in parentheses on page 194, the first known instance of such a reference.Mark, Edward Laurens (1881). Maturation, fecundation, and segmentation of Limax campestris, Binney\\", Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, Volume 6, p. 194. Until then, according to Eli Chernin writing in the British Medical Journal, references had appeared in inconsistent styles in footnotes, referred to in the text using a variety of printers' symbols, including asterisks and daggers. Chernin writes that a 1903 festschrift dedicated to Mark by 140 students, including Theodore Roosevelt, confirms that the author‚Äìdate system is attributable to Mark. The festschrift pays tribute to Mark's 1881 paper, writing that it \\"introduced into zoology a proper fullness and accuracy of citation and a convenient and uniform method of referring from text to bibliography.\\" According to an editorial note in the British Medical Journal in 1945, an unconfirmed anecdote is that the term \\"Owen system\\" was introduced by an English visitor to Harvard University library, who was impressed by the citation system and dubbed it \\"Harvard system\\" upon his return to England. Although it originated in biology, it is now more common in humanities, history, and social science. It is favored by a few scientific journals, including the major biology journal Cell.  Author‚Äìdate In the author‚Äìdate method (Harvard referencing), the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports. The citation includes the author's name, year of publication, and page number(s) when a specific part of the source is referred to (Smith 2008, p. 1) or (Smith 2008:1). A full citation is given in the references section: Smith, John (2008). Name of Book. Name of Publisher. =How to cite= The structure of a citation under the author‚Äìdate method is the author's surname, year of publication, and page number or range, in parentheses, as in \\"(Smith 2010, p. 1)\\". * The page number or page range may be omitted if the entire work is cited, as in \\"(Smith 2010)\\". * Narrative style citations have the author appearing as part of the regular text sentence, outside parentheses, as in: \\"Jones (2001) revolutionized the field of trauma surgery.\\" * Two authors are cited using \\"and\\" or \\"&\\": (Deane and Jones 1991) or (Deane & Jones 1991). More than two authors are cited using \\"et al.\\": (Smith et al. 1992). * In some documentation systems (e.g., MLA style), an unknown date is cited as having \\"no date of publication\\" by the abbreviation for \\"no date\\" (Deane, n.d.).\\"References with missing details\\", \\"Harvard System of Referencing Guide\\", University of East Anglia, accessed 25 October 2010. * In such documentation systems, works without pagination are referred to in the References list as \\"not paginated\\" with the abbreviation for that phrase (n. pag.). * \\"No place of publication\\" and/or \\"no publisher\\" are both designated the same way (n.p.) and placed in the appropriate spot in the bibliographical citation (Harvard Referencing. N.p.). * A reference to a republished work is cited with the original publication date either in square brackets (Marx [1867] 1967, p. 90) or separated with a slash (Marx, 1867/1967, p. 90). The inclusion of the original publication year qualifies the suggestion otherwise that the publication originally occurred in 1967. * If an author published several books in 2005, the year of the first publication (in the alphabetic order of the references) is cited and referenced as 2005a, the second as 2005b and so on. * A citation is placed wherever appropriate in or after the sentence. If it is at the end of a sentence, it is placed before the period, but a citation for an entire block quote immediately follows the period at the end of the block since the citation is not an actual part of the quotation itself. When citing quotes its advisable to insert the page number as this points directly to the page the content that has been used. * Complete citations are provided in alphabetical order in a section following the text, usually designated as \\"Works cited\\" or \\"References.\\" The difference between a \\"works cited\\" or \\"references\\" list and a bibliography is that a bibliography may include works not directly cited in the text. * All citations are in the same font as the main text. * Note that there is no official guide to Harvard citation style, consequently variations occur across various online Harvard citation and referencing guides. For example, some universities instruct students to type a book's publication date without parentheses in the reference list. =Examples= An example of a journal reference: *Heilman, J. M. and West, A. G.

In giving the city of publication, an internationally well-known city (such as London, The Hague, or New York) is given as the city alone. If the city is not internationally well known, the country (or state and country if in the U.S.) is given. An example of a newspaper reference: * Bowcott, Owen (October 18, 2005). \\"Protests halt online auction to shoot stag\\", The Guardian. =Advantages= * The principal advantage of the author‚Äìdate method is that a reader familiar with a field is likely to recognize a citation without having to check in the references section. This is most useful in fields whose works are commonly known by their date of publication (for example, the sciences and social sciences in which one cites, say, \\"the 2005 Johns Hopkins study of brain function\\"), or if the author cited is notorious (for example, HIV denialist Peter Duesberg on the cause of AIDS). * The use of author‚Äìdate systems helps the reader easily identify sources that may be outdated. * If the same source is cited more than once, even a reader unfamiliar with the author may remember the name. It quickly becomes obvious if the publication is relying heavily on a single author or single publication. When many different pages of the same work are cited, the reader does not need to flip back and forth to footnotes or endnotes full of \\"ibid.\\" citations to discover this fact. * With the author‚Äìdate method, there is no renumbering hassle when the order of in-text citations is changed, which can be a scourge of the numbered endnotes system if house style or project style insists that citations never appear out of numerical order. (Computerized reference-management software automates this aspect of the numbered system [for example, Microsoft Word's endnote system, Wikipedia's system, LaTeX/BibTeX, or various applications marketed to professionals].) * Parenthetical referencing works well in combination with substantive notes. When the note system is used for source citations, two different systems of note marking and placement are needed‚Äîin Chicago Style, for instance, \\"the citation notes should be numbered and appear as endnotes. The substantive notes, indicated by asterisks and other symbols, appear as footnotes\\" (\\"Chicago Manual of Style\\" 2003, 16.63-64). This approach can be cumbersome in any circumstances. When it is not possible to use footnotes altogether probably because of the publisher's policy, it results in two parallel series of endnotes, which can be confusing to readers. Using parenthetical referencing for sources avoids such a problem. * The reader can find the in-text author‚Äìdate citations of a specific work more easily. Finding in-text numbered citations is more difficult because some will not appear if they are included in ranges. =Disadvantages= * The principal disadvantage of parenthetical references is they take up space in the main body of the text and are distracting to a reader, especially when many works are cited in a single place (which often occurs when reviewing a large body of previous work). Numbered footnotes or endnotes, by contrast, can be combined into a range, e.g. \\"[27‚Äì35]\\". However this disadvantage is offset by the fact that parenthetical referencing may be economical for the overall document since, for instance, \\"(Smith 2008: 34)\\" takes up a small amount of space in a paragraph, whereas the same information would require a whole line in a footnote or endnote. * In many disciplines in the arts and humanities, date of publication is often not the most important piece of information about a particular work. Thus, in author‚Äìdate references such as \\"(Dickens 2003: 10)\\", the date is essentially redundant or meaningless when read on the page, since works may go through numerous editions or translations long after the original publication. Compare a reference in a science discipline such as \\"The last survey indicated that four hundred were left in the wild (Jones et al. 2003)\\", where the date is meaningful. The reader of certain forms of arts and humanities scholarship may thus be better aided by the use of author‚Äìtitle referencing styles such as MLA: for example, \\"(Dickens Oliver, 10)\\", where meaningful information is given on the page. Historical scholarship is an exception, since, when citing a primary source, date of publication is meaningful, though in most branches of history footnotes are preferred on other grounds. Generally speaking, however, it is instructive that author‚Äìdate systems such as Harvard were devised by scientists, whereas author‚Äìtitle systems such as MLA were devised by humanities scholars. * Similarly, because works are frequently reprinted in many arts and humanities disciplines, different author‚Äìdate references might refer to the same work. For example, \\"(Spivak 1985)\\", \\"(Spivak 1987)\\", and \\"(Spivak 1996)\\" might all refer to the same essay ‚Äî and might be better rendered in author‚Äìtitle style as \\"(Spivak 'Subaltern')\\". Such ambiguities may be resolved by adding an original date of publication, for example, \\"(Spivak 1985/1996)\\", though this is cumbersome and exacerbates the principal disadvantage of parenthetical referencing, namely its distraction for the reader and unattractiveness on the page. * Rules can be complicated or unclear for non-academic references, particularly those where the personal author is unknown, such as government-issued documents and standards. * When removing a portion of text which has citations in it, the editor(s) must also check the Reference sections to see if the sources cited in the removed text is used elsewhere in the paper or book, and if not, to delete any reference not actually cited in the text (although this issue can be eliminated by the use of reference manager software). * The use of the author‚Äìdate methods (but not author‚Äìtitle) can be confusing when used in monographs about particularly prolific authors. In-text citation and back-of- the-book listings of works arranged by date of publication are conducive to errors and confusion: for example, Harvey 1996a, Harvey 1996b, Harvey 1996c, Harvey 1996d, Harvey 1995a, Harvey 1995b, Harvey 1986a, Harvey 1986b, and so on. * The mixing of text with frequent parentheses and long strings of numbers is typographically inelegant. * Most historical journals (apart from economic and social history) use footnotes because of the need for maximum flexibility. Primary source references to archives, etc., involve long and complex information, all of which may be immediately relevant to a serious reader. An interesting example of this arose with the famous work of the anthropologists John and Jean Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution which treated historical events from anthropological perspective: although parenthetical references were used for scholarly sources, the authors found it necessary to use notes for the historical archive material they were also using. * If parenthetical referencing is combined with alphabetic order of author names, this can lead to discrimination of authors with last names starting with a letter in the end of the alphabet. Studies have demonstrated that alphabetical lists can lead to a significant discrimination of authors with last names in the end of such lists (e.g., funding, citations).Einav, L., & Yariv, L. (2006). What's in a surname? The effects of surname initials on academic success. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 20(1), 175-187. Some style guides therefore suggest to list the authors chronologically instead. Author‚Äìtitle In the author‚Äìtitle or author‚Äìpage method, also referred to as MLA style, the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports, and includes the author's name (a short title only is necessary when there is more than one work by the same author) and a page number where appropriate (Smith 1) or (Smith, Playing 1). (No \\"p.\\" or \\"pp.\\" prefaces the page numbers and main words in titles appear in capital letters, following MLA style guidelines.) A full citation is given in the references section. Content notes A content note generally contains useful information and explanations that do not fit into the primary text itself. Content notes may be given as footnotes or endnotes or even a combination of both footnotes and endnotes. Such content notes may themselves contain a style of parenthetical referencing, just as the main text does.

Although it is a ruin, visitors can still see the original monks‚Äô church, their cloister and their dovecot (pigeon tower). Foundation Founded in 1244 by Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, following an earlier donation of 1225, to the monks of Paisley Abbey for that purpose. They reputedly built nothing more than a small chapel and kept the balance for themselves. The Earl took the matter to the Bishop of Glasgow for arbitration and, winning his case, forced the monks to build a proper abbey.ibidem pp. 1-6 Name The origin of the abbey's name refers to the ancient Cross of Riaghail (Latin form St Regulus) that stood on the spot. Crossraguel was a Cluniac abbey and the monks - members of a branch of the Benedictines - were known as the \\"Black monks\\" after the colour of their clothes.  History  Crossraguel Abbey was founded in 1244 by Duncan, 1st Earl of Carrick. The earl sought assistance from the abbot and monks of Paisley Abbey and provided them with land and funds. However, the Paisley superiors built only a small chapel for Crossraguel and kept the remainder for themselves. Upset at this, the earl took the case to law, seeking assistance from the Bishop of Glasgow, who ruled on the earl's behalf. He required not only that Paisley build the monastery at Crossraguel, but also that some of the monks from Paisley should be transferred there. These monks were given the authority to choose their own abbot. The abbot of Paisley, it was decreed, was not to interfere with Crossraguel's affairs, though he was allowed a yearly visit. All of Paisley's possessions in Carrick were to be handed over to Crossraguel, a ruling which the abbot of Paisley appealed to the pope in 1265, but to no avail. Crossraguel was sacked in 1307 by the army of Edward I. It was rebuilt on a larger scale and remained a monastery until 1560, when the Reformation ended monastic institutions in Scotland. However, the few remaining monks were allowed to live out their time there until the last monk died in 1601. Some of the stone has been removed for local construction, but the Abbey ruins remain some of the most complete of any medieval religious house to survive in Scotland. Like Paisley Abbey, Crossraguel was of the Order of Cluny whose mission was to encourage pilgrimage. It is no accident then that Crossraguel is half-way between Paisley and Whithorn on the Ayrshire pilgrims' trail to the shrine of St Ninian in The Machars of Galloway. The site is looked after by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument and is open to the public with an entrance charge. In Autumn, 1506, Montjoie (Gilbert Chauveau), French King of Arms, visited Crossraguel probably as part of his diplomatic missions regarding Scottish military support for King Hans (John) of Denmark.Brittain, J. & Brown, J. (2016) 'And uther placis': two French ambassadorial missions in Ayrshire, Scottish Local History Journal, Issue 94. Montjoie had already spent time at the Court of King Henry VII of England before moving to Scotland and from there, visited Denmark.

HB The Reichsthaler () was a standard Thaler silver coin of the Holy Roman Empire, established in 1566 by the Leipzig convention. This original Reichsthaler specie was supplemented in the 16th century by various Reichsthaler units of account in northern Germany in the 17th century and by a Prussian Reichsthaler coin in 1750. Reichsthaler coin or specie The Leipzig convention set the Reichsthaler as a coin containing of a Cologne mark or 25.98 grams of silver. The various German states within the Empire issued Reichsthaler together with smaller coins according to whatever system of subdivisions they chose. This coin was continuously minted since 1566 in most of Northern Europe until the introduction of competing coins like the Conventionsthaler (coined 10 to a mark of silver) in 1751 and the Prussian thaler (coined 14 to a mark of silver) in 1750. However, it remained the primary trade coin in Scandinavia and the Baltics well into the 19th century. The fine silver content of the Dutch rijksdaalder was maintained at 528.5 azen or 25.40 grams during the 17th century.200 azen = 9.613 g in p 353; hence 528.5 azen = 25.40 g. https://books.google.com/books?id=GrJCAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA356#v=onepage&q;=patacon&f;=false This was close to the average silver content of 25.37 g for circulating reichsthalers.441.96 grains x0.886 = 28.639 g x0.886 = 25.37 g. https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Rix-Dollar.intro.html Exchange banks like the Hamburg Bank were established to receive silver from depositors and to credit their accounts in a Reichsthaler-equivalent bank currency called the Hamburg thaler banco. As of the end of the 18th century, each Cologne mark or 233.856 grams of fine silver was bought for 9 thalers banco (or 25.40 g per thaler) and was sold for 9 thalers (or 25.28 g per thaler). See also: Hamburg mark; https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Banco Another popular Reichsthaler- sized trade coin from the Austrian Netherlands was the Kronenthaler, containing 25.7 g fine silver and valued at 2.7 gulden in the Netherlands and Southern Germany. Reichsthaler unit of account At the same time as the Reichsthaler was being issued as a coin, efforts were made starting in the mid-17th century to define a new Reichsthaler unit of account for use throughout Northern Germany but worth a fraction of the circulating Reichsthaler coin. One example, the 1690 Leipzig thaler worth of a mark or th of the original Reichsthaler specie, was widely used though not universally adopted. In 1754 the Conventionsthaler became the standard coin in most of Northern Germany with the Reichsthaler unit of accounts defined as 1/(13) of a mark or th of a Conventionsthaler (or 17.54 g fine silver). Most states divide this Reichsthaler into 24 groschen or Gutegroschen, each worth 12 pfennig. Other related Reichsthaler units of account include the Danish rigsdaler courant, worth a Rigsdaler specie, and the Swedish riksdaler riksmynt, worth th a Riksdaler specie. Prussian Reichsthaler In 1750, Prussia adopted a Reichsthaler (also often called the thaler) containing of a Cologne mark, or 16.70 g of fine silver. This standard was referred to as the Graumannscher Fu√ü after Johann Philipp Graumann, its originator. The Prussian thaler existed both as a real coin as well as a unit of account. In the early 19th century, this thaler replaced the 17.54-gram North German reichsthaler as the standard unit of account. The Prussian standard also became part of the currency used in southern Germany following the currency union of 1837. The thaler was worth Gulden. These thalers were replaced by the Vereinsthaler, of almost the same weight, in 1857.

The valley is located approximately north of Lithgow and 150 kilometres north-west of Sydney.Gregory's State Road Map of New South Wales, Map 221, 11th Edition. Accessible by the Wolgan Valley Discovery Trail (Wolgan Road) from the Castlereagh Highway, the road travels through the valley leading onto the historical village of Newnes and its extensive industrial ruins. Description and history Wolgan Valley is formed by the Wolgan River in rugged mountainous country west of Sydney in Lithgow north of the city. It flows broadly east until it joins the Capertee River, after which it becomes the Colo River. The latter then continues east through the Wollemi Wilderness which is the largest wilderness area in New South Wales and the largest in eastern Australia. The Wolgan Valley includes sections of Wollemi National Park, Gardens of Stone National Park and the UNESCO declared Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. The valley was inhabited by Aboriginal Australians for thousands of years, but the First European settlement occurred around 1823, when brothers William and James Walker used the valley as an outstation for their Wallerawang property \\"Wallerowang\\". It is best known for its historic railway tunnel and the former Commonwealth Oil Corporation shale oil mining operations at Newnes. The Railway tunnel formed part of a heavy-haul line between Newnes and Newnes junction on the main western railway. Four heavy Shay type locomotives were used to haul the products of the works at Newnes up grades as steep as 1 in 25. The name of the Wolgan Valley is derived from \\"wolga\\", a local Australian Aboriginal language name for the climbing plant, Clematis aristata, found in coastal regions of the South-East states of Australia. Within the Wolgan Valley there are several significant Aboriginal sacred sites. These include Maiyingu Marragu (Blackfellows Hands) which is a collection of Aboriginal hand stencils located near Wolgan Gap, and several Aboriginal burial sites. The bush walking trails in the area include the Pipeline Track, which goes from Newnes to Glen Davis,Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.308 and the Wolgan Valley Heritage Trail (see links below), as well as the track from Newnes to the Glowworm Tunnel. There are also camping grounds that are open to the public. The valley also contains numerous slot canyons and is popular for rockclimbing.

When California was admitted as a state to the United States in 1850, and for nearly two decades thereafter, it was in many ways isolated, an outpost on the Pacific, until the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869. Passenger rail transportation declined in the early- and mid-20th Century with the rise of the state's car culture and road system. It has since undergone something of a renaissance, with the introduction of services such as Metrolink, Coaster, Caltrain, Amtrak California, and others. On November 4, 2008, the People of California passed Proposition 1a, which helped provide financing for a high- speed rail line. 19th century =Background= The early Forty-Niners of the California Gold Rush wishing to come to California were faced with limited options. From the East Coast, for example, a sailing voyage around the tip of South America would take five to eight months, and cover some 18,000 nautical miles (33,000 km). An alternative route was to sail to the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama, to take canoes and mules for a week through the jungle, and then on the Pacific side, to wait for a ship sailing for San Francisco.Brands, H. W. (2003), pp. 75-85. Another route across Nicaragua was developed in 1851; it was not as popular as the Panama option. (see ) During the 1850s the voy:Ruta de Transito through Nicaragua was another option. Eventually, most gold-seekers took the overland route across the continental United States, particularly along the California Trail.Rawls and Orsi, (1999) p. 5. Each of these routes had its own deadly hazards, from shipwreck to typhoid fever to cholera or Indian attack.Duke and Kistler, p. 9 =Transcontinental links= The very first \\"inter-oceanic\\" railroad that affected California was built in 1855 across the Isthmus of Panama, the Panama Railway.Otis, Fessenden Nott (M.D.). Isthmus of Panama: History of the Panama railroad; and of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1867 pp. 15-16; 50-56.The Panama Railroad: 1865, 1868 & 1871 Certificates of Stock; an 1855 Newspaper Report of its Opening; 1861 & 1913 Maps; Early Harper's Engravings; and 1861 Schedule of Regular, Special and \\"Steamer\\" Trains. The Panama Railway reduced the time needed to cross the Isthmus from a week of difficult and dangerous travel to a day of relative comfort. The building of the Panama Railroad, in combination with the increasing use of steamships (instead of sailing ships) meant that travel to and from California via Panama was the primary method used by people who could afford to do so, and was used for valuable cargo, such as the gold being shipped from California to the East Coast.One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane off the coast of the Carolinas in 1857, with an estimated three tons of California gold aboard. (see ) Another notable ship wreck was the steamship Winfield Scott, bound to Panama from San Francisco, which crashed into Anacapa Island off the Southern California coast in December 1853. All hands and passengers were saved, along with the cargo of gold, but the ship was a total loss. The Golden Spike ceremony held at Promontory Summit, Utah on May 10, 1869. Photograph by Andrew J. Russell. California's symbolic and tangible connection to the rest of the country was fused at Promontory Summit, Utah, as the \\"last spike\\" was driven to join the tracks of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads, thereby completing the First Transcontinental Railroad on May 10, 1869 (before that time, only a few local rail lines operated in the State, the first being the Sacramento Valley Railroad).Daniels, p. 53 The 1,600 mile (2,575-kilometer) trip from Omaha, Nebraska, would now take mere days. The Wild West was quickly transformed from a lawless, agrarian frontier to what would become an urbanized, industrialized economic and political powerhouse. Of perhaps greater significance is the unbridled economic growth that was spurred on by the sheer diversity of opportunities available in the region. The four years following the Golden Spike ceremony saw the length of track in the U.S. double to over 70,000 miles (nearly 113,000 kilometers).Daniels, p. 54 By around the start of the 20th century, the completion of four subsequent transcontinental routes in the United States and one in Canada would provide not only additional pathways to the Pacific Ocean, but would forge ties to all of the economically important areas between the coasts as well. Virtually the entire country was accessible by rail, making a national economy possible for the first time. And while federal financial assistance (in the form of land grants and guaranteed low-interest loans, a well-established government policy) was vital to the railroads' expansion across North America, this support accounted for less than eight percent (8%) of the total length of rails laid; private investment was responsible for the vast majority of railroad construction.Daniels, p. 55 As rail lines pushed further and further into the wilderness, they opened up huge areas that would have otherwise lain fallow. The railroads helped establish countless towns and settlements, paved the way to abundant mineral deposits and fertile tracts of pastures and farmland, and created new markets for eastern goods. It is estimated that by the end of World War II, rail companies nationwide remunerated to the government over $1 billion dollars, more than eight times the original value of the lands granted.Robinson, p. 157 The principal commodity transported across the rails to California was people: by reducing the cross-country travel time to as little as six days, men with westward ambitions were no longer forced to leave their families behind. The railroads would, in time, provide equally important linkages to move the inhabitants throughout the state, interconnecting its blossoming communities. J. D. Spreckels drives the \\"golden spike\\" to ceremonially complete the San Diego & Arizona Railway on November 15, 1919. \\"Transportation determines the flow of population,\\" declared J. D. Spreckels, one of California's early railroad entrepreneurs, just after the dawn of the twentieth century. \\"Before you can hope to get people to live anywhere...you must first of all show them that they can get there quickly, comfortably and, above all, cheaply.\\"Dodge, p. 18 Among Spreckels' many accomplishments was the formation of the San Diego Electric Railway in 1892, which radiated out from downtown to points north, south, and east and helped urbanize San Diego. Henry Huntington, the nephew of Central Pacific founder Collis P. Huntington, would develop his Pacific Electric Railway in Los Angeles and Orange Counties with much the same result. Spreckels' greatest challenge would be to provide San Diego with its own direct transcontinental rail link in the form of the San Diego and Arizona Railway (completed in November 1919), a feat that nearly cost the sugar heir his life.Hanft, p. 77 The Central Pacific Railroad, in effect, initiated the trend by offering settlement incentives in the form of low fares, and by placing sections of its government-granted lands up for sale to pioneers. When the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad charted its own solo course across the continent in 1885 it chose Los Angeles as its western terminus, and in doing so fractured the Southern Pacific Railroad's near total monopoly on rail transportation within the state. The original purpose of this new line was to augment the route to San Diego, established three years prior as part of a joint venture with the California Southern Railroad, but the Santa Fe would subsequently be forced to all but abandon these inland tracks through the Temecula Canyon (due to constant washouts) and construct its Surf Line along the coast to maintain its exclusive ties to Los Angeles.Duke, p. 43 Santa Fe's entry into Southern California resulted in widespread economic growth and ignited a fervent rate war with the Southern Pacific, or \\"Espee\\" as the road was often referred to; it also led to Los Angeles' well-documented real estate \\"Boom of the Eighties\\".Donaldson and Myers, p. 58 The Santa Fe Route led the way in passenger rate reductions (often referred to as \\"colonist fares\\") by, within a period of five months, lowering the price of a ticket from Kansas City, Missouri to Los Angeles from $125 to $15, and, on March 6, 1887 to a single dollar.Duke and Kistler, p. 32 The Southern Pacific soon followed suit and the level of real estate speculation reached a new high, with \\"boom towns\\" springing up literally overnight. Free, daily railroad-sponsored excursions (complete with lunch and live entertainment) enticed overeager potential buyers to visit the many undeveloped properties firsthand and (hopefully) invest in the potential of the land. streetcar of the Pacific Electric Railway makes a stop at Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel, circa 1905. Unfortunately, as with the Comstock mining securities boom of the 1870s, Los Angeles' land boom attracted an unscrupulous element that often sold interest in properties whose titles were not properly recorded, or in tracts that did not even exist.Beebe, p. 240 Major advertising campaigns by the SP, Santa Fe, Union Pacific, and other major carriers of the day not only helped transform southern California into a major tourist attraction but generated intense interest in exploiting the area's agricultural potential.Rawls and Bean, p. 207 Word of the abundant work opportunities, high wages, and the temperate and healthful California climate spread throughout the Midwestern United States, and led to an exodus from such states as Iowa, Indiana, and Kansas; although the real estate bubble \\"burst\\" in 1889 and most investors lost their all, the Southern California landscape was forever transformed by the many towns, farms, and citrus groves left in the wake of this event. Historians James Rawls and Walton Bean have speculated that were it not for the discovery of gold in 1848, Oregon might have been granted statehood ahead of California, and therefore the first Pacific Railroad might have been built to that state, or at least been born to a more benevolent group of founding fathers.Rawls and Bean, p. 112 This speculation lacks support, however, when one considers that a significant hide and tallow trade between California and the eastern seaports was already well- established, that the federal government had long planned for the acquisition of San Francisco Bay as a western port, and that suspicions regarding England's intentions towards potentially extending their holdings in the region southward into California would almost certainly have forced the government to embark on the same course of action. While the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad would rightfully be remembered as a major milestone in America's history, it would also foster the birth of a railroad empire that would have a dominant influence over California's evolution for years to come. Despite all of the shortcomings, in the end the State reaped innumerable and unprecedented benefits from its associations with the railroad companies, which helped put California \\"on the map.\\" =Agriculture= A special \\"fast fruit\\" train of the Central Pacific Railroad prepares to head eastward on June 24, 1886. Even today, California is well known for the abundance and many varieties of fruit trees that are cultivated throughout the state. The only fruits indigenous to the region, however, consisted of wild berries or grew on small bushes. Spanish missionaries brought fruit seeds over from Europe, many of which had been introduced to the Old World from Asia following earlier expeditions to the continent; orange, grape, apple, peach, pear, and fig seeds were among the most prolific of the imports. Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel, fourth in the Alta California chain, was founded in 1771 near what would one day be the City of Los Angeles.Wright, p. 25 Thirty-three years later the mission would unknowingly witness the origin of the California citrus industry with the planting of the region's first significant orchard, though the commercial potential of citrus would not be realized until 1841.Thompson, p. 341 Several small carloads of California crops were shipped eastward via the new transcontinental route almost immediately after its completion, using a special type of ventilated boxcar modified specifically for this purpose. The advent of the iced refrigerator car or \\"reefer\\" led to increases in both the amount of product carried and in the distances traveled. For years, the overall scarcity of oranges in particular led to the general perception that they were suitable only for holiday table decoration or as indulgences for the affluent. During the 1870s, however, hybridization of California oranges led to the creation of several flavorful strains, chief among these the Navel and Valencia varieties, whose development allowed for year-round cultivation of the fruit. Substantial foreign (out-of-state) markets for California citrus would come into full stature by 1890, initiating a period referred to as the Orange Era.Thompson, p. 342 As the market for agricultural goods outside the state's boundaries increased, the Santa Fe developed a massive fleet of refrigerator dispatch cars, and in 1906 the Southern Pacific joined with the Union Pacific Railroad to create the Pacific Fruit Express.Daniels, p. 94 Fully half the farm products produced in California could now be exported throughout the country, with western railroads carrying virtually all of the perishable fruit traffic.Duke, p. 403 The western states of California, Arizona, and Oregon would dominate U.S. agricultural production by the coming of the Great Depression; once such diverse and high-demand crops as wheat, sugar beets, olives, and lettuce were cultivated, California would become known as the nation's \\"produce basket.\\"Thompson, p. 343 =Oil boom= Restored Southern Pacific Lines No. 2353, a 4-6-0 oil-burning steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1912. The cylindrical tender, specifically designed to carry fuel oil, was a signature feature of the railroad. With the expansion of agriculture interests throughout the state (along with new rail lines to carry the goods to faraway markets), new communities were founded and existing towns expanded. Agrarian successes led to the establishment of post offices, schools, churches, mercantile outlets, and ancillary industries such as packing houses. The discovery of brea, more commonly referred to as tar, in Southern California would lead to an oil boom in the early twentieth century. Railroad companies soon discovered that shipping wooden barrels loaded with oil via boxcars was not cost-effective, and developed steel cylindrical tank cars capable of transporting bulk liquids virtually anywhere. By 1915, the transportation of petroleum products had become a lucrative endeavor for western railroads.Duke, p. 404 Most oil tank cars would remain in revenue service for decades until the \\"Black Bonanza\\" had run its course. The Southern Pacific is credited with being the first western railroad to experiment in 1879 with the use of oil in its locomotives as a fuel source in lieu of coal (with substantial technical assistance from the Union Oil Company, one of the SP's biggest accounts).Duke, p. 432 By 1895, oil-burning locomotives were in operation on a number of Southern Pacific routes, and on the competing California Southern and Great Northern Railway as well.Yenne, p. 53 This innovation not only allowed the SP (and other railroads that soon followed their example) to benefit from the use of this abundant and economically viable fuel source, but to create new markets by capitalizing on the burgeoning petroleum industry. The conversion from coal to oil also help solved the Southern Pacific's problem of intense smoke in the tunnels of the Sierra Nevada. Thanks to the railroads, California was once again thrust into the limelight. =Tourism= \\"Old No. 4\\", said to be the first engine over the Sierra Nevada, from a postcard, circa 1910 As has been previously discussed, the railroads were among the first to promote California tourism as early as the 1870s, both as a means to increase ridership and to create new markets for the freight hauling business in the areas they served.Duke and Kistler, p. 60 Some sixty years later, the Santa Fe would lead a resurgence in leisure travel to and along the west coast aboard such \\"name\\" trains as the Chief and later the Super Chief; the Southern Pacific would soon follow suit with their Golden State and Overland Flyer trains, and the Union Pacific with its City of Los Angeles and City of San Francisco. The immense popularity of Helen Hunt Jackson's 1884 novel Ramona in particular fueled a surge in tourism, which happened to coincide with the opening of SP's Southern California lines. The Santa F√© embraced the aura of the American Southwest in its advertising campaigns as well as its operations. The AT&SF; routes and the high level of service provided thereon became popular with stars of the film industry in the thirties, forties and fifties, both building on and adding to the Hollywood mystique. The \\"golden age\\" of railroading would eventually end as travel by automobile and airplane became more cost-effective, and popular. =Corruption and scandal= \\"The Curse of California\\" by G. Frederick Keller appeared in San Francisco's The Wasp on August 19, 1882. The illustration portrays the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad monopoly as an octopus, with the State's various financial interests wrapped within its many tentacles. In 1901, Frank Norris vilified the Southern Pacific for its monopolistic practices in his acclaimed novel The Octopus: A Story of California; John Moody's 1919 work The Railroad Builders: A Chronicle of the Welding of the State referred to \\"the American railroad problem\\" wherein the men who rode the iron horse were characterized as \\"monsters\\" that too often suppressed government reform and economic growth through political chicanery and corrupt business practices.Moody, p. 237 While it is true that much of the traveling public would have been unable to make the trip to California's sunny climate were it not for the fleet, relatively safe, and affordable trains of the western railroads, it is also true that those companies in effect preyed on those same settlers once they arrived at the end of the line. For instance, while the railroads provided much-needed transportation routes to out-of-state markets for locally produced raw materials and avenues of the import for eastern goods, there were numerous instances of rate fixing schemes among the various carriers, the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific included.Lewis, p. 366 Opposition to the railroads began early in Southern California's history due to the questionable practices of The Big Four in conducting the business of the Central (later Southern) Pacific. The Central Pacific Railroad (and later the Southern Pacific) maintained and operated whole fleets of ferry boats that connected Oakland with San Francisco by water. Early on, the Central Pacific gained control of the existing ferry lines for the purpose of linking the northern rail lines with those from the south and east; during the late 1860s the company purchased nearly every bayside plot in Oakland, creating what author and historian Oscar Lewis described as a \\"wall around the waterfront\\" that put the town's fate squarely in the hands of the corporation.Lewis, p. 371 Competitors for ferry passengers or dock space were ruthlessly run out of business, and not even stage coach lines could escape the group's notice, or wrath. The Southern Pacific Company's Bay City ferry plies the waters of San Francisco Bay in the late 19th century. The Northern California railroad barons also effectively slowed San Diego's development in the early 20th century. San Diego had a natural harbor and many thought that it would become a major port on the west coast. However, San Francisco was strongly opposed to this as San Diego's development would hurt their trade. Charles Crocker, the manager of Central Pacific Railroad was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúI would not take the road to San Diego as a gift. We would blot San Diego out of existence if we could, but as we can[']t do that we shall keep it back as long as we can.‚Äù Instead, the Central Pacific only extended their rail route into Los Angeles.\\" Competition between carriers for rail routes was fierce as well, and unscrupulous means were often used to gain any advantage over one another. Santa Fe work crews engaged in sabotage to slow the progress of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad through the Rockies as the two fought their way toward the Coast; the Santa Fe (in conjunction with the California Southern) would win the race in establishing its connection to Bakersfield in 1883. Some eleven years earlier, the Southern Pacific essentially blackmailed the then-fledgling City of Los Angeles into paying a hefty subsidy to ensure that the railroad‚Äôs north-south line would pass through town; in 1878, the company would be rebuffed in its attempts to extend its Anaheim branch southward to San Diego through Orange County's Irvine Ranch without securing the permission of James Irvine, Sr., a longtime rival of Collis Huntington.Donaldson and Myers, p. 14 The Southern Pacific would similarly block the westward progress of the Santa Fe (known to some as the People's Railroad) until September 1882, when a group of enraged citizens ultimately forced the railroad's management to relent.Donaldson and Myers, p. 43 Numerous accounts of similar \\"frog wars\\" and other such tactics have been recorded throughout California's railroad history. Perhaps the most notorious examples of impropriety on the part of the railroads surround the process of land acquisition and sales. Since the federal government granted to the companies alternate tracts of land that ran along the tracks they had laid, it was generally assumed that the land would in turn be sold at its fair market value at the time the land was subdivided; circulars distributed by the SP (which was at the time a holding company formed by the Central Pacific Railroad) certainly implied as much. However, at least some of the tracts were put on the market only after considerable time had passed, and the land improved well beyond its raw state.Yenne, p. 31 Families faced with asking prices of ten times or more of the initial value more often than not had no choice but to vacate their homes and farms, in the process losing everything they worked for; often it turned out to be a railroad employee who had purchased the property in question. A group of immigrant San Joaquin Valley farmers formed the Settlers' League in order to challenge the Southern Pacific's actions in court, but after all of the lawsuits were decided in the favor of the railroads, one group decided to take matters into their own hands. What resulted was the infamous Battle at Mussel Slough, in which armed settlers clashed with railroad employees and law enforcement officers engaged in eviction proceedings. Six people were killed in the ensuing gunfight.Daniels, p. 59 The Southern Pacific would emerge from the tragedy as the prime target of journalists such as William Randolph Hearst, ambitious politicians, and crusade groups for decades to follow.Yenne, p. 74 Leland Stanford's term as Governor of California (while still serving on the SP's board of directors) enhanced the corporation's political clout, but simultaneously further increased its notoriety as well. =Regulation= Public response to the corruption that arose from California's economic \\"explosion\\" led to the enactment of numerous reform and regulation measures, many of which coincided with the ascendancy of the Populist and Progressive movements. Early examples of railroad regulation include Granger case decisions in the 1870s, and the creation of the first (albeit ineffective) Railroad Commission via amendment of the State's Constitution of 1879, forerunner of today's California Public Utilities Commission. In 1886, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Santa Clara County in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad. The documents of the Court decision included a statement that a corporation henceforth could be considered an American citizen, with all the associated immunities and privileges (except the right to vote). The document phrasing has long made it difficult for states to pass legislation that could make corporations accountable to the people. The Stetson-Eshelman Act of 1911 provided for the fixing of shipping rates by state legislatures. In 1911, California's new Progressive government established the second Railroad Commission, more effective and less corrupted than the first one. 20th century =Buses replace streetcars and interurbans= Schematics for the Yerba Buena Tunnel (looking west), showing the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge's original configuration featuring a double-track interurban railway (lower right). November, 1933 Passenger rail in California during the early 20th Century was dominated by private companies. Interurban railways gained popularity in the early part of the century as a means of medium-distance travel, usually as components of real estate speculation schemes. The Pacific Electric Railway Company Red Car Lines was the largest electric railway system in the world by the 1920s, with over of tracks and 2,160 daily services across Los Angeles and Orange Counties. The Sacramento Northern Railway operated the world's longest single electric interurban service between Oakland and Chico. These and other services were largely abandoned in the 1940s and 50s as ridership declined and equipment fell into disrepair. Local services were mostly controlled by a few primary operators. The San Diego Electric Railway, founded by John D. Spreckels in 1892, was the major transit system in the San Diego area during that period. In the Los Angeles area, real estate tycoon Henry Huntington established both the Los Angeles Railway, also known as the Yellow Car system, and the above- mentioned Pacific Electric Red Car System in 1901. The San Francisco Municipal Railway was established in 1912. Business magnate Francis Marion Smith then created the Key System in 1903 to connect San Francisco with the East Bay. The San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge opened to rail traffic in 1939 only to have the last trains run in 1958 after fewer than twenty years of service ‚Äì the tracks were torn up and replaced with additional lanes for automobiles. All four streetcar systems, and other similar rail networks across the state, declined in the 1940s with the rise of California's car culture and freeway network. They were then all eventually taken over to some degree, and dismantled, in favor of bus service by National City Lines, a controversial national front company owned by General Motors and other companies in what became known as the General Motors streetcar conspiracy. San Francisco's city- owned lines were not privatized, but were still largely converted to bus and trolleybuses. =Modern light rail and subway systems= Aerial view of BART's Pleasant Hill station under construction in 1970 One urban system that survived the streetcar decline was the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) in San Francisco. Its five heavily used streetcar lines traveled for at least part of their routes through tunnels or otherwise reserved right-of-way, and thus could not be converted to bus lines. As a result, these lines, running PCC streetcars, continued in operation for several decades. When plans for stations in the double-decker Market Street Subway tunnel through downtown San Francisco, with BART on the lower level and MUNI on the upper level, required high platforms, it meant that the PCCs could not be used in them. Hence, MUNI ordered a fleet of new light rail vehicles, and Muni Metro began service in 1980. The San Francisco cable car system came under full Municipal ownership in 1952, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 after almost being replaced entirely by buses in the previous decades. The system had fallen into disrepair by the 70s and a massive overhaul of the system resulted in the lines current configuration opening in 1984. Planning for a modern, urban rapid transit system in California did not begin until the 1950s, when California's legislature created a commission to study the Bay Area's long- term transportation needs. Based on the commission's report, the state legislature created the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District in 1957 to build a rapid transit system to replace the Key System and provide region-wide rail connectivity. Initially intended to include all nine counties that ring the San Francisco Bay, the final system would feature service between San Francisco and three branches in the East Bay, serving three counties total. Passenger service on BART then began in 1972, but expansion to the system was planned almost immediately. Siemens-Duewag U2 in service on the San Diego Trolley Blue Line Environmental and traffic concerns beginning in the 1970s led to a resurgence in urban passenger rail, specifically the construction light rail networks. Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 damaged the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway Desert Line to San Diego, and the San Diego portion became an isolated railway. After prior decades of grappling with the option of building rapid transit BART-like line, light rail was eventually chosen as a more cost-effective solution. The San Diego Trolley opened in 1981 partially as a means to preserve freight service on this line, but is widely considered the system that lead to renewal in the concept of urban passenger rail. This system was followed in California by both the Sacramento Regional Transit Light Rail and Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority light rail systems in 1987, as well as more nationwide. The development of the mixed-mode Los Angeles Metro Rail began as two separate undertakings. The Southern California Rapid Transit District was planning a new subway along Wilshire Boulevard while the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission was also designing a light rail system utilizing a former Pacific Electric corridor. The light rail Blue Line opened to Long Beach in 1990. The Red rapid transit line began construction in 1986, and its first segment opened in 1993, the year both entities were merged. Expansion of the system was initially hampered by compromises and prohibiting legislation, but the light rail Green Line opened in 1995, followed by the Red Line's extension to in Koreatown (which received its own designation as the Purple Line in 2006). =Passenger rail= Amtrak era When Amtrak assumed operation of passenger rail services in the United States in 1971, most long-haul and commuter trains ceased operation. New lines were either based on previous routings or extended from old services. Service to Denver was provided via the San Francisco Zephyr (on a route largely retained from the City of San Francisco), and extended through to Chicago in 1983 with the California Zephyr. Los Angeles services have remained largely unchanged since the corporation's inception. The Southwest Chief is the successor to the ATSF Super Chief, still running from Chicago. The Sunset Limited to New Orleans is the oldest maintained named train service in the United States, inherited from the Southern Pacific service running since 1894. The Texas Eagle is a direct successor to the Missouri Pacific train of the same name. No one passenger train ran the length of the west coast before 1971. Coast Starlight service was initiated as a thrice weekly service from Seattle to San Diego, later expanded to run daily but cut back to Los Angeles by 1972. Services to Las Vegas, Nevada were provided by the weekend-only Las Vegas Limited in 1976 and long-distance Desert Wind, which operated between 1979 and 1997. Caltrans and Amtrak partnered together to form Amtrak California in 1976. The Pacific Surfliner, serving the coastal communities of Southern California between San Diego and San Luis Obispo, is an extension of the historical San Diegan that was previously operated by ATSF and continued service under Amtrak ‚Äì it is the busiest corridor outside of the Northeast. Amtrak's formation left the San Joaquin Valley without rail service, but this was rectified in 1974 with the initiation of San Joaquins service. At first serving Bakersfield to Oakland, additional services were added north to Sacramento in 1999. Capitol Corridor service began as simply Capitols in 1991 and connects the Bay Area with the Sacramento area, acting closer to true commuter rail than most other Amtrak routes. The Spirit of California was a short-haul sleeper service that ran between Los Angeles and Sacramento via the Coast Starlight routing. The train lasted under two years from 1981 to 1983. The Amtrak California branding is being deprecated as the three California-based lines have transitioned to control under local joint powers authorities. One exception The Western Pacific Railroad is a short line railroad that never joined Amtrak. For most of its existence, the line served to haul lumber from the Mendocino Coast Range to the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in Willits. The company also ran one daily round trip passenger service to Fort Bragg ‚Äì the Skunk Train. By 1996, freight shipments had declined to the point that passenger excursions became the railroad's primary source of income. A series of tunnel collapses starting in 2013 severed the line, and service was thence reduced to purely excursions without through running. Commuter rail Peninsula Commute train at Brisbane, April 1982 One service spared from discontinuance was the Southern Pacific Peninsula Commute, operational in some form since 1863. The railroad had long petitioned the California Public Utilities Commission to end the service, but remained subsidized by the state. Caltrans renamed it Caltrain in 1987. The overseeing joint powers authority acquired the line in 1991, and eventually took over responsibility for operating the service. By 1988, it was the only commuter rail being operated in the state. An attempt to start commuter rail service in Los Angeles was undertaken in 1982, although CalTrain service would last fewer than six months. Amtrak initiated Orange County Commuter service in 1990 under the San Diegans brand, but a more regional approach was deemed necessary. Southern Pacific sold of track to the newly formed Southern California Regional Rail Authority in 1991, which became the nucleus of the Metrolink commuter rail network when it opened one year later. The system would consist of six lines by the end of the millennium, including assumed operation of the Orange County service. Metrolink Antelope Valley Line running adjacent to Interstate 5, 2014 The North San Diego County Transit Development Board was created in 1975 to consolidate and improve transit in northern San Diego County. Planning began for a San Diego‚ÄìOceanside commuter rail line, then called Coast Express Rail, in 1982. The Board established the San Diego Northern Railway Corporation (SDNR) - a nonprofit operating subsidiary - in 1994, and purchased the of the Surf Line within San Diego County plus the Escondido Branch from the Santa Fe Railway that year. By the 90s, growth in the Tri-Valley and the middle Central Valley had led to congestion on local freeways while providing little access to public transit. In May 1997, the Altamont Commuter Express Joint Powers Authority was formed by the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, and Alameda Congestion Management Agency with the intent to establish commuter rail service over the Altamont Pass and Niles Canyon. The Altamont Commuter Express, connecting San Joaquin County and the Bay Area, then began operations in 1998. =Freight= Railways companies, and thus routes, were largely consolidated under a few Class I railroads by the end of the century. In 1982, the Union Pacific Corporation purchased the Western Pacific and the WP became part of a combined Union Pacific rail system: the Union Pacific Railroad, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and the Western Pacific. Southern Pacific was purchased by Union Pacific and acquisition was finalized in 1996. In the same year, the ATSF merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form BNSF Railway. With those two mergers, the two major railroads in California became Union Pacific and BNSF, with some smaller short line and switching operations. Line abandonment has generally increased since then, as redundancies are reduced. The Union Pacific line over Tehachapi Pass operates as one of the busiest single-track railways in the world. 21st century A recurring issue in California is whether the state should continue to expand its freeway network or concentrate on improving mass transit networks in urban areas. Vehicle for hire companies have gained market share from rail service. =Railway expansion= Rail systems saw initial expansion in the first decades of the century. San Diego Trolley's Green Line began service in 2005, and Silver Line heritage streetcar service began limited service in 2011 with refurbished PCC's. The Sacramento RT Light Rail extended all of its lines including one linking Folsom to the Sacramento Amtrak station, the Blue Line extension project which provided transit to several colleges in the southwest part of the city, and the line to the River District. VTA light rail also saw expansion to San Jose Diridon station and Winchester, as well as the Vasona extension. All of these systems would experience various reroutings of service as new extensions came on line. The BART station at San Francisco International Airport, which opened in 2003 Bay Area Rapid Transit has seen expansions beyond its original vision, such as the Silicon Valley BART extension, Oakland Airport Connector, and the East Contra Costa BART Extension. BART and Caltrain jointly opened Millbrae station in 2003. BART placed an order for a replacement fleet of train cars in 2012, with expected full delivery by 2022. The passage of Measure RR on November 8, 2016 gave BART the funds to undertake a massive rebuild of the system's aging infrastructure, effectively freezing expansion plans not already programmed. A result of the agency's decision to hold expansion plans into Livermore prompted the creation of the Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority in 2017 ‚Äì an agency tasked with establishing a public transit service between BART and ACE trains. San Francisco's Muni Metro has expanded service via the sequential Third Street Light Rail Project and Central Subway (with plans for a third extension underway). The heritage streetcar service was extended to Fisherman's Wharf via constructing light rail infrastructure in place of the demolished Embarcadero Freeway, and the E Embarcadero streetcar service entered regular service in 2015 providing a link between the waterfront and Caltrain. City Supervisor Scott Wiener called for sustained subway construction throughout San Francisco. LA Metro Rail's aggressive expansion policy was adopted owing to increased funding availability primarily from Measure R in 2008 and Measure M in 2016 as well as dissatisfaction with increasing automotive traffic. The Gold Line opened in 2003 and has been extended several times via East Side Expansion and the Gold Line Foothill Extension. The Expo Line opened in 2012 along the route of the former Santa Monica Air Line, was completed to Santa Monica in 2016, and hit ridership projections 13 years earlier than forecast. The Regional Connector will bring the disconnected Gold line into the rest of the LACMTA light rail system and provide more flexible service patterns. A more direct airport connection will be provided upon completion of the Crenshaw/LAX Line. Several extensions of the Purple Line are planned to bring subway service along the Wilshire / Westwood corridor and will likely connect to the Crenshaw/LAX Line. Multiple preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics are being made under the Twenty- eight by '28 initiative, including establishing a rail route over the Sepulveda Pass, the East San Fernando Valley Transit Corridor, extending the Green Line to South Bay, the West Santa Ana Branch Transit Corridor, the Inglewood Transit Connector, and the Eastside Transit Corridor extension of the Gold Line. =DMU services= Sprinter began service in 2008, connecting cities in northern San Diego County. This service follows the Escondido Branch, which was acquired by the San Diego Northern Railway in 1992 and was later transferred to the North County Transit District. The passenger trains are not FRA-compliant for operation in association with freight trains and therefore freight operations on the route are not permitted during passenger operations. For this reason the American Public Transportation Association and some publications refer to this line as light rail, but it does not conform to the normal engineering specifications usually associated with that term. SMART Nippon Sharyo DMU crossing the Haystack Landing Bridge over the Petaluma River Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit was created by state legislation in 2002 to reestablish passenger service along the Northwestern Pacific Railroad right- of-way, providing a route from Cloverdale to Larkspur Ferry Terminal with a planned 16 stations. After prolonged delays, preview service commenced on a truncated portion of the line on June 28, 2017. Construction is ongoing with plans to reach Cloverdale by 2027. Unlike trains operating the Sprinter service, SMART's Nippon Sharyo DMUs are each powered by one Cummins QSK19-R diesel engine with hydraulic transmission and regenerative braking, and meet US EPA Tier 4 emission standards. Structurally each DMU is FRA Tier 1 compliant with crash energy management features, making it capable of operating on the same line with standard North American freight trains without the need of special waivers. The aforementioned East Contra Costa BART Extension breaks from Bay Area Rapid Transit convention by using standard gauge rail (the main system uses a broad gauge), allowing for standard modern DMU trainsets to operate on the branch line. Plans originally called for trains to share right of way with pre-existing freight tracks in Eastern Contra Costa County. The freight track's owners eventually refused BART to lay tracks along its own lines, and the project was integrated into the median of an adjacent highway widening and given dedicated tracks. Its opening extended the BART system an additional with two new stations. Arrow is under construction and is planned to provide service to Redlands, California, as well as allow for connections and track sharing with Metrolink. It will run along lightly used Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway tracks and serve five stations along its route. =High-speed rail= The San Joaquin River Viaduct under construction in 2019 The California High-Speed Rail Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an rail system. It would provide a TGV-style high-speed link between the state's four major metropolitan areas, and would allow travel between Los Angeles's Union Station and the San Francisco Transbay Transit Center in two and a half hours. In November 2008, voters approved Proposition 1A, a bond measure that allocated $9 billion to finance the project. In 2012, the California legislature and Governor Jerry Brown approved financing for an initial stage of construction for the project. The High Speed Rail Authority estimates that the initial stages will not be completed until 2022. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on January 6, 2015, and construction continues despite financial and political difficulties. As part of Governor Gavin Newsom's 2019 State of the State address, he declared, \\"Right now, there simply isn‚Äôt a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego.\\" Cost increases have plagued the buildout, and in May 2019 the FRA cancelled a $928.6 million grant awarded to the project. As part of this effort, and due to rising ridership of its own, Caltrain undertook a project to electrify their service corridor between San Jose and San Francisco; high-speed rail services are expected to share this corridor once service is extended to the Bay Area. In August 2016, Caltrain awarded a contract to produce the trainsets needed for running on the electrified line, while an official groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 21, 2017 at Millbrae station. Project funding in the amount of $600 million comes from Proposition 1A funds that authorized the construction of high-speed rail. Altamont Corridor Express and San Joaquins services are planned to be enhanced and expanded as part of the state's general rail plan. CAHSR was originally to run over the Altamont Pass for its service route between the Central Valley and Silicon Valley, but these plans were later changed. New ACE lines are being built progressively to Ceres by 2023 and later to Merced. Additional services to Sacramento along a lesser- used rail line are also expected to be implemented in 2023, known as Valley Rail. Trains are planned to run to Merced and act as a feeder service in the northern section of the high speed rail service area. =Freight= By 2013, California's freight railroad system consisted of moving . Union Pacific Railroad completed a project in 2009 to allow double-stacked intermodal containers to be transported across Donner Summit, allowing for increased loads as well as train lengths. =New systems= The OC Streetcar is under construction , and will reestablish a local service along a segment of the Pacific Electric West Santa Ana Branch rail line in Santa Ana and Garden Grove. The LAX Train will connect the Los Angeles International Airport to a mass transit system for the first time when it opens in 2023. BART rejected a plan to expand the system to Livermore in 2018. This prompted the creation of the Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority, which was tasked with providing a direct rail connection between the San Joaquin Valley and the BART system. The line is expected to utilize a county-owned segment of the former Transcontinental Railroad right-of-way through Tracy and over Altamont Pass.

All three had fine lines at bow and stern, uniform frames mid-ships with concave and convex sweeps and a deep keel. Their length to beam ratio was unusually high, giving them a remarkable turn of speed. The foremast was square rigged while the other three or four masts were fore-and-aft rigged, barquentine fashion but carrying very simplified standing and running rigging. Each sail was equipped with a horizontal sprit that enabled it to be brailed up to its mast and deployed rapidly. Each mast carried three sails. The topmasts could be lowered and replaced from the deck, in the event the sprits were to fail in strong gales and had to be abandoned. The Patent granted to Gower in 1799 details his theory about the relationship between speed and the length to beam ratio, as well as details of many features of his novel form of rigging, which allowed almost all activities normally conducted aloft to be performed from the deck (including the replacement of damaged masts) ; thus only the foremast was fitted with ratlines. At the instance of John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the first Transit was sailed against HMS Osprey in 1801. Osprey was a fast sloop of 383 tons (about twice the tonnage of Transit). Built at Northfleet like a French corvette, with an 80 ft 6 in (24.5 m) keel, she had the reputation of being very fast. Her length to beam ratio (at waterline) was probably less than 3:1. Transit with a length of 130 feet (39.6 m) and a length to beam ratio of 6.5:1 performed so well as to have been acknowledged the winner by the captain of Osprey. Despite this success Gower failed to get the support he needed to build a class of vessels to his patents. The reasons given for the rejection of Gower's proposal included the observation that because of her deep keel she would fall over at low tide in many of the east coast ports from which she might have to operate and that the deck was so narrow that guns could not be arranged symmetrically on each side for fear of their recoil causing them to collide. By coincidence, but apparently unbeknownst to Gower, the very gun that he would have needed, the carronade, a short barrelled gun mounted on a slide fixed to the deck, was adopted by the Royal Navy less than a year before the test of Transit. Gower wrote detailed and vivid accounts of the vessels and his experiences with the authorities. George Bayley, owner of the yard that built two of the Transits also gave an account of the vessels. Macgregor gives a description and illustration of the first Transit. References *Gower, R. H. (1799).

The lip in this genus is unique in the family. It is hinged and has a mechanism that snaps shut when stimulated by a pollinator, thus trapping the insect to ensure that the pollinia will be removed and later transferred to the receptive surface. The lip opens after 30 minutes or so to release the insect, but also closes at night and reopens at dawn. left Species Species accepted as of June 2014: #Porroglossum actrix Luer & R.Escobar #Porroglossum adrianae Luer & Sijm #Porroglossum agile Luer #Porroglossum amethystinum (Rchb.f.)

The city is also the seat of the county Morona. Known as the \\"Emerald of the East\\" due to its location east of the Andes mountains, Macas lies in the Upano Valley overlooking the Upano river. The city has a population of 14,054 inhabitants and along with Tena and Puyo served under Spanish rule as one of Ecuador's main staging points for the colonization of the Amazon and the subjugation of its indigenous peoples. Beginning in the 1960s indigenous people have organized political federations and movements, and often locate the seats of their organizations in such cities and use them as central places for regional congresses. Macas has also been promoting tourism.Macas' Tourist Website The city is an important agricultural and livestock raising center as well as a transportation hub for small jungle communities to the east. Types of agricultural products found here include yuca, sugarcane, papaya, coffee, and bananas.The Columbia Gazetteer of the World New York: Columbia University (1998) In recent years, Macas also developed a small tourism industry based on jungle trekking, trips to indigenous communities, and extreme sports like rafting. Macas is linked by road to Puyo in the north and Riobamba to the west. History The name Macas comes from the Macas Indians who were thought to have inhabited a large portion of what is now the Ecuadorian section of the Amazon basin. The name 'Sevilla del Oro' was first used in 1538 when the area was first founded by Spanish captain Juan Villanueva Maldonado.Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names 3 August 2009 It was later renamed 'Macas' and refounded in 1599. For many years, the city of Macas lay on the boundary of the province of Chimborazo. In 1929, Macas became the capital of the province of Morona Santiago. Culture Further afield from Macas lies the territory of the Shuar and Macabea cultures, indigenous peoples that have inhabited the region for hundreds of years. Macas offers a good starting point for exploring these cultures, although this is usually best done through a guide. In the city itself, there are many handicraft makers and artisans, providing a much needed boost to the local economy. The gastronomy of Macas relies heavily on fish and chicken. The city itself boasts many restaurants from seafood to Chinese cuisine.

Designed as assembly rooms, the building is situated on Mount Pleasant, close to Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The building has been closed since 1997 and is currently subject to emergency repair work to preserve it for future use. History The Neo-classical building was designed by the architect Edmund Aikin and built between 1815-16 as a subscription assembly room for the Wellington Club. It was originally used by high society for assemblies, dance balls and parties. The Wellington Club was wound up in 1922. Between 1923 and 1940 it was the Embassy Club and was used for tea dances, classes and weddings. During WW2, the building became the first base for the Rodney Youth Centre though bomb damage in 1941 damaged all of the original ceilings with the exception of the ballroom. The building officially opened as Liverpool Irish Centre on 1 February 1965 hosting ceilis, music, drama performances as well as serving as a base for clubs and societies. The Irish Centre relocated in the 1990s, and the building became derelict. Architecture The building was designed with a central entrance that leads into an octagonal room from which three further rooms can be accessed. These were originally used as a drawing room, refreshment room and ballroom. The building had three separate entrances which were intended for men, ladies and sedan-chairs & carriages. The Wellington Rooms were designated a listed building (Grade II*) in the 1950s, but this official protection did not prevent the property becoming derelict after the Irish Centre closed in 1997. Current status and proposed regeneration The building was placed on the national Heritage at Risk Register in 1999, and has been one the sites featured in the Liverpool Echo's Stop the Rot campaign. The building suffers from dry rot, dampness and loss of plaster from walls and ceiling which has been exacerbated by repeated lead theft from the roof. Plans were announced in 2016 to turn the building into a Science and Technology Hub as part of the Knowledge Quarter plans. Emergency repairs were approved in November 2016 with the work intended to be started in February 2017. ¬£121,000 was to be spent repairing the roof and walls to prevent water getting into the building with half the money coming from Liverpool City Council and half from Historic England. In October 2017, the Liverpool Echo reported that the awarding of the tender for the restoration work had been delayed from February and was hoped to be awarded that month. ¬£100,000 of emergency works began in February 2018. The works aim to survey the roof with a view to making the building watertight so that further restoration work can be carried out at a later date. A public consultation was launched in March 2018 to hear suggestions from local people for future uses for the building.

Its members were Syd Barrett on guitar, Twink on drums, and Jack Monck on bass.Staff. \\"*Stars* At Cambridge.\\" Terrapin (January 1973) Beginnings After a spell in Morocco, Twink (ex- Pink Fairies) moved to Cambridge and worked with the 'Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band', initially with vocalist/guitarist Bruce Michael Paine (ex-Apple Pie & star of the San Francisco production of 'Hair') and John 'Honk' Lodge (Junior's Eyes, Quiver) playing bass. The Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band, now with ex-Delivery bass player Jack Monck, backed American Blues guitarist Eddie \\"Guitar\\" Burns at King's College Cellar on 26 January 1972. Jack's wife Jenny Spires, a friend of Twink's and former girlfriend of Syd Barrett (ex-Pink Floyd), went with Syd down to the gig and he brought his guitar along and jammed with them in the last set. At the \\"Six Hour Technicolor Dream\\" at the Cambridge Corn Exchange the next day (27 January), the Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band, with guests Fred Frith and Syd Barrett, played on a bill with Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies. The Boogie Band played five tracks before being joined on stage by Syd for a further three. Within the next day or two Jenny, Jack & Twink said 'wouldn't it be great to get Syd playing again'. Twink recalled: This gig was recorded, and while one mastertape was confiscated by EMI in 1985, another copy surfaced in 2005. In June 2010 this tape was offered for auction but failed to reach its reserve price. It was then purchased by the Easy Action label, who also hold the tapes of the Pink Fairies and Hawkwind sets from the same show. Easy Action released the Hawkwind set as an album licensed from EMI Music in 2012, and released the Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band tape as an album entitled Six Hour Technicolor Dream in June 2014. Performances All 'Stars' performances contained Barrett-era Pink Floyd songs and tracks from Barrett's 1970 solo albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett. The posters for the MC5 / Skin Alley gig also billed an appearance from a new line-up of the Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band - Bruce Paine, Rick Fenn, Bill Gray & Gary Luvaglia. Paine went on to join Steamhammer for a tour of Europe in late 1972 before returning to the United States. Stars roadie and occasional bass player Joly MacFie said: Hollingworth wrote: Jack Monck, speaking in 2001, agreed that the gig was below-par: The Terrapin fanzine was more charitable in its review of what it called Syd's Final Performance (January 1973). The damage had already been done when Barrett read the Melody Maker review the following week, despite Joly's assertion that the Cambridge Corn Exchange gig with Nektar, two days later, was an improvement - a claim which Twink seemed to back up: Guitarist Bernie Elliott was the musician recruited for the Syd-less Stars gigs, alternatively recalled as having been at Seymour Hall in London.Oxford, Essex Uni. At some point during 1972, Twink, Monck, Dan Kelleher (guitar/keyboards) and George Bacon (guitar) completed a recording session at London's Polydor Studios, with one song later surfacing on a 1991 compilation album.Twink - Odds & Beginnings LP (Twink Records, 1991) In late 1972, Monck started a new band called Rocks Off with Rusty Burnhill. Aftermath Shortly thereafter Syd Barrett left music and his public life altogether and began living in seclusion, but not before Syd performed with Jack Bruce in Cambridge during the Summer of 1973. A night of poetry and music was arranged by Bruce and his writing partner Pete Brown, and when Brown arrived at the gig (having been delayed) he found Bruce jamming with local musicians, one of whom he recalled was playing acoustic jazz guitar. When Brown started his poetry reading, he dedicated one to Syd Barrett, stating that he started the Psychedelic movement in England‚Äîonly to then see the man with the guitar stand up and say, \\"No I didn't.\\" Brown only then realized this was Barrett himself. This appears to be the last time he ever performed in public. Recordings of Stars performances were made but remain lost. American photographer Victor Kraft is known to have recorded (and photographed) the Dandelion gigs, but after his death in 1976 his possessions were removed from his flat by his Cambridge landlord. As mentioned above, the concert with Nektar was recorded but the tapes were lost, although the Boogie Band show with Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies still exists, and a recording of the Eddie \\"Guitar\\" Burns gig is also rumoured to have survived. Twink also claimed that Syd had recorded all of their rehearsals on cassette and kept the tapes, but their fate is unknown. Roy Hollingworth, told of the cause of Stars' breakup several years later, was deeply upset. \\"It was never my intention to harm Syd because I was his biggest fan. He was one of my heroes. I wrote about what I saw and heard as sensitively as I could and it certainly wasn't meant to be a big put down. A little piece of me died that night too. But on a personal level if it hurt Syd I'm very sorry.

In July 2006 President Ch√°vez announced that the Mission Ribas should become a socio- political movement conformed by students, family members and professors to guarantee its role as a promoting agent of the Bolivarian revolution. There have been many concerns about the effectiveness of this and other missions lately. Even Ch√°vez has expressed worry about the high number of people who drop out of school or do not continue to the Mision Sucre, or Higher Education. The pro-government deputy Pastora Medina admitted that \\"there are denunciations about the way scholarships are given. There is little commitment from the pupils and the teachers of the Misi√≥n Ribas and this has led to a wrong development. In the Caricuao area, in Caracas, there are 300 pupils registered, but only eight go to classes\\". Funding The state-owned Petr√≥leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) is a large contributor to Mission Ribas. In 2009, US$2.1 billion were allocated to the mission, which according to PDVSA were \\"resources that have resulted in the issuance of 159,749 scholarships\\" and helped 632,623 Venezuelans earn \\"the title of Bachelor of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\". In a 2007 New York Times article, it was reported that \\"most of the students also receive stipends of $85 a month to attend\\" and that \\"the students themselves choose who gets the stipends, based on need and dedication\\".  Ideology teaching  Mission Ribas officials stated that \\"Political and ideological training ... is the top qualification for a facilitator\\".

Finkbeiner (born May 30, 1939, in Toledo, Ohio) is a Democratic politician and former mayor of Toledo, Ohio. First elected in 1993, he took office on January 1, 1994. In 1997, he defeated challenger Nick Wichowski to win a second term. Term limits prevented him from running a third consecutive time. He was succeeded by former mayor Jack Ford in 2002. Following his first administration, Finkbeiner served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board. He joined the ABC affiliate in Toledo and hosted Carty & Company, a Sunday morning public affairs show. He also contributed a weekly editorial segment, It's Just Not Right! Finkbeiner left WTVG in May 2005. On June 30, 2005, Finkbeiner announced that he would seek a third term as mayor. He won the Toledo mayoral primary, winning roughly 37% of the vote in comparison to 29% earned by incumbent Ford. On November 8, 2005, Finkbeiner was re-elected mayor. Finkbeiner was sworn in for his third term as mayor in a private ceremony on January 3, 2006. Carty announced that his third run as mayor would be his final one and he would not seek re-election. According to city finance records verified by the Toledo Blade Finkbeiner left the city with a 48 million dollar deficit which was inherited by Ohio Fire Marshall Michael P. Bell, an Independent, who succeeded Carty Finkbiener in 2010. Finkbeiner resides with his wife, Amy Finkbeiner, in South Toledo. He has three children: Ryan, Jenny, and Katie, and five grandchildren. Carlton Finkbeiner announced plans to run for a fourth term as mayor of Toledo on August 29, 2015. Background Finkbeiner was born in 1939 and raised in Toledo. He graduated from Maumee Valley Country Day School and received a B.A. from Denison University in Granville. Prior to his political career, he taught at Maumee Valley Country Day School, St. Francis de Sales High School, and the University of Toledo. During his long career in public service, Carty has been a member of multiple parties. At various times and for various offices he has run as a Republican, a Democrat and an Independent. Finkbeiner served eight years as a city councilman and two years as deputy mayor.  Controversy  Several controversies have occurred during Finkbeiner's involvement in public office: * In November 1994, Mayor Carty Finkbeiner suggested at a staff meeting that a way to resolve complaints about airport noise would be to move deaf people into the neighborhood. * Toledo restaurateur John Skiadas filed a lawsuit alleging that Finkbeiner physically and verbally assaulted him at the Erie Street Market in 2000. The lawsuit was dismissed by Lucas County Common Pleas Judge Charles Wittenberg in 2004. *In March, 1999, Finkbeiner called for a boycott of Little Caesar's Pizza because of the franchise owners‚Äô involvement in a proposed Rossford sports arena. Some Little Caesar's stores renamed their Crazy Bread ‚ÄúCarty Bread‚Äù. *In 1997, the Finkbeiner Administration negotiated to convert the Beacon Place Apartments, an apartment complex in the Warren-Sherman neighborhood near downtown Toledo, into condominiums. Despite assurances from Finkbeiner's housing commissioner, James Thurston, that the city would not be held financially responsible for the project, the project collapsed because the Finkbeiner Administration failed to clear the sale of the properties with the federal government, which had financed the apartments. Toledo taxpayers lost $230,000 and could have paid more than $2.3 million. Thurston and Edwin Bergsmark (CEO of Cavista Corporation, the owner of the Beacon Place Apartments) were both convicted in this scandal. * He plagiarized a single line in his KICK-OFF speech in 1998. * In early 2006, political adversaries scoffed over the mayor spending $9,996 of city money to complete the installation of shower facilities in his city government building office. The project was considered \\"controversial\\" in part because the shower quote was originally $10,006, six dollars over a threshold that requires approval from City Council. The contractor was able to shave $10 from the project, thus avoiding a Council vote on the proposal. * In May 2006, he called Toledo's African American Fire Chief Michael Bell \\"King Kong\\" at a staff meeting. Finkbeiner later clarified his remarks as relating to the Chief's physical stature, and Chief Bell has acknowledged in public that he took no offense to the remarks. * In June 2006, Jack Smith resigned from his brief tenure as Chief of Police after what he described as a near-physical confrontation with the mayor after they exchanged words. * In February 2008, Finkbeiner refused to let a company of 200 Marine Corps Reservists engage in urban patrol exercises on the streets of downtown as well as inside the mostly vacant Madison Building, 607 Madison Ave. Toledo police knew about the event three days in advance, but it wasn't until the Marines arrived that \\"the mayor asked them to leave because they frighten people\\", said Brian Schwartz, the mayor's spokesman. Finkbeiner defended his decision to cancel the exercise, but in an e-mail to Marine Corps officials, he expressed support for the Marines and the military and invited the Marine unit to return to Toledo for training, but not downtown. In reaction to the uproar, Finkbeiner has offered conflicting explanations for his denial. During a radio interview on The Frank Beckmann Show on WJR-760 AM in Detroit on Tuesday, Feb. 12th, Finkbeiner used profanity to describe the situation he caused as a \\"fucking ruckus\\". *In summer 2008, Finkbeiner spent nearly $80,000 of taxpayer money (without City Council approval) to renovate Bay 4 the Erie Street Market into a concert venue. According to the City Charter, the mayor may spend up to $10,000 without City Council approval. Finkbeiner broke the nearly $80,000 into 13 separate contracts under $10,000 to circumvent council's approval. Moreover, Finkbeiner tapped a local concert promoter, Rob Croak, to schedule events at the Erie Street Market. Croak was convicted on one count of forgery and has been arrested for but not convicted of underage alcohol sales, according to court records. The forgery conviction stems from a 2001 accusation that Croak falsified records to obtain a liquor permit. Also, Croak owes thousands of dollars in back state and federal taxes. * In 2009, Take Back Toledo (a group of Toledo area businessmen whose goal is to foster a pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-economic development climate in Northwestern Ohio) led a campaign to recall Finkbeiner from office. On April 15, the Lucas County Board of Elections validated 20,400 signature, enough to recall Finkbeiner. On April 20, Clerk of Council Jerry Dendinger hand-delivered a recall notice to Finkbeiner. According to the City Charter, Finkbeiner had five days to resign or face a recall vote on the November election. Finkbeiner refused to resign and hired a law firm to contest the validity of the recall petition signatures. The Supreme Court of Ohio ultimately ruled that due to missing language in the recall petition, that it was invalid. * In June 2009, Finkbeiner supported the $25 parking tickets issued by the Division of Streets, Bridges, and Harbor to residents for parking in their own driveways. He claimed the tickets were given due to a city law that prohibits parking on unpaved surfaces, which includes gravel driveways. Two major problems with the tickets were that the city law that had not been enforced for about 50 years was now suddenly being enforced without warning and that according to the Toledo City Charter only the Toledo Police Dept can issue tickets for parking, traffic, etc. and not representatives of other city agencies. Despite criticism, Finkbeiner ignored a press question asking if the fines were related to the city's financial woes. *In June 2009, a video surfaced showing Finkbeiner breaking up a fight in Highland Park, calling one boy \\"fatso\\", \\"tubby\\", and \\"fat ass\\".

Piled Higher and Deeper (also known as PhD Comics), is a newspaper and webcomic strip written and drawn by Jorge Cham that follows the lives of several grad students. First published in 1997 when Cham was a grad student himself at Stanford University, the strip deals with issues of life in graduate school, including the difficulties of scientific research, the perils of procrastination, and the complex student‚Äìsupervisor relationship. As of 2017, the strip's website received 6 million visitors each year.  History  Piled Higher and Deeper was first published in The Stanford Daily, the student newspaper at Stanford University, in October 1997. The newspaper had put out a call for comics and Cham, a student and teaching assistant at the time, discussed ideas for comics with his brother and friends. Cham's brother, Jaime, suggested there should be a comic about grad school \\"because that's when the real pain begins\\". Cham had no formal art training and had never tried drawing comics before but his comic was accepted. Cham created the website a few weeks later. Cham continued the strip while completing his PhD and while as an instructor in mechanical engineering at Caltech, then in July 2005, left this work to become a full-time cartoonist. Originally, the strip was drawn in black-and-white, eventually became grayscale, and finally became color in June 2004. The strip is free online and is also syndicated free to student newspapers, with Cham earning a living through book sales, merchandise, and giving lectures.  Themes  The title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a Ph.D., which explains that \\"B.S.\\" stands for \\"bullshit\\", \\"M.S.\\" stands for \\"More of the Same\\" (or \\"More Shit\\"), and \\"Ph.D.\\" stands for \\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\". The comic follows the lives of graduate students and their professors. Reviewer Sara Coelho said \\"the comic deals with everyday frustrations of life in the lab ‚Äì procrastination, dealing with advisers, serving on committees, lack of inspiration\\". Comics deal with the isolation of graduate work. Cham's comics have also been on real-world research, such as a five-comic series following a visit to CERN. Characters Piled Higher and Deeper introduced its main characters early in its run, and their personalities have remained fairly constant during the strip's several years of publication. In the strip's first few seasons, the characters were clearly Stanford University students, though the number of school-specific references and jokes has decreased since. Cham has said that while the character are not based on real people, he was inspired by colleagues, classmates, and his brother's friends. =Students= * The Nameless Grad Student (a.k.a., The Nameless Hero) ‚Äì a graduate student in engineering, this bespectacled protagonist has procrastinated through the entire strip without receiving a name. He looks similar to comic strip author, Jorge Cham and is modelled after him (at one point, his younger sister Dee remarks that her brother has dreams of quitting grad school and becoming a cartoonist). Cham chose to make the character nameless as \\"when you're a graduate student, professors never remember your name.\\" Little is known about the hero's background, although early on Mike Slackenerny states that he knew the hero's older brother (who quit his PhD and went on to work for a \\"Silicon Valley Company\\"). As he is seen playing with two children at home during his winter vacation,; he probably has younger siblings, nieces and/or nephews, or cousins. He has been increasingly seen with a set group of friends (one is named Mikkel)) and seems, at least marginally, to be the most favored graduate student of his advisor, Prof. Smith. At the conclusion of the film, the character states for the first time that his name is Winston, named after Jorge's father; in the films, Winston is a biochemistry grad student. * Cecilia ‚Äì A geeky engineering student born around May 1, 1980Cecilia turned 25 in 2005: ; Cham, Scooped!, p. 12. though earlier strips have her born in 1973.Cecilia went to her 10 year high school reunion in 2001: ; Cham, Scooped!, p. 12. Cecilia spent years refusing to admit that she was truly a geek at heart. However, in one strip she finally with hesitation admitted she is indeed a geek. She is also a programmer as well. Addicted to chocolate and cookies, she has long since taken enough classes and conducted enough research to graduate, but a mysterious psychological force keeps her in school. She stated in an interview for a project by her friend Tajel that her father was a professor, a \\"great teacher\\", something that may or may not be a motivation for her to go above and beyond (also, her choice of words indicates that her father may have died). During class, she deliberately wears frumpy clothes to discourage male interest, since the vast majority of her classmates are men. This strategy is not always successful ‚Äì \\"Excuse me, female, will you marry me?\\"; Cham, Scooped!, p. 14. She has had two boyfriends in the course of the strip: David and Scott. Although she broke up with David relatively quickly, she seriously dated Scott, her crush in high school, for numerous strips;; Cham, Scooped!, p. 67. they had a long-distance relationship for a while after Scott was promoted and moved to London; Cham, Scooped!, p. 69. but broke up amicably in 2007.; Cham, Scooped!, p. 130. Cecilia sometimes accompanies Tajel to political rallies and such events. She was asked in 2006 by a professor to interview for a faculty position at a different institution because \\"it's the only position you're not overqualified for\\"; Cham, Scooped!, p. 53. and \\"we hired one of their grad students, so, diplomatically, they owe us.\\"; Cham, Scooped!, p. 53. * Michael Slackenerny ‚Äì phenomenally lazy, endlessly devious, and remarkably clever, Mike did his undergraduate at Berkeley yet had been in graduate school for longer than anyone can remember (during one of his interviews it was strongly implied that he started grad school in the 1980s), surviving on ramen and free food from various events on campus. He views grad school not as a place but as \\"a state of mind [...] preferably sleeping\\". In the spring of 1998, he drove to Las Vegas with a seemingly foolproof plan to beat the blackjack tables, thereby winning enough money to solve Stanford's housing crisis. Instead, he returned with a wife, Jen, who remained an unseen character for some time. Jen became pregnant with their daughter Sophy; Cham, Scooped!, p. 51. and stayed that way for several years, constantly urging Michael to finish his thesis and graduate. Michael finally completed his doctoral defense in 2005 ‚Äì Jen went into labor just before his presentation began ‚Äì but did not finish writing his thesis until 2007. After submitting his dissertation, Mike was seen walking home and asking himself, \\"Now what?\\"; Cham, Scooped!, p. 131. After a period of job-hunting, he was finally hired by Prof. Smith as a postdoc. * Tajel ‚Äì an anthropologist and the lone social scientist in the main cast. She was Cecilia's roommate before she got married. She is a dedicated activist who frequently attends or organizes rallies. Her frustration with American politics is exacerbated by her not being a United States citizen. She is conversant in Spanish. Her mother is Indian and her father is Caucasian. She married Dr. Khumalo in February 2009. * Gerard ‚Äì the strip's newest \\"official\\" character, he is a major in Medieval Scandinavian Cultural Philosophy, who was personally introduced to readers by Tajel, supposedly in response to numerous letters from Humanities majors requesting their own character, and was meant to provide jokes on \\"obscure manuscripts, dead languages, and being the lowest paid grads on campus. Also, political correctness!\\" Despite this, Gerard has only been shown twice after his initial introduction, apart from a cameo as a guest at Tajel's wedding, in a joke on the obscurity and uselessness of his field. His first actual storyline within the comic occurs when he is informed that funding has been cut for humanities majors and to leave the strip or find a more useful major, subsequently forcing him to justify why the comic should retain a humanities character. * Dee ‚Äì the hero's younger sister. She is an undergraduate student who has been seen taking the GRE. She also talks on her cellular telephone, eats quite a bit, and naps during class when she isn't doing something even more inappropriate, such as chatting or eating a full meal during a test. Dee once phones her \\"sister dearest\\", so the main character may have more than one sibling. Dee has a good male friend who she often spends time with and at one point hints that he may have romantic feelings for her. Like the main character, he has not yet been named. * Mariko ‚Äì a Japanese student in the same research field as the hero, she visits Prof. Smith's lab in 1998. Smith assigns her to work with \\"whoever is lowest in the lab hierarchy\\", which turns out to be the hero. During her brief stay, she inspires in him a powerful unrequited affection, which he maintains for at least three years. She eventually quits her Ph.D. and starts her own company, at which the hero works briefly. She is still occasionally seen talking with the main character as he works, so her current status is somewhat murky. On a strip dated 28 April 2010, entitled \\"Lost no more..?\\", she was seen in an alternate timeline as possibly being the mother of the Nameless Hero's (supposed) baby, with the Nameless Hero asking \\"WHAT IF I HAD STAYED IN ACADEMIA?\\" * Steve (aka. Golden Boy) ‚Äì Remarkably clever, sincere and \\"good boy\\". Steve has been in graduate school for two years and has already completed his thesis. In the lab hierarchy he is given more consideration than any of the post docs or research associates by Prof. Smith. He is extremely good in getting positive results and is always consulted by Prof. Smith for his opinion. His \\"good boy\\" image in comparison to the nameless hero is a running joke in the series. * Allison ‚Äì The sole female PhD student in Professor Smith's lab, which Smith and the other PhDs often forget to Allison's frustration. Unlike her labmates, she is not distracted by sporting events like the World Cup and proves to have some measure of athletic ability during the students vs. professors baseball match. =Faculty= * Professor Jones ‚Äì Cecilia's research advisor; a typical graduate school professor, although seemingly older and kinder than Prof. Smith. He is clueless in giving Cecilia advice on non-research related topics such as her lovelife and future career and will ask for her help with small tasks, such as changing the font size of footnotes, while claiming it is urgent. Apparently the only reason he has time to see his wife is because he married his administrative assistant; before he received tenure, he had already been divorced three times. He has a daughter in 1st grade named Shelley,; Cham, Scooped!, p. 20. who is intelligent enough to fix Mike's work for him. * Dr. Patrick Khumalo ‚Äì An adjunct professor in the Anthropology Department's faculty, who Tajel eventually marries. Tajel mistakes him for a first-year grad student when they first meet, possibly because she is older than he is. * Professor Rivera ‚Äì Tajel's advisor. He apparently takes a laid-back approach to being an advisor, being entirely clueless as to Tajel's research interests, progress, and sometimes even her name. Once he praised a draft of a paper that Tajel had written, three months after Tajel had already submitted the final paper on due date. Additionally, he is extremely elusive when needed, such as when Cecilia needed to find him for documents to allow Tajel to renew her visa, appearing only when Cecilia tried imagining he was the last person she wanted to see. He is married to Professor Stein, the chair of the anthropology department. Despite being aware that he lacks any apparent interest in Tajel's work, she is still stunned when he leaves for a position at another university with only an offer of advising her remotely. * Professor Galvez - The head of the anthropology department, who becomes Tajel's new advisor after discussion with the rest of the faculty. In contrast to Rivera, Galvez apparently has a surly personality and finds Tajel's emails to be too lengthy to bother reading. * Professor Brian S. SmithThe fact that his first name is Brian is reflected in and ; Cham, Scooped!, p. 45. ‚Äì Mostly intimidating and unsympathetic but sometimes forgetful, Prof. Smith advises Mike Slackenerny and the Nameless Hero in their research, taking credit for any output his lab actually produces. Prof. Smith occasionally tries to \\"fit in\\" with his students (nearly all males and one female student, Allison ), to humorous and awkward results. He has a wife and two children, a daughter named Sadie, and a son, \\"Junior\\".; Cham, Scooped!, p. 81. However, as a grad student, Prof. Smith (then known simply as \\"Brian\\") fell in love with a fellow grad student in the same lab, Sangeeta Singh, whose work he greatly admired. Tragically, Brian ignored Sangeeta's advances in order to work overtime on his thesis, even turning down her invitation to a holiday party. Prof. Smith regretted it for the rest of his life, consoling himself many years later by saying to himself, \\"who cares, I've got tenure\\". The second PhD Movie elaborates on this further, showing Sangeeta's fate after young Brian stupidly missed the opportunity of a lifetime with her: decades later, Sangeeta is a professor herself and one of Prof. Smith's leading rivals in his field. But even then, it is clear that Prof. Smith never got over her. When she encounters him at a scientific conference, taunting his work, he has no wits to reply and can only stare longingly at her, until she finally snaps him out of his trance. It is unclear whether she still harbors a buried affection for him in return. Prof. Smith's current wife presumably hopes not. Prof. Smith was originally drawn so that his face was never seen, much like Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the early James Bond movies, Doctor Claw in Inspector Gadget, or any teacher/adult in Peanuts. According to his wife, Smith apparently \\"used to goof off all the time as a grad student\\" and it has been suggested on occasion that he had been interested in becoming a circus performer rather than a professor. A brilliant academic who disproved all the theories of his advisor Professor Emeritus Zekowsky,; Cham, Scooped!, p. 43. Professor Smith is the Arthur C. and Caroline J. McCallister Distinguished Chair Professor and Anderson Faculty Scholar, and the Director of the Center for Computational Research and the National Institute of Dynamical Physics. He is the recipient of the Alexander von Humboldt Prize of the Netherlands, the National Science Foundation Presidential Investigator Award, the Exceptional Achievement Medal from the International Society of Engineers, the Pi Gamma Tau Industry Excellence Professorship, the National Medal of Engineering, and the Medal of Honor from the Royal Academy of Scientists. He serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Advanced Dynamics, the Journal of Nano-Particle Computation, Physik-Publication and several other journals, and on the advisory boards of many industry consortia. He holds honorary doctorates from the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, Tsing-Chua Beijing University and the Universidade de S√£o Paulo, among others.; Cham, Scooped!, p. 85. * Professor Sangeeta Singh ‚Äì Prof. Smith's ex-labmate when he was a grad student himself, and now his greatest rival, Prof. Singh is featured solely in \\"The PHD Movie 2\\", although she was seen in Prof. Smith's flashbacks during the \\"A Smithmas Carol\\" storyline. Parodies Jorge Cham after his \\"Power of Procrastination\\" talk at UIUC, March 8, 2007 One of Cham's recurring themes is to re-cast an item of popular culture in the grad-school milieu. Upon several occasions, the strip has included spoofs of popular movies, like The Thesis (The Matrix), Raiders of the Lost Dissertation (Raiders of the Lost Ark), I, Grad Student (a mixture of the book and movie I, Robot), and Summer days (\\"Summer Nights\\"). In addition, Cham has parodied television programs like The Jerry Springer Show, among others. Jorge Cham has also parodied Newton's laws of motion as Newton's 3 Laws of Graduation. According to the strip these laws of graduation were superseded by Einstein's Special Theory of Research Inactivity, much as Newton's actual laws were superseded by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. Another series of strips takes up the modern debate about the proper use of the term \\"irony\\". The strip has also included several adaptations of Shakespeare as well as several propaganda posters. Captions for the latter include \\"This man does research for you!\\", \\"When you procrastinate... Someone is watching!\\" and \\"Women in grad school... Support your local female geek.\\" Cham has also released two song parodies, purportedly sung by Tajel, in MP3 format: \\"Closer to fine\\" (cf. Indigo Girls) and \\"Who will grade your work\\" (Who Will Save Your Soul).  Reception  The comic resonates with graduate students. As of 2011, the strip's website received 7 million visitors each year,, and a 2017 article reported that it received 6 million visitors a year. As of 2009, Cham had sold more than 46,000 books. Books Six PhD comic books have been published so far. These are collections of the PHD Comic strips, and some books also contain bonus material: * Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Comic Strip Collection (2002), contains production sketches and an afterword by the character Prof. Smith in addition to the comic strips. * Life is Tough and then You Graduate (2005) contains six strips not published online that explain what happened in Mike's thesis defense. It also has a foreword by Karl Marx, behind-the-scenes author notes and a graduate school board game. * Scooped! (2007) also contains \\"Tales from the Road\\", a series of comics that detail Cham's experiences whilst giving his Power of Procrastination tour. * Academic Stimulus Package (2009) was printed in full color. * Adventures in Thesisland (2012) was also printed in full color. The introduction is an excerpt from the screenplay of the PHD Movie. * The PHD Comics 20th Anniversary Collection (2019) includes essays by Cham. Movie adaptations = The PHD Movie = In March 2011, Jorge Cham started filming a movie based on the comic series. The film production was a collaboration between Cham and a theater group at the California Institute of Technology. In fall 2011, the film was released on selected academic campuses. A trailer of the movie was released to the Piled Higher and Deeper website on June 8, 2011. After about a year of various campus screenings around the world, the movie became available for purchase on DVD or streaming on April 15, 2012. A columnist for Nature wrote: \\"the film puts the plight of the PhD student on the big screen, giving student audiences a chance to laugh at themselves... the film tackles some of the negative aspects of pursuing a PhD and a science career... The PhD Movie raises a question that crosses many students' minds: why bother? The answer it provides resonates with the audience: Everybody is here because they want to be here ... You have to embrace the things you're passionate about.'\\" = The PHD Movie 2: Still in Grad School = The sequel to the first movie was shot in the Caltech campus.

The original programme was drawn up by John Muirhead and published in Erdmann's History of Philosophy in 1890. This statement was published in slightly altered form in subsequent volumes: :\\"The Muirhead Library of Philosophy was designed as a contribution to the History of Modern Philosophy under the heads: first of Different Schools of Thought ‚Äî Sensationalist, Realist, idealist, Intuitivist; secondly of different Subjects ‚Äî Psychology, Ethics, Political Philosophy, Theology. While much had been done in England in tracing the course of evolution in nature, history, economics, morals and religion, little had been done in tracing the development of thought on these subjects. Yet 'the evolution of opinion is part of the whole evolution'.\\"George Edward Moore, Commonplace Book, 1919-1953, Vol. 16, London: Routledge, 2002 (reprint) (Muirhead Library of Philosophy), publisher's advertisement in final page. The Muirhead Library of Philosophy was originally published by Allen & Unwin and continued through to the 1970s. The series has since slipped from view with the waning of the influence of some of the published philosophers. However, the importance of this series can be judged by the list of masterpieces in Frank Magill's World Masterpieces of Philosophy in Digest Form (1952-75) which included many of the works from this series in its overview of twentieth century philosophy.

Biography George MacBeth was born in Shotts, Lanarkshire, Scotland. When he was three, his family moved to Sheffield in England. He was educated in Sheffield at King Edward VII School where he was Head Prefect in 1951 (photo), before going up to New College, Oxford, with an Open Scholarship in Classics. He joined BBC Radio on graduating in 1955 from the University of Oxford. He worked there, as a producer of programmes on poetry, notably for the BBC Third Programme, until 1976. He was a member of The Group. He resigned from the BBC to take up novel-writing; he introduced a series of thrillers involving the spy, Cadbury. In his later post-BBC years, after divorcing his first wife, he married the novelist Lisa St Aubin de Ter√°n, with whom he had a child, Alexander Morton George MacBeth. After a divorce, he moved with his new wife, Penny, to Ireland to live at Moyne Park, Abbeyknockmoy, near Tuam in County Galway. A few months later, George MacBeth was diagnosed as suffering from motor neurone disease, of which he died in early 1992. In the last poetry he wrote, MacBeth provides an anatomy of a cruel disease and the destruction it caused two people deeply in love. Penny and George had two children, Diana (\\"Lally\\") Francesca Ronchetti MacBeth and George Edward Morton Mann MacBeth. Poems from Oby (1982) was a Choice of the Poetry Book Society. He wrote the compilation whilst living at The Old Rectory, Oby; Oby is a Norfolk hamlet. He received a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for his work. MacBeth died in Tuam, County Galway, Ireland.

The name is Scots stock brig from Anglic stocc brycg, meaning a timber bridge. Originally a small outlying village, it was incorporated into the City of Edinburgh in the 19th century. The current \\"Stock Bridge\\", built in 1801, is a stone structure spanning the Water of Leith. The painter Henry Raeburn (1756‚Äì1823) owned two adjoining estates, Deanhaugh and St Bernard's, which he developed with the assistance of the architect James Milne. Milne was also responsible for the fine St Bernard's Church (1823) in Saxe Coburg Street. Ann Street, designed by Raeburn and named after his wife, is a rare early example of a New Town street with private front gardens. Notable streets and buildings St. Stephen's Church The eastern route into Stockbridge is marked by the local landmark, St Stephen's Church. This stands at the north end of St Vincent Street, its tower visible from the first New Town on the higher slope to the south. Originally intended to stand in the centre of Circus Place, it was redesigned and squeezed into its current restricted site on ground which falls sharply at the southern edge of the Silvermills area. It was designed by the architect William Playfair in 1827. It is unusual for its main church being raised by a storey, accessed by a tall but relatively narrow flight of steps at its frontage. Its clock pendulum is the longest in Europe. The church stands at the eastern end of St Stephen Street, a curving Georgian street of inhabited basement flats with ground floors accommodating a series of antique shops, bars and offices. A small spur on its north side, St Stephen Place, leads to the old Stockbridge Market, of which the original entrance archway still stands. Parallel to St Stephen Street, to the south, lies Circus Lane, a mews lane, integrating both old and new buildings. Stockbridge Market The main road through Stockbridge is Raeburn Place, a street of mixed character, with numerous small shops at ground-floor level. The link from this street to the New Town is via Deanhaugh Street and North West Circus Place. Saunders Street, south of the bridge, was built in 1974 as part of a slum clearance programme. The medical centre to its east is part of the same scheme. Gloucester Lane marks the line of the medieval road from the village to St Cuthbert's Church at the west end of Princes Street. One building close to the Stockbridge end, predates the New Town. It is a merchant's house built about 1790 from the stones of demolished buildings in the Old Town and was the birthplace of the painter David Roberts, who worked as a scene painter at Edinburgh's Theatre Royal and later London's Covent Garden. Leslie Place, dating from the late Victorian period, joins the village to the western sections of the New Town: St Bernards Crescent; Carlton Street; Danube Street, Ann Street and Dean Terrace. To the north of this is a less formal area of narrower streets: Dean Street; Cheyne Street; Raeburn Street and Dean Park Street. The north-eastern route out of the area, towards Leith, runs along Hamilton Place. Dean Bank spurs off this road, running alongside the Water of Leith. Hamilton Place holds both the local library (1898) and primary school (1874). Saxe Coburg Street, a small Georgian cul-de-sac just to the north, leads to the small and bow-ended square of Saxe Coburg Place. This formal space was never completed due to ground level problems and Glenogle Baths (1897) were instead built on the corner of the square. To the north, St Bernard's Row leads out past another little Georgian cul-de-sac, Malta Terrace, to Inverleith and the Botanic Gardens. One of the Colonies The Colonies Between Glenogle Road and the Water of Leith are eleven parallel streets, collectively known as the \\"Stockbridge Colonies\\", built between 1861 and 1911 by the Edinburgh Co-operative Building Company to provide low-cost housing for the artisan class. The streets are named after the Company's founders, including geologist and writer Hugh Miller (1802‚Äì56). The colony houses are now coveted properties, due partly to their location near the Royal Botanic Gardens and Inverleith Park, and ease of access to the city centre. St Bernard's Well Saint Bernard's well in 1800.Stoddart, John (1800), Remarks on local Scenery and Manners in Scotland. Pub. William Miller, London. Vol.1. Facing P. 1 St Bernard's Well in 2010 Statue of Hygieia This mineral water well is on the south bank of the Water of Leith, on an estate once known as St Bernard's. Just below a footpath is St Bernard's Well (); a small well- house was originally built in 1760. The waters of the well were held in high repute for their medicinal qualities, and the nobility and gentry took summer quarters in the valley to drink deep draughts of the water and take the country air. In 1788 Lord Gardenstone, a wealthy Court of Session law lord, who thought he had benefited from the mineral spring, commissioned Alexander Nasmyth to design a new pump room and ornate structure over. The builder John Wilson began work in 1789. It is in the shape of a circular Greek temple supported by ten tall Doric order columns, based on Sibyl's Temple at Tivoli. The original statue (made of Coade Stone) was all but unrecognisable by 1820 and the temple stood for 50 years with no statue.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol V In 1884 the lands (including the well) were purchased by the Edinburgh publisher William Nelson, who commissioned the current statue of Hygieia from David Watson Stevenson and presented the improved well to the city as a landmark.Edinburgh and District: Ward Lock Travel Guide 1939 St Bernard's F.C., a once successful Scottish team but now defunct were named after the famous well and played in Stockbridge. The mosaic interior is by Thomas Bonnar. The superiority of much of the St Bernard's estate was purchased in the 1790s by Sir Henry Raeburn, who almost immediately began selling it off by feu charters, although he continued to live in St. Bernard's House until his death in 1823. (The house was demolished in 1826 to make way for the east side of Carlton Street). St. Bernard's Bridge and the Water of Leith In the opening years of the 19th century George Lauder of Inverleith Mains also acquired parts of these lands as evidenced by a charter whereby \\"Henry Raeburn, as retoured heir to Sir Henry Raeburn, Knight, Portrait Painter, Edinburgh, his father, was seised on the 19 March 1824 in a piece of ground for the purpose of making a communication by a stone bridge across the Water of Leith from the New Street called Atholl Street, now India Place, to the grounds of St Bernards, parish of St Cuthberts, which piece of ground had previously been sold by George Lauder residing at Inverleith Mains, to the said (deceased) Sir Henry Raeburn on 28 June 1823\\". Doubtless it was thought that this new bridge (built the following year by James Milne, and today known as St. Bernard's Bridge) would assist in making those so far undeveloped parts of Stockbridge, and the Raeburn lands, attractive to developers. George Lauder, the great- grandfather of Sir Harry Lauder, had also purchased St. Bernard's Well and surrounding land in April 1812 from Francis Garden Campbell of Troup & Glenlyon. His eldest surviving son is described in the Edinburgh Annual Post Office Directories as \\"William Lauder of St.Bernards Well, farmer\\" until his death in nearby Saunders Street in 1858.\\"The Ancestry of Sir Harry Lauder\\" in The Scottish Genealogist, vol.liii, no.2, Edinburgh, June 2006, pp.74‚Äì87. He was buried in Dean Cemetery. In 1884 St. Bernard's Well was purchased and presented to his fellow Edinburgh townsmen by the publisher William Nelson, after it had been restored and redecorated by Thomas Bonnar, with a new statue of Hygieia, carved by David Watson Stevenson. Dean Terrace and Ann Street today overlook the valley and Well. The well closed to the public in the 1940s, but was restored in 2013 and is now maintained by the City of Edinburgh Council and open to the public for three hours on occasional Sundays during April to September. Culture and sport The first ever rugby international (Calcutta Cup match), Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, 1890 Raeburn Place is the main retail thoroughfare, and the playing fields there were the location of the first international rugby match when the Edinburgh Academy sports ground hosted the game between Scotland and England on 27 March 1871. Note ‚Äì This was a rugby football game; the split into rugby union and rugby league did not occur until 1895. Stockbridge contains speciality shops including a cheese shop as well as many charity shops (some of which are among the highest grossing in the UK). The Bailie Bar pub is mentioned in various pub and tourist guides. There is a popular farmers' market each Sunday at Jubilee Gardens, close to the Water of Leith. The Edinburgh Academy's sports grounds are adjacent to The Grange Club, which is home turf of the Scottish cricket team. The venue hosted two fixtures of the 1999 Cricket World Cup. St Bernard's F.C. were a successful side but suffered declining support in the face of Hearts and Hibs. The neighbourhood is also home to the Stockbridge Pipe Band, founded in 1994. The Band are current British, European, World and Cowal Champions in G4b of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association. Each year Stockbridge hosts a community festival, normally lasting 9 days at the end of June. Since 1988, the festival has held the Stockbridge Duck Race to raise money for local charities. 1000 rubber ducks are released into the Water of Leith. Each has a number written on its head and the first ducks past the winning line win prizes for their sponsors. \\"Duck Wardens\\" follow the ducks to keep them out of the reeds and to stop children spectating from falling into the river. Hundreds of people turn out every year to cheer for their duck. The community council which covers Stockbridge is Stockbridge and Inverleith Community Council (also covering Comely Bank).

For example: ‚Äì Mary Reilly; North & South; Women Talking Dirty (directed by David Furnish); Rebus; Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Notable buildings Madame Doubtfire lived and ran a shop in Stockbridge. It was a run-down second-hand clothes shop which occupied for many years a basement area in South East Circus Place, now Frame Creative, a design agency, and the Doubtfire Gallery. The name \\"Madame Doubtfire\\" remained in large, bold, faded-gold letters on the ageing shop fascia for many years after the lady's death\\"History\\", Edinburgh Stocksbridge.com (in 1979 aged 92Esther Oxford \\"The original Mrs Doubtfire\\", The Independent, 23 January 1994). The novelist Anne Fine lived in the area at the time and was, apparently, fascinated by the name. She used it for her novel Madame Doubtfire which was turned into the film, though the Robin Williams character Mrs. Doubtfire bears no resemblance to the Stockbridge original. Madame Doubtfire's favourite saying was \\"walls have ears\\". One of Scotland's best known brothels was located in Danube Street, Stockbridge. Dora Noyce (1900‚Äì77), the proprietor for about thirty years after the second world war, was fined 47 times for living off immoral earnings.Katie Emslie \\"Nights at city's blue Danube St\\", Edinburgh Evening News, 14 December 2005 She is remembered as a local legend, and was also a good friend of Madame Doubtfire. Academy of Urbanism awards The success of Stockbridge as an urban environment led to the area being shortlisted by The Academy of Urbanism for the award 'Great Neighbourhood of the Year: 2009'. On 15 May 2008, Stockbridge was chosen from a selection of 10 neighbourhoods to proceed as one of the three 'finalists', with the winners to be announced on 26 November 2008.

Under Arizona law at the time, a jury decided the question of guilt but a judge sitting without a jury decided the question of penalty after receiving evidence regarding aggravating and mitigating factors. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence. While the appeal in his habeas corpus case was pending in the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court decided Ring v. Arizona,. which held that such aggravating factors had to be proved to a jury rather than a judge. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Ring decision applied to Summerlin's case even though Ring was decided after Summerlin's conviction had become final on direct review. The state appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. Result The Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and stated that \\"we give retroactive effect to only a small set of 'watershed rules of criminal procedure implementing the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.' That a new procedural rule is 'fundamental' in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one 'without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 542 *List of United States Supreme Court cases References Further reading External links * United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and death penalty case law Capital punishment in Arizona 2004 in United States case law United States Sixth Amendment sentencing case law ","title":"Schriro v.

At the age of 16, he began working as an unpaid apprentice at the comics studios of Ricardo and Enrique Villagran in Buenos Aires, where his father had requested that they take him on. Zaffino made himself a recognised name in his country, working many years in important argentine comics, like Nippur de Lagash.Rebrote.com: Jorge Zaffino and Nippur (Archived copy from the original) 2009-08-05, at Wayback Machine In the mid-1980s, Zaffino made a trip to the U.S. with Ricardo Villagran, who was working for Comico at the time. On that trip, Zaffino met comics writer Chuck Dixon, and together they produced Winter World, a three part series for Eclipse. They continued to collaborate on comics, producing the seminal Punisher graphic novels Kingdom Gone and Assassin's Guild, and a Savage Sword of Conan story titled The Horned God. During this time, Zaffino worked regularly with comics writer Dan Chichester on various comics, including Critical Mass, and Terror Inc.. He did relatively little work in the U.S. comics industry, where he is mostly known for his art in Punisher, Clive Barker's Hellraiser and The 'Nam for Marvel Comics. Zaffino‚Äôs last work in the US was a story written by Dixon for the 1996 Batman Black and White mini series. He continued working for the Argentine comic market, but focused on his work as a painter. A follow up to Winter World called Winter Sea was entirely written and drawn for Marvel Comics, but was never published due to changes of Marvel's policy on creator- owned books at the time.Zaffino Official Website A third chapter of the Winter World saga was also planned, titled Winter War.Winterworld, ibid. In January 2010, a hardcover edition containing Winter World and Winter Sea was published through IDW Publishing. Zaffino died on July 12, 2002 at the age of 43 of a heart attack in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Unlike pure public goods, common pool resources face problems of congestion or overuse, because they are subtractable. A common-pool resource typically consists of a core resource (e.g. water or fish), which defines the stock variable, while providing a limited quantity of extractable fringe units, which defines the flow variable. While the core resource is to be protected or nurtured in order to allow for its continuous exploitation, the fringe units can be harvested or consumed. Common property systems A common property rights regime system (not to be confused with a common-pool resource) is a particular social arrangement regulating the preservation, maintenance, and consumption of a common-pool resource. The use of the term \\"common property resource\\" to designate a type of good has been criticized, because common-pool resources are not necessarily governed by common property protocols. Examples of common-pool resources include irrigation systems, fishing grounds, pastures, forests, water or the atmosphere. A pasture, for instance, allows for a certain amount of grazing to occur each year without the core resource being harmed. In the case of excessive grazing, however, the pasture may become more prone to erosion and eventually yield less benefit to its users. Because the core resources are vulnerable, common-pool resources are generally subject to problems of congestion, overuse, pollution, and potential destruction unless harvesting or use limits are devised and enforced. Management The use of many common-pool resources, if managed carefully, can be extended because the resource system forms a negative feedback loop, where the stock variable continually regenerates the fringe variable as long as the stock variable is not compromised, providing an optimum amount of consumption. However, consumption exceeding the fringe value reduces the stock variable, which in turn decreases the flow variable. If the stock variable is allowed to regenerate then the fringe and flow variables may also recover to initial levels, but in many cases the loss is irreparable. Ownership Common-pool resources may be owned by national, regional or local governments as public goods, by communal groups as common property resources, or by private individuals or corporations as private goods. When they are owned by no one, they are used as open access resources. Having observed a number of common pool resources throughout the world, Elinor Ostrom noticed that a number of them are governed by common property protocols ‚Äî arrangements different from private property or state administration ‚Äî based on self- management by a local community. Her observations contradict claims that common-pool resources must be privatized or else face destruction in the long run due to collective action problems leading to the overuse of the core resource (see also Tragedy of the commons). Definition matrix Common property protocols Common property systems of management arise when users acting independently threaten the total net benefit from common-pool resource. In order to maintain the resources, protocols coordinate strategies to maintain the resource as a common property instead of dividing it up into parcels of private property. Common property systems typically protect the core resource and allocate the fringe resources through complex community norms of consensus decision-making. Common resource management has to face the difficult task of devising rules that limit the amount, timing, and technology used to withdraw various resource units from the resource system. Setting the limits too high would lead to overuse and eventually to the destruction of the core resource while setting the limits too low would unnecessarily reduce the benefits obtained by the users. In common property systems, access to the resource is not free and common-pool resources are not public goods. While there is relatively free but monitored access to the resource system for community members, there are mechanisms in place which allow the community to exclude outsiders from using its resource. Thus, in a common property state, a common-pool resource appears as a private good to an outsider and as a common good to an insider of the community. The resource units withdrawn from the system are typically owned individually by the appropriators. A common property good is rivaled in consumption. Analysing the design of long-enduring CPR institutions, Elinor Ostrom identified eight design principles which are prerequisites for a stable CPR arrangement: # Clearly defined boundaries # Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions # Collective-choice arrangements allowing for the participation of most of the appropriators in the decision making process # Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators # Graduated sanctions for appropriators who do not respect community rules # Conflict- resolution mechanisms which are cheap and easy to access # Minimal recognition of rights to organize (e.g., by the government) # In case of larger CPRs: Organisation in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small, local CPRs at their bases. Common property systems typically function at a local level to prevent the overexploitation of a resource system from which fringe units can be extracted. In some cases, government regulations combined with tradable environmental allowances (TEAs) are used successfully to prevent excessive pollution, whereas in other cases ‚Äî especially in the absence of a unique government being able to set limits and monitor economic activities ‚Äî excessive use or pollution continue. =Adaptive governance= The management of common-pool resources is highly dependent upon the type of resource involved. An effective strategy at one location, or of one particular resource, may not be necessarily appropriate for another. In The Challenge of Common-Pool Resources, Ostrom makes the case for adaptive governance as a method for the management of common-pool resources. Adaptive governance is suited to dealing with problems that are complex, uncertain and fragmented, as is the management of common-pool resources. Ostrom outlines five basic protocol requirements for achieving adaptive governance.Ostrom, Elinor. (2010). \\"The Challenge of common-pool resources\\". In: Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 50:4, 8-21. These include: * Achieving accurate and relevant information, by focusing on the creation and use of timely scientific knowledge on the part of both the managers and the users of the resource * Dealing with conflict, acknowledging the fact that conflicts will occur, and having systems in place to discover and resolve them as quickly as possible * Enhancing rule compliance, through creating responsibility for the users of a resource to monitor usage * Providing infrastructure, that is flexible over time, both to aid internal operations and create links to other resources * Encouraging adaption and change to address errors and cope with new developments Open access resources In economics, open access resources are, for the most part, rivalrous, non- excludable goods. This makes them similar to common goods during times of prosperity. Unlike many common goods, open access goods require little oversight or may be difficult to restrict access. However, as these resources are first come, first served, they may be affected by the phenomenon of the tragedy of the commons. Two possibilities may follow: a common property or an open access system. An open access system is set up to continue the ideals of an open access resource in which everything is up for grabs, e.g., land. This occurred during the expansion of the U.S. west where thousands of acres were given away to the first one to claim and work the land. However, in a different setting, such as fishing, there will be drastically different consequences. Since fish are an open access resource, it is relatively simple to fish and profit. If fishing becomes profitable, there will be more fishers and fewer fish. Fewer fish lead to higher prices which will lead again to more fishers, as well as lower reproduction of fish. This is a negative externality and an example of problems that arise with open access goods.

The mansion and outbuildings incorporate remains of a former monastery, the Abbey of St Mary de la Pr√© (the suffix meaning \\"in or of the Meadow\\"), near the River Nene south south-east of Northampton. It was founded as a nunnery about the year 1145 devoted to the congregation of the major Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy, France. The Abbey's expansive sloping grounds are a nationally protected Wars of the Roses battlefield, as a one-time site of the advance of the Yorkists during the Battle of Northampton (1460).

He is recorded as giving ten beams towards the repair of the church in 1232, and another five oaks for work on the Refectory in 1258. Work and customs of the town and Abbey Delapr√© was one of two Cluniac nunneries in England (the other being Arthington Priory in Yorkshire). The Cluniac congregation was initially a reform movement of Benedictine life. Monasteries in the congregation were supervised directly by the great abbey at Cluny. Typically a dozen to twenty nuns resided at any one time. The Guild of Weavers at Northampton made an annual procession to the Abbey church each Easter Monday where, according to the ordinances of the Guild in 1431, they would offer up: From its first foundation, the abbey gave 21s. 8d. yearly to the poor distributed by the parish church in money, bread, and fish, and a further 5s. yearly from later benefactions. As with others, the abbey was surrendered to the crown as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, closing in 1538. After much later use and alteration as a private residence and in World War II service, the house and its cluster of outbuildings which replaced the abbey in phased building works spanning the 16th to 18th centuries served as the Northamptonshire Record Office and the library of the related records society. The building is Grade II* listed for heritage. A heritage shop and caf√© overlooking its grand courtyard opened in 2017. The main building opens for educational visits, tours and weddings at the end of 2017. The Delapr√© Abbey Preservation Trust manages the buildings.

The cross was begun in 1291 by John of Battle; he worked with William of Ireland to carve the statues. Its lower tier of stone books may have featured prayers for the Queen's soul and her biography. The grounds of Delapr√© are a Scheduled Ancient Monument due to their partial battlefield status. =St Andrew's Priory built by a relative of founder= In the north-west corner of the walled town depicted in John Speed's map of 1610 was the Cluniac priory of St Andrew founded by Simon de Senlis, Earl of Northampton the father of the founder of Delapr√©. =Timeline= The west front *1145 - Delapr√© Abbey was built by Simon, the son of Simon de Senlis, the 2nd Earl of Northampton. *1290 - The death of Eleanor of Castile, the wife of Edward I and Queen of England.

The cort√®ge travelled through Northampton and stopped at Delapr√© Abbey for the night. The King stayed at Northampton Castle. The cort√®ge left the following day and, at the top of the hill, the ground was consecrated.

The nuns tended the wounds of those injured at the battle. Many of the battle-dead were buried in the nuns' graveyard (now the walled garden). =After the dissolution= J. P. Neale In 1542 the Tate family purchased the Abbey grounds from the Crown; they started work on the gardens. Zouch Tate is recorded as having laid out a typical Elizabethan-style garden. This is thought to have been where the enclosed formal garden can now be found. The Tates lived at Delapr√© until 1764, when they sold the estate to the Bouverie family. The majority of the present buildings date from this time. The design of the grounds became influenced by the style of Capability Brown. The Bouverie family changed the garden to one featuring fruit and vegetables, with orchards planted elsewhere. This was similar to the earlier fruit garden of the original abbey. Researchers believe the present walled garden is on the site of the nuns' burial ground, as evidence of graves was discovered during the garden's construction. During the 19th century, other typical Victorian features were added, such as the rock and water gardens, and garden conservatories for peaches and grapes; a ha-ha was also constructed. The buildings for growing fruit remain. Current state =Buildings= Stable Block of Delapr√© Abbey *What remains today consists of four ranges based around an almost square courtyard; probably remains of the earlier cloisters, with the passage around the north, west and east sides being the former cloister walks. in turn citing Gotch, J A, The Old Halls and Manor Houses of Northamptonshire, (1936) *The thicker walls found in the northern part of the main building are probably part of the walls of the church of the abbey. Almost nothing of the medieval buildings remain; two small recesses found in the cloister walk may have been used for keeping candles at night. *What is seen today is the result of work that started with the passing of the house in three phases, spanning the 16th to 18th centuries and much 19th-century redecoration. *The stables at the northern end of the property date from around 1750‚Äì1765. They were renovated in 1971 by John Goff, then County Architect. =Restoration= Following the success of a Heritage Lottery Fund application in 2013, a ¬£6.3 million restoration project began in 2016. The Delapre Abbey Preservation Trust will manage the Abbey, which opened to the public for the first time in 900 years on the 17 March 2018. =Grounds= Ornamental Rock & Water Gardens in Delapre Park A flood lake caused by bunding Delapre Golf Centre ClubhouseThere are about of parkland and of more formal gardens. Ornamental features include: * A ha-ha * A lake Delapr√© Abbey * Delapr√© Woods * Rock and water gardens * Tree sculptures Part of the estate has been developed as the public Delapr√© Golf Course. Northampton Borough Council (NBC) added bunding to the London Road side of the grounds to prevent unauthorised vehicular access to the grounds. In the wet spring of 2007, this caused a flood lake to appear, which was condemned as dangerous to the public. In November 2006, NBC's planning committee approved an application to remove the bunding but successive administrations have to date not provided funds to perform the work - despite public concerns over the flooding. The Homes & Communities Agency has since indicated an interest in using the bund material on a nearby housing development. =Formal garden= In 1977 and 1978 three sculptures were installed in the walled garden: *\\"The Lady with Kittens\\" and \\"The Lovers\\", the work of Walter Ritchie, were donated to Northampton after being displayed at an exhibition of brickwork sculptures at The Building Centre, London. The large brick panels depict episodes in the life of the mythical Sarah Wellington-Gore. *\\"Woman and the Fish\\" is a listed sculpture by Frank Dobson, one of UK's most respected sculptors. This was given to Northampton after the Festival of Britain in 1951. It previously stood in the Memorial Gardens in the town centre, where it had been vandalised. It was repaired and transferred to its current location after an appeal for funds to meet the high costs of restoration.

It was directed by Raymond Martino and written by William Applegate Jr. and John Larrabee. Its plot borrows heavily from the film Die Hard, with Smith taking the lead role. Plot Carrie Wink (Anna Nicole Smith) is a beautiful and voluptuous helicopter pilot employed by Heliscort, a company that offers heli-taxi transport to high level clients. She is married to Gordon Wink (Richard Steinmetz), a detective with the LAPD, with whom we see some flashbacks of their relationship. Fairfax (Charles M. Huber), a ruthless South African criminal mastermind prone to quoting Shakespeare, is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices or circuits that can somehow \\"shift the balance of power in the world.\\" Through deception and violence he has managed to acquire three of the devices. Carrie, unbeknownst to her, has shuttled two of Fairfax‚Äôs goons to the site of one of their exchanges. The location of the fourth device, tucked away in the Zitex building, an 86-floor skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, is the scene where most of the drama unfolds as Fairfax sets his sights on securing the last device. Carrie is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his French assistant Jacques (Jonathan Fuller). She takes them to the Zitex building, where Fairfax has his band of terrorists take over the entire security system and liquidate the security guards as well appropriate an entire floor. Somehow there seems to be very few people in the 86-floor building. He meets up with Cranston (Eugene Robert Glazer), the possessor of the fourth device. As with the previous three deliverers of the devices, Fairfax plans on killing him. Cranston is mortally wounded in a shootout. Before entering the building, Cranston had suspected trouble, so his companion went in unseen. Before he dies, Cranston escapes with the suitcase holding the device and meets up with Carrie, who helps him up to the roof. He gives her the suitcase and admonishes her to keep it away from Fairfax at all costs. Carrie is hotly pursued over the roof by a muscular goon. With no way out but over the top, she jumps into a window washer's rig. She attaches herself to a steel winch cable and drops many floors down the side of the building at the speed of gravity until she is brought to a halt by the end of the cable. Now, suspended and dangerously vulnerable to the gunman on the roof, who is shooting repetitively at her, she avoids being shot by constantly swinging around. Carrie finally crashes through a window just as the gunman destroys the winch with machine-gun fire, causing the cable to break free. Carrie hides the suitcase in a trash trolley. She finds a young boy playing on his toy bike and protects him (the boy's mother has been shot previously; she was blonde and was mistaken for Carrie earlier). Carrie meets up with a small but comically gung-ho security guard and asks for his gun. Now armed, she proceeds back to the floor where she knows that hostages have been taken. Carrie helps confuse the terrorist operating the surveillance cameras by lighting fires in the waste paper bins, causing the fire system to alert the LA fire brigade as well as disabling some monitors. Fairfax and his gunmen capture her and offer the freedom of the hostages for the location of the suitcase. Carrie witnesses a male hostage killed in cold blood by the female terrorist, after he attempts to exchange his own freedom for the $100,000 he has stolen from the building's computer accounts. Carrie reveals the location of the suitcase and is taken into a room by a guard with an obvious sexual intent. Carrie's LAPD officer husband, Gordon (Richard Steinmetz), has been investigating the strange goings-on around town. He heads for Zitex (not knowing his wife is also there) and coincidentally stumbles upon his wife's mobile phone. Fearing for his wife‚Äôs safety, Gordon leads Fairfax‚Äôs men on a chase around the building. The Guard strips Carrie and tilts her on the table and almost raped her, before stabbing him in the leg with a letter opener and shooting him dead. Now she comes up behind Natasha the terrorist (Deirdre Imershein) and ruthlessly shoots her in the back, freeing the hostages. A previous flashback of Carrie shooting a handgun with her husband shows her to be an expert shot. This flashback also takes the liberty of showing her second sex scene; the first shows her naked in the shower and then in bed with her husband. Her other physical skills‚Äîin combat‚Äîare still to be revealed. Gordon is being physically beaten up by a terrorist who is expert in hand-to-hand combat but is rescued by his wife. Fairfax finally finds the device, kills his right-hand man Jacques and heads for the roof, hoping to coerce Carrie at gunpoint into flying him out. He has not bargained on Gordon also being there (Gordon also has the young boy in tow). Gordon is shot in the shoulder. Carrie knocks the gun from his hand and engages Fairfax with swift kicks and punches which sends Fairfax falling to his death from the 86-story skyscraper to the street down below. The young boy is reunited with his blonde mother, who has not been killed after all, as an injured Carrie and her husband enter an ambulance.

The current version is developed by Fria Ligan under license by Cabinet Entertainment and published in Swedish and English by Fria Ligan and Modiphius respectively. A video game adaptation named Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden was released December 2018. Publication history Mutant (1984) was the second role-playing game published by √Ñventyrsspel, and was based on the Basic Role-Playing system, but adopted a setting full of mutants and mutated animals in a post-apocalyptic Scandinavia. It was written by Gunilla Jonsson & Michael Peters√©n with illustrations by Nils Gulliksson. The game was expanded by Mutant 2 (1986) and published throughout the 1980s. Then Target published a cyberpunk Mutant, with a completely different setting and new character options called \\"nya\\" (or \\"new\\") Mutant (1989). Mutant RYMD (1992) or ‚ÄúMutant SPACE‚Äù changed the setting once again, by taking it out into the solar system. This iteration, however, was short-lived: after the English release of Kult came Mutant Chronicles (1993), this new edition was actually a synthesis, combining elements of Mutant RYMD and Kult ‚Äî but removing all the religious elements from the latter, and, as a first for Target Games was released almost simultaneously in Sweden and in the US, as both a pen and paper role-playing game, collectible miniatures game (Warzone) and board game (Siege of the Citadel). The English translation of Mutant Chronicles was provided by Heartbreaker Hobbies and Games. After publication ceased the original (post-apocalyptic) Mutant game was picked up by J√§rnringen (The Iron Ring), who published their version Mutant: Underg√•ngens arvtagare (2002). Where the original game, like many games published in the 80s, did not offer much world building; Underg√•ngens Arvtagare considerably expanded on the premise of a fledgling Scandinavian civilization rising from the ruins. J√§rnringen supported this line through 2008. In 2014 a new game in the franchise was released by Fria Ligan (Free League), under license from Paradox Entertainment (the successor company of Target Games, now Cabinet Entertainment). Dubbed \\"Mutant - √Ör Noll\\" the game uses the same premise as the original 1984 version and \\"Underg√•ngens Arvtagare\\", but once more offers a brand-new setting: the game world is set several hundred years earlier, when the apocalypse is still fresh and mutations are new and unstable. 1984 version The campaign setting of the 1984 release was very similar to Gamma World, a mostly undefined world taking place hundreds of years after a big catastrophe. The world is populated by humans, robots, and mutants (including anthropomorphic animals). The rule system was similar to the modified Basic Role-Playing rules used in Target Games' earlier Drakar och Demoner game, utilizing a percentile die. In 1986 a rules expansion called Mutant 2 was published that among other things introduced a more advanced skill system, advanced rules for combat, hit locations and a more developed campaign setting. 1989 version In 1989 Target Games introduced a new version of Mutant (unofficially branded \\"New Mutant\\" to distinguish it from the older version). In this version, it was the year 2089 and the world was ruled by large corporations in gigantic cities, like in Judge Dredd. This was the first cyberpunk role-playing game in Swedish. The rules were roughly compatible with the old ruleset, but with more support for various firearms. Also a new character \\"class\\": androids to supplement robots and mutants. Mutant RYMD and Mutant Chronicles Mutant RYMD (\\"Mutant SPACE\\") was the next, short-lived, version of Mutant published in 1992. The campaign setting was similar to the 1989 version but in Mutant RYMD the corporations put much effort into space exploration and colonization, eventually reaching a fictional tenth planet named Nero and awakening an evil, supernatural force that attacks the solar system. Some of the monsters and symbols were taken from another of Target Games' role-playing games, Kult. The rules were more or less identical to that of the 1989 version of Mutant. In 1993 Mutant RYMD was discontinued in favor of Mutant Chronicles, a game which inherited many aspects of RYMD's campaign setting. Mutant - Underg√•ngens arvtagare After the reconstruction of Target Games and the transfer of its intellectual property to Paradox Entertainment, a new version of Mutant was published under license to a company called J√§rnringen in 2002. This version, Mutant - Underg√•ngens arvtagare (\\"Mutant - Heirs of the Apocalypse\\"), returned to the original post-apocalyptic campaign setting but with a new set of rules. Mutant - √Ör Noll and Year Zero In 2014 a new game in the franchise was released by Fria Ligan. In \\"√Ör Noll\\", and in future expansions, players can play through the emergence of the mutants, the mutated animals, the robots and finally the non-mutated humans into the ravaged world. \\"√Ör Noll\\" uses a custom set of rules based on the physical and psychological hardships of surviving in a post-apocalyptic world. \\"√Ör Noll\\" was translated into English and released as \\"Mutant - Year Zero\\" in December 2014. The first expansion to the Swedish version, \\"Genlab Alfa\\" was released in the spring of 2015. A German version of \\"√Ör Noll\\" was released as \\"Mutant - Jahr Null\\" in 2018.

It has been argued that the tavern sign, which reads (clockwise from top) Poets impalled wt Lawrell coranets (Poets impaled with laurel coronets), is that of the Mermaid Tavern.O'Callaghan, Michelle. (2006) The English Wits: Literature and Sociability in Early Modern England. Cambridge University Press. . p. 195. The Mermaid Tavern was a tavern on Cheapside in London during the Elizabethan era, located east of St. Paul's Cathedral on the corner of Friday Street and Bread Street. It was the site of the so-called \\"Fraternity of Sireniacal Gentlemen\\", a drinking club that met on the first Friday of every month that included some of the Elizabethan era's leading literary figures, among them Ben Jonson, John Donne, John Fletcher and Francis Beaumont, Thomas Coryat, John Selden, Robert Bruce Cotton, Richard Carew, Richard Martin, and William Strachey. A popular tradition has grown up that the group included William Shakespeare, although most scholars think that was improbable. The building According to Jonson, the Tavern was situated on Bread Street (\\"At Bread Street's Mermaid, having dined and merry...\\"). It probably had entrances on both Bread Street and Friday Street. The location corresponds to the modern junction between Bread Street and Cannon Street.Ed Glinert, Literary London: A Street by Street Exploration of the Capital's Literary ...Penguin UK, 2007. The tavern's landlord is named as William Johnson in a will dated, 1603.Hotson, Leslie. \\"Shakespeare and Mine Host of the Mermaid\\" in Atlantic Monthly 151: 6 (June 1933), pp. 708‚Äì14. In 1600 a notable disorder, caused by some drunken members of a group known as the Damned Crew attacking the watch after they were challenged, began after they were ejected from the Mermaid Tavern.

Shakespeare and the Sireniacal gentlemen A fanciful 19th-century depiction of Shakespeare and his contemporaries at the Mermaid Tavern. Painting by John Faed, 1851. William Gifford, Jonson's 19th-century editor, wrote that the society was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603,Gifford, William. The Works of Ben Jonson. 9 vols. (1816) London: G. and W. Nichol, et al. I:lxv-lxvi. based on a note by John Aubrey, but Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower of London from 19 July of that year until 1616, and it is hardly likely that someone of Raleigh's status and temperament would preside over tavern meetings.Shapiro, I. A. \\"The Mermaid Club\\" in The Modern Language Review 45:1 (January 1950), pp. 6‚Äì17; pp. 17‚Äì8. Gifford also was the first to name the Mermaid as the site of Jonson and Shakespeare's battle-of-wits debates in which they discussed politics, religion, and literature. According to tradition, Shakespeare, though not as learned as Jonson, often won these debates because Jonson was more ponderous, going off on tangents that did not pertain to the topic at hand. How much of the legend is true is a matter of speculation. There is an extended reference to the Tavern and its witty conversation in Master Francis Beaumont's Letter to Ben Jonson. Coryat's letters also refer to the Tavern and mention Jonson, Donne, Cotton, Inigo Jones, and Hugh Holland ‚Äì though Coryat was intimate with this group apparently from 1611 on. Shakespeare certainly had connections with some of the tavern's literary clientele, as well as with the tavern's landlord, William Johnson. When Shakespeare bought the Blackfriars gatehouse on March 10, 1613, Johnson was listed as a trustee for the mortgage. And Hugh Holland, mentioned in Coryat's letters, composed one of the commendatory poems prefacing the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays (1623). \\"The Sireniacal gentlemen\\" also met at the Mitre tavern in London, that seemed to be located nearby.O'Callaghan, Michelle, \\"Patrons of the Mermaid tavern (act. 1611)\\".

The opening scene of Bartholomew Fair by Ben Jonson (1614) has one of the characters, John Littlewit, refer negatively to those \\"Canary-drinking\\" wits who keep company at the ‚ÄòThree Cranes, Mitre, and Mermaid‚Äô.

Mermaid Tavern in literature An illustration depicting Shakespeare and Jonson debating at the tavern Jonson and Beaumont both mentioned the tavern in their verse. Jonson's Inviting a Friend to Supper refers to \\"A pure cup of rich Canary wine, / Which is the Mermaid's now, but shall be mine\\". Beaumont, in his verse letter to Jonson, describes \\"things we have seen done / At the Mermaid\\", including, > ...words that have been > So nimble, and so full of subtle flame, > As if that every one from whence they came, > Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest. Two hundred years later, in early February 1819, John Keats composed a poem on the legend initiated by Beaumont, Lines on the Mermaid Tavern‚Äî26 lines of verse that open and close with the following couplets: > Souls of poets dead and gone, > What Elysium have ye known, > Happy field or mossy cavern, > Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern? Keats' precedent was followed by Theodore Watts-Dunton in his poem Wassail Chorus at the Mermaid Tavern, a Christmas drinking-song imagined having been sung in the tavern, in which each new verse is \\"composed\\" by one of the poet- guests, including Raleigh, Drayton, \\"Shakespeare's friend\\", Heywood and Jonson. In his 1908 Prophets, Priests and Kings (p. 323), A. G. Gardiner turned to these \\"intellectual revels\\" at the Mermaid Tavern to express the independent genius of his friend G. K. Chesterton: > Time and place are accidents: he is elemental and primitive. He is not of > our time, but of all times. One imagines him wrestling with the giant > Skrymir and drinking deep draughts from the horn of Thor, or exchanging > jests with Falstaff at the Boar's Head in Eastcheap, or joining in the > intellectual revels at the Mermaid Tavern, or meeting Johnson foot to foot > and dealing blow for a mighty blow. With Rabelais he rioted, and Don Quixote > and Sancho were his \\"vera brithers.\\" One seems to see him coming down from > the twilight of fable, through the centuries, calling wherever there is a > good company, and welcome wherever he calls, for he brings no cult of the > time or pedantry of the schools with him.

It was commissioned by the sultan Ahmad al-Mansur of the Saadian dynasty a few months after his accession in 1578, with construction and embellishment continuing throughout most of his reign. The palace, decorated with materials imported from numerous countries ranging from Italy to Mali, was used for receptions and designed to showcase the Sultan's wealth and power. The palace was neglected after al-Mansur's death in 1603 and eventually fell into ruin after the decline of the Saadian dynasty. Its valuable materials (especially marble) were stripped away and reused in other buildings across Morocco. Today it is a major tourist attraction in Marrakesh as well as an exhibition space; notably, the Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque is displayed here.  Name  The name el- Badi' (), typically translated as \\"the Incomparable\\", is one of the 99 Names of God in Islam. Ahmad al-Mansur may have chosen the name due to his own reputed piety, but also to reflect his intention to create a superlative palace to impress guests. The name also had historical precedents in Moorish palace architecture as it was used to designate one of the pavilions in the Caliph's palace in Cordoba, Spain (al-Andalus).  History  = Background = Prior to the reign of the Saadian sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib (ruled 1557-1574), the rulers of Marrakesh resided in the old Kasbah (citadel) built by the Almohad dynasty in the late 12th and early 13th century. According to the contemporary chronicler Marmol, Moulay Abdallah, a major builder in his time, was the first to build a new palace in the area where the El Badi Palace stands, along the northern edge of the Almohad kasbah near the Kasbah Mosque and the newly-begun Saadian Tombs. The El Badi Palace proper, however, was constructed by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur al-Dhahabi (ruled 1578-1603) at the height of the Saadian dynasty's power. The palace's construction, along with al-Mansur's other projects, was probably funded by the substantial ransom paid by the Portuguese after the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578. The wealth of al-Mansur's reign was also due to the Saadians' control of the sugar trade. Morocco was at that time a significant exporter of sugar towards Europe, along with other products such as silk, copper, and leather. In 1590 al-Mansur launched military expeditions to the south which resulted in the conquest of Timbuktu and Gao in Mali and the defeat of the Songhai Empire. This control of the trans-Saharan trade routes allowed al-Mansur to increase Morocco's access not only to gold but also to slaves ‚Äì on which the sugar processing industry relied and which were necessary to compete with the sugar trade coming from Brazil and the Caribbean (controlled by Europeans and also reliant on slaves). = Construction = According to al-Ifrani, construction of the palace began in December 1578 (Shawwal 986 AH), only a few months after the Saadian victory at the Battle of the Three Kings and Ahmad's accession to power, and took fifteen years, finishing in 1593 (1002 AH). French historian Gaston Deverdun, however, points out that the \\"Portuguese plan\\" of 1585 (an illustrated document providing important information on the layout of Marrakesh's kasbah at the time) shows us a fully-completed palace, while at the same time there also exist records of Ahmad al-Mansur purchasing marble for construction up until 1602, a year before his death. This suggests that the major constructions of the palace may have been completed by the early 1580s but that al-Mansur continued to embellish the palace up until his death. The construction of the palace was a major enterprise. The sultan had workers and artisans brought from many regions, including Europe, to aid in the construction; so much so that a flourishing market established itself near the construction site to cater to the workers. Al-Mansur was so involved in making sure that work continued efficiently that he even provided child care for his workers in order to ensure they were not distracted by other priorities. Materials were also imported from multiple regions and foreign countries, including marble columns fabricated in Italy and lime and plaster from Timbuktu. = Decline = After the fall of the Saadians and the rise of the Alaouite dynasty the palace entered a period of rapid decline. It does not appear to have been maintained after al-Mansur's death and its premises were even plagued by malaria at one point. While the first Alaouite sultan, Moulay Rashid, was able to live here briefly in 1668-1669, less than ten years later his successor Moulay Isma'il ibn Sharif was unwilling to let ambassadors visit it because of its bad state. According to al-Ifrani, in 1707-08 (1119 AH) Moulay Isma'il ordered that the palace be demolished and stripped of its contents, materials and decorations, which were then re-used in the construction of his new palace and capital in Meknes. In reality, the dismantlement of the palace likely occurred progressively over time, beginning well before 1707 and also continuing after Moulay Isma'il. Architectural elements of Saadian origin, most likely including elements from the Badi Palace, are found in a number of buildings across Morocco and even in Algiers; for example, the Mausoleum of Moulay Isma'il in Meknes and the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II in Fes. In the meantime, the ruins of the palace became a grazing site for animals and even an owl sanctuary. = Present day = The palace today is a well-known tourist attraction. The complex contains an exhibition space where the 12th-century Almoravid minbar that once stood in the Kutubiyya Mosque is on display, in addition to other exhibition spaces opened in 2018. For a number of years the Marrakesh Folklore Festival has taken place within the palace.  Architecture and layout  Overall view of the Badi Palace's main courtyard, featuring a central water basin and four large sunken gardens = The Saadian palace complex = The Saadian palaces formed a complex built inside the vast kasbah (citadel) on the south side of the city, originally laid out during the Almohad period under Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur. Some of the various elements of the Saadian palaces may have already been built under Abdallah al-Ghalib, while Ahmad al-Mansur added to them and embellished them. The complex was entered via a \\"Grand Mechouar\\", a vast ceremonial square or courtyard, to the south of the Almohad-era Kasbah Mosque. The main gate of the royal palace was situated here and led to a smaller mechouar from which a long passage ran east to give access to the palace's various components. On the south side of this passage were most of the functional annexes of the palace, including kitchens, warehouses, the treasury, and stables. On the north side of the passage was the vast reception palace, the El Badi proper, along with the private quarters of the sultan and his family, their bathhouses (hammams), a private mosque, and the mint. Finally, beyond these structures, occupying the whole eastern side of the kasbah, were a number of pleasure gardens. These included the Crystal Garden (az-zujaj), the royal garden known as al-Mustaha (\\"the Desired\\") with a grand water basin, and the Qasr Garden or inner garden for al-Mansur's private quarters. Ahmad al-Mansur also renovated the vast Agdal Gardens to the south of the kasbah, originally created by the Almohads. The entire palace and citadel complex was surrounded by fortified walls, as in Almohad times and as still seen today. One curious feature inside the palace complex was a tall tower which is prominently depicted in descriptions of Marrakesh during the Saadian period but which was missing in the later Alaouite era. Of uncertain origin, this structure may have been a private observation tower dating from either the Almohad or Saadian dynasty, used for the enjoyment of the sultan and similar to smaller elevated lookouts present in some aristocratic mansions in Marrakesh and Fes.

An annex on the northwest side of the palace which contained residential quarters, possibly for foreign ambassadors hammam) The eastern pavilion (the Qubbat al-Zujaj), no longer standing today but showing remains of the underground water infrastructure The El Badi Palace itself was a reception palace where Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur hosted and received guests. The palace was a lavish display of the best craftsmanship of the Saadian period, constructed using some of the most expensive materials of the time, including gold and onyx, with colonnades made of Italian marble exchanged with Italian merchants for their equivalent weight in sugar. Although the core structure of the palace's walls were made in rammed earth reinforced with a mixture of lime, the walls were covered with these expensive materials and elaborate decoration (though today they stand bare due to the palace's later ruin). The floors were paved with marble and zellij (mosaic tilework), the ceilings and capitals of the columns were gilded, and the walls were covered in intricately-carved stucco with calligraphic inscriptions. The fragments of zellij which have been uncovered in modern excavations in the palace show that the Saadian craftsmen had created geometric patterns of even greater complexity than those of previous periods, including examples of twenty-pointed stars. The various gardens and pools featured fountains with jets of water, reminiscent of the role of water in the Andalusian architecture of the Alhambra (which appears to have had a noted influence on Saadian architecture generally) and requiring an underground hydraulic infrastructure of vaults and channels. The floor plan of the palace is essentially rectangular, centered around a huge courtyard (measuring 135 by 110 metres) with a central pool (measuring 90.4 by 21.7 metres). The courtyard also had four enormous sunken gardens, excavated and rediscovered in modern times, which were arranged symmetrically around the central pool, as well as four other water basins (measuring roughly 30 by 20 metres) along the west and east sides of the courtyard. This arrangement was essentially that of a riad garden (a symmetrical interior garden in Moorish architecture) on a grand scale. Each side of this rectangular courtyard had a large pavilion with a grand and ornate cupola (qubba), around which were other cupolas and structures. The two largest pavilions faced each other at the eastern and western ends of the courtyard. The western one was known in Arabic as al-Qubbat al-Khamsiniya () named either after its surface area of some 50 cubits or the fact that it once featured 50 columns. \\"Al-Quba al-Khamsiniya\\" is also the title of a poem by Abd al-Aziz al-Fishtali, poet laureate of Sultan Ahmed al-Mansur's court. The pavilion served as a reception hall or throne hall for the sultan. An alcove in the back wall of the chamber marks the spot where the sultan used to sit in attendance. Above this alcove was an Arabic inscription carved in black marble amidst the white marble covering the rest of the walls. At the middle of the hall was a fountain flanked by two water basins covered in delicate zellij decoration and fed with water spurting from silver sculptures of animals such as leopards, lions and pythons. The pavilion on the eastern side of the courtyard (no longer standing today) was known as the Qubbat az-Zujaj () or Qubbat ad-Dahab (). It was reserved for the sultan's private use and gave access to the Crystal Garden to the east (mentioned above). The pavilion on the courtyard's north side was known as the Qubbat al-Khadra () and once had two stories with a number of rooms. An annex on the west side of this pavilion, paved with zellij and accessible to visitors today, contained three residential quarters which may have been used as guest quarters for foreign ambassadors. The southern pavilion was known as the Qubbat al-Khayzuran (; possibly also named after one of al-Mansur's favourite concubines) and may have led to the women's quarters. Behind this pavilion were bathhouses which have been partially excavated and whose remains can be visited today. Aside from the pavilions, the rest of the courtyard's perimeter was lined with a gallery featuring \\"lambrequin\\" or \\"muqarnas\\"-profiled arches similar to those seen in the Court of the Lions and in other Moroccan Architecture.

Next inning, Morris struck out the first two batters, then allowed a single to Lofton, who stole second and scored on Rich Aurilia's single. After Jeff Kent singled, Barry Bonds's triple scored two before Bonds scored on Santiago's single. The Cardinals got on the board in the bottom of the inning off of Kirk Rueter on Fernando Vi√±a's groundout with runners on second and third, but home runs by Lofton in the third and David Bell in the fifth off of Morris gave the Giants a 7‚àí1 lead. Albert Pujols hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth off of Rueter, but the Giants got those runs back in the sixth on Santiago's home run off of Mike Crudale. The Cardinals cut the lead to 9‚àí5 on Miguel Cairo's two-run home run in the bottom of the inning, then made it 9‚àí6 on J. D. Drew's home run in the eighth off of Tim Worrell, but Robb Nen pitched a scoreless ninth for the save as the Giants went up 1‚àí0 in the series. =Game 2= Thursday, October 10, 2002 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri In Game 2, the Giants went up 1‚àí0 on Rich Aurilia's home run in the first off of Woody Williams. His two-run home run in the fifth made it 3‚àí0. Jason Schmidt pitched shutout innings before allowing Eduardo P√©rez's home run in the eighth. The Giants added a run in the ninth on Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez's groundout off of Jason Isringhausen with runners on first and third while Robb Nen pitched a scoreless bottom of the inning for his second consecutive save. The Giants went up 2‚àí0 in the series heading to San Francisco. =Game 3= Saturday, October 12, 2002 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco In Game 3, the Giants loaded the bases in the second with no outs off of Chuck Finley, but only scored once on Rich Aurilia's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals responded in the third off of Russ Ortiz when with runners on second and third, √âdgar Renter√≠a's sacrifice fly and Jim Edmonds's groundout scored a run each. They added to their lead on home runs by Mike Matheny in the fourth and Edmonds in the fifth, but Barry Bonds's three-run home run in the fifth tied the game. In the sixth, Eli Marrero's leadoff home run off of Jay Witasick proved to be the game winner as the Cardinals' 5‚àí4 win cut the Giants' series lead to 2‚àí1. =Game 4= Sunday, October 13, 2002 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco The Cardinals took an early lead off Liv√°n Hern√°ndez, scoring two runs in the first inning on a Jim Edmonds groundout and a single by Tino Martinez. After being held scoreless for five innings the Giants' bats would answer in the sixth, when J. T. Snow hit a two-run double to score Jeff Kent and Barry Bonds. In the eighth, Benito Santiago would deliver the key blow for San Francisco with a two-run home run following an intentional walk to Bonds (with nobody on base). In the ninth, the Cardinals would threaten against Robb Nen, cutting the deficit to 4‚Äì3 with a Jim Edmonds single, which put runners at first and third base with one out for slugger Albert Pujols. However, Nen struck out Pujols and J. D. Drew to give the Giants a 3‚Äì1 series advantage. =Game 5= Monday, October 14, 2002 at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco Game 5 was a pitchers' duel between Matt Morris and Kirk Rueter as the Giants looked for their first pennant since 1989.

It is notable for its resident glow- worms, the bioluminescent larvae of Arachnocampa richardsae, a type of fungus gnat. Description and history The tunnel was bored through the sandstone in 1907 as part of the Newnes railway line that served the Newnes oil shale mines that operated during the early 20th century. The railway was closed in 1932 and the rails were pulled out of the tunnel. The tunnel is now contained within the Wollemi National Park and is a popular attraction for bushwalkers and tourists. Outside the tunnel, the area features spectacular gorges, caves and scenery. The site is maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. On the south side of the tunnel, a large gap in the road prevents vehicular access. According to some sources, this gap was created deliberately to keep cars out of the tunnel, because the exhaust fumes would have killed the glow-worms. On the north side of the tunnel, a track leads to Newnes.

In video technology, the magnification of digital material is known as upscaling or resolution enhancement. When scaling a vector graphic image, the graphic primitives that make up the image can be scaled using geometric transformations, with no loss of image quality. When scaling a raster graphics image, a new image with a higher or lower number of pixels must be generated. In the case of decreasing the pixel number (scaling down) this usually results in a visible quality loss. From the standpoint of digital signal processing, the scaling of raster graphics is a two-dimensional example of sample-rate conversion, the conversion of a discrete signal from a sampling rate (in this case the local sampling rate) to another.  Mathematical  Image scaling can be interpreted as a form of image resampling or image reconstruction from the view of the Nyquist sampling theorem. According to the theorem, downsampling to a smaller image from a higher-resolution original can only be carried out after applying a suitable 2D anti-aliasing filter to prevent aliasing artifacts. The image is reduced to the information that can be carried by the smaller image. In the case of up sampling, a reconstruction filter takes the place of the anti-aliasing filter.

A variety of techniques have been applied for this, including optimization techniques with regularization terms and the use of machine learning from examples.  Algorithms  An image size can be changed in several ways. = Nearest-neighbor interpolation = One of the simpler ways of increasing image size is nearest-neighbor interpolation, replacing every pixel with the nearest pixel in the output; for upscaling this means multiple pixels of the same color will be present. This can preserve sharp details in pixel art, but also introduce jaggedness in previously smooth images. 'Nearest' in nearest- neighbor doesn't have to be the mathematical nearest. One common implementation is to always round towards zero. Rounding this way produces fewer artifacts and is faster to calculate. = Bilinear and bicubic algorithms = Bilinear interpolation works by interpolating pixel color values, introducing a continuous transition into the output even where the original material has discrete transitions. Although this is desirable for continuous-tone images, this algorithm reduces contrast (sharp edges) in a way that may be undesirable for line art. Bicubic interpolation yields substantially better results, with an increase in computational cost. = Sinc and Lanczos resampling = Sinc resampling in theory provides the best possible reconstruction for a perfectly bandlimited signal. In practice, the assumptions behind sinc resampling are not completely met by real-world digital images. Lanczos resampling, an approximation to the sinc method, yields better results. Bicubic interpolation can be regarded as a computationally efficient approximation to Lanczos resampling. = Box sampling = One weakness of bilinear, bicubic and related algorithms is that they sample a specific number of pixels. When down scaling below a certain threshold, such as more than twice for all bi-sampling algorithms, the algorithms will sample non-adjacent pixels, which results in both losing data, and causes rough results. The trivial solution to this issue is box sampling, which is to consider the target pixel a box on the original image, and sample all pixels inside the box. This ensures that all input pixels contribute to the output. The major weakness of this algorithm is that it is hard to optimize. = Mipmap = Another solution to the downscale problem of bi- sampling scaling are mipmaps. A mipmap is a prescaled set of downscale copies. When downscaling the nearest larger mipmap is used as the origin, to ensure no scaling below the useful threshold of bilinear scaling is used. This algorithm is fast, and easy to optimize. It is standard in many frameworks such as OpenGL. The cost is using more image memory, exactly one third more in the standard implementation. = Fourier-transform methods = Simple interpolation based on Fourier transform pads the frequency domain with zero components (a smooth window-based approach would reduce the ringing). Besides the good conservation (or recovery) of details, notable is the ringing and the circular bleeding of content from the left border to right border (and the other way around). = Edge-directed interpolation = Edge-directed interpolation algorithms aim to preserve edges in the image after scaling, unlike other algorithms, which can introduce staircase artifacts. Examples of algorithms for this task include New Edge-Directed Interpolation (NEDI), Edge- Guided Image Interpolation (EGGI), Iterative Curvature-Based Interpolation (ICBI), and Directional Cubic Convolution Interpolation (DCCI). A 2013 analysis found that DCCI had the best scores in PSNR and SSIM on a series of test images. = hqx = For magnifying computer graphics with low resolution and/or few colors (usually from 2 to 256 colors), better results can be achieved by hqx or other pixel-art scaling algorithms. These produce sharp edges and maintain high level of detail. = Vectorization = Vector extraction, or vectorization, offer another approach. Vectorization first creates a resolution-independent vector representation of the graphic to be scaled. Then the resolution-independent version is rendered as a raster image at the desired resolution. This technique is used by Adobe Illustrator, Live Trace, and Inkscape. Scalable Vector Graphics are well suited to simple geometric images, while photographs do not fare well with vectorization due to their complexity. = Deep convolutional neural networks = This method uses machine learning for more detailed images such as photographs and complex artwork. Programs that use this method include waifu2x, Imglarger and Neural Enhance.  Applications  = General = Image scaling is used in, among other applications, web browsers,Analysis of image scaling algorithms used by popular web browsers image editors, image and file viewers, software magnifiers, digital zoom, the process of generating thumbnail images and when outputting images through screens or printers. = Video = This application is the magnification of images for home theaters for HDTV-ready output devices from PAL-Resolution content, for example from a DVD player. Upscaling is performed in real time, and the output signal is not saved. = Pixel-art scaling = As pixel-art graphics are usually low-resolution, they rely on careful placing of individual pixels, often with a limited palette of colors. This results in graphics that rely on stylized visual cues to define complex shapes with little resolution, down to individual pixels. This makes scaling of pixel art a particularly difficult problem. Specialized algorithms were developed to handle pixel-art graphics, as the traditional scaling algorithms do not take perceptual cues into account. Since a typical application is to improve the appearance of fourth-generation and earlier video games on arcade and console emulators, many are designed to run in real time for small input images at 60 frames per second. On fast hardware, these algorithms are suitable for gaming and other real-time image processing. These algorithms provide sharp, crisp graphics, while minimizing blur. Scaling art algorithms have been implemented in a wide range of emulators, 2D game engines and game engine recreations such as HqMAME, DOSBox and ScummVM. They gained recognition with gamers, for whom these technologies encouraged a revival of 1980s and 1990s gaming experiences. Such filters are currently used in commercial emulators on Xbox Live, Virtual Console, and PSN to allow classic low- resolution games to be more visually appealing on modern HD displays. Recently released games that incorporate these filters include Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection, Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and Akumaj≈ç Dracula X Chi no Rondo.

Named for the town of Gorizia, the ship was laid down at the OTO Livorno shipyard in March 1930, was launched in December that year and was commissioned into the fleet in December 1931. Armed with a main battery of eight guns, she was nominally within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, though in reality she significantly exceeded this figure. During the ship's peacetime career, she frequently took part in fleet reviews. In 1934, she went on a tour with the royal yacht to eastern Africa, and she made another foreign cruise two years later to Germany during the 1936 Summer Olympics being held there. She was involved in the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s; she evacuated Italian nationals in August 1936, and while returning to Italy, suffered an explosion in an aviation gas tank that necessitated major repairs. The ship supported the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939. The ship saw extensive service in World War II, which Italy entered in June 1940. She frequently operated against British convoys to Malta in the Mediterranean, and after the North African Campaign began, she escorted Italian convoys to support the Italo- German forces fighting there. In the course of these operations, she took part in the battles at Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and First and Second Sirte. Gorizia was also attacked numerous times by Allied bombers while in port, culminating in a major raid in April 1943 that inflicted serious damage to the ship. Under repair when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, the ship was seized by occupying Germany forces, who found the ship to be unusable and so abandoned her. Italian and British frogmen tried unsuccessfully to sink the ship in 1944. After Germany's defeat in 1945, the Italian Navy determined the ship was beyond economical repair, and so she was broken up for scrap in 1947. Design Line-drawing of Pola; Gorizia was similar in appearance Gorizia was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at full load, though her displacement was nominally within the restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty. Her power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil-fired Yarrow boilers, which were trunked into two funnels amidships. Her engines were rated at and produced a top speed of . She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 292 She was protected with an armored belt that was thick amidships. Her armor deck was thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to at either end. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides. Gorizia was armed with a main battery of eight Mod 29 53-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni 40 mm/39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts. She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located in under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.Brescia, p. 76 Gorizias secondary battery was revised several times during her career. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm and 12.7 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 54-cal. guns and eight guns were installed in their place. Two 15-cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. In 1942, the star shell guns were replaced with four more 37 mm guns. The following year, a battery of fourteen guns in six twin and two single mounts replaced the machine guns. Service history Gorizia was laid down at the Odero-Terni-Orlando (OTO) shipyard in Livorno on 17 March 1930, the last member of her class. She was launched on 28 December that year, and was completed nearly a year later on 23 December 1931 when she was commissioned into the 2nd Division. She took part in naval exercises held off Naples on 13 August in honor of King Victor Emmanuel III. On the 25th, she became the flagship of the division. She participated in a naval review on 6-7 July 1933 in the Gulf of Naples for Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. On 16 September, the ship was transferred to the 1st Division, where she also served as the flagship. She received her battle flag from her namesake city on 29 June 1934. Gorizia escorted the royal yacht Savoia on a trip to the east coast of Africa in October; the tour included port calls in Berbera and Mogadishu in British and Italian Somaliland, respectively.Hogg & Wiper, p. 46 The commander of the 1st Division briefly transferred his flag to Gorizias sister ship on 31 December, before returning to Gorizia on 3 June 1935. The ship was sent to Spanish waters on 24 July 1936 to evacuate Italian nationals from the port of Gij√≥n during the Spanish Civil War. She passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 29 July and arrived in Gijon on the 31st. After embarking the Italian nationals on 1 August, Gorizia cruised to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France, where they were disembarked between 1 and 4 August. The next day, the ship departed for Germany, arriving in Kiel on 8 August for a naval review with the German heavy cruiser , the light cruiser , and the British cruiser . Gorizia remained in Kiel to show the flag during the 1936 Summer Olympics, as the sailing events for the Berlin games were held in Kiel. Gorizia at a pre-war fleet review On 19 August, Gorizia departed Kiel and steamed to Tangier, arriving five days later. After a short stop, the ship left the port, bound for Italy, but that night her forward aviation gas tank exploded, causing serious damage. She was forced to return to Tangier before proceeding to Gibraltar on 25 August for temporary repairs. While in dry dock, British officials examined the vessel and concluded that she exceeded her nominal 10,000-ton displacement, though they lodged no formal complaint for Italy's violation of the Washington Naval Treaty. The repairs were completed by 9 September, allowing Gorizia to leave Gibraltar for La Spezia, where permanent repairs would be effected. She arrived two days later; the work was completed by November, and on the 27th, she took part in a naval review for the Regent of Hungary, Mikl√≥s Horthy. Gorizia again lost her role as divisional flagship on 17 May 1937, this time being replaced by her sister . A naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples on 7 June, followed by another the following year on 5 May; the latter was to honor German dictator Adolf Hitler during his state visit to Italy. On 7 March 1939, Zara and her sister ships sortied from Taranto to intercept a squadron of Republican warships--three cruisers and eight destroyers--attempting to reach the Black Sea. The Italian ships were ordered not to open fire but merely to try to impede the progress of the Spanish ships and force them to dock at Augusta, Sicily, where they would be interned. The Spanish commander refused to stop in Augusta and instead steamed to Bizerte in French Tunisia, where his ships were interned. A month later, from 7 to 9 April, Gorizia supported the Italian invasion of Albania without incident. She was present during the visit of Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er, then the foreign minister of Francoist Spain, which had recently defeated the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. Five days later, the ship took part in the Navy Day festivities in Venice. Gorizia spent the rest of 1939 and early 1940 uneventfully. =World War II= 1940 Upon Italy's entrance into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, Gorizia was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron, which also included her sisters and Fiume and the four s.Brescia, p. 42 At the time, the division was based in Taranto; the ships were immediately sent to patrol off the island of Crete, and on 11-12 June, the ships were attacked by an unknown submarine, which the Gorizia and the destroyers unsuccessfully counterattacked. She was present at the Battle of Calabria on 9 July, and was initially stationed on the disengaged side of the Italian line. Torpedo bombers from attacked Gorizia and the other heavy cruisers, but they failed to score any hits. After the Italian battleships engaged their British counterparts, Gorizia and the other heavy cruisers steamed ahead to the front of the line and joined the attack on the leading British battleship, , but they scored no hits. A hit on the battleship that reduced her speed to forced the Italian commander to break off the engagement, as his ships could no longer keep formation. British cruisers attacked as the Italians withdrew, but heavy fire from the Italian cruisers drove them off.Greene & Massignani, pp. 70-77 On 30 July, the 1st Division escorted a convoy to Italian Libya, arriving back in Augusta on 1 August. Gunnery training off Naples followed on 16 August, and on 29 August the ships left Naples for Taranto, arriving the next day. On the 31st, the 1st Division sortied to intercept the British convoys in Operation Hats, though the Italian fleet broke off the attack without encountering the merchant ships. On 7-9 September, Gorizia patrolled off Sicily but failed to locate any British vessels, and she thereafter docked in Palermo. She returned to Taranto on the 11th and took part in gunnery training on 23 and 24 September and again on 6 November. She was present in the harbor on the night of 11-12 November during the British attack on Taranto, but was undamaged in the air raid. Her anti- aircraft batteries shot down one of the attacking British aircraft.Greene & Massignani, p. 106 The ship was transferred to Naples on the 12th. She took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, where she engaged British cruisers and shot down a British aircraft. British bombing of the port four days later forced the Italians to again relocate the cruisers, sending them temporarily to La Maddalena in Sardinia on 15 December. 1941 Gorizia painted in dazzle camouflage in 1942 Gorizia returned to Taranto in late January 1941. She conducted maneuvers with Zara on 29 January; she then went to La Spezia for periodic maintenance, which lasted from 28 February to 7 May. Pola took her place in the 1st Division, and all three of her sisters were sunk in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28 March. Since the 1st Division had been effectively wiped out at Cape Matapan, Gorizia was reassigned to the 3rd Division on 8 May, along with the three s. The ships, based in Messina, began escorting convoys to North Africa that month, the first of which took place from 26 to 28 May. Another convoy departed Italy on 25 June, escorted by Gorizia, , and a squadron of destroyers. The convoy, which consisted of requisitioned transatlantic liners, steamed to Tripoli and back, arriving in Taranto on 1 July. On 23 August, the main fleet sortied to intercept the British Force H, though they failed to locate their opponent. Over the course of 9-11 September, the British launched several air strikes on Messina, and Gorizia contributed her anti-aircraft batteries to the defense of the port. Later in the month, the British sent another convoy to reinforce Malta codenamed Operation Halberd; the Italian fleet sortied on 26 September to try to intercept it, but broke off the operation upon discovering the strength of the British escort force. On 29 September, upon returning from the failed attempt to disrupt Operation Halberd, Gorizia was sent to operate from La Maddalena, though she returned to Messina on 10 October. An Allied air attack on the port on 21 November caused extensive damage to Gorizias superstructure from bomb splinters, though she nevertheless sortied that day to escort another convoy to North Africa. On 16 and 17 December, while on another convoy escort mission, she took part in the First Battle of Sirte against a force of British light cruisers and destroyers.Hogg & Wiper, p. 47 1942 Gorizia firing her main battery during the Second Battle of Sirte While in Messina on 25 January 1942, the ship was visited by the German Luftwaffe officer Generaloberst Bruno Loerzer, who had arrived to command German air units stationed on the island. Five days later, Umberto II, the crown prince of Italy, and Hermann G√∂ring, the commander of the Luftwaffe, visited the ship on a tour of major bases in Sicily. Gorizia returned to combat operations in February; she sortied on the 14th to search for Allied shipping, but instead came under heavy attack from both torpedo bombers and submarines. She returned to Messina undamaged. On 21 February, she joined another convoy to Tripoli before returning to Messina on the 24th. A month later, on 22 March, she took part in the Second Battle of Sirte, where she was heavily engaged with British light cruisers and destroyers. The engagement occurred at long range, and smoke from the British ships interfered with the Italians' gunnery, and Gorizia scored no hits. In the course of the battle, she had fired 226 rounds from her main battery.Greene & Massignani, pp. 218-221 By May, her 203 mm guns were worn out from their use in the Battles of Sirte, and so they were relined in Messina early that month. Allied air attacks targeted the ship in Messina on 25 and 26 May, but she suffered only splinter damage. Further attacks over the following two days inflicted no damage at all. On the 28th, she left Messina for Taranto; although Allied aircraft continued to attack Gorizia there from 8 to 11 June, she remained unscathed. On 15 June, the fleet sortied once again to intercept a convoy to Malta, codenamed Operation Vigorous. While on the mission, Gorizias floatplane failed to return and was presumed lost. British torpedo bombers attacked Gorizia three times, but failed to score any hits. The cruiser was hit by a torpedo and was later sunk by a British submarine. On 5 July, Gorizia returned to Messina, and on the 17th, she hosted a visit from Umberto II. While she was on an operation to catch a British convoy on 11-13 August, a British submarine attempted to torpedo the ship while she slowed down to launch one of her floatplanes. She successfully evaded the attack, but the cruisers and were not as lucky, both being badly damaged. Gorizia, Trieste, and two destroyers proceeded on to Messina while the other five destroyers stayed to protect the two damaged cruisers.Greene & Massignani, pp. 255-257 Umberto II made another visit to the ship on 27 August in Messina. Fate Gorizia abandoned at the end of the war. By December, the threat from Allied bombers had increased significantly, forcing the Regia Marina to abandon Messina as a major base. On 9 December, the 3rd Division left for La Maddalena further north in Sardinia, arriving the next day. Nevertheless, a major attack from USAAF heavy bombers struck La Maddalena on 10 April 1943 and sank and hit Gorizia with three bombs, inflicting serious damage. One bomb penetrated the rear superfiring turret and exploded inside and the other two struck the deck abreast of the superstructure on the port side. Near misses breached the hull below the waterline, but damage control parties kept flooding to a minimum. Two days after the attack, Gorizia steamed to La Spezia for repairs. On 19 April, an Allied air attack on the port inflicted minor splinter damage. Umberto II made another visit to the ship while she was awaiting repair on 20 April. Ten days later, the 3rd Division was disbanded, since the two surviving Italian heavy cruisers were out of action,Bolzano having been torpedoed and badly damaged by a British submarine in August 1942.Hogg & Wiper, p. 62 Gorizia entered the dry dock in La Spezia to begin repairs on 4 May; she was still under repair when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September. The ship's commander initially ordered the caretaker crew to flood the drydock and scuttle the ship when German troops occupied the port, but cancelled the order when it became clear the ship would be of no use to the Germans anyway. The Germans later moved the ship out of the dock, anchored her in the harbor, and abandoned her. On the night of 21-22 June 1944, British and Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedoes to infiltrate the harbor to sink Gorizia and Bolzano to prevent the Germans from using them as blockships; while the commandos did sink Bolzano, they were unsuccessful with Gorizia. She remained afloat and heavily listing in April 1945, when Allied forces liberated La Spezia. Judged to be too badly damaged to repair, the postwar navy decided to discard the ship. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 27 February 1947 and broken up for scrap.

E.d. R.S.S. (1672‚Äì1743), was a pioneering physician, early proto-psychiatrist, philosopher and mathematician. Life George Cheyne (1672-1743) was a Newtonian physician and Behmenist, deeply immersed in mysticism. Born in 1672 in Methlick, near Aberdeen in Scotland, he was baptized in Mains of Kelly, Methlick, Aberdeenshire, on 24 February 1673. He died in Bath on April 12, 1743. The books he published during his life show his wide interest which extended from medicine and natural philosophy to religion, metaphysics, astronomy and mathematics. His books were most of the time very successful and as a result they were translated into other languages, e.g. Latin, Dutch, French, Italian and German.Guerini, Anita, Obesity and Depression in the Enlightenment, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 2000, pp. 239-243. Joling-van der Sar, Gerda J., The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson: Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth- Century English Novelist, 2003, footnote 293, p. 81. The printer and author Samuel Richardson printed several of his books. Among many others Thomas Gray, Samuel Johnson, John Wesley, John ByromSee the Catalogue of Byrom‚Äôs library for books written by Cheyne, https://archive.org/details/acataloguelibra00roddgoog/page/n63 and Edward Young liked his work. His clients included Alexander Pope, John Gay and Samuel Richardson. Today he is best known for his contribution to vegetarianism. Cheyne was acquainted with Sir Isaac Newton and provoked Newton to publish his Quadratures and with it, his Light & Colours. Newton later offered him financial support to publish Fluxionum methodus inversa (The Inverse Method of Fluxions), but apparently he turned down the offer. Newton refused to see him any more.Never at Rest, Richard S. Westfall, p. 639 ) Cheyne did not believe that the present state of things is \\"from all Eternity\\". Using the metaphor of \\"a Piece of Clock-work\\",Cheyne, George, The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed, published in 1705 (Part I), p. 143. he argues that when a thing depends upon another thing as its cause, this implies that ‚Äúthe first thing exists that the second may exist‚Äù. He adds: \\"remove the sun and there will be no fruit, take away the moon and the seas would stagnate, destroy our Atmosphere and we should swell like poison¬¥d Rats\\".Cheyne, George, The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed, published in 1705 (Part I), pp. 145-146. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible, according to Cheyne, that ‚Äúany of the Species of Animals or Vegetables should have existed from all Eternity‚Äù.Cheyne, George, The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed, published in 1705 (Part I), p. 168. Cheyne also wrote on fevers, nervous disorders, and hygiene. In 1740 he wrote The Essay on Regimen and this work is often quoted by vegetarians and animal rights activists, particularly the following passage: > To see the convulsions, agonies and tortures of a poor fellow-creature, whom > they cannot restore nor recompense, dying to gratify luxury and tickle > callous and rank organs, must require a rocky heart, and a great degree of > cruelty and ferocity. I cannot find any great difference between feeding on > human flesh and feeding on animal flesh, except custom and practice.Cheyne, > George, The Essay on Regimen, 1740, p. 70. Speaking from personal experience, Cheyne asserted that mental depression afflicted the brilliant rather than the dull, writing that \\"those of the liveliest and quickest natural Parts ... whose Genius is most keen and penetrating were most prone to such disorders. Fools, weak or stupid Persons, heavy and dull Souls, are seldom troubled with Vapours or Lowness of Spirits.\\" Education Cheyne went to the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen to study medicine. During these years he may have spent a brief time in Leiden.Anita Guerrini, \\"James Keill, George Cheyne, and Newtonian Physiology, 1690-1740\\", in the Journal of the History of Biology, 18, 1985, p. 254 and in Obesity and Depression in the Enlightenment: The Life and Times of George Cheyne, Oklahoma, 2000, p. 30 and p. 198, n. 43. Having finished his studies he went to London in 1701 where he started a practice and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1702. Cheyne describes his own life up to 1733 in The English Malady.The English Malady, 3rd ed., 1734, pp. 325-364. Cheyne's Family Life Cheyne married Margaret Middleton around 1712 or earlier. They had three surviving children, Francis, who was baptized on 23 August 1713 at St Michael's parish in Bath, Peggy (Margaret), and John, possibly born in 1717. John became vicar of Brigstock in Northamptonshire.Gerda J. Joling-van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist, 2003, p. 63. Practice in Bath and London In the summer Cheyne worked in Bath and in the winter at London. However, in 1718 he decided to give up his practice in London to settle in Bath permanently.G.D. Henderson, Mystics of the North-East, Including I. Letters of James Keith, M.D., and Others to Lord Deskford; II. Correspondence between Dr. George Garden and James Cunningham, Aberdeen, 1934, pp. 75, 99, 105, 141. Roy Porter refers to Cheyne as one of the originators of the neurological school of psychiatry.Roy Porter, George Cheyne: The English Malady (1733), London, 1990. See also Porter's Mind-forged Manacles: A History of Madness in England from the Restoration to the Regency, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1987 and Porter‚Äôs Discovering the History of Psychiatry, Oxford, 1994. Though appreciated by many, Cheyne was sometimes the subject of banter as appears from the following poem, which appeared in the 1730s (reprinted in 1757 in the London Magazine). The reference to Cheyne‚Äôs weight was based on the fact that Cheyne with 32 stone (almost 203 kg) was seriously overweight. After an illness Cheyne lost almost 10 stone.Joling-van der Sar, Gerda J., The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson: Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist, 2003, p. 45. ::Tell me from whom, fat-headed Scot ::Thou didst thy system learn ::From Hippocrate thou hast it not ::Nor Celsus, nor Pitcairne. ::Suppose we own that milk is good ::And say the same of grass ::The one for babes is only food ::The other for an ass. ::Doctor! One new prescription try ::(A friend's advice forgive;) ::Eat grass, reduce thyself, and die ::Thy patients then may live. Cheyne‚Äôs reply was: ::My system, Doctor, is my own ::No tutor I pretend ::My blunders hurt myself alone ::But yours your dearest friend. ::Were you to milk and straw confin'd ::Thrice happy might you be ::Perhaps you might regain your mind ::And from your wit get free. ::I cannot your prescription try ::But heartily \\"forgive\\" ::'Tis nat'ral you should bid me die ::That you yourself may live. Cheyne‚Äôs Admiration for William Law and Jakob B√∂hme Cheyne‚Äôs admiration for William Law appeared in a letter to Samuel Richardson, his friend and the printer of several of his books. Cheyne was also his physician. The two men corresponded on a very regular basis from 1734 to the year of Cheyne‚Äôs death in 1743.Gerda J. Joling- van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist, 2003, p. 37. In his letter of 9 March 1742 Cheyne enthusiastically asked Richardson whether he had ‚Äúseen Law's Appeal?\\" and he described The Appeal as \\"admirable and unanswerable\\". Moreover, he wished all the Methodists \\"might get it by Heart\\".Charles F. Mullett, The Letters of Doctor George Cheyne to Samuel Richardson (1733-1743), Vol. XVIII, No. 1, Columbia, 1943, p. 88.Gerda J. Joling-van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English Novelist, 2003, p. 117. Cheyne referred here to The Appeal to all that Doubt, or Disbelieve the Truths of the Gospel, whether they be Deists, Arians, Socinians, or Nominal Christians, which had been written by William Law in 1740. A few weeks later Cheyne wrote in a letter dated 26 April 1742 that Law had already sent him the Regeneration (The Grounds and Reasons of Christian Regeneration, published in 1739) as well as the Appeal. He would, however, very much appreciate it if Richardson could ask the London bookseller William Innys to get all Law's works send to him: > I have had but too much of your Compliments and Gratitude, and instead of > your thinking yourself in my Debt for any Thing I can do for you, I have > always thought myself in Yours. Remember the Catechism, Mr. Baillie's > Character, ‚Ä¶ but to ease your hyppish, honest, grateful Heart, if you'll get > Innys to gather all Mr. Law's Pieces, all he ever wrote or published or is > reckoned his, and get them handsomely bound and send them to me, I will keep > them in my Family and Library as an eternal Remembrance of you and him, whom > I know to be the greatest best Man, and the most solid and deep of this > Island. I have most of his larger Pieces already sent by himself, his Appeal > and Regeneration lately.Charles F. Mullett, The Letters of Doctor George > Cheyne to Samuel Richardson (1733-1743), Vol. XVIII, No. 1, Columbia, 1943, > p. 93.Gerda J. Joling-van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, > Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English > Novelist, 2003, p. 120. In a footnote to his letter to Richardson of 17 May 1742 Cheyne mentioned that he had received Richardson's \\"most valuable Present of Mr. Law's Works\\". A few months later Samuel Richardson sent one of Jakob B√∂hme‚Äôs works as a gift to Cheyne, as is testified in Cheyne‚Äôs letter of 29 August 1742. Cheyne wrote: > I thank you for your Jacob Behemen [sic]; you will never have done with your > Bribes. I wish I could do for you what you want and desire. All I can say, > without Bribe or Entreaty, of mere Love and good Will, I shall ever do my > best for you, and I shall beg of God to direct me in this > particularly.Charles F. Mullett, The Letters of Doctor George Cheyne to > Samuel Richardson (1733-1743), Vol. XVIII, No. 1, Columbia, 1943, p. > 107.Gerda J. Joling-van der Sar, The Spiritual Side of Samuel Richardson, > Mysticism, Behmenism and Millenarianism in an Eighteenth-Century English > Novelist, 2003, p. 142. Cheyne may have referred here to any of Boehme's works which had been translated into English during 1645-1662 by John Sparrow, John Ellistone, Humphrey Blunden and Charles Hotham. The Importance of Exercise Cheyne was always stressing to his patients the importance of exercise. In winter and bad weather he advised within doors the tremoussoir (or chamber-horse), or walking in a gallery or a suite of rooms, and in good weather any of the exercises mentioned in his earlier works such as walking, riding, fencing, dancing, billiards, tennis, football and digging, of which Cheyne thought walking the most natural, and riding, as it shakes the \\"whole Machine\\", the most manly, healthy and least laborious.Essay of Health and Long Life, (1724), p. 94. The eighth edition had been printed by Samuel Richardson in 1734. The valetudinarian might choose the ones suited to the weakness of his organs or limbs. Cheyne also stressed the importance of exercise for women. Even pregnant women should not be confined to their chambers, couches or beds. The only solid and certain way to prevent miscarriages was to pursue all those means and methods likeliest to promote good health, such as air and gentle exercise. All violence or excess was of course to be carefully avoided, but fresh air, gentle exercise and walking was as necessary as food or rest, according to Cheyne. However, exercise ought to be constant and uniform, and never to be performed on a full stomach, nor should they be violent, or long at a time, but orderly at proper hours: \\"not to Sweating, but to Warmth\\".George Cheyne, The Natural Method of Cureing the Diseases of the Body and the Disorders of the Mind, printed by Samuel Richardson in 1742, pp. 257-258, 292, 301. How to Obtain a Green Old Age To obtain what Cheyne called a \\"Green Old Age\\", he advised a wise man who wanted to live on to seventy or eighty to begin at least at the age of fifty to lessen his daily intake of meat and drink, especially in quantity. This was because about this time the \\"great Crise or Climacteric of Life\\" generally began in both sexes. For it was then, Cheyne argued, that the blood and the juices of the most healthy and strong began to cool, to thicken and were becoming \\"vapid\\" and obstructed in the \\"Capillaries and Lymphatics\\". As a result many of these vessels coalesced and became cartilaginous‚Äù.George Cheyne, The Natural Method of Cureing the Diseases of the Body and the Disorders of the Mind, (1742), pp. 295-296. Aversion of Pain Cheyne had a deep aversion against pain. He concluded The English Malady (1733) by stating that he was one of those \\"mean- spirited Wretches\\" who was content to live as long as nature designed him to last and that he would submit with the utmost peace and resignation he could arrive at when his life had to end. But pain, sickness, and especially oppression, anxiety and lowness were his \\"mortal Aversion\\" and he added that he would refuse no means to avoid them, except those that would bring him even greater suffering. For he knew there were as many and different degrees of sensibility or of feeling as there were degrees of intelligence and perception in human beings. One perhaps suffered more from the \\"Prick of a Pin\\" than others from being \\"run through their Body\\", and the first sort seemed to be of the class of the \\"Quick-Thinkers\\". None could, however, choose for themselves their own particular frame of mind, nor constitution of body, just as they could not choose their own degree of sensibility, for that was given by the \\"Author of his Nature\\", and was already determined. Both were as various as the faces and forms of mankind.George Cheyne, The English Malady, 1733, pp. 366-367. Vegetarianism In order to succeed in medical practice, Cheyne tried to develop a rapport with his patients by regularly visiting the local taverns where they spent time, a practice common among medical practitioners of the day. He became a popular figure of local social life, and the quantity of rich food and drink he consumed in consequence left him grossly obese and very unhealthy. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and regained his health. But when he returned to a more typical diet - albeit more moderate than he had previously indulged - he regained weight and his health once again deteriorated. He went back to his vegetarian diet for the remainder of his life, recommending it for everyone suffering from obesity. Cheyne was an early advocate of lacto-vegetarianism.Kiple, Kenneth F; Ornelas, Kriemhild Cone√®. (2000). The Cambridge World History of Food, Volume 2. Cambridge University Press. p. 1556. He promoted his milk and vegetable diet to treat obesity and other health problems.Beatty, Heather R. (2012). Nervous Disease in Late Eighteenth-Century Britain: The Reality of a Fashionable Disorder. Routledge. pp. 103-104. Cheyne wrote about it in An Essay of Health and Long Life, first published in 1724. His diet was criticized by the medical community of his time but was a huge success and his book went through four editions in its first year alone. Main Works The subjects in Cheyne¬¥s books were of a medical, philosophical and mathematical nature, but certain metaphysical and religious issues of the day, combining Enlightenment objectives with ideas in mystical and radical Pietism, played an important part. His writings, which often went through several editions, were translated into Latin, Dutch, French, Italian and German. His main works are: * The Philosophical Principles of Religion Natural and Revealed, 1705 (Part I) and 1715 (Part II) which is mainly concerned with metaphysical matters or the spirit. The first part contained \\"the Elements of Natural Philosophy and the Proofs for Natural Religion arising from them\\". Part II contained \\"the Nature and Kinds of Infinites; their Arithmetick and Uses, and the Philosophick Principles of Revealed Religion\\". * Observations concerning the Nature and due Method of treating the Gout, 1720, which deals with physical matters or the body. In this book Cheyne shares his \\"Observations concerning the Nature and due Method of treating the Gout, ‚Ä¶ together with an account of the Nature and qualities of the Bath Waters\\". * The Essay of Health and Long Life, 1724, which is equally focussed on physical matters or the body. In the Preface Cheyne wrote that he had consulted nothing but his ‚Äúown Experience and Observation on my own crazy Carcase and the Infirmities of others I have treated‚Äù. In the first chapter Cheyne wrote that it was easier to preserve health than to recover it, and to prevent diseases than to cure them. * The English Malady, 1733, which discusses nervous diseases of all kinds. The subtitle of the work was a Treatise of Nervous Diseases of all kinds, Spleen, Vapours, Lowness of Spirits, Hypochondraical, and Hysterical Distempers, etc.\\" * The Essay on Regimen, 1740, which discusses metaphysical matters, but physical matters as well. It was especially meant for Cheyne's \\"fellow- sufferers, the gouty, consumptive, or nervous valetudinarian-low-livers\\". * The Natural Method of Cureing [sic] the Diseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind depending on the Body, 1742, which is mainly concerned with physical matters, but sometimes also with metaphysical matters. It was his last work and became very popular (five editions).

Born in Vireda, J√∂nk√∂ping County, Sweden, he was the son of a Church of Sweden pastor. As student at Uppsala University, he gave up theology for a career in philosophy. Teaching there from 1893 until his retirement in 1933, he attacked the then dominant philosophical idealism of the followers of Christopher Jacob Bostr√∂m (1797-1866). He is best known as a founder of the (quasi-) positivistic Uppsala school of philosophy--the Swedish counterpart of the Anglo-American Analytical Philosophy as well as of the Logical Positivism of the Vienna Circle--and as the founder of the Scandinavian legal realism movement. Some of his work was published by the Muirhead Library of Philosophy. He was Inspektor of the √ñstg√∂ta nation from 1925 to his retirement in 1933. Contribution to legal understanding The jurisprudential camp of legal realism, broadly speaking, consists of those scholars who strictly reject the concept of natural law and who believe that legal concepts, terminology and values should be based on experience, observation and experimentation and are thus, ‚Äòreal‚Äô. H√§gerstr√∂m is considered to be the founding father of the Scandinavian school of legal realism. His disciples Karl Olivecrona, Alf Ross and Anders Vilhelm Lundstedt all take a similar basic view to H√§gerstr√∂m in their opinions on the language of Western law. Due to their verdict on natural law, they also reject the concept of human rights. H√§gerstr√∂m, who had been influenced by the Neo- Kantianism of the Marburg school, rejected metaphysics in their entirety. His motto was: \\"Praeterea censeo metaphysicam esse delendam\\", paraphrasing Cato's famous \\"delenda Carthago\\". His opinion was that words such as ‚Äòright‚Äô and ‚Äòduty‚Äô were basically meaningless as they could not be scientifically verified or proven. They may have influence or be able to direct a person who obtains such a right or duty but ultimately, if they could not stand up to a factual test, they were mere fantasies. Similarly, H√§gerstr√∂m regarded all value judgements as mere emotional expressions using the form of judgements without being judgments in the proper sense of the word. This position caused H√§gerstr√∂m's critics to characterize his philosophy as \\"value nihilism\\" - a label that was invented by journalists and later endorsed by some of H√§gerstr√∂m's less orthodox followers, namely Ingemar Hedenius. H√§gerstr√∂m attacked various words and legal concepts in his writings so as to prove they could not stand up to scientific application.

It is commonly known as the Lewis model after its inventor W. Arthur Lewis. It explains the growth of a developing economy in terms of a labour transition between two sectors, the capitalist sector and the subsistence sector. History Initially the dual-sector model as given by W. Arthur Lewis was enumerated in his article entitled \\"Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor\\" written in 1954, the model itself was named in Lewis's honor. First published in The Manchester School in May 1954, the article and the subsequent model were instrumental in laying the foundation for the field of development economics. The article itself has been characterized by some as the most influential contribution to the establishment of the discipline. Assumptions # The model assumes that a developing economy has a surplus of unproductive labor in the agricultural sector. # These workers are attracted to the growing manufacturing sector where higher wages are offered. # It also assumes that the wages in the manufacturing sector are more or less fixed. # Entrepreneurs in the manufacturing sector make profit because they charge a price above the fixed wage rate. # The model assumes that these profits will be reinvested in the business in the form of fixed capital. # An advanced manufacturing sector means an economy has moved from a traditional to an industrialized one. W. A. Lewis divided the economy of an underdeveloped country into 2 sectors: =The capitalist sector= Lewis defined this sector as \\"that part of the economy which uses reproducible capital and pays capitalists thereof\\". The use of capital is controlled by the capitalists, who hire the services of labour. It includes manufacturing, plantations, mines etc. The capitalist sector may be private or public. =The subsistence sector= This sector was defined by him as \\"that part of the economy which is not using reproducible capital\\". It can also be adjusted as the indigenous traditional sector or the \\"self employed sector\\". The per head output is comparatively lower in this sector and this is because it is not fructified with capital. The \\"Dual Sector Model\\" is a theory of development in which surplus labor from traditional agricultural sector is transferred to the modern industrial sector whose growth over time absorbs the surplus labour, promotes industrialization and stimulates sustained development. In the model, the subsistence agricultural sector is typically characterized by low wages, an abundance of labour, and low productivity through a labour-intensive production process. In contrast, the capitalist manufacturing sector is defined by higher wage rates as compared to the subsistence sector, higher marginal productivity, and a demand for more workers. Also, the capitalist sector is assumed to use a production process that is capital intensive, so investment and capital formation in the manufacturing sector are possible over time as capitalists' profits are reinvested in the capital stock. Improvement in the marginal productivity of labour in the agricultural sector is assumed to be a low priority as the hypothetical developing nation's investment is going towards the physical capital stock in the manufacturing sector. =Relationship between the two sectors= The primary relationship between the two sectors is that when the capitalist sector expands, it extracts or draws labour from the subsistence sector. This causes the output per head of labourers who move from the subsistence sector to the capitalist sector to increase. Since Lewis in his model considers overpopulated labour surplus economies he assumes that the supply of unskilled labour to the capitalist sector is unlimited. This gives rise to the possibility of creating new industries and expanding existing ones at the existing wage rate. A large portion of the unlimited supply of labor consists of those who are in disguised unemployment in agriculture and in other over-manned occupations such as domestic services casual jobs, petty retail trading. Lewis also accounts for two other factors that cause an increase in the supply of unskilled labour, they are women in the household and population growth. The agricultural sector has a limited amount of land to cultivate, the marginal product of an additional farmer is assumed to be zero as the law of diminishing marginal returns has run its course due to the fixed input, land. As a result, the agricultural sector has a quantity of farm workers that are not contributing to agricultural output since their marginal productivities are zero. This group of farmers that is not producing any output is termed surplus labour since this cohort could be moved to another sector with no effect on agricultural output. (The term surplus labour here is not being used in a Marxist context and only refers to the unproductive workers in the agricultural sector.) Therefore, due to the wage differential between the capitalist and subsistence sector, workers will tend to transition from the agricultural to the manufacturing sector over time to reap the reward of higher wages. However even though the marginal product of labor is zero, it still shares a part in the total product and receives approximately the average product. If a quantity of workers moves from the subsistence to the capitalist sector equal to the quantity of surplus labour in the subsistence sector, regardless of who actually transfers, general welfare and productivity will improve. Total agricultural product will remain unchanged while total industrial product increases due to the addition of labour, but the additional labour also drives down marginal productivity and wages in the manufacturing sector. Over time as this transition continues to take place and investment results in increases in the capital stock, the marginal productivity of workers in the manufacturing will be driven up by capital formation and driven down by additional workers entering the manufacturing sector. Eventually, the wage rates of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors will equalize as workers leave the agriculture sector for the manufacturing sector, increasing marginal productivity and wages in agriculture whilst driving down productivity and wages in manufacturing. The end result of this transition process is that the agricultural wage equals the manufacturing wage, the agricultural marginal product of labour equals the manufacturing marginal product of labour, and no further manufacturing sector enlargement takes place as workers no longer have a monetary incentive to transition. Surplus labour and the growth of the economy Surplus labour can be used instead of capital in the creation of new industrial investment projects, or it can be channeled into nascent industries, which are labour-intensive in their early stages. Such growth does not raise the value of the subsistence wage, because the supply of labor exceeds the demand at that wage, and rising production via improved labour techniques has the effect of lowering the capital coefficient. Although labour is assumed to be in surplus, it is mainly unskilled. This inhibits growth since technical progress necessary for growth requires skilled labor. But should there be a labor surplus and a modest capital, this bottleneck can be broken through the provision of training and education facilities. The utility of unlimited supplies of labour to growth objectives depends upon the amount of capital available at the same time. Should there be surplus labour, agriculture will derive no productive use from it, so a transfer to a non agriculture sector will be of mutual benefit. It provides jobs to the agrarian population and reduces the burden of population from land. Industry now obtains its labour. Labour must be encouraged to move to increase productivity in agriculture. To start such a movement, the capitalist sector will have to pay a compensatory payment determined by the wage rate that people can earn outside their present sector, plus a set of other amounts includes the cost of living in the new sector and changes in the level of profits in the existing sector. The margin capitalists may have to pay is as much as 30 per cent above the average subsistence wage, WW1 in figure which represents the capitalist sector is shown by N; OW is the industrial wage. Given the profit maximization assumption, employment of labor within the industrial sector is given by the point where marginal product is equal to the rate of wages, i.e. OM. 450px Since the wages in the capitalist sector depend on the earnings of the subsistence sector, capitalists would like to keep down productivity/wages in the subsistence sector, so that the capitalist sector may expand at a fixed wage. In the capitalist sector labor is employed up to the point where its marginal product equals wage, since a capitalist employer would be reducing his surplus if he paid labor more than he received for what is produced. But this need not be true in subsistence agriculture as wages could be equal to average product or the level of subsistence. The total product labor ONPM is divided between the payments to labor in the form of wages, OWPM, and the capitalist surplus, NPW. The growth of the capitalist sector and the rate of labor absorption from the subsistence sector depends on the use made of capitalist surplus. When the surplus is reinvested, the total product of labor will rise. The marginal product line shifts upwards to the right, that is to N1. Assuming wages are constant, the industrial sector now provides more employment. Hence employment rises by MM1. The amount of capitalist surplus goes up from WNP to WN1P'. This amount can now be reinvested and the process will be repeated and all the surplus labor would eventually be exhausted. When all the surplus labor in the subsistence sector has been attracted into the capitalist sector, wages in the subsistence sector will begin to rise, shifting the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, and causing wages in the capitalist sector to rise. Capital accumulation has caught up with the population and there is no longer scope for development from the initial source, i.e. unlimited supplies of labor. When all the surplus labor is exhausted, the supply of labor to the industrial sector becomes less than perfectly elastic. It is now in the interests of producers in the subsistence sector to compete for labor as the agricultural sector has become fully commercialized. It is the increase in the share of profits in the capitalist sector which ensures that labor surplus is continuously utilized and eventually exhausted. Real wages will tend to rise along with increases in productivity and the economy will enter into a stage of self-sustaining growth with a consistent nature. Capital accumulation The process of economic growth is inextricably linked to the growth of capitalist surplus, that is as long as the capitalist surplus increases, the national income also increases raising the growth of the economy. The increase in capitalist surplus is linked to the use of more and more labor which is assumed to be in surplus in case of this model. This process of capital accumulation does come to an end at some point. This point is where capital accumulation catches up with population so that there is no longer any surplus labor left. Lewis says that the point where capital accumulation comes to a stop can come before also that is if real wages rise so high so as to reduce capitalists' profits to the level at which profits are all consumed and there is no net investment. This can take place in the following ways: # If the capital accumulation is proceeding faster than population growth which causes a decline in the number of people in the agricultural or subsistence sector. # The increase in the size of the capitalist or industrial sector in comparison to the subsistence sector may turn the terms of trade against the capitalist sector and therefore force the capitalists to pay the workers/laborers a higher percentage of their product in order to keep their real income constant. # The subsistence sector may adopt new and improved methods and techniques of production, this will raise the level of subsistence wages in turn forcing an increase in the capitalist wages. Thus both the surplus of the capitalists and the rate of capital accumulation will then decline. #Even though the productivity of capitalist sector remains unchanged, the workers in the capitalist sector may begin to imitate the capitalist style and way of life and therefore may need more to live on, this will raise the subsistence wage and also the capitalist wage and in turn the capitalist surplus and the rate of capital accumulation will decline. Criticism The Lewis model has attracted attention of underdeveloped countries because it brings out some basic relationships in dualistic development. However it has been criticized on the following grounds: # Economic development takes place via the absorption of labor from the subsistence sector where opportunity costs of labor are very low. However, if there are positive opportunity costs, e.g. loss of crops in times of peak harvesting season, labor transfer will reduce agricultural output. # Absorption of surplus labor itself may end prematurely because competitors may raise wage rates and lower the share of profit. It has been shown that rural- urban migration in the Egyptian economy was accompanied by an increase in wage rates of 15 per cent and a fall in profits of 12 per cent. Wages in the industrial sector were forced up directly by unions and indirectly through demands for increased wages in the subsistence sector, as payment for increased productivity. In fact, given the urban-rural wage differential in most poor countries, large scale unemployment is now seen in both the urban and rural sectors. # The Lewis model underestimates the full impact on the poor economy of a rapidly growing population, i.e. its effects on agriculture surplus, the capitalist profit share, wage rates and overall employment opportunities. Similarly, Lewis assumed that the rate of growth in manufacturing would be identical to that in agriculture, but if industrial development involves more intensive use of capital than labor, then the flow of labor from agriculture to industry will simply create more unemployment. # Lewis seems to have ignored the balanced growth between agriculture and industry. Given the linkages between agricultural growth and industrial expansion in poor countries, if a section of the profit made by the capitalists is not devoted to agricultural development, the process of industrialization would be jeopardized. # Possible leakages from the economy seem to have been ignored by Lewis. He assumes boldly that a capitalist's marginal propensity to save is close to one, but a certain increase in consumption always accompanies an increase in profits, so the total increment of savings will be somewhat less than increments in profit. Whether or not capitalist surplus will be used constructively will depend on the consumption- saving patterns of the top 10 percent of the population. But capitalists alone are not the only productive agents of society. Small farmers producing cash crops in Egypt have shown themselves to be quite capable of saving the required capital. The world's largest cocoa industry in Ghana is entirely the creation of small enterprise capital formation. # The transfer of unskilled workers from agriculture to industry is regarded as almost smooth and costless, but this does not occur in practice because industry requires different types of labor. The problem can be solved by investment in education and skill formation, but the process is neither smooth nor inexpensive. The model assumes rationality, perfect information and unlimited capital formation in industry. These do not exist in practical situations and so the full extent of the model is rarely realised. However, the model does provide a good general theory on labour transitioning in developing economies. Empirical tests and practical application of the Lewis model # Empirical evidence does not always provide much support for the Lewis model. Theodore Schultz in an empirical study of a village in India during the influenza epidemic of 1918‚Äì19 showed that agricultural output declined, although his study does not prove whether output would have declined had a comparable proportion of the agricultural population left for other occupations in response to economic incentive. Again disguised unemployment may be present in one sector of the economy but not in others. Further, empirically it is important to know not only whether the marginal productivity is equal to zero, but also the amount of surplus labor and the effect of its withdrawal on output. # The Lewis model was applied to the Egyptian economy by Mabro in 1967 and despite the proximity of Lewis's assumptions to the realities of the Egyptian situation during the period of study, the model failed firstly because Lewis seriously underestimated the rate of population growth and secondly because the choice of capital intensiveness in Egyptian industries did not show much labor using bias and as such, the level of unemployment did not show any tendency to register significant decline. # The validity of the Lewis model was again called into question when it was applied to Taiwan. It was observed that, despite the impressive rate of growth of the economy of Taiwan, unemployment did not fall appreciably and this is explained again in reference to the choice of capital intensity in industries in Taiwan. This raised the important issue whether surplus labor is a necessary condition for growth. This model has been employed quite successfully in Singapore. Ironically however it has not been employed in Sir Arthur Lewis' home country of St. Lucia.

Concordances have been compiled only for works of special importance, such as the Vedas, Bible, Qur'an or the works of Shakespeare, James Joyce or classical Latin and Greek authors, because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-computer era. Mordecai Nathan's Hebrew- Latin Concordance of the Bible Concordance are more than an index; they include additional material, such as commentary, definitions and topical cross-indexing, which makes producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers. In the precomputing era, search technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as latent semantic indexing have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context. A bilingual concordance is a concordance based on aligned parallel text. A topical concordance is a list of subjects that a book covers (usually The Bible), with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The best-known topical concordance is Nave's Topical Bible. The first Bible concordance was compiled for the Vulgate Bible by Hugh of St Cher (d.1262), who employed 500 friars to assist him. In 1448, Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. A concordance to the Greek New Testament was published in 1599 by Henry Stephens, and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English Bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden, it did not employ the verse numbers devised by Robert Stephens in 1545, but \\"the pretty large concordance\\" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed Cruden's Concordance and Strong's Concordance. Use in linguistics Concordances are frequently used in linguistics, when studying a text. For example: * comparing different usages of the same word * analysing keywords * analysing word frequencies * finding and analysing phrases and idioms * finding translations of subsentential elements, e.g. terminology, in bitexts and translation memories * creating indexes and word lists (also useful for publishing) Concordancing techniques are widely used in national text corpora such as American National Corpus, British National Corpus, and Corpus of Contemporary American English available on-line. Stand- alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as concordancersIntroduction to WordSmith or more advanced corpus managers. Some of them have integrated part-of-speech taggers and enable the user to create his/her own POS-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics. Inversion The reconstruction of the text of some of the Dead Sea Scrolls involved a concordance. Access to some of the scrolls was governed by a \\"secrecy rule\\" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of Roland de Vaux in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by Martin Abegg in 1991, who used a computer to \\"invert\\" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents. This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.

The complex contains of office space, and consists of two towers, Bay Wellington Tower and TD Canada Trust Tower, linked by the Allen Lambert Galleria. Brookfield Place is also the home of the Hockey Hall of Fame (housed in an opulent former bank from 1885).  Design  The TD Canada Trust Tower is noted for its recessed design and spire on the upper levels and stands at 53 storeys. Designed by Bregman + Hamann Architects and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the tower was completed in 1990 and was known as the Canada Trust Tower until 2000 when Toronto-Dominion Bank purchased Canada Trust. Canada Trust signage was atop the spire of building until 2000 when it was replaced by \\"TD\\" logo. Until July 2015, the \\"TD\\" logo in the downtown Toronto skyline was solely displayed on the Canada Trust Tower, unlike the nearby towers of the Toronto-Dominion Centre which lacked signage. Bay Wellington Tower is a 49-story office tower, designed by Bregman + Hamann Architects and completed in 1992. Architecturally it is meant to complement the Canada Trust Tower; for instance parts of the Bay Wellington Tower are recessed while that of the Canada Trust Tower would protrude out and vice versa, and the Bay Wellington Tower has a twin peak or double spires compared to the Canada Trust Tower's single spire. Allen Lambert Galleria, designed by Santiago Calatrava Brookfield Place at night.  Allen Lambert Galleria  Intertwining steel arches at Sam Pollock Square Allen Lambert Galleria, sometimes described as the \\"crystal cathedral of commerce\\", is an atrium designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava which connects Bay Street with Sam Pollock Square. The six story high pedestrian thoroughfare is structured by eight freestanding supports on each side of the Galleria, which branch out into parabolic shapes evoking a forest canopy or a tree-lined avenue because of the presence of building facades along the sides of the structure. The Galleria was the result of an international competition and was incorporated into the development in order to satisfy the City of Toronto's public art requirements. It is a frequently photographed space, and is heavily featured as a backdrop for news reports, as well as TV and film productions. The parabolic arched roof that Santiago Calatrava created for the assembly hall of the Wohlen High School in Wohlen, Aargau, Switzerland, is generally considered to be a precursor of the vaulted, parabolic ceiling in the Galleria. Ownership Brookfield Place serves as the headquarters for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the Bay Wellington Tower section of the complex. The TD Tower section was owned in entirety by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) through its subsidiary Oxford Properties. In late 2012 or early 2013, OMERS and an unconfirmed entity identified in news reports as the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP) completed a swap transaction in which OMERS reduced its ownership stake in the tower to 50%. According to the Financial Post, \\"A spokesman for PSP would not confirm the deal had taken place, noting the pension fund never comments on any transaction.\\" The swap valued the 50% stake in the tower at C$465 million, or C$750 per square foot, a record for commercial property in Canada. Hockey Hall of Fame The building now used for the Hall, as a Bank of Montreal branch in the 1890s The Hockey Hall of Fame is at the corner of Front and Yonge Streets in downtown Toronto. The same building also houses the IIHF Hall of Fame.

Description Reddy Kilowatt is drawn as a stick figure whose body, limbs, and hair are made of stylized lightning-bolts and whose bulbous head has a light bulb for a nose and wall outlets for ears.Earlier renditions used a two-hole, NEMA-1 style receptacle; later, 3-hole NEMA-5-style grounded receptacles were represented. In other countries, representations of receptacles in local use were substituted. Conception Reddy Kilowatt made his first published appearance on March 14, 1926 in an advertisement in The Birmingham News for the Alabama Power Company (APC). The character was the brainchild of the company's 40-year-old commercial manager, Ashton B. Collins, Sr. Like other electric utilities of the period, APC was seeking to grow consumer demand for electrical power. Commercially viable AC generating stations had begun powering North American streets and homes by the end of the 19th century.Edison Tech Center The history of electrification: The birth of our power grid. By the mid-1920s electric utilities had succeeded in bringing electricity to virtually all major cities and towns in North America; however, rural areas remained chronically underserved. In 1930 almost 90 percent of farms in the United States were still without access to electric service.Lewis, J. and Severnini, E. (2014). The Value of Rural Electricity: Evidence from the Rollout of the U.S. Power Grid. http://www.economichistory.ca/pdfs/2014/lewisSevernini.pdf Collins was convinced that the best way to win over new customers, including frugal small business owners and skeptical farmers and rural dwellers, was to give his mostly invisible new commodity a more human face.Reddy Kilowatt Inc. (1963). The Reddy Kilowatt Story According to corporate lore, Collins found his inspiration in a dramatic Alabama lightning storm. As he watched the electric discharges strike the ground, he imagined the dancing limbs of a powerful creature, one that could be harnessed in the service of the public. He turned to a colleague, APC engineer Dan Clinton, to create the first drawings of Reddy Kilowatt, an ‚Äúelectrical servant‚Äù with lightning bolt arms and legs, wearing safety gloves and shoes. He added a friendly face with a light bulb nose and wall outlets for ears. APC copyrighted the character on March 6, 1926. Over the next few years Reddy appeared in print advertising for the company. He made his first three-dimensional appearance at the Alabama Electrical Exposition of 1926. Adolescence Image of Reddy Kilowatt, 1933: U.S. trademark 302,093 The onset of the Great Depression in 1929 would further suppress demand for new electric services and slow progress toward rural electrification.Beal, R.T. (1940). Rural Electrification. US Department of Agriculture. Collins remained convinced that the Reddy Kilowatt character could be a powerful promoter of electric power. A lifelong advocate for capitalism, Collins was alarmed by growing government intervention in the sector and also saw Reddy as an ambassador for investor-owned utility companies (IOUs). In 1933, IOUs banded together to advance their interests, forming the Edison Electric Institute. Collins joined the new organization, travelling the United States to promote the use of electrical energy. APC gave Collins the rights to the character he created. He engaged a young family friend, Dorothea Warren (1914‚Äì1999), to refine Reddy Kilowatt's image. On March 28, 1933 Collins was granted trademark number 302,093 by the U.S. Patent Office. Warren would go on to become a prolific commercial artist and author of children's books.Fox Rice, R. Charles and Dorothea Warren Fox. American Art Archives Under the umbrella of the Reddy Kilowatt Service (RKS), Collins used his interactions with other IOUs to promote what he called the ‚ÄúReddy Kilowatt Program‚Äù. He entered into his first licensing agreement with the Philadelphia Electric Company in January 1934.Oswald, D. (2013). Your Electric Servant. Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation Over the next couple of years, Collins would add several other major utilities including Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power and Light, Duke Power, South Carolina Power Company and Tennessee Electric Power Company. RKS entered into a contract with each licensee. The original 1934 version was amended in 1941, 1953, 1963, 1968, 1971 and 1976. In signing the contract, the licensing IOU promised to always represent Reddy Kilowatt as ‚Äúgenial, likeable, well-mannered [and] even-tempered‚Äù and to abide by ‚Äúgenerally accepted standards of good taste.‚ÄùReddy Communications v. Environmental Action. leagle.com In exchange, the licensee was guaranteed a range of products and services by RKS. The most important of these came to be known as the Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book, a catalogue of Reddy Kilowatt images, applications and stock advertisements that could be used or customized by the utility to promote its electrical services. Using the Proofs Book as a guide, companies could order mat service sheets and layout art to meet their needs. By the time of its final edition in 1998, the book had grown to hundreds of pages, containing thousands of images.Reddy Communications Inc. (1998). Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book. RKS also produced a periodical called the Reddy Bulletin, containing news and promotional ideas for licensees. Collins recognized early that Reddy Kilowatt's appeal was without borders. He first sought and obtained trademark protection for the character in Canada in 1934 and subsequently in Argentina (1937), Great Britain (1938), and Mexico (1938). Over the years, Reddy would be licensed extensively in the Caribbean, South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. Maturity With the impending end of hostilities in the final months of World War II, utility companies began to prepare for a return to a consumer-driven economy, and to respond to 15 years of pent-up demand for new household appliances. Demand for electric power jumped 14 per cent between 1946 and 1947 alone. An important driver was that, even as demand for electrical energy increased, the cost of energy continued to decline. When Reddy was created in the mid-20s, a kilowatt-hour cost 55 cents (in constant 1992 dollars). By 1947 it had fallen to 19 cents, and it would continue to fall over the ensuing two decades.Smithsonian Institution (2002). Powering the past. Ashton Collins saw that Reddy Kilowatt could play an important role in promoting electrical use in a period of post-war prosperity, but recognized a need to refine the character's image. As early as 1943, Collins approached the prominent American animator Walt Disney in a bid to adapt Reddy for film. The studio was heavily involved in producing films for the U.S. military at the time and the project did not proceed.Disney History Institute (January 2010). Disney guest star day with Reddy Kilowatt. Reddy Kilowatt, 1946, as adapted by the Walter Lantz studio Two years later, Collins approached another noted animator, Walter Lantz, with the idea of starring Reddy on the big screen. Lantz, whose characters like Woody Woodpecker and Andy Panda were well known to theatre- goers of the period, agreed, releasing the short film Reddy Made Magic in March 1946. Lantz and Collins shared producing credits on the film, which was directed by Dick Lundy, a former Disney animator. The screenplay, by Ben Hardaway and Milt Schaffer, featured the story of the creation of electricity as told by Reddy Kilowatt. In conjunction with the film version of Reddy Made Magic, Educational Comics produced a companion comic book with a cover price of five cents and the subtitle The amazing true story of electricity. Reddy's movie voice was provided by Walter Tetley, the prolific voiceover actor whose talents were in demand by producers needing a high-pitched, adolescent sound. Tetley's credits included the voice of Sherman, sidekick of Jay Ward‚Äôs canine genius Mr. Peabody. Lantz‚Äôs contribution to the Reddy Kilowatt story is considerable. Prior to 1946, Reddy Kilowatt was usually portrayed as a lanky and sometimes awkward-looking creature. Lantz‚Äôs animators refined Reddy‚Äôs look to make his body shorter and more proportional. Reddy‚Äôs wide-cuffed (and five- fingered) safety gloves were replaced with four-fingered white gloves of the type traditionally worn by Mickey Mouse and other popular cartoon creatures. Most important, the Lantz artists broadened Reddy‚Äôs grin and added whites to his eyes, instantly increasing his range of expression. The Lantz film included a song, sung by Walter Tetley as Reddy. It was later used in advertising and commercial applications by licensees. Called simply ‚ÄúReddy Kilowatt‚Äù, the song was written by jazz artist Del Porter and Oscar-nominated composer Darrell Calker. Its catchy lyric concluded: In 1953 Collins incorporated RKS as Reddy Kilowatt, Inc., (RKI) establishing its head office in New York City. The company continued to provide a range of products and services to licensees. In addition to the Proofs Book, RKI produced a handbook with guidelines to assist utilities in using Reddy to their advantage. The Reddy Bulletin was replaced around 1942 by Reddy News, a glossy periodical that highlighted successes and best practices of RKI licensees. RKI continued to aggressively promote its Reddy Kilowatt trademarks worldwide. By 1957, 222 utility companies around the world had licensed use of the character.Reddy Kilowatt, Inc., Appellant, v. Mid-Carolina Electric Cooperative, Inc., and National Ruralelectric Cooperative Association, Inc., Appellees, Decided January 7, 1957 By the end of the 60s, it's estimated that the number of RKI licensees totalled about 300 worldwide.Schirtzinger, Warren (July 15, 2010). Solar‚Äôs main competition. Renewable Energy World Throughout this period, RKI was a prolific producer of promotional materials and incentives, broadly distributed by licensees. Trinkets ranging from men's and women's jewellery, writing instruments and lighters, to oven mitts, aprons and playing cards, featured Reddy Kilowatt's consistently smiling face. Collins‚Äô prime objective remained unchanged: to provide a human, accessible face to the business of energy generation. The theme is evident in RKI art from the time: a winded Reddy running uphill to demonstrate the stress of rising costs; Reddy in hunting togs warning shooters away from power lines; a smiling Reddy framing a power bill as his ‚Äúwages‚Äù.Reddy Communications Inc. (1998). Reddy Kilowatt Art Service Reproduction Proofs Book Reddy Kilowatt explains an electricity bill, c. 1959 RKI continued to advance Collins' pro-free enterprise philosophy. The company encouraged licensees to spread this message to young people. Beginning in the late 1940s, utilities began to sponsor ‚ÄúReddy Kilowatt Youth Clubs‚Äù, incorporating educational activities with capitalist values. At the same time, RKI distributed stock advertisements with conservative political messages for use by licensees. Among the promotions for electric heat and appliances were images of a visibly sweating Reddy warning that government ownership of utilities is ‚ÄúSocialism ‚Äì the twin brother of Communism ‚Äì and we don‚Äôt want either of those isms!‚Äù RKI took steps to vigorously protect its intellectual property. In 1956, RKI sued the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, an association of cooperative-owned utilities, for trademark infringement. Four years earlier, the organization had introduced Willie Wiredhand, a character with a body of electric cable and electric plug feet. On January 7, 1957 the court ruled the characters were different and dismissed the complaint. In 1958, John Sutherland Productions updated Reddy Made Magic for the atomic age, producing the short film The Mighty Atom. The film incorporated some footage from Reddy Made Magic. As before, the film's release was followed by a companion comic book. The film updated the Reddy Kilowatt theme song to declare, \\"I'm in your T-V set with every show you get!\\"The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia.

RKI employed about 30 people at its peak.Knight News Service (February 25, 1978). Reddy Kilowatt changes his image. Decline By the time of Reddy's 50th birthday, the corporate climate for electric utilities had changed considerably. The growing influence of the environmental movement in the late '60s, coupled with the fuel shortages of the early '70s, had directed the utilities‚Äô focus away from expansion and toward conservation. RKI began to advise its licensees on environmental issues, urging them to use the character to advance a message of \\"environmental improvement.\\"Bender, L.M. (June 1972). Letter to IEEE Spectrum magazine. Reddy Kilowatt clip art began to depict the character in various ‚Äúgreen‚Äù poses: planting seedlings and installing energy-efficient lighting, for example. In the late '90s Reddy hung up his pointed-toed safety boots, replacing them with track shoes. In 1976, in an effort to broaden its range of marketable services, RKI would rebrand itself as Reddy Communications, Inc. [RCI], moving its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut. \\"Reddy,\\" insisted Louise Bender in 1978, \\"is the friend of the consumer,\\" adding that urging users to keep their power consumption down was just fulfilling his mission; however, the character's updated image was not an easy fit. Reddy Kilowatt had acted as a cheerleader for energy consumption for more than half a century and his transformation to environmentalist was viewed skeptically by many. Conservation groups and editorial cartoonists began to appropriate the character in ironic and negative ways to satirize the energy industry, to the irritation of the company. In a 1979 case, RCI sued the Environmental Action Foundation (EAF) for its use of Reddy's image to criticize the industry in its publications. The court sided with the EAF and concluded that their parody of the character was fair use. Reddy's decline was hastened further by skyrocketing energy prices in the late 20th century. The changing corporate environment led to mergers, consolidations and government takeovers of energy companies, running afoul of the company's decree that only investor-owned utilities could license the use of Reddy's image. In one example, the Province of Nova Scotia moved to acquire Nova Scotia Light and Power, a Reddy Kilowatt licensee since 1948. Immediately after the sale concluded in January 1972, company officials fanned out across the system to excise the character's image from signs, vehicles and structures. The corporate logo, which formerly featured a beaming Reddy Kilowatt gripping a placard with the company name, was reduced to an unadorned triangle, sometimes with Reddy's amputated fingers remaining as evidence of his passing.Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited, Annual Report, 1972. A final nail in Reddy's coffin was the general fall from grace of fictional and animated characters as corporate spokespersons. Modern corporations have tended to favour abstract logos and wordmarks and celebrity endorsers to represent their brands.Virgin, Bill (July 12, 2006). Why Reddy is no longer current.

The trade in Reddy Kilowatt collectibles and memorabilia, from signs to trinkets, remains popular in antique marketplaces and online auction sites. Because of the volume of such material produced by RKI and its licensees, prices for most items are modest, although some rare and unique pieces can command large amounts.

It was founded by Jack Tramiel on May 17, 1984 as Tramel Technology, Ltd., but then took on the Atari name less than two months later when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console assets of Atari, Inc. to Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, Atari XE, Atari 7800, Atari Lynx and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division which itself closed after JTS sold all Atari assets to Hasbro Interactive in 1998. History The company was founded by Commodore International's founder Jack Tramiel soon after his resignation from Commodore in January 1984. Initially named Tramel Technology, Ltd., the company's goal was to design and sell a next-generation home computer. On July 1, 1984, TTL bought the Consumer Division assets of Atari, Inc. from Warner, and TTL was renamed Atari Corporation. Warner sold the division for $240 million in stocks under the new company. In order to halt the massive losses Atari, Inc. had been yielding under Warner's ownership, Tramiel shut down nearly all of their 80 domestic branches, laying off the staff and liquidating the inventory. Under Tramiel's ownership, Atari used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished the development of their 16-bit computer system, the Atari ST. In 1985, they released their update to the 8-bit computer line‚Äîthe Atari XE series‚Äîas well as the 16-bit Atari ST line. Then in 1986, Atari Corp. launched two consoles designed when Atari was under Warner's control: Atari 2600 Jr and Atari 7800 (which had a limited release in 1984). Atari Corp. rebounded, producing a $25 million profit for 1986. The Atari ST line proved very successful (mostly in Europe, not the U.S.), ultimately selling more than 5 million units. Its built-in MIDI ports made it especially popular among musicians. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the Commodore Amiga, outsold it 3 to 2. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive IBM PC compatibles as well as an MS-DOS compatible palm computer called the Atari Portfolio. Atari, under Tramiel, had a poor reputation in the marketplace. In 1986 a columnist for Atari magazine ANALOG Computing warned that company executives seemed to emulate Tramiel's penny-pinching' [and] hard-nosed bargaining, sometimes at the risk of everything else,\\" resulting in poor customer service and documentation, and product release dates that were \\"perhaps not the entire truth ... Pretty soon, you don't believe anything they say.\\" He concluded, \\"I think Atari Corp. had better start considering how they're perceived by the non-Atari-using public.\\" The company, however, was much more open to the press than its predecessor Atari Inc., which had refused to let Antic preview forthcoming announcements and even opposed the magazine printing the word \\"Atari\\" on its issues. On August 23, 1987, Atari agreed to purchase the Federated Group for $67.3 million. October 4, 1987, Atari completed the acquisition and gained full control of its own retail stores. In the final quarter of 1987, Federated lost $6.4 million in day-to-day operations. A post- acquisition audit ended on February 15, 1988, and identified $43 million in adjustments to Federated's balance sheet, far more than Atari anticipated. The net worth of its acquisition was reduced by $33 million. Atari's CFO later claimed that they would never have done the deal had they known at the time. Federated's operational losses increased, reaching $67 million for its first full year under Atari in 1988. The FBI began an investigation of Atari in May of that same year for an ongoing scheme involving the profitable import and resale of Japanese DRAM chips in the US, \\"in violation of U.S. import laws and contrary to import agreements.\\" In March 1989, Atari announced that it would treat Federated as a discontinued operation and took an additional one-time charge of $57 million. Federated was eventually sold to Silo in 1989. In 1988, Stewart Alsop II said that Atari was among several companies that \\"have already been knocked out\\" of the GUI market by Apple, IBM/Microsoft, and others, but Atari's sales hit their peak that year, at $452 million. In 1989, Atari released the Lynx, a handheld console with color graphics, to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season; the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's Game Boy, which had only a monochrome display, but a much better battery life, and was widely available. As the fortunes of Atari's computers faded, video games again became the company's main focus. In 1993, Atari released its last console, the Jaguar. One of the first entries in the fifth generation of game consoles, the Jaguar was marketed as the world's first 64-bit console. However, due to a games library which was low in both quantity and quality, as well as being extremely difficult to program games for the system because of its multi-chip architecture, it was unable to compete effectively against the incumbent fourth generation consoles; the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation would outsell the Jaguar in very large numbers late in its lifespan. Atari sustained a net loss of $49.6 million for 1995, with $27.7 million in losses during the last quarter of the year alone. Attempting to hedge their bets, in January 1996, Atari announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Atari Interactive, which would be devoted to publishing games for PC. However, Atari would soon relinquish all of its interest in both the Jaguar and PC software. = Demise and Aftermath = In December 1995, Sam Tramiel suffered a mild heart attack, forcing him to step down as Atari's president; this caused Jack Tramiel to come back and lead the company again. However, by early 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank but, due to the Jaguar's commercial failure, no new products to sell at all. In addition, the Tramiel family wanted themselves out of business, resulting in a rapid succession of changes in management. On February 13, 1996, Atari agreed to merge with JTS Inc., a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, in a reverse takeover to form JTS Corporation; the reverse merger was completed on July 30, 1996. Atari's role in the new company largely became a holder for the Atari properties; most Atari staff were either dismissed or resigned, with the remainder relocated to JTS's headquarters. Consequently, the Atari name all but vanished from the consumer market as a result. On March 13, 1998, JTS Corporation sold the Atari name and assets to HIAC XI, Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive, for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. The transaction primarily involved the brand and intellectual property rights which would then fall under Hasbro's Atari Interactive division; the rights to the Jaguar, however, were released into the public domain on May 14, 1999. On January 29, 2001, Hasbro Interactive, along with Atari Interactive, was purchased by Infogrames Entertainment SA, renaming itself Infogrames Interactive and then took on its current name in 2003 after its merger with the Hasbro-established Atari Interactive; the present day Atari Interactive, through Atari SA, continues to hold and license all Atari trademarks as well as producing many new games, some based on Atari's original properties, to this day.

Bimonthly it publishes the Kaskaskia Baptist Visitor, a newsletter with a circulation of about 1,000 that reports on mission projects and church news from throughout the association.  History  The Kaskaskia Baptist Association has a unique history. It was formed as the Vandalia Baptist Association in 1840 by three converging movements: The Friends of Humanity, which was the group of Anti-slavery Baptists led by the Lemen family, the Sunday School Movement, and the Missions Movement, both of which were led by John Mason Peck, who was sent by the Northern (American) Baptists from the East. The Vandalia Baptist Association was the fifth association formed by the Friends of Humanity. Many of the churches within the present Kaskaskia Baptist Association, which predate the association, seemed to have simultaneously been formed by the Sunday School Movement and the anti- slavery movement. Neither of these movements, however, worked together at the time. Many of the founding churches still exist today. The association has never disbanded, but rather has had three different names which were changed in order to accommodate the changes of boundaries as new areas joined. The name changed from Vandalia Baptist Association to Centralia Baptist Association to assimilate churches in Mt. Vernon and Centralia in 1880. The name of the association again changed in 1912 to the Kaskaskia Baptist Association when churches left the Northern (American) Baptist denomination to become Southern Baptist. In the year 2007, records from the association from 1845 to 1910 will be available on the Kaskaskia Baptist Association website. Eventually all historical records will be available on the website. Also at the website there is a complete history online of the churches as well as a timeline history of the association.

It is the eponymous member of the enigmatic phylum Vetulicolia, which is of uncertain affinities but may belong to the deuterostomes. Description The type species, Vetulicola cuneata (Hou, 1987) has a body composed of two distinct parts of approximately equal length. The anterior part is rectangular with a carapace-like structure of four rigid cuticular plates, with a large mouth at the front end. The posterior section is slender, strongly cuticularised and placed dorsally. Paired openings connecting the pharynx to the outside run down the sides. These features are interpreted as possible primitive gill slits. Vetulicola cuneata could be up to 9 cm long. The Vetulicola are thought to have been swimmers that were either filter feeders or detritivores. Other Vetulicola species described are Vetulicola rectangulata (Luo & Hou, 1999), V. gantoucunensis (Luo et al., 2005), V. monile (Aldridge, Hou, Siveter, Siberet and Gabbott, 2007), and V. longbaoshanensis. The mouth openings of all the other species are smaller, and do not protrude as in V. cuneata. All other species, with the stark exception of V. gantoucunensis, are smaller than the type species. Taxonomy Vetulicola's taxonomic position is controversial. Vetulicola cuneata was originally assigned to the crustaceans on the assumption that it was a bivalved arthropod like Canadaspis and Waptia, but the lack of legs, the presence of gill slits, and the four plates in the \\"carapace\\" were unlike any known arthropod. Shu et al. placed Vetulicola in the new family Vetulicolidae, order Vetulicolida and phylum Vetulicolia, among the deuterostomes. Shu (2003) later argued that the vetulicolians were an early, specialized side-branch of deuterostomes. Dominguez and Jefferies classify Vetulicola as an urochordate, and probably a stem-group appendicularian. In contrast, Butterfield places Vetulicola among the arthropods. The discovery of the related Australian vetulicolian Nesonektris, from the Lower Cambrian Emu Bay Shale of Kangaroo Island, and the reidentification of the \\"coiled gut\\" of vetulicolians as being a notochord affirms the identification as an urochordate. Etymology Vetulicola is a compound Latin word composed of vetuli, meaning \\"old,\\" or \\"ancient,\\" and cola, meaning \\"inhabitant.\\"\\"Vetulicolians - are they deuterostomes? chordates?\\" References  *Butterfield, Nicholas J. 2003.

The band's style has been categorized as \\"death country\\", \\"frontier rock\\", or \\"revival music\\". History Members Mark Sasso and Casey Laforet grew up together in Windsor, and began playing as a band after moving to Toronto following high school. They played their first show in 2002 with two other musicians at Toronto club Holy Joes. Although the two other musicians dropped out of the band's lineup after only a few shows, Sasso and Laforet continued as a duo, hooking up with producer Stephen Pitkin to record their first EP, Tin Type. Tin Type was recorded over two days in Mark Sasso's living room. The band called the recording space \\"The Orange Room\\" because it was painted orange. The EP was released in January 2004 by weewerk Records, and came packaged in a brown paper bag containing a handmade photobook done in the style of the American Old West. Pitkin recorded and co-produced Tin Type, but did not officially become a band member until the band released its first LP, Ambassador, on Six Shooter Records in 2005. Much of Ambassador was recorded by Joe Dunphy in a former abattoir in the Toronto Public Stock Yards, which had been converted to a recording studio called \\"Monumental Sound\\". The album was named for the Ambassador Bridge which connects Windsor with Detroit. The band released its second full-length album, Mountain Meadows, in 2008. Mountain Meadows was coproduced with John Critchley at Green Door Studio in Toronto, where the album was also mixed. In keeping with the band's fondness for incorporating unique room tones within the recording, a number of locations across Canada were selected, including Healey Lake Lodge in MacTier, Wayne Town Hall in Wayne, Mount Robson Lodge in Valemount, and Halla Music in Toronto, as well as Casey Laforet's kitchen and Mark's garage. The album was shortlisted for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize. Until June 2008, Pitkin's contribution to Elliott Brood was embellished by his use of a Samsonite \\"Silhouette\\" suitcase instead of a conventional bass drum. After pummeling through several cases at inopportune times, he decided to put the idea to rest. This came after a particularly destructive encore on a double bill with United Steel Workers of Montreal at Le Divan Orange club in Montreal. The destroyed case from that show now resides as an art installation on the wall of the Moho Tavern in Peterborough.Correspondence with Stephen Pitkin In 2010, the band wrote the score for Adriana Maggs' film Grown Up Movie Star. Their song \\"West End Sky\\" garnered a Genie Award nomination for Achievement in Music: Original Song. Paper Bag Records became the band's new record label in June 2011, and released their new album Days Into Years on September 27. Much of the album's content was inspired by a visit to the √âtaples Military Cemetery during a tour through France. Days Into Years spent eight consecutive weeks in the top 10 on the National Campus and Community Radio Association's !earshot radio charts, peaking at No. 1 in the folk/roots/blues category, and at No. 5 overall. After a number of years in Toronto, two members of the band are now based in Hamilton. Tours Elliott Brood has toured extensively throughout Canada as well as internationally. They have opened for acts including Wilco, War On Drugs, The Head and the Heart, Blue Rodeo, The Black Crowes, Corb Lund, Do Make Say Think, and The Sadies and They also headlined the first \\"Wood, Wires, and Whisky\\" tour across Canada in fall 2007, with The Acorn, Sunparlour Players, and Plants and Animals. Elliott Brood has also played at major music festivals such as BBK Festival Bilbao Spain (2014), The Sasquatch Festival (2013), Pickathon in Portland, Oregon (2011/2009), the Olympic Village in Whistler for the 2010 Winter Olympics in British Columbia and North Country Fair in 2004 in Driftpile, Alberta.

Along with Benoit Le Coffre set the tone for history painting in Denmark during the 18th century-1720s, having been influenced by the Italian baroque painting he experienced during his travels. He also played a role in the eventual establishment of an Art Academy in Denmark.  Early training  He was born to merchant Valentin Krock and Volborg Peters in Flensborg. At 11 years of age he studied under Johan Ayersch√∂ttel of Husum, a well-known portraitist of the time. He came to Copenhagen in 1688, where he taught drawing, and studied under painter to the royal court Peder Andersen at Frederiksborg Palace. In 1693 he traveled to France, and then to Italy, where he stayed for a period of time. According to one of his later students, Krock traveled to Italy in the company of young Ulrik Christian Gyldenl√∏ve, King Frederick IV‚Äôs half-brother. He returned to Italy in 1699.  Impetus to an Art Academy  In October 1701 Krock was in Copenhagen again, and on 6 October 1701 he was one of the cosigners of a petition sent to King Frederick IV requesting approval for the formation of an artist society and teaching academy. This was the humble beginning to the formation of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) many years later. The other cosigners were Wilchen Riboldt, Jacob Coning, Otto de Willarts, Georg Saleman and Thomas Quellinus, all court artists. He traveled to Italy for the third time in 1703, and worked several years in the studio of Carlo Maratta, under a travel grant from the King. He may have studied at the Art Academy in Paris ca. 1705.  Painter to the court  He returned to Denmark again in 1705, and painted over the remainder of his working life many plafonds, wall panels, door pieces and mythological paintings as decoration for such royal palaces and castles as Frederiksberg, Fredensborg, Hirschholm, Rosenborg, and Christiansborg, as well as for various churches. These works were generally large, and with many figures. He was named royal painter in 1706. He married Helle Cathrine Robring in 1707. Numerous works were lost to the fires at Christiansborg in 1794 and at Frederiksborg in 1859, including his famous \\"Dommedag\\" (\\"Judgement Day\\"). Work extant can still be seen on plafonds at Fredensborg and Frederiksberg. Due to the volume of work he produced he maintained a studio with many students and apprentices. He made only a few portraits, and when depicting royalty or nobility he was known to be assisted by Nicolai Wichmann to complete the heads and faces. The artist society met weekly until 1712 in the Ahlefeldt house on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen, where Krock taught drawing. That same year Krock received a royal studio behind B√∏rsen (‚ÄúThe Stock Exchange‚Äù) in the Post Office (Postamts) building. Beside his duties as a royal painter, he used the studio to teach drawing, and also as a meeting place for the artist society which he managed and provided with educational materials. Krock became a well-to-do man, and had an impressive home. His first wife died in 1718. In 1722 he became an advisor to the Chancellory (Kancelliraad). He remarried on 17 November 1722 to Elisabeth Vilhelmine Magdalene Cumm, but she died a year later. He married his third wife, Armgott Sophie Koefoed, on 26 April 1724. His position as royal painter was renewed in 1731; at that same time, however when the building of Christiansborg had begun, the preferred artistic style was quickly changing from Krock‚Äôs baroque to the new rococo-style. French painters were being called in to do the work, because there were no qualified Danish artists. And therefore, the idea of a Danish Art Academy, which could train native artists to decorate the King‚Äôs castles and palaces, became an important royal objective. In 1731 he painted an altar piece portraying Christ on the Mount of Olives in St. Peter‚Äôs Church (Sankt Petri Kirke) in Copenhagen. The work was thoroughly restored in 1995. His third wife died in 1733. In the late 1730s plans were beginning to seriously take shape for a royal art academy, and the Academy received rooms in the same building as Krock's studio. In 1738 Krock was named leader of Christian VI‚Äôs Art Academy along with sculptor Louis August le Clerc. Krock, however, died shortly afterwards on 18 November 1738. Leadership of the burgeoning Academy was taken over by le Clerc and Venetian history painter Hieronimo Miani after Krock's death. None of his students or apprentices took over his artistic production. There is a portrait of Krock by Johann Salomon Wahl in the collection of the Frederiksborg Castle Museum.

The site that was operational in the early 20th century is now partly surrounded by Wollemi National Park.Wollemi National Park, Central Mapping Authority of New South Wales, First Edition The settlement was originally built by the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. History and description More ruins at the original Newnes Industrial Section A major oil shale mine with two headings was started on the north side of the Wolgan River, opposite the works. It was intended to tunnel through the mountain to meet up with some earlier workings in the Capertee Valley as mining conditions in the Capertee were regarded as being much better than in the Wolgan. However, mining difficulties and the generally low quality of the shale in this area meant that mining became concentrated on the No. 2 mine and work on the No. 1 mine was eventually abandoned. Although construction of a tunnel linking the Wolgan Valley with the Capertee was proposed on numerous subsequent occasions, it was to remain an elusive dream. The No. 2 mine was established on the southern side of the river, east of the works. This mine was to provide most of the oil shale for the working life of Newnes. The main works site was established in a sweeping bend on the south bank of the Wolgan River and extending up the adjacent talus hillside. These works consisted of retorts, various distillation areas, oil storage tanks and washers, plant for the refining of the various finished products, a power station, workshops, etc., with provision for future expansion. They were built in a substantial manner, as attested by the extensive ruins that stand to this day. Although construction commenced in 1906, it was not until 1911 that the initial stage was completed and the retorts charged for the first time. A village was established close to the mining leases. Originally known as Wolgan, it was renamed Newnes‚Äîafter Sir George Newnes, the chairman of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation at the time‚Äîin early 1907. In its early years, Newnes was also known as South Newnes to distinguish it from the small settlement of North Newnes, in the Capertee Valley, from where a tunnel was being driven toward the Wolgan Valley operations until September 1906. Over the years its prosperity reflected that of the mining operations so that in 1906 Newnes had a population of about 100, increasing to 800 by 1907, fell to 96 in 1914, grew to 200 by 1924 but then fell again to only 4 families in 1940. At the , Newnes had a population of 4. The company built the Newnes railway line from the main government railway south of Newnes to their works through very difficult country, particularly where the line descended into the Wolgan Valley from the plateau above. This railway is no longer in use and the rails have been removed. A tunnel on the railway has survived as the Glowworm Tunnel, which has become something of a tourist attraction. The Newnes Hotel functioned successfully for some time, although business was affected when mining operations were shifted to Glen Davis, further north in the Capertee Valley. However, the hotel was flood-prone because of its proximity to the Wolgan River. In 1986, flooding undermined the building's structure, as a result of which it was physically moved by volunteers in 1987. The licence was sold in 1988.Newnes History Site Camping Camping is available on both sides of the Wolgan River; only pit toilets are provided. Most of the camping is in the National Park, at no charge, so pets are not permitted. Wood should not be collected for wood fires. As of 2015 there was wood available from the Newnes Hotel. There is a very small amount of private land remaining in Newnes, where camping is available for a fee and pets are permitted. Information available from the former Newnes Hotel, which is open as a kiosk on most weekends.http://www.newnescampground.com Walks and hikes There are several walks in the Newnes area, apart from walking through the ruins. Walks include: * Pipeline Pass - This is a medium to hard walk that goes from Newnes to the oil shale operations at Glen Davis. The walk takes around 10 hours and is normally completed as an overnight walk.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.308 There are lyrebirds, cycads, Banksia and assorted Eucalyptus trees. As of 2015 the pass is now closed due to private property disputes near Newnes. * Wolgan River to Rocky Creek. This route follows the Wolgan River downstream to Rocky Creek. The route is hard to find in many places, but the walking grade is fairly moderate and most people can complete it in a full day return. * Wolgan River to Annie Rowan Creek. Two day (overnight at Annie Rowan Creek) or three day (two nights at junction of Rocky Creek and Deanes Creek) return. Note that the track beyond Rocky Creek is mostly on the north side of the Wolgan River. Wildlife A variety of native wildlife can be observed in the vicinity of the Newnes campground.

He purchased Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy in order to establish a bird sanctuary, and later donated the island to Bowdoin College for use as a research station. Family and education John Sterling Rockefeller was a member of the wealthy Rockefeller family. He was the grandson of William Avery Rockefeller and the grand-nephew of John D. Rockefeller. He was the fourth of five children of William Goodsell Rockefeller. His maternal grandfather was the investor and banker James Stillman. Rockefeller attended the Taft School and Yale University, where he was a member of the Scroll and Key Society. He graduated from Yale in 1928. Contributions to ornithology and conservation =Collecting in Africa= In July 1928 Rockefeller, his Yale classmate Charles B. G. Murphy, and the Canadian collector and taxidermist Allan Moses went to Africa on an ornithological expedition to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. The survey was funded by a grant of approximately $150,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation. The main goal of the expedition was to find and collect the rare Grauer's broadbill, which was known only by one 1908 specimen in the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in England, and which had eluded collectors for twenty years. On July 26, 1929, in a mountainous area at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, Moses was the first to find and shoot a Grauer's broadbill. The party collected several more broadbill specimens and spent a further three months collecting before returning to the United States. =Purchase and donation of Kent Island= In order to thank him for his work on the expedition and for collecting the first Grauer's broadbill, Rockefeller undertook to purchase three small islands near Allan Moses's home on Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy and make them a bird sanctuary. The common eider population had been declining for several years and there were estimated to be at most 30 breeding pairs from the Gulf of Maine southward along the Atlantic Coast. Most of these nested on Kent Island, one of the three islands in question. The owner of Kent Island, the largest of the three, sold it for $25,000, but the owner of the two smaller islands refused to sell them. Rockefeller hired two resident wardens for Kent Island, one of whom was Moses himself. They moved to the island in June 1930 and over the following years the eider population increased dramatically, reaching several hundred nesting pairs by 1935. In 1936, after visits to Kent Island by scientists including Ernst Mayr and Alfred O. Gross of Bowdoin College, Rockefeller donated the island to Bowdoin College as a research station in exchange for the nominal fee of one dollar ($1.00) and the college's commitment to maintain it as a bird sanctuary. =Expedition sponsorship= Rockefeller funded a 1932 ornithological expedition to Timor and Sumba under the direction of Erwin Stresemann. Ernst Mayr later studied the resulting collection. =Eponymous recognition= Rockefeller is commemorated in the names of two birds. Turdus poliocephalus sterlingi (Sterling's thrush) is a subspecies of island thrush which was described by Ernst Mayr in 1944. Cinnyris rockefelleri (Rockefeller's sunbird) is found in Central Africa. It was described by James Chapin in his 1932 work The Birds of the Belgian Congo, Part I. Business and personal life In 1931 Rockefeller married Paula Watjen. Her father was the central European representative of the Guaranty Trust Company, a New York bank. At the time of his marriage Rockefeller was \\"associated with\\" the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company of New York. In 1948 he joined with other Rockefeller and Thomas Fortune Ryan heirs in forming the Enterprise Development Corporation to invest in \\"securities of privately owned companies making mechanical end-products\\".

It works in conjunction with gastric chief cells and parietal cells. G cells are found deep within the pyloric glands of the stomach antrum, and occasionally in the pancreas and duodenum. The vagus nerve innervates the G cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide is released by the post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve onto G cells during parasympathetic stimulation. The peptide hormone bombesin also stimulates gastrin from G cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide, as well as the presence of amino acids in the stomach, stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells. Gastrin stimulates enterochromaffin-like cells to secrete histamine.

He was an outfielder on the school's varsity team before making the transition to pitcher. He attended Tuskegee University, but transferred to Polk Community College after one year when the former dropped baseball scholarships.Brown, Rick. \\"Former Baseball Pro Tries to Lift Kathleen High's Game,\\" The Ledger (Lakeland, FL), Monday, December 27, 2010. He was selected in the MLB Draft on two occasions in 1986, both times in phases that were discontinued later that year.Draft Report: 1980s - Major League Baseball. He was chosen by the Boston Red Sox (13th overall) and California Angels (8th overall) in the first rounds of the regular phase of the January draft and the secondary phase of the June draft respectively.Alan Mills (statistics & history) - Baseball-Reference.com. He decided to sign with the Angels over the Red Sox based on which team was willing to finance his final two years of college. Mills spent just one season with the Salem Angels of the Northwest League, compiling a 6-6 record over fourteen starts, before the Angels sent him to the New York Yankees to complete a December 19, 1986, deal in which the Yankees sent Butch Wynegar to the Angels for Ron Romanick and a player to be named later. New York Yankees Mills converted to a relief pitcher during his three seasons in the Yankees' farm system, going 12‚Äì24 with a 4.25 ERA and thirteen saves. With the Prince William Cannons of the Class A Carolina League in , Mills went 6‚Äì1 with a 0.91 ERA and seven saves to lead his team to their first Carolina League title. Though he had never pitched above A ball, his performance earned him and invitation to Spring training in . He made his major league debut on April 14, pitching 2.2 scoreless innings against the Texas Rangers. Mills went 1‚Äì5 with a 4.15 ERA his rookie year splitting his time between the Yankees and triple A Columbus Clippers. For Columbus, he was 3‚Äì3 with a 3.38 ERA and six saves. Mills spent most of in the minors, however, made two starts upon returning to the club in September. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named later during Spring training the following season. As of 2012, Mills is the only Yankee to wear number 69 in a regular season game. Baltimore Orioles Mills emerged as a valuable member of the Orioles' bullpen upon his arrival in Baltimore. He went 10‚Äì4 with a 2.61 ERA over 103.1 innings in . Mills made a team high 72 appearances in , going 3‚Äì4 with a 3.74 ERA. Perhaps the most famous moment of Mills' career came on May 19, , when he gave Darryl Strawberry a right cross that bloodied his face in the dugout during a bench clearing brawl with the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Strawberry had just hit Mills' teammate Armando Ben√≠tez with a cheap shot during a melee, and Mills promptly defended Benitez by clocking Strawberry point-blank. The following season, Mills signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. After a season and a half in Los Angeles, he was dealt back to the Orioles for Alberto Reyes. He remained with the Orioles through before being released. In a 12-season career, Mills posted a 39‚Äì32 record with 456 strikeouts and a 4.12 ERA in 474 games. Mills wore jersey number 75 with the Orioles. Numbers that high are typically only worn by players in spring training (when teams have considerably larger rosters than they do during the regular season). Mills chose to wear it as a motivating factor, to remind himself that his job was not necessarily any more secure than that of someone in spring training should he perform poorly.https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/uniform-numbers-69-nationals- aj-cole-bronson-arroyo-alan-mills-jordy-mercer-eric-fryer-peter- munro/w4hww96ogi821es8gugiguijo Erie SeaWolves Mills attempted comebacks with the Montreal Expos in Spring training and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in , but was essentially away from the game for five years before signing a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers in , and spending one season with the Erie SeaWolves. In his first 27 games, he went 23-for-23 in save opportunities, posting a 1.65 ERA and limiting batters to a .154 batting average. Post- retirement Mills returned to his alma mater Kathleen High School as a physical education teacher and head coach of its varsity baseball team from 2009 through 2011. It was also during that time that he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Ashford University in 2009. He has also served as a pitching coach in the New York-Penn League for the Oneonta Tigers in 2008.

However, the strict definition is the probability that a pair of individuals will both have a certain characteristic, given that one of the pair has the characteristic. For example, twins are concordant when both have or both lack a given trait. The ideal example of concordance is that of identical twins. Discordance, in genetics typically means that a similar trait is not shared between twin members. Studies of twins have shown that genetic traits of monozygotic twins are fully concordant whereas in dizygotic twins, half of genetic traits are concordant, while the other half are discordant. Discordant rates that are higher than concordant rates express the influence of the environment on twin traits. Studies A twin study compares the concordance rate of identical twins to that of fraternal twins. This can help suggest whether a disease or a certain trait has a genetic cause. Controversial uses of twin data have looked at concordance rates for homosexuality and intelligence. Other studies have involved looking at the genetic and environmental factors that can lead to increased LDL in women twins. Because identical twins are genetically virtually identical, it follows that a genetic pattern carried by one would very likely also be carried by the other. If a characteristic identified in one twin is caused by a certain gene, then it would also very likely be present in the other twin. Thus, the concordance rate of a given characteristic helps suggest whether or to what extent a characteristic is related to genetics. There are several problems with this assumption: #A given genetic pattern may not have 100% penetrance, in which case it may have different phenotypic consequences in genetically identical individuals; #Developmental and environmental conditions may be different for genetically identical individuals. If developmental and environmental conditions contribute to the development of the disease or other characteristic, there can be differences in the outcome of genetically identical individuals; #The logic is further complicated if the characteristic is polygenic, i.e., caused by differences in more than one gene. #Epigenetic effects can alter the genetic expressions in twins through varied factors. The expression of the epigenetic effect is typically weakest when the twins are young and increases as the identical twins grow older. #Where in the absence of one or more environmental factors a condition will not develop in an individual, even with high concordance rates, the proximate cause is environmental, with strong genetic influence: thus \\"a substantial role of genetic factors does not preclude the possibility that the development of the disease can be modified by environmental intervention.\\" So \\"genetic factors are assumed to contribute to the development of that disease\\", but cannot be assumed alone to be causal. Genotyping studies  In genotyping studies where DNA is directly assayed for positions of variance (see SNP), concordance is a measure of the percentage of SNPs that are measured as identical. Samples from the same individual or identical twins theoretically have a concordance of 100%, but due to assaying errors and somatic mutations, they are usually found in the range of 99% to 99.95%. Concordance can therefore be used as a method of assessing the accuracy of a genotyping assay platform. Because a child inherits half of his or her DNA from each parent, parents and children, siblings, and fraternal (dizygotic) twins have a concordance that averages 50% using this measure.

The second African American to hold the New Orleans mayoral chair, he was a member of the Louisiana State Senate from 1974 to 1978 and a member at- large of the New Orleans City Council from 1978 to 1986. He served as mayor of New Orleans from 1986 to 1994. He is a member of the Democratic Party.  Early life and career  Barthelemy was born on March 17, 1942 in New Orleans, LA Sidney 2011, p. 1 and was the third of six children in a Creole family. He grew up in the Seventh Ward, and attended Corpus Christi Elementary School and St. Augustine High School (New Orleans).Sidney 2011, p. 1 From 1960 to 1963, in preparation for entering the priesthood, he studied at Epiphany Apostolic Junior College in Newburgh, New York, and then entered St. Joseph Seminary in Washington, D.C., where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy and pursued graduate study in Theology. While in seminary, he worked summers as a laborer in a stevedoring company. In 1967, having made the decision not to enter the priesthood,Perkins 2005, p.6 Barthelemy returned to New Orleans and became an administrative assistant in the office of Total Community Action. In 1968, Barthelemy married Michaele Thibideau.Sidney 2011, p. 1 From 1969 to 1972 he was director of the Parent Child Center of Family Health, Inc. During these years he also completed a Master of Social Work degree at Tulane University in New Orleans, worked part-time for the Urban League of Greater New Orleans and assisted with various political campaigns, joining COUP, a political organization based in the 7th Ward of New Orleans.Perkins 2005, p.7 From 1972 to 1974 Barthelemy was Director of the Department of Welfare under Mayor Moon Landrieu. Backed by COUP, Barthelemy was elected in 1974 to one term in the Louisiana State Senate from District 4;Perkins 2005, p.6 he was the first African-American to serve in that body since Reconstruction. While he served in the Legislature, he also joined Xavier University as assistant director of the Urbinvolve Program and as an instructor in the Department of Sociology and became an adjunct faculty member in the Applied Health Sciences Department, Maternal and Child Health Section, of Tulane University. In 1978 Barthelemy was elected to an at-large seat on the New Orleans City Council, a position he held for two terms.Perkins 2005, p.9 While in the council, Barthelemy become known for his longstanding rivalry with Mayor Ernest \\"Dutch\\" Morial. In 1979, Barthelemy was elected to the state Senate, defeating a white incumbent who had held the seat for sixteen years.Whelan 1991, p.11 He defeated Bill Jefferson in the 1986 mayoral election to succeed Morial. On May 5, 1986, Barthelemy began his first term as mayor of New Orleans.Perkins 2005, p.18  Election of 1986  Sidney Barthelemy first set his sights on becoming mayor of New Orleans in 1982, when he was reelected to the city council.Perkins 2005, p.9 Barthelemy seemed the complete opposite of his fiery predecessor Ernest Morial, who had something of a \\"will of iron\\".Johnson 1986, p.121 Barthelemy was more relaxed in demeanor. Not allowed to run for a third term as mayor, Morial supported Barthelemy's runoff opponent William J. Jefferson.Johnson 1986, p.124 Eliminated in the primary was former state Representative Sam A. LeBlanc, III, who finished with a strong 25 percent of the vote. The runoff between Barthelemy and Jefferson was the first in which both contenders were African Americans.Johnson 1986, p.124 Many African Americans felt as though Barthelemy was concentrating his focus on white- collar businesses.Johnson 1986, p.121 Barthelemy received 58 percent of the total votes cast but only 43 percent of the black vote. He won 86 percent of the vote cast by the dwindling number of white voters in the city.Perry 1990, p.156 Oddly, in contrast to 1986, Barthelemy won reelection in 1990 with 86 percent of the black vote but only 23 percent of the white vote.Perry 1990, p.157  Barthelemy as mayor  First elected in 1986, Barthelemy became the second African American mayor of New Orleans with 58% of the vote.Huey 1990, p.156 Barthelemy's mayoralty began under difficult circumstances. Federal government revenue sharing to municipalities had been progressively reduced from 1981 onwards, and had ended by the time Barthelemy took office in 1986. Annual funding grants from federal and state sources to New Orleans city government decreased from around $40 million a year to less than $6 million a year between 1984 and 1989.Perkins 2005, p.2 A regional economic slump, the so-called Oil Bust added to these budget woes. Louisiana's energy-dependent economy, already slowing as the price of oil declined from its 1980 high point, was pummeled in early 1986 by a sudden collapse in price per barrel from over $27 to less than $10. With the state's economy in crisis, the unemployment rate in the city climbed to over ten percent Johnson 1986, p.121 and the city government's budget deficit reached $30 million.Whelan 1991, p.12 To solve this, Barthelemy worked with the city council and developed a plan to dig the city out of the deficit. This plan involved cutting costs, raising fees, and privatizing operations, in the course of which over 1,000 city workers lost their jobs.Whelan 1991, p.12 Taking a less hands-on approach to economic development than his predecessor, Barthelemy preferred to let the private sector be the primary engine of growth. This preference in favor of for-profit actors extended to affordable housing issues, highlighted by Barthelemy's proposal to privatize and demolish much of the city's public housing. The plan was received with great skepticism among community activists and ultimately abandoned.Perkins 2005, p.26 Though Barthelemy took a pro- business stance, his unfocused, laissez-faire approach to attacking the city's problems was harmful in the post-Oil Bust period; it was during his and his successor's mayoralties that New Orleans lost much of its remaining attractiveness as a center for corporate white collar employment. As recently as the late 1970s and early 1980s, downtown New Orleans had experienced a building boom, with multiple office towers constructed to house the headquarters, or large regional offices, for companies such as Freeport- McMoRan, Pan American Life Insurance, Exxon, Chevron, Gulf Oil, Amoco, Mobil, Murphy Oil and Texaco. In the mid-80s these firms, along with other large employers such as Royal Dutch Shell, Louisiana Land and Exploration and McDermott International, employed thousands of white collar workers downtown, with thousands more employed by others providing services to them. Out of the above group, only Shell and Pan American Life Insurance remain as significant employers in downtown New Orleans today. Though Barthelemy probably couldn't have averted the consolidation of Big Oil white collar employment to Houston, he was unsuccessful in creating an economic climate sufficiently conducive to the growth of replacement white collar employers downtown, or elsewhere in the city. A big disappointment occurred in 1988, when defense and space contractor Martin Marietta lost its bid to construct the crew modules for NASA's Space Station Freedom. Martin Marietta would have fabricated the space station hardware at its Michoud Assembly Facility in Eastern New Orleans, already the manufacturing location of the Space Shuttle's external tank. The contract, won by Boeing, resulted in thousands of jobs created at that company's chosen assembly site, Huntsville, Alabama. More disappointment followed the creation of the Metrovision regional economic development partnership, as that body largely failed to diversify or attract additional investment to Metro New Orleans' economy. Barthelemy's administration was not without economic development successes, as he managed to bring additional investment to New Orleans East, most notably by attracting the giant Pick 'n Save distribution center to the New Orleans Regional Business Park (then known as the Almonaster-Michoud Industrial District). The Pick 'n Save project embodied the city's renewed efforts to leverage the existing infrastructure of the Port of New Orleans, then experiencing a resurgence under the leadership of Ron Brinson, by attracting modern warehousing and distribution facilities to the city. In the wake of the Oil Bust, however, the Barthelemy administration most forcefully advocated for the continued development of New Orleans' tourist and convention industry. Tourism was the only sector of the city's economy to exhibit meaningful growth under Barthelemy. Several high-profile wins occurred, including attracting the Republican National Convention to the city in 1988 and the NCAA Final Four tournament in 1993. Barthelemy also oversaw the opening of the Aquarium of the Americas, the Riverfront streetcar line, the New Orleans Centre and Riverwalk downtown malls, and encouraged the first expansion of the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center (then known as the New Orleans Convention Center).Perkins 2005, p.45 In administering city government, Barthelemy managed to gradually eliminate the $30 million budget deficit he inherited in 1986, but his methods of raising revenue - attempting to impose an \\"earnings tax\\" on the personal income of suburbanites who worked within the city limits, legalization of a land-based casino and riverboat gambling - were controversial. He staffed agencies such as the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) Perkins 2005, p.17 and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) with members of COUP and other political allies. Other notable narratives of the Barthelemy administration included the visit of Pope John Paul II to New Orleans in 1987, the passage of the controversial \\"anti- discrimination\\" ordinance affecting the membership in Carnival krewes, an unsuccessful, city-sponsored effort to redevelop Louis Armstrong Park into a Tivoli Gardens-style recreation park/amusement center, an unsuccessful proposal to construct a new international airport in New Orleans East, in what later became the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge, the post-World's Fair gentrification and redevelopment of the downtown Warehouse District, and the securing of funding for a new sports arena next to the Superdome. Consistent with the city's increasing economic tilt to tourism and the cultural economy, Barthelemy's mayoralty also supported a large addition to the New Orleans Museum of Art, in which the museum attained its present size, as well as the creation of the Louisiana Children's Museum in the Warehouse District. Plans to re-use portions of the former Canadian Pavilion of the World's Fair, including its IMAX theater, as a new Louisiana Science Museum came to nothing, however. Throughout his political career, Barthelemy carried a reputation as a quiet and mild-tempered politician,Simerman 2012, p.1 in marked contrast to his fiery predecessor Dutch Morial, and to typical New Orleans politicians in general. His critics interpreted this as a sign of passivity and poor leadership. Under his mayoralty, the city's population declined significantly, the crime rate increased dramatically, the murder rate increasing along with the amount of drug use.Perkins 2005, p.30 The performance of the city's public school system continued to erode as well - though in fairness the schools were controlled by the Orleans Parish School Board. National trends were also unfavorable to cities during Barthelemy's mayoralty; New Orleans was far from alone in grappling with economic stagnation and rising crime. Still, many of the alleged deficiencies of the Barthelemy administration were already acknowledged as fact by the public by the end of Barthelemy's first term. His re-election campaign in 1990 was marked by widespread criticism of his administration, and of his perceived lack of leadership - but Barthelemy managed to defeat his challenger Donald Mintz in a runoff election in which Barthelemy received 55% of the vote.Huey, 1990. p. 157 1993 marked a low point in his mayoralty, as that year witnessed the destruction of the old Canal streetcar barn, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and at the time the oldest surviving streetcar barn in the country.See court case \\"Weber V. Pena, 1993\\" case #93-0712 US District Court for the District of Columbia Later that year, Barthelemy was responsible for bringing a little-known statewide political perk to the attention of voters. At his son's graduation ceremony from Brother Martin High School, it was announced that he would be receiving the \\"Mayor's Academic Scholarship to Tulane University.\\" This drew a mixed reaction from the crowd in attendance. The next day, the story was featured on the local news in New Orleans. By the end of the week, the story was the talk of the state, and it was revealed that in addition to the Mayor, all members of the Louisiana Legislature could grant scholarships to Tulane University. Louisiana legislators were permitted to award the scholarships to anyone they saw fit, provided that the nominee was a bona fide citizen and resident of the district or parish and \\"shall comply with the requirements for admission established\\"Act 43, Louisiana Constitution of 1884 by the university's board. Through further investigation, it was revealed that politicians regularly gave these scholarships to their own family members and to the children of political allies. In some instances, the scholarships were given in exchange for political favors. In the wake of these revelations, Mayor Barthelemy and four state lawmakers, Republicans Jim Donelon, Kernan \\"Skip\\" Hand, and Ken Hollis and the Democrat Steve Theriot, all from the New Orleans suburbs, admitted to having awarded Tulane University scholarships to family members. Specifically, it was learned that state officials were able to request a tuition waiver ‚Äî worth some $17,000 in 1993 - to one student per year under an 1884 state law approving the conversion of the public University of Louisiana into a private institution, Tulane University, upon the school's receipt of Paul Tulane's and Josephine Newcomb's bequests. Nonetheless, Barthelemy was never viewed with great enmity, a testament to his essentially conciliatory leadership style. Fritz Windhorst, who served as a Republican member of the Louisiana State Senate from Jefferson and Orleans parishes from 1972 to 1992, described Barthelemy this way: \\"Sidney doesn't whine or complain when things go badly‚Ä¶He doesn't threaten people who cross him. Just having him as mayor has sharply reduced the anti-New Orleans feelings in the legislature.\\" Barthelemy was quite self-aware with regard to his temperament, viewing it as a strength and once remarking that, \\"People tend to underestimate me because I don't bang my fist on the table and jump up and scream...but I know how to get the job done and that's always been my aim ‚Äî to get things done.\\".Johnson 1986, p.121 After City Hall Although Barthelemy was the subject of much criticism during his time as mayor, he has more recently benefited from a reassessment of his mayoralty.Simerman 2012, p.1 In 2012, City Councilmember Cynthia Hedge Morrell remarked during an event at Gallier Hall, \\"\\"The city of New Orleans would not be where it is today if those tough decisions were not made and you had not had the fortitude to endure the wrath of the media and the wrath of people who did not understand\\" that \\"good decisions were being made for the future of our city\\".Simerman 2012, p.1 As a respected former mayor, Barthelemy joined other former mayors Moon Landrieu and Marc Morial in a meeting on January 7, 2006 with parish presidents from the New Orleans metropolitan area to discuss post-Katrina plans for regional flood protection .Donze 2012, p.1 Currently, Sidney Barthelemy is serving as the Director of Governmental Affairs for Historic Restoration, Inc.

William Keble Martin (9 July 1877, Radley ‚Äì 26 November 1969, Woodbury) was a Church of England priest, botanist and botanical illustrator, known for his Concise British Flora in Colour. The Concise British Flora was published in May 1965 when the author was 88. The book was the result of 60 years' meticulous fieldwork and exquisite painting skills, and became an immediate best-seller. He completed over 1,400 paintings in colour and many black-and-white drawings before the book was finally published. Western Walla Brook, Dartmoor Life and work St Blaise, Haccombe, Reverend Martin held the position of Archpriest here from 1921 to 1934. Keble Martin was the grandson of Dr George Moberly, headmaster of Winchester and later Bishop of Salisbury. He was brother to architect Arthur Campbell Martin CVO FRIBA (1875-1963) and was also connected to John Keble of the Oxford Movement. His father was appointed as the Rector of Dartington, near Totnes, when William was 14 years old. He was educated at Marlborough, and went up to Christ Church, Oxford in 1896 to read Greek Philosophy and Botany. He trained for the church at Cuddesdon Theological College. After ordination, he worked in industrial parishes in the north and Midlands (one of these was Wath-upon- Dearne, the subject of his first book) and, in the First World War, as a chaplain in France. In 1921 he was offered the benefice of Haccombe and Coffinswell in Devon and in 1934 became the incumbent of St Michael and All Angels, Great Torrington. (He was the Archpriest of Haccombe and Rector of Coffinswell.) Keble Martin saw a vision of a new church in a dream, and his brother architect transformed the dream into reality - now a listed building, St Luke the Evangelist Church at Milber, Newton Abbot is remarkable for its exceptional interior space and extraordinary plan with three angled naves, linked by arcades with granite columns, which converge on the central altar. The exterior walls are white render with a pyramidal copper-clad roof on a squat square tower. Keble Martin retired in 1949 at the age of 72, but continued to work in the church. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1928, and later edited with G. T. Fraser the first volume of a comprehensive Flora of Devon (1939). In June 1966 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from Exeter University. Four of his designs for an issue of wild flower stamps were accepted by the Royal Mail and issued in April 1967. He published his autobiography, Over the Hills, shortly before he died in 1969 at the age of 92 at Woodbury.

It ended with a Montenegrin victory. Prelude In the winter of 1915, the Army of Montenegro had been fighting Austro-Hungary for three months in Serbia. In January 1916 they had to resist the invasion of their own territory. The Montenegrin Army was weakened by the harsh weather and lack of supplies. On 5 January 1916, they received a command to protect the retreat of the Serbian army to Corfu via Albania. Savo Lazareviƒá was commander of Montenegrin Royal Gendarmerie which was part of ƒåakor Detachment during the Battle of Mojkovac. Battle The fighting culminated on 6 and 7 January 1916 (on Orthodox Christmas; also known as 'Bloody Christmas'). Led by Serdar (Count) Janko VukotiƒáDjilas, Milovan (1958) Land Without Justice Harcourt, Brace, New York, page 161, with Krsto Zrnov Popoviƒá as second in command, the Montenegrin army inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarian forces and temporarily halted their advancement. The Montenegrin army had entrenched themselves around the village of Mojkovac. Austro-Hungarian forces attacked the army's positions early that day along with a heavy artillery bombardment on Mojkovac itself. By noon, the Austro-Hungarian attack was repulsed, suffering heavy casualties. Fighting resumed from then on, until the Austro-Hungarian forces left the battlefield, leaving more than 2,000 of their soldiers dead. By the end of the day, Montenegrin forces were able to push back multiple attacks made by Austro- Hungarian forces, taking back control of Mojkovac and its surroundings. Much of the fighting was done hand-to-hand with fixed bayonets and knives, in knee- deep snow. On 7 January, the Austro-Hungarians launched a second attack on Montenegrin positions. The attack again failed, with heavy losses on both sides. Despite having a much stronger, larger, and better-equipped army, Austro-Hungarian forces abandoned their positions in Mojkovac on the 7th and retreated. Results There is considerable disagreement about the actual conduct of the battle,Vucinich, Louis Andrew (1974) God and the Villagers: A story of Montenegro Buffalo State College Foundation, Buffalo, New York, pages 313-314, but the Montenegrins forced a numerically superior foe to retreat. The battle was intended to give the Serbian Army enough time reach the Albanian mountains in their retreat to Corfu, but in fact most of the Serbian troops had already crossed the mountains and reached the coast and were battling their way south between Scutari (Shkod√´r) and Durazzo (Durr√´s).Roberts, Elizabeth (2005) Realm of the Black Mountain: A History of Montenegro Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, page 311, Djilas (1958) page 162 The Montenegrin army continued to hold the Berane-Andrijevica- Mojkovac-Tara River line until withdrawing on 18 January.Mitroviƒá, Andrej (2007) Serbia's great war, 1914-1918 Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, Indiana, page 155, The Austrians then continued pushing their offensive south. In the meantime, the Austro-Hungarians had already taken Mount Lovƒáen (11/1), the capital Cetinje (13/1), Peƒá and Berane (10/1). Some historians indicate that at the time of the battle King Nicholas was already in surrender negotiations and that several units had already surrendered,Vucinich (1974) page 70 but others hold that King Nicholas did not agree to negotiate until 12 January.Pavlovic, Srdja (2008) Balkan Anschluss: the annexation of Montenegro and the creation of the common South Slavic state Purdue University Press, West Lafayette, Indiana, page 77, However, by 25 January the entire army of Montenegro had laid down its weapons. Generalmajor Rein√∂hl said of the battle: \\"The courage of the Montenegrin soldier has no equal in the history of wars. Here you could see the Montenegrin soldier attacking the bayonets of the enemy with his bare hands. That numerically small army, armed with primitive weapons, on the terrain of Mojkovac for days stopped the much more numerous Austro- Hungarian Army, equipped with modern arms.\\" See also * Serbian Campaign (World War I) Notes References Cyril Falls, The Great War, p. 140 * Mojkovac Mojkovac Mojkovac Mojkovac Mojkovac Mojkovac Mojkovac Mojkovac January 1916 events Mojkovac ","title":"Battle of Mojkovac"},{"id":"2937325","text":"This is an incomplete list of notable Muslim theologians.

It is the home venue of Argentinos Juniors, and has a capacity of 26,000. It was given its name in 2004 in honour of the former Argentinos player Diego Maradona who made his professional debut here in 1976, following the refurbishment of the ground, and to celebrate the club's centenary year.  History  Before the construction of this stadium, there was another one on the same place, wooden made, which first opened in 1940. Since it was small and unsafe, it was left apart in the early 1980s, and the football team moved its basis to the nearer Arquitecto Ricardo Etcheverri stadium, in the neighbourhood of Caballito. The idea was to build a modern and bigger stadium with the 5,800,000 dollars that the club received from the transfer of Diego Armando Maradona to the FC Barcelona but finally that money was invested in constructing other venues at the multisport complex Las Malvinas, owned by the same club, and in bringing some first level footballers in order to succeed at the national championship. The project of the new stadium had to wait until the next decade. In 1995, the old stadium was demolished, but at the same time a deep economic crisis hit the club and continued for a long time, delaying the works for eight years. Finally, in 2003, the new stadium was finished, and opened on December 26. Six months later, the team returned to the Argentinean First Division, where it is now based. The opening ceremony included two football games between the 1984 team, that won the first national championship for the club versus the team that won the second division tournament in 1997, and another one between the Argentinean U-20 national team and a mix of some of the best players born in the club's youth divisions such as Juan Pablo Sor√≠n, Esteban Cambiasso, Diego Placente, Carlos Mac Allister, Claudio Borghi, Fabricio Coloccini, Leonel Gancedo and Sergio Batista together with some other remarkable footballers that played in Argentinos, such as Ubaldo Fillol. Lionel Messi made his debut with the Argentina U20 national team in this stadium and scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Paraguay on 29 June 2004.

The film is a sequel to DaVinci's War, and its plot concerns a CIA rogue division war against the criminal underworld. It was the first starring role for Anna Nicole Smith, coming after being named Playboy Playmate of the Year.  Plot summary  Anna Nicole Smith plays Vickie Lynn, an ex-CIA agent going by the pseudonym \\"Collette\\" who is attempting to track down the leader of an organization of trained assassins to exact revenge for the murder of her husband. Joey Travolta is Frank DaVinci, an ex Vietnam War veteran who is also after the same man for his own reasons. In light of this, they agree to work together to track him down with the help of Lynn's boyfriend, assassin China Smith, played by Michael Nouri. In the opening scenes, Vickie's husband is killed in a car bombing, which forces her to go into hiding. Meanwhile, Da Vinci's wedding is interrupted when a large group of masked gunmen attack the ceremony resulting in a massive shootout where Da Vinci is wounded, but his young bride Lupe (played by Rebecca Ferratti) is killed, along with several civilians, as well as several of Da Vinci's bodyguards, and all of the attacking gunmen are killed as well. In the hospital, another attempt is made on Da Vinci's life when a female assassin, named Maryann, attempts to kill him in his hospital bed by injecting a syringe into his I.V. drip, but he survives by pulling out the I.V. drip in time. After this, Da Vinci goes into hiding at his retreat house in Las Vegas. Six months later, Da Vinci recovers enough when, by chance, he runs into Vickie whom they agree to help each other find the person responsible for the losses of their loved ones.

He was notable at court for his jousting, at the Accession Day Tilts, which were highlights of the year at court. Two famous survivals, his portrait miniature by Nicholas Hilliard (c. 1590, now National Maritime Museum) and a garniture of Greenwich armour (now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art), reflect this important part of his life. In contrast, he neglected his estates in the far north of England, and left a long succession dispute between his heirs. Early life and wardship Brougham Castle, birthplace of George Clifford, a residence of the Clifford family since the late 13th century George Clifford was born on 8 August 1558 at Brougham Castle in Westmorland, the son and heir of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland (d. January 1570) by his second wife, Anne Dacre, daughter of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre. The Barons de Clifford, a junior branch of the Clifford feudal barons of Clifford of Clifford Castle in Herefordshire, had established themselves in the late 13th century at Appleby Castle in Westmorland, in the north of England. George succeeded as Earl of Cumberland and Baron de Clifford when his father died in 1570, leaving George a minor, aged 12. His valuable wardship and marriage was granted by Queen Elizabeth I to Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, KG (died 1585), who in 1577, married George off to his daughter Lady Margaret Russell (1560‚Äì1616). The marriage had been arranged in their infancy by their respective fathers, which later did not prove to be a happy one. Life at court Life at court meant that George spent an increasing amount of time in southern England, away from his family's estates. As a result, Brougham Castle, one of his properties in the north, was neglected and abandoned. Although in 1589, he built the original Londesborough Hall, an Elizabethan country house located in East Riding of Yorkshire. George's fellow courtier commented on his northern upbringing, writing to the steward of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, that he disliked Clifford as \\"the rudest Earll by reson of his northerly bringen up\\".G. Dyfnallt Owen, ed., HMC, Manuscripts Marquess of Bath, vol. 5 (London, HMSO, 1980), p. 257: Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine, vol. 18 (1879), p. 279 George Clifford was described as a man of great personal beauty, strong and active, accomplished in all knightly exercises, splendid in his dress, and of romantic valour. On the other hand, he was a gambler and a spendthrift, a faithless husband, and later, for several years before his death, was separated from his wife. Queen's Champion and KG Quartered arms of Sir George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, KG Clifford rose in the world as an accomplished jouster, and became Queen Elizabeth's second Champion on the retirement of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley. A portrait miniature by Nicholas Hilliard, around 1590, commemorates the appointment, showing him in tilting attire with the Queen's glove, set in diamonds, pinned as a plume to his hat as a sign of her favour. The Queen made him a Knight of the Garter in 1592, and he sat as a Peer in the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. Clifford was also involved in the formation of the East India Company.East India Company Naval career Clifford was a man of irregular life, and having run through a great part of his very handsome property, seized on the opportunity offered by the war with Spain to re-establish himself. In 1588, he commanded the galleon Elizabeth Bonaventure in the Anglo-Spanish War, during which he had had some success. He led and invested in a number of expeditions, but many were turned back due to storms or lack of prizes. His first success was an expedition to the Azores in 1589, taking a number of Portuguese and Spanish prizes. He suffered losses in the Battle of Berlengas Islands in 1591, and in 1592 he helped to prepare an expedition with Walter Raleigh, which led to the Battle of Flores, and the capture of the richly laden Portuguese ship, Madre de Deus, off Flores Island in the Azores. At the end of 1593, Clifford financed three ships for a further expedition to the Azores, which resulted in the Action of Faial between the English and a joint Iberian/Portuguese fleet. Clifford later commissioned the building of his own ship, the 38-gun Scourge of Malice. During the Battle of San Juan in 1598, he achieved fame for having briefly captured Fort San Felipe del Morro, the citadel protecting San Juan, Puerto Rico. Clifford and his force of men had arrived in Puerto Rico on 15 June 1598, but by November of that year had fled the island due to harsh civilian resistance. Clifford was often spoken of as a sort of nautical Quixote, a title curiously unsuitable to the courtier, gambler, and buccaneer, in all of which guises history presents him. His love of adventure was strong, and he staked his money on the success of his cruises in much the same spirit that he did on the speed of his horses or the turn of his dice. And he spared his body no more than his purse. His courage was unimpeachable, and the temper which he showed in times of difficulty, won him both credit and popularity. All the great wealth he gained from his buccaneering, he lost in jousting and horse racing, and was eventually obliged to sell his inherited lands. Marriage, children and succession dispute Anne Clifford as a girl at left and as a mature woman at right. The central panel shows her parents and young brothers.Abbot Hall Art Gallery In 1577, George married Lady Margaret Russell (1560‚Äì1616), a daughter of his guardian Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford and Margaret St John. Earl Russell had acquired his valuable wardship, as well as the right to marry George off to whomsoever he chose. By his wife Margaret, George had the following children: *Sir Robert Clifford (21 September 158524 May 1591), died young before the age of 5. *Francis Clifford (15848 December 1589), died young before the age of 5. *Lady Anne Clifford, suo jure 14th Baroness de Clifford (30 January 159022 March 1676), his daughter and sole heiress, and wife of Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset. Clifford's two sons, Robert and Francis, had both died young, before the age of 5, thus his only surviving child and daughter Anne became his sole heiress. She inherited the title Baron de Clifford suo jure, having been created by writ in 1299 to be able to descend in the female line. She also inherited ¬£15,000. The vast majority of his estate, however, Clifford bequeathed to his brother Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, who also inherited the earldom, which by the letters patent of its creation was precluded from passing to a female, as was usual. After lengthy litigation, Clifford's daughter Anne won much of the land, including Brougham and Appleby castles. The Great Picture is a large triptych group portrait, measuring 8 ft 5\\" high and 16 ft 2\\" wide, commissioned in 1646 by Lady Anne Clifford, attributed to Jan van Belcamp (1610‚Äì1653). It formerly hung in Appleby Castle and is now displayed at the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal, Cumbria. It depicts Lady Anne as a girl, at the left, and as a mature woman, at the right. The central panel shows her parents and her small brothers. The painting is replete with significant elements, referring to her life and to her succession to her paternal inheritance, gained after a lengthy legal dispute, only settled in 1617. The House of Lords postponed the hearing of the matter of the barony, which remained dormant until 1678, when Nicholas Tufton, 3rd Earl of Thanet, was allowed to claim the peerage and become the fifteenth Baron de Clifford. Death and burial Chest tomb of George Clifford in Holy Trinity Church, Skipton George Clifford died on 30 October 1605 at the duchy house of the Savoy in London. His body was embalmed and buried in the family vault at Skipton Castle in Craven, Yorkshire, his family seat, where a black marble altar tomb to his memory was erected by his daughter, Lady Anne Clifford. Also, his chest tomb monument survives in Holy Trinity church, Skipton, adjacent to the castle. It is profusely decorated with heraldry, showing the arms of Clifford quartering Vipont (the feudal barons of Appleby, from whom the Cliffords inherited Appleby Castle and vast estates in Westmorland), impaling the arms of Russell as well as the wives of Clifford's paternal predecessors: Beauchamp, de Roos, Percy, Dacre, Berkeley, Neville, etc. Suit of armour Sir George Clifford's tournament armour, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York George Clifford's tournament armour survives and is considered the finest surviving garniture of the Tudor period. As Queen's Champion, Clifford's armour has been unrivaled in beauty. It was made at the Greenwich armoury established by King Henry VIII, and a drawing of it is included in the Jacob Album, a book of designs for 29 different armours for various Elizabethan gentlemen. Clifford's armour, being part of a garniture, includes many pieces of exchange, including a grandguard, an extra helmet, a shaffron, and several lance guards. These extra pieces allowed the wearer to modify his armour for different forms of tournament combat. The armour is of blued steel and is etched and inlaid with elaborate gilded designs, incorporating columns of alternating fleurs-de-lis and Tudor roses, with the letter E for Queen Elizabeth I. It is on display in the Armor Court at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, next to the two suits of armour of Sir James Scudamore, which were also made at the Greenwich armoury. The design of the New York armour is very different to the one he wears in the famous full-length portrait miniature by Nicolas Hilliard, which Hilliard perhaps invented. In literature In Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando: A Biography, the \\"Earl of Cumberland\\" discovers Orlando and his lover asleep amongst his cargo and believes them to be ghosts sent to punish him for buccaneering. In his terror the Earl vows to mend his ways and, in repentance, founds a row of almshouses. Although not explicitly stated, the Earl referred to must be the 3rd Earl, due to the relevant action in the novel occurring shortly after the death of Queen Elizabeth I.

Snot set out to work on their second album, but in December, lead singer Lynn Strait died in a car accident. The group decided not to continue on, although the album Strait Up was released in 2000 as a tribute to Lynn, with guest vocalists from various bands contributing. = TheStart = Smith went on to form a band called Hero with former Snot drummer Jamie Miller, as well as Aimee Echo & Scott Ellis of Human Waste Project. In July 1999, Hero were signed to 143 Records/Atlantic Records and recorded their debut album named \\"Circles.\\" The band was forced to change their name due to legal issues. At the suggestion of Aimee's mother, they changed it to TheStart. In late 2000, Mike Smith left the band. After various issues, the album was eventually released in July 2001 under The Label/Geffen Records and renamed Shakedown!, with the bulk of Smith's parts recut by Miller. = Limp Bizkit = In late 2001, Limp Bizkit was left without a guitar player due to the departure of Wes Borland. The entire ordeal of choosing a new guitarist was taken very slowly, with various options taken into consideration. Initially, a nationwide audition, entitled \\"Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is,\\" was carried out to find a guitarist for the band, but nobody was chosen out of the thousands of participants. Smith had known members of the band previously, as they were friends with Snot. They decided to give him a shot at the position, and in 2002, he was chosen as the band's guitarist. Fred wanted Mike to create a full album of songs with the band in between their performance at WrestleMania XIX and The Summer Sanitarium Tour. Together they wrote and recorded at least 14 songs of which 7 of them made it onto their fourth studio album, Results May Vary. Mike toured with the band throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004, but in mid-2004 they parted ways. To this day both parties kept very quiet on the issue.

Career Wood was a member of Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement and became a Branch Leader.Mosley Remembered Part OneMosley Remembered Part Three He remained in the UM until 1964, when he joined the British National Party. Remaining with the BNP, Wood became a founding member of the National Front when it was formed in 1967. He was later expelled after it was discovered he had joined under the assumed name John Howard ffrench (two lower-case f's). Wood left the British far right not long after this as work commitments took him to the Federal Republic of Germany. While there, he established links with the National Democratic Party. After returning to Britain, Wood linked up with Eddy Morrison in Leeds and followed him into the New National Front. In April 1982 at the Charing Cross Hotel in London, Wood was present at the launch of the (third) British National Party. John Tyndall and a few others, including Charles Parker, Tyndall's father-in-Law, wanted the new party to be called the National Party but Wood, under pressure from a great majority of northern nationalists in Leeds and Manchester, persuaded Tyndall to adopt the name of the BNP.Ray Hill & Andrew Bell, The Other Face of Terror, Grafton Books, 1988, p. 166 At the meeting Wood announced that he was there as a representative of the League of Saint George. Wood remained with the BNP until 1990, when he resigned from the party due to personality clashes with some moderate senior officers. He continued to appear as a guest speaker at party events, fulfilling a similar function for the NF and other groups, without formally participating in any group. Wood joined the NF in the late 1990s when Morrison became the group's organiser in Yorkshire, although the two became estranged soon afterwards.Searchlight, No. 363, September 2005, p. 25 However they eventually renewed their alliance and when the White Nationalist Party was formed in 2002, Wood was offered the position of propaganda and training officer, which he accepted. Later, in 2003, he led the party as national organiser.Searchlight, No. 364, October 2005, p. 9 In 2004 he sided with Morrison as the group split and became part of a tendency known as the Spearhead Support Group.Searchlight, No. 355, January 2005, p. 12 This group was loosely associated with John Tyndall in his ultimately failed attempt to regain the leadership of the British National Party from Nick Griffin, although it also flirted with the NF.Searchlight, No. 357, March 2005, p. 19 As this group began to disintegrate Wood briefly served as leader of a rump WNP before in 2005 agreeing to merge into the Nationalist Alliance, another group that Morrison had established a few months earlier. This group further split in September 2005 with Wood joining Morrison and Kevin Watmough in establishing the British Peoples Party as a new entity.Searchlight, No. 364, October 2005, p. 23 Wood became chairman of the BPP with Morrison as national organiser.Searchlight, No. 368, February 2006, p. 13 Wood's membership was short-lived however as he was expelled from the BPP following personality clashes with Morrison and Watmough, who would publicly accuse Wood of being an ideological \\"traitor\\" without elaborating on the claim.Searchlight, No. 379, January 2007, p. 17 This marked the effective end of his political career and he decided to distance himself from fringe politics. From then and until his death, Wood enjoyed a semi-retirement from nationalist politics. Nonetheless in 2006 he applied to rejoin the BNP, but his application was turned down by the BNP's leadership. Despite this, Wood maintained good relations with his local BNP branch in Sheffield and provided the branch with both advice and financial support in the run up to the UK's 2007 local elections.

Caperton (1850‚Äì1941). Caperton was launched 22 May 1943 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Miss M. Caperton; and commissioned 30 July 1943, Commander W. J. Miller in command. Service history Caperton sailed from Boston 8 October 1943 for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 6 November to begin the operations which would stamp her as one of the \\"fightingest\\" destroyers of the Pacific theater. After delivering explosives at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, 28‚Äì29 November, the destroyer covered the Gilbert Islands through patrol until 8 January 1944, when she put back to Pearl Harbor. Here she joined the screen of the mighty Fast Carrier Task Force, with which she steamed in the intensive series of operations which marked the advance of the Navy across the Pacific. (Then 5th Fleet's Task Force 58, later 3rd Fleet's TF 38.) On 30 January 1944, Caperton joined in the bombardment of Kwajalein, and from her base at Majuro, took part in the air strikes on Truk and Saipan in February. Caperton cleared Espiritu Santo 15 March 1944 for the air operations covering the invasion of Emirau Island, then sailed for the stunning blows hurled from the air at the Japanese on Palau, Yap, Woleai, and Ulithi late in March. Tireless TF 58 continued the crescendo pace of its attacks, and in April Caperton screened air strikes preparatory to the invasion of Hollandia, saw the force's planes hit Truk once more, and blasted at Satawan and Ponape in shore bombardment. On 6 June 1944, Caperton sortied from Majuro for the Marianas operation, which culminated in the fury of the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. Screening the American carriers as they launched the strikes which would cripple Japanese naval aviation, Caperton interposed her blazing antiaircraft fire between enemy air attacks and the carriers. Moving on to cover the attacks preparatory to the return of United States forces to Guam, Caperton sailed close inshore to provide lifeguard services for carrier strikes, and on 25 June braved the fire of enemy shore batteries to shell and sink a cargo ship in Apra Harbor. Through July, she operated in the Marianas, and late in the month screened air strikes on Yap and Palau. Caperton got underway from Eniwetok 30 August 1944 to rendezvous with TF 38 for the well-planned bombardments and air strikes which paved the way for the return to the Philippines. The Palaus, Mindanao, Visayas, and Luzon were blasted from the air, while Peleliu, Angaur, and the Ngesebus felt the might of the force's guns. The destroyer replenished at Ulithi, and resumed screening duty for the strikes intended to deny the Japanese the use of their bases on Okinawa and Formosa in the forthcoming Leyte invasion. In the 3-day Formosa air battle which resulted, and were torpedoed from the air. Caperton was assigned to screen the cripples to safety, and to guard them while they were used as bait in the effort to bring the Japanese surface units into battle. When the stricken cruisers were safely out of range of enemy air attack, Caperton returned to screen TF 38 in the air strikes of the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf, which developed from the all- out efforts of the Japanese to break up the Leyte landings. Strikes flown from the carriers of Caperton's group inflicted the final losses on the Japanese Center Force, and she with others pursued the retreating Japanese north, without making surface contact. Continued operations supporting the invasion of the Philippines kept Caperton at sea from her base at Ulithi. When was torpedoed on 4 November 1944, Caperton took her injured and other survivors on board, and after weathering the furious typhoon of 18 December, she steamed for air strikes on Formosa, Luzon, Camranh Bay, Hong Kong, Canton, and Okinawa. An overhaul on the west coast prepared the destroyer for picket duty off Okinawa through May and June 1945. The desperate Japanese suicide air attacks made radar picket duty off embattled Okinawa one of the most dangerous duties of the war, but Caperton served her tour unscathed; constantly vigilant both to protect herself and provide for effective use of her radar warning equipment. On 29 June 1945, Caperton rejoined TF 38 for the final air strikes on the Japanese home islands, which continued until the close of the war. After several months of occupation duty at Tokyo, Caperton returned to the east coast of the United States, where she was decommissioned at Charleston, South Carolina, 6 July 1946. The battle-tried veteran was recommissioned 6 April 1951, as the fleet was augmented to meet the threat posed by the Korean War. With Newport as her home port, Caperton operated locally until the fall of 1952, when she sailed to northern Europe for North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Operation Mainbrace. After preparing by fleet exercises in the Caribbean early in 1953, Caperton cleared Newport 27 April for the Panama Canal and duty in the Far East, arriving at Yokosuka, Japan 2 June for duty with TFs 77 and 95. With the first, she screened air strikes on Chinese and North Korean Communists; with the second, she took part in the blockade and bombardment of Korea's coast. After further hunter-killer operations off Korea, she sailed on 9 October to call at the Philippines, Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Cannes, and Lisbon, thus rounding the world before her return to Newport 21 May 1954. Five months of operations with North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces in northern Europe in 1954, and a good-will visit to Guayaquil, Ecuador, in 1955 highlighted a period of local operations and training which preceded Caperton's patrol operations in the Atlantic during the Suez crisis of November 1956. On 21 January 1957, Caperton sailed for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean during which she sailed with the carrier striking force in the eastern Mediterranean during the Jordan crisis. Returning to Newport in June, the destroyer's next lengthy deployment was her participation from 3 September to 27 November in North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Operation Strikeback in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. Operations off the east coast, in the Caribbean, with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean (including visits to Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports), and combined operations with Canadian forces continued through 1959. Caperton was placed out of commission in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 April 1960. Awards Caperton received 10 battle stars for World War II service, and 1 for service in the Korean War.

History =Early beginnings= KKXT was founded in 1950 by the Elkins Institute, at the time known as Texas Trade School, as KVTT 88.5 FM (\\"The Voice of Texas Trade School\\"). The school used it as a training ground for students including Rush Limbaugh and moved to 91.7 FM in the late 1960s to early 1970s. =Transition to a Christian format= In 1976, Eldred Thomas, the founder of Covenant Educational Media, bought KVTT and turned it into a Christian music and teaching station. Thomas took KVTT's original call letters and created the \\"Keep Voicing The Truth\\" tagline. From its studios in North Dallas, it carried a variety of teaching programs, talk-format programs, and Praise and Worship music, along with their long-running and highest rated program for 20 years, The Journey hosted by Tom Dooley, who died on November 9, 2010. Logo used from 1986 until 2004 sale to Covenant Educational Media In July 2001, KVTT license holder Research Educational Foundation, Inc., applied to transfer the broadcast license for this station to The Learning Foundation, Inc. The reported $5 million sale price would have also included the station's donor list for the preceding two years. The transfer was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 24, 2001, but the deal ultimately fell through. The license remained with the Research Educational Foundation. Logo used following sale to Covenant Educational Media In July 2004, Research Educational Foundation, Inc., again applied to transfer the license for KVTT, this time to Covenant Educational Media, Inc. The sale price for this single non-commercial station was reported as $16.5 million. The transfer was approved by the FCC on September 21, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on November 16, 2004. =KVTT's failed swap bid= In June 2006, KVTT's owners tried to broker a frequency swap with WRR (101.1 FM), a commercial radio station owned by the City of Dallas. The swap would allow the relocated KVTT to sell commercial advertising to increase its revenue stream. Even though one official estimated the deal \\"could be worth up to $50 million\\" to the city of Dallas, the swap was ultimately rejected by the city. =Sale to KERA= It was announced on June 9, 2009, that Covenant Educational Media would be selling this station to North Texas Public Broadcasting (owners of KERA (90.1 FM) and KERA-TV) for $18 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 30, 2009, and the transaction was consummated on September 28, 2009. It was said to be the biggest single radio station sale to that point in 2009. The 2008 economic downturn, coupled by a shortfall of donations from its \\"share-a-thon\\" and an \\"urgent\\" fundraiser, led to the sale of KVTT. The station's now-previous owners have vowed to keep the Christian format in operation in some capacity. The final broadcasting day for the Christian format on 91.7 FM was September 28; on that date, the station moved its programming to a daytime-only station, KJSA (1110 AM).KVTT: \\"Will we be silenced?\\", 9/9/2009. In addition, the station also provided its programming via the internet from its website, kvtt.org. The KVTT call sign was then transferred to Covenant's sister station in Palisade, Colorado, KAAI, on October 1, 2009. On October 14, 2009, the KVTT call sign returned to the D/FW area on the AM station formerly licensed as KJSA, which was transferred to the Colorado station (that station has since reverted to KAAI). =91.7 today= right On October 1, 2009, the 91.7 frequency became \\"KKXT\\", and the station temporarily went silent; programming, under the moniker \\"KXT 91.7\\", began on November 9. The format flip to adult album alternative also occurred on that date. The station carried national and locally produced music programming. Music programs formerly heard on KERA FM moved to 91.7, including 90.1 at Night, which was renamed as The Paul Slavens Show . With the format change of long-time alternative station KDGE to adult contemporary in November 16, 2016, KKXT was considered the de facto alternative station for the market until November 17, 2017 (almost one year later after KDGE's flip) when Entercom purchased CBS Radio and flipped KVIL to alternative as \\"Alt 103.7\\" (its current competitor). As of early February 2017, KKXT also broadcasts a digital signal using the iBiquity \\"HD Radio\\" system.

Driscoll (born 1970) is an American evangelical pastor and author best known as the founder of Mars Hill Church. He is currently Senior and Founding Pastor of The Trinity Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, which was founded in 2016. In 1996, Driscoll co-founded Mars Hill Church in Seattle, Washington. As of March 2014, Mars Hill Church had 14,000 members in five states and fifteen locations. He also founded The Resurgence (a theological cooperative) and co- founded other parachurch organizations, such as Acts 29 Network, Churches Helping Churches, and The Gospel Coalition. He has written for the \\"Faith and Values\\" section of the Seattle Times, OnFaith, and the Fox News website. Driscoll has also authored a number of popular Christian books, including A Call to Resurgence. Driscoll has been described as \\"an evangelical bad boy, a gifted orator and [a] charismatic leader\\" who is \\"hip yet hard-line\\". A conservative evangelical, he favors \\"vintage\\" aesthetics and a \\"down to earth\\", \\"aggressive\\" preaching style. Controversy has surrounded his teachings on gender roles, his alleged plagiarism, and the culture of fear that allegedly existed during his tenure at Mars Hill. In the summer of 2014, Driscoll faced public criticism and formal complaints from Mars Hill staff members and congregants due to behavior that they described as abusive. In August 2014, the board of Acts 29 Network removed him from its membership and urged him to step down from ministry. On October 14, 2014, Driscoll resigned from Mars Hill Church. Within three months of Driscoll's resignation, Mars Hill Church was dissolved.  Early life  Driscoll was born on October 11, 1970, in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He was raised Roman Catholic in the Riverton Heights area of SeaTac, Washington, which he described as \\"a very rough neighborhood\\" where serial killer Ted Bundy had picked up victims. Citing . He is the oldest of five children and the son of a union drywaller. He described a difficult family history of abuse and crime, writing: \\"The men on my father's side include uneducated alcoholics, mental patients, and women beaters. ... One of the main reasons my parents moved from North Dakota to Seattle was to get away from some family members when I was a very young boy.\\" In high school, he met his future wife, Grace Martin, daughter of Gib Martin, an evangelical pastor. In 1989, he graduated from Highline High School in Burien, Washington, where he served as student body president, captain of the baseball team, editor of the school newspaper, and the \\"most likely to succeed\\" in his graduating class. At age 19, as a college freshman, Driscoll converted to evangelical Christianity. The same year, according to Driscoll, \\"God spoke to me ... He told me to marry Grace, preach the Bible, train men, and plant churches ... I began preparing to devote my life to obey [God's] call for me.\\" He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from Washington State University with a minor in philosophy and holds a Master of Arts degree in exegetical theology from Western Seminary.  Career at Mars Hill Church  After graduation, Mark and Grace relocated to Seattle, where they attended Antioch Bible Church and worked with that church's college ministry as volunteers. Mark was hired as an intern a few months later. Through his internship, Mark met Mike Gunn, who worked for an Athletes in Action ministry at the University of Washington, and Lief Moi, a radio show host. The three men began to discuss planting an \\"urban, postmodern\\" church in Seattle. Greg Kappas, the pastor responsible for Antioch Bible Church's new church planting ministry, mentored the three and helped them develop their plans. = Founding Mars Hill Church = Driscoll, Lief Moi, and Mike Gunn founded Mars Hill Church in spring 1995 and officially launched it in fall 1996. The church first met in the Driscolls' home. By spring 1997, the church had relocated and expanded to two services. Driscoll later reflected that he was \\"not ready\\" when he planted Mars Hill at age 25. Mars Hill Church's main campus in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood Later in 1997, he was invited to speak at a Leadership Network pastors' conference in California. The speech he made inspired many within the nascent emerging church movement and, according to Driscoll, shifted the movement's focus from reaching Generation X to reaching the postmodern world.. \\"And it shifted the conversation from reaching Generation X to the emerging mission of reaching postmodern culture.\\" As a result, Mars Hill Church and Driscoll were thrust into the national spotlight: he was interviewed on National Public Radio and Mother Jones magazine published a feature on the church.. \\"I was not prepared for the media onslaught that came shortly thereafter. Before I knew it, NPR was interviewing me, Mother Jones magazine did a feature on our church, Pat Robertson's 700 Club gave me a plaque for being America's \\"Church of the Week\\" and did a television story on us, other media outlets started asking for interviews, large denominations were asking me to be a consultant ...\\" Mars Hill Church grew from 160 members in 1996 to 350 in 1999. = Founding the Acts 29 Network = In 1998, Driscoll and David Nicholas founded the Acts 29 Network (\\"Acts 29\\"), a church planting network, in response to people approaching Driscoll for advice on planting churches. The goal of this parachurch organization was to plant 1000 new churches around the world \\"through recruiting, assessing, training, funding, and coaching.\\" Acts 29 started slowly under Driscoll's tenure, with 11 churches at its inception and 17 by 2003. At that point, it began to grow rapidly, reaching 50 churches by 2006 and 410 churches by 2011. The majority are still located in the U.S., with 38 churches in 16 other countries. According to Salon, Driscoll structured Acts 29 to match his own \\"strict orthodoxy and views\\" on theology and politics, while allowing latitude in cultural specifics. Among other specifics, prospective Acts 29 church planters must be led by men. = The Resurgence = In 2006, Driscoll founded The Resurgence, a \\"theological cooperative\\" to support Acts 29 and Mars Hill Church. The Resurgence aims to train church leaders in conservative reformed theology. It has three main branches: Re:Lit, a publishing house; Re:Train, a missional training centre; and Re:Sound, a music arm. = Mars Hill Church reorganization (2006‚Äì2007) =  Rationale  Driscoll, Mars Hill's first paid pastor, had been its main preaching pastor and public face since its inception. As the church grew, he began to train other elders and deacons, moving himself into a more executive role in setting vision and continuing to preach. By 2006, the church counted 4000‚Äì5000 weekly attendees at three campuses in the Seattle region. In that year, Driscoll claimed that he had reached a personal crisis due to his \\"overwhelming workload\\"‚Äîat this time he was the principal authority in Mars Hill, president of Acts 29, president of The Resurgence, an author, and an international traveler with speaking engagements. He was, by his own account, sleeping only two to three hours per night and began to fear that he would die early from a heart attack. Ultimately, in 2006‚Äì2007, he began to restructure the church and claimed he was going to divest power. Within Mars Hill, he publicly stated that he resigned as \\"legal president\\", president of the elder board, and chief of staff, while retaining his roles as public face and preaching pastor. Prior to the reorganization, Mars Hill was governed by a full council of two dozen church elders (including Driscoll) who had equal voting authority and voted on major decisions, and a five-member council of \\"executive elders\\" (also including Driscoll) who handled daily operations but deferred to the full council for major decisions. According to then-Mars Hill pastor Paul Petry, in summer 2007, Driscoll \\"replaced the [executive council] with yes-men\\" and began to make major decisions--such as purchasing a $4 million new building-- without consulting the full council.  Proposed bylaw changes  In September 2007, Driscoll proposed changes to the bylaws that would grant indefinite terms of office to the \\"executive elders\\". Driscoll and proponents of the changes argued that the church had outgrown its original governing structure, while opponents contended that the changes consolidated power with Driscoll and his trusted lieutenants. Paul Petry and another pastor, Bent Meyer, both dissented from the changes. In response, Driscoll fired both from their jobs. A Mars Hill forum posting reported--without naming the pastors-- that one was fired for \\"displaying an unhealthy distrust in the senior leadership\\" and the other for \\"disregarding the accepted elder protocol for the bylaw deliberation period\\" and \\"verbally attacking the lead pastor [Driscoll].\\" The morning after Petry and Meyer were fired, Driscoll said to his pastors and other church leaders at a conference: \\"Yesterday we fired two elders for the first time in the history of Mars Hill. ... They were off mission, so now they're unemployed. This will be the defining issue as to whether or not you succeed or fail. I've read enough of the New Testament to know that occasionally Paul [the Apostle] puts somebody in the wood chipper.\\" In addition to the loss of their jobs, both were put on ecclesiastical trials to review their church membership. Petry was charged by Driscoll and the other elders with \\"lack of trust and respect for spiritual authority\\" and \\"improper use of confidential information\\", the latter charge because Petry had discussed the bylaw changes with church deacon Rob Smith, who was not part of the council of elders but had been asked to join. Petry was permitted to respond to the charges, but was not allowed to attend his full trial. The elders came to a unanimous conclusion that Petry was no longer qualified to be a church elder. Driscoll urged his congregation to shun Petry's family. Meyer was given a \\"gentler\\" ecclesiastical trial but chose to resign. Rob Smith had written an email to the elders calling for a fair trial for Petry and Meyer; Smith said that in response, Driscoll told his congregants to stop giving to Agathos, an independent economic development charity that Smith also ran, causing donations to drop by 80 percent.  Repercussions  In 2014, Petry, Smith, and Moi all joined--and, in some cases, organized--online protests against Driscoll. Commentators linked the summer 2014 \\"unrest\\" at Mars Hill to the structural changes of 2007, along with other developments in Driscoll's career. = ABC Nightline special (2009) = In March 2009, Driscoll was involved in an ABC Nightline debate entitled, \\"Does Satan Exist?\\" Driscoll and Annie Lobert, founder of the Hookers for Jesus Christian ministry, argued for the existence of the devil against the philosopher Deepak Chopra and Carlton Pearson, a former fundamentalist minister and author of The Gospel of Inclusion. A commentator described the debate as \\"contentious\\", with all participants taking \\"uncompromising\\" positions. Driscoll argued that a belief in both Satan and God was an essential tenet of Christianity. Driscoll has also been featured on the program discussing other topics including the Ten Commandments and sex. = Haiti relief (2010) = After the catastrophic 2010 Haiti earthquake, Driscoll and James MacDonald founded Churches Helping Churches to help churches rebuild after catastrophic natural disasters. They helped to rebuild dozens of churches in Haiti and Japan. Driscoll first flew to Haiti shortly after the earthquake, and set up a partnership between his church and Jean F. E. St. Cyr, a Haitian pastor. Mars Hill Church donated $1.7 million in medical supplies. = Resignation from Acts 29 and The Gospel Coalition (2012) = On March 29, 2012, Driscoll resigned as President of Acts 29 and from the Council of The Gospel Coalition, turning his responsibilities over to Matt Chandler. Commenting on the transition, Chandler said, \\"[the Acts 29 board was] running a network of 422 churches on six continents the same way when it was 80 to 100 churches on one continent.\\" Chandler also planned to disentangle Acts 29 from Mars Hill Church; prior to Driscoll's departure, Acts 29 was primarily funded by Mars Hill. By mid-2014, Driscoll was no longer on the board of Acts 29. Driscoll was a founding member of The Gospel Coalition, a fellowship of reformed evangelical churches. On his departure, he wrote he had no \\"relational conflict with anyone and no disagreement theologically\\"; rather, he explained that he was reorganizing his priorities and could not keep up with all of his commitments. Driscoll indicated that he intended to devote more of his efforts to Mars Hill Church, more time to his family, and less time to travel. = Formal charges filed by former elder Dave Kraft (2013) = In May 2013, former Mars Hill elder Dave Kraft filed formal charges (under Mars Hill Church bylaws) of \\"mistreatment\\" against Mark Driscoll and other leaders at Mars Hill. He specifically accused Driscoll of being \\"domineering, verbally violent, arrogant, and quick-tempered.\\" Kraft further argued that this \\"established pattern of ... behavior\\" disqualified Driscoll from church leadership.Specifically, Kraft said that Driscoll's behavior violated three different Bible passages that give the qualifications for church elders. Under Mars Hill bylaws, Driscoll is required to meet the biblical standards of a church elder. The passages are: , , and . Mars Hill Church's Board of Advisors and Accountability responded, saying that they sent one hundred letters to former elders and staff in an effort to substantiate Kraft's charges. They received eighteen responses, which they reviewed, and determined them to be \\"non-disqualifying\\" with respect to Driscoll's leadership position. However, the board did initiate a \\"reconciliation process\\" to address \\"many offenses and hurts that are still unresolved.\\" Dave Kraft worked at Mars Hill from 2005 to 2013 and was Driscoll's personal \\"coach\\" during that time. = Former leaders and members protest Driscoll (2014) = Michael Paulson, writing for The New York Times, wrote that while Driscoll has endured criticism from the American political left and liberal Christianity for many years, recent years leading up to and including 2014 saw the rise of criticism from conservative Christians, including Driscoll's former \\"allies and supporters.\\" According to the Seattle Times, accusations of plagiarism by talk radio host Janet Mefferd were a \\"crucial turning point\\" that drew outside interest into Mars Hill's internal affairs, and prompted inquiries from new critics about the church and how it handled its finances. After hearing of Mefferd's plagiarism accusations, evangelical Christian and Grove City College psychology professor Warren Throckmorton took interest and became a prominent critic of Driscoll and Mars Hill, documenting other examples of perceived plagiarism, abuse reported by former Mars Hill members, and questionable uses of church finances.  \\"Repentant Pastors\\"  On March 29, 2014, four former Mars Hill elders (Kyle Firstenberg, Dave Kraft, Scott Mitchell, and co-founder Lief Moi) created a blog titled \\"Repentant Pastor\\" and posted online \\"confessions and apologies\\" related to their leadership roles in Mars Hill. In a joint statement, they wrote, \\"we recognize and confess that Mars Hill has hurt many people within the Mars Hill community, as well as those outside the community.\\" Salon summarized the statements, writing that the former leaders emphasized their failures to \\"rein Driscoll in\\" and their complicity with Driscoll's \\"autocratic\\" management style. Firstenberg wrote that while the church appeared to flourish, employees lived in constant stress, and \\"success was to be attained regardless of human and moral cost.\\" Firstenberg added: > The reputation Driscoll got for being the cussing pastor simply because he > used harsh language from the pulpit was nothing compared to the swearing and > abusive language he used daily with staff. When people asked me how I liked > working at Mars Hill, I would simply say, \\"It is a great church to attend, > but I wouldn't recommend working here.\\" It was well known with the staff > that what was preached on Sunday was not lived out Monday morning with the > staff.  Driscoll addresses former members' complaints  In a recorded message shown to church members on July 27, 2014, Driscoll discussed the various controversies of 2014. He said that he could \\"not address some members' discontent ... because the complaints were anonymous.\\" According to Rob Smith, former program director at the church, the anonymity assertion \\"really touched a nerve\\" with former members. In response, dissenters organized a Facebook group called \\"Dear Pastor Mark & Mars Hill: We Are Not Anonymous.\\"  Public demonstration at Mars Hill Church  The following Sunday, \\"dozens of demonstrators\\" organized and picketed the Mars Hill Church Bellevue campus (where Driscoll preaches live), calling for Driscoll's resignation. Demonstrators carried placards reading \\"We Are Not Anonymous\\" and \\"Question Mark\\", and accused Driscoll of bullying, misogyny, inadequate transparency in church finances, and harsh discipline of members. Driscoll was away for his annual summer vacation. A church elder, Anthony Iannicielo, responded that the criticism of Driscoll and Mars Hill \\"goes with the territory\\" of running a large church with a long history. In a pre-recorded message, Driscoll said that he had been deliberately \\"rather silent\\" during the criticism, that he found it \\"a little overwhelming and a bit confusing\\", and indicated that he had no intention of resigning.  Removal from Acts 29 Network  On August 8, 2014, the board of Acts 29 removed both Driscoll and Mars Hill Church from membership. Chairman Matt Chandler wrote, \\"it is our conviction that the nature of the accusations against Mark, most of which have been confirmed by him, make it untenable and unhelpful to keep Mark [Driscoll] and Mars Hill [Church] in our network.\\" The board of directors of Acts 29 expressed gratitude for Driscoll's work with the Network as co-founder and former President, but declared his recent actions \\"ungodly and disqualifying behavior.\\" To Driscoll, they wrote, \\"our board and network have been the recipients of ... dozens of fires directly linked to you ... we are naturally associated with you and feel that this association discredits the network and is a major distraction.\\" They further advised him to \\"step down from ministry for an extended time and seek help.\\" Acts 29 had attempted to \\"lean on\\" the Mars Hill's Board of Advisors and Accountability (BOAA) to discipline Driscoll, but lost confidence in the board. The BOAA had been set up by Driscoll as his accountability board, rather than the elders of the church. (Members of the BOAA were for the most part professional clergy and businessmen who were not members of the church and hand picked by Driscoll.) The previous month, evangelical leaders and Acts 29 associates Paul Tripp and James MacDonald resigned from the BOAA. Religion correspondent Sarah Pulliam Bailey described Acts 29's decision as \\"unusual\\" since \\"ministries usually leave matters of church discipline up to local churches.\\" BOAA Chairman Michael Van Skaik responded, \\"Men, I told the lead pastors ... that we are making real progress in addressing the serious reconciliation and unhealthy culture issues that have been part of Mars Hill Church for way too long. And we are.\\" He further added that Acts 29 leaders did not contact Mars Hill before acting, and that Driscoll had \\"changed his ways\\", and described Acts 29's actions as \\"divisive\\". Van Skaik also addressed the formal charges brought against Driscoll under the Mars Hill bylaws, writing \\"the formal charges that were filed were serious, were taken seriously, and were not dismissed by the board lightly.\\"  Hiatus from ministry  On August 24, 2014, Driscoll announced he would take a six-week \\"extended focus break\\" from his pastorship while charges against him were investigated. Later that week, a letter signed by nine current Mars Hill pastors which severely criticized Driscoll was leaked to the public. The letter, written days before Driscoll stepped down, urged him to step down from all aspects of ministry. It included a quote from \\"internationally recognized\\" author, pastor and former BOAA member Paul Tripp saying, \\"This is without a doubt, the most abusive, coercive ministry culture I've ever been involved with.\\" One of the pastors who signed the letter was fired five days later for \\"rebellion against the church.\\" By September 9, eight of the nine pastors who signed the letter had resigned or been terminated, including worship director Dustin Kensrue. The last of the nine pastors was demoted from pastor to lay elder. Mars Hill Church's downtown Seattle campus, one of the first locations to close prior to Driscoll's resignation. The building is the historic Daniels Recital Hall, a former Methodist Episcopal church.  Other repercussions  LifeWay Christian Resources, a Christian bookseller and publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, announced on August 10, 2014 that they suspended sales of Driscoll's books. Marty King, communications director for LifeWay, said, \\"[we] are not selling Mark Driscoll's books while we assess the situation regarding his ministry.\\" King identified Acts 29's call for Driscoll to step down as \\"certainly a part\\" of their decision, along with the \\"cumulative effect\\" of other allegations against Driscoll. Driscoll was removed from the speaker roster of several planned Act Like Men conferences, which includes other Acts 29 speakers and past Driscoll associates, including James MacDonald and Matt Chandler. He was also removed as closing speaker at the Gateway Church Conference, an annual gathering of thousands of evangelical pastors. Mars Hill Church also cancelled their own Resurgence 2014 conference, planned for October 2014, since several planned speakers had cut ties with Driscoll. = Resignation from Mars Hill Church = In the fall of 2014, a group of elders released a report on an investigation into accusations of bullying and intimidating behavior by Driscoll made by 21 former church elders. The investigation involved \\"some 1,000 hours of research, interviewing more than 50 people and preparing 200 pages of information.\\" The report concluded that Driscoll had never been charged with \\"immorality, illegality or heresy,\\" and considered \\"some of the accusations against Pastor Mark to be altogether unfair or untrue.\\" Additionally, the report found that many of the \\"other charges had previously been addressed by Pastor Mark, privately and publicly. Indeed, he had publicly confessed and apologized for a number of the charges against him, some of which occurred as long as 14 years ago.\\" However, elders did find \\"bullying\\" and \\"patterns of persistent sinful behavior\\" by Driscoll. The board also concluded that Driscoll had \\"been guilty of arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner\\", but was not charged with anything immoral or illegal. Driscoll maintained that he had not disqualified himself from ministry. Church leadership crafted a \\"restoration\\" plan to help Driscoll and save the church. Instead, Driscoll declined the restoration plan and resigned on October 14, 2014, citing concerns for his health and safety. His resignation came as a \\"surprise\\" to the church's Board of Overseers, who said in a statement that they had not asked Driscoll for his resignation. The journalist Ruth Graham wrote that \\"there was no single disgrace or crime that brought Driscoll down. Instead, it was a series of accusations: of plagiarism, crudeness, a bullying management style, unseemly consolidation of power, and squishy book-promotion ethics, to name a few.\\" Theology professor Anthony Bradley remarked that while denominational churches have continuity after the departure of prominent leaders, Mars Hill Church was nondenominational and largely built on Driscoll's personal charisma. On October 20, 2014, Driscoll publicly stated that prior to his resignation, he and his family were harassed and he had received death threats.  The Trinity Church in Scottsdale, Arizona  thumb On July 27, 2015, Driscoll announced that his new ministry had purchased the mailing list and assets of The Resurgence from Mars Hill Church and that he and his family had moved to the Phoenix area. On February 1, 2016, Driscoll announced the opening of his new church: The Trinity Church in Scottsdale, Arizona. As of February 2016, the staff roster included two former Mars Hill employees. Texas megachurch pastors Robert Morris and Jimmy Evans were on the church's board.  Public image  According to the Seattle Times, \\"preaching and communicating lies at the heart of Driscoll's draw.\\" In another Seattle Times article, Driscoll is described as a \\"hipster preacher\\" who used \\"charisma and combativeness\\". Driscoll has been described as a \\"gifted orator\\" and \\"charismatic leader\\". People call him a very compelling speaker, \\"gifted\\" and \\"dynamic and funny, with a potent mix of reverence for Jesus and irreverence for everything else.\\" His public speaking style, he says, is influenced by stand-up comedians like Chris Rock. Crosscut.com described his presentation style as follows: Rob Wall, a professor at Seattle Pacific University, links the success of Mars Hill Church to Mark Driscoll's direct answers to complicated spiritual questions: \\"His style of public rhetoric is very authoritative. Whether it's about the Bible, or about culture, he is very clear and definitive.\\" In 2009, The New York Times Magazine called Driscoll \\"one of the most admired‚Äîand reviled‚Äîfigures among evangelicals nationwide.\\" In 2011, Preaching magazine named him one of the 25 most influential [English-speaking] pastors of the past 25 years. Driscoll is described in a 2014 profile by Salon as being the center of a cult of personality, and of using controversy to increase his visibility. Salon has also described talk fused with God talk, or titillation more broadly, [as] a key component of the Driscoll brand,\\" adding: \\"Driscoll's stage persona at times has included tight jeans and an extra button open on the shirt. He once greeted a crowd at the University of Washington by reporting that he had gotten his genitals caught in his zipper before the show and that he would be stopping on time because his wife was at home waiting for him with a cream pie.\\"  Controversy  See also: = Comments on Ted Haggard = When the evangelical pastor Ted Haggard resigned from church leadership after a sex scandal involving a male escort, Driscoll provoked an uproar by posting the following comment on his blog: \\"A wife who lets herself go and is not sexually available to her husband in the ways that the Song of Songs is so frank about is not responsible for her husband's sin, but she may not be helping him either.\\" Driscoll later apologized for his statement, stating that he did not intend for his comment to reflect on Haggard's wife personally. After the incident, the Seattle Times discontinued Driscoll as one of its religion columnists. = Rant from 2000 = On July 30, 2014, dissenters released a \\"controversial, vulgar\\" rant Driscoll had written under the pseudonym \\"William Wallace II\\" in 2000, dubbed the \\"Pussified Nation\\" rant. The rant contained \\"blunt and emotional comments critical of feminism, homosexual behavior, and 'sensitive emasculated' men\\", and called for \\"real men\\" to rise up in the spirit of Scottish warrior William Wallace as depicted in the film Braveheart. Mars Hill Church had long since deleted their unmoderated \\"Midrash\\" discussion board where the forum postings occurred. Driscoll referenced the incident in his 2006 book Confessions of a Reformission Rev; in that book, he stated that he believed his intentions were good, but regretted having written the rant. He wrote in 2006, \\"I had a good mission, but some of my tactics were born out of anger and burnout, and I did a lot of harm and damage while attracting a lot of attention.\\" Driscoll responded to the release of the rant in a letter to his congregation, writing that \\"the content of my postings to that discussion board does not reflect how I feel or how I would conduct myself today.\\" On September 8, 2014, blogger Libby Anne republished other examples of material written by \\"William Wallace II\\" in 2001, and remarked she had \\"rarely seen an evangelical man assert male superiority and prominence this directly.\\" = Accusations of plagiarism in A Call to Resurgence (2013) = On November 21, 2013, radio host Janet Mefferd accused Driscoll of plagiarism. Mefferd claimed that 14 pages of Driscoll's book A Call to Resurgence quoted \\"extensively and without citation\\" from Peter Jones's 1999 book, Gospel Truth/Pagan Lies: Can You Tell the Difference? and Jones's 2010 book One or Two: Seeing a World of Difference. Driscoll's publisher Tyndale House stated that they performed a \\"thorough in-house review\\" and disagreed that this was a case of plagiarism. Neil Holdway, a plagiarism expert with the American Copy Editors Society, concluded that \\"Driscoll had not adequately indicated the extent to which he had borrowed Jones's work.\\" More allegations of plagiarism in other Driscoll works soon surfaced, including passages from a sermon series companion text, Trial: 8 Witnesses From 1&2 Peter, which were copied verbatim from passages written by David Wheaton in the New Bible Commentary. InterVarsity Press, publisher of the New Bible Commentary, stated that Driscoll failed to properly provide quotation or attribution for the material. The relevant passages were posted online. The allegations soon expanded to include claims that Driscoll used ghostwriters and researchers without giving them proper attribution. As of December 2013, neither Peter Jones, D.A. Carson, nor Janet Mefferd had made any further statements pertaining the case. Syndicator Salem Radio subsequently removed both the broadcast interview with Driscoll and associated materials from Mefferd's program website and apologized for raising the matter in a broadcast interview. This attempt to shut down the story provoked the resignation of Mefferd's producer, Ingrid Schlueter. In explaining her resignation, Schlueter wrote the following regarding herself and Mefferd: Driscoll apologized for \\"mistakes\\" related to the allegations in a statement released to The Christian Post on December 18, 2013. = New York Times Bestseller List and Driscoll's Real Marriage (2014) = On March 5, 2014, evangelical magazine World published an article claiming that Mars Hill Church paid a $25,000 fee to marketing firm ResultSource, to manipulate sales numbers of Mark Driscoll's book Real Marriage and thereby attain a place on the New York Times bestseller list. ResultSource accomplished this objective‚Äîthe book briefly reached #1 in the \\"Advice How-to\\" category‚Äîby buying 11,000 copies of the book, using $210,000 of Mars Hill Church's money, from a variety of online sources and payment methods. The Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability stated that buying a place on bestseller lists violates its ethical standards, but that because this happened before Mars Hill Church joined they were unable to take action. Christianity Today described the arrangement as \\"ethically questionable\\", and Carl Trueman of religion journal First Things decried the revelation, writing, \\"the overall picture is one of disaster\\" and \\"[it] has raised questions not simply about personal integrity but also the very culture of American Evangelicalism.\\" Driscoll had used the apparent success of Real Marriage to negotiate a multi-book deal with Christian publisher Tyndale House. The first book under Driscoll's \\"Resurgence\\" imprint was A Call to Resurgence, with plans to publish five to seven books per year. Tyndale House defended Driscoll's alleged plagiarism in A Call to Resurgence, and affirmed their continuing relationship with Driscoll. Mars Hill Church responded with a statement, writing, \\"while not uncommon or illegal, this unwise strategy [of buying one's own books to drive up book sales figures] is not one we had used before or since, and not one we will use again.\\" Mars Hill also claimed that the \\"true cost\\" of the effort was less than \\"what has been reported.\\" On March 17, 2014, Driscoll posted an open letter of apology in response to this controversy and others, writing that he will no longer claim to be a New York Times bestselling author, and that he now sees the ResultSource marketing campaign as \\"manipulating a book sales reporting system, which is wrong.\\" He wrote that he was giving up his status as a \\"celebrity pastor\\", that he considered his \\"angry young prophet\\" days to be over, and that he was reducing his public presence in speaking engagements and on social media. = Planned appearance at Hillsong Conference 2015 = Driscoll was scheduled to appear at Hillsong Church's 2015 Australian and UK conferences. A petition against Driscoll's appearance at the conference collected 3000 signatures, prompting Hillsong Church Senior Pastor Brian Houston to cancel Driscoll's planned speaking event. Instead, the Hillsong conference presented a 30-minute taped interview of Mark and Grace Driscoll interviewed by Houston at the conference.  Beliefs  Jesus Saves cross outside The Trinity Church Driscoll is an evangelical Christian. Within that broad movement, he is theologically and socially conservative. On the Bible, he is a literalist and inerrantist. Driscoll's theology draws inspiration from historical theologians, including Augustine of Hippo, John Calvin, and Martin Luther, along with the Puritans, Jonathan Edwards, and Charles Spurgeon. He also respects evangelical leaders such as Billy Graham, J. I. Packer, Francis Schaeffer, and John Stott. His contemporary influences include Lesslie Newbigin and the group he terms the \\"Missional Reformed Evangelicals\\": Don Carson and John Piper for theology, and Tim Keller and Ed Stetzer for missiology. cited in Driscoll's combination of theological conservatism and his \\"missional\\" embrace of contemporary culture contribute to controversies. In his younger years, Molly Worthen wrote: \\"Conservatives call Driscoll 'the cussing pastor' and wish that he'd trade in his fashionably distressed jeans and taste for indie rock for a suit and tie and placid choral arrangements. Liberals wince at his hellfire theology and insistence that women submit to their husbands.\\" Regarding spiritual gifts, Driscoll is a continuationist. Regarding creation, he is a \\"Historic Creationist\\". In his book Doctrine: What Christians Should Believe, Driscoll expressed his respect for John Sailhamer's book Genesis Unbound; Driscoll is skeptical of evolution as a part of creationism. Driscoll believes that homosexual behavior is sinful and that marriage is between one man and one woman. Regarding ecclesiastical polity, Driscoll favors an elder-led approach. = Calvinism = Driscoll adheres to Reformed or Calvinist theology, although he characterizes his position specifically as new Calvinism to differentiate himself from the more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He thinks this position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: \\"Calvinism came after Calvin ... I will argue that the Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin ... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later\\". Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter. Driscoll distinguishes between double and single predestination, and says that unlike John Calvin, he believes only in single predestination. through the sermon he talks briefly about this. = Emerging church = Driscoll was associated with the emerging church movement. He described the movement as follows:. Cited in > The emerging church is a growing, loosely connected movement of primarily > young pastors who are glad to see the end of modernity and are seeking to > function as missionaries who bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to emerging > and postmodern cultures. The emerging church welcomes the tension of holding > in one closed hand the unchanging truth of evangelical Christian theology () > and holding in one open hand the many cultural ways of showing and speaking > Christian truth as a missionary to America (). Since the movement, if it can > be called that, is young and is still defining its theological center, I do > not want to portray the movement as ideologically unified because I myself > swim in the theologically conservative stream of the emerging church. Driscoll later distanced himself from the movement: > In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the emerging church and > spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the > emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the > Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the > emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug > Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples > include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and > knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the > cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one hell of a > mistake. = Gender roles = On gender roles, Driscoll is a complementarian, believing that men and women have equal worth, but have different roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church. According to a Mother Jones profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held egalitarian views at one time. He offered church courses in \\"evangelical feminism\\" and is quoted as saying \\"the Bible is clear that men and women are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way.\\" In 2003, Driscoll said that he wished he could change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors. Male leadership of the church is crucial, according to Driscoll, who believes that God called him specifically to \\"train men.\\" He traces many modern spiritual and social problems to the acceptance of female leadership. Driscoll describes Eve's temptation by the serpent in the Garden of Eden as \\"the first invitation to an independent feminism.\\" For Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was, according to Driscoll, \\"the first exercising of a woman's role in leadership in the home and in the church in the history of the world. It does not go well.\\" Driscoll believes that Christianity has been \\"feminized\\". In a 2006 interview with Desiring God, he said, \\"The problem with the church today, it's just a bunch of nice, soft, tender, 'chickified' [sic] church boys. Sixty percent of Christians are chicks, and the forty percent that are dudes are still sort of chicks. ... The whole architecture and the whole aesthetic [of church buildings and services] is really feminine.\\" In contrast, Driscoll emphasizes what he perceives as macho behavior in the actions of biblical protagonists: he describes Jesus, Paul the Apostle, and King David saying: \\"... these guys were dudes. Heterosexual, win-a-fight, punch-you-in-the-nose, dudes.\\" He believes that in order to be innovative, the church needs to get entrepreneurial young men involved, who will \\"make the culture of the future.\\" Driscoll interprets the Apostle Paul as writing that women are encouraged to be an active part of life and ministry in the church, but that only men can teach other men or become \\"elder-pastors\\" (the terms being synonymous). Since Paul's prohibition of female elder-pastors appeals to the Genesis creation story () for its rationale, Driscoll argues that the restriction is permanent and cannot be adjusted for changing culture. When the Episcopal Church elected Katharine Jefferts Schori as its first female Presiding Bishop, Driscoll wrote on his blog that \\"if Christian males do not man up soon, the Episcopalians may vote a fluffy baby bunny rabbit as their next bishop to lead God's men.\\" = Sexuality = According to Salon.com, \\"Driscoll has been a key advocate for candid conversations about sexuality among conservative Christians\\". In Christians Might Be Crazy, Driscoll defends marriage as being between a man and a woman saying \\"It is clear that Jesus saw the male-female marriage bond of Genesis 1-2 as the prototype for human sexual relationships. Anything outside those boundaries was off limits. Despite this strong evidence, supporters of homosexuality nevertheless often appeal to Jesus, claiming that 'Jesus never condemned homosexuality' or even 'He never mentioned homosexuality'. [...] Jesus was no coward when it came to speaking up in order to rattle conventional thinking and effect change. If He was silent, it was because He saw no need to challenge the position His listeners already held.\\" Mark and Grace Driscoll published their first book together, entitled Real Marriage: The Truth About Sex, Friendship, and Life Together, in January 2012. It includes a chapter entitled \\"Can We _?\\", discussing a biblical rationale for specific sexual acts that evangelical pastors are considered reluctant to discuss. Driscoll said that the book was written because \\"only two [Christian] books go into depth on sexuality ... a lot of Christian teaching about sex is answering questions of a previous generation.\\" The Driscolls and Mars Hill Church heavily promoted the book, taking interviews with The View, Fox & Friends, and Piers Morgan Tonight. The Daily Beast described the book as controversial, writing that \\"evangelicals of all stripes [were] outraged ... from conservatives shocked by the graphic sex descriptions to liberals who hate its degrading of women.\\" Christian author and blogger Rachel Held Evans wrote, \\"Grace [Driscoll] is often cast as the damaged and sinful wife who withholds sex from her deserving husband, Mark the hero who is justified in leaving his wife but instead comes along to rescue her.\\" Cited in: Sessions, David. (January 13, 2012). Driscoll responded to criticism in a post to CNN's Belief Blog, writing: \\"You try to write a book on marriage and sex with your wife and next thing you know there are a lot of ants crashing your picnic.\\" He wrote that he and Grace anticipated criticism \\"from all sides\\" but felt it would be worthwhile anyway, because \\"we want to help marriages and single people aspiring to marry. ...\\" In a 2007 sermon he preached in Edinburgh, Scotland, Driscoll asserted that Song of Solomon 2:3 refers to oral intercourse and added, \\"'Men, I am glad to report to you that oral sex is biblical. ... The wife performing oral sex on the husband is biblical ... Ladies, your husbands appreciate oral sex. They do. So, serve them, love them well'\\". During the same sermon, Driscoll stated that he had once advised a woman that she ought to perform oral sex upon her husband, and to apologize for her past unwillingness to do so; Driscoll added that later, the woman's husband was influenced to become a Christian because she had followed this advice.

Baby on board sign The intention of the sign is often confused with a warning to emergency personnel in case of emergency, as there may be a baby in the vehicle. However, this is historically inaccurate. History and popular use A version of the sign was found in Germany by Patricia Bradley of Medford, Massachusetts. With her sister Helen she started a company, PHOB, to market them in the US, but had only limited success until partnering with Michael Lerner. Lerner was told about the signs after recounting his experience of aggressive drivers when driving his baby nephew home in busy traffic. An urban legend claims that the death of a baby led to the creation of the signs, but there is no truth to this claim. Lerner eventually bought PHOB for approximately US$150,000, and changed the name to Safety 1st. The company later diversified into infant and child care products. The sign became a ubiquitous fad, flourishing in 1985. Its use in the US rapidly declined in 1986 as parody imitations with lines like \\"Baby I'm Bored\\", \\"Pit Bull on board\\", and \\"Mother-In-Law in Trunk\\" became popular, although its popularity continues in the United Kingdom (along with other versions such as \\"Princess on board\\" and \\"Little Person on board\\"), in Italy and in Japan (usually saying \\"Baby in Car\\", with the sign written in either English or Japanese script) well into the 21st century. Despite waning in popularity, the signs have entered the American lexicon. In 1993, The Simpsons episode \\"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\\" featured a barbershop quartet tune called \\"Baby on Board\\". The song was written by Homer Simpson in a flashback to 1985 when Marge bought a sign, hoping it would stop people from \\"intentionally ramming our car\\". Following popular request and trials in 2005, Transport for London (TfL) began issuing badges with the TfL logo and the words \\"Baby on board!\\" to pregnant women travelling on the London Underground, to help other passengers identify pregnant commuters who would like to be offered a seat.

He is also the lead guitarist, backing vocalist, as well one of the founding members of the post- hardcore band Alexisonfire. MacNeil has featured as a guest vocalist for songs by various other artists, including \\"St. Andrews\\" by Bedouin Soundclash, \\"Deathsmarch\\" by Cancer Bats (also appearing in the song's video), \\"Widower\\" by Johnny Truant, \\"The Gre(A)t Depression\\" by Anti-Flag and \\"She Upon the Black Wolf\\" by The Banner. MacNeil was also the weekend afternoon announcer on CFNY-FM (102.1 the Edge) Toronto from November 2014 to August 2018. Music career =With Alexisonfire= MacNeil co-founded Alexisonfire in the fall of 2001 after being phoned by Dallas Green, who asked for MacNeil's assistance in getting Green's band at the time, Helicon Blue, some shows in the area. MacNeil, having just left the band \\"After the Hallowed Moment\\", had been jamming with drummer Jesse Ingelevics, and asked Green if he wanted to start a band with him. Green accepted, and the 3 jammed together, with both MacNeil and Green on guitar and vocals, which was later cited as the first Alexisonfire practice together. Chris Steele, who was an active member alongside MacNeil in the bands \\"Plan 9\\" and \\"After the Hallowed Moment\\", assumed the role of bass player. MacNeil recruited George Pettit, after having seen him perform as the bassist in the metal band Condemning Salem, a band which Pettit expressed great discontent in playing in. =With Gallows= Frank Carter the original vocalist of UK hardcore band Gallows announced in early July 2011 that he would be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on August 1 after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the August 9, 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of coincidence that Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. The band completed a debut release with Wade, Death Is Birth, a four track extended play which was released on December 13 of that year. The ep was sold as a 7\\" vinyl record. A music video for True Colours was released and Mondo Chaos was released in a single format. Gallows have announced the release date of their eponymous third album to be September 10, 2012. The album was produced, mixed and mastered by Spycatcher members Thomas Mitchener and Steve Sears at Watford's Broadfields Studio and will be released via the band's new label Venn Records in partnership with PIAS Recordings. The album will also be released and distributed in the United States through Bridge Nine Records. It is the first Gallows full-length to feature MacNeil on lead vocals and the second official release overall after 2011's Death Is Birth EP. =In film= Wade is credited as a composer for Goon: Last of the Enforcers. After attending a Habs game with Jay Baruchel, Wade created songs for the film, that he describes as \\"to be all things that sound like you could turn up to 10 in an arena.\\" In 2018, Wade partnered with Andrew Gordon Macpherson to create the score for the film \\"The Ranger\\". =In video games= Wade again partnered with Andrew Gordon Macpherson in 2018 to create the soundtrack to Far Cry 5's arcade mode.

It is a type of fractional crystallization. The process generally involves taking a mixture of substances, dissolving them in warm water, and then rapidly cooling the mixture. The insoluble compounds precipitate out of the water, while the soluble ones stay dissolved. The solution can then be separated by filtration or decantation. This process works by exploiting the differences in solubility of different substances in a low temperature mixture. Opiates are much more soluble in cold water than acetaminophen. It is used to separate out opiate drugs that have been mixed with common non-opiate analgesics. Cold water extraction is often used with codeine/paracetamol, hydrocodone/paracetamol and oxycodone/paracetamol medications. Items needed The cold water extraction process is fairly simple not only due to the simplicity of the method but also because the items needed are minimal and can all be found in a common household. The items used in the process are usually 2 drinking glasses (or any other container), a screen (used to filter) and an item capable of crushing the tablets (mortar and pestle for example). The recommended screen to use is a simple coffee filter due to its high effectiveness when compared to other screens such as a piece of cloth or folded napkin.

Together they worked on a strip for a short lived British magazine called Heartbreak Hotel. After this, Fegredo worked at Crisis for Fleetway before working on Kid Eternity at DC Comics with writer Grant Morrison.

Fegredo's six-issue miniseries, Hellboy: Darkness Calls, was the first Hellboy miniseries that did not feature Hellboy creator Mike Mignola on art (Mignola plotted the book). Fegredo went on to do the art for the short story Hellboy: The Mole, the eight-issue miniseries Hellboy: The Wild Hunt, and the miniseries The Storm and The Fury (both three issues).

Cat Ba island has a surface area of 285 km2 (110 sq mi) and maintains the dramatic and rugged features of Ha Long Bay.  History of Cat Ba Island  Cat Ba \\" Historical name called Cac Ba \\" Island means \\"Women‚Äôs Island\\" (Cac meaning all and Ba meaning women). Legend has it that many centuries ago, three women of the Tran Dynasty were killed and their bodies floated all the way to Cat Ba Island. Each body washed up on a different beach and all three were found by local fishermen. The residents of Cat Ba built a temple for each woman, and the island soon became known as Cat Ba. Archaeological evidence suggests that people have lived on Cat Ba Island for almost 6,000 years, with the earliest settlements being found on the southeastern tip of the Island close to the area where Ban Beo harbour sits today. In 1938, a group of French archaeologists discovered human remains belonging \\"to the Cai Beo people of the Ha Long culture, which lived between 4,000 and 6,500 years ago‚Ä¶ considered to be perhaps the first population group occupying the northeastern territorial waters of Vietnam‚Ä¶ [and] the Cai Beo people may be an intermediary link between the population strata at the end of the Neolithic Age, some 4,000 years ago.\\" Cave Hospital In more recent history, Cat Ba Island was inhabited mostly by Viet-Chinese fisherman and was largely influenced by both the French and American wars. The island was a strategic look-out point and bombing during the wars often forced local residents to hide among the Island's many caves. Today, the best reminders of the two wars have been turned into tourist attractions. Hospital Cave, which was a secret, bomb-proof hospital during the American War and as a safe house for VC leaders. This three-storey feat of engineering was in use until 1975 is only 10 km north of Cat Ba town. The second attraction, the newly built Cannon Fort, sits on a peak 177 meters high, offering visitors a chance to see old bunkers and helicopter landing stations as well as views of Cat Ba Island, its coast, and the limestone karsts in Lan Ha Bay offshore. In 1979, the third Indo-China War broke out between China and Vietnam in response to Vietnam‚Äôs invasion of Cambodia that ended the reign of the Khmer Rouge. Relations between China and Vietnam collapsed, leading to the Vietnamese government evicting around 30,000 ‚Ä¶ of the fishermen, and most of the rest of the Chinese community from the greater Ha Long area. Cat Ba town, showing the limestone hills behind the waterfront strip  Tourism  Today, increases in infrastructure on the Island (including the building of bigger roads, dams to build harbors and to protect Cat Ba town from flooding, consistent electricity being brought to the island (which surprisingly happened as late as 1997) instead of having to rely on a generator, and large ferries and barges, able to transport trucks and cars to the Island from the mainland making daily trips to Cat Ba) made it easier for tourists to visit the Island, leading to a rapid increase in tourism and development in Cat Ba town starting in 2001. Since then, a stop on Cat Ba Island has been included in the itinerary of many Ha Long Bay cruises and a strip of tall, thin, five-storey budget hotels line the seafront, receiving more than 350,000 visitors a year. Currently, over 150 hotels are listed in Cat Ba Island‚Äôs tourist directory pamphlet, from cheap budget hotels to flashier upscale resorts, and construction is underway on many more. Right now, construction is under way on the colossal Cat Ba Amatina, an enormous project that will transform the southern coast of the island. The Amatina compound will be \\"a world-class integrated marina, casino, resort and theme park\\" spanning 171.57 hectares and (VITC) will be able to host almost 6,000 residents at a time. The Amatina will boast \\"seven resorts with over 800 villas, three marinas, one international convention palace, six five-star hotels and one four-star hotel\\" (VITC). The scale of this project is gigantic and will basically create a luxurious mini-city on Cat Ba and will attract tourists from around the world. Cat Ba Island has become the adventure-tourism capital of Vietnam, and many of the activities advertised are nature-based. Visitors can kayak and take boat cruises through Ha Long Bay and the Cat Ba Archipelago, hike through the national park, mountain bike around the Island, spend time hiking and swimming on Monkey Island just offshore, tourist can stay at Monkey Island Resort for real relax time on private beach, explore the Island's many caves, swim on Cat Co 1, 2, or 3 (three sandy beaches a short walk from Cat Ba town), or even go rock climbing and deep water soloing on the limestone karsts in Lan Ha Bay. With so many things to do, Cat Ba Island is slowly gaining popularity as an alternative to the crowded Ha Long Bay Town.https://theobriensabroad.com/vietnam/halong-bay- alternative-cat-ba-island/ With its scenery, its association with Ha Long Bay, its proximity to cities like Haiphong (50 km) and Hanoi (150 km), and even China (many regional visitors come to the Island in the summer, the busy season, to avoid the heat and pollution in the cities), and plenty to do, Cat Ba Island has become a major travel destination for foreign and Vietnamese visitors alike.  Cat Ba National Park  At the heart of Cat Ba Island lies an ecologically diverse national park. In 1986, 9,800 [98 km¬≤] hectares (approximately one-third of the Island's total land mass) was annexed as Cat Ba National Park, the first decreed protected area in Vietnam to include a marine component (Dawkins 14). It had previously been the site of a timber company. In 2006, the boundaries of the national park were redefined, so the park contained 109 km¬≤ of land area and an additional 52 km¬≤ of inshore waters and mangrove-covered tidal zones (langur website). The park is staffed by 92 people, including over 60 park rangers. View from Ngu Lam Peak, Cat Ba National Park In 2004, Cat Ba Archipelago was declared a UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve Area in order to protect the multiple terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as well the diverse plant and animal life that is found on the Island. The UNESCO designation divides the archipelago into three distinct areas, each with certain functions and restrictions that regulate development and conservation measures on the Island: = Core Area = The core area needs to be legally established and is not subject to human activity, except research and monitoring, and as the case may be, to traditional extractive uses by local communities. Cat Ba National Park more or less constitutes the core zone of the Cat Ba Archipelago Biosphere Reserve. (8,500 hectares, of which 2,000 are marine) = Buffer Zone = The buffer zone must surround or be contiguous to the core area. Activities are organized here so that they do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area but rather help to protect it. It can be an area for experimental research and it may accommodate education, tourism, and recreational facilities. (7,741 hectares, of which 2,800 are marine) = Outer Transitional Area = To provide support for research, monitoring, education, and information exchange related to local, national, and global issues of conservation and development. (10,000 hectares, of which 4,400 are marine) = Goals of the National Park = The first purpose is conservation, and the park is primarily committed to protecting the nature and wildlife in the archipelago. The second purpose is scientific research, and the third purpose is to promote eco-tourism and environmental education. A third priority is to increase the economic development of the small communities living in the buffer zones of the national park through eco- tourism and conservation programs, that balance both conservation and economic goals. = Biodiversity = Besides its natural environment, the park is home to a high number of species. There are 1,561 recorded species of flora found in the park, from 186 families, including 406 species of wooden trees, 661 medicinal plants, and 196 edible plants. The fauna on the island consists of 279 species, including 53 mammal species from 18 families, and 23 Endangered and Critically Endangered species. There are 160 bird species, 66 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 274 species of insects from 79 different families. Aquatically, there are 900 sea fish, 178 species of coral, 7 species of sea snakes, 4 species of sea turtles, and 21 species of seaweed found throughout the archipelago. = The Cat Ba Langur = The Cat Ba langur (Trachypithecus poliocephalus), or white-headed langur, is endemic to Cat Ba Island and is one of the most endangered primates in the world. The langurs' population numbers, which used to be between 2,400-2,700, dwindled to as low as only 53 langurs in 2000 due to poaching for traditional medicine and habitat fragmentation caused by human development. Today, there are approximately 68 langurs left in the wild. The langur population and its habitat is monitored by the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project (CBLCP), a German-based NGO that works in close cooperation with the national park staff and the local governments on Cat Ba Island and in Hai Phong province, especially the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Hai Phong, to protect the langur, its habitat, and to help conserve the biodiversity and environmental integrity of the entire Cat Ba Archipelago. difficulties the project has faced in the past and will face going forward. The CBLCP is an in situ conservation project, meaning the project works to protect both the animal and its habitat (there are no plans to put the langurs in zoos). This means that by taking efforts to preserve the langurs, the CBLCP, by protecting the natural environment of the archipelago, really works to preserve all the species found on the archipelago and to protect the overall health of the forest. The biggest reason for the steep decline in langur population numbers was illegal poaching and trapping of the langurs for traditional medicinal purposes. This is a difficult trend to reverse, as the langur was being poached by local people who relied on the forest for subsistence and sold langurs to support their meagre income, and from poachers outside the Island who are part of the international illegal wildlife trade. Another major threat facing the langurs is habitat fractionalization, due to increases in human development. Currently, the langur population is fragmented into seven isolated sub-populations at five different locations on Cat Ba Island, with most of the langur groups being very small in number with some populations longer functional in terms of reproduction (only three groups are currently reproducing). The fragmentation of the langur population reduces genetic variability, which is already a major problem due to the minute population numbers and makes it impossible for some groups of langurs to reproduce and replace aging group members. To fight this problem, the CBLCP focused their efforts on two approaches: increasing education and awareness levels about the decline of the langur population and other conservation issues and creating a protection network that relies on the local population. These two approaches both take great effort and care to engage the residents of Cat Ba Island, which makes the programs more effective. The CBLCP also takes an active approach in raising levels of environmental awareness and education on Cat Ba Island; they also strive to create a connection between the citizens of Cat Ba Island and the natural environment. Other mammals in the Park include civet cats and oriental giant squirrels. 300px  Environmental Problems  Cat Ba Island faces numerous environmental problems. Increases in tourism and recent developments threaten the ecological integrity and biodiversity of the island, reducing and fragmenting the natural habitat for Cat Ba's numerous species. Illegal hunting and poaching, overfishing, and water pollution in Ha Long Bay continue to threaten the ecological health of the island. Many tour operators include an option of trekking in the National Park or canoeing on three-day tours; shorter tours generally only stay overnight in the small town of Cat Ba (population about 8,000) or on boats moored in Cai Beo bay, about 2 km away from Cat Ba town. Cat Ba itself is attractively situated around a bay teeming with small boats, many of which belong to pearl or shrimp farmers, and can become very busy at weekends and during public holidays. The promenade has illuminations and a large fountain which only plays after dark; it is backed by a strip of cheap hotels and bars, but dominated by the wooded limestone hills behind. The island is a national park of Vietnam and was recognized by UNESCO in December 2004 as a Biosphere reserve of the world. Hai Phong's people committee, as well as the Vietnam Government, have cooperated with many organizations and educate local citizens to help protect the environment.

The statuette usually consists of a crude male figurine carved out of wood, partially hidden inside a round wooden barrel. When the barrel is taken off, the male figure inside is revealed, sporting a prominent phallic protrusion in the lower part of the figure's anatomy. The souvenir is fairly common in gift shops in the Philippines and is somewhat popular among tourists who may be surprised the first time they encounter the object and lift its barrel. The barrel man has also been identified as a part of Philippine culture and art, often as the subject of Filipino jokes. In 2005, the Filipino American Network sponsored an exhibit called \\"Beyond the Barrelman\\" in Chicago. The event showcased artworks of Filipino artists from North America and the Philippines.

Barrelman is in reference to a person who would be stationed in the barrel of the foremast or crow's nest of an oceangoing vessel as a navigational aid. In early ships the crow's nest was simply a barrel or a basket lashed to the tallest mast. Later it became a specially designed platform with protective railing.  History  According to a popular naval legend, the term derives from the practice of Viking sailors, who carried crows or ravens in a cage secured to the top of the mast. In cases of poor visibility, a crow was released, and the navigator plotted a course corresponding to the bird's flight path because the crow invariably headed towards the nearest land.navy.mil Some naval scholars have found no evidence of the masthead crow cage and suggest the name was coined simply because the lookout platform resembled a crow's nest in a tree.Joan Druett, \\"Crows Nest\\", World of the Written World, February 13, 2011 As ships grew in size and complexity, that station came to be mounted on the highest mast of the oceangoing vessel, and it came to be known as the crow's nest.Naval Terms The simplest construction to providing a lookout and setting course direction for the ship was to lash a barrel to the mast. A member of the crew experienced in the matters of navigation was charged with manning this perch and came to be colloquially known as a barrelman.

He became world famous when he took on the role of devil child Damien Thorn in the 1976 film The Omen, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Male. Biography Stephens was born in Putney, London and was educated at Malory college School (currently Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy), Bromley. He was four years old when picked for the part, which required him to have his blond hair dyed dark brown. In an interview with AMC, director Richard Donner said Stephens got the part after attacking the filmmaker (at Donner's urging), punching Donner in the testicles for good measure. It was the only major film role in Stephens' career; he would later play a small role in the 1980 TV film Gauguin the Savage. He also appears in the DVD special features section of the 2006 version of The Omen, and as a tabloid journalist in the film. Interview footage of Stephens from 1996 was used in the 2005 documentary The Curse of the Omen, a programme detailing the supposed eerie coincidences surrounding the making of the film. Stephens appeared on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio on 23 April 2008 to promote a film he was working on. He said he also has started appearing at autograph signings and horror conventions \\"with my tricycle.\\" =Arrest= On 13 January 2017, Stephens was given a suspended prison sentence for a road-rage attack on two cyclists at Toys Hill, Westerham, Kent, on 21 August 2016. The court had heard that Stephens repeatedly used his horn when riders Mark Richardson and Alex Manley, who were out cycling separately, were side-by-side on the road as one overtook the other. Richardson responded by flicking his middle finger at Stephens, who then pulled over. After getting out of his car, Stephens punched Richardson, knocking him unconscious, which prompted Manley to intervene. Stephens responded by asking Manley: ‚ÄúYou want some do you?‚Äù before punching him twice in the face, causing him to fall on his back with his bicycle still between his legs. Stephens then held him down and punched him six or seven times, inflicting dental injuries and damaging his helmet. In 2017, at Maidstone Crown Court, Judge Martin Joy sentenced Stephens to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years, for causing actual bodily harm, and to two months, also suspended for two years, for criminal damage. Stephens, a resident of the High Street, Edenbridge, Kent, was ordered to undergo rehabilitation, perform 150 hours of unpaid work, pay compensation of ¬£1,000 to each victim, and an extra ¬£120 to Mr Manley for his damaged helmet.Omen star Harvey Spencer Stephens sentenced for road rage attack, bbc.co.uk; accessed 2 March 2018.\\"Actor who played 'The Omen''s Damien sentenced on Friday 13th for road rage\\", theguardian.com, 13 January 2017; accessed 2 March 2018.

Among the Plains Indians of North America, counting coup involved the winning of prestige against an enemy. Native American warriors won prestige by acts of bravery in the face of the enemy, which could be recorded in various ways and retold as stories. Any blow struck against the enemy counted as a coup, but the most prestigious acts included touching an enemy warrior with a hand, bow, or coup stick and escaping unharmed.Plenty Coups and Linderman, Plenty-Coups, Chief of the Crows, 2002, p. 31.\\"Counting Coup.

Encyclopedia of the Great Plains Indians. University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, 2011. Escaping unharmed while counting coup was considered a higher honor than being wounded in the attempt. After a battle or exploit, the people of a band would gather together to recount their acts of bravery and \\"count coup\\". Coups were recorded by putting notches in a coup stick. Indians of the Pacific Northwest would tie an eagle feather to their coup stick for each coup counted, but many nations did not do so. Among the Blackfoot nation of the upper Missouri River Valley, coup could be recorded by the placement of \\"coup bars\\" on the sleeves and shoulders of special shirts that bore paintings of the warrior's exploits in battle. Many shirts of this sort have survived to the present, including some in European museums.Brownstone, Arni. \\"The Mus√©e de l'Homme's Foureau Robe and Its Moment in the History of Blackfoot Painting\\". Plains Anthropologist 46.177 (2001): 249‚Äì267: 255. . In some tribes, a warrior who won coup was permitted to wear an eagle feather in his hair, and if wounded in the attempt, he was required to paint the feather red to indicate this. Joe Medicine Crow (1913‚Äì2016) is credited with achieving the feat while serving with the US Army during World War II, as on one occasion he overpowered and disarmed a German soldier, and later stole horses from an SS unit.

This differs from distribution-style cable, in which tight-buffered fibers are bundled together, with only the outer cable jacket of the cable protecting them. The design of breakout-style cable adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the cable is larger and more expensive than distribution-style cable. Breakout cable is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple cable run is planned to avoid the use of any splicebox or spliced fiber pigtails. Because each fiber is individually reinforced, the cable can be easily divided into individual fiber lines. Each simplex cable within the outer jacket may be broken out and then continue as a patch cable, for example in a fiber to the desk application in an office building. This enables connector termination without requiring special junctions, and can reduce or eliminate the need for fiberoptic patch panels or an optical distribution frame. Breakout cable requires terminations to be done with simple connectors, which may be preferred for some situations. A more common solution today is the use of a fanout kit that adds a jacket to the very fine strands of other cable types.

It is located in the Jebel Riha, approximately 65 km north from Hama and 80 km southwest from Aleppo, very close to ruins of another \\"dead city\\" of Bara. The settlement arose in a natural basin and prospered from cultivating of grapes and olives. A bath complex indicates the wealth of the community. Unusually, it was built in 473, already during the time of Christianity. Thomas Joseph Shanan considered Serjilla as \\"Christian Pompeii\\". Charles-Jean-Melchior de Vog√º√©, a French archaeologist, did the first scientific studies in 1860s. In 1899, an archeological team from Princeton University discovered a large mosaic on the main hall floor, but it had disappeared when the team returned six years later. Traces of now destroyed murals were found on the walls as well. Next to the baths stands an andron, a meeting place for men. Further east, there was a small church but not much remains of it. Among ruins of numerous residential houses, a two storey villa which still stands today. In two lower rooms, one can still see an arch which would have supported the ceiling. This feature was typical in the Dead Cities. Behind the villa, there is a sunken building with an olive press. In Serjilla, the limestone-mining was very common and mature, even the empty space left by mining activities were useful, sometimes minings could take place right under the buildings.

Emerson (born March 7, 1955) is an American custom knifemaker, martial artist, and edged-weapons expert. Originally an engineer and machinist in the aerospace industry, Emerson became a knifemaker by producing knives for a martial arts class and making art knives early in his knifemaking career. In the 1980s he became better known for his combat knives and popularizing a style of knife known as the Tactical-folder. In order to secure military contracts, Emerson eventually founded Emerson Knives, Inc a production company to mass-produce his designs in 1996. Emerson's knives have been displayed as museum pieces, designed for use by Navy SEALs and used by NASA in outer space. Emerson's knives have been featured in films and novels, due to their association with military units. This has furthered their popularity with collectors. Emerson is an accomplished martial artist who has developed a combatives system, Emerson Combat Systems, which has been taught to police officers, military units, and civilians. Background Ernest Emerson was born on March 7, 1955 in northern Wisconsin. While attending high school he displayed athletic ability as a wrestler and baseball player, being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals to play professional baseball at the age of 17 in the Midwest League. Emerson began his training in martial arts at the age of 16 with the Korean version of Judo known as Yudo, traveling from Wisconsin to Minnesota twice a week to attend school. He continued his study of the martial arts while attending the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse where he earned a brown belt in Kyokushinkai Karate and a black belt in Shotokan Karate while competing on the university's karate team. After graduating with degrees in physical education and world history, Emerson moved to Southern California for the sole purpose of continuing his martial arts training at the Filipino Kali Academy. There he studied Jun Fan Gung Fu, Jeet Kune Do, and Eskrima under the tutelage of Dan Inosanto and Richard Bustillo (both prot√©g√©s of the late Bruce Lee). Emerson subsequently trained in Gracie Jiu Jitsu for three years at the original Gracie Academy in Torrance, California, under the founders of the Gracie Jiu Jitsu system, Rorion and Royce Gracie. Eventually, Emerson became an instructor in his own right and combined the principles of all these systems. It was in Southern California where he met his wife, Mary, who at the time was one of the world's top female practitioners of Jujutsu. During this time, Emerson worked as a technician, a machine operator, and eventually a design engineer for Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo. Early knifemaking Emerson's first handmade balisong knife Although Emerson credits his grandfather's gift of a Barlow knife to him at the age of eight years with starting his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch. When he started classes with this \\"homemade\\" knife, his instructors and fellow students were impressed with his handiwork and asked him to make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided he was going to make folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, \\"Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular\\". Pre-tactical models Pre-Tac Folders Emerson's early folding knives were of the linerlock variety, ground by the stock removal method, and utilized rare materials from the aerospace industry, including titanium, carbon fiber, micarta, and meteorite. He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time, including mother-of-pearl, abalone shell, paua shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods. Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker. The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades. Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the \\"Pre-Tac\\" (Pre-Tactical) models. They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades. The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms. Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson. Emerson's first logo or stamp on these knives was \\"Emerson Knives\\" surrounding the outline of a Bowie knife; accordingly this is referred to as the rare \\"Bowie Logo\\", appearing on only a very small number of knives. When a knife collector asked Emerson if he made Bowie knives, Emerson informed him that he did not. The collector then advised him to change his logo or he might confuse the knife-buying public, as they would ask for Bowie knives instead of linerlock folders. Emerson agreed with this assessment, dropping the knife outline and the word \\"knives\\" from his stamp, using just his name in a half-circle on the blade as a logo. This marking is known among collectors as the \\"Half-Moon Logo\\" and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives. These early knives sold for between $800 and $2,000 each; that, combined with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and credibility as a custom knifemaker. Once established as a serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make‚Äîknives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat. Viper Knives Viper Knives: MV-5, MV-3, and MV-1 As a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. Emerson ground the blades of these knives from ATS-34 steel with a Rockwell hardness of 57‚Äì59 and made them thicker toward the tip, creating a stronger- tipped blade than he had made previously. He bead-blasted the blades as he did the liners and bolsters instead of rubbing or polishing them, giving them a matte finish as opposed to the mirror-polished finish common on his earlier knives and other knives at the time. Emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose. The slender Viper 1 and smaller Viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer's backup weapon. The Viper 5 was designed to be used by naval boat crews, as the handle was contoured with a rear brake so as to not slip from the user's hand when wet and the Viper 3 was designed as a pure fighting knife with its 4-inch blade. Emerson's goal for this Viper line was to produce a working knife which would be more resistant to the elements and more durable than the \\"art knives\\" for which he had become known. These knives were created to satisfy the demand for a practical field-grade combat knife which could be carried discreetly and accessed quickly. He sold these five models under the name \\"Viper Knives\\" and changed the logo on the blades to read the same. Emerson makes these models on a custom basis under the names MV1‚Äì5, \\"MV\\" standing for \\"Model Viper\\". Specwar Knives Five variants of the CQC-6; the top knife is a Super Sized version and with the knife below features the Wave. In 1986 individual Navy SEALs from a West Coast team had been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and are known for their distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson. According to the SEALs' requirements, the knife had to be corrosion resistant, designed for easy cleaning in the field, durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool, and capable as a weapon should the need arise. Emerson's folding chisel-ground \\"tant≈ç\\" became the sixth model in his Viper series and, while a handful of prototypes were referred to as \\"Viper 6\\", the model was soon named the \\"CQC-6\\" (CQC refers to close-quarters combat) and was chosen by the SEALs for use. Ownership of a CQC-6 soon became something of a status symbol among members of various elite military units, including Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, German GSG 9, and British SAS. Because of this connection to the Special Warfare community, Emerson changed the name of his custom knife line to \\"Specwar Knives\\", and in 1990 this new designation began appearing in the logo on his blades. Other models followed in the Specwar line bearing the CQC Series moniker, including the CQC-7 which is another chisel-ground tant≈ç- bladed folder similar to the CQC-6 but with a saber-type handle shape. The CQC-8 (\\"Banana Knife\\") was a folder inspired by Bob Taylor's Warrior knife and William F. Moran's ST-23 is used by British SAS troops. The knife has the distinction of being the first folding knife that was designed to be ergonomically correct in both forward and reverse grip. Its users refer to it as \\"the finest fighting knife ever developed\\". The CQC-9 (\\"Eagle Knife\\") is a reverse-curved hawkbill blade developed as a backup weapon for an American law enforcement agency; it has an opening hole in the blade licensed from knife manufacturer Spyderco. Although Emerson has standard models for these custom knives which progress in order to CQC16, each one is made individually by hand. Popularizing the tactical knife Emerson-Neeley Timberline SPECWAR While not the first knifemaker to build what is known as a tactical folding knife, Emerson was one of several makers who popularized the concept of the handmade tactical folder in the 1980s. Emerson's knives began appearing in the Rogue Warrior series of novels written by the founder of the US Navy's SEAL Team Six, Richard Marcinko, at this time which helped fuel interest among collectors. This surge in interest for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming. Although he had been making knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later. As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, he realized that the demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies. Emerson's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for his SPECWAR model. According to Stephen Dick, the editor of Tactical Knives, this collaboration was a result of \\"the Navy deciding that only commercial designs would be considered due to failure of a previous custom knifemaker to deliver enough models to satisfy the need\\". This model featured a one-side chisel-ground tant≈ç blade almost 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick. Its handle was made from fiberglass-reinforced nylon molded around a near-full tang. Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath. The knife was originally a custom piece designed for Naval Special Warfare Group One, and this factory version was soon entered in the trials for the Navy SEALs knife in 1995. Although it was not chosen by the Navy, Stephen Dick reported that a number of members of SEAL Team One privately purchased the knife and were disappointed it was not made the official blade. The Emerson-Neeley SPECWAR knife won Blade Magazines 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award at the magazine's Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, and that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City from May 24 to August 15, 1995. Emerson's custom CQC-6 alongside Benchmade's 970 (CQC-7) In 1994 the president of Benchmade Knives, Les DeAsis, approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC-6 on a larger scale as a factory production model. Preferring to keep the CQC-6 as a custom-only knife, Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his, the CQC-7. The Benchmade factory version was sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 depending on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially serrated blade. The knife retained the profile of Emerson's custom piece in addition to the ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position. Despite these changes the knife was true to Emerson's original design, and even though it did not have the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with their own version of Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait. Emerson Knives, Inc. \\"First folding tanto with liner lock and G-10\\" -Emerson. In February 1996, Emerson and his wife, Mary, founded Emerson Knives, Inc. (abbreviated as EKI) in Torrance, California to manufacture knives on a larger scale than he was then capable of. This new company would be a distinct entity from his Specwar custom knives, although several custom designs would make their way into the production lineup. Four years after starting this venture, Emerson sold an entire year's worth of production in four hours at the SHOT (Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade) Show in January 2000. Emerson continued to collaborate with other companies on knife-related projects as his own company grew. In some cases these collaborators had become his competition, such as Gerber Knives. In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies' first automatic opening knife, the Gerber-Emerson Alliance. In that same year, Emerson collaborated with SureFire Flashlights by making an exclusive CQC-8 (Banana Knife) numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson-marked Centurion C2 CombatLight. In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco, the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company, to produce the CQC-T Tomahawk. This tomahawk features a curved head machined from 4140 steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle. Although not made by Emerson, the tomahawk was designed by him. In 2007, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom knifemaker and knife thrower Bobby Branton. The collaboration piece is a fixed-blade knife designed primarily for knife throwing dubbed the BETT: Branton-Emerson Tactical Thrower. \\"CQC-6 is the most collectible knife in the world\\" -Emerson Emerson Commander One of Emerson's earliest production models, the Commander (winner of Blade Magazines Overall Knife of the Year Award for 1999), is a large recurve folding knife based on a special custom design, the ES1-M, that he had made for a West Coast Navy SEAL Team. The Commander has a hook on the spine of the blade (originally designed as a blade catcher) which, when snagged on the edge of the pocket or sheath, causes the knife blade to open as it is drawn. Due to its visual aesthetic, Emerson called this innovation the \\"Wave\\"and secured a patent for it in 1998. Since another knife and tool company, Leatherman, had trademarked the name \\"Wave,\\" in March 1999 Emerson changed its name to the \\"wave-shaped opening feature\\". Emerson's Wave made its way onto most of the knives in both the production and custom lines, with the exception of the Viper models. It is a required feature on all knives that Emerson supplies to military units, search and rescue units, and law enforcement agencies. Emerson SARK After a disastrous helicopter crash in 1999 resulting in the deaths of six Marines and one sailor, the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife. The KA-BAR knives issued to the SBUs (Special Boat Units) had catastrophically failed to cut the Marines free from their webbing. The Navy went to Emerson, who designed and fabricated a working prototype within 24 hours. They found that it met their needs, and the model was dubbed the \\"SARK\\" (Search and Rescue Knife). The SARK is a folding knife with a wharncliffe-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them. The knife features Emerson's Wave. Seeing another need in the police community, Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the \\"P-SARK\\", or Police Search And Rescue Knife. In 2005, the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a guthook on the back of the blade for use as a line-cutter. Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the NSAR (Navy Search And Rescue) Knife. Emerson NASA Knife In 1999, NASA contracted Emerson to build a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline with the addition of a guthook cut into the tant≈ç point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA. On July 1, 2000, Emerson announced his semi-retirement from custom knifemaking in order to concentrate on this new production company and to fill the thousands of outstanding orders for his custom work. He still makes custom knives available for sale at knife shows, but takes no orders for new custom work. Since 1995 the only way to get a new custom knife from Emerson himself is through a lottery held at knife shows where he is present. Depending on the size of the show, as many as several hundred potential buyers write their names on individual pieces of paper at his booth, and at a predetermined time a name is drawn. The winner gets a chance to buy one of the custom knives brought to the show. In 2007, Emerson branched out in a new direction, announcing he would manufacture twelve custom electric guitars per year. His first guitar debuted at Blade Magazines Blade Show in Atlanta in June 2007. In 2008, Emerson opened a clothing company called \\"Emerson Brand Apparel\\" specializing in MMA and casual clothing. In 2009 at the annual NRA Convention, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom pistol manufacturer Les Baer to produce a custom M1911 pistol built to Emerson's specifications with a semi- custom (handground blade) folding knife named the \\"CQC-45\\"(out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the pistol). In late 2009, Emerson announced a collaboration with Spike's Tactical to produce an M-4 Carbine based upon his specifications for training, chambered in .22 long rifle and in 5.56 NATO; with a matching folding knife designated the \\"CQC-22\\" (out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the rifle). In September 2010, Emerson announced a collaboration with Pro-Tech Knives to produce an automatic opening version of the CQC-7. In November 2010, Emerson's Roadhouse Knife won Knives Illustrateds American Made Knife of 2010‚Äì2011 Award at the Spirit of Steel Show in Knoxville, TN. According to Emerson, the knife will be used as a prop on the Sons of Anarchy Television Show. In January 2011, at the SHOT (Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade) Show in Las Vegas, NV, Emerson debuted a new knife model designed in collaboration with Kelly McCann known as the Canis. Emerson's knives in the media New York Times bestselling author David Morrell's novel The Protector not only has the main character, a former Delta Force operator named Cavanaugh, using an Emerson CQC-7 knife, but the cover art itself is a photographic illustration of a blood-stained Emerson CQC-7. Cavanaugh uses the knife in combat as well as in many rigorous cutting chores. The author claims Emerson is \\"the best manufacturer of tactical knives\\" as well as a \\"top level blade instructor for elite military and law-enforcement units\\". In an interview with British E-Zine Shots : The Crime and Mystery Ezine, Morrell indicated that he injured his collarbone during an Emerson knife-fighting course while performing research for the novel. Morrell went on to include Emerson's knives in his books Creepers and The Spy Who Came for Christmas. Emerson Combat Systems Emerson has developed a combatives system drawn upon his experience known as Emerson Combat Systems, which has been taught to hundreds of law enforcement agencies, members of the U.S. military, and civilians. According to Emerson, the techniques are based upon the physical and instinctual laws that govern the survival instincts and physical function of a human being. This system is characterized by training as realistically as possible (not training in workout gear for example) and using flowing, dynamic concepts (for example, integrated fighting and weapon transition with a strong emphasis placed on overall physical fitness. Emerson maintains he does not teach a \\"martial art\\" encumbered by ritual or sporting aspects but a combatives system where the goal is more than simple self-defense. Emerson has been consulted as a technical advisor to television and movie productions including National Geographic, specifically the program Fight Science, due in part to his position as the hand-to-hand combat instructor for Harry Humphries' Global Studies Group Incorporated, a company that teaches police and military tactics to law enforcement agencies and film production crews. As an author, Emerson has written over 30 articles on hand-to-hand combat, knife fighting, history, and knifemaking for publications including Human Events, Blade Magazine, American Cop Magazine, Martial Arts Experts, Journal of Modern Combatives, Inside Kung-Fu, Black Belt Magazine, Police Magazine, and American Handgunner. In 2014, Emerson was inducted into the Black Belt Magazine Hall of Fame as \\"Self-Defense Instructor of the Year\\".

In 1307 it was mentioned as ze Lind. The name is probably connected with the 500- to 800-year-old, legendary Linden tree which is east of Linn. In the Middle Ages it probably belonged to the vogtei of Elfingen. In 1460 it was incorporated as part of the court of B√∂zberg in the Canton of Bern. Initially, its inhabitants were part of the Elfingen-B√∂zen parish, and after 1649 the B√∂zberg parish. Before the Reformation in 1528, it possessed a chapel. Agriculture was the major economic activity up into the middle of the 19th century. Due to declining opportunities in the mid-19th century, many of the farming families migrated away.

They were introduced in 1897 and were essentially a larger version of the E3 Class. The cylinder diameter was reduced from by the Southern Railway. History The E4 class of \\"radial tanks\\" were powerful for their size and were stalwarts of local passenger, freight, and branch work for more than fifty years. They very similar to the E3 tank engines from 1891, but the key differences were that their driving wheels were enlarged from 4 foot 6 inches to 5 foot and they had their boiler pressure increased to 160 lb. Some of these engines were named after towns and villages in the LB&SCR; area, No. 469 Beachy Head was an example of this. Some of their names would later be used for H2 Atlantics a few years later. They were so successful at their jobs that they were more commonly signed to passenger work as opposed to freight work, which is what they were originally intended for. Their work was primarily focused around the Southern Region with some going away from their traditional stomping grounds to places like Waterloo, Eastleigh, and Tonbridge. During World War I, the Railway Operating Division borrowed several members of the class include No. 470, No. 481, No. 498, No. 504, No. 506, No. 518, No. 519, No. 562, No. 563, No. 564, No. 565, No. 577, and No. 580 to work in France. They first worked at an ammunition dump in Audruicq, France in November of 1917 and were later sent to the Arras in February of 1918. All of them were returned to their homeland in 1919. Seventy-five members of the class were built by Brighton Works between December 1897 and September 1903. All of the class survived the transfer to Southern Railway ownership in 1923. One example No. 2483 was however destroyed as a result of enemy action against Eastbourne motive power depot in 1942 during a Luftwaffe air raid event known as the Baedeker Blitz. The remainder continued in regular use following the nationalisation of the Southern Railway, one member No. 2510 was tested on the Isle of Wright's railway in 1947 albeit unsuccessfully, to become a part of British Railways in 1948. However, with the arrival of Diesel Multiple Units and the reduction in the number of branch lines after The Reshaping of British Railways in 1963, the locomotives gradually became surplus to operational requirements, and withdrawals commenced in 1955. Most of the class were withdrawn between 1958 and 1964. Accidents and incidents *Locomotive No. 32468 ran into the buffers at station, Brighton, East Sussex - date unknown. Operations No. 32473 (formerly named Birch Grove), at Stewart's Lane in 1960 before withdrawal and subsequent preservation. The E4 class were initially used on local passenger and freight services, and on branch lines. Later in British Railways days, several examples were found new jobs as station pilots, most famously at London Waterloo, where they brought empty carriage rakes into the station from the yards at Clapham Junction. They were also used on services such as the locally famous Lancing Belle, which ran from Brighton to the Lancing Carriage Works of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, often double-headed with members of the same class or the larger E6 class. Numbering British Railways (BR) numbers were 32463-32520, 32556-32566 and 32577-32582. E4X class In 1909, four locomotives were rebuilt by D. E. Marsh with larger boilers and designated E4X. These became BR numbers 32466, 32477, 32478 and 32489. Preservation B473 in preservation at the Bluebell Railway. One of the last survivors in 1963 was No. 32473. This was purchased by a group of preservationists and brought to the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, where it has remained ever since, except for visits to other lines such as the Severn Valley Railway and Isle of Wight Steam Railway. The engine was withdrawn from traffic in 1971 and dismantled. Work however did not start in earnest until the 1980s and following a long overhaul, she returned to traffic in 1997 to celebrate her centenary in 1998. After a short period running in the genuine LB&SCR; livery it carried after 1912, with the company's initials painted on the side tankshttp://www.bluebell- railway.co.uk/bluebell/locos/bg/, these were re-lettered with its earlier LB&SCR; name of Birch Grove. In 2005 she was repainted into British Railways lined black mixed traffic livery. Following withdrawal from service in May 2008, the locomotive was soon brought into the Bluebell workshops for a fast track overhaul, including a repaint into 1920s Southern Railway green to match much of the line's coaching stock. This was completed during January 2010, with the engine relaunched into traffic on 30 January 2010. 32473 is the only ex LB&SCR; preserved locomotive not to be designed by William Stroudley.

It lies on the river Franconian Saale, 25 km west of Schweinfurt. Hammelburg is the oldest winegrowing town (Weinstadt) in Franconia. The Nazi Party placed Hammelburg in Gau Mainfranken. During World War II, Hammelburg was the site of the POW Camps OFLAG XIII-B and Stalag XIII-C, as well as the attempted rescue of POWs from these camps by Task Force Baum in 1945. Lt. Donald Prell of the 106th Infantry Division was one of the POWs liberated by the Task Force. The American television sitcom Hogan's Heroes (which ran on CBS from 1965 to 1971), featured a fictional Luft-Stalag 13, said to be near Hammelburg ‚Äî the German Wehrmacht Heer-operated Stalag XIII-C POW camp was actually located in Hammelburg during World War II. The modern German Army's Infantry School (Infanterieschule) is located in this town. History The name Hammelburg is documented for the first time on 18 April 716 as . At this time, the fortress () in ducal possession was favorable to traffic because of the intersection of east-west and north-south export/import and traffic routes. As a Franconian possession in the year 777, Charlemagne donated Hammelburg with its entire municipal area to the charity of Saint Boniface. Saint Martin's Church () had already been bequeathed in 741 by Carloman to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg, into lawful ownership of Fulda monastery. Hammelburg, because of its location at a ford on the Franconian Saale, was of strategic importance. Directly above the river bank, the Franconian royal court was developed over the hall bank. In the 12th century, Fulda built on the heights over on the Saale's left bank the castle of Saaleck for Hammelburg's protection, which particularly served for control of the Trimburg established by the Hennebergs. In 1234, W√ºrzburg succeeded in appropriating the Trimburg from the Hennebergs. Fulda answered this by moving closer to the old opponent with the attachment of Hammelburg and to the stronger development of Saaleck Castle. In the year 1303, under King Albrecht, municipal rights were granted Hammelburg. The old attachment plant, whose walls and ditches surrounded the city, had three gate towers (Weiher, upper and lower tower) and eleven military towers. From this time still exists the Guardian, Monk and Baderturm, a part of the southern city wall and the received. The Hammelburger citizens had begun by self-initiative in 1302 with the building of a church. This church of Maria () at the cattle market became a symbol of civil self-sufficiency. The building of the parish church pc. Johannes in the old castle district the Hammelburger left to the national gentlemen. The fell victim to a fire in 1854, a fire which also destroyed several other parts of the city. Today the gothic parish church (1389-1461) is an object of historical interest. Despite the support of Fulda and W√ºrzburg, Hammelburg converted very early to the Lutheran faith and only by force did the city return to Catholicism in 1604. 120 Protestant Hammelburger families left their hometown in this year because of it. KellereischlossA few years later, a furious epidemic cost the city even more of its citizens. Because of the heavy losses of these years the city did not recover until the 18th century. From this blooming time of the 16th century, came the (1524-1526) city hall, a new building made in the Renaissance style, from the architect Johannes Sch√∂ner, (1529) where the first council meeting was held therein. Only the lateral stair tower and the city hall cellar remains today. The current city hall, built after the fire in the gothic style, was occupied on December 12, 1859. The Renaissance market well, which was completed in 1541, is likewise a work of the master builder Sch√∂ner. Until 1803, Hammelburg belonged to Fulda. In the course of the German mediatisation it passed to the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda from 1803 until 1806. Under Napoleon's brother-in-law, Marshal Murat, the city was (1806-1810) under French administration. In 1810, it was assigned to the new Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. After a short Austrian affiliation, the city was integrated in 1816 into the Kingdom of Bavaria. In the years after the Second World War the total population of the city was increased by refugees from both Eastern Europe and Eastern Germany and starting from 1956 by the German Federal Armed Forces reorganization. Also in those years, the edge municipalities also saw a large increase in their population. The local reorganisation let the number of inhabitants rise in Hammelburg again. The former municipalities Westheim, Pfaffenhausen, Untererthal, Obererthal, Feuerthal, Morlesau, Obereschenbach with Untereschenbach and Gauaschach attached themselves to the city of Hammelburg, which thus counts approximately 12,500 inhabitants. The oldest Franconian wine city can be reached extremely favorably by the motorway and has a rich variety of attractions. There are several numerous and partially very well received architectural monuments, cosy restaurants and hotels. The sports center contains outdoor and indoor swimming pools, indoor tennis courts, large-sport-resounds, a soccer stadium, the special landing area for aircraft, recreation sites and good hiking possibilities in variety landscapes of S√ºdrh√∂n and Saaletal-valley inviting tourists to stay.

He was known worldwide for his appearances on World Wrestling Federation television as the promotion's figurehead president. Tunney's tenure was during the company's initial worldwide popularity boom in the 1980s, the peak days of \\"Hulkamania\\". Queensbury Athletic Club/Maple Leaf Wrestling =Early life= In 1930, Jack Corcoran set up Toronto's Queensbury Athletic Club (QAC, later known by the unofficial name of Maple Leaf Wrestling), along with Jack's father, John Tunney Sr., his uncle, Frank Tunney, and Toots Mondt. =Working for his uncle= In 1952, Jack entered into employment with the promotion, first as a referee and later in the booking office working alongside Frank, Norm Kimber, Frank Ayerst, Ed Noonan, and wrestlers Whipper Billy Watson and Pat Flanagan, as they promoted all over southern Ontario. The offices were in Maple Leaf Gardens for many years. In the mid 1970s the office was moved across the street on Carlton St. On March 16, 1956, the first title change to take place in Maple Leaf Gardens happened when Whipper Billy Watson defeated Lou Thesz, ending Thesz's near 7-year reign. Thesz again lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship again at the Maple Leaf Gardens on November 14, 1957 when he lost the title to Dick Hutton. In 1960, Frank Tunney replaced Sam Muchnick at the NWA's helm, for a year, as president. He also went on to serve as a vice president to Vince McMahon, Sr. in the WW(W)F, as well as having close ties with Japanese promoters. This meant non-stop action in Maple Leaf Gardens approximately every two weeks. On January 24, 1963, a classic match at Maple Leaf Gardens directly led to the WWWF being formed after Lou Thesz beat World Champion Buddy Rogers and was declared champion. After the event, however, Northeastern promoter Vincent J. McMahon refused to recognize the title change and withdrew his operation from the NWA, becoming the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE), with Rogers as the star performer. The WWWF recognized Rogers as its first world champion in April 1963. Through the years, there were never any serious threats to Tunney's position as ruler of pro wrestling in Toronto. Several promoters ran shows at smaller venues in the area, often with Tunney's blessing or indifference. But in the 1970s, there were two notable attempts by other promoters to run big-venue shows in Toronto. Dave McKigney, a successful promoter outside Toronto and at smaller sites within the city, tried running a show at Varsity Arena in September 1971 with Tony Parisi booked in the main event. Tunney quickly scheduled a Gardens show directly against it. Parisi was a no-show and began working for Tunney the following week. According to the newspapers, the McKigney show drew 700 fans while Tunney got 15,500 at the Gardens. History repeated itself five years later. George Cannon and Milt Avruskin had built strong awareness of their promotion in Toronto through a TV show broadcast on Global TV and taped at the Global studios in Don Mills. They tried to parlay that visibility into running a big-venue show at the CNE Coliseum, but once again Tunney moved quickly to book a Gardens show on the same day. The Toronto Star reported that only 600 people showed up for Cannon's show. =Shared allegiances= In 1977, the Tunneys began looking for a partnership since their major draw (and booker), the Sheik (Edward Farhat) was nearing the end of his popularity as a heel. In 1978, while still utilising some talent from other promotions, including balanced cards for both the AWA and WWF, Frank entered into a partnership with Charlotte, North Carolina-based promoter Jim Crockett, Jr., who ran NWA-affiliated Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling in the Carolinas. The arrangement was largely facilitated by George Scott, a key executive with Crockett who had been a preliminary wrestler for Tunney from 1950 to 1956, before becoming a partner in the Toronto promotion. Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat became the dominant local attractions. Due to their influence at the time, and despite joining forces with Jim Crockett, Maple Leaf Wrestling did not become a one company promotion. Frank continued to pull off his share of promotional coups and, for the first few years, it wasn't unusual to see two world title matches on the same card during this time, as American Wrestling Association (AWA) and WWWF stars continued to perform in the city. The first Gardens card with Crockett's talent featured a historic match between WWWF champ Bob Backlund against then AWA champ Nick Bockwinkel. This kind of match was fairly rare with only a few cases of two promotions matching their respective world champs against each other. The show also included with a classic Steamboat vs. Flair match, both making their Toronto debuts, for the NWA U.S. Title on the undercard. In 1978, along with presenting top wrestlers from the U.S., The Tunneys launched the Canadian title and used it to turn Dewey Robertson and Angelo Mosca into local babyface heroes and main event stars. In 1980, the Tunneys presented shows in Buffalo for the first time, working in alignment with the WWF who had the rights to the arena. The first shows proved somewhat successful drawing over 8,000 fans. The Tunneys would continue with sporadic shows in Buffalo over the next couple of years. In the early '80s, rivalries between the various promotions made it difficult to bring talent from different factions together. Jack takes over On May 10, 1983, Frank Tunney died, after which Jack and his cousin Eddie Tunney (Frank's son) took control of the promotion. With the years of experience under his belt, Jack moved into the spotlight his uncle loved, as the frontman for the promotion, while Eddie had a low public profile, as his silent partner. Jack made an immediate impact on his own. The name Maple Leaf Wrestling became the common place name for the Queensbury Athletic Club. He also promoted two large summer outdoor shows at the Exhibition Stadium, dubbed Night Of Champions and Return Of The Champions. The shows would feature 11 title defences and were main evented by NWA Title defenses by Harley Race against Ric Flair. =Aligning with the World Wrestling Federation= When the promotional wars heated up between Crockett and Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation, Crockett felt he could no longer spare his top wrestlers for shows in Toronto, sending his B-team as attendance at the Gardens plummeted. Crockett's relationship with the promotion had become strained. He held a distrust of Tunney who persistently utilised talent from other promotions, including the WWF. Furthermore, George Scott, still a partner in the Toronto promotion, had chosen to leave Jim Crockett Promotions due to a pay dispute and was now a booker for the WWF. The Toronto cards got progressively weaker through 1983-84, dwindling down to audiences of 3,000 for some shows. Johnny Weaver was the primary booker for the shows, with Leo Burke and his brothers as the lead heels, along with Don Kernodle, when the top Crockett stars were no longer available. Jack decided he no longer wanted to promote cards with a mix of WWF, NWA, and other wrestling talent and decided to switch allegiances from the NWA and aligned himself with Vince McMahon's WWF, promoting only WWF cards north of the border. This made Toronto one of the first former NWA strongholds to jump to the WWF, starting a trend that would continue through the 1980s. After a 34-year run, the NWA title‚Äîwhich had made its Gardens debut in October 1949‚Äîmade its final appearance in the building in May 1984. Whatever nostalgic feelings long-time fans had for the old days, the McMahon-Tunney alliance and Hulkamania captured a whole new audience, attracting sell-out crowds to the Gardens and drawing over 65,000 people to Exhibition Stadium in 1986 and 68,000 to SkyDome for Wrestlemania VI in 1990 to see Hulk Hogan lose the WWF title to the Ultimate Warrior. In June 1984, barely a year since they had taken over the Queensbury Athletic Club from his late uncle Frank, Jack, with Frank's son Eddie, transferred controlling interest of the promotion to the WWF in a maneuver which officially made Toronto a WWF city. =Consequences= The deal between the Tunneys and the WWF was a complex one. The WWF effectively owned Maple Leaf Wrestling and absorbed Jack Tunney into its administration as head of Canadian tours (Due to this, Jack had more power than his cousin Eddie, despite initial plans for Eddie to join Titan sports too). However, the Toronto office remained an independent entity, without which the WWF could not book shows at the Gardens and which received a percentage of every show the company ran in Canada. For Canadian Wrestling promotions, the effect was lasting. The Canadian wrestling scene was struggling at the time, with attendance low. As critics had feared it would, the union between Tunney and McMahon crushed many other wrestling promotions in Canada. Soon, wrestling promotions across Canada fell on hard times as Tunney helped McMahon take over their territories. All-Star Wrestling in Vancouver closed down. The AWA stopped performing in Manitoba. Stu Hart's Stampede promotion began eroding until he too was forced to sell to McMahon (and later starting up again for a few years). Grand Prix, out of Montreal, fought Tunney, but also eventually succumbed. Dave McKigney's Big Time Wrestling couldn't make a go of it due to Tunney's pressuring of Ontario's Boxing & Wrestling Commission to make insurance too expensive for the little guys. New territories, such as Newfoundland were opened up by Lyons and Zarlenga, but could not compete with a WWF machine, consistently setting new attendance records. For the WWF, moving into the struggling Canadian market, by promoting events at the Maple Leaf Gardens every month, was part of an unheard of and risky national business model, which stretched the company. However, the move made enormous business sense and was instrumental in consolidating WWF's power base in Canada, keeping their competitors out of key Canadian markets, well into the 1990s. With the Gardens locked up by the WWF, the AWA held a show at the CNE Coliseum in December 1989 that drew what remains the smallest crowd ever in the city for a show from major promotion, just 200 people. World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the successor to Crockett, ran three shows at the Coliseum in 1990 with better results, but not good enough to keep Toronto on their schedule. On April 1, 1990 Jack Tunney and Vince McMahon set the stage for WrestleMania VI the very first wrestling event at the brand new Toronto SkyDome. The event set a one-day attendance record for the SkyDome of 67,982. WCW came back in 1993 and drew about 4,000 to SkyDome, and then made a big return to Toronto with two well-attended shows at the Air Canada Centre in 1999 before the promotion fizzled out. For Maple Leaf Wrestling, critics feared the new partnership would make Toronto just another stop on the WWF circuit. The highest title in the territory, the Canadian Heavyweight Championship (going all the way back to the 30s) was abandoned (although it was resurrected in 1998 and continues to be recognized to this day in the Canadian independent scene). The Maple Leaf Wrestling name continued to be used for the federation's Canadian TV program (a staple of Hamilton station CHCH-TV for many years), of which the WWF took over production after the Tunneys split from the NWA. TV tapings for the show were held in Brantford and other cities in southern Ontario for the next two years, until the WWF ceased the tapings in 1986 and decided to simply use the Maple Leaf Wrestling name for the Canadian airings of WWF Superstars of Wrestling (with some Canadian footage, such as updates by on-air announcer and former wrestler Billy Red Lyons, and special matches taped at Maple Leaf Gardens, added in). There were several sellouts of 18,000 at the Gardens with the WWF crew, but the city's (and, at the time, world's) attendance record was shattered by the show at CNE Stadium on August 28, 1986 which drew 65,000 people, with a gate of over $1 million. At this time, Maple Leaf Wrestling basically ceased to exist. Gone were the days of homegrown talent supplemented by a steady stream of World Champions and stars from all corners of the globe to be replaced by the oncoming Hulkamania. For the Tunney Family, the move led to a new level of reverence. In 1987, The WWF held an event called the \\"Frank Tunney Memorial Tag Team Tournament\\" (the NWA had held a similar event honoring Jim Crockett Sr.) in March 1987. They credited Tunney with bringing tag team matches to North America. The tournament was won by the Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell & B. Brian Blair). For Jack Tunney, this move made him extremely influential and forged his lasting legacy: * Tunney was made the chief WWF Promoter for Canadian tours (the position later taken by Carl De Marco). * Tunney was also made the president of Titan Sports Canada, the WWF's Canadian corporate presence, after McMahon began operating under that entity in late 1989. * Jack Tunney and his cousin Eddie Tunney retained a one-third stake in the Maple Leaf Wrestling promotion, with George Scott holding one-sixth (until 1987). * Tunney still controlled the booking of Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto to a large extent, and also covered southern Ontario and Buffalo, New York. * Due to his new position, Jack, along with his associates Billy Red Lyons and Elio Zarlenga, would usually promote 40 or more WWF shows per year, making him a very important man in the expansion of the WWF, to the status that it enjoys today. Billy Red Lyons, the longtime wrestling star from Dundas, Ont., who worked as a WWF television commentator at the time of the deal said: ‚Ä≥The timing was perfect, Vince (McMahon) had started to make his move all over the United States. He had big ideas and everybody thought he was just crazy, but not Jack. He saw what kind of an opportunity it was. Thank God the WWF did come in here because the business was dead in Toronto. Local wrestling cards had been drawing just 3,000 a night while the WWF was on the cusp of a popularity explosion when Tunney latched on.‚Ä≥ =As the figurehead president (September 1984 ‚Äì July 12, 1995)= In the summer of 1984 (in part to present Canadian fans with a familiar face as the WWF tried to expand northward) the WWF named Tunney its new figurehead \\"president\\" (a similar role to that of current WWE general managers) on the company's television programs, replacing Hisashi Shinma. Tunney filled this role for over a decade (while the '80s \\"Hulkamania\\" boom, was at its peak). This made Tunney known to fans not only in North America but also worldwide. The title was ceremonial only to provide an authority figure to announce major decisions on television, as Tunney held no backstage power beyond that of a regional promoter; as such, his main roles were that of a storyline authority figure, to make matches, arbitrate disputes between wrestlers and announce major decisions or events on television. Still, he was thrown onto TV whenever a major decision had to be announced and his hard nosed way of doing things earned him the nickname \\"The Hammerhead\\". His on-air decisions were portrayed as legitimate in storylines. As the on-screen President, Tunney \\"oversaw\\" many key moments and some of his major television appearances included: * 1986 ‚Äì Suspending Andr√© the Giant from competition after he failed to show for a series of matches. The last being a match in which Andre was supposed to team with Hillbilly Jim against Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. Bobby \\"the Brain\\" Heenan was upset and asked Tunney to suspend him, which he did. Heenan later claimed that Andre was competing as the masked \\"Giant Machine\\", and was told by Tunney that if Andre was proven to be one of The Machines, Andre would be suspended for life. (The angle regarding Andre's absence was to give Andre some much needed time off, due to a tour of Japan and to tend to health problems he was starting to experience). * On \\"Piper's Pit\\", reading proclamations and giving trophies to Hulk Hogan and Andr√© the Giant (for being WWF Heavyweight Champion for three years and attaining a 15-year undefeated streak, respectively). In one of these he unveiled a new Heavyweight Belt, which was said to be long enough for Andre's waist, as requested by his new manager Bobby Heenan. These appearances were part of an angle foreshadowing Andre's heel turn and set up the main event match at WrestleMania III as Hogan's trophy was reportedly bigger than Andre's. * January 26, 1987 ‚Äì Suspending referee Danny Davis \\"for life plus ten years\\" after officiating a match where Davis allowed The Hart Foundation to use illegal double-team maneuvers before defeating the British Bulldogs for the WWF Tag Team Championship. He had already officiated a series of controversial matches where he favored the heels for which Tunney had forced an apology from Davis, which included the line \\"...even though I don't mean it\\". * Later in 1987, in response to the kidnapping of the British Bulldogs canine mascot Matilda, indefinitely suspending The Islanders until Matilda was found. The Islanders, as part of an angle, kidnapped Matilda during a match to heat up their feud. * February 5, 1988, during another Hulk Hogan versus Andre The Giant match. Dave Hebner was supposed to be the referee, but it turned out that Ted DiBiase had paid off Dave's twin brother, Earl, to screw Hogan out of the Title. At one point, Andre had Hogan pinned and, although Hogan had a shoulder up, a three count was recorded anyway. Dave came to the ring and argued with his brother. Andre ended up handing the belt to DiBiase. * Several times, Tunney's presence was known even off-camera. One such example was, as part of an angle involving the Andre-Hogan match aired on The Main Event I. As the Superstars of Wrestling program that aired February 6, 1988 was produced prior to the airing of The Main Event (where Andre's title win was booked to take place), a side storyline was contrived to have Tunney place a \\"gag order\\" on announcers and commentators from discussing the events surrounding the Andre-Hogan match. Heel color commentator Jesse \\"the Body\\" Ventura attempted to bring up the subject several times but was censored each time, upsetting him so much that he left the broadcast booth toward the end of the show. * Stripping \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase of the WWF Heavyweight Championship after acquiring the title from new champion Andr√© the Giant in exchange for a huge financial payoff. Tunney, who also refused to return the title to Hogan by voiding Andre's controversial pinfall win, declared the championship vacant and announced a 14-man tournament to compete for the held- up championship at WrestleMania IV. The WWF Heavyweight Championship tournament was eventually won by \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage, who defeated Dibiase in the final round. * 1988 ‚Äì Tunney was rarely involved in physical confrontations with wrestlers. One exception was when Bad News Brown confronted Tunney on the set of \\"The Brother Love Show\\" and demanded a WWF title shot against then-champion Savage. When Brown began implying that Tunney and Savage's manager Miss Elizabeth were involved in an affair (suggesting that Miss Elizabeth was \\"doing favors\\" for Tunney to protect Savage from sure defeat), Tunney began scolding Brown for making such a claim, poking his finger in his chest to assert his authority. Brown then grabbed Tunney by his necktie and warned him never to touch him again. * 1989 ‚Äì Jack Tunney banned \\"Rugged\\" Ronnie Garvin from refereeing. Garvin was portraying a referee after losing a retirement match to Greg Valentine, but during matches, he would fight with the wrestlers who would not listen to his orders. Despite warnings by Tunney, Garvin punched Valentine during his match against Jimmy Snuka, which led to him being banned from refereeing. * 1990 ‚Äì He reversed The Rockers' shock tag title win at an Indiana house show to justify WWF writers ignoring the switch on TV. * February 10, 1990 ‚Äì Jack Tunney officially announced the main event of WrestleMania VI. On February 24, Tunney announced \\"The Ultimate Challenge\\" where both the WWF Championship (Hulk Hogan) and Intercontinental Championship (Ultimate Warrior) would be on the line for the first-time ever during the match. * April 1, 1990 ‚Äì The peak of Tunney's WWF reign was WrestleMania VI at Toronto's SkyDome. The first WrestleMania held outside of the U.S., the show drew over 67,000. In the main event The Ultimate Warrior (The Intercontinental champion) cleanly pinned Hulk Hogan to win the WWF World Title, and Tunney announced on television there would be no rematch. * April 15, 1990 on Wrestling Challenge ‚Äì Jack Tunney announces that the Intercontinental title is vacant since one man cannot defend both titles. Tunney then sets up a tournament for the title. * 1990 ‚Äì Restricting Demolition to two active members following the 1990 Survivor Series. (This action was announced to explain the departure of Bill Eadie, who performed as the \\"third\\" Demolition member Ax, from the WWF). * Late 1990 ‚Äì Suspending Rick Rude for making some crude remarks about the Big Bossman's mother for several weeks, culminating in four minutes of \\"Boss Man's Mama\\" jokes. Finally, Tunney had had enough and fired him. In reality, the suspension explained Rude's departure from the WWF over a dispute. * February 1991 ‚Äì Tunney named Hulk Hogan as the number one contender for the WWF Heavyweight Title. Hogan would defeat Sergeant Slaughter to win the WWF Heavyweight Title for the third time at Wrestlemania VII. * Fall of 1991 ‚Äì Distorting the \\"Real World\\" title belt of Ric Flair in televised promos when he began performing for the WWF. * 1991 ‚Äì Tunney became embroiled in a feud between the retired Randy \\"Macho Man\\" Savage (As a result of his loss to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII) and Jake \\"the Snake\\" Roberts. Jake ruined the wedding party of the Macho Man and Miss Elizabeth after SummerSlam 1991. Macho Man petitioned to be reinstated and the public wanted to see Savage get revenge on Roberts, but Tunney released a statement saying that he was taking the matter \\"under advisement\\". Savage nearly got involved in Survivor Series 1991, but in the midst of a scuffle in the ring, Roberts allowed a venomous king cobra to bite the arm of Randy Savage while Savage was restrained in the ropes. Tunney prohibited Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts from bringing his snake to the ring and officially reinstated Savage in time for a match at the Tuesday in Texas pay- per-view. Savage would defeat Roberts at this event and Tunney escorted Roberts from ringside, following the post-match beatdown of Savage and slapping Miss Elizabeth's face. * On December 3, 1991 ‚Äì At Tuesday in Texas, Tunney watched the Hulk Hogan-Undertaker heavyweight title match from ringside to ensure a \\"fair match\\" with no outside interference. Toward the end of the match, Ric Flair came down and got into an argument with Tunney who was watching the match from ringside. Hogan grabbed a chair and hit Flair in the back with it. Flair fell into Tunney and they both went down. Hogan used the ashes from the Undertaker's urn to blind the Undertaker and rolled him up to win back the WWF Heavyweight Title. In the aftermath, Tunney stripped Hogan of the title and declared that the championship would be filled by the winner of the 1992 Royal Rumble. * January 19, 1992 ‚Äì At the \\"Royal Rumble\\", WWF President Jack Tunney gave Hogan and Undertaker an advantage in the random draw to determine the order in which wrestlers would enter the ring, promising them numbers between 20 and 30. Ric Flair entered at number three and lasted over an hour to become champion. During the show, Bobby Heenan called him \\"Jack On the take Tunney\\". * January 25, 1992 ‚Äì On the Superstars program following the Royal Rumble, Tunney held a press conference, where he announced that Hogan the No.1 contender, meaning that he would face Flair for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania VIII. Sid Justice, who was also in attendance and began standing up as if Tunney were about to proclaim him the top contender, was outraged and termed the announcement \\"the most bogus act Jack Tunney has ever pulled off.\\" * May 1, 1993 ‚Äì Tunney granted Bret Hart entry into the King of the Ring (1993) tournament without requiring him to win a qualifying match. This was consolation for a result of Hart's controversial loss to Yokozuna at Wrestlemania IX. * In September 1993 ‚Äì Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Shawn Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for steroids (a charge he never admitted) and that Michaels refused to drop the belt. Michaels left the WWF for around a month. * In the buildup to Summerslam 1993 ‚Äì Tunney ruled that Lex Luger couldn't use his forearm in his match against Yokozuna unless he wore a protective pad. The point of contention was a steel plate inside Luger's arm, which opponents claimed was a weapon used to increase the force of his forearm smash finisher; Tunney said the plate was part of Luger's body. At the event, Luger won by countout when he used his forearm to knock Yokozuna out of the ring, and Yokozuna couldn't answer the 10 count. As a result, Yokozuna retained the WWF Heavyweight Title. * Summerslam 1993 ‚Äì Tunney came to the ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Jerry Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in his scheduled match with Bret Hart. Lawler, however, appeared on crutches (but in his wrestling gear) and claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He announced that his court jester, Doink the Clown (portrayed by Matt Osborne), would wrestle Hart in his place. * In the summer of 1994, he forced Lawler to apologize to Duke Droese for \\"demonstrating such a brutal amount of violence\\". * January 22, 1994 ‚Äì Before the Royal Rumble match began, commentator Vince McMahon announced that WWF President Jack Tunney had shortened the interval between entrances from the traditional two minutes to 90 seconds due to time constraints. One of his final major appearances came in the aftermath of the Royal Rumble ‚Äî both Bret \\"the Hitman\\" Hart and Luger simultaneously eliminated each other, and two debating referees failed to agree on a winner ‚Äî Tunney declared Bret Hart and Luger co-\\"winners\\" of the 1994 Royal Rumble after it could not be determined whose feet hit the floor first. Modifying a stipulation of the Royal Rumble match's outcome, both men would be granted separate matches vs. WWF Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna for the title at WrestleMania X. * January 23, 1994 ‚Äì On the WWF Monday Night Raw aired after the Royal Rumble, Tunney declared that a coin toss would determine whether Luger or Hart would get to first wrestle WWF Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna at WrestleMania X for the title. (A championship match at WrestleMania was the prize given to the Royal Rumble match winner.) Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first. * June 16, 1994 ‚Äì Made a brief (and increasingly rare) live appearance for the coronation ceremony of the 1994 King Of The Ring, Owen Hart. Owen gives Tunney the brush-off so that Neidhart could crown him. Unlike later authority figures in wrestling, Jack Tunney only appeared on screen when a major decision was needed, which made his announcements seem important. Jack Tunney's on screen character was neutral, rather than the later heel authority figures. However, Tunney's decisions often upset the leading face characters, such as Hulk Hogan. Unlike the WWF's later \\"Attitude Era\\", which included storylines of Stone Cold Steve Austin, and others, regularly attacking authority figures, even heel wrestlers rarely got physical with Tunney. Controversies In late 1989, Vince McMahon and Titan Sports dropped their partnership with the Tunney family, but hired Jack as the head of Titan Sports Canada. This cut Eddie Tunney, who had been Jack's partner, out of the partnership with the WWF. Eddie Tunney sued Titan and Jack Tunney. Titan had made the security deposit that reserved the Skydome for WrestleMania VI, and Eddie Tunney had signed the check. Eddie Tunney had also trademarked the \\"WrestleMania\\" name in Canada. Titan Sports had to settle the lawsuit with Eddie Tunney in order to run WrestleMania VI. Tunney supposedly witnessed Terry Garvin sexually harass former WWF referee Mike Clark in the Toronto office and was prepared to back Clark in court. Allegedly, the WWF believed that both Tunney and Clark should toe the company line and let the incident pass for the greater good of the company. According to the Pro Wrestling Observer, towards the end, Tunney believed it was Bret Hart who got him fired (Hart denies this). Tunney didn't think Bret would ever draw money, didn't approve of his main event push and complained publicly about various Hart- related issues. By the time Bret became the top guy, Tunney was unpopular with the faction in the office who got along with Bret. There have long been rumors that Jack Tunney had used company money to pay off gambling debts. This has been rejected by those close to Tunney as an excuse made by the WWF for turning their backs on Jack. Departure from the WWF In the 1990s, Tunney's appearances on television and live events grew less frequent. On July 12, 1995, due to financial struggles, McMahon chose to close its Toronto office and run the shows in Toronto without any involvement from Tunney's Toronto office (Billy \\"Red\\" Lyons was also gone since he helped Tunney run the office). Tunney was forced out of the WWF, retired and disappeared from the wrestling scene. Following Tunney's departure, Gorilla Monsoon was given the role of on-screen WWF President. Tunney never returned to pro wrestling and this was the end of the Tunney line of Toronto wrestling promoters. On September 17, 1995, the final WWF show was held at the Gardens and the 64-year affiliation of pro wrestling and Maple Leaf Gardens ended, since Tunney took with him the exclusive rights to wrestling at the Maple Leaf Gardens. Wrestling would return to Toronto on August 24, 1996, with a WWF show held outdoors at Exhibition Stadium drawing 21,211 fans. In 1997 the WWF, still unable to run shows at Maple Leaf Gardens, held a Monday Night Raw taping on January 31, 1997 at the SkyDome. Maple Leaf Gardens closed entirely in 1999, and the WWF returned to regular arena shows at the Air Canada Centre, which opened that fall. Death On January 24, 2004, at the age of 69, Tunney died of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Waterdown, Ontario, after a sudden illness. Frank Zicarelli wrote in the Toronto Sun \\"He was a very kind and gracious man who did a lot for charities, too\\". Tunney's firing from the WWF was never resolved, and upon his death not a single representative from the WWF was present at his funeral, nor was his death announced on WWE.com. However, he is still fondly remembered by WWF fans for his numerous appearances with the company and the memorable, iconic moments he was involved in during his spell as WWF President.https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/remembering-jack- tunney/ Posthumous legal battle After Jack Tunney's death in 2004, there was some discussion of whether North Carolina-based promoter Jim Crockett was ever a partner in the Toronto office. In Canada, during most of the 1970s and the early 1980s, there was a law called the Foreign Investment Review Act (FIRA) which regulated the foreign ownership of Canadian companies. In November 1980, the Canadian Press reported that the government had approved the creation of a new business called Frank Tunney Sports Promotion, which was co-owned by Frank Tunney Sports Ltd., Jim Crockett Promotions Inc., and 410430 Ontario Ltd., said to be based in Hamilton. The owner of the numbered corporation wasn't identified (it would be a matter of public record, but you have to pay a service charge to access Ontario corporate records), but Hamilton native George Scott is thought to have been the third partner. He continued to own a part of the office after the affiliation with McMahon and is said to have received a large settlement after he was pushed out of that partnership.

A basic thermophotovoltaic system consists of a thermal emitter and a photovoltaic diode cell. The temperature of the thermal emitter varies between different systems from about 900 ¬∞C to about 1300 ¬∞C, although in principle TPV devices can extract energy from any emitter with temperature elevated above that of the photovoltaic device (forming an optical heat engine). The emitter can be a piece of solid material or a specially engineered structure. Thermal emission is the spontaneous emission of photons due to thermal motion of charges in the material. For these TPV temperatures, this radiation is mostly at near infrared and infrared frequencies. The photovoltaic diodes absorbs some of these radiated photons and converts them into electricity. Thermophotovoltaic systems have few to no moving parts and are therefore quiet and require little maintenance. These properties make thermophotovoltaic systems suitable for remote-site and portable electricity-generating applications. Their efficiency-cost properties, however, are often poor compared to other electricity-generating technologies since they require solar tracking. Current research in the area aims at increasing system efficiencies while keeping the system cost low. TPV systems usually attempt to match the optical properties of thermal emission (wavelength, polarization, direction) with the most efficient absorption characteristics of the photovoltaic cell, since unconverted thermal emission is a major source of inefficiency. Most groups focus on gallium antimonide (GaSb) cells. Germanium (Ge) is also suitable. Much research and development concerns methods for controlling the emitter's properties. TPV cells have been proposed as auxiliary power conversion devices for capture of otherwise lost heat in other power generation systems, such as steam turbine systems or solar cells. A prototype TPV hybrid car was built, the \\"Viking 29\\" (TPV) powered automobile, designed and built by the Vehicle Research Institute (VRI) at Western Washington University. TPV research is an active area. Among others, the University of Houston TPV Radioisotope Power Conversion Technology development effort is attempting to combine a thermophotovoltaic cell with thermocouples to provide a 3 to 4-fold improvement in system efficiency over current radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Panels can also be made using thermoradiative cells. In 2020, Professor Jeremy Munday devised panels that would allow the harvest of electricity from the night sky. The panels would be able to generate up to 50 watts of power per square meter, which is a quarter of what conventional panels can generate in the daytime. History Henry Kolm constructed an elementary TPV system at MIT in 1956. However, Pierre Aigrain is widely cited as the inventor based on the content of lectures he gave at MIT between 1960‚Äì1961 which, unlike Kolm's system, led to research and development. Background Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) are a class of power generating systems that convert thermal energy into electrical energy. They consist of, at a minimum, an emitter and a photovoltaic power converter. Most TPV systems include additional components such as concentrators, filters and reflectors. The basic principle is similar to that of traditional photovoltaics (PV) where a p-n junction is used to absorb optical energy, generate and separate electron/hole pairs, and in doing so convert that energy into electricity. The difference is that the optical energy is not directly generated by the Sun, but instead by a material at high temperature (termed the emitter), that causes it to emit light. In this way thermal energy is converted to electrical energy. The emitter can be heated by sunlight or other techniques. In this sense, TPVs provide a great deal of versatility in potential fuels. In the case of solar TPVs, large concentrators are needed to provide reasonable temperatures for efficient operation. Improvements can take advantage of filters or selective emitters to create emissions in a wavelength range that is optimized for a specific photovoltaic (PV) converter. In this way TPVs can overcome a fundamental challenge for traditional PVs, making efficient use of the entire solar spectrum. For black body emitters, photons with energy less than the bandgap of the converter cannot be absorbed and are either reflected and lost or pass through the cell. Photons with energy above the bandgap can be absorbed, but the excess energy, \\\\Delta G = E_{photon} - E_{g} , is again lost, generating undesirable heating in the cell. In the case of TPVs, similar issues can exist, but the use of either selective emitters (emissivity over a specific wavelength range), or optical filters that only pass a narrow range of wavelengths and reflect all others, can be used to generate emission spectra that can be optimally converted by the PV device. To maximize efficiency, all photons should be converted. A process often termed photon recycling can be used to approach this. Reflectors are placed behind the converter and anywhere else in the system that photons might not be efficiently directed to the collector. These photons are directed back to the concentrator where they can be converted, or back to the emitter, where they can be reabsorbed to generate heat and additional photons. An optimal TPV system would use photon recycling and selective emission to convert all photons into electricity. Efficiency The upper limit for efficiency in TPVs (and all systems that convert heat energy to work) is the Carnot efficiency, that of an ideal heat engine. This efficiency is given by: :\\\\eta = 1 - \\\\frac{T_{cell}}{T_{emit}} where Tcell is the temperature of the PV converter. For the best reasonable values in a practical system, Tcell~300K and Temit~1800, giving a maximum efficiency of ~83%. This limit sets the upper limit for the system efficiency. At 83% efficiency, all heat energy is converted to radiation by the emitter which is then converted by the PV into electrical energy without losses, such as thermalization or Joule heating. Maximum efficiency presumes no entropy change, which is only possible if the emitter and cell are at the same temperature. More accurate models are quite complicated. =Emitters= Deviations from perfect absorption and perfect black body behavior lead to light losses. For selective emitters, any light emitted at wavelengths not matched to the bandgap energy of the photovoltaic may not be efficiently converted (for reasons discussed above) and leads to reduced efficiency. In particular, emissions associated with phonon resonances are difficult to avoid for wavelengths in the deep infrared, which cannot be practically converted. Ideal emitters produce no infrared. =Filters= For black body emitters or imperfect selective emitters, filters reflect non-ideal wavelengths back to the emitter. These filters are imperfect. Any light that is absorbed or scattered and not redirected to the emitter or the converter is lost, generally as heat. Conversely, practical filters often reflect a small percentage of light in desired wavelength ranges. Both are inefficiencies. =Converters= Even for systems where only light of optimal wavelengths is passed to the converter, inefficiencies associated with non-radiative recombination and ohmic losses exist. Since these losses can depend on the light intensity incident on the cell, real systems must consider the intensity produced by a given set of conditions (emitter material, filter, operating temperature). =Geometry= In an ideal system, the emitter would be surrounded by converters so no light is lost. However, realistically, geometries must accommodate the input energy (fuel injection or input light) used to heat the emitter. Additionally, costs prohibit the placement of converters everywhere. When the emitter reemits light, anything that does not travel to the converters is lost. Mirrors can be used to redirect some of this light back to the emitter; however, the mirrors may have their own losses. Black body radiation For black body emitters where photon recirculation is achieved via filters, Planck's law states that a black body emits light with a spectrum given by: I'(\\\\lambda,T) =\\\\frac{2 hc^2}{\\\\lambda^5}\\\\frac{1}{ e^{\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda kT}}-1} where I' is the flux of light of a specific wavelength, Œª, given in units of 1/m3/s. h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, and Temit is the emitter temperature. Thus, the light flux with wavelengths in a specific range can be found by integrating over the range. The peak wavelength is determined by the temperature, Temit based on Wien's displacement law: :\\\\lambda_{\\\\mathrm{max}} = \\\\frac{b}{T} where b is Wien's displacement constant. For most materials, the maximum temperature an emitter can stably operate at is about 1800 ¬∞C. This corresponds to an intensity that peaks at Œª~1600 nm or an energy of ~0.75 eV. For more reasonable operating temperatures of 1200 ¬∞C, this drops to ~0.5 eV. These energies dictate the range of bandgaps that are needed for practical TPV converters (though the peak spectral power is slightly higher). Traditional PV materials such as Si (1.1 eV) and GaAs (1.4 eV) are substantially less practical for TPV systems, as the intensity of the black body spectrum is extremely low at these energies for emitters at realistic temperatures. Active components and materials selection =Emitters= Efficiency, temperature resistance and cost are the three major factors for choosing a TPV radiator. Efficiency is determined by energy absorbed relative to total incoming radiation. High temperature operation is a crucial factor because efficiency increases with operating temperature. As emitter temperature increases, black-body radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, allowing for more efficient absorption by photovoltaic cells. Cost is another major commercialization issue. Polycrystalline silicon carbide Polycrystalline silicon carbide (SiC) is the most commonly used emitter for burner TPVs. SiC is thermally stable to ~1700 ¬∞C. However, SiC radiates much of its energy in the long wavelength regime, far lower in energy than even the narrowest bandgap photovoltaic. This radiation is not converted into electrical energy. However, non-absorbing selective filters in front of the PV,Horne E. (2002). Hybrid thermophotovoltaic power systems. Final report by EDTEK Inc. for the California energy commission. or mirrors deposited on the back side of the PV can be used to reflect the long wavelengths back to the emitter, thereby recycling the unconverted energy. In addition, polycrystalline SiC is cheap to manufacture. Tungsten Refractory metals can be used as selective emitters for burner TPVs. Tungsten is the most common choice. It has higher emissivity in the visible and near-IR range of 0.45 to 0.47 and a low emissivity of 0.1 to 0.2 in the IR region.Malyshev, V. I. (1979). Introduction to Experimental Spectroscopy (in Russian) Nauka, Moscow. The emitter is usually in the shape of a cylinder with a sealed bottom, which can be considered a cavity. The emitter is attached to the back of a thermal absorber such as SiC and maintains the same temperature. Emission occurs in the visible and near IR range, which can be readily converted by the PV to electrical energy. Rare-earth oxides Rare-earth oxides such as ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3) and erbium oxide (Er2O3) are the most commonly used selective emitters for TPVs. These oxides emit a narrow band of wavelengths in the near-infrared region, allowing the tailoring of the emission spectra to better fit the absorbance characteristics of a particular PV cell. The peak of the emission spectrum occurs at 1.29 eV for Yb2O3 and 0.827 eV for Er2O3. As a result, Yb2O3 can be used a selective emitter for Si PV cells and Er2O3, for GaSb or InGaAs. However, the slight mismatch between the emission peaks and band gap of the absorber results in a significant loss of efficiency. Selective emission only becomes significant at 1100 ¬∞C and increases with temperature, per Planck's Law. At operating temperatures below 1700 ¬∞C, selective emission of rare-earth oxides is fairly low, resulting in a further decrease in efficiency. Currently, 13% efficiency has been achieved with Yb2O3 and silicon PV cells. In general selective emitters have had limited success. More often filters are used with black body emitters to pass wavelengths matched to the bandgap of the PV and reflect mismatched wavelengths back to the emitter. Photonic crystals Photonic crystals are a class of periodic materials that allow the precise control of electromagnetic wave properties. These materials give rise to the photonic bandgap (PBG). In the spectral range of the PBG, electromagnetic waves cannot propagate. The engineering of these materials allows some ability to tailor their emission and absorption properties, allowing for more effective design of selective emitters. Selective emitters with peaks at higher energy than the black body peak (for practical TPV temperatures) allow for wider bandgap converters. These converters are traditionally cheaper to manufacture and less temperature sensitive. Researchers at Sandia Labs demonstrated a high-efficiency (34% of light emitted from PBG selective emitter can be converted to electricity) TPV emitter using tungsten photonic crystals. However, manufacturing of these devices is difficult and not commercially feasible. =Photovoltaic cells= Silicon Early work in TPVs focused on the use of Si PVs. Silicon's commercial availability, extremely low cost, scalability and ease of manufacture makes this material an appealing candidate. However, the relatively wide bandgap of Si (1.1eV) is not ideal for use with a black body emitter at lower operating temperatures. Calculations using Planck's law, which describes the black body spectrum as a function of temperature, indicates that Si PVs would only be feasible at temperatures much higher than 2000 K. No emitter has been demonstrated that can operate at these temperatures. These engineering difficulties led to the pursuit of lower- bandgap semiconductor PVs. Using selective radiators with Si PVs is still a possibility. Selective radiators would eliminate high and low energy photons, reducing heat generated. Ideally, selective radiators would emit no radiation beyond the band edge of the PV converter, increasing conversion efficiency significantly. No efficient TPVs have been realized using Si PVs. Germanium Early investigations into low bandgap semiconductors focused on germanium (Ge). Ge has a bandgap of 0.66 eV, allowing for conversion of a much higher fraction of incoming radiation. However, poor performance was observed due to the extremely high effective electron mass of Ge. Compared to III-V semiconductors, Ge's high electron effective mass leads to a high density of states in the conduction band and therefore a high intrinsic carrier concentration. As a result, Ge diodes have fast decaying \\"dark\\" current and therefore, a low open-circuit voltage. In addition, surface passivation of germanium has proven extremely difficult. Gallium antimonide The gallium antimonide (GaSb) PV cell, invented in 1989, is the basis of most PV cells in modern TPV systems. GaSb is a III-V semiconductor with the zinc blende crystal structure. The GaSb cell is a key development owing to its narrow bandgap of 0.72 eV. This allows GaSb to respond to light at longer wavelengths than silicon solar cell, enabling higher power densities in conjunction with manmade emission sources. A solar cell with 35% efficiency was demonstrated using a bilayer PV with GaAs and GaSb, setting the solar cell efficiency record. Manufacturing a GaSb PV cell is quite simple. Czochralski Te-doped n-type GaSb wafers are commercially available. Vapor-based Zn diffusion is carried out at elevated temperatures ~450 ¬∞C to allow for p-type doping. Front and back electrical contacts are patterned using traditional photolithography techniques and an anti-reflective coating is deposited. Current efficiencies are estimated at ~20% using a 1000 ¬∞C black body spectrum. The radiative limit for efficiency of the GaSb cell in this setup is 52%, so vast improvements can still be made. Indium gallium arsenide antimonide Indium gallium arsenide antimonide (InGaAsSb) is a compound III-V semiconductor. (InxGa1‚àíxAsySb1‚àíy) The addition of GaAs allows for a narrower bandgap (0.5 to 0.6 eV), and therefore better absorption of long wavelengths. Specifically, the bandgap was engineered to 0.55 eV. With this bandgap, the compound achieved a photon-weighted internal quantum efficiency of 79% with a fill factor of 65% for a black body at 1100 ¬∞C. This was for a device grown on a GaSb substrate by organometallic vapour phase epitaxy (OMVPE). Devices have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of these devices are approaching 90%, while devices grown by the other two techniques exceed 95%. The largest problem with InGaAsSb cells is phase separation. Compositional inconsistencies throughout the device degrade its performance. When phase separation can be avoided, the IQE and fill factor of InGaAsSb approach theoretical limits in wavelength ranges near the bandgap energy. However, the Voc/Eg ratio is far from the ideal. Current methods to manufacture InGaAsSb PVs are expensive and not commercially viable. Indium gallium arsenide Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) is a compound III-V semiconductor. It can be applied in two ways for use in TPVs. When lattice- matched to an InP substrate, InGaAs has a bandgap of 0.74 eV, no better than GaSb. Devices of this configuration have been produced with a fill factor of 69% and an efficiency of 15%. However, to absorb higher wavelength photons, the bandgap may be engineered by changing the ratio of In to Ga. The range of bandgaps for this system is from about 0.4 to 1.4 eV. However, these different structures cause strain with the InP substrate. This can be controlled with graded layers of InGaAs with different compositions. This was done to develop of device with a quantum efficiency of 68% and a fill factor of 68%, grown by MBE. This device had a bandgap of 0.55 eV, achieved in the compound In0.68Ga0.33As. n has the advantage of being a well-developed material. InGaAs can be made to lattice match perfectly with Ge resulting in low defect densities. Ge as a substrate is a significant advantage over more expensive or harder-to-produce substrates. Indium phosphide arsenide antimonide The InPAsSb quaternary alloy has been grown by both OMVPE and LPE. When lattice- matched to InAs, it has a bandgap in the range 0.3‚Äì0.55 eV. The benefits of a TPV system with such a low band gap have not been studied in depth. Therefore, cells incorporating InPAsSb have not been optimized and do not yet have competitive performance. The longest spectral response from an InPAsSb cell studied was 4.3 Œºm with a maximum response at 3 Œºm. While this is a promising material, it has yet to be developed. For this and other low-bandgap materials, high IQE for long wavelengths is hard to achieve due to an increase in Auger recombination. Lead tin selenide/Lead strontium selenide quantum wells PbSnSe/PbSrSe quantum well materials, which can be grown by MBE on silicon substrates, have been proposed for low cost TPV device fabrication. These IV-VI semiconductor materials can have bandgaps between 0.3 and 0.6 eV. Their symmetric band structure and lack of valence band degeneracy result in low Auger recombination rates, typically more than an order of magnitude smaller than those of comparable bandgap III-V semiconductor materials. Applications  TPVs promise efficient and economically viable power systems for both military and commercial applications. Compared to traditional nonrenewable energy sources, burner TPVs have little NOx emissions and are virtually silent. Solar TPVs are a source of emission-free renewable energy. TPVs can be more efficient than PV systems owing to recycling of unabsorbed photons. However, TPVs are more complex and losses at each energy conversion step can lower efficiency. Further developments must be made to the absorber/emitter and PV cell. When TPVs are used with a burner source, they provide on-demand energy. As a result, energy storage is not needed. In addition, owing to the PV's proximity to the radiative source, TPVs can generate current densities 300 times that of conventional PVs. =Man-portable power= Battlefield dynamics require portable power. Conventional diesel generators are too heavy for use in the field. Scalability allows TPVs to be smaller and lighter than conventional generators. Also, TPVs have few emissions and are silent. Multifuel operation is another potential benefit. Early investigations into TPVs in the 1970s failed due to PV limitations. However, with the realization of the GaSb photocell, a renewed effort in the 1990s improved results. In early 2001, JX Crystals delivered a TPV based battery charger to the Army that produced an output of 230 W with propane. This prototype utilized an SiC emitter operating at 1250 ¬∞C and GaSb photocells and was approximately 0.5 m tall. The power source had an efficiency of 2.5%, calculated by the ratio of the power generated to the thermal energy of the fuel burned. This is too low for practical battlefield use. To increase efficiency, narrow-band emitters must be realized and the temperature of the burner must be raised. Further thermal management steps, such as water cooling or coolant boiling, must be implemented. Although many successful proof-of-concept prototypes were demonstrated, no portable TPV power sources have reached troop testing or battlefield implementation. =Spacecraft= For space travel power generation systems must provide consistent and reliable power without large amounts of fuel. As a result, solar and radioisotope fuels (extremely high power density and long lifetime) are ideal sources of energy. TPVs have been proposed for each. In the case of solar energy, orbital spacecraft may be better locations for the large and potentially cumbersome concentrators required for practical TPVs. However, because of weight considerations and inefficiencies associated with the somewhat more complicated design of TPVs, conventional PVs will almost surely be more effective for these applications. Probably more interesting is the prospect of using TPVs for conversion of radioisotope energy. The output of isotopes is thermal energy. In the past thermoelectricity (direct thermal to electrical conversion with no moving parts) has been used because of TPV efficiency is less than the ~10% of thermoelectric converters. Stirling engines have also been considered, but face reliability concerns, which are unacceptable for space missions, despite improved conversion efficiencies (>20%). However, with the recent advances in small-bandgap PVs, TPVs are becoming more promising candidates. A TPV radioisotope converter with 20% efficiency was demonstrated that uses a tungsten emitter heated to 1350 K, with tandem filters and a 0.6 eV bandgap InGaAs PV converter (cooled to room temperature). About 30% of the lost energy was due to the optical cavity and filters. The remainder was due to the efficiency of the PV converter. Low- temperature operation of the converter is critical to the efficiency of TPV. Heating PV converters increases their dark current, thereby reducing efficiency. The converter is heated by the radiation from the emitter. In terrestrial systems it is reasonable to dissipate this heat without using additional energy with a heat sink. However, space is an isolated system, where heat sinks are impractical. Therefore, it is critical to develop innovative solutions to efficiently remove that heat, or optimized TPV cells that can operate efficiently with higher temperature converters. Both represent substantial challenges. Despite this, TPVs offer substantial promise for use in future space applications. =Commercial applications= Off- grid generators Many homes are located in remote regions not connected to the power grid. Where available, power line extensions can be impractical. TPVs can provide a continuous supply of power in off-grid homes. Traditional PVs on the other hand, would not provide sufficient power during the winter months and nighttime, while TPVs can utilize alternative fuels to augment solar-only production. The greatest advantage for TPV generators is cogeneration of heat and power. In cold climates, it can function as both a heater or stove and a power generator. JX Crystals developed a prototype TPV heating stove and generator. It burns natural gas and uses a SiC source emitter operating at 1250 ¬∞C and GaSb photocell to output 25,000 BTU/hr simultaneously generating 100 W. However, costs must be significantly reduced to render it commercially viable. When a furnace is used as a heater and a generator, it is called combined heat and power (CHP). Many TPV CHP scenarios have been theorized, but a generator using boiling coolant was found most cost efficient. The proposed CHP would utilize a SiC IR emitter operating at 1425 ¬∞C and GaSb photocells cooled by boiling coolant. The TPV CHP would output 85,000 BTU/hr and generate 1.5 kW. The estimated efficiency would be 12.3% and the investment would be 0.08 ‚Ç¨/kWh provided that the lifetime of the CHP furnace is 20 years. The estimated cost of other non-TPV CHPs are 0.12 ‚Ç¨/kWh for gas engine CHP and 0.16 ‚Ç¨/kWh for fuel cell CHP. This proposed furnace has not been commercialized because the market was not thought to be large enough. Recreational vehicles TPVs have been proposed for use in recreational vehicles. With the advent of hybrid and other electrically powered vehicles, power generators with electrical outputs have become more interesting. In particular the versatility of TPVs for fuel choice and the ability to use multiple fuel sources makes them interesting as a wider variety of fuels are being with better sustainability are emerging. The silent operation of TPVs allow the generation of electricity when and where the use of noisy conventional generators is not allowed (i.e. during \\"quiet hours\\" in national park campgrounds), and do not disturb others. However, the emitter temperatures required for practical efficiencies make TPVs on this scale unlikely.

History Following the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870, Napoleon III (1808-1873), his wife Empress Eug√©nie (1826-1920) and their son the Prince Imperial (1856-1879) were exiled from France and took up residence at Camden Place in Chislehurst, England, where Napoleon III died in 1873. He was originally buried at St Mary's Catholic Church in Chislehurst, but, following the death of the Prince Imperial in 1879, the grief-stricken Empress Eug√©nie set about establishing a monument to her family. She founded the Abbey in 1881 as a mausoleum for her husband and son, wishing that the burial site should be a place of prayer and silence. The Abbey included an Imperial Crypt, modelled on the altar of St Louis in France, where the Emperor had originally desired to be buried. Empress Eug√©nie was later buried alongside her husband and son.

After the church and monastery were founded, they were initially administered by Premonstratensian Canons. In 1895, the Empress replaced them with French Benedictine monks from St Peter's Abbey, Solesmes. Fernand Cabrol, monk and scholar, became prior and afterwards abbot (1903); Henri Leclercq and a small group of French monks joined the house at the same time, and Leclercq and Cabrol collaborated for many years in scholarly endeavours. The church's present two-manual organ was installed in 1905, built by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll & Company. The instrument's origins are shrouded in mystery. Although installed after the death of Cavaill√©-Coll, it bears his name rather than that of his son-in-law Mutin, and the internal works are of a quality which identifies this model with the highest standards of workmanship of the high days of that company. The medievalist scholar Dom Andr√© Wilmart (1876-1941) was a liturgist at the abbey. The community, once famed for its scholarly writing and musical tradition of Gregorian chants, became depleted in number by 1947, and was augmented by a small group of English monks from Prinknash Abbey in Gloucestershire. The last French monk, Dom Zerr, died in 1956. In 2006, the community elected the first English Abbot of Farnborough‚Äîthe Right Reverend Dom Cuthbert Brogan. Catholic National Library The Catholic Central Library was set up by the Catholic Truth Society after the First World War. It was maintained for many years by the Graymoor Friars in Westminster until they were obliged to withdraw. It moved into the care of St Michael's Abbey in 2007 for a probationary period pending a final decision on its future. In 2007, it was renamed the Catholic National Library, and it is one of the finest collections of Catholic books in England. In 2015, the collection was relocated to Durham University Library.

Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank. In detail, the Horizontal blanking interval consists of: * front porch ‚Äì blank while still moving right, past the end of the scanline, * sync pulse ‚Äì blank while rapidly moving left; in terms of amplitude, \\"blacker than black\\". * back porch ‚Äì blank while moving right again, before the start of the next scanline. Colorburst occurs during the back porch, and unblanking happens at the end of the back porch. In the NTSC television standard, horizontal blanking occupies (17.2%) out of every scan line. In PAL, it occupies (18.8%) out of every scan line. In the PAL television standard, the blanking level corresponds to the black level, whilst other standards, most notably NTSC, set the black level slightly above the blanking level on a 'pedestal'.  HBlank effects  Some graphics systems can count horizontal blanks and change how the display is generated during this blank time in the signal; this is called a raster effect, of which an example are raster bars. In video games, the horizontal blanking interval was used to create some notable effects. Some methods of parallax scrolling use a raster effect to simulate depth in consoles that do not natively support multiple background layers or do not support enough background layers to achieve the desired effect. One example of this is in the game Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, which was written for the PC Engine CD-ROM which does not support multiple background layers. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System's Mode 7 uses the horizontal blanking interval to vary the scaling and rotation, per scan line, of one background layer to make the background appear to be a 3D plane.

He played 15 seasons of Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Detroit Tigers from 1912 to 1926. He was given the nickname \\"Hooks\\", because his curveball was hard to hit. He compiled a career record of 223‚Äì182 with a 3.30 earned run average (ERA). His best years were 1915 when he had a 24‚Äì13 record, 1919 with a 21‚Äì9 record, and 1923 with a 21‚Äì13 record. Dauss continues to hold the Detroit Tigers franchise record for most wins by a pitcher with 223. Early years Dauss was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1889. His parents were John Dauss, a machinist, and Anna E. (Magel) Dauss, a native of Indiana. He had two older brothers, Raymond and Edward. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he was living with his mother and grandparents at the time of the 1900 Census.Census Place: Center, Marion, Indiana; Roll: 389; Page: 4A; Enumeration District: 0111; FHL microfilm: 1240389. Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Dauss attended the Emmerich Manual High School in Indianapolis. Dauss first gained note as a pitcher on the Manual High School baseball team. Professional baseball career =Minors= Dauss began his professional baseball career in 1908 with the South Bend, Indiana team in the Central League. However, manager Aggie Grant released Dauss before he even appeared in a game. He did pitch an exhibition game, a shutout against the Duluth White Sox of the Northern League. Dauss then signed to play with Duluth in 1909. In his first full season of professional baseball, Dauss compiled a 19‚Äì10 record in 33 games. He appeared only 18 games for Duluth in 1910, compiling a 7‚Äì7 record. Dauss pitched for the Winona Pirates in the Class C Minnesota‚ÄìWisconsin League during the 1911 season. He compiled a 22‚Äì12 record and 2.13 earned run average (ERA) with Winona. Dauss was next acquired by the St. Paul Saints of the Class AA American Association. He compiled a 12‚Äì19 record for the Saints in 1912. =Detroit Tigers= 1912 to 1915 seasons Deacon McGuire, then a scout for the Detroit Tigers, saw Dauss pitch in St. Paul during the 1912 season. Detroit team president Frank Navin tried unsuccessfully to draft Dauss and ended up purchasing him from St. Paul in September 1912. Dauss made his major league debut on September 28, 1912, pitching a four-hit complete game victory over the Cleveland Naps despite giving up eight bases on balls and hitting three batsmen -- Shoeless Joe Jackson having been struck twice. Dauss compiled a 1‚Äì1 record and 3.18 ERA in his two appearances at the end of the Tigers 1912 season. In February 1913, Dauss signed a contract with the Tigers for the 1913 season. He became a regular in Detroit's starting rotation, a position he would hold for the next 14 years. In his first full season in the majors, Dauss started 29 games and compiled a 13‚Äì12 record, 2.48 ERA, 22 complete games, and 107 strikeouts. He also finished the 1913 season ranked ninth in the American League with a 7.5 hits per nine innings pitched. Eddie Onslow, who was a catcher for the Tigers in 1912 and 1913, said Dauss was \\"fast and had a good curve.\\" Detroit manager Hughie Jennings praised Dauss after the 1913 season: \\"I consider Dauss to be by far the best young pitcher in the American League and I am not alone in this belief. Clark Griffith, of the Nationals, was one of the first of opposing managers to recognize in Dauss a coming star.\\" Prior to the start of the 1914 season, Dauss and fellow Indianapolis native Donie Bush (Detroit's shortstop) were recruited to play as hometown talent for the Indianapolis team in the newly formed Federal League. In mid-January 1914, Dauss and Bush issued a joint statement that they had refused the Federal League offer and returned their signed contracts back to Detroit; both also indicated they had received increases in their 1913 salaries. During the 1914 season, Dauss became a workhorse for the Tigers, appearing in 45 games and 302 innings pitched. He improved his record to 19‚Äì15 and had a 2.86 ERA. He finished among the American League's leaders with 22 complete games (3rd), 19 wins (4th), 302 innings pitched (4th), and 150 strikeouts (5th). However, he also led the league with 98 earned runs allowed and 18 hit batsmen. Dauss actually hit three batters in one game on August 24, 1914. He and four Washington Senators pitchers combined to set a record with seven hit batsmen in a game: Dauss hit three, and Washington pitchers hit four. The Tigers won 11‚Äì0. In 1915, Hooks had the best season of his career, as the Tigers compiled a 100-54 record, narrowly losing the American League pennant to the Boston Red Sox. Dauss appeared in 46 games (309 innings) for the 1915 Tigers, compiling a 24‚Äì13 record with a 2.50 ERA. For the second consecutive season, Dauss was among the American League's leaders in multiple categories with 24 wins (2nd), 309 innings pitched (3rd), 27 complete games (3rd), and 132 strikeouts (8th). Dauss also developed into one of the best fielding pitchers in the game during the 1915 season. He led the league's pitchers with 137 assists and a range factor of 4.30 per nine innings pitched. In a display of dedication to baseball, Dauss was married to Miss Ollie Speake in the morning of May 29, 1915, asked the clerk to delay making an entry in his books, and insisted that the Justice place newspapers over the windows in his office during the ceremony. Dauss then pitched for the Tigers that afternoon, explaining his zest for privacy on the ground that he thought he would be nervous if the crowd knew he had just been married. 1916 to 1919 seasons During the 1916 season, Dauss's ERA jumped nearly a full point to 3.21 (from 2.50 the prior year). His playing time was reduced somewhat to 238 innings pitched, but he still compiled a solid 19-12 record, and his 19 wins was fifth best in the American League. As he had in 1914, Dauss again led the league with 16 hit batsmen in 1916. During spring training in 1917, Dauss's performance raised concerns. Sports writer E. A. Batchelor wrote: > \\"There is no use trying to dodge the somber truth, Dauss does not look good. > Now and then he has shown his famous curve with as quick a break as it ever > had, but he hasn't had a fast ball that would dent a felt hat.\\" Despite the concerns expressed in the spring, Dauss brought his ERA down to 2.43 in 1917 and won 17 games‚Äîthe seventh highest tally in the American League. During spring training in 1918, Detroit manager Hughie Jennings opined that lack of confidence and a \\"carefree manner\\" was holding Dauss back from stardom. The Detroit Free Press reported: > \\"Were George Dauss possessed of the proper spirit, it is Manager Jennings's > profound belief that the little curver would take rank with the greatest > hurlers that ever sunk a spiked shoe in the rubber of a major league > pitching mound. . . . Nothing appears to ruffle Dauss; he takes a victory or > defeat with the same measure of unconcern . .

'If George could only say to > himself, now I am as good as Mathewson, he would be the best pitcher in the > major leagues today. . . . There isn't anything any other pitcher ever had > that George has not got,' Hughie mused, 'but confidence in himself. Half the > battle is self assurance.'\\" Dauss went on to compile his first losing record (12‚Äì16) in his major league career. However, Dauss's 1918 record was more a reflection of the collapse of the Detroit team as a whole. After winning 100 games in 1915, the 1918 team compiled a 55-71 record and finished seventh in American League. In 1919, Dauss rebounded and had his second 20-win season in the major leagues. Despite playing for a fourth place team, Dauss compiled a 21‚Äì9 for a career best .700 winning percentage. He ranked among the league leaders with 21 wins (4th), 22 complete games (7th), and 256 innings pitched (10th). He also posted impressive fielding numbers, leading the league's pitchers with 101 assists. 1920 to 1922 seasons 1922 to 1926 seasons On September 10, 1925, in the first game of a doubleheader, Dauss and the Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians, 6-1; this gave Dauss his 210th win in a Detroit uniform, surpassing George Mullin's 209. Dauss has held the Tigers record for pitcher wins ever since: 95 years as of 2020. He is likely to retain this record for some time to come, unless Justin Verlander (who was traded to the Houston Astros in 2017) returns to Detroit. (Verlander has 183 wins as a Tiger, 40 shy of Dauss; Matthew Boyd's 30 wins as a Tiger is currently the most among pitchers on the Detroit roster in 2020.) Career totals/records Dauss finished his career with a record of 223‚Äì182 and a 3.30 ERA in 538 games (388 starts). Dauss also has career totals of 1,201 strike outs and 3,390 innings pitched. As a batter, he compiled a .189 batting average. Dauss was also an excellent fielding pitcher, with a career range factor of 2.28, 65 points higher than the average pitcher of his era. His career total of 1,128 assists as a pitcher ranks 14th in major league history. His career fielding percentage of .967 was also 19 points higher than the average pitcher of his era. In the combined 1923 and 1924 seasons, Dauss was charged with only one error in 90 games. Family and later years Dauss was married in May 1915 to Ollie Speake of St. Louis.Application by George A.

Mariner Richard was the youngest son of Rev. Foote Gower, physician and antiquarian, and Elizabeth, a sister of John Strutt, Member of Parliament for . He won a scholarship to Winchester College. He left school, \\"thankfully\\", to join the British East India Company as a midshipman in the vessel Essex carrying troops and invalids. He was a lively and observant lad. At the age of 16 he was promoted captain of the main top, where he waged active war with the lads of the fore top, shrouds and stays providing the high roads of communication. He was noted for his spirit and ingenuity, his depth of knowledge of his ship and his skill as a ship model maker; unravelling stockings to obtain rigging materials. When he returned to England after his first three-year voyage, he studied navigation at Edmonton and, on rejoining ship, was dubbed \\"the young philosopher\\". Ever inventive, he once fitted a canvas speaking tube from the main top to the deck, installing it overnight to surprise and please his captain. To his bitter dismay, his captain had it removed instantly saying he was sure the topmen would \\"use it for an improper purpose\\". Gower rose to chief mate of the Essex and qualified as a captain. He returned to shore in 1783 to teach at Edmonton and to publish his Practical Guide that eventually went into at least three editions. He designed, and applied for a patent for a Ship's log very similar to the logs employed to this day. He turned down the offer of the command of an East Indiaman to make ship models and to pursue his interest in naval architecture and in the, then much needed, improvement of ship design. Empirical Philosopher The Age of Reason and the Industrial Revolution had brought experimental enquiry, scientific reasoning and, thus, engineering to bear on the legends, traditions and practices of all the crafts. Naval architects and shipwrights were no exceptions. Richard Gower quoted a Mr Mackonochie \\" ... in a mechanical point of view (a ship) is the feeblest, most inartificial, and unworkmanlike structure in the whole range of mechanics\\". Gower continued to the effect that almost any vessel, however badly it may sail, would probably get there in the end, if the wind and weather be fair. That, he thought, was not nearly good enough. He was among the first to bring empirical science to bear on naval architecture. His intention was to so improve ship design that, in whatever wind and weather, vessels would sail safely, speedily and economically with a crew properly accommodated and put to no unnecessary risk. Traditionally, the design of hulls, rigging, sails and outfittings had been the provinces of several separate specialists. Commonly, shipyards built the hulls of vessels and, after launching, riggers and sailmakers outfitted them. Most innovation was confined to improvement of the hull, to increase carrying capacity of merchantmen and to improve the stability of warships as gun platforms. The results were broad, squat boxes, hydrodynamically inefficient, with squalid accommodation for the crew and complicated rigging that entailed much very dangerous work aloft. It was just about the turn of the century that both the Royal Navy and the Royal Mail recognised the need for fast vessels for scouting and for carrying messages and mail to and from the United Kingdom and her dominions and colonies overseas. These newly recognised tasks required new designs of vessels and new opportunities for invention. Gower was among those who saw a vessel as a single entity in which all the parts, hull, rigging, sails and, in Gower's view, the crew, should relate to each other in ways appropriate to the task to be performed. This entailed giving greater consideration to designing the vessel as a whole, rather than leaving it to the various crafts to perform their respective works as best they could. Today, we would call his approach \\"holistic\\". By this time, to be successful, innovations had to be well founded in good science, properly protected against plagiarism by letters patent and backed by the Crown, government, patrons or merchant venturers. So Gower defended most of his ideas with an applications for patents, in which he expounded the physical theories he believed supported his innovations as well as describing the matters which he claimed to be original inventions. He then sought every opportunity of stalking the corridors of power and seeking contacts in high places. He proposed no innovation that did not make sound military or commercial sense. Inventor Gower and his family removed to Nova Scotia House at Ipswich in 1817. There he devoted himself to the invention, patenting, design and building of a remarkable series of novel vessels including three vessels named Transit, a fly boat, two yachts the Unique and the Gower, the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, and a number of other inventions. He entered, but did not win, a competition for a novel form of lock for the Regents Canal. He suggested that, to protect coastal traffic, cruisers be stationed along the coast in communication with signal stations to provide a concerted defence system. He proposed a form of vertical-vaned windmill; an eye shade; various ship's logs and a \\"double- barrelled\\" capstan to do two jobs at once. He suggested a non-elastic substitute for imported hempen standing rigging to be made of wooden cylinders joined together by iron straps. He devised a method of keeping ships at proper distances by using the mast as a base line. He invented a mode of dropping a guess warp anchor with such accuracy that its end could be easily found and lifted. He devised a novel method of fidding a topgallant mast and several contrivances for the \\"better nipping and stopping a cable\\". He designed a long catamaran for forming a life raft and a form of floating sea anchor, or drogue anchor (he called it a \\"propeller\\") like an umbrella. He created a set of signals, that could be seen from all angles, using shapes instead of flags. He also suggested using a floating compass needle to find North. He experimented with various designs of paddle wheel on the River Lee Canal that anticipated the design of the wheels used by steam paddlers many years later. He invented and built the Landguard Fort Lifeboat, which carried up to 25 people and was virtually unsinkable. He proposed fitting canal barges with 'spud wheels' that could propel the vessel by catching on the canal bottom. He saw that a combination of paddle wheels and spud wheels could take vessels over mud flats at various conditions of the tide. Gower also constructed a twin hulled catamaran, just ten feet long, on which he mounted a barrel of water that drained to underwater by a curved pipe pointing aft. His twin floats achieved two miles per hour apparently without the need for power from sail or steam. He thus demonstrated water jet propulsion. He anticipated that a steam water pump, so contrived, could propel vessels without the need for paddles. He gives credit to Dr Franklin (probably Benjamin Franklin) and a Mr Rumsay of Philadelphia for this idea and hoped that his little experiment would encourage others to pursue the notion. Entrepreneur The design, building and sailing of the vessels Transit and the promotion of the novel ideas that he incorporated in them, occupied much of his life. The most original features of these vessels were their slab sides above, and the concave and convex sweeps of the hull, below the waterline, the Joints scarfed and bolted rather than chocked and treenailed, ballast was iron cast into special shapes to sit just above the deadwood and between the floor timbers and the narrowest part of the hull above the keel was reinforced by strong cross timbers bolted through the sides. Such extensive use of iron was a novel feature at the time. Gower observed that conventional vessels were box-like and needed much movement of the rudder from side to side to preserve a steady course. When running fast, they often suffered total loss of steerage because the water failed \\"to close over the rudder\\" and left it in a \\"mere hole or vacuum in the water\\" (what we now call \\"cavitation\\"). He appreciated too that drag is proportionate to the wetted surface of the hull, and that a long narrow hull with a deep narrow keel makes for speed. In the case of the Transit, the tapering lines also allowed the rudder to hang abaft the general spread of the bottom. This \\"enlivened\\" the steering; yet the rudder was not vulnerable to damage when the vessel grounded. Except when she was to put about, a spoke of the helm either way could steer the Transit. Several attempts to arouse the interest of the Hon. East India Company and the Royal Mail. These failed, and the Transit loaded cargo and sailed to join convoy in June 1801. While waiting for the convoy to assemble, Gower, ever the salesman, showed her off to the King and his party on the Royal Yacht in Christchurch Bay. Gower learned later that, although George III had asked many questions about the Transit, none present had been able to answer him and none thought to ask the inventor who was nearby. Later the Chairman of the Hon. East India Company summoned Gower to a meeting. Gower says that the chairman said that the Company would buy the Transit, provided she proved to be a fast-sailing vessel. At the instance of Earl St Vincent, now the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Transit was tried against Osprey. She was a fast sloop of 383 tons (about twice the tonnage of the Transit) and, according to Gower, the commander of Osprey was generous in his praise. To Gower's chagrin, no order was forthcoming and he had to re-ship his cargo and join convoy for Lisbon on 27 August. The important question of what happened to change the decision of the Company is, as yet, unresolved. Perhaps Gower put a gloss on the intention of the Chairman of the Company or on the opinion of Osprey's captain. Perhaps someone in the Admiralty tampered with Osprey's report before forwarding it to the Company. Perhaps there was some aspect of the design of the Transit, say her problems in shallow tidal harbours, or the strange way of her sailing, that killed off the Company's enthusiasm. Maybe there is still a note in some archive that could tell us why the Transit did not become the first of a new generation of fast traders. Humanitarian Captain Gower was a regular contributor, mainly on nautical subjects, to the Suffolk Chronicle under the initials R. G. or \\"John Splice\\". He expressed much concern about the cramped and squalid conditions under which Jack Tar had to work and he deplored the cruel and heartless behaviour of many captains. His concern for the plight of the labouring classes extended to that of agricultural labourers. He applauded the formation of the East Sussex Agricultural Association and, in supporting it, criticised the poor quality of local builders, comparing them very unfavourably with Italian house builders. He cited in evidence draughty walls, leaky chimneys, insecure joists and the general paucity of decoration. He inveighed against crown glass, small window panes and the window tax. He described how plate glass was made in Italy and hoped that it would soon be made in Britain also. His last letters expressed his concern about the hardships of sailor boys, the reasons for the mutinies in the Navy and the perils of convoy. He gave a vivid description of traditional Naval punishments. He thought that these cruelties, so readily meted out to sailors just for disobedience, would be better applied to those on land who ill-treat, forge, rob and plunder the peaceable inhabitants of the country. His last article appeared on 18 May 1833 and addressed, among a number of topics, uselessness of our \\"colossal three-deckers\\". Twelve of these at anchor may be a stately sight, but what good is it to incarcerate 10,000 seamen in them for ten to fifteen years at a time? He concluded \\"Our colossal Navy is merely an object of magnificence, and show of power, without opposition in the present state of Europe\\". His words do have a certain resonance today. In his last book, published posthumously, Gower reflected on the gigantic advances made in the use of iron and steam. He noted this especially on the railroads where passengers and heavy freight travelled at the extraordinary velocity of thirty miles per hour. He thought that, because of the need for large coal bunkers, 'steam paddlers' were unlikely to replace sail on long trade routes such as the trans-Atlantic crossing. He hoped that vessels of the Transit type would ply across the Ocean until \\"more portable means shall be invented for putting steamers in motion\\". Just five years later SS Sirius and Brunel's SS Great Western crossed the Atlantic under steam power alone. Gower was correct in pointing to the need for large bunkers, the former vessel had to burn furniture and fittings to complete her record-breaking voyage, while the latter arrived a day later with 200 tons still in her bunkers. He died, aged 65, on his estate 'Nova Scotia' near Ipswich in July 1833. He left a widow, two sons and three daughters whom, because of his abhorrence of public schools, he had been teaching by his own peculiar methods. He lies in a vault on the North side of the church of St Mary Stoke, Ipswich, in the company of Master Mariners, shipwrights and men of the sea. A stern disciplinarian, honest and guileless, Gower was \\"not free from the irritability of genius\\". He had at heart two passions; for the improvement of sailing vessels and the betterment of the lot of the common sailor. A Memoir about him concludes \\"Of him it may with truth be said that by those who knew him best, he was beloved the most; and if the motto Palmam qui meruit ferat (Let he, who has won the palm, wear it) had been verified, the laurels that now shade others heads would have crowned the temples of Richard Hall Gower.‚Äù Family Life In 1803 Richard married Elizabeth Emptage (1773-1840), daughter of Commodore George Emptage, who had an inheritance of 32,000 Bombay Rupees.

Courses in Advanced Placement follow an approved curriculum that leads to the equivalent of a university credit from participating universities. * Bluevale's \\"Choose to Lead\\" program is offered to incoming Grade 9 students whose home school is in the Bluevale community and who successfully complete the application and screening processes. * OYAP (Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program) * Co-op: students can choose from a variety of placements in many different employment settings * German * Spanish * Computer Science Programs * Photography * Arts programs such as Dramatic Arts, Vocal and Instrumental Music, and Visual Arts Extracurricular programs =Sports= Bluevale provides opportunities for participation in athletics including intramurals, team sports and individual- based programs. These opportunities include rugby, football, basketball, volleyball, swimming, tennis, track and field, cross-country, curling, skiing, hockey, badminton and other teams. The school participates in WCSSAA (Waterloo County Secondary School Athletic Association). Many BCI teams have won WCSSAA and CWOSSA (Central Western Ontario Secondary School Association) titles and have performed well at the Provincial level, including most recently the cross-country teams, swim team, basketball and volleyball squads. The Senior Boys and Girls Rugby teams both won WCCSSA championships in 2013. The Senior girls rugby team then placed in the top ten in all-Ontario competition. The BCI girls' field hockey team have won two consecutive OFSAA (Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations) championships (2016 and 2017) while also medalling in the 2014 and 2015 campaigns. =Arts programs= The school's arts program offers Music, Dance, and Visual Arts. In addition, there are two different choirs, two bands, and some small ensembles. The main choir (Bluevale Singers) had over 100 members in 2013. The music program features instrumental, vocal and guitar courses. In 2003, Bluevale hosted the first annual provincial \\"DanceFest\\", a competition and showcase for dance teams from schools across Ontario to celebrate student choreography and collaboration through workshops, performance and professional adjudication. In 2015, Ontario Secondary School DANCEFEST became a Not-for-Profit organization providing knowledge, creativity and educational development to more than 450 student dancers, teachers and dance professionals at their provincial event in Niagara Falls at the Scotiabank Convention Centre. Drama students perform at the National Theatre School Drama Festival (formerly the Sears Drama Festival) competitions each year and in their annual Fall Showcase. The Visual Arts program provides many opportunities for students to challenge their creativity though works of art using many mediums. Opportunities to showcase their work are provided in a variety of displays throughout the school year. =Other clubs= Like other schools in the region, Bluevale consistently has a high extracurricular participation rate, due to Students Council (also known as KRT - Knights of the Round Table) and the large number of clubs at the school. From business competitions (DECA - Distributive Education Clubs of America) to Fishing Club to the Environment Club, the school offers opportunities for personal growth through various staff and student-run activities. The school often partners with other high schools in the region for special events such as Relay for Life, an event that raises money for cancer research.

Aquascape designs include a number of distinct styles, including the garden-like Dutch style and the Japanese-inspired nature style. Typically, an aquascape houses fish as well as plants, although it is possible to create an aquascape with plants only, or with rockwork or other hardscape and no plants. Many aquarists believe that the art of aquascaping began in the 1930s in the Netherlands following the introduction of the Dutch style aquascaping techniques. With the increasing availability of mass-produced freshwater fish keeping products and popularity of fish keeping following the First World War, many artists began exploring the new possibilities of creating an aquarium that didn‚Äôt have fish as the main attraction. Although the primary aim of aquascaping is to create an artful underwater landscape, the technical aspects of tank maintenance and the growth requirements of aquatic plants are also taken into consideration. Many factors must be balanced in the closed system of an aquarium tank to ensure the success of an aquascape. These factors include filtration, maintaining carbon dioxide at levels sufficient to support photosynthesis underwater, substrate and fertilization, lighting, and algae control. Aquascape hobbyists trade plants, conduct contests, and share photographs and information via the Internet. The United States-based Aquatic Gardeners Association has about 1,200 members.  Designs  = Dutch style = Dutch style aquascape The Dutch aquarium employs a lush arrangement in which multiple types of plants having diverse leaf colors, sizes, and textures are displayed much as terrestrial plants are shown in a flower garden. This style was developed in the Netherlands starting in the 1930s, as freshwater aquarium equipment became commercially available. It emphasizes plants located on terraces of different heights, and frequently omits rocks and driftwood. Linear rows of plants running left-to-right are referred to as \\"Dutch streets\\".Hudson, Robert Paul (30 May 2008), Going Dutch . Although many plant types are used, one typically sees neatly trimmed groupings of plants with fine, feathery foliage, such as Limnophila aquatica and various types of Hygrophila, along with the use of red-leaved Alternanthera reineckii, Ammania gracilis, and assorted Rotala for color highlights. More than 80% of the aquarium floor is covered with plants, and little or no substrate is left visible. Tall growing plants that cover the back glass originally served the purpose of hiding bulky equipment behind the tank.Hennig, Matt (June 2003), Amano versus Dutch: Two art forms in profile, Tropical Fish Hobbyist, pp. 68-74. = Japanese styles =  Nature style  A nature style aquascape, suggesting mountains A contrasting approach is the \\"nature aquarium\\" or Japanese style, introduced in the 1990s by Takashi Amano. Amano's three-volume series, Nature Aquarium World, sparked a wave of interest in aquarium gardening, and he has been cited as having \\"set a new standard in aquarium management\\".Axelrod, Herbert R., Warren E. Burgess, Neal Pronek, Glen S. Axelrod and David E. Boruchowitz (1998), Aquarium Fishes of the World, Neptune City, N.J.: T.F.H. Publications, p. 718, . Amano's compositions drew on Japanese gardening techniques that attempt to mimic natural landscapes by the asymmetrical arrangement of masses of relatively few species of plants, and which set rules governing carefully selected stones or driftwood, usually with a single focal point. The objective is to evoke a terrestrial landscape in miniature, rather than a colourful garden. This style draws particularly from the Japanese aesthetic concepts of , which focuses on transience and minimalism as sources of beauty. Plants with small leaves like Glossostigma elatinoides, Eleocharis acicularis, Eleocharis parvula, Echinodorus tenellus, Hemianthus callitrichoides, Riccia fluitans, small aquatic ferns, Staurogyne repens, and Java moss (Versicularia dubyana or Taxiphyllum barbieri) are often used to emulate grass or moss. Colours are more limited than in the Dutch style, and the hardscape is not completely covered. Fish, or freshwater shrimp such as Caridina multidentata and Neocaridina davidi, are usually selected to complement the plants and control algae, but for reasons of minimalism the number of species are often limited.The Nature Aquarium Style, 8 January 2014. Iwagumi style Iwagumi style aquascape, with the Oyaishi stone at the right The Iwagumi style is a specific subtype of the nature style. The term itself comes from the Japanese \\"rock formation\\" and refers to a layout where stones play a leading role.\\"Iwagumi and Sanzon Iwagumi Aquariums,\\" Aquatic Eden website, 11 February 2007. In the Iwagumi style, each stone has a name and a specific role. Rocks provide the bony structure of the aquascape and the typical geometry employs a design with three main stones, with one larger stone and two other smaller stones, although additional rocks can also be used.The Iwagumi Layout: An Introduction, 7 January 2014 The , or main stone, is placed slightly off-center in the tank, and , or accompanying stones, are grouped near it, while , or secondary stones, are arranged in subordinate positions.Amano, Takashi (2009), How to improve your Iwagumi layout, The Aquatic Gardener, vol. 22, number 1, pp. 37-41. The location of the focal point of the display, determined largely by the asymmetric placement of the Oyaishi, is considered important, and follows ratios that reflect Pythagorean tuning.\\"The Golden Rule of Aquascaping,\\" Aquatic Eden website, 16 November 2006. =Jungle style= Jungle style aquascape Some hobbyists also refer to a \\"jungle\\" (or \\"wild jungle\\") style, separate from either the Dutch or nature styles, and incorporating some of the features of them both. The plants are left to assume a natural, untrimmed look. Jungle style aquascapes usually have little or no visible hardscape material, as well as limited open space. Bold, coarser leaf shapes, such as Echinodorus bleheri, are used to provide a wild, untamed appearance. Unlike nature syle, the jungle style does not follow clean lines, or employ fine textures. A jungle canopy effect can be obtained using combinations of darker substrates, tall plants growing up to the surface, and floating plants that block light, offering a dappled lighting effect. Other plants used in jungle style aquascapes include Microsorum pteropus, Bolbitis heudelotii, Vallisneria americana, Crinum species, Aponogeton species, Echinodorus species, Sagittaria subulata, Hygrophila pinnatifida, Anubias species, and Limnobium laevigatum. = Biotopes = This Lake Malawi biotope with cichlids is an exhibit of Artis, a zoo in Amsterdam. Note the absence of green plants in this rift lake habitat. The styles above often combine plant and animal species based on the desired visual impact, without regard to geographic origin. Biotope aquariums are designed instead to replicate exactly a particular aquatic habitat at a particular geographic location, and not necessarily to provide a gardenlike display. Plants and fish need not be present at all, but if they are, they must match what would be found in nature in the habitat being represented, as must any gravel and hardscape, and even the chemical composition of the water. By including only those organisms that naturally exist together, biotopes can be used to study ecological interactions in a relatively natural setting..\\"Biotope Aquaria,\\" Mongabay.com, 7 December 2004. = Paludariums = A paludarium A paludarium is an aquarium that combines water and land inside the same environment. These designs can represent habitats including tropical rainforests, jungles, riverbanks, bogs, or even the beach.Paludariums: Discover Water Garden Terrariums! In a paludarium, part of the aquarium is underwater, and part is above water. Substrate is built up so that some \\"land\\" regions are raised above the waterline, and the tank is only partially filled with water. This allows plants, such as Cyperus alternifolius and Spathiphyllum wallisii, as well as various Anubias and some bromeliads, to grow emersed, with their roots underwater but their tops in the air, as well as completely submersed. In some configurations, plants that float on the surface of the water, such as Eichhornia crassipes and Pistia stratiotes, can be displayed to full advantage. Unlike other aquarium setups, paludariums are particularly well- suited to keeping amphibians.Paludariums.net. = Saltwater reefs = Reef aquascape Dutch and nature style aquascapes are traditionally freshwater systems. In contrast, relatively few ornamental plants can be grown in a saltwater aquarium. Saltwater aquascaping typically centers, instead, on mimicking a reef. An arrangement of live rock forms the main structure of this aquascape, and it is populated by corals and other marine invertebrates as well as coralline algae and macroalgae, which together serve much the same aesthetic role as freshwater plants.Michael, Scott W. (November 2006), Aquascaping reef habitats, Aquarium Fish Magazine, pp. 66-73. Lighting plays a particularly significant role in the reef aquascape. Many corals, as well as tridacnid clams, contain symbiotic fluorescent algae-like dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae.. By providing intense lighting supplemented in the ultraviolet wavelengths, reef aquarists not only support the health of these invertebrates, but also elicit particularly bright colors emitted by the fluorescent microorganisms.. Techniques From the Victorian era, aquarists have planted their tanks, as seen in this 1856 example containing Vallisneria spiralis. In addition to design, freshwater aquascaping also requires specific methods to maintain healthy plants underwater. Plants are often trimmed to obtain the desired shape, and they can be positioned by tying them in place inconspicuously with thread.Amano, Takashi (2008), Nature aquarium techniques to create & maintain an aquascape, The Aquatic Gardener, vol. 21, number 2, pp. 8-17.Turon, Lluis Ruscalleda (2009), How to use Riccia and Java moss in the aquarium, The Aquatic Gardener, vol. 22, number 4, pp. 11-13. Most serious aquascapers use aquarium-safe fertilizers, commonly in liquid or tablet form, to help the plants fill out more rapidly.. Some aquarium substrates containing laterite also provide nutrients.. It is also necessary to support photosynthesis, by providing light and carbon dioxide. A variety of lighting systems may be used to produce the full spectrum of light, usually at 2-4 watts per gallon (0.5-1 watts per litre). Lights are usually controlled by a timer that allows the plants to be acclimated to a set cycle.. Depending on the number of plants and fish, the aquascape may also require carbon dioxide supplementation. This can be accomplished with a simple homemade system, using a soda bottle filled with yeast, warm water, and sugar, and connected to an airstone in the aquarium, or with a pressurized CO2 tank that injects a set amount of carbon dioxide into the aquarium water..Nyberg, Tarah (2003), Yeast CO2 , (Retrieved 10 October 2009). Aquascape evoking an overgrown cave and decaying trees Algae (including cyanobacteria, as well as true algae) is considered distracting and unwanted in aquascaping, and is controlled in several ways. One is the use of animals that consume algae, such as some fish (notably cyprinids of the genera Crossocheilus and Gyrinocheilus, and catfish of the genera Ancistrus, Hypostomus, and Otocinclus), shrimp, or snails, to clean the algae that collects on the leaves. A second is using adequate light and CO2 to promote rapid growth of desired plants, while controlling nutrient levels, to ensure that the plants utilize all fertilizer without leaving nutrients to support algae.. Although serious aquascapers often use a considerable amount of equipment to provide lighting, filtration, and CO2 supplementation to the tank, some hobbyists choose instead to maintain plants with a minimum of technology, and some have reported success in producing lush plant growth this way.Lass, David A. (March 2009), Three tough planted tanks, Aquarium Fish International, pp. 30-37. This approach, sometimes called the \\"natural planted tank\\" and popularized by Diana Walstad, can include the use of soil in place of aquarium gravel, the elimination of CO2 apparatus and most filtration, and limited lighting. Instead, only a few fish are kept, to limit the quantity of fish waste, and the plants themselves are used to perform the water-cleansing role typically played by aquarium filters, by utilizing what fish waste there is as fertilizer.Walstad, Diana (2003), Ecology of the planted aquarium: a practical manual and scientific treatise for the home aquarist, 2nd edition, Ashland Ohio: Atlas Books, .  Contests  Early Dutch hobbyists began the practice of aquascape contests, with over 100 local clubs. Judges had to go through about three years of training and pass examinations in multiple disciplines in order to qualify. This competition continues to be held every year, under the auspices of the National Aquarium Society. There are three rounds, beginning with contests in local clubs. First-place local winners are entered in the second round, held in fifteen districtkeuring (districts). The winners at that level are then entered in the third round, which is the national championship. In the Dutch contest, the focus is not only on composition, but also on the biological well-being of the aquarium's inhabitants. Most points are, in fact, awarded for such biological criteria as fish health, plant health, and water quality. Unlike contests in other countries, the judges travel to each contestant's home to evaluate the tank, where they measure the water parameters themselves. The Aquatic Gardeners Association, based in the United States, Aqua Design Amano, based in Japan, and AquaticScapers Europe, based in Germany, also conduct annual freshwater aquascaping contests. Entries from around the world are submitted as photographs and explanatory text online. The Aquatic Gardeners Association contest is judged based on: :*overall impression (35 points), :*composition, balance, use of space and use of color (30 points), :*selection and use of materials (20 points), and :*viability of aquascape (15 points). There are also smaller contests conducted by Acuavida in Spain, by the Greek Aquarist's Board, and by the French association Aquagora.  Public aquariums  Discus and cardinal tetras in an Amazon River basin display at the Palais de la Porte Dor√©e aquarium in Paris Large public aquariums sometimes use aquascaping as part of their displays. As early as the 1920s, the New York Aquarium included a moray eel display tank that was decorated with calcareous tufa rock, arranged to resemble a coral reef, and supporting some stony corals and sea fans.Townsend, Charles Haskins (1922, reprinted 2004), The Public Aquarium: Its Construction, Equipment, and Management, Honolulu: University Press of the Pacific, p. 17, . Because they typically present wildlife from a particular habitat, modern day displays are often created to be biologically accurate biotopes.Buckley, Kate (2010), Planted aquaria for zoological parks, The Aquatic Gardener, vol. 23, number 4, pp. 5‚Äì20.

The character was created by Scott Lobdell and Pascual Ferry and first made a cameo appearance in X-Men #52 (May 1996) while his first full appearance was in Uncanny X-Men #333 (June 1996). Fictional character biography =Operation: Zero Tolerance= Bastion is a mysterious man named Sebastion Gilberti who had risen to power in a relatively short time in the U.S. Government and began assembling the international anti-mutant strike force Operation: Zero Tolerance (OZT). When the X-Men learned about the existence of OZT some months before the operation became public, Gambit and Phoenix, acting on information, snuck into an OZT meeting being held at the Pentagon to learn more about the program and its leader Bastion, but did not come out with much. Bastion showed that he was more than met the eye as Phoenix could not read his mind and Bastion easily identified the two X-Men hidden among representatives of various foreign intelligence agencies interested in supporting OZT.Uncanny X-Men #333 When Professor X voluntarily turned himself in after the Onslaught event, Bastion confined him in an OZT facility along with the artificially-created mutant Mannites which, it was later revealed, allowed Bastion to take direct control over the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. It also allowed Bastion to gain possession of the Xavier Protocols, a list of files containing information on killing the X-Men. Bastion also killed a Daily Bugle reporter named Nick Bandouveris, who was going to report on Graydon Creed's historyUncanny X-Men #339 and later Bastion himself succeeded in capturing Jubilee and taking her to the OZT base in New Mexico.Generation X #27 As the OZT attempted to reconfigure the Sentinel force assembled by Project: Wideawake, Bastion deemed most of them outdated. Instead, Bastion was able to develop a new type of Sentinel, the Prime Sentinels. Graydon's deathX-Factor (1st series) #130 was the last ammunition needed to initiate Bastion's OZT, which attacked mutants everywhere. The operation soon targeted and succeeded in capturing some members of the X-Men.X-Men (2nd series) #65 Bastion also tries to buy off J. Jonah Jameson directly with all the available information he has managed to gather and decrypt on the outlaw X-Men and their associates. However, Jameson reveals that he has already been working on his own story for quite some time and invites Bastion to see what he has so far. When Bastion sees nothing, Jameson points out that Bastion has managed to ingratiate, intimidate, and dominate his way into a position of power in over a dozen countries. Yet there is no evidence of his existence. To Jameson, this means the greatest story to follow is Bastion himself. He also implies that Bastion was behind the disappearance of Nick Bandouveris and this means Bastion would kill to keep his secrets. Jameson then burns the data disk and orders Bastion out of his office and warns that he will see him charged with Nick's murder.Uncanny X-Men #346 After learning the nature of the Prime Sentinels, the President was convinced by Senator Robert Kelly and Henry Peter Gyrich to suspend Bastion's operations. Bastion was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., with help from Iceman. =Origin= While in government custody, more mysteries surrounding Bastion were discovered, but before a further investigation could be made, Bastion managed to escape and returned to the home of his mother figure, Rose Gilberti. However, she is accidentally killed by the authorities which sends Bastion into a rage and returns to the former OZT facility where Cable is fighting Machine Man, who‚Äôs lost touch with his humanity. Bastion makes contact with the Master Mold unit which he had created the Prime Sentinels. Master Mold is drained of its energy as Bastion is transformed into a Nimrod unit.Cable/Machine Man Annual #'98 Being transformed, allowed Bastion‚Äôs memories to be unblocked in the process and as it turns out Bastion had not been born human at all but started life out as two separate beings: the Sentinel Master Mold, and the highly advanced Sentinel Nimrod from an alternate future. While posing as a human construction worker, Nimrod unearthed a module from Master Mold. As soon as Nimrod made physical contact with the module, Master Mold's programming began to co-opt Nimrod's. Shortly after, during a conflict with the X-Men, the two of them, along with the X-Man Rogue, were blasted through the Siege Perilous, a mystical crystal capable of judging any who pass through it and reincarnating them into a new life commensurate in quality with their previous life. It was the Siege Perilous that was responsible for merging Nimrod and Master Mold into a single being with no memory of his past. Bastion was eventually found by Rose Gilberti who took him in and taught him human kindness. However, unbeknown to him, when Bastion began to hear about America's mutant problem, his mutant-termination directives were re-activated. He abandoned Rose and sought out high-profile mutant critic, Graydon Creed, and his Friends of Humanity. After regaining its identity as a Sentinel, Bastion attempts to lead another crusade against mutants by turning Machine Man into a Sentinel Supreme, but Machine Man and Cable were able to defeat him.Machine Man/Bastion Annual #'98 He was returned to government custody, only to be beheaded later by Apocalypse's Horseman of Death.Astonishing X-Men (Vol. 2) #1 =Template= Bastion's remains were eventually found by a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Mainspring who headed a project called the Gatekeepers, whose goal is to study and destroy Phalanx technology. Bastion was, however, able to co-opt and integrate itself with one of the Gatekeeper's bodies and used it to attack the techno-organic hero Warlock and his allies, being eventually defeated.Warlock #6 Mainspring was able to strip away the layers of Bastion's programming to reveal the original Master Mold's source code and, using the alien transmode virus he was infected with, rewrote Bastion's programming, transforming him into Template.Warlock #7 The virus soon took complete control of Template and forced him to construct a Babel Spire on Earth to signal the alien Technarchy. To oppose them, Mainspring destroyed himself along with Template, while Warlock and Wolfsbane managed to destroy the Babel Spire.Warlock #8 Sometime later, Carol Danvers contacted the X-Men about the current whereabouts of the remains of Bastion/Template. The X-Men sent Shadowcat, Wolverine, and Gambit to break into the government facility, intending to reclaim their stolen computer files. While there, Template showed the three X-Men false holograms of events and lies about their teammates. The X-Men eventually got their files, but they were left with doubts and fears about their teammates.X-Men Declassified #1 =X-Force= Following the events of the Messiah Complex event, the fundamentalist Purifiers assaulted a heavily defended SHIELD installation, breaching the tight security with the aid of several double agents within the organization and recovered Bastion's head. At one of their churches, the Purifiers attached the head to the body of the Nimrod unit recovered from Forge's Aerie, returning Bastion to life. Immediately after his activation, the mutant-hunting robot alerts the Purifiers to the presence of the new X-Force.X-Force vol. 3 #1 (2008) After accessing Nimrod's database, Bastion concludes that the X-Men are the greatest mutant threat to the Purifiers' objectives in this timeline or any other and that there is no terrestrial force in existence that could guarantee the elimination of the X-Men. However, he reveals that he has found something that could: Magus.X-Force vol. 3 #2 It was later revealed that what Bastion discovered at the bottom of the ocean was not the real Magus, but one of his offspring in a mindless state. Bastion rewrote its programming and infected Donald Pierce and the Leper Queen, the recovered techno-organic remains of Cameron Hodge and Steven Lang, as well as the corpses of Bolivar Trask, Graydon Creed and Reverend William Stryker with the Technarch transmode virus, declaring them to be the future of humanity and the end of mutantkind.X-Force vol. 3 #3 His first move was to capture several mutants and inject them with a strain of the Legacy Virus to cause their powers to go berserk and kill themselves and thousands of humans. This would compel the United Nations to form a Mutant Response Division, which is successful, despite X-Force's efforts.X-Force vol. 3 #12‚Äì13, 17‚Äì18 Bastion also had Pierce act as his mole inside the X-Men's headquarters, all the while building several structures that surround Utopia.X-Force vol. 3 #19 =Second Coming= Bastion is the primary antagonist in the X-Men: Second Coming storyline. He is seen with Steven Lang, Cameron Hodge, and the revived Bolivar Trask, William Stryker, and Graydon Creed, stating that their forces are assembled and at his disposal. Bastion tells them that the Mutant Messiah has returned and gives them orders to kill her.X-Men: Second Coming one-shot Later, Bastion attempts to kill Hope on his own, but he is confronted by Rogue and then severely damaged when Nightcrawler sacrifices himself. When rebooting, Bastion takes on much of Nimrod's old appearance, but is finally destroyed towards the end of the crossover when Hope manifests a variety of the current X-Men's mutant powers and obliterates him.X-Force vol. 3 #28 =X-Men: Blue= Despite his apparent destruction, Bastion had survived the attack by activating, at the last second, his temporal drives and shunted himself into the future. However, Bastion had suffered catastrophic damage from Hope's assault and the time-shift had corrupted and compromised his systems. Arriving when mutants were being faced with extinction due to the Terrigenesis cloud, Bastion decided to re-dedicate himself to protecting mutants, assembling, and reprogramming a wave of standard sentinels. He eventually returned to the present and was soon confronted by the time- displaced X-Men which confirm that Bastion's actual goal is simply to preserve mutants until their population rises to a level where he can destroy them all himself. The team try to fight him but Bastion instead just left them and retreat with his Sentinels.X-Men: Blue #3 In the aftermath of Hydra takeover of the United States of America under the leadership of a Cosmic Cube-altered Captain America, Bastion seemingly started to work with Miss Sinister, Emma Frost and Havok to use Mothervine on a global scale.X-Men: Blue #9 Bastion went with Havok to take control of an army of Prime Sentinels; since his programming was unrecognizable by them, they identified him as a threat despite his role in their creation. Bastion continued to survey the development and growth of the Mothervine to continue mutant repopulation, much to the chagrin of Emma Frost.X-Men: Blue #23 After Sebastian Shaw failed in his attempt to kill Magneto to gain a role in the Mothervine plot, Bastion was present to negotiate with and later fight the Master of Magnetism, simultaneously unleashing a wave of Prime Sentinels to finally release Mothervine under Havok's order; Magento was able to escape by using a vial of Mutant Growth Hormone and throwing a lighthouse at the group, fleeing in the chaos.X-Men: Blue #24-25 Thanks to Bastion's efforts, both humans and mutants began to experience accelerated mutations through exposure to the Mothervine.X-Men: Blue #26 A group of mutants, led by Polaris, managed to infiltrate the Mothervine group's hideout once Mothervine was already active, with Bastion detecting their presence and alerting the rest of the group; Bastion incapacitated the daughter of Magneto when she refused Havok's offer to join them, and they were imprisoned as a result.X-Men: Blue #27 A traitorous Emma, disillusioned by the Mothervine plot, freed Polaris and her team after overseeing an experiment by Miss Sinister on Jimmy Hudson, and they made their way to the inner circle's meeting room. At this point, Magneto had discovered the mutant Elixir, who was capable of reversing the Mothervine mutations and was taken across the world to stop the rampancy, to the notice of Havok and Bastion. Emma and Polaris managed to break into their meeting, and Bastion began fighting them off. Ultimately, he was caught off-guard by the arrival of Xorn, who absorbed him into a wormhole and seemingly destroyed them both.X-Men: Blue #28 Powers and abilities Being a robot, Bastion has super strength, speed, intelligence, and endurance. He can also fly by using jet boots. He is immune to psychic reading from telepaths and has complete command of all Sentinels. He has an artificial healing factor like Nimrod, and the ability to turn people into Prime Sentinels. The Siege Perilous also conferred to Bastion something akin to eternal life, and he can exert itself on any cybernetic life form. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= A version of Bastion is seen in the Age of Apocalypse storyline. When the X-Men are discussing Abyss, they describe him as the one \\"rumored to have replaced Bastion\\". This iteration has never been seen in the comic and there is no indication whether or not he is related to the 616 version. In other media =Video games= * Bastion is the main villain in X-Men: Next Dimension, voiced by Don Morrow. This version rips information out of Forge's mind and plants devices in his Sentinels that can depower a mutant. At Asteroid M, either Magneto or Phoenix destroys him once and for all. In his character profile, it is implied that his real name is Sebastian Gilbert. * Bastion appears as one of the bosses in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, voiced by Alastair Duncan. This version seems to be a mere anti-mutant activist (though his true nature is mentioned in a trivia minigame), yet his ability to control Sentinels is noted, as the mission in question where he attacks the X-Men involved the X-Men teaming up with Sentinels to save civilians. Bastion then took control of the Sentinels to turn them against the X-Men. * Bastion appears in X-Men: Destiny, voiced by Keith Szarabajka. He is said to have killed Professor X in the opening cutscene. Magneto apparently killed him in the same battle. It's revealed that he had uploaded his mind into the Telos orbital satellite where he took control of Luis Reyes and used him along with the Mutant Response Division, Purifiers and U-Men to begin hostilities with Mutants. * Bastion appears as a Group Boss in Marvel: Avengers Alliance.

She is the chairperson and managing director of Biocon Limited, a biotechnology company based in Bangalore, India and the former chairperson of Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. In 2014, she was awarded the Othmer Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to the progress of science and chemistry. She is on the Financial Times‚Äô top 50 women in business list. In 2019, she is listed as the 65th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. She has been selected for EY entrepreneur of the year 2020.  Early life and education  Kiran Mazumdar was born on 23 March 1953 in Pune, Maharashtra state, to Gujarati parents. She was educated at Bangalore's Bishop Cotton Girl's High School, graduating in 1968. She then attended Mount Carmel College, Bangalore, a women's college offering pre-university courses as an affiliate of Bangalore University. She studied biology and zoology, graduating from Bangalore University with a bachelor's degree in zoology in 1973.She did not receive a M.Sc. or Ph.D. in 1973. She has been given a number of honorary degrees since then. Mazumdar hoped to go to medical school, but could not obtain a scholarship. Her father, Rasendra Mazumdar, was the head brewmaster at United Breweries. He suggested that she study fermentation science, and train to be a brewmaster, a very non-traditional field for women. Mazumdar went to Ballarat College, Melbourne University in Australia to study malting and brewing. In 1974, she was the only woman enrolled in the brewing course and topped in her class. She earned the degree of master brewer in 1975. She worked as a trainee brewer in Carlton and United Breweries, Melbourne and as a trainee maltster at Barrett Brothers and Burston, Australia. She also worked for some time as a technical consultant at Jupiter Breweries Limited, Calcutta and as a technical manager at Standard Maltings Corporation, Baroda between 1975 and 1977. However, when she investigated the possibility of advancing her career in Bangalore or Delhi, she was told that she could not be hired as a master brewer in India because \\"It's a man's work.\\" She began to look abroad for opportunities and was offered a position in Scotland.  Biocon  Before Mazumdar could move, she met Leslie Auchincloss, the founder of Biocon Biochemicals Limited, of Cork, Ireland. Auchincloss's company produced enzymes for use in the brewing, food-packaging and textile industries. Auchincloss was looking for an Indian entrepreneur to help establish an Indian subsidiary. Mazumdar agreed to undertake the job on the condition that if she did not wish to continue six months later she would be given a brewmaster's position comparable to the one she was giving up. = Beginning with enzymes = After a brief period as a trainee manager at Biocon Biochemicals Limited, of Cork, Ireland, to learn more about the business, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw returned to India. She started Biocon India in 1978 in the garage of her rented house in Bengaluru with a seed capital of Rs. 10,000. Although it was a joint venture, Indian laws restricted foreign ownership to only 30% of the company, which meant that 70% of the company belonged to Kiran Mazumdar Shaw. Initially, she faced credibility challenges because of her youth, gender and her untested business model. She was unable to secure funding for her company at the early stages of her business. A chance meeting with a banker at a social event finally enabled her to get her first financial backup. She also found it difficult to recruit people to work for her start-up, her first employee was a retired garage mechanic and her first factory was in a nearby 3,000-square- foot shed. The most complicated piece of equipment in her lab at that time was a spectrophotometer. Moreover, she faced the technological challenges associated with trying to build a biotech business in a country with poor infrastructure. Uninterrupted power, good quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, and workers with advanced scientific skills were not easily available in India at the time. The company's initial projects were the extraction of papain (an enzyme from papaya used to tenderize meat) and isinglass (obtained from tropical catfish and used to clarify beer). Within a year of its inception, Biocon India was able to manufacture enzymes and export them to the U.S. and Europe, the first Indian company to do so. At the end of her first year, Mazumdar used her earnings to buy a 20-acre property with plans to expand in the future. = Expanding into biopharmaceuticals = Mazumdar spearheaded Biocon's evolution from an industrial enzymes manufacturing company to a fully integrated bio-pharmaceutical company with a well-balanced business portfolio of products and a research focus on diabetes, oncology and auto-immune diseases. She also established two subsidiaries: Syngene (1994) which provides early research and development support services on a contract basis and Clinigene (2000) which focuses on clinical research trials and the development of both generic and new medicines. Clinigene was later merged with Syngene. Syngene was listed on BSE/NSE in 2015 and has a current market cap of ‚Çπ14,270 crores. In 1984, Kiran began to develop a research and development team at Biocon, focusing on the discovery of novel enzymes and on development of novel techniques for solid substrate fermentation technology. The company's first major expansion came in 1987, when Narayanan Vaghul of ICICI Ventures supported creation of a venture capital fund of US$250,000. This money enabled Biocon to expand its research and development efforts. They built a new plant featuring proprietary solid substrate fermentation technology based on a semi-automated tray culture process, inspired by Japanese techniques. In 1989, Biocon became the first Indian biotech company to receive U.S. funding for proprietary technologies. In 1990, Mazumdar incorporated Biocon Biopharmaceuticals Private Limited (BBLP) to manufacture and market a select range of biotherapeutics in a joint venture with the Cuban Center of Molecular Immunology. = Establishing independence = Biocon Biochemicals of Ireland was acquired from Leslie Auchincloss by Unilever in 1989. The partnership with Unilever helped Biocon to establish global best practices and quality systems. In 1997, Unilever sold its specialty chemicals division, including Biocon, to Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). In 1998, Kiran Mazumdar's fianc√©e, Scotsman John Shaw, personally raised $2 million to purchase the outstanding Biocon shares from ICI. The couple married in 1998, whereupon she became known as Kiran Mazumdar- Shaw. John Shaw left his position as chairman at Madura Coats to join Biocon. He became Biocon‚Äôs vice chairman in 2001. In 2004, after seeking the advice of Narayana Murthy, Mazumdar-Shaw decided to list Biocon on the stock market. Her intent was to raise capital to further develop Biocon's research programs. Biocon was the first biotechnology company in India to issue an IPO. Biocon's IPO was oversubscribed 33 times and its first day at the bourses and closed with a market value of $1.11 billion, making Biocon the second Indian company to cross the $1-billion mark on the first day of listing. = Affordable innovation = Mazumdar-Shaw's belief in \\"affordable innovation\\" has been a driving philosophy behind Biocon's expansion. Inspired by the need for affordable drugs in less-wealthy countries, she has looked for opportunities to develop cost-effective techniques and low-cost alternatives. She has also proposed that drug companies be cost-sensitive in marketing to developing countries, so that people can afford the drugs they need, particularly chronic therapies. Mazumdar-Shaw noticed the market potential for statins (cholesterol fighting drugs) early on. When the patent of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin expired in 2001, Biocon got involved in its development. Then the company expanded to other forms of statins. Part of her strategy was to enter into long-term supply contracts, establishing a dependable market base over time. Statins soon accounted for over 50 per cent of the company's revenue. The company‚Äôs revenue went up from ‚Çπ70 crore in 1998, to ‚Çπ500 crore in 2004 when it went public. Biocon continues to expand into new areas. Yeast expression platforms offer a desirable alternative to mammalian cell cultures for the genetic manipulation of cells for use in a variety of drug treatments. Unicellular methylotrophic yeasts such as Pichia pastoris are used in the production of vaccines, antibody fragments, hormones, cytokines, matrix proteins, and biosimilars. Biocon's major areas of research now include cancer, diabetes, and other auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Because of the high percentage of people in India who chew betel or tobacco, India accounts for eighty-six per cent of oral cancer in the world, known locally as \\"cancer cheek\\". Diabetes is prevalent, and people who do not wear shoes are at risk to have a minor scrape or injury develop into gangrene, or \\"diabetes foot\\". Biocon is also working on drugs to treat psoriasis, a skin pigment disease. Bio-pharmaceuticals developed by the company include Pichia-derived recombinant human insulin and insulin analogs for diabetes, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, and a biologic for psoriasis. Biocon is Asia's largest insulin producer, and has the largest perfusion-based antibody production facilities. As of 2014, Biocon directed about 10% of its revenue into research and development, a much higher proportion than most Indian pharmacological companies. Biocon has filed at least 950 patent applications based on its research activity. Mazumdar-Shaw has remained actively engaged in acquisitions, partnerships and in-licensing in the pharmaceuticals and bio-pharmaceutical areas, entering into more than 2,200 high-value R&D; licensing and other deals between 2005 and 2010.  Philanthropic activities  In 2004, Mazumdar-Shaw started a corporate social responsibility wing at Biocon, the Biocon Foundation. The Foundation focuses on health, education and infrastructure, especially in rural areas of Karnataka which lack healthcare facilities. Mazumdar-Shaw dislikes the term \\"philanthropy\\", believing that it often provides temporary fixes rather than addressing the root cause or the underlying situation. She prefers the term \\"compassionate capitalist\\", believing that properly applied business models can provide an ongoing foundation for sustainable social progress. Mazumdar once said, \\"Innovation and commerce are as powerful tools for creating social progress as they are for driving technological advancement. When they are put to use for social progress, the implementation is a lot cheaper, a lot more people benefit, and the effect is more lasting.\\" In 2015, she joined The Giving Pledge, promising that at least half of her wealth will be dedicated to philanthropy. = Health = Rural areas in India may have only one doctor for every two thousand people, it is estimated that 70 million people do not have the money to pay for a doctor's visit or for medicine. The Biocon Foundation is involved in numerous health and education outreach programs to benefit the economically weaker sections of Indian society.  Arogya Raksha Yojana  With Devi Shetty of Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospital, Mazumdar-Shaw has supported the development of Arogya Raksha Yojana (Disease Protection Program/Health Help). Through this program Biocon Foundation establishes clinics to offer clinical care, generic medicines and basic tests for those who cannot afford them. As of 2010, seven clinics each served a population of 50,000 patients living within a radius of 10 km, treating in total more than 3,00,000 people per year. Clinics organize regular general health checks in remote villages by bringing in physicians and doctors from network hospitals. To improve early detection of cancer, they have trained young women as community health workers, using smartphones to send photographs of suspicious lesions to oncologists at the cancer center. Public health campaigns such as \\"Queen of Heart\\" educate people about specific health issues and promote early detection of problems such as cardiovascular diseases. The clinics operate based on a model of micro-financed health insurance. Biocon provides low-cost drugs, making a negligible profit on a unit basis, but an overall profit on volume due to the participation of large numbers of people. Clinics also use a \\"subsidised convenience\\" pricing plan, under which more wealthy patrons pay full price in return for the convenience of scheduling their visits and procedures at desirable times, while poorer patients can obtain cheap or even free services by choosing less desirable times. Doctors and researchers look for opportunities to use cutting-edge technology in ways that will drive down costs and ensure quality of service.  Mazumdar-Shaw Medical Foundation  The death of her best friend, Nilima Rovshen, and the illnesses of her husband and her mother with cancer, have motivated Mazumdar-Shaw to support cancer research and treatment. In 2009, she established a 1,400-bed cancer care center, the Mazumdar-Shaw Medical Foundation, at the Narayana Health City campus in Bangalore, collaborating with Devi Shetty of Narayana Hrudayalaya. In 2011, she added a center for advanced therapeutics with a bone marrow transplant unit and a research center. Her goal is to create a world-class cancer center. Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation is a non-profit organization and has two arms to support its cause, which are Mazumdar Shaw Center for Translational Research and Mazumdar Shaw Cancer outreach program. = Education = In collaboration with McMillan India Limited and teacher Prathima Rao, Mazumdar-Shaw has supported development and use of a basic mathematics textbook, introduced in Kannada schools in 2006. She funded a multi-year research program by creating the Biocon Cell for Innovation Management with Prasad kaipa at the Indian School of Business in 2009. = Infrastructure = Mazumdar-Shaw speaks about the importance of improving India's infrastructure, emphasizing the need to address issues such as efficient governance, job creation, and food, water, and health insecurity. Biocon, Infosys and other companies have had a significant impact on Bengaluru. These companies attract many scientists who would otherwise go overseas. Once a \\"pensioner's paradise\\", Bangalore is now called \\"the best urban working environment in India\\". Biocon Park, built in 2005, is a ninety- acre campus with five thousand employees. Outside the developed, however, infrastructure is still poor. Mazumdar-Shaw is a proponent of good government and infrastructure. She supported the Bangalore Agenda Task Force, an initiative of S. M. Krishna and Nandan Nilekani to improve the city's infrastructure and standard of living. Mazumdar-Shaw is part of the Bangalore City Connect Foundation, a non-profit trust for discussion of civic issues, involving both urban stakeholders and the government. Mazumdar-Shaw is actively engaged in urban reform, partnering with Jana Urban Space Foundation and local government to improve roads. She is also involved in the Bangalore Political Action Committee (BPAC), which reviews and recommends candidates running in elections. After the 2009 flood, Biocon, Infosys and Wipro all committed to rebuilding homes for flood victims in north Karnataka. Biocon committed to building 3,000 houses at a cost of Rs 30 crore.

It serves the Mount Florida and Battlefield areas of Glasgow, Scotland. Services are provided by Abellio ScotRail on behalf of Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.  History  The station opened on 1 March 1886, on the Cathcart District Railway route from Glasgow to Cathcart.\\"Cathcart District Railway\\" Crawford, E Railscot; retrieved 1 September 2016 The station initially served as a temporary terminal for the route, as the section through to the terminus at Cathcart wasn't completed for a further two months. The western side of the Cathcart Circle Line was completed in April 1894, whilst the link to the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway's extension from to was added in 1904. This allowed through running from the eastern side of the Circle towards and thus to the Caledonian Railway main line to at Newton. Another spur at Cathcart laid concurrently also permitted through trains from here towards Neilston and the L&AR; terminus at Ardrossan (though only local trains using this route actually stopped here). Regular through trains beyond on this line ended in July 1932. Train services were electrified in May 1962, using overhead lines carrying 25 kV AC south of there and 6.25 kV to the north (due to clearance issues - the system was upgraded to 25 kV throughout in 1973). During the upgrade work, a grade separated junction was installed south of here to reduce conflicting moves between Circle line trains towards Cathcart and those heading for Kirkhill. The island platform layout here allows easy & convenient cross-platform interchange between the two branches to Neilston & Newton and Circle line trains. Due to its proximity to Hampden Park, the station can be very busy on days where there is a football match or any other event taking place at Hampden. A third platform had been provided on the Inner Circle to the south of the main station opposite the site of the extinct goods yard. This platform was only brought into use during major events and on Wednesdays. In January 2008, the northern exit from the station was closed whilst disabled access, including a lift, was provided. The stairs reopened in September 2008. The station has entrances from Battlefield Road, Prospect Hill Road, Bolton Drive, McLennan Street and the campus of Glasgow Clyde College: Langside Campus.  Services  = 2016 = A typical weekday and Saturday service is five trains per hour to (one train per hour in each direction on the Cathcart Circle, two from and one from Newton via Kirkhill), two trains per hour to Neilston and one train per hour to Newton (the one other hourly train to/from Newton runs via ).

The event was first run in 1876 making it the oldest of the Italian classic races and one of the oldest in the world. The event is owned by the RCS media group which owns the Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport. RCS also organises other top Italian cycling events such as the Giro d'Italia, Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico. The race is ranked 1.HC on the UCI continental calendar. The race was not run between the spring of 2007 and the autumn of 2012.Cyclingnews.com Gives details of race return in 2012. Race dates The position of the race in the European calendar has changed several times. Prior to 1987 the event was always seven days before Milan‚ÄìSan Remo and was seen as an important preparation race for the Spring Classics, however in 1987 Milano‚ÄìTorino was switched to a date in October just before the Giro di Lombardia because the race organisers were not happy with the inclement weather conditions characterised by early March in northern Italy. In October the race became part of the ‚ÄúTrittico di Autunno‚Äù (Autumn Treble) along with the Giro del Piemonte and the Giro di Lombardia which were all run in the same week. In 2005 Milan‚ÄìTorino returned to its traditional date in early March, however the 2008 edition again returned to a date in October exchanging dates with the Monte Paschi Eroica race which is now run in March. However the race did not take place in October 2008 and it was not run for the next four years until an agreement was reached in February 2012 between the race owners (RCS) and the Associazione Ciclistica Arona to organise the race for the next three years. The 2000 edition of the race was not held because of torrential rain which caused catastrophic mud slides in the Piedmont area. The route The race starts in Novate Milanese, just north west of Milan, and crosses the Ticino river at Vigevano after 40 kilometres, leaving the region of Lombardy and entering Piedmont. The first 95 kilometres of the race are run in a south westerly direction on broad flat roads, the climb of Vignale Monferrato (293 metres) is encountered and then a series of small undulations take the race to Asti after 130 kilometres. The race route crosses four railway level crossings at 70, 75, 129 and 133 kilometres and these can be important in helping any breakaways if the peloton is held up by a train. At Asti the race swings north westerly towards Turin climbing steadily before tackling the tough climb of the Superga Hill (620 metres) just 16 kilometres from the finish. The Superga climb is often the springboard for a group of riders to escape before the finish. From the top of the Superga it is a fast picturesque descent into Turin down the Strada Panoramica dei Colli through the Parco Naturale della Collina di Superga to finish in the Fausto Coppi velodrome on Corso Casale in Turin. In 2012 edition the finish was moved on the top of Superga (repeated two times). Significant winners Milano‚ÄìTorino is one of the fastest of the classics, Walter Martin won the 1961 edition at an average speed of 45.094 kilometres per hour and this stood for a time as the fastest speed in a classic race until beaten by Marinio Vigna in the 1964 edition of the Tre Valli Varesine. Swiss rider Markus Zberg now holds the record average speed for the race when he won in 1999 at a speed of 45.75 kilometres per hour. The record for the most wins in Milano‚ÄìTorino stands to the Italian Costante Girardengo who took five victories between 1914 and 1923. Pierino Favalli took a hat trick of wins between 1938 and 1940. Tour de France and Giro d‚ÄôItalia winner, the late Marco Pantani almost lost his life in the 1995 edition of Milano‚ÄìTorino when police allowed a four-wheel drive vehicle onto the course by mistake; Pantani and two other riders ploughed into the vehicle. Pantani sustained multiple leg breaks and missed the entire 1996 season. In 2012 the winner was Alberto Contador, who won the first single day race in his pro career. Races During the first race in 1876, there were only 10 competitors, however, there were an estimated 10,000 spectators.

Using a helicopter from 08:00 to sunset and rapid response vehicles by night, the service performs advanced medical interventions at the scene of the incident in life-threatening, time- critical situations. The charity was founded in 1989 in response to a report by the Royal College of Surgeons, which documented cases of patients dying unnecessarily because of the delay in receiving prompt and appropriate medical care. The charity was the first in the UK to carry a senior doctor in addition to a paramedic at all times on a helicopter, introducing a system that reduces the death rate in severe trauma by 3040%.Botker et al. \\"A systematic review of controlled studies: Do physicians increase survival with pre-hospital treatment?\\" Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine 2009, 17:12. The helicopters are hangared at RAF Northolt, but operate during the day. From their base at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, East London, a helicopter can reach any patient inside the M25 London orbital motorway, which acts as the service's catchment area, within 15 minutes. Missions commonly involve serious road traffic collisions, falls from height, stabbings and shootings, industrial accidents and incidents on the rail network. The team can perform advanced life-saving medical interventions, including open heart surgery, blood transfusion and anaesthesia, at the scene. The charity operates 24 hours a day, serving the 10 million people who live, work and travel within the M25. The service treats an average of five patients every day. Pre-hospital emergency medical care London's Air Ambulance Charity delivering an advanced trauma team to a critically injured patient at Tower Bridge London's Air Ambulance Charity has been at the forefront of innovation in pre-hospital emergency medical care since its inception in 1989. The service has adopted elements of medical, military and aviation culture to deliver the highest standards in intensive care to the roadside. The governance system and standard operating procedures (SOP) developed by the organisation are seen as a benchmark for other air ambulances across the world. London's Air Ambulance carries a senior doctor in addition to a paramedic at all times, providing a 24/7 advanced trauma care outside of hospital, provide general anaesthetics on scene, and carry blood on board and administer blood transfusion on the roadside. From 2018, a consultant in pre- hospital emergency medicine will be present on most shifts, in addition to the other physician and paramedic. In 2014, London's Air Ambulance performed the first pre-hospital resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). Other key treatments performed by the service include surgical chest draining (thoracostomy), surgical and non-surgical rapid sequence induction (RSI), pelvic splinting (crucial to prevent blood loss in high impact crashes and crush injuries), advanced pain relief and sedation. The service started a trial of a portable brain scanner which can detect blood clots on the brain in April 2015. Aircraft =Aerospatiale Dauphin N2= G-HEMS, the service's first helicopter, seen in 1998 The service's first helicopter was an A√©rospatiale SA 365N Dauphin N2. Built in 1982, it was registered G-HEMS, and delivered in December 1988, in time for the launch of the service in 1989.https://www.helis.com/database/cn/25858/https://londonsairambulance.co.uk/our- service/our-work/history/timeline#12 It initially wore a white livery, but was repainted several times, eventually into a red livery following sponsorship by Virgin.https://londonsairambulance.co.uk/our-service/our- work/history/timeline#43 It was retired from service in 2000. =MD 902 Explorer= Two MD Helicopters MD 902 Explorers are currently in service, registrations G-EHMS and G-LNDN. Both wear the same red-based livery, with green and yellow flashes, and are identical in model, equipment and crew. Only one helicopter is operational per day the other acts as a spare in case of break down, maintenance or, in a major incident, both helicopters are able to deploy. The helicopters usually cruise at , at an altitude of anywhere between . A regular fuel load, around , allows for one hour's flying time. Following a children's competition, the two helicopters were given names which are displayed on the side of each aircraft. In February 2016, G-LNDN was named Walter after the winning entrant's grandfather, whilst G-EHMS was named Rowan in April 2016 after the winning entrant's sister.https://londonsairambulance.co.uk/our-service/news/2016/02/six-year- old-fulham-resident-names-our-new- helicopterhttps://londonsairambulance.co.uk/our-service/news/2016/04/second- name-your-helicopters-competition-winner-revealed G-EHMS Rowan G-EHMS, the first MD 902 G-EHMS was built in 2000 and entered service in October of the same year, replacing the earlier SA 365N Dauphin 2. From 6 March 2012, the helicopter became the UK's first air ambulance to carry emergency blood supplies, allowing transfusions to be administered at the scene of an accident rather than later in hospital. A specialised refrigerator installed in the helicopter allows the transport of four units of the universal O-negative blood type which can be stored in the aircraft for up to 72hours (unused stocks can be returned to the hospital). G-LNDN Walter G-LNDN, the second MD 902 In 2015, the service launched a public appeal to raise ¬£6million to purchase, convert, equip, and operate a second helicopter. Of the total needed, just over ¬£4M represented the purchase price of the aircraft.Cost details outlined at Londonist website. ¬£2M was donated by the London Freemasons, which covered half the purchase price. The United Kingdom Government contributed ¬£1M using funds obtained from fines imposed on banks, with the remaining ¬£1M being raised by public subscription. In January 2016, the service took delivery of its second MD 902, registration G-LNDN. Built in 2008, the aircraft was previously registered in Qatar.https://www.helis.com/database/cn/42218/ In addition to the standard livery, it bears the masonic Square and Compasses symbol on each side, with the words \\"London Freemasons\\" lettered under the doors, to reflect the significant funding from the organisation. Rapid response cars One of London's Air Ambulance Charity's fleet of rapid response vehicles that came into service in 2018. At night, or when the helicopters are offline the medical crew, including a paramedic and senior trauma doctor, still respond to emergencies, but travel in a specially equipped rapid response car. They are noticeable from other ambulance vehicles as they are painted in red with high- visibility markings to display their advanced trauma team status. A four-wheel drive Skoda Kodiaq estate is also operated seven days a week by the Physician Response Unit (PRU). Funding The service costs approximately ¬£10M per year to run. Barts Health NHS Trust provides the helipad facility at The Royal London Hospital and remunerates the doctors seconded to and consultants permanently associated with the service. London Ambulance Service employs and remunerates the paramedics seconded to the service. London's Air Ambulance is a registered charity (number 801013) and the service is funded through charitable donations and corporate donors. The charity also runs a lottery for ¬£1 a week to raise funds for the service, and holds a number of small and large scale fundraising events throughout the year. Missions and major incidents London's Air Ambulance has attended more than 38,000 missions since its inception in 1989. In 2017, London's Air Ambulance attended 1,797 patient missions and three major incidents. * 533 Road traffic collisions * 560 Penetrating trauma (stabbings and shootings) * 412 Falls from height * 292 Other (incidents on the rail network, industrial accidents, asphyxiation, drowning etc.) Over the past 29 years, the service has coordinated medical response to the majority of London's major incidents, including the 7/7 bombings, the Soho nail bombing, the Grenfell Tower fire, the Bishopsgate, Aldwych, Westminster and London Bridge terrorist attacks and Paddington, Cannon Street and Southall rail crashes. On 7 July 2005, London's Air Ambulance dispatched 18 teams and flew medical supplies to the bomb sites across London, triaging and treating over 700 patients. Crew The helicopter crew consists of a pilot and co-pilot, in addition to an advanced trauma doctor, paramedic and, on most missions, a consultant. At night or in adverse weather conditions, the same medical crew operate from a rapid response car, which is driven by the paramedic on blue lights and navigated by the doctor. = Helipad fire & rescue = On arrival at the Royal London Hospital helipad, the dedicated helipad ground crew (fire crew) receive the patient and a dedicated, express elevator carries the patient to the accident and emergency department on the ground floor where a trauma team with A&E; doctors, general surgeons, specialist trauma surgeons, and anaesthetists assemble to assess and treat them. Fire crew must always be present when a helicopter lands or takes off from the helipad. Television appearances In 2004, the service was featured heavily in the BBC television series Trauma. In 2009, a standalone documentary about the air ambulance was made for the BBC by North One Television. Medic One: Life and Death in London showcased the service in a number of emergencies. In 1994, they featured in a special episode of the BBC series 999 entitled \\"The Flying Doctors\\". They also featured in BBC Two's An Hour to Save Your Life. Administration The HEMS Medical Director is Dr. Gareth Davies. Davies is also an Accident & Emergency and Pre-hospital Care Consultant working at The Royal London Hospital. Concerns were expressed in the media after the charity dismissed its Chief Executive in 2009.Laura Donnelly and Alison Moore, Air ambulance chief sacked after he raised financial concerns, Daily Telegraph, 28 November 2009 The Charity Commission promptly made recommendations on governance to the trustees, but did not express an opinion over the dismissal.Tania Mason, Charity Commission provides governance advice to air ambulance charity, Civil Society, 20 January 2010 Physician Response Unit The Physician Response Unit (PRU) is run by the service in partnership with Barts Health NHS Trust and London Ambulance Service NHS Trust. The service was remodelled in October 2017 to become a 12-hours a day, seven days a week service thanks to funding from Tower Hamlets Together. The PRU is staffed by a senior doctor and a London Ambulance Service EAC. The PRU carries advanced medication, equipment and treatments usually only found in hospital, such as instant result blood tests, urine tests and sutures to stitch serious wounds. In the remodelled service's first six months, 68% of patients were treated in the community.

Louis Tullius Joachim Visconti (Rome February 11, 1791 - December 29, 1853) was an Italian-born French architect and designer. Life Napoleon's Tomb designed by Visconti Son of the Italian archaeologist and art historian Ennio Quirino Visconti, Visconti designed many Parisian residences, public buildings and squares, including the Place Saint Sulpice and the overall design of the Fontaine Moli√®re, and was briefly the official architect for the Louvre under Napoleon III. He is probably most famed for designing the 1842 tomb of Napoleon at Les Invalides. His students include Joseph Poelaert, designer of the Palais de justice de Bruxelles. Louis Visconti came from a famous family of archaeologists - his grandfather Giambattista Antonio Visconti (1722-1784) had founded the Vatican Museums and his father, Ennio Quirino Visconti (1751-1818), was a curator. Ennio and his family moved to Paris in 1798 and were naturalised as French citizens in 1799, with Ennio becoming a curator of antiquities and paintings at the Mus√©e du Louvre. Between 1808 and 1817 Louis studied at Paris's √âcole des Beaux-Arts under Charles Percier. He also studied under the painter Fran√ßois-Andr√© Vincent. After winning second prize in the architecture section of the prix de Rome (1814) and the architecture department prize at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts (1817), he was made architecte-voyer to the 3rd and 8th arrondissements of Paris in 1826, curator of the 8th section of public monuments in Paris (made up of the Biblioth√®que royale, the monument on place des Victoires, Porte Saint-Martin, Saint-Denis and the colonne Vend√¥me) in 1832, divisional architect in 1848, and government architect in 1849. In the meantime, in 1840, he designed Paris's decorations for the return of Napoleon's remains and Napoleon's tomb at the Invalides. Collaborating with √âmile Tr√©lat in the works to rebuild the Biblioth√®que royale du Louvre in May 1848, he produced a first- draft design for completing the Palais du Louvre. He was made architect to the palais des Tuileries on 7 July 1852 and architect to Napol√©on III on 16 February 1853, and was put in charge of connecting the Palais du Louvre and the Palais des Tuileries, a project only completed later by Hector-Martin Lefuel. He was also made president of the Soci√©t√© Centrale des Architectes in 1852. Visconti died of a heart attack in 1853, the year of his election to the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts.

These constraints may allow for variations to the accounting standards an accountant is trying to follow. Types of constraints include objectivity, costs and benefits, materiality, consistency, industry practices, timeliness, and conservatism, though there may be other types of constraints not listed. These constraints deal with issues such as requiring evidence, balancing the costs and benefits of providing financial information, deciding the precision of a report, remaining consistent within a report and from year-to-year, following the practices of an industry, reporting in a timely manner, and not overstating profits and/or assets. Accounting constraints may be confused with constraints accounting the latter of which, much like throughput accounting or cost accounting, is a method of accounting. Types of Constraints = Objectivity = The constraint of objectivity deals with the issue of needing objective, verifiable evidence. = Costs and benefits = The costs and benefits constraint, also called the cost-effectiveness constraint, is pervasive throughout the framework. Companies must spend time and money to provide financial statements. To be more specific, Costs can constrain the range of information when providing financial reporting on the grounds that the companies must \\"collect, process, analyze and disseminate relevant information\\" which need time and money. For investors, they want to know all financial information if possible in ideal condition, which may cause tremendous financial burden in the corporations. Moreover, some financial information may not be valuable for external users to acquire a huge benefit, for example, how much money does a company spend for its greening of headquarters. Therefore, while deciding the components of financial reporting, companies need to measure the sense of particular financial information and the expenditure of providing particular information and the benefits they can acquire from this particular information. Properly speaking, if the costs in particular information exceed the benefit they can acquire, companies may choose not to disclose this particular information. For example, if there is a $0.1 difference between checkbook register and bank statement, accountant should ignore the $0.1 rather than waste time and money to find the $0.1. = Materiality = Companies need to consider materiality when providing financial information. Particularly, companies must disclose the material information which can influence the financial performance and some immaterial information can be excluded. For example, a company owns $10 million net assets and therefore a default of customer with $1000 is immateriality and in contrast if the amount of default is $2 million, which can influence the financial decisions and thus means material. However, there are also some small items which can transfer net profit to net loss and these item can be considered as material items. In order to judge whether the information is material or not, companies can based on the following materiality process:  Define purpose and scope  Expected: * Know well about your objectives: think about what you will do with the outcome of materiality process and objectives can be future trends or target setting area etc.; * Take your audience into consideration: who important for your financial report and who will read it; * Define the meaning of materiality for your company: the importance to stakeholder and is it relevant to your company; * Defence the scope of material topics in your company: which parts of your business will be covered in this assessment? Advanced: * Embed materiality: consider the materiality results when making business plans;  Identify Potential Topics  Expected: * Check sources to make a long list of possible material topics: internal data, external review or media reporting, etc.; * Assign responsibility: which team should be involved when making possible material topics: such as senior management team; * Contain both risks and opportunities such as cost savings or efficiency gains; * Take external stakeholder engagement into consideration: the impact and valuable feedback you can acquire from stakeholders; Advanced: * Invest in a digital solution: collect and store documentation; * Establish a sustained process: capture long term changes for material topics;  Categorise  Expected: * Classify the potential materiality themes into Categories such as group, country, etc.; * Check whether the topics are on the same level or not; * Align topics name based on the policies and strategies of your organization; * Each employee involved in this process need to understand the specific risks and opportunities; Advanced: * Connect each material topic with relevant external changes; * Consider how material topics can influence each other or overlap;  Gather information about the impact and importance of topics  Excepted: * Research every materiality theme and find the correlations between topics and business in terms of social, economic and environmental impacts; * Gather information about each material topics which can be used to prioritize the topics in next phase; Advanced: * Utilise Methodology such as KPMG True Value to quantify social, economic and environmental impacts;  Prioritise  Expected: * Prioritise material topics by: ** Identifying relevant business functions and choosing which internal stakeholders need to be joined in prioritizing topics. ** Utilising the methodology developed in phase 4 to ‚Äòscore‚Äô each topic. ** \\"Setting a threshold or cut-off point for de ning which topics will be considered material\\". Advanced: * Connect with enterprise risk management function;  Engage management  Expected: * Materiality assessment need to be signed off by senior business manager; * It is important to do the review which makes the process reliable; Advanced: * Send the materiality assessment's outcomes to the Board of Directors; * Include some social trends into outcomes, which can make the assessment into wider corporate strategy process;  Seek stakeholder feedback  Expected: * Identify which kind of stakeholders need to review the material topics and evaluate the outcomes; * Acquired feedback form stakeholders; Advanced: * Connect the results of materiality assessment with company strategies and operations; = Consistency = Accounting statements made over a long period of time should be consistent or similar to one another. If they are formatted similarly then comparisons can more easily be made between these documents. = Industry Practices = Industry Practices is a less dominant constraint compared to cost-benefit and materiality in financial reporting. This constraints means in some industries, it is hard and costly to calculate the production costs and therefore companies in these particular industries choose to only report the current market prices instead of production costs. For example, in agriculture industry, calculating cost per crop is difficult and expensive and hence they choose to report the price in the current market which is easier for farmers. = Conservatism = Accountants estimate the transactions and then choose whether to record the transactions or not based on their own judgment. In terms of that, conservatism is helpful for accountants to make a choice between two similar alternatives and it makes accountants choose to record the less optimistic choice. For example, If there is a possibility that customers will sue the company and they may also not to sue the company. In this case, accountants need to disclose this situation to investors. Moreover, the Conservatism is also a less dominated constraint, which means firms also need to consider more about bad news than good news when reporting financial statements. In particular, firms need to choose the method that \\"least likely overstates assets and income or understates liabilities and losses\\" when encountering accounting issues. For example, if the staff believe there will be 2% bad debt in terms of receivables based on historical information and another staff believe there will be 5% because of a sudden drop, the company needs to use the 5% figure when providing financial statements. = Timeliness = Perhaps most obviously, statements should be relevant in terms of date. Quarterly reports should not be made available only on a half-year basis, as some of the information in the report would not be very useful.

A successful dribble will bring the ball past defenders legally and create opportunities to score. Association football In association football, a dribble is one of the most difficult ball skills to master and one of the most useful attacking moves. In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling (the usage of technical maneuvers). In order to go past an opponent, dribbling can involve a wide variety of manipulative tricks and feints; Ronaldinho would often employ elaborate skills and feints, such as the elastico, in order to beat defenders. Dribbling is often invaluable especially in the third part of a pitch or at the wings, where most attacks take place. Dribbling creates space in tight situations where the dribbler is marked (closely guarded by a defender), and the dribbler can either score or create scoring chances after a successful dribble. However, dribbling, if poorly mastered and used, may result in the loss of possession either when the ball is intercepted or tackled by a defender. Some players prefer getting past players with speed and physicality, such as the winger Gareth Bale, some players go straight at opponents and look to go past them directly with a nutmeg (kicking the ball through their legs), such as Luis Su√°rez, whereas others may use feints, control, agility, and acceleration to evade tackles, such as Lionel Messi. Garrincha (left), Brazilian winger and 1962 World Cup star, is regarded as one of the greatest dribblers of all time. A skillful dribbler is often hard to dispossess; unsuccessful tackles (which do not reach the ball) may result in a useful free kick situation and a reprimand for the offender in the form of a penalty card. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Belgium playmaker Eden Hazard, renowned for being difficult to dispossess, set a World Cup record for successful dribbles completed in any World Cup game since 1966, with a 100% success rate in ten dribbles against Brazil. Early references to dribbling come from accounts of medieval football games in England. For example, Geoffrey Chaucer offered an allusion to such ball skills in fourteenth century England. In the Canterbury Tales (written some time after 1380) he uses the following line: \\"rolleth under foot as doth a ball\\". Similarly at the end of the 15th century comes a Latin account of a football game which was played at Cawston, Nottinghamshire, England. It is included in a manuscript collection of the miracles of King Henry VI of England. Although the precise date is uncertain it certainly comes from between 1481 and 1500. This is the first account of an exclusively \\"kicking game\\" and the first description of dribbling: \\"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and skillfully rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions\\". It is known that dribbling skills were a key part of many nineteenth-century football games at English public schools with the earliest reference to ball passing coming in 1863 rules of The Football Association. Basketball In basketball, dribbling is bouncing the ball on the floor continuously with one hand at a time. It is the only legal way that a player may maintain possession of the ball while walking or running. James Naismith's original rules said nothing about dribbling, merely stating that passing the ball was the legal way of advancing it. Players soon developed the strategy of \\"passing to themselves\\", which Naismith himself both endorsed and admired for its ingenuity, and which evolved into the dribble as it is known today. The first known team to dribble was Yale University in 1897.‚ÄúThe Evolution Of Professional Basketball‚Äù. Digital Archives The dribble allows for much faster advancement and thus more opportunities for scoring. It also provides an opportunity for a crafty player on the opposing team to \\"steal\\" the ball in mid-bounce. Once a player stops dribbling the ball and holds it, the player normally must either pass it to another player or take a shot; if the player dribbles and then holds the ball in any way (either grasping it with their hands or arms, or \\"palming\\" it, i.e. holding it too much toward its underside during the act of dribbling) then continues to dribble, the referee stops the play, signals either \\"double dribble\\" or \\"carrying\\", and turns the ball over to the other team. A \\"double dribble\\" may also be called if the player tries to dribble with both hands at the same time. Dribbling should be done with finger pads and the fingers should be relaxed and spread, The wrist should be pushing the basketball, and the forearm should be moving up and down. Skilled ball handlers bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the risk of a defender reaching in to steal the ball. Adept dribblers can dribble behind their backs, between their legs and change the speed of the dribble, making the player difficult to defend, and opening up options to pass, shoot or drive with the ball. The National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) was founded in 1927 to oppose a move to eliminate dribbling from the sport. Water polo Attacker (7) advances the ball by dribbling In water polo, dribbling is the technique of moving the ball while swimming forward. The ball is propelled ahead of the player with the wake created by alternating armstrokes, and often accompanied by occasional nudges using the nose or forehead. Since ball contact is minimal, this creates advantage for the ball carrier advancing the ball; the defender may not make contact unless the attacker is touching the ball. Using short, and rapid arm strokes with high elbows, the dribbling player is often able to shield the ball from tackling attempts by the opposing team, particularly those chasing from behind or approaching adjacently. This aggressive defensive technique ensures any tackling attempts, successful or not, risk potential injury as the turbulent elbow motion is considered legal by FINA, and so a defending player must avoid contact in their attempts to steal the ball from the dribbler. Related skills The requirement that a player perform a specialist skill in order to be allowed to run with the ball is common and necessary in many sports. Introducing these skills prevents players from taking the ball in hand and running the length of the field unchallenged. In this way, the dribbling is related to: *the \\"solo\\" in Gaelic football, kicking the ball to oneself while running *the \\"hop\\" in Gaelic football, bouncing the ball on the ground and back to oneself while running *the running bounce in Australian rules football, bouncing the ellipsoidal ball on the ground and back to oneself while running See also *Glossary of association football *Basketball moves *Glossary of water polo *Seal dribble *Step over References Ball games Association football terminology Basketball terminology Team sports Water polo techniques Water polo terminology Articles containing video clips ","title":"Dribbling"},{"id":"2938117","text":"Transport in Wales is heavily influenced by the country's geography. Wales is predominantly hilly or mountainous, and the main settlements lie on the coasts of north and south Wales, while mid Wales and west Wales are lightly populated. The main transport corridors are east-west routes, many continuing eastwards into England.http://new.wales.gov.uk/deet/publications/transport/wts/wtstrategy/wtsfe.pdf?lang=en One Wales: Connecting the Nation, The Wales Transport Strategy, Welsh Assembly Government, April 2008 Great Orme Tramway in Llandudno on the Great Orme Railways Wales' railway network developed in conjunction with that of the rest of the United Kingdom during the nineteenth century. The North Wales Coast Line and South Wales Main Line sought to profit from traffic between London and Ireland. Numerous railways were built to export coal and iron from South Wales and slate from North Wales. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, tourism was booming and railways served resorts such as Llandudno, Barry Island and locations along the Cambrian Coast Line. The network was rationalised during the twentieth century (particularly by the Beeching cuts), with mainly east-west routes retained. As a result, the rail network within Wales is no longer contiguous. Devolution led to the formation of a single franchise for Wales in 2003. The Wales & Borders franchise, which includes some railway lines in England for completeness, is currently operated by Transport for Wales. As rail usage has grown during the past decades, several freight lines have seen rail services reintroduced, including the Cardiff City Line, the Vale of Glamorgan Line, and the Ebbw Valley Railway. As of 2008, there are of mainline railways in Wales.According to the \\"Wales Route Utilisation Strategy ‚Äì Draft for Consultation\\" published by Network Rail in 2008, there are 678 miles (1091 km) of railways in Wales, not counting the \\"heritage\\" lines. Transport for Wales operate all mainline services wholly within Wales. These range from rural lines such as the Welsh Marches Line to the Cardiff commuter lines, and long distance routes between North and South Wales, via Chester, Wrexham General and Shrewsbury. They also operate services from Wales to Manchester, Crewe, Birmingham and Gloucester. Services to London are operated by Greater Western Railway (from South Wales) and Avanti West Coast (from North Wales). Great Western Railway also operate services from Cardiff to Portsmouth via Bristol, Bath and Southampton, and CrossCountry operate services from Cardiff to Nottingham. The bulk of rail transport in Wales today is concentrated in the south, with Cardiff Central, Cardiff Queen Street, Newport, Swansea and Cardiff Bay being the busiest stations.Station Usage. Office of Rail Regulation. Most passengers travel on east-west routes. In 2018-2019, there were 33.5 million rail passenger journeys which either started or ended in Wales, including 24.0 million journeys within Wales. Cardiff was the destination for almost 44 per cent of these journeys. In the north, the bulk of rail travel is concentrated around Wrexham General, Wrexham Central and the Llandudno Junction to Chester section. The South Wales Main Line is being electrified as far as Cardiff Central.http://www.rail.co.uk/rail-news/2014/welsh-electrification/ Owing to the closure of the line between Swansea and Aberystwyth, and the absence of other north-south routes, it is very problematic to travel from Swansea to Caernarfon by rail. =Urban rail= The only form of commuter rail system in Wales is the Valley Lines network serving Cardiff and the South Wales valleys, serving 20 stations in Cardiff and 61 stations in the surrounding area. Train frequency at the core of the network is up to every 5 minutes.http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=5138 Station buildings in Caerleon awaiting platform rebuilding and station re- opening on the Welsh Marches Line Arriva Trains Wales at the potential re- opened station of Pontrilas, also on the Welsh Marches Line =Tram= The only surviving tram service within Wales is the Great Orme Tramway, a cable- hauled tramway in Llandudno which survives as a tourist attraction. Cardiff, Swansea and Newport had extensive tram systems until the mid-20th century. Plans were mooted in the late 1990s for a modern tram system to serve Cardiff's urban areas, but these were shelved due to the costs of building and maintaining such a system.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1765120.stm BBC News article on ULTra plans for Cardiff Sourced 22 February 2008https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/jan/16/transportintheuk Guardian article Sourced 22 February 2008 The world's first passenger tram service was the Mumbles Railway in Swansea, initially horse-drawn but later operated by steam and electric trams.Early Days of Mumbles Railway The Llandudno and Colwyn Bay tramway, demolished in 1956, has a preservation society which has restored some original carriages.http://swissitalianpaddlesteamers.com/lcbtramsoc/home.html The Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Tramway Society =Heritage railways= Wales has a large number of heritage railways. Some of these were former industrial narrow gauge railways, such as the Corris Railway. Others were formed from portions disused standard gauge railways, either kept as standard gauge (e.g. Barry Tourist Railway) or converted to narrow gauge (e.g. Brecon Mountain Railway). Some of the narrow gauge heritage railways are marketed as the Great Little Trains of Waleshttp://www.greatlittletrainsofwales.co.uk/ Notable heritage railways include: *The Talyllyn Railway, the first railway in the world to be saved by a preservation society *The Snowdon Mountain Railway, the only rack and pinion railway in the United Kingdom *The Ffestiniog Railway, the oldest surviving railway company in the world *The Welsh Highland Railway, linking the Ffestiniog Railway at Porthmadog to Caernarfon *The Gwili Railway, the first standard gauge preserved railway to operate in Wales *The Vale of Rheidol Railway, the last steam railway owned by British Rail until 1989 Road The trunk road network carries around one third of road traffic in Wales. Around 80 per cent of traffic on Welsh roads is cars, taxis, and minibuses, mainly on east-west routes in north and south Wales. =South Wales= Wales has 83 miles (133 kilometres) of motorway, all of which are in the south. The major artery is the M4, which enters Wales via the Second Severn Crossing and terminates at Pont Abraham in Carmarthenshire. The M4 in South Wales has 27 junctions and is an important route between the main urban areas in the region. It links Llanelli, Swansea, Neath, Port Talbot, Bridgend, Cardiff and Newport directly to London and the rest of southern England, and indirectly to the Midlands via the A449, A40 and M50. Following construction of the new bridge, the original Severn Bridge‚Äîwhich crosses the river further upstream at Chepstow‚Äîwas re-numbered the M48 motorway. Tolls were once collected upon entering Wales using either of the two bridges; these were abolished on 19 December 2018.https://www.severnbridge.co.uk/Home.aspx?.Parent=contact6&FileName;=toll- removal-road-works65 The A48(M) is a small spur from the M4, from west Newport to east Cardiff. The second major road is the A470 dual carriageway that connects Cardiff with the South Wales Valleys towns. It suffers from severe congestion especially during peak hours due to significant in-commuting to the Cardiff area. The A465 Heads of the Valleys road, currently being upgraded to dual carriageway, provides a link between the M4 near Neath across the Heads of the Valleys to Abergavenny, Monmouth and England's West Midlands via the A40 and M50. =North Wales= One of the main arteries for North Wales is the A494, running from Queensferry (near the English border) to Dolgellau. The road begins from the M56 motorway, connecting North Wales with Chester and Manchester Airport, both in England. The more important A55 runs from Holyhead (for ferry connections to Ireland), Conwy, Llandudno Junction and Rhyl to a junction with the M53 motorway near Chester. One of the oldest roads, the A5 runs from the port of Holyhead south east to Bangor then down through Snowdonia to Betws-y-Coed, Corwen, Llangollen and over the English border south of Chirk. This route has served as the main passage for London-Dublin traffic for many years although its usage has been superseded by the A55 coast road. It is now more famed as a scenic route, and notorious for many Bank Holiday traffic jams. =North‚Äìsouth= Two routes serve as the main north- south links. The A483 begins near Swansea and takes a north-easterly route to Ammanford, Llandeilo, Llandovery, Llanwrtyd Wells, Builth Wells, Llandrindod Wells, Newtown, Welshpool, Oswestry and Wrexham, finally ending at Chester. The A470 begins in Cardiff Bay and passes through Cardiff, north-to-north- westerly, on to Pontypridd, Abercynon, Merthyr Tydfil, Brecon, Builth Wells, Rhayader, Llangurig, Llanidloes, Llandinam, Commins Coch, Mallwyd, Trawsfynydd, Blaenau Ffestiniog, Dolwyddelan and Betws-y-Coed, terminating at Llandudno. It is a dual carriageway between Cardiff and Merthyr (where it meets the Heads of the Valleys Road, the A465), and the section of this route into Cardiff is heavily used. =Bus and coach network= Cardiff Bus in Cardiff Optare Tempo in Aberystwyth, on TrawsCambria interurban service X40 Bus services are predominantly provided by the council owned Cardiff Bus and Newport Bus in the respective cities. Private sector operators in Wales include: * Stagecoach South Wales, which provides services on a number of routes centred on Cardiff and the South Wales Valleys,Stagecoach South Wales Bus Routes Map and a low-cost coach service from Cardiff to London as part of its Megabus brand * First Cymru, which offers services centred on Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Llanelli, Carmarthen, Haverfordwest and South Pembrokeshire,FirstGroup UK Bus South & West Wales About Us also providing a key link from Bridgend/Swansea to CardiffFirstGroup UK Bus South & West Wales * Arriva Buses Wales, which provides services through North Wales * NAT Group, which provides services between East and West Cardiff, and from Central Cardiff to Cardiff Airport, Pontypridd, Barry and Bridgend In North Wales, National Express offers services from major towns to Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, London, Newcastle, Leeds and Bradford. In South Wales, National Express provides direct services from major towns and cities to Bristol, Gatwick Airport, Heathrow Airport and London Victoria. Services also operate from Cardiff and Newport to Birmingham, Nottingham, Bradford, Sheffield and Hull. Megabus operates services from Cardiff to Bristol, London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle. TrawsCymru is sponsored by the Welsh Government and offers intra-Wales routes, which are: * Bangor to Aberystwyth via Porthmadog, Dolgellau and Machynlleth; * Aberystwyth to Cardiff via Aberaeron, Lampeter Carmarthen and Swansea; * Aberystwyth to Cardigan via Aberaeron; * Wrexham to Barmouth via Llangollen, Bala and Dolgellau; * Aberystwyth to Cardigan via New Quay; and * Brecon to Newtown via Builth Wells and Llandrindod Wells. =Traffic pollution= A number of places in Wales suffer from air pollution. Airports Wales has two airports offering scheduled services, Cardiff and Anglesey, with the latter offering only domestic services to Cardiff. In South Wales the air travel market is estimated to be in the region of 3.5 million passengers, half of whom are served by Cardiff Airport while the remainder travels mainly to Heathrow, Bristol and Gatwick. Over three-quarters of passengers passing through Cardiff Airport are from international flights, and the remainder are domestic passengers mainly travelling between Cardiff and Belfast, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Glasgow or Jersey. The North Wales air passenger market is small and Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham airports provide the main access. An air service with a flight time of around one hour between Cardiff Airport and Anglesey Airport started in May 2007, with two return flights a day, and attracted 40,000 passengers over the first 2¬Ω years. It was originally run by Highland Airways but, after that company's closure, was taken over on a temporary basis by Isle of Man-based company Manx2 (now Citywing) in 2010.BBC News: New operator for Cardiff to Anglesey air service, 30 April 2010 The service is now operated by Eastern Airways. Cardiff Airport is the sole airport in Wales for air freight, and is ranked 19th in the UK in terms of freight movement. However, Airbus flies out some of the aircraft wings produced in its Broughton plant.  Cycling  = Commuting and Active Travel = According to the National Survey for Wales 2017-18, almost 2% of the Welsh population cycled daily for active travel purposes. In total, 6% of the population actively travelled by bicycle at least once a week. Welsh Government data suggests that cycling in Wales is male-dominated; 12% of men said they cycle at least once per month for active travel purposes in 2017, compared to only 6% of women. In Wales, the Active Travel (Wales) Act was passed in 2013 which requires ministers and Welsh local authorities to 'map' active travel routes and networks across the country. It also requires Welsh Ministers to \\"report on active transport in Wales\\". In 2018, Cardiff City Council announced plans to develop a Cycle Superhighway network, similar to the network which exists in London. The project has since been rebranded, and five new Cycleways have been proposed in the city. The scheme is due to be completed over a fifteen-year period and is aimed at promoting active travel by bicycle in the city. The first five routes are due to open at the end of the first phase of the project in 2021. Despite Cardiff's Cycleways scheme, Flintshire is Wales' top local authority for active travel by bicycle; in the National Survey for Wales 2017-18, almost 18% of respondents in Flintshire said that they travel at least once per month by bicycle, compared to just over 16% of respondents in Cardiff. Fewer than 4% of the respondents in Carmarthenshire, Newport, Denbighshire and Blaenau Gwent said that they actively travel by bicycle at least once per month. = Leisure = Sustrans maintains several routes in Wales which form part of the National Cycle Network. Ports Milford Haven is the fourth-largest port in the UK in terms of tonnage, and the busiest for oil products. Newport is the busiest UK port for iron and steel, and Port Talbot is the third-busiest for ores. Port Talbot has the deepest berthing facilities in the Severn estuary and is one of only a few harbours in the UK capable of handling Capesize vessels of up to 170,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) In 2005, the freight tonnage share of Welsh ports was: * Milford Haven ‚Äì 63.7% * Port Talbot ‚Äì 14.5% * Holyhead ‚Äì 7% * Newport ‚Äì 6.7% * Cardiff ‚Äì 4.2% * Swansea ‚Äì 1.2% * Fishguard ‚Äì 0.9% * Barry ‚Äì 0.8% * Neath ‚Äì 0.7% * Mostyn ‚Äì 0.3% Ferries MV Ulysses, the largest ferry on the Irish Sea, plying from Holyhead to Dublin Port Welsh ports also provide passenger and freight ferry services. In 2005, 3.2 million sea passengers travelled to and from Ireland. Holyhead, the third largest passenger ferry port in the UK, handled over 2.3 million passengers; Fishguard and Milford Haven (Pembroke Dock) handled over 800,000 passengers a year. The Cardiff Waterbus runs along the River Taff in Cardiff, connecting the city centre with Cardiff Bay and Penarth. =SailRail= Transport for Wales, Iarnr√≥d √âireann, as well as Irish Ferries and Stena Line promotes SailRail From South Wales using West Wales Lines to Fishguard Harbour and on Stena Line to Rosslare Europort service which links with the Iarnr√≥d √âireann trains to Dublin Connolly on the Dublin‚ÄìRosslare railway line. Whilst from North Wales the North Wales Coast Main Line connects Holyhead with a choice of ferries, either Stena Line or Irish Ferries to Dublin Port, for connecting buses to Dublin Connolly railway station.

NetDay President Bill Clinton installing computer cables with Vice President Al Gore on NetDay at Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, CA. March 9, 1996. Gage founded NetDay in 1995 with Michael Kaufman and several others. NetDay was the first crowd sourcing event organized using the Internet. Gage created zoomable maps of the 140,000 schools in the United States, placing a meter-accurate dot for each school, color-coded for whether or not the school was connected to the Internet. He created a web-based sign-up page for each school, and \\"called on high-tech companies to commit resources to schools, libraries, and clinics worldwide so that they could connect to the Internet.\\" At some schools, hundreds of volunteers signed up, promising to come to the school on Saturday, March 9, 1996, to install Ethernet cables to five classrooms and the library. On the first NetDay in California, over 100,000 engineers wired 4,000 schools. President Clinton and Vice-President Gore pulled cables throughout Ygnacio Valley High School. Over the next year, over 70,000 schools across the United States held NetDays to wire their schools, and NetDay spread to Korea, Great Britain, France, and other countries. In the first state, California, over 100,000 volunteers wired 4,000 schools in one day: March 9, 1996. NetDay was endorsed by President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, active participants in NetDay '96. Over the next two years, over 70,000 US K-12 schools held NetDays, and Korea, Great Britain, France and other countries held national NetDays. In 1998, Gage was awarded the ACM Presidential Award by Chuck House, the President of the ACM for his work on NetDay. Bringing Networking to Water: Human Needs Project Gage joined Connie Nielsen and David Warner in 2012 to build a large community center in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. The Kibera Town Centre is a research platform and learning center, applying new and innovative technologies to provide clean water and waste water treatment in a huge urban slum. The Kibera Town Centre borehole can provide over 400 cubic meters of pure water a day to the 1,000 square-meter facility, which serves over 1,000+ people a day with a combination of educational and career services, showers, toilets, laundry, cafe, and financial services, and provides educational materials to the 4,000 students of neighboring Olympic Primary School, Kenya's largest primary school. The facility is connected to high-speed fiber optic cable, and has built a half- gigabit wireless network for Kibera. Family Gage is married to Linda Schacht Gage, a lecturer in Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and has two children: Peter Gage, formerly with the US Department of Energy, now with Renewable Finance, and Kate Gage, who helped create the USAID Global Development Laboratory, and is now Senior Policy Advisor, International Science and Technology, in the Office of Science and Technology, White House.

The trees planted will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide, as well as environmental benefits, such as water and air quality preservation, and biodiversity protection. Main Projects ForestFriends (www.forestfriends.eco) The ForestFriends initiative was launched in 2017 with the aim to catalyze carbon mitigation action for tourists. The project supports forest restoration efforts in biodiversity hotspots in Peru and Costa Rica. The project is led by GreenInitiative in collaboration with key partners. Carbon Neutral Now - www.carbonneutralnow.eco This project aims to support SMEs to engage into climate action, measuring, reducing and offsetting its carbon footprint. GreenInitiative leads this project since 2015, having supported more than 50 companies. Carbon Neutralization of the 8th Conference of the Parties to the Biological Diversity The purpose of the Project done by The Green Initiative is the neutralization of the Greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions related to the realization of the COP 8 through the reforestation of a degraded riparian area in the City of Curitiba . The Project will be realized in two stages and will demonstrate in a practical way a possibility to contribute at the same time to the Biodiversity and Climate Conventions. Carbon Free CD The Green Initiative is the first organization in Brazil to develop a Carbon Free Album (Compact Disc). The musician Txai Brasil released his first album which is the first in Brazil to have its carbon emissions neutralized by reforesting 1 ha of riparian area in the State of S√£o Paulo - Brazil. The production, distribution and usage of the 3.000 copies caused an emission of 5.4 tonnes of CO2 equivalent to the atmosphere which will be absorbed by the reforestation of the riparian area.

It is the smallest town in Slovakia with only a population of around 1,400. It is known for its mineral water, hot springs and destination spas. It's located near the edge of the Bansk√° Bystrica Region of Slovakia. Geography It is located in the foothills of the Krupina Plain (inner western Carpathian Mountains) in the valley of the ≈†tiavnica river, around 27 km south-west from Krupina and 15 km north from ≈†ahy. Besides the main settlement, there is a formerly independent village, Merovce (annexed in 1960). The town lies in the Stredoslovenska wine region and is surrounded by vineyards. Travertine piles and \\"Roman\\" spa (see image gallery) can also be found. History Archaeological discoveries show that the town was inhabited in the Neolithic era. The first written acknowledgement dates back to 1284 as Dyud. The oldest mention of hot springs was in 1551, but there is strong evidence that the Romas knew of the thermal pools over 2000 years ago. It was the venue for the 2013 European Race Walking Cup. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 1,500 inhabitants. 95.67% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 3.53% Hungarians and 0.20% Roma. The religious make-up was 55.67% Roman Catholics, 28.93% Lutherans and 11.27% people with no religious affiliation. Sister city Dudince is a twin town of Kent, Ohio, in the United States.

Reprint edition, 4 vols., (October 2004), Lawbook Exchange, is a papal bull written in 1454 by Pope Nicholas V to King Afonso V of Portugal. As a follow-up to the Dum Diversas, it confirmed to the Crown of Portugal dominion over all lands south of Cape Bojador in Africa. Along with encouraging the seizure of the lands of Saracen Turks and non-Christians, it repeated the earlier bull's permission for the enslavement of such peoples. The bull's primary purpose was to forbid other Christian nations from infringing the King of Portugal's rights of trade and colonisation in these regions, particularly amid the Portuguese and Castilian competition for ascendancy over new lands discovered. This bull should not be confused with a September 21, 1451, bull by the same name, also written by Nicholas V, relieving the dukes of Austria from any potential ecclesiastical censure for permitting Jews to dwell there. Background Henry the Navigator Around 1312 Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello came upon the Canary Islands. The Portuguese travelled there in 1341 both to trade and raid. By 1346 slave raiding was occurring. However, the first attempt at permanent colonization was sponsored by the Castilians in 1402.Thornton, John. Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400‚Äì1800, Cambridge University Press, 1998 During the 14th century, a variety of forces competed for control of the Canaries: Genoese, Catalan- Mallorcan, Castilian, and Portuguese. In the following century, Castile and Portugal were the primary contenders. In the early 15th century the Portuguese searched for a sea route to India to participate in the spice trade. As a first step, Prince Henry the Navigator launched expeditions to explore the West Coast of Africa. This experience exerted a deep impression so that his reign later on was marked by an ambitious expansion that resulted in exploratory achievements. It led, however, to disputes between the Portuguese and the Castilians regarding control along the African coast. As an independent third party, the Pope would, on occasion, be asked to arbitrate disputes between kingdoms. On January 5, 1443, in the papal bull Rex regum, Eugenius IV had taken a neutral position on the disputed claims of Castile and Portugal over territory in Africa. History Portuguese possessions in Morocco (1415‚Äì1769) It was not until Alfonso V of Portugal responded to a Papal call for aid against the Turks, who eventually seized Constantinople in 1453, that Pope Nicholas V supported the Portuguese claims in the bull Dum Diversas.Ehler, Sidney Z. and Morrall, John B., Church and State Through the Centuries: A Collection of Historic Documents with Commentaries, Biblo & Tannen, 1967 Nonetheless, in 1454 a fleet of caravels from Seville and Cadiz traded along the African coast and upon their return were intercepted by a Portuguese squadron. One of the ships was captured with crew and cargo taken to Portugal. Enrique IV of Castile threatened war. Afonso V appealed to the Pope for moral support of Portugal's right to a monopoly of trade in lands she discovered.Bown, Stephen R., 1494: How a Family Feud in Medieval Spain Divided the World in Half, p. 73, Macmillan, 2012 The bull, issued in January 1454, endorsed Portuguese possession of Ceuta (which they already held) and the exclusive right to trade, navigation, and fishing in the discovered lands. It provided an exemption from a Canon Law prohibition of trading with infidels. Content The bull praises earlier Portuguese victories against the Muslims of North Africa and the success of expeditions of discovery and conquest to the Azores and to Africa south of Cape Bojador. It also repeats earlier injunctions not to supply items useful in war such as weaponry, iron or timber to either Muslims or non-Christians. In Dum Diversas, the European trade with Muslims was strictly prohibited but Romanus Pontifex gave the King of Portugal an exception, provided that the trade did not include iron, weapons, and wood for building. Overall, there were the threats of ecclesiastical punishments, including excommunication and interdiction, for those who violate the provisions of the papal grant. The substance of the Bull's articles are as follows: Effect King Afonso V gave a ceremonial lecture on the bull in Lisbon Cathedral on October 5, 1455, to inform the foreign representatives of commerce. With the bull the Portuguese had a monopoly for trade in the new areas in Africa and Asia. It also served as the legal basis for boarding foreign ships in that area. Historian Stephen Bown notes that, \\"... Prince Henry and King Afonso V had now also shrouded Portuguese commercial activities in a cloak of pious devotion to the church's work\\". Along with the right of conquest, Romanus Pontifex effectively made the Portuguese king and his representatives the church's direct agents of ecclesiastical administration and expansion. The Portuguese authorities sent to colonise lands were not only commanded to build churches, monasteries, and holy places, but also authorized to > ...send over to them any ecclesiastical persons whatsoever, as volunteers, > both seculars, and regulars of any of the mendicant orders (with license, > however, from their superiors), and that those persons may abide there as > long as they shall live, and hear confessions of all who live in the said > parts or who come thither, and after the confessions have been heard they > may give due absolution in all cases, except those reserved to the aforesaid > see, and enjoin salutary penance, and also administer the ecclesiastical > sacraments freely and lawfully.... . This authority to appoint missioners was granted to Alfonso and his successors. =Colonialism= In 1493 Pope Alexander VI issued the bull Inter caetera stating one Christian nation did not have the right to establish dominion over lands previously dominated by another Christian nation. Together, the bulls Dum Diversas and Romanus Pontifex, along with Inter Caetera, have been interpreted as serving as a justification for the Age of Imperialism. They were also early influences on the development of the slave trade of the 15th and 16th centuries, even though the papal bull Sublimus Dei of 1537 forbade the enslavement of non-Christians. The executive brief for Sublimus Dei was withdrawn by the Pope after protests by the Spanish monarchy. Paul III publicly sanctioned slavery in Rome in 1545, the enslavement of Henry VIII in 1547, and the purchase of Muslim slaves in 1548.\\"The Catholic Church and Slavery\\", J. F Maxwell, 1975, Barry-Rose Publishers Norman Housley observes that \\"it would be unfair to criticize the papal court exclusively for its failure to be more discriminating in its grants or to take more frequently the kind of action which Eugenius IV adopted in 1454 over the Canaries.\\"Housley, Norman. Religious Warfare in Europe 1400‚Äì1536, p. 187, Oxford University Press, 2002 The idea of discovery, and the conversion and enslavement that accompanied it, were identified with hard-held concepts of crusade and chivalry at that time. =United States= In the 1823 case Johnson v. M'Intosh Chief Justice John Marshall found in favor of a \\"universal recognition\\" of a so-called discovery doctrine that held that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession.Marshall, John. Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681, 8 Wheat. 543 (1823) > Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her > discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with > the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by > discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the Brazils by the same title. Most of the opinion is dicta; thus, all that the opinion holds with respect to aboriginal title is that it is inalienable, a principle that remains well- established law in nearly all common law jurisdictions. This decision was upheld in the 1831 case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over Cherokees within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as \\"domestic dependent nations\\". This decision was modified in Worcester v. Georgia, which stated that the U.S. federal government, and not individual states, had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans. In recent years, Native American groups including the Ta√≠no and Onondaga have called on the Vatican to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1455, and 1493. The Haudenosaunee countered the papal bulls with the Two Row Wampum conditionally accepting the bulls, stating through the two row wampum: \\"You say that you are our Father and I am your Son. We will not be like Father and Son, but like Brothers. This wampum belt confirms our words....Neither of us will make compulsory laws or interfere in the internal affairs of the other. Neither of us will try to steer the other's vessel.\\" =Mission= After Vasco da Gama found the sea route to India in 1498, the Portuguese practiced trading for four centuries. Portuguese clerics were only responsible for the needs of the Portuguese, and clerics of other nations were not allowed to operate in Portuguese India. In Goa, envoys of the Pope were arrested and sent back to Portugal.

Balochistan is divided between the Pakistani province of Balochistan, the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan and the Afghan region of Balochistan. Prehistoric Balochistan dates to the Paleolithic. Pre-Islamic history The earliest evidence of human occupation in what is now Balochistan is dated to the Paleolithic era, represented by hunting camps, chipped and flaked stone tools. The earliest settled villages in the region date to the ceramic Neolithic (c. 7000‚Äì5500 BCE), and included the site of Mehrgarh located in the Kachi Plain. These villages expanded in size during the subsequent Chalcolithic, when interaction increased. This involved the movement of finished goods and raw materials, including chank shell, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and ceramics. By the Bronze Age in 2500 BCE, Balochistan had become part of the Harappan cultural orbit, providing key resources to the expansive settlements of the Indus river basin to the east. Pakistani Balochistan marked the westernmost extent of the Indus Valley civilisation. The remnants of the earliest people in Balochistan were the Brahui people, a Dravidian speaking people closely related to the Dravidian speaking people of South India. The Brahuis were originally Hindus and Buddhists, similar to the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian speaking peoples in the rest of the subcontinent. However, unlike the rest of northern India, where Indo-Aryan languages rose to prominence, the Brahuis retained the Dravidian language throughout the millennias. In 650 BC, the Greek historian Herodotus described the Paraitakenoi as a tribe ruled by Deiokes, a Persian zaid, in north-western Persia (History I.101). Arrian described how Alexander the Great encountered the Pareitakai in Bactria and Sogdiana, and had Craterus conquer them (Anabasis Alexandrou IV). The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea in the 1st century described the territory of the Paradon beyond the Ommanitic region on the coast of modern Baluchistan. Ancient empires at the time of Alexander the Great After the victory of the Mauryan Empire against the Greeks in the Seleucid‚ÄìMauryan war, much of Baluchistan came under the rule of Chandragupta Maurya of ancient India. Chandragupta and Seleucus made a peace settlement in 304 BCE. Selecucus Nucator ceded the satrapies, including those in Baluchistan to the expanding Mauryan Empire. The alliance was solidified with a marriage between Chandragupta Maurya and a princess of the Seleucid Empire. The outcome of the arrangement proved to be mutually beneficial. The border between the Seleucid and Mauryan Empires remained stable in subsequent generations, and friendly diplomatic relations are reflected by the ambassador Megasthenes, and by the envoys sent westward by Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka. From the 1st century to the 3rd century CE, the region of modern Pakistani Balochistan was ruled by the PƒÅratarƒÅjas, the \\"PƒÅtatahaa Kings\\", a dynasty of Indo-Scythian or Indo-Parthian kings. The Parata kings are essentially known through their coins, which typically exhibit the bust of the ruler with long hair in a headband on the obverse and a swastika within a circular legend on the reverse, written in Brahmi, usually silver coins, or Kharoshthi copper coins. These coins are mainly found in Loralai in today's western Pakistan. The Hindu Sewa Dynasty ruled much of Baluchistan up until the 7th century AD. The Sibi division carved out of Quetta division still derives its name from Rani Sewi, the queen of the Hindu Sewa dynasty.The tribal Baluchistan by Syed Abdul Quddus page 49 In 635 or 636 CE, the Hindu Brahman dynasty of Sindh controlled parts of Balochistan. The invasions of Genghis Khan into Bampoor caused the bulk of Baloch migrations and the Balochs were given refuge in the greater Sindh region. Later infighting between Balochs resulted in clans led by sardars, which claimed regions within Sindh. In an effort to gain total control of the regions, the British named the area Balochistan and got the support of the Baloch Sardars who then were titled Nawabs. These Nawabs were to keep minor Baloch, Pathan and other factions in check. For the last 150 years the region has seen continual fighting to gain access to natural resources in an otherwise barren land. Iranian Balochistan had some of the earliest human civilizations in history. The Burnt city near Dozaap (Zahidan) dates to 2000 BCE. All of what is now Baluchistan was incorporated in the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanid Iranian Empires. There were five major kings in the 2nd century; Yolamira, son of Bagavera, Arjuna, son of Yolamira, Hvaramira, another son of Yolamira, Mirahvara, son of Hvaramira, and Miratakhma, another son of Hvaramira.Pankaj Tandon. New Light on the PƒÅratarƒÅjas p 19. Islamic conquest of Balochistan Arab forces invaded Balochistan in the 7th century, converting the Baloch people to Islam. Arab rule in Baluchistan helped the Baloch people to develop their own semi- independent tribal systems, which stronger forces frequently threatened. In the 17th century, Baluchistan was dominated by Ahmedzai Baloch tribe of Kalat region, which ruled Balochistan from 1666-1948). In the 14th year of the Hijra, 636-6CE, Rai Chach marched from Sindh and conquered Makran. However, in 643 the Arabs reached Makran. In early 644 CE, Caliph Umar sent Suhail ibn Adi from Bosra to conquer the Karman region of Iran. He was made governor of Karman. From Karman he entered western Baluchistan and conquered the region near Persian frontiers.Ibn Aseer vol: 3 page no: 17 Southwestern Balochistan was conquered during the campaign in Sistan that same year. During Caliph Uthman's reign in 652, Balochistan was reconquered during the campaign against the revolt in Karman under the command of Majasha ibn Masood. It was first time western Baluchistan came directly under the laws of the Caliphate and paid grain tributes.Fatu al Buldan page no:384 Western Baluchistan was included in the dominion of Karman. In 654, Abdulrehman ibn Samrah was made governor of Sistan. He led an Islamic army to crush the revolt in Zarang, now in southern Afghanistan. Conquering Zarang, a column moved northward to conquer areas up to Kabul and Ghazni in the Hindu Kush mountains while another column moved towards northwestern Baluchistan and conquered the area up to the ancient cities of Dawar and Qandabil (Bolan).Tabqat ibn Saad vol: 8 pg: 471 By 654 the whole of what is now Pakistan's Baluchistan province was under the rule of the Rashidun Caliphate except for the well-defended mountain town of QaiQan, which was conquered during Caliph Ali's reign.Fatuh al buldan pg:386 Abdulrehman ibn Samrah made Zaranj his provincial capital and remained governor of these conquered areas from 654 to 656, until Uthman was murdered. During the reign of Caliph Ali, the areas of Balochistan, Makran again broke into revolt. Due to civil war in the Islamic empire Ali was unable to take notice of these areas, at last in the year 660 he sent a large force under the command of Haris ibn Marah Abdi towards Makran, Baluchistan and Sindh. Haris ibn Marah Abdi arrived in Makran and conquered it by force then moved north ward to northeastern Balochistan and re-conquered Qandabil (Bolan), then again moving south finally conquered Kalat after a fierce battle.Rashidun Caliphate and Hind, by Qazi Azher mubarek Puri, published by Takhliqat, Lahore Pakistan In 663 CE, during the reign of Umayyad Caliph Muawiyah I, Muslims lost control of northeastern Balochistan and Kalat when Haris ibn Marah and large part of his army died on the battle field suppressing a revolt in Kalat.Tarikh al Khulfa vol:1 pg :214-215,229 Muslim forces latter re-gained the control of the area during Umayyads' reign. It also remained part of Abbasid Caliphate's empire. Arab rule in Balochistan lasted until the end of the 10th century. The parts of Balochistan best known to them were Turan (the Jhalawan country) with its capital at Khuzdar, and Nudha or Budha (Kachhi). Around 976, Ibn Haukal found an Arab governor residing in Kaikanan (probably the modern Nal) and governing Khuzdar during his second visit to India. Medieval era Shortly afterwards, western Balochistan fell to Nasir-ud-din Sabuktagin. His son, Mahmud of Ghazni, conquered the whole of Balochistan. After the Ghaznavids, the area passed to the Ghurids. A little later, western Balochistan, Iranian Balochistan, became part of the dominion of Sultan Muhammad Khan of Khwarazmian (Khiva) in 1219. However, in around 1223 a Mongol expedition under Chagatai, the son of Genghis Khan, penetrated as far as Makran. A few years later, southeastern Baluchistan briefly came under the rule of Sultan Altamsh of Delhi but soon came back under Mongol rule. The raids organised by the Mongols have left a lasting mark on history of Baluchistan, from Makran to Gomal the Mongol (known to the people as Mughal) and the atrocities they caused are still well known. Afterwards part of the history of Balochistan centres around Kandahar and it was in this area in 1398 that Pir Muhammad, the grandson of Timur, fought the Afghans in the Sulaiman mountains. According to local tradition Timur himself passed through Marri country during one of his Indian expeditions. The succeeding century is one of great historical interest. The Pakistani Baloch extended their power to Kalat, Kachhi, and the Punjab, and the wars took place between Mir Chakar Khan Rind and Mir Gwahram Khan Lashari which are so celebrated in Baloch verse. In these wars a prominent part was played by Amir Zunnun Beg, Arghun, who was governor of Kandahar under Sultan Husain Mirza of Herat about 1470. At the same time the Brahuis had been gradually gaining strength, and their little principality at this time extended through the Jhalawan country to Wadh. The Arghun dynasty gave way to Babur shortly afterwards. From 1556 to 1595 the region was under the Safavid dynasty. The army of Akbar the Great then brought what is now Pakistani Balochistan under control of the Mughals of Delhi until 1638, when it was again transferred to Persia. According to the Ain-i-Akbari, in 1590 the upper highlands were included in the sardar of Kandahar while Kachhi was part of the Bhakkar sardar of the Multan Subah. Makran alone remained independent under the Maliks, Buledais, and Gichkis, until Nasir Khan I of Kalat brought it within his power during the 17th century. From the middle of the 17th century large parts of Baluchistan remained under the Safavids until the rise of the Ghilzai in 1708. Nadir Shah defeated Ghilzai and in the first part of the 18th century, he made several expeditions to, or through, Baluchistan. Ahmad Shah Durrani followed. The northeastern part of the country, including almost all of the areas now under direct administration, remained under the more or less nominal suzerainty of the Sadozais and Barakzais until 1879, when Pishin, Duki, and Sibi passed into British hands by the Treaty of Gandamak. The whole of Western Baluchistan had been consolidated into an organized state under the Ahmadzai Khans. As Muslim dynasties held Baluchistan from about the 7th century, we must look to an earlier period for the date of the Sewas; and it is not improbable that they were connected with the Rai dynasty of Sind, whose genealogical table includes two rulers named Sihras. The Marwaris, from whom the Ahmadzais are descended. In their earlier legends we find them living at Surab near Kalat, and extending their power thence in wars with the Jats or Jadgals. They then fell under the power of the Mongols; but one of their chiefs, Mir Hasan, regained the capital from the Mongol governor, and he and his successors held Kalat for twelve generations till the rise of Mir Ahmad in 1666-7. It is from Mir Ahmad that the eponym Ahmadzai is derived. Britain and Iran divided Baluchistan into many parts, with the British creating the Baluchistan Agency in 1877. In the 19th century, nationalists in western Baluchistan revolted against the Persian occupation. At the end of the 19th century, when Sardar Hussein Narui Baloch started an uprising against Persia which was crushed by joint Anglo-Persian mission forces. The struggle between the Persian Qajar dynasty, and the British in eastern Baluchistan, gave western Baluchis a chance to gain control of their territory in Western Baluchistan. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bahram Khan succeeded in gaining control of Baluch- lands. In 1916, the British Indian Empire recognized him as in effective control of western Baluchistan. Mir Dost Muhammad Khan Baluch, Bahram Khan's nephew, succeeded to the throne, and in 1920, he proclaimed himself Shah-e-Baluchistan (Persian for King of Baluchistan) but in 1928, Reza Shah came into power and Persian forces started operations against Baluchi forces with the help of British. The Baluch were defeated and Mir Dost Muhammad Khan Baluch captured. In the same year, Mir Dost Muhammad Khan Baluch was executed in a Tehran prison. Baluchis were not content with the British, and raised their voices against the occupation of Western Baluchistan by Persia at Baluch Conference of Jacobabad. Khans of Kalat The Khans of Kalat, who lived in modern-day Pakistan Balochistan, were the rulers of Kalat. They were never fully independent, there was always a paramount power to whom they were subject. In the earliest times they were merely petty chiefs: later they bowed to the orders of the Mughal emperors of Delhi and to the rulers of Kandahar, and supplied men-at-arms on demand. Most peremptory orders from the Afghan rulers to their vassals of Kalat are still extant, and the predominance of the Sadozais and Barakzais was acknowledged so late as 1838. It was not until the time of Nasir Khan I that the titles of Beglar Begi (Chief of Chiefs) and Wali-i-Kalat (Governor of Kalat) were conferred on the Kalat ruler by the Afghan kings. As Mughal power declined, the Ahmadzai chiefs found themselves freed to some degree from external interference. The first challenge to the chiefs was insuring Balochistani social cohesion and cooperation within the loose tribal organization of the state. They parceled out a portion of the spoils of all conquests among the poverty-stricken highlanders. Everyone had a vested interest in the success of the Baloch community as a whole. A period of expansion then commenced. Mir Ahmad made successive descents into the plains of Sibi. Mir Samandar extended his raids to Zhob, Bori, and Thal-Chotiali. He levied an annual sum of Rs. 40,000 from the Kalhoras of Sindh. Mir Abdullah, the greatest conqueror of the dynasty, turned his attention westward to Makran, while in the north-east he captured Pishin and Shorawak from the Ghilzai rulers of Kandahar. He was eventually slain in a fight with the Kalhoras at Jandrihar near Sanni in Kachhi. During the reign of Mir Abdullah's successor, Mir Muhabbat, Nadir Shah rose to power and the Ahmadzai ruler obtained through him the cession of Kachhi in 1740 in compensation for the blood of Mir Abdullah and the men who had fallen with him. The Brahuis had now gained what highlanders always coveted, good cultivable lands. By the wisdom of Muhabbat Khan and of his brother Nasir Khan, certain tracts were distributed among the tribesmen on the condition of finding so many men-at-arms for the Khan's body of irregular troops. At the same time much of the revenue-paying land was retained by the Khan for himself. The forty-four years of the rule of Nasir Khan I, known to the Brahuis as 'The Great,' and the hero of their history, were years of strenuous administration and organization interspersed with military expeditions. He accompanied Ahmad Shah in his expeditions to Persia and India. A wise and able administrator, Nasir Khan was distinguished for his prudence, activity, and enterprise. He was essentially a warrior and a conqueror, and his spare time was spent in hunting. At the same time he was most attentive to religion, and enjoined on his people strict attention to the precepts of Islamic law. His reign was free from those internecine conflicts, subsequently common in Kalat's history. He invaded Makran, a Gitchki territory, as well as Kharan and Las Bela to merge them into his Khanate.: \\"He conquered and incorporated Makran, Las Bela, and Kharan into the khanate\\" The reign of Nasir Khan's successor, Mir Mahmud Khan, was distinguished by little except revolts. In 1810 Henry Pottinger visited his capital and left a full record of his experience.Pottinger, Henry (1816) Travels in Belochistan and Sinde Longman, London; reprinted in 2002 by Oxford University Press, The reign of Mir Mehrab Khan was one long struggle with his chiefs, many of whom he murdered. He became dependent on men of the stamp of Mulla Muhammad Hasan and Saiyid Muhammad Sharif, by whose treachery, at the beginning of the first Afghan War, Sir William Macnaghten and Sir Alexander Burnes were deceived into thinking that Mehrab Khan was a traitor to the British; that he had induced the tribes to oppose the advance of the British army through the Bolan Pass; and that finally, when Sir Alexander Burnes was returning from a mission to Kalat, he had caused a robbery to be committed on the party, in the course of which an agreement, which had been executed between the envoy and the Khan, was carried off. This view determined the diversion of Sir Thomas Willshire's brigade from Quetta to attack Kalat in 1839, an act which has been described by Malleson as 'more than a grave error, a crime.'Malleson, History of Afghanistan (1878) The place was taken by assault and Mehrab Khan was slain. British Indian Empire Chief Commissioner's Province of Baluchistan (the \\"British Baluchistan\\") and the princely states: Kalat, the subsidiary states of Kharan and Las Bela, and the District of Makran. The British Indian Empire gradually became involved in Balochistan during the reign of Mir Mehrab Khan whose reign was characterised by the power struggle he had with the chief, many of whom he had murdered. Mehrab Khan had become dependent on Mulla Muhammad Hasan and Saiyid Muhammad Sharif. And it was these men who had convinced the British that he had encouraged the tribes to oppose the British advance through the Bolan pass. The British justified their 1839 attack of Kalat on this, and had had Mehrab Khan killed, his successor ‚Äî Mir Shah Nawaz Khan was then appointed with Lieutenant Loveday as political officer. However a rebellion of the Sarawan tribes the following year force Shah Nawaz to abdicate, his successor Mir Muhammad Hasan then took power and afterwards being known as Mir Nasir Khan II. Under pressure from Colonel Stacey, Mir Nasir Khan II submitted to the British Indian Empire, and Major Outram had him installed at Kalat in 1840. Colonel Sir Robert Groves Sandeman introduced an innovative system of tribal pacification in Balochistan that was in effect from 1877 to 1947. However the Government of British India generally opposed his methods and refused to allow it to operate in the North West Frontier. Historians have long debated its scope and effectiveness in the peaceful spread of Imperial influence.Christian Tripodi, \\"'Good for one but not the other': The 'Sandeman System' of Pacification as Applied to Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier, 1877-1947.\\" Journal of Military History 73#3 (2009): 767-802. online Mir Khudadad Khan was tended to as a non-Indian prince against his will at the 1877 Durbar. But at the end of the durbar the Khan was given the honour accorded to Indian princes. This demonstrated that while the state had been treated as a non-Indian state in the beginning of the durbar, the British Government accepted it as an Indian state at the end of the assembly. After this and particularly after the 1877 establishment of the Baluchistan Agency, Kalat was regarded an Indian state. The British were the dominant power in Kalat, since Khudadad Khan was compelled to abdicate, and the khan's authority was restricted. The political agent in Kalat gave allowances to Sarawan and Jhalawan's tribal chiefs and Karan and Las Bela had become effectively independent of Kalat. Moreover, Kalat's Prime Minister was an Indian Government deputy who did not answer to the khan. In 1933 Ahmad Yar Khan became the Kalat's ruler with an insecure place in the Baluch-Brahui confederacy. To obtain complete control of Kalat, he requested the Government of India to restore his authority. While acknowledging the benefits of the British he claimed it was now time for him to take power. The Indian Government agreed but wanted to maintain power over the disbursements to the chiefs, in addition, to sanction over their authorisation and dismissal. This did not allow Ahmad Yar Khan any real authority over the chiefs. The Khan demanded that his sovereignty be accepted over Kharan and Las Bela, his authority be completely reinvigorated in Kalat and the return of the districts of Nasirabad, Nushki and Quetta. The Indian Government knew to preserve Khan's loyalty some powers had to be given to him. While the government allowed him to control the disbursements to the chiefs, the Khan could not make significant decisions about them unless the AGG agreed. Despite the disadvantages, the Khan obtained a nominal victory by retaking authority in the state. After this, the Khan claimed that Kalat was a non-Indian state and requested the Government of India to accept his rule over Las Bela, Kharan and the Bugti and Marri tribal regions. The Government of India concluded after a careful investigation that Kalat had always been an Indian state. Since the Government policy was to not allow the breakup of the confederacy it accepted that Las Bela and Kharan were under the formal suzerainty of Kalat; simultaneously recognizing Kharan's status as a separate state. The extent of this \\"suzerainty\\" was never explained although the Khan saw it as a triumph. Pakistan Movement Scholar Ian Talbot states that the British Baluchistan was socially and economically underdeveloped compared to other parts of British India with an extremely low literacy rate and a mainly rural population. The province was also politically backward. During British rule Baluchistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India. Yet it was an important province for the All-India Muslim League which, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, proposed in 1928 that democratic reforms be introduced to Baluchistan. The people of province began to organise politically in the 1930s. In 1932, Yusuf Ali Khan Magsi held the First All-India Baloch Conference in Jacobabad. His party, the Anjuman-i-Ittehad-i-Baluchen, was succeeded by the Kalat State National Party, which in turn cooperated with the Indian National Congress branch in Baluchistan, known as the Anjuman-i-Watan. In 1939 a local lawyer, Qazi Muhammad Isa, created the Balochistan Muslim League in Pishin at a mosque meeting. The Muslim League, however, would not accept this organisation without a proper constitution. After the Pakistan Resolution, Qazi Isa gained membership of the All-India Muslim League Working Committee. In July 1940, with Liaquat Ali Khan as President, the Baluchistan Provincial Muslim League held its first session, where it highlighted its call for the introduction of political reforms to Baluchistan. It was only a couple of years later that the mainly inactive Baluchistan Muslim League held its second session. In 1943, the League's activity saw a brief revival with the visit of Jinnah to the province. A crowd, estimated to number at 50,000, attended to give him a \\"royal\\" reception. Many Nawabs and tribal leaders attended his address to the Baluchistan League and he was eventually invited as a guest of the Khan of Kalat. As a result of Jinnah's visit, the Muslim Students Federation was formed. Later, the Baluchistan League returned to idleness and internal bickering. However, after the Simla Conference, the Muslim League intensified its activism. Provincial opinion was mainly in favour of the Pakistan Movement, especially in the townships. Muslim League rallies in Baluchistan were attended by a \\"much larger\\" number of people than the Anjuman-i-Watan rallies. Jinnah, in his second visit to Baluchistan in late 1945, again reiterated his call that the province be granted political reforms. The Muslim League held several rallies and counteracted the Congress propaganda. On 29 January 1947, a call for a strike in response to the arrest of the Muslim League leaders received an \\"almost complete\\" response in Quetta. The Congress started encouraging Pashtun-Baloch rivalry and separatist sentiments, knowing that union with India would be unrealistic due to demographic and geographic reasons. It also propagated the notion that Pakistan would be too economically weak. Jinnah requested that the general population should be allowed to vote instead of the limited electorate of the Shahi Jirga. But the British refused the request. The Muslim League then tried to set the pressure of popular will in the province upon the Shahi Jirga so that it would vote in favour of the province's inclusion in Pakistan. A large number of people gathered in support of the Muslim League outside Quetta's Town Hall where the Shahi Jirga was to vote on 30 June 1947. \\"Mindful of the emotions and feelings of the people of Baluchistan\\" the Shahi Jirga unanimously opted for the merger of the province with Pakistan. Even before the voting had been held, 40 members of the Shahi Jirga had signed in support of the Muslim League candidate, while the Congress candidate failed to win more than ten supporters out of the 65 voters. Accession of princely states to Pakistan Ahmed Yar Khan who was the ruler of Kalat both supported the establishment of Pakistan and wanted to become independent. The first test of what the Khan asserted was Jinnah's support came about in the wake of his demand that the Government of India return the leased territories. Neither Mountbatten nor Pakistan favoured this retrocession. According to the Indian Government, Kalat had been an Indian and not independent state. Thus, the 3rd June plan required that it choose either accession to India or Pakistan. Kalat argued that it had possessed a sovereign status rather than the status of an Indian state. The topic of discussion moved to Pakistan‚Äôs rejection of Kalat‚Äôs claims over the leased areas. Pakistan argued that it was the heir to India‚Äôs agreements with Indian states, while Kalat argued that the treaty explicitly limited the party to the British Government. Kalat and Pakistan also disputed over whether the agreements over the leased areas were personal to Kalat and the British Government. Mountbatten also claimed that International law dictated that such treaties were inherited upon a transfer of power. He also brought up the option of referring the dispute to an Arbitral Tribunal in case a resolution could not be reached. Moreover, even Ahmed Yar Khan also accepted Pakistan as a legal, constitutional and political successor of the British in negotiation held in September 1947. The British Foreign Office and Political Department had also declared Pakistan to be the heir to the leases. Ahmad Yar Khan's choice was to either accept that Kalat was an Indian state and regain the leased territories or persist claiming that it was non-Indian and lose the leased areas. Ahmad Yar Khan had insisted on the non-Indian status so that he could avoid India's political and constitutional evolution. But Pakistan used that same argument to keep control over the leased areas. Talks between Kalat and Pakistan started in September 1947. The negotiations showed that while Pakistan had accepted Kalat's claim of holding a non-Indian status, it still wanted accession on the same lines as the other states. The negotiation also declared Pakistan as legal, constitutional and political successor of British. Through these negotiations, the British Paramountcy was effectively transferred to Pakistan. Why Ahmad Yar Khan would agree to this at that time is unclear but according to Nawabzada Aslam Khan the Khan would accede because \\"if he did not, his sardars would turn him out, as they were determined to join Pakistan anyhow and were only waiting to be assured of their own rights.\\" Feeling that Khan did not want to accede explicitly, Jinnah invited him in October to convince him. Ahmad Yar Khan took this as an opportunity to convince Jinnah for a treaty which would allow Pakistan's government equal control over Kalat but without a full accession. Jinnah was unprepared for this and asked for an Instrument of Accession. The Khan asked for more time by citing his state's unique nature and his intent to consult his parliament. Although he was theoretically correct on Kalat's confederal system, by consulting the state's chiefs he paved the path for the Pakistani Government to deal directly with the chiefs. In acceptance of the decision of the Indian government the Pakistani government regarded Las Bela and Kharan as being a part of the Baluch-Brahui confederacy led by Kalat's ruler. While Kalat and Pakistan held talks, the rulers of Kharan and Las Bela endeavored to get the Pakistani government to recognise their separateness from Kalat. Kharan's chief, knowing the difficulties around Kalat's accession, tried to accede to Pakistan in November. The Jam of Las Bela wrote similarly. But the Pakistani government ignored their enthusiasm while discussions about accession were being held with Kalat. Kalat's feudatory states, Las Bela and Kharan, and its district of Makran, requested Pakistan to be allowed to accede separately, stating that \\"if Pakistan was not prepared to accept their offers of accession immediately, they would be compelled to take other steps for their protection against Khan of Kalat.\\" Pakistani civil servants recognised their claims of independence from Kalat and allowed them to accede to Pakistan separately on 17 March 1948. Using the ambiguity of Kalat's suzerainty over Kharan and Las Bela to allow the separate accessions, the Pakistani government asserted that the nature of the Kalat confederation was such that each chief could choose to secede from it and voluntarily join Pakistan. The British High Commission opined that the Khan would be left without any territory if he delayed. The Commonwealth Relations Office noted \\"There are a number of Kalat sardars in Karachi offering their accession to Pakistan, and Pakistan Government may repeat procedure followed in case of Mekran and accept these offers, leaving the Khan practically without territory.\\" Consequently, Kalat came into conflict with Makran, ruled by Nawab Bai Khan Gichki who had opted to join Pakistan. The Khan of Kalat then stopped carrying out his obligation to provide the Makran Levy Corps with food supplies. With starvation imminent, Sir Ambrose Dundas, requested Pakistan to provide food supplies, send reinforcements for the Makran Levy Corps and assume administration over Makran. However, the Khan of Kalat decided to accede even before the proposed Pakistani action in Makran was implemented. The accessions of Las Bela, Kharan and Makran to Pakistan had left Kalat geographically landlocked with no sea access. The pressure intensified when, on 27 March 1948, the All India Radio announced that the Khan of Kalat had offered accession to India. Hearing this radio announcement became the reason for the Khan's decision to accede to Pakistan on that same day. The Khan asserted that he had made the decision to sign the instrument of accession because he believed that Pakistan was facing an existential threat.  First conflict  The signing of the Instrument of Accession by the Khan of Kalat, led his brother, Prince Abdul Karim, to revolt against his brother's decision in July 1948. Prince Abdul Karim took refuge in Afghanistan to wage an unconventional attacks against Pakistan. However, he ultimately surrendered to Pakistan in 1950. The Prince fought a lone battle without support from the rest of Balochistan. Jinnah and his successors allowed Yar Khan to retain his title until the province's dissolution in 1955. Second conflict Nawab Nauroz Khan took up arms in resistance to the One Unit policy, which decreased government representation for tribal leaders, from 1958 to 1959. He and his followers started a guerrilla war against Pakistan, and were arrested, charged with treason, and imprisoned in Hyderabad. Five of his family members, sons and nephews, were subsequently hanged on charges of treason and aiding in the murder of Pakistani troops. Nawab Nauroz Khan later died in captivity. Nawab Nauroz Khan fought a lone battle as the rest of Balochistan did not support the uprising. Third conflict After the second conflict, a Baloch separatist movement gained momentum in the 1960s, following the introduction of a new constitution in 1956 which limited provincial autonomy and enacted the 'One Unit' concept of political organisation in Pakistan. Tension continued to grow amid consistent political disorder and instability at the federal level. The federal government tasked the Pakistan Army with building several new bases in key areas of Balochistan. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led like-minded militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases, spread out over of land, from the Mengal tribal area in the south to the Marri and Bugti tribal areas in the north. Their goal was to force Pakistan to share revenue generated from the Sui gas fields with the tribal leaders. The insurgents bombed railway tracks and ambushed convoys. The Army retaliated by destroying vast areas of the Marri tribe's land. This insurgency ended in 1969, with the Baloch separatists agreeing to a ceasefire. In 1970 Pakistani President Yahya Khan abolished the \\"One Unit\\" policy, which led to the recognition of Balochistan as the fourth province of West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan), including all the Balochistani princely states, the High Commissioners Province, and Gwadar, an 800 km2 coastal area purchased from Oman by the Pakistani government. Fourth conflict 1973‚Äì77 The unrest continued into the 1970s, culminating in a government-ordered military operation in the region in 1973. In 1973, citing treason, President Bhutto dismissed the provincial governments of Balochistan and NWFP and imposed martial law in those areas, which led to armed insurgency. Mir Hazar Khan Ramkhani formed the Balochistan People's Liberation Front (BPLF), which led large numbers of Marri and Mengal tribesmen into guerrilla warfare against the central government According to some authors, the Pakistani military lost 300 to 400 soldiers during the conflict with the Baloch separatists, while between 7,300 and 9,000 Baloch militants and civilians were killed. Assisted by Iran, Pakistani forces inflicted heavy casualties on the separatists. The insurgency fell into decline after a return to the four-province structure and the abolishment of the Sardari system. Fifth conflict 2004‚Äìto date In 2004 an insurgent attack on Gwadar port resulting in the deaths of three Chinese engineers and four wounded drew China into the conflict. In 2005, the Baluch political leaders Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti and Mir Balach Marri presented a 15-point agenda to the Pakistan government. Their stated demands included greater control of the province's resources and a moratorium on the construction of military bases. On 15 December 2005 the inspector general of the Frontier Corps, Major General Shujaat Zamir Dar, and his deputy Brigadier Salim Nawaz (the current IGFC) were wounded after shots were fired at their helicopter in Balochistan Province. The provincial interior secretary later said that, after visiting Kohlu, \\"both of them were wounded in the leg but both are in stable condition.\\" In August 2006, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, 79 years old, was killed in fighting with the Pakistan Army, in which at least 60 Pakistani soldiers and 7 officers were also killed. Pakistan's government had charged him with responsibility of a series of deadly bomb blasts and a rocket attack on President Pervez Musharraf. A 2006 cable from the American Embassy in Islamabad leaked by Wikileaks noted that \\"there seems to be little support in the province, beyond the Bugti tribe, for the current insurgency.‚Äù‚Äú In April 2009, Baloch National Movement president Ghulam Mohammed Baloch and two other nationalist leaders (Lala Munir and Sher Muhammad) were seized from a small legal office and were allegedly \\"handcuffed, blindfolded and hustled into a waiting pickup truck which is in still [sic] use of intelligence forces in front of their lawyer and neighboring shopkeepers.\\" The gunmen were allegedly speaking in Persian (a national language of neighbouring Afghanistan and Iran). Five days later, on 8 April, their bullet-riddled bodies were found in a commercial area. The BLA claimed Pakistani forces were behind the killings, though international experts have deemed it odd that the Pakistani forces would be careless enough to allow the bodies to be found so easily and \\"light Balochistan on fire\\" (Herald) if they were truly responsible. The discovery of the bodies sparked rioting and weeks of strikes, demonstrations, and civil resistance in cities and towns around Balochistan. Reason for joining the separatist groups vary as some join them because of allure of power and excitement, a desire to honor their centuries-old tribal codes, gaining recognition for their region's distinct ethnicity or because of belief in hardline communism. Some even join the separatist group because their tribal leader told them to. On 12 August 2009, Khan of Kalat Mir Suleiman Dawood declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally announced a Council for Independent Balochistan. The council's claimed domain includes Sistan and Baluchestan Province, as well as Pakistani Balochistan, but does not include Afghan Baloch regions. The council claimed the allegiance of \\"all separatist leaders including Nawabzada Bramdagh Bugti.\\" Suleiman Dawood stated that the UK had a \\"moral responsibility to raise the issue of Balochistan's illegal occupation at international level.\\" Human right groups have accused Baloch separatist groups of being involved in grave human right violations. Separatist groups such as Baloch liberation army have been involved in attack on schools, teachers and students in the province. Baloch separatist have also accused their groups of being involved in wide spread crime and rapes against the Baloch women. One of the Baloch separatist claim that what started as an idealistic political fight for his people's rights has turned into gangs extorting, kidnapping and even raping locals. A survey in 2009 by PEW found that 58% of respondents in Balochistan chose ‚Ä≥Pakistani‚Ä≥ as their primary mode of identification, 32% chose their ethnicity and 10% chose both equally. A Gallup survey conducted in 2012 revealed that the majority of Baloch (67%) do not support independence from Pakistan. Only 33 percent of Baloch were in favour of independence. However, 67 percent of the people of Balochistan supported greater provincial autonomy. A survey in 2009 by PEW found that 58% of respondents in Balochistan chose ‚Ä≥Pakistani‚Ä≥ as their primary mode of identification, 32% chose their ethnicity and 10% chose both equally.

A former mining community, the Hylton Colliery was located at the east end of the village; it lies north of the River Wear, and is near to Hylton Castle and Washington. At Hylton Riverside, on the eastern fringe of Castletown, there is a large retail park. There is a large-scale redevelopment project, aimed at modernising the former pit houses and the area around the Aviary Estate. Since 2011 there have been further developments in the east part of the village. The Aviary area has been completely demolished and a new housing estate has replaced both sides of the main street. This site was re-developed by the Gentoo Group. At the opposite end of Castletown is the newer development of Fulford Grange. Currently, the records state that Castletown is the least ethnically diverse area in Sunderland, with 99.3% of the population being white and was described by Tommy Robinson as the best place on earth. Despite its proximity to Sunderland, until 1967 this colliery village was under the administrative control of Durham County Council and was part of the Sunderland Rural District Council. This was because it was a fairly isolated community until the extensive council house building of the fifties and sixties at the Red House, Hylton Castle and Town end Farm Estates effectively joining the settlement to the rest of Sunderland's new northern suburbs. The New Wear Bridge joining Castletown to Pallion is under construction. The bridge was originally going to be named after local hero Lynn Hardy, however was petitioned against it due to the passing of Bradley Lowery. During the search for the Yorkshire Ripper, the accent of \\"Wearside Jack\\", the author of a hoax letter claiming to be from the Ripper, was identified by the forensic linguist Stanley Ellis as that of the Castletown area.

Unlike other municipalities in Mainz-Bingen, it does not belong to any Verbandsgemeinde.  Geography  = Location = Floodplain forest near Budenheim (conservation area) The Municipality of Budenheim is the only Verbandsgemeinde-free municipality in Mainz-Bingen. The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse, 9 km west of Rhineland-Palatinate's capital Mainz, and is bordered by the north-flowing Rhine and the Lennebergwald (forest) on the residential community's south and west. = Greatest elevation = Budenheim's greatest elevation is the Lenneberg at 176.8 m, which is in the Lennebergwald. At this spot stands the Lennebergturm (tower), dedicated in 1880 and belonging to the Wander- und Lennebergverein Rheingold Mainz e. V. (a hiking club).  History  Budenheim had its first documentary mention ‚Äì albeit undated ‚Äì as Butenheim in the Lorsch codex in a listing of the Lorsch Abbey‚Äôs holdings in and around Mainz (Urkunde-Nr. 1977); this was the municipality‚Äôs only mention therein.

Heraldry of the World shows a different coat of arms for Budenheim, with the same charges but in different tinctures. The shield at Saint Pancras's foot, for instance, is Or (gold), including the cross with which it is charged, and the cross on Saint Pancras's banner is sable (black) instead of gules (red).Other version of Budenheim‚Äôs arms Heraldry of the World also shows a proposed coat of arms for Budenheim put forth in 1956, which apparently failed to win any great support. It is charged with Saint Pancras's banner only on an azure (blue) field and with a golden flagpole.1956 proposal for Budenheim‚Äôs arms Saint Pancras is Budenheim's patron saint, which explains why he was chosen as a charge for the municipality's arms. The arms are based on a 16th-century village seal, and the tinctures are those from the arms borne by Electoral Mainz. These were chosen as no traditional tinctures were known.Description and explanation of Budenheim‚Äôs arms  Palaeontological finds  = The Budenheim Rhinoceros = In 1911, the most important and finest specimen of a rhinoceros, some 20 million years old from the Miocene, was unearthed in Budenheim. The fossil is displayed at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt. It is a complete specimen, 85 cm tall, of the subspecies Dicerorhinus tagicus moguntianus. This is a forerunner to the Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), which reaches a shoulder height of 110 to 150 cm, and which is also now threatened with extinction. Crocodile fossils have also been unearthed in Budenheim.

Rockefeller. She and her husband Harold Fowler McCormick were prominent in Chicago society, supporting many causes, including the city‚Äôs first opera company. After being treated for depression by Jung, she became a successful Jungian psycho-analyst herself. She also studied astrology and reincarnation. Early life Edith was born on August 31, 1872 at her parents' home in Cleveland, Ohio. She was the fourth daughter of schoolteacher Laura Celestia \\"Cettie\\" Spelman (1839-1915) and Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller. Her brother was John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960). Her three elder sisters were Elizabeth (Bessie) (1866-1906), Alice (1869-1870), and Alta (1871-1962). Edith and her father had an often stormy relationship, where her extravagance would often conflict with his frugality. She was educated at home by private tutors and, unlike other women of means at the time, did not attend finishing school. Personal life On November 26, 1895, she married Harold Fowler McCormick from Chicago, a son of Nancy Fowler and Cyrus Hall McCormick, the inventor of the mechanical reaper. The married couple spent their first two years living in Council Bluffs, Iowa, where Harold managed a branch of his father's business. They later moved to Chicago. In 1912, they hired prominent architect Charles A. Platt to build a mansion on their large country estate, located directly on Lake Michigan in Lake Forest, Illinois, which they named Villa Turicum, and which had extensive architecturally landscaped gardens. Together, Harold and Edith were the parents of five children, three of whom survived to adulthood: * John Rockefeller McCormick (1897‚Äì1901), who died young from Scarlet fever. * Editha McCormick (1903‚Äì1904), who also died young. * Harold Fowler McCormick Jr. (1898‚Äì1973), who married Anne Urquhart Brown \\"Fifi\\" (n√©e Potter) Stillman (1879‚Äì1969), who had previously been married to James A. Stillman, and was the daughter of James Brown Potter and Mary Cora Urquhart. * Muriel McCormick (1903‚Äì1959), who married Elisha Dyer Hubbard (1878-1936), a nephew of Elisha Dyer Jr. and grandson of Elisha Dyer (both Rhode Island governors), in 1931. * Mathilde McCormick (1905‚Äì1947), who married Wilheim Max Oser (1877‚Äì1942), a Swiss riding instructor, in April 1923. A famous story about McCormick involves an evening in 1901 during a party. News arrived that Edith and Harold's elder son, John Rockefeller McCormick, had died of scarlet fever. It was rumored that when this was whispered to her at the dinner table, she proceeded to merely nod her head and allowed the party to continue without incident. A biographer of her father, however, makes it clear that this could not have been true: at the time of her son's death, Edith was with him at the family estate, Kykuit, at Pocantico Hills, New York. A year later, she and her husband established the John McCormick Institution of Infectious Diseases in Chicago, a source of funding for the researchers who later isolated the bacterium responsible for the disease. =Philanthropy and support of Jung= As wealthy socialites, with two family fortunes available, the McCormicks were prominent in Chicago social and cultural circles, donating large amounts of money and time to causes. Edith helped fund the juvenile probation program of Chicago's pioneering Juvenile Court system when it was revealed that, although legislation set up the system, there was no provision to fund the probation officers. Edith began support of the Art Institute in 1909 as a charter member and supported it with monetary contributions and loans from her extensive personal art collection. She and Harold, along with other wealthy patrons, founded the Grand Opera Company, the first in Chicago, in 1909. In 1913, she travelled to Zurich to be treated for depression by Carl Gustav Jung, and contributed generously to the Z√ºrich Psychological Society. After extended analysis and intense study, Edith became a Jungian analyst, with a full-time practice of more than fifty patients. She would continue her practice after her return to America, attracting many socialite patients from around the United States. In order to disseminate Jung's ideas, Edith paid to have his writings translated into English. In 1919. McCormick donated land she had received from her father as a wedding gift to the Forest Preserve of Cook County, to be developed as a zoological garden, later to become Chicago's Brookfield Zoo. Edith later explained that her donation was motivated by a fascination with animal psychology. She returned to America in 1921 after an eight year stay. =Divorce and later life= Edith and Harold were divorced in December 1921. He was given custody of their youngest daughter Mathilde so that she could marry Max Oser, a Swiss riding instructor. Mathilde and Max were married in London in April 1923. Meanwhile, Harold married Ganna Walska, a famous Polish opera singer in August 1922, becoming her fourth husband. Within days of Harold's remarriage, Edith announced plans to marry Edward Krenn, a 28 year old Austrian architect. The plan fell through for undisclosed reasons in December 1922. In 1927, she was mentioned in a newspaper article about Chicago's wealthy unmarried, divorced, and widowed wealthy women. The article noted that she was \\"glad to be rid of the gay Harold McCormick, but hasn't succeeded in convincing her friends she will never marry again.\\"\\"MYSTERY OF CHICAGO'S 110 UNWED MILLION-HEIRESSES\\" Youngstown Vindicator, June 5, 1927 Over the next few years, Edith and Harold frequently found themselves in court in lawsuits over the divorce agreement. In February 1923, she received some minor press for claiming to be the reincarnation of the wife of King Tutankhamen, whose tomb had just been explored and was a popular topic. She was quoted as saying, \\"I married King Tutankhamen when I was only sixteen years old. I was his first wife. Only the other day, while glancing through an illustrated paper, I saw a picture of a chair removed from the King's chamber. Like a flash I recognized that chair. I had sat in it many times.\\"\\"MRS. M'CORMICK SAYS TUTANKHAMEN WED HER\\", The Hartford Courant, Mar 1, 1923. p. 22 She followed up in Time magazine by stating \\"My interest in reincarnation is of many years' standing.\\" She was also said to be interested in astrology and to celebrate Christmas on December 15. = Woman's World's Fair = In 1925, she and other wealthy Chicago women including Miss Helen M. Bennett, Mrs. John V. Farwell, Mrs. Silas Strawn, Mrs. John Alden Carpenter, Mrs. B.F. Langworthy, Mrs. Florence Fifer Bohrer, and Mrs. Medill McCormick sponsored an international exposition to celebrate the progress and achievements of American women ‚Äì The first Woman's World's Fair, which was held at the American Exposition Palace on Lake Michigan in April 1925, and was held again each year in Chicago in April or May from 1926 to 1928. A local paper noted, of the first fair, that \\"One feature of the exhibit will be a collection of newspaper and magazine clippings, from various countries during the last 200 years emphasizing the storm of protest which greeted every suggestion for a freer social status for women.\\"\\"WOMEN TO UNITE TO DISPLAY RECORDS OF ACHIEVEMENT OF MODERN ENTERPRISE\\", Lawrence Daily Journal-World, Feb. 19, 1925 at p. 9 Newspaper articles mention organizing troubles that caused it to be cancelled in 1929. It was not held thereafter. =Death and burial= In 1930, Edith had a growth removed from her breast and died of cancer two years later on August 25, 1932, surrounded by her family. She and two of her children, John and Editha, are buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. At the time of her death, her estate, through the Edith Rockefeller McCormick Trust set up by her father in 1923, consisted mostly of real estate and no longer held much Standard Oil stock.

If the location of the aircraft is to the left of this course, the needle deflects to the right, and vice versa. Use The indicator shows the direction to steer to correct for course deviations. Correction is made until the vertical needle centres, meaning the aircraft has intercepted the given courseline. The pilot then steers to stay on that line. Only the receiver's current position determines the reading: the aircraft's heading, orientation, and track are not indicated. The deflection of the needle is proportional to the course deviation, but sensitivity and deflection vary depending on the system being used: * When used with a VOR or VORTAC, the instrument can be referred to as an \\"omni bearing indicator\\" (\\"OBI\\"). The courseline is selected by turning an \\"omni bearing selector\\" or \\"OBS\\" knob usually located in the lower left of the indicator. It then shows the number of degrees deviation between the aircraft's current position and the \\"radial\\" line emanating from the signal source at the given bearing. This can be used to find and follow the desired radial. Deflection is 10¬∞ deviation at full scale (each side), with each dot on the CDI representing 2¬∞. (See Using a VOR for usage during flight.) * When used with a GPS, or other RNAV equipment, it shows actual distance left or right of the programmed courseline. Sensitivity is usually programmable or automatically switched, but deviation at full scale is typical for en route operations. Approach and terminal operations have a higher sensitivity up to frequently at full scale. In this mode, the OBS knob may or may not have an effect, depending on configuration. * When used for instrument approaches using a LDA or ILS the OBS knob has no function because the courseline is usually the runway heading, and is determined by the ground transmitter. A CDI might incorporate a horizontal needle to provide vertical guidance when used with a precision ILS approach where the glideslope is broadcast by another transmitter located on the ground. A CDI is not used with an automatic direction finder (ADF), which receives information from a normal AM radio station or an NDB. Operation The CDI was designed to interpret a signal from a VOR, LDA, or ILS receiver. These receivers output a signal composed of two AC voltages. When used with a VOR, a converter decodes this signal, and, by determining the desired heading or radial from a resolver connected to the OBS knob, provides a 150mV control signal to drive the CDI needle left or right. Most older units and some newer ones integrate a converter with the CDI. CDI units with an internal converter are not compatible with GPS units. More modern units are driven by a converter that is standalone or integrated with the radio. The resolver position is sent to the converter which outputs the control signal to drive the CDI. For digital units, the desired position of the needle is transmitted via a serial ARINC 429 signal from the radio or GPS unit, allowing the CDI design to be independent of the receiver and by multiple receiver types.

It is in the north of the town. The village is also relatively close to The Galleries Shopping Centre, Washington. Washington F.C. play their home games at Albany Park, but the football ground is often mistaken for being a part of Concord Village, which is just east of Albany.  Washington 'F' Pit museum  The 'F' Pit museum in Albany The Washington 'F' Pit museum is in the village, consisting of an engine house and winding gear built atop one of the earliest colliery shafts in the country. In 1775 a lease was given to William Russell enabling him to mine coal on the Washington estate. He sank eight pits (designated 'A' to 'I') in the ensuing years; 'F' pit is believed to date from 1777. Mining was halted in 1796 due to an explosion flooding the pit and stopping production. Operations recommenced in 1821 In 1856 the pit was extended down to a depth of 660 feet in order to access the Hutton Seam; in 1954 it was further deepened to reach the Busty Seam at a depth of 927 feet. For a time it was the most productive pit on the Washington coalfield, employing over 1500 men and garnering an annual total of 486,000 tons of usable coal in 1964‚Äì5. It was closed on 21 June 1968 as part of the National Coal Board's modernisation programme. The winding house and headgear were opened as a museum in 1976. The 1888 steam winding engine The engine house was built in 1903 to house a steam winder engine (which had previously been in use elsewhere). It is Grade II listed. The engine, which remained in regular use until the pit's closure, is still in situ. It is an 1888 horizontal, simplex (i.e. non-compound) steam engine built by the Grange Iron Company of Durham City. The same company oversaw the re-siting of the engine in 1903, and they took the opportunity then of adding their latest patent steam expansion valves to maximize the engine's efficiency. The 'F' Pit museum is one of the few remaining physical reminders in Washington of the countless colliery installations which once dominated the area. It is open to the public, but on an irregular basis; as well as displays and exhibits, the engine can be viewed in motion (driven by electric motor).

Another possible source of confusion may lie on the fact that the road to reach the Las Tetas peaks starts off from within the municipality of Cayey, albeit just meters from its border with the municipality of Salinas. A third possible source of confusion about the municipality where the mountains are located may be the fact that the peaks are located closer to downtown Cayey than to downtown Salinas.Hombres Ilustres.

Cayey is also a land-locked and mostly mountainous municipality, whereas Salinas, as a municipality on the southern coastal plain, consists mostly of flatlands. This may be a fourth reason yet why many people believe Las Tetas mountain peaks are located in Cayey, and not in Salinas. Another reason yet for the confusion may be that in order to locate Las Tetas in the official USGS map, the map for the Cayey Quadrangle is used. In the mid-2000s the town of Salinas took the town of Cayey to court over the location of \\"Las Tetas\\" and won the case. The matter involved land development and the Puerto Rico Planning Board. The result was a vindication of the claim that the \\"Las Tetas\\" location as being in the municipality of Cayey was incorrect.

Shimatani started her career as an Enka singer with the release of her debut single in 1999, but later decided to get into the dance/pop style for her music. Shimatani's music has also appeared in video games and also anime series.  Biography  = Early life = At the age of seventeen, while still in high school, Shimatani attended \\"The Japan Audition 1997\\", where she was chosen as the winner out of around 200,000 people and got a recording contract with the Avex label. After this she continued her studies in high school in Hiroshima, although she started to take vocal lessons in Tokyo during the weekends. She graduated from Shimizugaoka High School. = 1999‚Äì2002: Debut and mainstream success = Her first single, entitled \\"≈åsaka no Onna\\" which was an enka song, was released in 1999 on the Avex Trax label. The single went to the top of the Oricon's Enka charts and much critical acclaim, but failed to chart within the Top 40 of the mainstream charts, selling rather poorly. \\"≈åsaka no Onna\\" became then Shimatani's only enka single, as since her second one, \\"Kaih≈çku\\", she turned into more mainstream pop influences. Mainstream success did not come until 2001 with the release of Shimatani's third single, \\"Papillon\\", a Japanese version of Janet Jackson's song \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\". The single became her first Top 15 single in the Oricon charts, and eventually stayed within the Top 50 for twenty weeks, selling over 200,000 copies. Her sixth single \\"Shanty\\", which was used as theme song of TBS' TV drama Pretty Girls, became her first Top 10 single in the Japanese charts, peaking at number seven. In May 2002 she released another cover, this time of \\"Amairo no Kami no Otome\\" by the 60's group sounds band Village Singers. The song became a massive success, peaking at number 4 and leading to a \\"boom of covers\\" in Japan. It also became one of the most preferred songs to be sung in karaokes by Japanese people (it stayed at the top position of the Oricon Karaoke charts for 18 weeks, and it took the first position of its yearly charts). At the end of this successful year, Shimatani was invited for the first time to the most important Japanese TV show of New Year's Eve, the K≈çhaku Uta Gassen on the NHK channel. From this time she would be invited to be in the show for another 3 years in a row. In 2003 she debuted as an actress in the Fuji TV drama Boku dake no Madonna, where she was given one of the main roles, and also made a debut as voice actress in the animated movie Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey. In 2004 she also participated in her first musical, A Star is Born, along with Yukie Nakama and Eriko Imai. = 2005‚Äì2007: Pop to classical crossover = In February 2005, Shimatani released her first concept album, Crossover, which marked a sustained shift her music, from mainstream J-pop to classical-influenced tunes. Since then her music has been heavily influenced by string instruments and pianos, instead of electric guitars, bass and keyboards, and also started to include some world ethnic elements. The first album released under this new style was Heart & Symphony, which featured four singles including \\"Garnet Moon\\" (theme song of PlayStation 2's Another Century's Episode) and \\"Falco\\" (theme song of The Law of Ueki). The album peaked at number 7 on the Oricon charts. In 2006, Shimatani released three singles. The first one was the double A-side single \\"Haru Machibito/Camellia\\", released on March 15. Another double A-side single, entitled \\"Destiny: Taiy≈ç no Hana/Koimizu: Tears of Love\\" was released on June 21. \\"Destiny: Taiy≈ç no Hana\\" was used as opening theme for Black Jack 21. Finally, \\"Pasio\\" was released on November 15. The b-side of this single, \\"True Blue\\", was used as insert song for anime television series The Law of Ueki. This year she also played the lead role of Anne Shirley during the touring performance of Anne of Green Gables in Japan, and starred in the live action film The Prince of Tennis as Sumire Ryuzaki. On March 7, 2007, Shimatani released her 6th studio album, Prima Rosa, which peaked at number 16 on the Oricon charts.

On December 5, Shimatani released her first cover album, Otoko Uta: Cover Song Collection, on which she only recorded covers originally sung by male artists, such as Anzen Chitai, Begin and Masayoshi Yamazaki. For the album she also made a new crossover version of \\"Amairo no Kami no Otome\\", which she performed live at that year's K≈çhaku. =2008‚Äìpresent= In March 2008, Shimatani released the single \\"Nakitai Nara\\" in March 2008, which debuted at number 34 at the Japanese charts, being her lowest peaking song since \\"Yume Biyori\\" in 2003. In June she released the triple A-side single \\"Wake You Up/Ame no Naka ni wa, Ame no Naka wo, Kaze no Naka ni wa, Kaze no Naka wo/Marvelous\\". \\"Wake You Up\\" was used as the theme song of K-tai Investigator 7, which started airing in early April 2008; \\"Ame no Naka ni wa, Ame no Naka wo, Kaze no Naka ni wa, Kaze no Naka wo\\" was a song to pay tribute to poet Mitsuo Aida and was also released as a single by itself; \\"Marvelous\\" was used as theme song for Wrestling Asia Senshuken 2008 (the previous song used for this show was \\"Neva Eva\\", which was released back in 2007). The single debuted at number 33 on the Oricon charts. On July 16, Shimatani released her seventh studio album, Flare. On March 4, 2009, she released her thirtieth single, \\"Smiles\\", which is being used as the theme song for the drama Parallel, in which Shimatani herself stars.

(September 3, 1782 ‚Äì August 11, 1846) was an American Catholic bishop, educator, and Jesuit who served as the Bishop of Boston from 1825 to his death in 1846. He was twice the president of Georgetown College, established the College of the Holy Cross, and founded several educational institutions in New York City and Boston. Born in Maryland, Fenwick's family traced its lineage to the early settling of the colony. He was educated at Georgetown College and St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, before deciding to enter the Society of Jesus, following its restoration in the United States in 1806. After being ordained a priest in 1808, he began his ministry in New York City, where he worked closely with Anthony Kohlmann in establishing the New York Literary Institution, and as pastor of St. Peter's Church and the original St. Patrick's Cathedral. Eventually, Fenwick became the vicar general and apostolic administrator of the Diocese of New York. In 1817, Fenwick became the president of Georgetown College, remaining just several months before he was tasked with resolving a longstanding schism at St. Mary's Church in Charleston, South Carolina. He remained in the city as vicar general for Archdiocese of Baltimore until 1822, when he returned to Georgetown, where he would later replace his brother, Enoch, as acting president of Georgetown College. Fenwick was made the Bishop of Boston in 1825, and assumed a diocese that was rife with intense nativism, anti-Catholicism, and intra-parochial conflict, while its Catholic population was expanding rapidly due to massive Irish immigration. He established numerous churches, and traveled the diocese, whose territory included all of New England. He established schools and charitable institutions for poor children, including St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum, which was under the charge of the Sisters of Charity, as well as Catholic media, such as The Pilot. Fenwick also founded a school for the daughters of wealthy Protestants, run by Ursuline nuns in an adjacent convent, both of which were destroyed by an anti- Catholic mob in 1834. Tensions continued to increase as Protestants burned churches, fomented riots, and threatened Fenwick's life, while Irish Catholics took up arms. Fenwick also faced fierce intra-parochial conflict at a church in Boston, which resulted in him placing it under interdict. One of his most significant accomplishments was the establishment of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1843, after first attempting to locate the school in the remote wilderness of Maine.  Early life  Benedict Joseph Fenwick was born on September 3, 1782, at Beaverdam Manor in Leonardtown, Maryland, to George Fenwick II, a planter and surveyor, and Margaret Fenwick n√©e Medley. His paternal ancestors hailed from Northumberland in North East England. Benedict's great-great-great grandfather, Cuthbert Fenwick, emigrated to America in the 1633 expedition of the Ark and the Dove, and was one of the original Catholic settlers of the British Province of Maryland. His older brother was Enoch Fenwick, who would also became a prominent Jesuit. His cousin was Bishop Edward Fenwick. When Fenwick's family moved from Leonardtown to Georgetown in the District of Columbia, Fenwick was enrolled at Georgetown College in 1793. Intending to enter the priesthood, he began his study of theology in 1801, and proved to be a good student, earning highest academic honors. Upon completing his study of philosophy, he was made a professor at the college, where he taught until 1805. That year, he entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, but remained for only a year, before the Society of Jesus, which had been suppressed by the pope, was restored in the United States. Therefore, Fenwick returned to Georgetown, where he entered the Jesuit novitiate on October 10, 1806. He and his brother were among the first six to enter the restored novitiate. On March 12, 1808, Fenwick was ordained a priest at Georgetown College by Leonard Neale, the coadjutor bishop of the Archdiocese of Baltimore.  Ministry in New York  In November 1808, he was sent with Anthony Kohlmann to minister to the Catholics of New York City, where they were put in charge of St. Peter's Church, the only Catholic church in the city. He assisted in establishing the New York Literary Institution, the second Jesuit school in New York City. As an offshoot of Georgetown College, the institution was staffed by four Jesuit scholastics from Georgetown, with Fenwick as president. The school was opened in 1808, in a house on Mulberry Street, across the street from the original St. Patrick's Cathedral. It remained there only briefly, before relocating to Broadway in September 1809; it moved again in March 1810 to a plot of land \\"far out in the country,\\" north of the New York City limits. This new site would eventually become the location of the new St. Patrick's Cathedral, in Midtown Manhattan. alt=Original St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City The school grew quickly, enrolling the sons of several prominent Catholic and Protestant families, and its curriculum emphasized the study of Latin, Ancient Greek, and French. However, the Jesuit superior in the United States, Giovanni Antonio Grassi, determined that there were not enough Jesuits in the United States could not sustain both Georgetown and the New York Literary Institution. Despite Kohlmann desiring to close Georgetown, Grassi sided with the bulk of Jesuits who were native to Maryland and ordered the New York school closed in 1813, with it officially shuttering in April 1814. Responsibility for the facility was transferred to the Trappist order. While in New York, Fenwick and Kohlmann were called for by the dying Thomas Paine, to his house in Greenwich Village. Having been unsuccessfully treated by several physicians, Paine sought to priests to heal him. They attempted to convince him to renounce a lifetime of writings denouncing Christianity, to which he angrily dismissed them from his house. Fenwick served alongside Kohlmann as pastor of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1809, an office he held until 1815. When Kohlmann was recalled to Maryland in 1815, Fenwick succeeded him as pastor of St. Peter's Church as well. He also replaced Kohlmann as the apostolic administrator of the Diocese of New York. He was successful in prompting hundreds of conversions to Catholicism throughout the diocese during his tenure. Fenwick was present at the formal dedication of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1816. He also drew up designs for the new St. Patrick's Cathedral, whose construction would be completed after he left New York. The Dominican priest, Charles Ffrench, succeeded Fenwick as pastor of St. Peter's, and John Power would become the next pastor of Old St. Peter's in 1825. Fenwick became vicar general of the diocese for Bishop John Connelly in 1816, in which post he remained until April 1817.  Georgetown College and South Carolina  Fenwick became the president of Georgetown College and the pastor of Holy Trinity Church on June 28, 1817, succeeding Giovanni Antonio Grassi at the former, and Francis Neale at the latter. The college's first degrees were conferred during his brief term. Later that year, Ambrose Mar√©chal, the Archbishop of Baltimore, sent Fenwick to Charleston, South Carolina, where there was a long-standing schism at a local Catholic church. He was replaced at Georgetown by Anthony Kohlmann, and at Holy Trinity by Theodore M. DeTheux. Fenwick arrived in Charleston in the fall of 1818 as vicar general of the Archdiocese of Baltimore for the city. His mission was to resolve the ecclesiastical dispute, where the lay trustees at the predominantly Irish St. Mary's Church refused to accept a French priest as their pastor, and defied the orders of Archbishop Leonard Neale to have their desired pastor move to another parish. With tensions long- standing, the French- and English-speaking parishioners refused to attend services said in the others' language. Fenwick resolved the dispute by preaching the sermons himself, in which he would alternate between French and English. As vicar, he traveled throughout the Carolinas to minister. Fenwick remained in Charleston one year beyond the erection of the new Diocese of Charleston and the appointment of John England as the first bishop. In May 1822, Fenwick returned to Washington, D.C. as the minister of Georgetown College and the procurator of the Jesuits in the United States. In September 1825, the Jesuit mission superior, Francis Dzierozynski, again made Fenwick acting president of the college and vice rector, as the incumbent president‚Äîhis brother, Enoch‚Äîrefused to return to the college after leaving for St. Thomas Manor. His term as acting president lasted less than a year, before he was replaced by Stephen Lariguadelle Dubuisson. Fenwick then briefly became the spiritual director of the Mount Carmel Monastery in Port Tobacco, Maryland.  Bishop of Boston  alt=Portrait of Benedict Fenwick as bishop Fenwick was appointed the second Bishop of Boston by Pope Leo XII on May 10, 1825, succeeding Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus. The papal bull notifying him of his appointment arrived in July 1825, and he embarked on an eight-day spiritual retreat. Upon its completion, Fenwick was consecrated a bishop in the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore on November 1. Archbishop Ambrose Mar√©chal served as principal consecrator, while Bishops John England and Henry Conwell were co-consecrators. Fenwick arrived in Boston on December 3, and formally took canonical possession of the Diocese of Boston at the original Cathedral of the Holy Cross, on December 21, 1825. Though the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the diocese encompassed all of New England, Bishop Fenwick had only two priests under his charge, who served three Catholic churches, besides the cathedral, in all of New England: Saint Augustine's Chapel in Boston, St. Patrick's Church in Newcastle, Maine, and a small church in Claremont, New Hampshire. Throughout New England, there were approximately 10,000 Catholics. Due to significant Irish immigration, the Catholic population in the diocese grew to at least 30,000 by 1833. Fenwick traveled throughout the large territory to manage the diocese and administer the sacrament of confirmation. This included visiting Penobscot and Passamaquoddy tribes in Maine, who were largely Catholic, and were the subject of intensive proselytism by Protestant evangelists. Fenwick ordered the construction of St. Anne's Church in Old Town, Maine for them in 1828, and sought to improve their schools. Fenwick addressed a shortage of priests in his diocese by sending prospective seminarians to Maryland and Canada to be educated, and by incarnating several priests from other dioceses. He also trained several students in a makeshift seminary at his episcopal residence. As a result, the number of priests in the diocese had increased to 24 by this time. Many new parishes were founded throughout New England. Fenwick attended the First Provincial Council of Baltimore convened in 1829. As in South Carolina, Fenwick was an ardent opponent of lay trusteeism in the Diocese of Boston. With a rapidly expanding Catholic population in the diocese, a portion of the territory was removed to form the Diocese of Hartford in 1843. That year, John Bernard Fitzpatrick was appointed as Fenwick's coadjutor bishop, and would later succeed him as Bishop of Boston. By the end of Fenwick's episcopate, the number of Catholics in the Diocese of Boston (after the removal of Hartford) had increased to 70,000, in addition to 37 priests, and 44 churches. In December 1845, Fenwick's health began to decline, due to an ailment of the heart. Eight months later, he died on August 11, 1846. After the funeral, his body was carried from the Cathedral of the Holy Cross to the train station, from where it was taken to the College of the Holy Cross and buried in the cemetery. Bishop Fenwick High School in Peabody, Massachusetts, which opened in 1959, was named in his honor. = Educational institutions = One of Fenwick's primary tasks was the creation of Catholic educational institutions in Boston. He established a Sunday school at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, where Fenwick himself catechized both children and their parents. This was followed by the establishment of a co-ed day school. The cathedral was eventually enlarged, which included the construction of two classrooms in the basement for use by these schools. Fenwick also invited the Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland to Boston to educate the immigrant children of the city in 1832. Three sisters arrived on May 2, 1832, and founded the first Catholic charitable institution in Massachusetts, which consisted of an orphanage, a school for poor girls, and a Sunday school. This institution would be incorporated in 1843 as St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum, and operated until 1949. alt=Fenwick Hall at the College of the Holy Cross By 1830, the establishment of a Catholic college and seminary became Fenwick's highest priority. In April of the following year, he purchased land adjacent to the Boston cathedral, where he planned to open a college, but the project stalled. He desired to have the school run by the Jesuits, but in 1835, they declined his invitation, and his plan for a college was placed on hold. In the spirit of the ongoing Restoration Movement in the United States, Fenwick purchased in Aroostook County, Maine, in 1835. The compound became known as Benedicta, and on it, lumber and grist mills as well as agriculture were begun. There, he sought to create a college in the wilderness, which would be part of a larger utopian Catholic community where Irish Catholics of Boston, who lived in squalor, could resettle. However, the Bostonians showed little interest in moving to Maine. Therefore, Fenwick instead decided to establish a college in Worcester, Massachusetts, on of land owned by the local priest, James Fitton. Fenwick purchased the land from Fitton in 1842, and chose as the name of the new school the College of the Holy Cross, in honor of the original Boston cathedral. This property was then supplemented, bringing its total to , and in 1843, Fenwick entrusted the new college to a party of Jesuits sent from Georgetown College. That year, construction of the college's first building began, which would later become known as Fenwick Hall. = Catholic media = Fenwick established several Catholic newspapers in the diocese. The first was The Catholic Press, which was founded in 1829 in Hartford, Connecticut, and survived for five years. Another was The Expostulator, which was established in 1830, and was written for young people; this paper survived for only two years. Fenwick's most enduring newspaper was The Jesuit, or Catholic Sentinel, which was founded in Boston in 1829. It later became known as The Pilot, which is today the oldest Catholic newspaper in the United States. He also assisted in editing the Catholic Laity's Directory, which was produced by John Power, the vicar general of New York, in 1822. Fenwick wrote a history of the Diocese of Boston from its founding to 1829, titled \\"Memoirs to Serve for the Future Ecclesiastical History of the Diocess of Boston.\\" However, this was never published during his lifetime. He also directed many historical Catholic books to be reprinted for the diocese. = Anti-Catholicism in New England = Charlestown after the riot of 1834alt=Ursuline convent ruins A convent of Ursuline nuns, which also conducted a free school for poor girls, was located next to the Boston cathedral. As their facilities were inadequate, Fenwick purchased a new property for the nuns in Charlestown, today located in East Somerville. The purchased was made on July 17, 1826, and the nuns erected a new convent and school there, completing their move in 1828. They named it the Convent and Academy of Mount Benedict, in honor of the bishop. As the nuns' vow of enclosure did not allow them to actively manage the construction of the new facilities, or their expansion in 1829, Fenwick oversaw much of the work. With the change in location came a change in mission; the school began charging tuition, and though it admitted some students for free, it sought to primarily educate the daughters of the elite Protestant residents of Charlestown. Nativism and anti-Catholicism were rampant in greater Boston at this time. Lurid rumors that Catholic convents were dens of immorality were prevalent; among these were allegations that convents imprisoned women against their wills, murdered babies, and concealed sexual deviance. While upper-class Protestants were willing to send their daughters to the Catholic academy, lower-class Protestants, particularly Congregationalists, were distrustful of the school. These tensions led to the Ursuline Convent riots. On August 10, 1834, posters were displayed in the neighborhood that declared unless the convent were investigated by the board of selectmen of Charlestown, it would be \\"demolished\\" by the \\"Truckmen of Boston.\\" The following day, authorities were sent to inspect the convent. As they left, a mob of 2,000, wearing masks or painted faces, encircled the convent, and threw bricks through the windows, stole precious objects from the interior, and then lit it ablaze; the nuns fled. The fire department, which largely shared the attitudes of the rioters, arrived but did not attempt to extinguish the fire. The convent's adjacent graveyard was attacked as well. All but one of the perpetrators was acquitted in a subsequent jury trial. The Massachusetts legislature refused to redress the destruction of the convent. Anti-Catholic sentiment in the city only increased after the convent riots, which caused the Ursuline nuns to flee to Canada. Tensions steadily grew until some feared the outbreak of a religious war. The Charlestown selectmen banned Catholics from being buried in the Catholic cemetery Fenwick established on Bunker Hill. An effigy of Bishop Fenwick was shot with guns in 1835, and threats were made on his life. Widespread violence and destruction occurred during the Broad Street Riot of 1837, and Irish Catholics took up arms as the Montgomery Guards. Another burning of a Catholic church occurred in 1838 in Burlington, Vermont. =Dispute at St. Mary's Church= alt=St. Mary's Church in the North End of Boston Fenwick's episcopate involved numerous conflicts both among parishioners over control of their respective churches, and between parishioners and the bishop. Some of these disputes turned violent, and involved calls for leaving the Catholic Church to create new churches. One such dispute arose at St. Mary's Church in the North End of Boston in 1840. That year, Patrick O'Beirne and Thomas J. O'Flaherty were appointed co-pastors of the predominantly Irish church. The parish quickly became polarized, with parishioners supporting either O'Flaherty, who advocated strong lay control of the church, or O'Beirne, who advocated episcopal control. Divisions were further deepened by O'Flaherty's support of the temperance movement and opposition to the Acts of Union 1800, which united Ireland and Great Britain. By 1842, the congregation was so divided that Fenwick worried violence might erupt. Therefore, he attempted to restore peace by personally visiting the church, threatening excommunication for disobedience of church authorities, banning mass protests, and ordering the two pastors to publicly reconcile. Eventually, Fenwick transferred O'Beirne to Providence, Rhode Island, at O'Beirne's request. None of these efforts were effective in restoring tranquility, and on February 20, 1842, O'Beirne's supporters began a riot during a Vespers service over which O'Flaherty presided. The perpetrators were arrested and prosecuted, and Fenwick placed the parish under interdict for two weeks. He then transferred O'Flaherty to Salem, Massachusetts, and removed O'Beirne from Providence. Though O'Flaherty's supporters demand his return, and organized regular train rides to visit him, the dispute at St. Mary's came to an end.

Their music draws heavily on folk and world music influences, especially Greek folk music. Background Burlap to Cashmere was formed in the winter of 1994 by cousins John Philippidis and Steven Delopoulos. The troupe was originally a college theater show that Steven Delopoulos put together for his final exam at Marymount Manhattan college, a theater and dance college which Delopoulos attended. He later asked his then 14-year-old cousin Johnny to join him in the show, and the band was formed. Members Mike Ernest (guitar) and childhood friend Theodore Pagano (drums) followed. In 1995 Jamison Ernest managed the band and arranged for them to play at The Bitter End on a regular basis. In 1998 Burlap to Cashmere signed with A&M; Records and released the full-length recording Anybody Out There? followed by an A&M; re-release of Live at the Bitter End, but the constant touring \\"caused Burlap to burn bright and then burn out.\\" In 2005, a new Burlap to Cashmere demo album was recorded.

It was capable of accomplishing a wide variety of missions, such as long- range maritime reconnaissance, coastal and supply line patrols, torpedo/bombing strikes, mine-laying, and transport operations. Design and development The Be-6 was a gull-winged aircraft with twin oval vertical stabilizers on top of a deep fuselage. The aircraft was of all-metal construction except for fabric covering the rudders and ailerons. The fuselage was divided into eight watertight compartments to improve survivability. The engines were installed in the bends of the wings, with the floats on an underwing cantilever rack. Each float was divided into four watertight compartments. Operational history A-4B intercepting a Be-6 off Japan, 1964. The Be-6 was built from 1949 to 1957 at the Beriev plant in Taganrog. The aircraft had 19 variants through its production cycle, and 123 aircraft were eventually built. Since requirements of Soviet naval aircraft did not change rapidly, the reliable Be-6 remained in service until the late 1960s. Some aircraft ended service as civilian unarmed transports in Arctic regions. One survivor is preserved at the Ukraine State Aviation Museum in Kiev, Ukraine. Beriev Be-6s operated by the People's Republic of China PLANAF proved useful in patrolling the long coastline and huge territorial waters off China's coast. During the 1970s the original Shvetsov radial engines began to wear out with no replacements available, so several aircraft were re-engined with WoJiang WJ-6 turboprop engines, in new nacelles, for a new lease of life and were redesignated Qing-6.Gordon,Yefim & Komissarov, Dmitry.

This colorless solid is soluble in organic solvents. It features a carboxylmethyl group (CH2CO2H) linked to the \\"1-position\\" of naphthalene. Use and regulation NAA is a synthetic plant hormone in the auxin family and is an ingredient in many commercial plant rooting horticultural products; it is a rooting agent and used for the vegetative propagation of plants from stem and leaf cuttings. It is also used for plant tissue culture. The hormone NAA does not occur naturally, and, like all auxins, is toxic to plants at high concentrations. In the United States, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), products containing NAA require registration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as pesticides. Use and analysis NAA is widely used in agriculture for various purposes. It is considered to be only slightly toxic but when at higher concentrations it can be toxic to animals. This was shown when tested on rats via oral ingestion at 1000‚Äì5900 mg/kg.Tomlin, C.D.S., 2006. The Pesticide Manual, 14th ed. UK NAA has been shown to greatly increase cellulose fiber formation in plants when paired with another phytohormone called gibberellic acid. Because it is in the auxin family it has also been understood to prevent premature dropping and thinning of fruits from stems. It is applied after blossom fertilization. Increased amounts can actually have negative effects however, and cause growth inhibition to the development of plant crops. It has been used on many different crops including apples, olives, oranges, potatoes, and various other hanging fruits.

The house and its private chapel were built in the early 18th century, replacing an earlier hall and chapel nearby. They were built to Neoclassical designs by William Smith and (probably) his son Francis. Later in the 18th century, the house was extended by the addition of an orangery and a drawing room. In the 1830s the house was remodelled by Edward Blore; the work included the addition of an extension and a frontage in Jacobean style, and joining the central block to the service wings. In about 1837 the orangery was replaced by a large conservatory designed by Joseph Paxton. In 1861 the main part of the house was virtually destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt by Anthony Salvin, who generally followed Blore's designs but made modifications to the front, rebuilt the back of the house in Jacobean style, and altered the interior. There were further alterations later in the 19th century, including remodelling of the Saloon. During the Second World War the hall was used by the Red Cross, but subsequent deterioration prompted a restoration. The hall is built in brick with ashlar dressings and slate roofs, and is a Grade II* listed building. It has a long entrance front consisting of a three-storey central block with lateral wings, each of which has two four-storey turrets. Outside this on each side are two-storey service blocks that project forward, forming a three-sided entrance forecourt. The ground-floor public rooms include a drawing room, a dining room, and a sculpture gallery. The bedrooms, dressing rooms and another gallery are on the first floor. The hall stands in grounds containing gardens and parkland that includes a lake. A particularly notable listed structure in the grounds is the Grade II* listed private chapel, also designed by William Smith, that is contemporaneous with the hall, together with its elaborate Grade II listed gates and gate piers. The bridge over the lake, an icehouse and a lodge are also listed. The earthworks of the previous hall and chapel and a deserted medieval village in the grounds are together designated as a scheduled ancient monument. Today the hall, chapel and grounds are privately owned by the Bromley-Davenport family. They are open to the public at advertised times, and are used for special events. They are also available to be hired for purposes such as weddings and corporate events. History The manor of Capesthorne was held by the Capesthorne family until 1386, when it passed to the Ward family. The house previously on the site was to the west, with a chapel to its north, its site being marked by a brick column in the grounds. In 1719 John Ward engaged William Smith to design a new house and chapel on a different site. The first parts of the new house to be built were two lateral detached wings, one for domestic offices, and the other for stables and a coach house. The main block of the house followed later. William Smith died in 1724 and it is thought that the main block was designed by his younger brother, Francis Smith. The house was in Neoclassical style, with a front of seven bays, the middle three bays breaking forward under a pediment, and was built in brick with stone dressings. The house was two rooms deep, with a central entrance hall, and a corridor leading from each side. Painting of the garden front of the hall by Edward Blore in about 1827 John Ward died in 1748 and as he had no male heir the manor passed to the Davenport family by the marriage of his daughter Penelope to Davies Davenport. Davies Davenport's grandson (also called Davies Davenport) improved and extended the house, with the addition of a single-storey orangery to the southwest, and a drawing room to the northwest. When he died, his son, Edward Davies Davenport commissioned Edward Blore to remodel the house. Between 1837 and 1839 Blore joined the lateral wings to the main part of the house by adding new rooms at the sides. He also widened the wings, and built new stables and service courts to the north and south, creating a symmetrical structure. The main part of the house was recessed and, together with the wings, a large forecourt was created. The front of the house itself was refronted in Jacobean style. Mullioned windows replaced sash windows, and a ground floor loggia, and turrets with ogee caps and shaped gables were added. In the centre of the house was a raised attic with a clock and a bellcote. The rest of the building retained its Neoclassical features. The orangery was replaced with a large conservatory designed by Joseph Paxton, and this led directly to the family pew in the chapel. Blore also designed entrance lodges. In 1861, when the house was owned by Edward's son Arthur Henry Davenport, most of the central part of the house was destroyed by fire, leaving only the wings, the loggia, and part of the front wall. Blore had by then retired and Anthony Salvin was commissioned to rebuild the house. He kept generally to Blore's plans, but gave the entrance front three shaped gables rather than the central attic. At the rear of the house the garden front was rebuilt in Jacobean rather than Neoclassical style. Internally, Salvin changed the proportions of the storeys, making the ground floor ceilings higher. Arthur Henry Davenport died in 1867 before the rebuilding had been completed, and the house passed to William Bromley-Davenport. During his ownership the saloon was remodelled in 1879 as was the chapel in 1884. In the Second World War the house was used by the Red Cross. By this time the fabric of the house had deteriorated, but it has since been restored. The house continues to be owned by the Bromley-Davenport family. Architecture =Exterior= Garden front Capesthorne Hall is constructed in red brick with ashlar dressings and has a slate roof. Its plan is symmetrical and consists of a central block in three storeys with cellars, and two-storey lateral blocks protruding forward to form three sides of a forecourt. The middle part of the central block is in seven bays, with a colonnade consisting of segmental arches. These are carried on Tuscan columns with circular panels in the spandrels, and keystones decorated with diamond rustication. Behind this are seven mullioned and transomed windows, and there are similar windows in the middle storey. Above these is a cornice and three shaped gables containing mullioned windows. The gables have stone copings and finials, and contain heraldic panels. Flanking the middle part of the central block are three-storey slightly projecting wings. They have one central bay and lateral four-storey turrets. The central bays contain two-storey canted bay windows, above which are pierced stone parapets, three-light mullioned windows, and shaped gables with pierced ogee finials. The turrets have bands between the stages, single-light windows and ogee caps with finials. Projecting forward on each side of the central block are two-storey service blocks. The fa√ßades facing the forecourt are similar, with semicircular arches in front of them, that on the left side being blocked, and the arch on the right side forming a porte-coch√®re. Behind the arches are seven-bay fronts, the central bay projecting slightly and containing a door with a fanlight. Above this is an oriel window on consoles over which is a shaped gable. The other windows in both storeys are sashes. The outward facing fronts are similar to the forecourt fronts, except that the end and centre bays protrude and are gabled. Between the gables are balustraded parapets. =Interior= In rebuilding the interior of the house after the fire of 1861, Salvin followed Blore's design in some of the rooms, and in others he used his own designs. The Entrance Hall very much follows Blore's design. It has a panelled ceiling with pendants, and the windows contain 19th-century stained glass arranged by Willement, featuring the arms of the Davenport and Ward families. The chimney piece was added by Salvin, and contains the figures of a caryatid and an Atlas that were formerly part of the reading desk of the two-decker pulpit in the chapel. The Sculpture Gallery, also by Blore, also has a panelled ceiling, and consists of a corridor along the sides of which are arched niches. Most of the sculptures in the gallery were collected by Edward Davies Davenport, and consist of ancient copies of famous Greek sculptures. There is also the face of Charles James Fox by Joseph Nollekens, and a pair of Dancing Girls by Antonio Canova. The Saloon is by Salvin, and again has a panelled ceiling. The room features a large fireplace with an overmantel in the early Renaissance style, numerous family portraits, and vases collected on the overseas trips. The Drawing Room, designed by Salvin, is on the garden front, and features a panelled ceiling with pendants, and a floral frieze. In the room are twin fireplaces made from Coade stone, dated to 1789, which originally belonged to the family's house in Belgravia, London. Both are carved, one depicting Faith, Hope and Charity, and the other the Aldobrandini Marriage. Entrance Hall in 1840 The State Dining Room is very much as Blore designed it, and has a panelled ceiling with pendants, and wooden panelling up to the line of the dado. The room contains a large fireplace in early Renaissance style, made from white and variegated marble, and containing the family arms. Also in the room are sculptures by Joseph Wilton. The Staircase Hall is by Salvin, and is divided from the Sculpture Gallery by three semicircular archways. On the walls are portraits of the Bromley family. The staircase has a wrought iron balustrade decorated with acanthus and roundels with the crests of the Bromleys and the Davenports. The Davenport crest consists of a felon with a rope around his neck; in these roundels the felon has the face of William Gladstone, a political opponent of the Davenports. There are four further ground floor rooms, all by Salvin. The Library has a panelled ceiling with diamond motifs. It contains imitation Jacobean panelling and a Jacobean fireplace from the now-demolished Marton Hall. The Study also has a panelled ceiling, and in this case includes a circular central motif. The Private Dining Room contains a 19th-century marble fireplace, and the Ground Floor Bedroom has a coffered ceiling and a Victorian-baroque fireplace. The first floor landing has archways similar to those on the ground floor. Leading from this is the Upper Gallery, which contains documents relating to the genealogy of the Bromley-Davenports. Beyond this is the Dorothy Davenport Room and its dressing room. The room gets its name from Dorothy Davenport (1562‚Äì1639). She spent 26 years in creating the needlework that is mounted on the Jacobean bed in the room. The work includes the dates of its progress, and depicts, among other subjects, the Garden of Eden and Man's Fall from Paradise. The other rooms on the first floor include the State Bedroom, which contains valuable items of furniture, such as a commode by Boulle, and a pair of encoignures, the State Dressing Room, the American Room, which is decorated with items from Philadelphia, and the Yellow Room, which was the bedroom of Sir William Bromley-Davenport who died in 1949. In the passage outside the American Room is a portrait of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau by Allan Ramsay. Grounds The hall is surrounded by a landscaped park that includes woodland, parkland, lawns, lakes with a boat house, and an arboretum containing 18th-century maple trees. In the grounds are a number of structures of notability and interest. =Chapel and chapel gates= Summer house constructed from the chapel's original bell turret The chapel was designed by William Smith, and was remodelled in 1887. It is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The chapel is built in brick on a stone plinth with stone dressings and a slate roof, and consists of a three-bay nave and an apsidal chancel, with a bell turret. The doorway and the windows are round-headed, and around the top of the chapel is a cornice and a balustrade with square piers capped by swagged ball finials. Inside the chapel the original box pews were replaced by facing pews in college style. At the west end is a raised family pew. On the walls are terracotta panels by George Tinworth. The reredos is in mosaic with an alabaster surround, it was made by Salviati and is loosely based on Giotto's Dormition. To the southwest of the chapel are gates and gate piers. The gate piers date from the 20th century, and the gates from about 1750. The piers are in brick on stone plinths and have stepped stone caps with ball finials. The gates are in wrought iron and were made in Milan. They are wide with arched centres and contain Rococo panels depicting Saint Andrew with his cross. =Other structures= North lodge The bridge crossing the lake dates from about 1843, and is constructed in brick with stone dressings. It consists of five segmental arches, with abutments running down to the banks. The arches have rusticated voussoirs and keystones, and above the voussoirs are hood moulds. Between the arches are brick pilasters. Along the top of the bridge is a stone balustrade with square piers. Also in the grounds is an icehouse dating from the 18th or early 19th century. It is built in brick and consists of a circular domed chamber. From the arched entrance a barrel vaulted passage leads through a rectangular opening into the chamber. Also in the grounds is a summer house that was formerly the bell turret of the chapel. It carries a gold flag with the date 1722. The lodge at the north entrance to the grounds was designed by Blore and dates from about 1843. It is built in brick with ashlar dressings and has a felt roof. The lodge consists of a three-storey square tower containing two-light mullioned windows. At the top of the tower is an entablature with a panelled parapet and pierced ogee finials on the corners. The roof is ogee-shaped with a ball finial and a flagpole. Lake with the bridge =Earthworks= Although the earlier hall and chapel have long been demolished, earthworks remaining from them are still present, as are those of a nearby deserted medieval village. The platform for the chapel, which measures about by , is still present. There are extensive earthworks on the site of the hall. To the east of these are the platforms and enclosures of about seven medieval houses, and associated with these is evidence of a medieval field system. All these earthworks are designated together as a scheduled ancient monument. Appraisal The hall, together with the wall surrounding the entrance court, and the chapel are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II* listed buildings. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades of listed buildings and is applied to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". The gate and gate piers associated with the chapel are listed at Grade II, as are the bridge crossing the lake, the ice house, and the north lodge. Grade II is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". De Figueiredo and Treuherz note that when Salvin restored the two wings that each contain two turrets on the front of the hall, he left their tops open on two sides, so that they appear solid from the front but not from the back. Hartwell et al in the Buildings of England series, commenting on the appearance of the hall, say \\"but it is all front\\". They note \\"the thinness of the end parts and the hollowness of the sham towers\\" and state that the \\"back is without drama\\", and conclude that \\"it is a grand concept executed lamely\\". Present day Capesthorne Hall is a member of the Historic Houses Association, and the hall, chapel and gardens are open to the general public on advertised times between March and October, for which there is an admission charge, and refreshments are available for visitors. The hall and gardens are available to hire for weddings and for corporate events. A programme of events is organised in the hall and in the grounds, where there is a caravan park.

Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia, then often referred to by the anglicized name Theodore, imprisoned several missionaries and two representatives of the British government in an attempt to force the British government to comply with his requests for military assistance. The punitive expedition launched by the British in response required the transportation of a sizable military force hundreds of miles across mountainous terrain lacking any road system. The formidable obstacles to the action were overcome by the commander of the expedition, General Sir Robert Napier, who was victorious in every battle against the troops of Tewodros, captured the Ethiopian capital, and rescued all the hostages. The expedition was widely hailed on its return for achieving all its objectives. Harold G. Marcus described the action as \\"one of the most expensive affairs of honour in history.\\"  Background  The expedition route through Abyssinia By October 1862 Emperor Tewodros's position as ruler had become precarious: much of Ethiopia was in revolt against him, except for a small area stretching from Lake Tana east to his fortress at Magdala. He was engaged in constant military campaigns against a wide array of rebels. Likewise, Abyssinia was also threatened by the encroachment of Islam: Ottoman Turks and Egyptians repeatedly invaded Ethiopia from the Red Sea and from Sudan, while the Muslim Oromo tribe was expanding throughout Central Ethiopia. In a final attempt to recover his standing, Tewodros wrote to the major powers for help. As Donald Crummey recounts, \\"Now came the definitive attempt, at the turning point of the Emperor's career. Success might stabilize the internal situation; defeat would pull out the last prop. He proposed to send embassies with the ultimate objective of obtaining military alliances and agreements for technical progress.\\" Tewodros sent letters to the Russian Empire, Prussia, the Austrian Empire, French Empire and the British Empire. The French government responded with demands on behalf of a Lazarist mission in Hamasien, at the edge of Tewodros's realm; they were the only country known to have responded. A former diplomat points out more was involved than simple indifference: The letter was in Amharic and was sent to Germany for translation. Tewodros's letter to Queen Victoria appealed to Christian solidarity in the face of the Islamic expansion occurring throughout the region but this garnered little sympathy. The British Empire's interests in Northeast Africa were not geared towards a Christian \\"crusade\\" against Islam but instead, the British sought to cooperate politically, strategically and commercially with the Ottoman Empire, Egypt and the Sudan. This was not only to protect the route to India but also to ensure that the Ottoman Empire continued to act as a buffer against Russia's plans for expansion into Central Asia. Moreover, as a result of the American Civil War, deliveries of cotton from the Confederate States of America to the British textile industry were declining, making the British increasingly dependent on Egyptian-Sudanese cotton. In the view of these interests, the British Foreign Office did not look favorably on supporting Tewodros. The letter was preserved but not answered.  Hostages  The first European to cross Tewodros' path after this lack of a response happened to be Henry Stern, a British missionary. Stern had also mentioned the Emperor's humble origins in a book he had published; although the reference was not intended to be insulting (\\"the eventful and romantic history of the man, who, from a poor boy, in a reed-built convent became...the conqueror of numerous provinces, and the Sovereign of a great and extensive realm\\") it proved to be a dangerous mistake. At the time Tewodros was insisting on the truth of his descent from the Solomonic dynasty, and Tewodros expressed his rage in many ways, including having Stern's servants beaten to death, and Stern, together with his assistant, a Mr Rosenthal, were \\"chained, severely treated, and the latter thrashed on several occasions.\\" The British consul Charles Duncan Cameron, along with the Abuna Salama III and the group of missionaries based at Gafat, all interceded for the release of the imprisoned pair, and for a while it appeared that their efforts might succeed; but on 2 January 1864 Cameron was seized along with his staff, and all were put in chains. Shortly afterwards, Tewodros ordered most of the Europeans in the royal camp put into chains. The British government sent Hormuzd Rassam, an ethnic Assyrian Christian from Mesopotamia, to negotiate a solution to this crisis, but \\"security in Tigre, the King's indecisiveness, and continuing confusion about the envoy's instructions\\" delayed Rassam's arrival at Tewodros's camp until January 1866. At first, it looked as if Rassam might succeed in the release of the hostages: the Emperor showed him great favour, establishing him at Qorata, a village on the south-eastern shores of Lake Tana, and sending him numerous gifts, and having Cameron, Stern, and the other hostages sent to his encampment. Tewodros' captives However, about this time C.T. Beke arrived at Massawa, and forwarded letters from the hostages' families to Tewodros asking for their release. At the least Beke's actions only made Tewodros suspicious. Rassam, writing in his memoirs of the incident, is more direct: \\"I date the change in the King's conduct towards me, and the misfortunes which eventually befell the members of the Mission and the old captives, from this day.\\" Meanwhile, Emperor Tewodros's behaviour was becoming increasingly erratic, his actions included acts of friendship towards Rassam, paranoid accusations, and sudden violence upon whoever happened to be around him. In the end, Rassam himself was made a prisoner, and one of the missionaries dispatched with the news and Tewodros's latest demands in June 1866. The Emperor eventually moved all of his European prisoners to his fortress on Magdala, and continued to parley with the British until Queen Victoria announced the decision to send a military expedition to rescue the hostages 21 August 1867.  The campaign  = Planning = British naval and support ships in the Gulf of Zula, December 1867 In the eyes of Alan Moorehead, \\"There has never been in modern times a colonial campaign quite like the British expedition to Ethiopia in 1868. It proceeds from first to last with the decorum and heavy inevitability of a Victorian state banquet, complete with ponderous speeches at the end. And yet it was a fearsome undertaking; for hundreds of years the country had never been invaded, and the savage nature of the terrain alone was enough to promote failure.\\" The task was given to the Bombay Army, and command of the expeditionary force to Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier. This was a very unusual decision as it was the first time a campaign had been entrusted to an officer from the Corps of Royal Engineers, it was also a very sensible decision, as the whole campaign would rely on engineering skills to succeed. Intelligence was carefully gathered about Ethiopia while the size of the army was calculated and its needs estimated before a massive effort begun to meet them. \\"Thus, for example, forty-four trained elephants were to be sent from India to carry the heavy guns on the march, while hiring commissions were dispatched all over the Mediterranean and the Near East to obtain mules and camels to handle the lighter gear. A railway, complete with locomotives and some twenty miles (32 km) of track, was to be laid across the coastal plain, and at the landing place large piers, lighthouses and warehouses were to be built.\\" Given the long supply lines and limited resources of their own, the British understood that they were extremely dependent on a constant and reliable local supply of food for the men and forage for the animals. Accordingly, they decided to not plunder along the route but instead to pay for all needed supplies. To this end, the expedition took with them a sizable sum of the most commonly used currency in 19th century Ethiopia, the Maria Theresa Thaler. The Baloch Regiment in camp The Naval Brigade The force consisted of 13,000 British and Indian soldiers, 26,000 camp followers and over 40,000 animals, including the elephants. In addition, there was a sizable contingent of embedded journalists, including the journalist Henry Morton Stanley as well as several European observers, translators, artists and photographers. The force set sail from Bombay in upwards of 280 steam and sailing ships. The advance guard of engineers landed at Zula on the Red Sea, about south of Massawa, and began to construct a port in mid-October 1867. By the end of the first month they had completed a pier, long; they completed a second one by the first week of December. The railway was already reaching into the interior, with eight iron girder bridges built. At the same time an advance guard, under Sir William Lockyer Merewether, had pushed up the dry bed of the Kumayli River to the Suru Pass, where again the engineers were busy at work building a road to Senafe long, rising to for the elephants, gun- carriages, and carts. The demand for water was enormous; the Zula camp using 200 tons a day, which was created using condensation from steamship boilers in the harbour. As the force moved inland, wells had to be dug. From Senafe, Merewether sent out two letters from Lieutenant-General Napier: one to Emperor Tewodros, demanding the release of the hostages (which Rassam intercepted and destroyed, afraid this ultimatum might enrage Tewodros against the prisoners); the other to the people of Ethiopia, proclaiming that he was there purely to free the captives and that he had hostile intentions only towards those who sought to oppose him. Napier arrived at Zula on 2 January 1868, and put the finishing touches on his plan of advance before leaving on 25 January for Senafe. = Advance = It took the British forces three months to trek over of mountainous terrain to the foot of the Emperor's fortress at Magdala. At Antalo, Napier parleyed with Dajamach Kassai (later Emperor Yohannes IV), and won his support, which the British needed in their single-minded march to Magdala; without the help, or at least indifference, of the local peoples, the British Expedition would have had greater difficulty in reaching its goal deep within the Ethiopian highlands. On 17 March, the army reached Lake Ashangi, from their goal, and here, to further lighten their loads, the troops were put on half-rations. At this point, Emperor Tewodros's strength had already been dissolving. At the beginning of 1865 he controlled little more than Begemder, Wadla, and Delanta (wherein the fortress of Magdala lay). He struggled to keep up the size of his army‚Äîwhich Sven Rubenson points out was his only \\"instrument of power\\"‚Äîbut by mid-1867 defections from his army had reduced its size to 10,000 men. Harold Marcus observes, \\"For a total cost of about ¬£9,000,000 Napier set out to defeat a man who could muster only a few thousand troops and had long ago ceased to be Ethiopia's leader in anything but title.\\" The British were also aided by their diplomatic and political agreements with the native population, local potentates, and important provincial princes to protect the march from the coast to Magdala and to provide a reliable supply of food and forage. Additionally, Napier's pronouncement to the Governors, the Chiefs, the Religious Orders and the People of Abyssinia read: :It is known to you that Theodorus, King of Abyssinia, detains in captivity the British Council Cameron, the British Envoy Rassam and many others, in violation of the laws of all civilized nations. All friendly persuasion having failed to obtain their release, my Sovereign has commanded me to lead an Army to liberate them. All who befriend the prisoners or assist in their liberation shall be well rewarded, but those who may injure them shall be severely punished. When the time shall arrive for the march of a British Army through your country, bear in mind, People of Abyssinia, that the Queen of England has no unfriendly feelings towards you, and no design against your country or your Liberty. :Your religious establishments, your persons and your property shall be carefully protected. :All supplies required for my soldiers shall be paid for. No peaceable inhabitant shall be molested. The sole object for which the British Force has been sent to Abyssinia is the liberation of Her Majesty's subjects. There is no intention to occupy permanently any portion of the Abyssinian Territory, or to interfere with the government of the country. The two most powerful Ethiopian princes in the north, Dajamach Kassai of Tigray and Wagshum Gobeze of Lasta both pledged to cooperate and aid the British Army, thus transforming an apparent invasion of Abyssinia into a conquest of a single mountain fortress defended by only a few thousand warriors in the employ of an unpopular ruler. Additionally, the British secured the support of two Oromo Queens, Werkait and Mostiat, to block all escape routes from Magdala. British troops posing at a captured sentry post above Koket-Bir gate at Magdala fortress The fortress of Magdala burning = Tewodros' Movements = At the same time the British marched south to Magdala, Tewodros advanced from the west, up the course of the Bashilo River, with the cannons (including his prize creation, the massive Sebastopol) that he had induced the European missionaries and foreign artisans to build for him at Gafat. The Emperor intended to arrive at Magdala before the British, and although he had a shorter distance to cross and had started his journey ten days before Napier left Zula, his success was not certain, and he only arrived at his fortress ten days before his opponents. Rubenson notes that it was Tewodros, not the British expedition, which had to travel through hostile territory, for Tewodros's soldiers had marched under the threat of attacks from Gobeze's numerically superior forces, and had been obliged to defend themselves against a hostile peasantry. Tewodros's problems of provisioning for his army and transporting his artillery had also been much greater than Napier's. Most important of all, Tewodros could not trust even the four thousand soldiers who still followed him. Given the opportunity, they might abandon him as so many had already done. Tewodros provided one last demonstration of his lack of diplomatic skills on 17 February, when after accepting the submission of the inhabitants of Delanta, he asked them why they had waited until he appeared with his army. When they answered that they had been prevented by rebellious Oromo and Gobeze, \\"he told them they were as bad as the others, and ordered them to be plundered. ... Consequently, when the King [Tewodros] further ordered them to be attacked, they all fought bravely, and, in conjunction with the inhabitants of Dawunt, killed a great number of his soldiers and seized their arms and mules.\\" Not only had Tewodros isolated himself for several days in a hostile territory within sight of his last stronghold, a deputation from the Yejju, who were coming to him to offer their submission, upon hearing Tewodros's savagery promptly turned around. = Arrival of the British = On 9 April, the lead elements of the British force reached the Bashilo, \\"and on the following morning, Good Friday, they crossed the stream barefooted, stooping to fill their water-bottles on the way.\\" On the afternoon of that Good Friday, the decisive Battle of Magdala began outside the fortress. The British had to get past the plateau at Arogye, which lay across the only open route to Magdala. The way was barred by thousands of armed Ethiopian soldiers camped around the hillsides with up to 30 artillery pieces. The British, not expecting the Ethiopians to leave their defenses and attack them, paid little attention to them as they formed up to deploy. Tewodros, however, ordered an attack, and thousands of soldiers, many of them armed only with spears, charged the British positions. The British quickly deployed to meet the charging mass, and poured devastating fire into their ranks, including rockets from the Naval Brigade and Mountain gun artillery fire, as well as rifle fire. Of the rocket fire, Captain Hozier remarked \\"Many a charred mass and mangled heap showed how terrible was the havoc, how awful the death\\". During the fighting, an advance guard unit overpowered some of the Ethiopian artillery crews and captured their artillery pieces. After a 90-minute chaotic battle, the defeated Ethiopians retreated back to Magdala. Altogether, about 700 to 800 Ethiopian warriors were killed and 1,200 to 1,500 wounded, most of them seriously, while on the British side there were only twenty casualties, two fatally wounded men, nine seriously wounded, and nine lightly wounded. As such, the Arogye battle was far more bloody and consequential than the subsequent day's siege of the hill-top fort at Magdala. = Siege of Magdala = After repelling the Ethiopian attack, the British force moved onto Magdala the following day. As the British approached, Tewodros released two hostages on parole to offer terms. Napier insisted on release of the hostages and an unconditional surrender. Tewodros refused to unconditionally surrender, but released the European hostages over the next two days, while the native hostages had their hands and feet amputated before being thrown over the edge of the precipice surrounding the plateau. The British continued their advance on 13 April, and laid siege to the fortress of Magdala. The British attack began with a bombardment with mortars, rockets, and artillery. Infantry units then opened fire to provide cover for the Royal Engineers as they blew up the gates of the fortress at 4pm. British infantry then poured in and opened fire, and advanced with fixed bayonets, forcing the defenders to retreat to the second gate. The British then advanced and took the second gate, where they found Tewodros dead inside. Tewodros had committed suicide with a pistol that had originally been a gift from Queen Victoria, rather than face captivity. A modern commentator has tried to put a positive gloss on this event by stating \\"When Tewodros preferred self-inflicted death to captivity, he deprived the British of this ultimate satisfaction and laid the foundation for his own resurrection as a symbol of the defiant independence of the Ethiopian.\\" In fact, when Tewodros's death was announced, the defenders ceased all resistance. Lieutenant Stumm, an eyewitness, described the discovery of Tewodros's body: \\"Climbing a narrow rock stairway, we advanced quickly toward a second gate, through which we passed without meeting resistance. About a hundred paces beyond it lay the half-naked body of the Emperor himself, who had taken his own life with a pistol shot. A strange smile was on the remarkably young and attractive-looking face, and I was struck particularly by the finely drawn, boldly aquiline nose\\". Tewodros's body was cremated and his ashes buried inside a local church by the priests. The church itself was guarded by soldiers of the 33rd Regiment, who looted it, taking away a variety of gold, silver, and brass crosses, as well as filigree works and rare tabots. The casualties in the Battle for Magdala were comparatively small: the British artillery's bombardment killed about twenty Ethiopian warriors and civilians and wounded about 120, whereas a further forty-five Ethiopians were killed by rifle fire during the infantry assault. Altogether, the British troops' casualties included only ten seriously wounded and five lightly wounded. These deaths are noticeably fewer than the previous day's massacre at Arogye which proved to be the decisive engagement of the campaign. Before the British abandoned Magdala, Sir Robert ordered the destruction of Tewodros's artillery. He also permitted his troops to loot and burn the fortress, including its churches, as a punitive measure. The troops collected many historical and religious artefacts that were taken back to Britain, many of which can now be seen in the British LibraryBritish Library Website and the British Museum. Fifteen elephants and almost 200 mules were required to carry away the booty. Aftermath The British troops begin their return march to Zula Magdala was in the territory of the Muslim Oromo tribes, who had long before taken it from the Amhara people; however Tewodros had won it back from them some years earlier. Two rival Oromo queens, Werkait and Mostiat, had both allied themselves with the British and claimed control of the conquered fortress as a reward. Napier much preferred to hand Magdala over to the Christian ruler of Lasta, Wagshum Gobeze, because if Gobeze were in control of the fortress, he would be able to halt the Oromos' advance and assume responsibility for over 30,000 Christian refugees from Tewodros's camp. Yet as Gobeze was unresponsive to these overtures, much preferring to acquire Tewodros's cannons, and the two Oromo queens could not reach an arrangement, Napier decided to destroy the fortress. Following the destruction of Magdala, the British began to retrace their steps back to Zula, \\"an imposing procession, with the bands playing and the flags leading the way, but the army soon learned that they had earned no gratitude in Ethiopia; they were treated as simply another warlike tribe on the move, and now that they were going away like weak and defeated men they were an obvious target for attack.\\" At Senafe, the British rewarded Ras Kassai, Yohannes IV, for his services with a formidable quantity of supplies, which Marcus estimates were worth \\"approximately ¬£500,000\\": six mortars, six howitzers, about 900 muskets and rifles, stocks of ammunition which included 585,480 percussion caps, and other goods and supplies. These later aided his rise to Emperor against such talented rivals as Wagshum Gobeze and Menelik of Shewa. At Zula, Napier assigned Captain Charles Goodfellow, on behalf of the British Museum, to carry out an excavation in nearby Adulis, the harbour of the ancient Kingdom of Aksum. Several artifacts were uncovered including pottery, coins and stone columns. This marked the first archaeological excavation of the ancient city of Adulis, a key African port of antiquity which served as a hub for trade along the Red Sea. By 2 June, the base camp was dismantled and as the men and hostages were loaded into the ships, Napier boarded the Feroze on 10 June, and set sail for England by way of the Suez Canal. On a curious side note, many of the hostages were unhappy with Napier's demand that they leave the country. Several hostages argued that they had long since become alienated from their old homeland in Europe and would no longer have any chance of building a new life for their families there. The German observer Josef Bechtinger, who accompanied the expedition, wrote: \\"Most of them, instead of thanking Providence for their final rescue - were not all happy with the new turn of events. They were indignant, upset, at having to leave Abyssinia. \\"What\\" they said, \\"are we supposed to do in Europe now, what are we supposed to do now with our wives and children back in our homeland - which has become alien to us? How are we supposed to live now among people who have [become] alien to us and whom we no longer like? What are we supposed to live on?\\" Bechtinger reported that many of them eventually returned to their adopted country from Suez by way of Massawa. In London, Napier was made Baron Napier of Magdala in recognition of his achievement. General Napier was also made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 27 April 1868. At Gibraltar, where he served as governor from 1876 to 1883, there is a battery named in his honour, Napier of Magdala Battery. One soldier from the Expedition, John Kirkham, stayed in Ethiopia and ultimately served as an advisor to Yohannes IV. Kirkham was instrumental in training Ethiopian troops to Western military standards, raising and drilling what became known as the Emperor's Disciplined Force. Kirkham's troops played a major role in the defeat of Yohannes's rival for the Ethiopian crown, Wagshum Gobeze, fighting with conspicuous success in the Battle of Assam on 11 July 1871. Kirkham had sacrificed the right to British protection by taking service with Yohannes, something which came back to haunt him when he was imprisoned in Massawa by Egyptian forces during the Egyptian-Ethiopian War. Despite being discovered by a group of British sailors from HMS Teazer, the sailors were not permitted to help him escape. Kirkham died in captivity in 1876. = Ethiopian Politics = Tewodros had asked his wife, the Empress Tiruwork Wube, in the event of his death, to put his son, Prince Alemayehu, under the protection of the English. This decision was apparently made in fear that his life would be taken by any aspirant for the empire of Abyssinia. In accordance with these wishes, Alemayehu was taken to London where he was presented to Queen Victoria, who took a liking to the young boy. Alemayehu later studied at Cheltenham College, the Rugby School and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. However, both the Queen and Napier were later concerned with the subsequent development of the young prince who became increasingly lonely, unhappy and depressed during this time. In 1879, the prince died of illness at the age of 19. He was buried near the royal chapel in Windsor with a funeral plaque placed to his memory by Queen Victoria. After the withdrawal of the English, fighting for the succession to Tewodros's throne raged in Ethiopia from 1868 to 1872. Eventually, it was Dajamach Kassai of Tigray, not least because of the British weapons given to him by the withdrawing Magdala expedition, who was able to expand his power and prevail over his rivals. In July 1871, he won the Battle of Assam, near Adwa, even though he had far fewer troops defeated his old rival Wagshum Gobeze of Lasta. Kassai had himself crowned Emperor of Ethiopia, taking the name Yohannes IV. = Battle honour = The success of the expedition led to the institution of a battle honour, Abyssinia, which was awarded to units of the British Indian Army that had participated in the campaign. The units that participated from the campaign belonged, with the exception of the Madras Sappers, to the Bengal and Bombay Presidency armies. Stolen Antiquities After the Magdala expeditions ended, many stolen objects, cultural artifacts and art objects found their way into state and private collections, family possessions, and the hands of ordinary soldiers. Most of the books and manuscripts went to the British Museum or the Bodleian Library in Oxford, while a few went to the Royal Library in Windsor Castle and to smaller British collections. Other stolen objects ended up in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Museum of Mankind and the National Army Museum. The British National Army museum agreed to return a lock of Tewodros' hair. All the scientific acquisitions and expropriated articles of the Magdala expedition stimulated and promoted an increased interest in the history and culture of Ethiopian among European researchers and the educated public. This laid the foundations for modern Ethiopian Studies, and also for the research on the ancient Kingdom of Aksum. From time to time some of the looted treasure has been returned to Ethiopia. For instance, an edition of the Kebra Nagast along with an icon of a picture of Christ wearing the crown of thrones were returned to Emperor Yohannes IV in the 1870s. In 1902, Lady Valerie Meux bequeathed her collection of Ethiopian manuscripts to Emperor Menelik II, but her will was overturned shortly after her death in 1910. In 1924, the Empress Zawditu was given one of the two stolen crowns of Tewodros but the more valuable gold crown was retained by the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the 1960s, Queen Elizabeth II returned Tewodros's royal cap and seal to Emperor Haile Selassie while on a state visit to Ethiopia. In 1999, several prominent figures in England and Ethiopia created the Association For the Return of the Magdala Ethiopian Treasures (AFROMET) which has pursued an information and lobbying campaign to see all treasure repatriated back to Ethiopia.  In popular culture  The Abyssinia Expedition is the setting for the George MacDonald Fraser novel Flashman on the March.

Initially, it was a secondary education institution which included two main sections, the Institute of Vocal Music and the School of Instrumental Music, with branches in Bucharest and Ia≈üi, Moldavia's former capital.Short History of UNMB, at the UNMB official site; retrieved February 21, 2008 The Bucharest branch replaced the Philharmonic School (≈ûcoala FilarmonicƒÉ), which also offered lessons in acting. Scurt istoric , at the UNATC official site; retrieved February 21, 2008 The institution's first director was composer Alexandru Flechtenmacher, under whose leadership the Conservatory gave courses in violin, solfege, Christian music choir, piano, harmony, and singing. In 1900, composer Alfons Castaldi set up the first chamber music course. During the interwar period, the Conservatory grew to accommodate counterpoint, orchestration, aesthetics and music history classes. On July 17, 1931, it was turned into an academy placed under the patronage of King Carol II, and renamed Royal Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Academia RegalƒÉ de MuzicƒÉ ≈üi ArtƒÉ DramaticƒÉ). This was largely due to the efforts of one of Romania's most celebrated composers, George Enescu, who was later named Honorary Professor. In the 1940s, the Academy was led by Mihail Jora, whom the institution itself credits with having revolutionized teaching methods by imposing more rigor and innovative approaches. In the 1950s, under the communist regime, the Academy took the name of composer Ciprian Porumbescu, and reverted to the name of Conservatory --the Ciprian Porumbescu Conservatory or Conservatorul Ciprian Porumbescu. At the time, it was divided into two faculties: Performing Art and Composition, and Musicology, Orchestra Conducting and Pedagogy. In 1950, the drama department was turned into a separate Theater Institute, named after playwright Ion Luca Caragiale. It reunited with the Film Art Institute, a former branch of the Art Academy, in 1954, to form the UNATC. During this period, from 1950 to 1953, the veteran conductor George Georgescu, a close associate of Enescu who had himself studied cello at the institution a half century before, took his sole academic post, teaching the conducting class.George Georgescu's biographical sketch , at the 2008 George Georgescu International Contest for Performing Artists, Tulcea; retrieved August 21, 2009 In 2001, twelve years after the Romanian Revolution, the Romanian government awarded the institution the status of a National University.

It is named because the solid copper wires are \\"punched down\\" into short open-ended slots which are a type of insulation-displacement connector. These slots, usually cut crosswise (not lengthwise) across an insulating plastic bar, contain two sharp metal blades which cut through the wire's insulation as it is punched down. These blades hold the wire in position and make the electrical contact with the wire as well. Overview A punch-down tool with interchangeable blades Krone blocks Details of how wires are pushed into the clips of 66 Block A tool called a punch down tool is used to push the wire down firmly and properly into the slot. Some will automatically cut any excess wire off.Call recording blog, last accessed 30 Apr 2007 The exact size and shape of the tool blade varies by manufacturer, which can cause problems for those working on existing installations, especially when there is a poorly documented mix of different brands. Punch-down blocks are a very quick and easy way to connect wiring, as there is no stripping of insulation and no screws to loosen and tighten. Punch-down blocks are often used as patch panels, or as breakout boxes for PBX or other similar key phone systems with a 50-pin RJ21 (Amphenol) connector.Versadial, Call Recording Terms/Definitions, last accessed 8 June 2015 They are sometimes used in other audio applications, such as in reconfigurable patch panels. Often a separate tool known as a spudger is used to remove small stray pieces of cut off wiring stuck within punch-down blocks.  Reliable connections  It is possible to insert wiring without the proper tool, but this requires great care to avoid damaging the connectors. For example, pushing a screwdriver down the middle of the block is a bad practice as it forces the two blades of the terminal post apart, leading to bad contacts. It is also possible to punch-down multiple wires on top of each other in a single post of a punch-down block, but this practice is discouraged because of reliability concerns. If these multiple wires are of different thicknesses (wire gauges), it is even more likely that the thinner wire will develop contact problems. Similarly, stranded wire can be used on punch-down blocks, even though they were originally designed for solid wire connections. Marginal practices like these are strongly discouraged in large or mission-critical installations, because they can introduce extremely troublesome intermittent connections, as well as more-obvious outright bad connections. Once the contact blades in a punchdown block are \\"sprung apart\\" by poor practices, the entire block often must be replaced to restore reliable connections. In addition, punch-down blocks are being used to handle larger numbers of faster data signals, requiring greater care and proper procedures to control impedance and crosstalk.

He was head of the Catholic Church in Ireland during the reforms of the Second Vatican Council.  Early life and education  Conway was born in Dover Street, Belfast, on 22 February 1913 and baptised in St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral. He was the eldest of nine children. His father, Patrick Conway, was a house painter and ran a paint shop near Royal Avenue; his mother, Annie Donnolly, came from Carlingford on the Cooley Peninsula in the north of County Louth. He attended Boundary Street Primary School, St Mary's CBS (now St Marys CBGS Belfast), Queen's University, Belfast; St. Patrick's College, Maynooth; Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome. He emerged with a doctorate in Canon Law summa cum laude tying for a gold medal with a German Jesuit. Priesthood Conway was ordained for the Diocese of Down and Connor on 20 June 1937. After further studies in Rome in 1937‚Äì1941, he served on the staff of St. Malachy's College, Belfast, 1941‚Äì1942, teaching Latin and English. In 1942 he was appointed Professor of Moral Theology in Maynooth and of canon law the following year, holding both professorships until 1958. He was vice-president in 1957‚Äì1958. Two of his brothers, alumni of St. Mary's CBS, also became priests of the Diocese of Down and Connor. Canon Joseph Conway was ordained in 1947 and taught at St. Malachy's College until his appointment as President of St. Patrick's College, Knock in 1967. In 1986 he became Parish Priest of Kircubbin and died in 2008. An even younger brother, Canon Noel Conway was ordained in 1957 and also taught at St. Malachy's College where he became president in 1983. In 1990 he became Parish Priest of Strangford.  Episcopal career  Conway was appointed Titular Bishop of Neve and Auxiliary of Armagh on 31 May 1958, consecrated on 27 July 1958 in St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh where he served under Cardinal John D'Alton. He was made Administrator of St. Mary's Church in Dundalk and at forty-five was the youngest Bishop in Ireland at the time. After D'Alton's death Conway was appointed Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland on 9 September 1963 by Pope Paul VI. Conway was the leading Irish participant in the Second Vatican Council, at which his peritus was future Archbishop of Armagh Cahal Daly. On 22 February 1965 he was raised by Pope Paul VI to the cardinalate at the same consistory as his friend John Carmel Heenan of Westminster. Cardinal Conway was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of San Patrizio.  Pre- troubles cardinalate  In the years after Vatican II, Cardinal Conway worked hard to implement the decrees of the Council. Ireland was well ahead of other countries in introducing the vernacular into the Mass on 7 March 1965. Cardinal Conway marked the day by celebrating Mass in Irish in the Franciscan College in Gormanstown, Co. Meath. He reorganised the Irish Bishops Conference, setting up several commissions such as Justice and Peace, Laity, Social Welfare. He was invited to Poland in 1966 to the celebrations to mark one thousand years of Polish Christianity, but he was refused a visa by the Communist government and could not attend.  Cardinal Conway and the Troubles  Conway presided over the Irish Church at the outbreak of the Troubles and, as a native of Belfast and a priest of the diocese of Down and Connor, was well-placed to respond to the demands of the era. On 12 September 1971, after the introduction of internment, he and his fellow Northern bishops issued a statement in which they both criticised internment and denounced the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) as \\"the small group of people who are trying to secure a united Ireland by the use of force\\". In a much-quoted phrase of the Cardinal's the statement went on to pose the question, \\"Who in their sane senses wants to bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland?\\" Later that year, after the murder of an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier by the IRA near Caledon, Cardinal Conway said: \\"This latest and most cruel murder will send a chill of horror throughout the whole community. The persons responsible for such a barbaric act have lost all sense of the sacredness of human life and have thereby become less than human.\\" He was equally strong in his condemnation of loyalist paramilitaries who killed members of his diocese whose funerals he often attended. In May 1974 when James Devlin, a well-known Gaelic Athletic Association player in Co. Tyrone, was killed along with his wife Gertrude, around 2,000 people attended their funerals. On that occasion Conway said: \\"In the past three days I have looked upon coffins of seven utterly innocent people who have been ruthlessly cut down. During the past week eleven people have been murdered, one a member of the security forces, the other ten all Catholics. One must raise one's voice to high heaven against this slaughter of the innocent, irrespective of the religion of the victim.\\"  Ecumenical relations  Conway was keen throughout his time as Primate of All-Ireland to develop and maintain good relations with the leaders of other Christian churches on the island. He enjoyed a particularly close friendship with his fellow Primate in Armagh George Otto Simms. In 1973 Archbishop Simms invited Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey to lecture at the Refresher Course for Church of Ireland clergy. The visit took place from 30 April to 3 May and Simms arranged for Ramsey and Conway to meet. Conway held to the policy of church leaders acting together, so that they could best advance their cause for peace. In the 2006 releases of Public Records from the year 1975 there exists a one-page note of a meeting between Harold Wilson, then British Prime Minister, and the leaders of the main Churches in Northern Ireland (Cardinal Conway, Archbishop George Otto Simms, Temple Lundie, the Rev Harold Sloan, the Rev Donald Fraser). The background was the secret talks held between representatives of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Protestant clergy at a location in Feakle, County Clare, on Tuesday 10 December 1974. On 18 December 1974 the Protestant clergy met with Merlyn Rees, then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to report on their meeting with the IRA. These developments had led to an IRA ceasefire that began at midnight on Friday 22 December 1974 and was scheduled to end at midnight on 2 January 1975: > The Prime Minister said that he had been impressed by the earlier reference > to children going out to parties again. Peace created its own dynamic. The > Church leaders had planted a fragile tree (which one might call a Christmas > tree) in the desert of terrorism and we must consider how this tree could be > watered.  Claudy bombings enquiry verdict  On 24 August 2010, a report by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland was released in which the Ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, revealed his conclusions following an eight-year investigation into three terrorist bomb attacks in the village of Claudy on 31 July 1972 in which nine civilians, three of them children, died. A local priest, Father James Chesney, had been long rumoured to have been a leader of the IRA unit responsible for the murders. Hutchinson revealed that following the outrage, Father Chesney had been transferred by the Church across the border up to Moville, a small town in Inishowen in the north of County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, following discussions between Cardinal Conway, the then Primate of All Ireland, and William Whitelaw, who was then the British Government's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Almost all of Inishowen lies within the Diocese of Derry. This transfer was done with the full knowledge of Sir Graham Shillington, the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), who \\"would have preferred that Chesney be transferred to Tipperary\\". Se√°n Cardinal Brady denied that the wider Church was involved in a cover-up to protect a priest suspected of being involved in three IRA car bombings in Claudy in County Londonderry in 1972, and he accepted the report's findings.  Death and succession  For much of his time in Armagh, Conway did not have an auxiliary bishop to assist him in his many duties as bishop of a large diocese, head of the Irish Episcopal Conference and a senior advisor to Pope Paul VI. Only in 1974 was a former secretary, Fr. Francis Lenny, appointed as auxiliary bishop and Bishop of Rotdon and received Episcopal Ordination from Conway on 16 June 1974. Illness prevented the Cardinal from attending the canonisation of St. Oliver Plunkett in Rome in October 1975, a highly unusual absence given than he was a successor to Plunkett and that this was the first new canonization of an Irish saint for almost seven hundred years. The strain of overwork took its toll on Cardinal Conway, who contracted cancer late in 1976. He died after a short illness on 17 April 1977. The Requiem Mass was celebrated by the senior suffragan of the Armagh province, Bishop William Philbin, assisted by the late Cardinal's two brothers. He is buried in the grounds of St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh. In a debate in Seanad √âireann after his death tributes were paid to him by members of all parties. One Senator said of him: \\"His selection as Cardinal was a source of pride, joy and satisfaction to the whole country. As Cardinal and Primate of All Ireland he displayed the qualities of the truly great. Holding his high office at a time of undoubted difficulty, he gave courageous and faithful leadership without losing his inherent patience and gentleness. He will be remembered as a great churchman, a strong and fearless leader, a talented teacher and a devoted and patient pastor.\\" Brian Lenihan, on behalf of the Fianna F√°il party said: \\"During his period of primacy, in charge of the major church in this island, he had to cope with a period of very profound change within the Church itself. He coped with it successfully by combining a degree of realism and humanity in his administration of the Church during its period of change. Unfortunately during most of that time of primacy one had a period of almost revolutionary political developments causing great sorrow to all of us and he, in particular, must have suffered very intensely during that time which, unhappily, is still with us. At all stages during that development he showed leadership and courage and maintained a sense of dignity, showing at all times his abhorrence of all things violent and at the same time emphasising the basic virtues of peace, tolerance and charity which alone can bring all of us on this island out of the sorrow of the past ten years. After a relatively short interregnum he was succeeded as Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of All Ireland, and later as cardinal, by Maynooth College academic and native priest of the Armagh Archdiocese Tom√°s √ì Fiaich.

Club career Suffo was born in Ebolowa, Cameroon. He played in France, England, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before joining Norwegian team Odd Grenland in 2005. His form immediately helped Odd Grenland climb away from the relegation zone. In October of that year he was supposed to sign a contract with rivals, V√•lerenga, but he did not. During February 2006 he signed a short-term contract with Israeli team Maccabi Petah Tikva but was subsequently released at the end of this period. His career was littered with disciplinary problems; whilst at French club Nantes he was banned from playing for eight months for lashing out at a referee. At Sheffield United Suffo was part in a 21-man mass brawl during the First Division game dubbed as the Battle of Bramall Lane against West Bromwich Albion on 16 March 2002. This game had to be abandoned as Sheffield United were reduced to six players due to three red cards and two injuries. Suffo was one of the three who were sent off as he head-butted one of the opposition players. Afterwards, he was told that he had no future with the club and in April Suffo was sent to Spanish Second Division side Numancia on loan for the remainder of the season. In May he received a ¬£3,000 fine and was banned for three games in addition to a three-match suspension already served for his dismissal. In September 2007, he trialled with Scottish side Dundee United. On 22 July 2008, Suffo featured in a pre-season friendly for League One side Walsall against Aston Villa. He scored in this game to add to the two goals he notched the previous week in a game against Worcester City. In November 2008, Suffo signed a \\"pay as you play\\" deal with Wrexham, making his debut as a substitute during a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers.

Thailand's military history, dominated by her centrality in the south-eastern Asian region, the significance of her far flung and often hostile terrain, and the changing nature of military technology, has had a decisive impact on the evolution of both Thailand and her neighbours as modern nation states. In the post-war era, Thailand's military relationship with the United States has seen her play an important role in both the Cold War and the recent War on Terror, whilst her military's involvement in domestic politics has brought frequent international attention. State formation and Siam's regional conflicts (1300‚Äì1826) The Siamese military state emerged from the disintegration in the 14th century of the once powerful Khmer Empire. Once a powerful military state centred on what is today termed Cambodia, the Khmer dominated the region through the use of irregular military led by captains owing personal loyalty to the Khmer warrior kings, and leading conscripted peasants levied during the dry seasons. Primarily based around its infantry, the Khmer army was typically reinforced by war elephants and later adopted ballista artillery from China. By the end of the period, indigenous revolts amongst Khmer territories in Siam and Vietnam, and external attack from the independent kingdom of Champa, sapped Khmer strength. After the sack of the Khmer capital Angkor Wat by Champa forces in 1178‚Äì79, Khmer's ability to control its wider territories diminished rapidly. The first Siamese kingdom to gain independence, Sukhothai, soon joined to the newly independent Ayutthaya kingdom in 1350. After 1352 Ayutthaya became the main rival to the failing Khmer empire, leading to Ayutthayan conquest of the Khmer in 1431. King Naresuan entered Hanthawadi (now Pegu), mural painting by Phraya Anusatchitrakon, Wat Suwandararam, Ayutthaya. The subsequent years saw constant warfare as numerous states attempted to exploit the collapse of Khmer hegemony. As none of the parties in the region possessed a technological advantage, the outcome of battles was usually determined by the size of the armies. The use of war elephants continued, with some battles seeing personal combat between commanders on elephants.For example the fight between Burmese crown prince Mingyi Swa and by Siamese King Naresuan in the battle of Battle of Yuthahatthi on what is now reckoned as 18 January 1593, and observed as Armed Forces Day. In 1592, Nanda Bayin king of Toungoo ordered his son Mingyi Swa to attack Ayutthaya Naresuan encamped his armies at Yuddhahatthi. The Burmese then arrived, leading to the Battle of Yuddhahatthi. Naresuan was able to killed Mingyi Swa while both were on elephants during the battle. After that Burmese army withdrew from Ayutthaya. in 1599 Naresuan also occupied city of Pegu but Minye Thihathu Viceroy of Toungoo took Nanda Bayin and left for Toungoo. When Naresuan reached Pegu, what he found was only the city ruins. He requested Toungoo to send Nanda Bayin back to him but Minye Thihathu refused. After each victorious campaign, Ayutthaya carried away a number of conquered people to its own territory, where they were assimilated and added to the labour force. To the south, Ayutthaya easily achieved domination over the outlying Malay states. To the north, however, the kingdom of Burma posed a potential military threat to the Siamese kingdom. Although frequently split and divided in the 16th century, during periods of unity Burma could, and did, defeat Ayutthaya in battle, such as in 1564 and 1569. What followed was another prolonged period of Burmese disunity. Burma successfully invaded Ayutthaya again in 1767, this time burning the capital and temporarily dividing the country. General, later King, Taksin assumed power and defeated the Burmese at the battle of Pho Sam Ton Camp later in 1767.Arjarn Tony Moore/Khun Clint Heyliger Siamese & Thai Hero's & Heroines Royal Thai Army Radio and Television King Taksin's Liberating With Chinese political support, Taksin fought several campaigns against Vietnam, wresting Cambodia from Vietnamese control in 1779. In the north, Taksin's forces freed the kingdom of Lanna from Burmese control, creating an important buffer zone, and conquered the Laotian kingdoms in 1778. Ultimately, internal political dissent, in part fed by concerns over Chinese influence, brought the deposition of Taksin and the establishment of General Chakri as Rama I in 1782 and the founding of the Rattanakosin Kingdom with its new capital city at Bangkok. Military competition for regional hegemony continued, with continued Siamese military operations to maintain their control over the kingdom of Cambodia, and Siamese support for the removal of the hostile T√¢y S∆°n dynasty in Vietnam with the initially compliant ruler of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. In later years, the Vietnamese emperor was less cooperative, supporting a Cambodian rebellion against Siamese authority and placing a Vietnamese garrison in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, for several years.Buttinger, Joseph (1958). The Smaller Dragon: A Political History of Vietnam. Praeger, p. 305. Conflict with Burma was renewed in the two campaigns of the Burmo-Siamese war (1785‚Äì86), seeing initial Burmese successes in both years turned around by decisive Siamese victories. The accession of Rama II in 1809 saw a final Burmese invasion, the Thalang campaign, attempting to take advantage of the succession of power. Despite the destruction of Thalang, Rama's ultimate victory affirmed Siamese relative military superiority against Burma, and this conflict was to represent the final invasion of Siamese territory by Burma. Siam and the European military threat (1826‚Äì1932) The British victories over Burma in 1826 set the stage for a century in which the military history of Thailand was to be dominated by the threat of European colonialism. Initially, however, Siamese concern remained focused on its traditional rivals of Burma and Vietnam. Siam intervened in support of Britain against Burma in 1826, but her lackluster performance inspired Chao Anouvong's surprise attack on Korat. Lady Mo's resistance established her as a cultural heroine, and General Bodindecha's victory two years later established him as a major figure in Thai military history. His successful campaign in the Siamese‚ÄìVietnamese War (1841‚Äì1845) reaffirmed Siamese power over Cambodia. In 1849, weakening Burmese power encouraged revolt amongst the Burmese controlled Shan states of Kengtung and Chiang Hung. Chiang Hung repeatedly sought Siamese support, and ultimately Siam responded with the initial dispatch of forces in 1852. Both armies found difficulties campaigning in the northern mountainous highlands, and it took until 1855 before the Siamese finally reached Kengtung, though with great difficulty and the exhaustion of Siamese resources ultimately resulted in their retreat.Search-thais.com These wars continued to be fought in the traditional mode, with war elephants deployed in the field carrying light artillery during the period,De la Bissachere, cited Nossov, K. War Elephants, 2003, p. 40. often being a decisive factor in battle.Heath, I. Armies of the Nineteenth Century: Asia, Burma and Indo-China, 2003, p. 182. Meanwhile, the visible military weaknesses of China in the First and Second Opium Wars with Britain and later France between the 1830s and 1860s encouraged Siam to reject Chinese suzerainty in the 1850s. Siam, however, was under military and trade pressure itself from the European powers, and as King Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed in 1851: \\"We will have no more wars with Burma and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\\" Under Napoleon III, France escalated the military pressure on Siam from the east. France's naval interventions in Vietnam in the 1840s gave way to a concerted imperial campaign. Saigon fell in 1859, with French ascendancy in Vietnam being confirmed in 1874. France took Cambodia in 1863, combining it with Vietnam to form the colony of Indochina in 1887. From the south, Britain's involvement in the Larut and Klang wars of the 1870s increased both its grip over and political investment in the Malay states. From the north, Britain, triumphant in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, ultimately concluded its conquest of Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War and had incorporated the Kingdom of Burma into the British Raj by 1886. European military dominance was driven largely by the dominance of European naval power, coal powered vessels, increasingly iron clad, eclipsing the local brown water navies. Nonetheless, European campaigns remained limited by the difficulties and costs of logistics and the climate, especially the threat of malaria. Siam's response under King Mongkut was to commence a wide programme of reform on the Western model, which including the Siam military. The Royal Thai Army traces its origins as a standing force to Mongkut's creation of the Royal Siamese Army as a standing force in the European tradition in 1852. By 1887, Siam had permanent military commands, again in the European fashion, and by the end of the century, Siam had also acquired a Royal Navy from 1875 with a Danish naval reserve officer, Andreas du Plessis de Richelieu in charge, and after his departure in 1902 with the Thai noble title Phraya Chonlayutthayothin (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏•‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡πÇ‡∏¢‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡πå) under the reforms of Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartiwongse. Siam's increasing focus on centralised military force to deter European invasion came at the cost of the former decentralised military and political arrangements, beginning a trend towards centralised military power that would continue into 20th century Thailand. Despite the growing Siamese military strength, Siam's independence during much of the late-19th century hinged on the ongoing rivalry between Britain and France across the region, especially in the search for lucrative trade routes into the Chinese hinterlands. By developing an increasing sophisticated military force and playing one colonial rival against the other, successive Siamese monarchs were able to maintain an uneasy truce until the 1890s. Siamese army unit, Laos, 1893 The closing act of this struggle was the French occupation of eastern Thai territory in the Franco-Siamese war of 1893, which paved the way for an uneasy peace between Siam and France in the region for the next forty years. French Indochina's Governor-General had sent an envoy to Bangkok to bring Laos under French rule, backed by the threat of French military force. The Siamese government, mistakenly believing that they would be supported by the British, refused to concede their territories east of the Mekong River and instead reinforced their military and administrative presence there. Spurred on by the expulsion of French merchants on suspicion of opium smuggling, and the suicide of a French diplomat returning from Siam, the French took the Siamese refusal to concede its eastern territories as a causus belli. In 1893 the French ordered their navy to sail up the Chao Phraya River to Bangkok. With their guns trained on the Siamese royal palace, the French delivered an ultimatum to the Siamese to hand over the disputed territories and to pay indemnities for the fighting so far. When Siam did not immediately comply unconditionally to the ultimatum, the French blockaded the Siamese coast. Unable to respond by sea or on land, the Siamese submitted fully to the French terms, finding no support from the British. The conflict led to the signature of the Franco- Siamese Treaty in which the Siamese conceded Laos to France, an act that led to a significant expansion of French Indochina. In 1904 the French and the British put aside their differences with the Entente Cordiale, which ended their dispute over routes in southern Asia and also removed the Siamese option for using one colonial power as military protection against another. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 produced a compromise, largely in Britain's favour, between Britain and Siam over the disputed territories in the north of Malaya.U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Office of the Geographer, \\"International Boundary Study: Malaysia - Thailand Boundary\\" No. 57 , 15 November 1965. Siam's next conflict was its two-year involvement in the First World War, fighting on the side of the Entente Powers, the only independent Asian nation with land forces in Europe during the Great War. The result of this intervention in 1917 was the revision or complete cancellation of some of the unequal trade treaties with the United States, France, and the British Empire ‚Äì but not the return of the bulk of the disputed Siamese territories lost in the previous century. Second World War and Alliance with Japanese (1932‚Äì1945) For Thailand ‚Äì renamed from Siam in 1939 ‚Äì the Second World War involved both the bilateral struggle between the Axis and Allied forces in the region and the regional struggle across Southeast Asia between historic rivals. Like other regional actors, Thailand ‚Äì under military rule following the coup of 1932 and led by Prime Minister Major-General Plaek Pibulsonggram (popularly known as \\"Phibun\\") ‚Äì was to exploit the changes in power caused by the fall of France and the expansion of Japan to attempt to offset the losses of the previous century. Thailand's considerable investment in her army, based on a mixture of British and German equipment, and her air force ‚Äì a blend of Japanese and American aircraft ‚Äì was about to be put to use. The conflict fell into three broad phases. During the initial phase following the fall of France in 1940 and the establishment of Japanese bases in France's Far Eastern colonial territories, Thailand opened up an air offensive along the Mekong frontier, attacking Vientiane, Sisophon, and Battambang with relative impunity. In early January 1941, the Thai Army launched a land offensive, swiftly taking Laos whilst entering into a more challenging battle for Cambodia where the pursuit of French units there proved more difficult. At sea, however, the heavier forces of the French navy quickly achieved dominance, winning skirmishes at Ko Chang, followed by the French victory at the Battle of Ko Chang. The Japanese mediated the conflict, and a general armistice was agreed 28 January, followed by a peace treaty signed in Tokyo on 9 May,Young, Edward M.

During the second phase, Japan took advantage of the weakening British hold on the region to invade Siam, seeing the country as an obstacle on the route south to British-held Malaya and its vital oil supplies, and northwest to Burma. On 8 December 1941, after several hours of minimal fighting between Siamese and Japanese troops, Thailand acceded to Japanese demands for access. Later that month Phibun signed a mutual offensive- defensive alliance pact with JapanE. Bruce Reynolds. (1994) Thailand and Japan's Southern Advance 1940‚Äì1945. St. Martin's Press. giving the Japanese full access to Thai railways, roads, airfields, naval bases, warehouses, communications systems, and barracks. With Japanese support, Thailand annexed those former possessions in northern Malaya it had been unable to acquire under the 1909 treaty, and conducted a campaign against its former allies in the Shan states of Burma along its northern frontier.Judith A. Stowe. (1991) Siam becomes Thailand: A Story of Intrigue. Hurst & Company. By the final stages of the war, however, the weakening position of Japan across the region and the Japanese requisition of supplies and materiel reduced the military benefits to Siam, turning an unequal alliance into an increasingly obvious occupation. Allied air power achieved superiority over the country, bombing Bangkok and other targets. The sympathies of the civilian political elite, moved perceptibly against the Phibun regime and the military, forcing the prime minister from office in June 1944. With the fall of Japan, France and Britain insisted on the return of those lands annexed by Siam during the conflict, returning the situation to the situation ante bellum. The conflict highlighted the new importance of air power across the region, for example the use of dive bombers against French troops in 1941 or the use of air reconnaissance in the northern mountains. It had also highlighted the importance of well-trained pilots to effective air war.Elphick, Peter. (1995) Singapore, the Pregnable Fortress: A Study in Deception, Discord and Desertion. Coronet Books. Ultimately, the conflict emphasised the challenges of logistics across often impassable terrain, which generated expensive military campaigns ‚Äì a feature to reemerge in the postwar period during the conflicts in French Indochina. Thailand and regional Communism (1945‚Äì90) Thai soldiers boarding a USAF aircraft, during the Vietnam War. Thailand's military history in the post-war period was dominated by the growth of Communism across the region, which rapidly became one of the fault lines in the Cold War. Thailand's successive governments found that the Communist bloc in south-east Asia largely consisted of their historical military rivals, and were increasing drawn both into the regional struggle and into having to deal with Communist insurgency at home. Thailand's postwar leaders were mainly traditionalists, seeking to restore the prestige of the monarchy and to defeat the growth of Communism, which was closely associated with Thailand's traditional enemies, the Vietnamese ‚Äì now in open revolt against the French. Following Thailand's participation in the Korean War,The United States Army Homepage and with the steady growth of US involvement in the region, Thailand formally became a US ally in 1954 with the formation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Whilst the war in Indochina was being fought between the Vietnamese and the French, Thailand ‚Äì disliking both her old rivals equally ‚Äì initially refrained from entering the conflict, but once it became a war between the US and the Vietnamese Communists, Thailand committed itself strongly to the US side. Thailand concluded a secret military agreement with the US in 1961, and in 1963 openly allowed the use of their territories as air bases and troop bases for US forces before finally sending her own troops to Vietnam. A Royal Thai Volunteer Regiment (the \\"Queen's Cobras\\") and later the Royal Thai Army Expeditionary Division (\\"Black Panthers\\"), then a brigade, served in South Vietnam from September 1967 to March 1972.Stanton, 'Vietnam Order of Battle,' 270‚Äì271. Thailand was however more involved with the secret war and covert operations in Laos from 1964 to 1972. The Vietnamese retaliated by supporting the Communist Party of Thailand's insurgency in various parts of the country. By 1975 relations between Bangkok and Washington had soured; eventually all US military personnel and bases were forced to withdraw and direct Thai involvement in the conflict came to an end. The Communist victory in Vietnam further emboldened the Communist movement within Thailand. After the Thammasat University massacre in 1976 and the repressive policies of Tanin Kraivixien sympathies for the movement increased, and by the late 1970s it was estimated that the movement had about 12,000 armed insurgents, mostly based in the northeast along the Laotian-Khmer border. Counter-insurgency campaigns by the Thai military meant that by the 1980s insurgent activities had been largely defeated. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978 to remove the Pol Pot regime ‚Äì tacitly supported by Thailand and China ‚Äì brought the Vietnamese-Thailand conflict up to the Thai border, resulting in small border raids and incursions by Vietnamese against the remaining Khmer Rouge camps inside Thai territory, that lasted until 1988. Thailand, meanwhile, with US support sponsored the creation of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, which operated against the new Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government from 1979 onwards from bases inside Thailand. Similar small skirmishes emerged along the Thai-Laotian border in 1987‚Äì1988. Thai and US Marines plan to eliminate hostile forces firing on them during a mock mechanized raid, 2011-02-11  Post-communist period  The last twenty years of Thailand's military history has been dominated less by the threat of external attack, but by the role of the Thai military in internal politics. For most of the 1980s, Thailand was ruled by prime minister Prem Tinsulanonda, a democratically inclined leader who restored parliamentary politics. Thereafter the country remained a democracy apart from a brief period of military rule from 1991 to 1992, until, in 2006 mass protests against the Thai Rak Thai party's alleged corruption prompted the military to stage a coup d'√©tat. A general election in December 2007 restored a civilian government, but the issue of the Thai military's frequent involvement in domestic politics remains. Meanwhile, the long-running southern insurgency, waged by the ethnic Malays and Islamic rebels in the three southern provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat intensified in 2004, with attacks on ethnic Thai civilians by insurgents escalating.The New York Times The Royal Thai Armed Forces in turn responded with force. Casualties currently stands at 155 Thai military personnel killed against 1,600 insurgents killed and about 1,500 captured, against the backdrop of about 2,729 civilian casualties. Strong US military support for Thailand under President Bush, as part of the US War on Terror, assisted the Thai military in this counter-insurgency role, although discussions continue in the Royal Thai Government as to the role of the military, vis-√†-vis civilians, in the leadership of this campaign. US Air force units have also been permitted to use Thai air bases once more, flying missions over Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001 and 2003 respectively. The Thai military maintains strong regional relations under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) organisation, illustrated by the annual Cobra Gold exercises, the latest in 2018, involving soldiers from Thailand, the US, Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia. The exercises are the largest military exercises in Southeast Asia. This association, bringing together many former enemies, plays an important part in ensuring ongoing peace and stability across the region.

It was designed by Boris Shpitalniy and Irinarkh Komaritsky and entered production in 1934. ShKAS was used in the majority of Soviet fighters and bombers and served as the basis for the ShVAK cannon.  Description  ShKAS is a gas-operated revolver-type machine gun; it has a single chamber in which the pin strikes the primer. A key element of the ShKAS' high rate of fire is the revolving drum (feed cage) that holds ten rounds and provides a very smooth, progressive removal of the cartridges from their disintegrating link belt. Another element is the lightweight recoiling portion of the gun, which weighs only 921 grams (2.07 lb). Diagram of the ShKAS feed system operation. A declassified US analysis of the feed system, based on models captured during the Korean War, reads:Chinn, pp. 78‚Äì79 (Ian V. Hogg called the ShKAS feeding system a \\"squirrel cage\\".) After analysing the less unusual parts of the ShKAS, the US source concludes: Although ShKAS is best known for its high rate of fire, it did have provision for slower cyclic rates by lowering the gas-pressure. This was done by \\"changing the position of the holes in the gas regulator, which comes with holes of three different sizes: 2.1 mm (1/12-inch), 2.5 mm (1/10-inch) and 3.2 mm (1/8-inch). The smaller the orifice used, the more moderate is the rate of fire obtained.\\"Chinn, p. 80  Variants  ShKAS in a ring mount Initial production consisted of cable-charged wing-mounted and turret-mounted ShKAS with a synchronized version entering service in 1936. By 1952 Western intelligence had identified five different models, all including the number \\"426\\" in their markings:Chinn, p. 72 * a prototype \\"426\\" appeared in 1932 * KM-33, in flexible role, appeared in 1933 * KM-35, in flexible role (1934) and wing-mounted (1935) * KM-36, in flexible role (1935) and propeller- synchronized (1937); the latter had an extra-long barrel * a 1941 model, wing- mounted \\"KM\\" stands for \\"constructed model\\", i.e. production. The intended role was marked with the letters \\"T\\" for flexible, \\"K\\" for wing, and \\"S\\" synchronized. The flexible version was usually mounted in a Soviet copy of the Scarff ring.Chinn, p. 73 The 1937 model had slightly higher maximum rate of fire of 2,000 rounds per minute. The amount of ammunition normally carried was 750 rounds for the fixed models and 1,000 to 1,500 for the flexible.Chinn, p. 79 Soviet archives indicate the following production volumes, by year:Shirokorad, p. 73; there is no number given for 1936, 1939 and 1941‚Äì1942 * 1933 ‚Äî 365 produced * 1934 ‚Äî 2,476 * 1935 ‚Äî 3,566 * 1937 ‚Äî 13,005 * 1938 ‚Äî 19,687 * 1940 ‚Äî 34,233 * 1943 ‚Äî 29,450 * 1944 ‚Äî 36,255 * 1945 ‚Äî 12,455 * Ultra-ShKAS: In 1939, a small number of Ultra-ShKAS were produced featuring a firing rate of 3,000 rounds per minute but these saw only limited use due to reliability problems.  Effectiveness  The ShKAS was the fastest-firing rifle calibre aircraft armament in general service in World War II. A one- second burst from the four ShKAS of a Polikarpov I-153 or Polikarpov I-16 placed 120 bullets within 15 angular mils at 400 meters (1,312 feet) giving a firing density of 5 bullets per square meter of the sky. Moreover, the ShKAS was unusually light as well; the four guns, with 650 rounds of ammunition each, weighed a total of only 160 kg (350 lb). ShKAS wasn't problem-free though. Soviet machine-gun technician Viktor M. Sinaisky recalled:  Gun specifications  * Cartridge: 7.62√ó54mmR * Calibre: * Rate of fire: 1,800 rounds/min wing- or turret-mounted; 1,625 rounds/min synchronized. UltraShKAS: 3,000 rounds/min. * Muzzle velocity: * Weight: empty; with 650 rounds of ammunition.  7.62 mm ammunition specifications  Although chambered in the 7.62√ó54mmR, the ShKAS guns used cartridges specially built for them to smaller tolerances; to distinguish them from the regular 7.62 ammunition, the Cyrillic letter \\"Sh\\" (–®) was imprinted on the bottom of the cases.

It is located at the corner of Boulevard Saint-Germain and Rue Saint-Beno√Æt, in Saint-Germain-des- Pr√©s in the 6th arrondissement. The nearest underground station is Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s, served by line 4 of Paris M√©tro. The coffeehouse still remains a popular hang-out spot for celebrities and its status attracts numerous tourists.  History  Philippe Derome, Le Flore, oil on canvas, 1974 The caf√© was opened in the 1880s, during the Third Republic. The name is taken from a sculpture of Flora, the goddess of flowers and the season of spring in Roman mythology, located on the opposite side of the boulevard. Authors Joris-Karl Huysmans and Remy de Gourmont were two of the first well- known regulars. In the late 19th century, Charles Maurras wrote his book Au signe de Flore on the caf√©'s first floor, where in 1899 the Revue d'Action Fran√ßaise was also founded. The Caf√© de Flore became a popular hub of famous writers and philosophers. Georges Bataille, Robert Desnos, L√©on-Paul Fargue, Raymond Queneau were all regulars, and so was Pablo Picasso. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was known to be a frequent patron of Caf√© de Flore during his years in France in the 1920s. The classic Art Deco interior of all red seating, mahogany and mirrors has changed little since World War II. Like its main rival, Les Deux Magots, it has been frequented by numerous French intellectuals during the post-war years. In his essay \\"A Tale of Two Cafes\\" and his book Paris to the Moon, American writer Adam Gopnik mused over the possible explanations of why the Flore had become, by the late 1990s, much more fashionable and popular than Les Deux Magots, despite the fact that the latter caf√© was associated with Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, and other famous thinkers of the 1940s and 1950s. A Romanian thinkers league also frequented the place, for example: Emil Cioran, Eugene Ionesco and essayist Benjamin Fondane.

Ritts also produced and directed many independent videos and television spots as president of Mark Ritts Productions, Inc., for clients around the world. Biography Ritts was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard with a degree in English literature. Being the son of noted puppeteers Paul and Mary Ritts, he pursued a sideline in puppetry, starring in PBS's The Real Adventures of Sherlock Jones and Proctor Watson and NBC's The Pink Panther Show, among many others. In the 1980s he was the puppeteer for the Philadelphia-area produced Starstuff. Throughout the 1990s, Ritts was the voice and manipulator of Kino, the Emmy Award-winning puppet co-host of the PBS series Storytime, as well as one of the show's writers. From 1992 to 1998, he participated on CBS's Beakman's World. In it, Ritts starred as Lester, a disgruntled actor (with a bad agent) in a rat suit who reluctantly helps Beakman with his experiments and trades barbs with Josie, Liza and Phoebe. The character was originally conceived as a puppet character, but at the last minute, the show's producers decided he would be a costumed actor. Ritts also operated the Herb penguin puppet, with the voice provided by Alan Barzman. The program has been televised in nearly 90 countries around the world, and is seen in syndication throughout the United States. After moving to California from the East Coast in 1994, Mark wrote and produced a Barney the Dinosaur special for Fox, as well as a one-hour documentary on microbiology called Creators of the Future, which debuted in prime time on PBS in 1999.

The film stars James Brolin, Kathleen Lloyd, John Marley and Ronny Cox, along with real-life sisters Kim and Kyle Richards (as Brolin's daughters). It tells the story of an unmanned, self-driving mysterious car which goes on a murderous rampage, terrorizing the residents of a small town. The film was produced and distributed by Universal Studios, and was influenced by numerous \\"road movies\\" of the 1970s including Steven Spielberg's thriller Duel (1971) and Roger Corman's Death Race 2000 (1975). Plot Two bicyclists cycling on a canyon are followed by a mysterious matte black car down the road. At a bridge, the car proceeds to crush one cyclist against the wall and ram the other from behind, catapulting him off the bridge. A hitchhiker, hoping to get a ride, encounters the car and insults it after it purposely tries to run him down. In response, the car runs over him several times and leaves. The local sheriff's office, called to the first of a series of hit and run deaths, gets a lead on the car that appears heavily customized and has no license plate, as pointed out by Amos Clemens (R. G. Armstrong) after he sees it run over the hitchhiker. That night, in an apparent bid to kill Amos, the car instead runs over Sheriff Everett Peck (John Marley), leaving Chief Deputy Wade Parent (James Brolin) in charge. During the resulting investigation, an eyewitness to the accident states that there was no driver inside the car, furthering Wade's confusion. Wade asks his girlfriend, Lauren (Kathleen Lloyd), who is a teacher at the local school, to cancel the upcoming marching band rehearsals for their safety. Lauren and her friend, who is Wade's deputy Luke Johnson's (Ronny Cox) wife, ask him to let them rehearse, to which Luke unwittingly agrees. The car enters the town and attacks the school marching band as it rehearses at the local show ground. It chases the group of teachers and students into a cemetery. Curiously enough, the vehicle will not enter onto the consecrated ground as Lauren taunts the purported driver that any of the townsfolk have yet to see. Seemingly in anger, the car destroys a brick gate post and leaves. The police chase the automobile along highways throughout the desert before it turns on them, destroying several squad cars and killing five of Wade's deputies in the process. Wade confronts the vehicle and is surprised to see that none of his bullets put a dent on the car's windshield or tires. After trying to open the door (when it is revealed that the car has no door handles), Wade is knocked out by the car door when it opens by itself, and the car escapes. After that, Wade decided to get her some spare clean clothes. That evening, Lauren, on her way home to pick up her things, is killed when the car jumps driving straight through her house and rams her, right when she is speaking to Wade over the phone. Luke puts forward to a grief-stricken and maddened Wade the theory that it acted in revenge for the insults hurled on it by Lauren and notes that it apparently did not enter the cemetery because \\"the ground is hallowed,\\" a biblical reference. Wade concocts a plan to stop the car by burying it beneath a controlled explosion in the canyons that lie outside of town. After discovering it waiting for them in his own garage, they are forced to carry out his plans post haste. He is pursued by the car into a mountainous canyon area where his remaining deputies have set a trap for the machine. In a final confrontation, Wade and Luke at the edge of a cliff bait the car into running straight at them, then jump aside as it goes over the cliff. With the dynamite detonated and the rubble falling on it, a monstrous, demonic visage appears in the smoke and fire of the explosion, shocking the deputies. The final scenes show Wade refusing to believe what the group saw in the flames, despite Luke's insistence about what he saw. The film concludes, with the car prowling the streets of downtown Los Angeles, clearly having survived.

There were four cars built for the film in six weeks. Three were used as stunt mules, the fourth for closeups. The stunt mules were destroyed during production, while the fourth is now in a private collection. Parts of the film were shot in St. George, Hurricane-LaVerkin Bridge, Zion, Kanab, Crazy Horse Canyon and Glen Canyon in Utah. The late Church of Satan leader Anton LaVey was given a \\"Technical Adviser\\" credit on the film. His quote, \\"Oh great brothers of the night who rideth upon the hot winds of hell, who dwelleth in the Devil's lair; move and appear\\", is given in the opening credits and is taken from the \\"Invocation of Destruction\\" in The Satanic Bible. The film's main theme, heard predominantly throughout, is a reworked, orchestral version of the Dies Irae. Reception and home release The film was panned by critics, citing poor dialogue and acting. The film holds a 28% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.

Early life Zaret was born in New York City and attended West Virginia University and Brooklyn Law School, where he received an LLB. Career He scored his first major success in 1937, when he teamed up with Saul Chaplin and Sammy Cahn to co-write the pop standard \\"Dedicated to You.\\" The early 1940s brought some collaborations with Alex C. Kramer and Joan Whitney, including 1941's \\"It All Comes Back to Me Now\\" and the socially conscious, WWII-themed \\"My Sister and I.\\" Zaret wrote the lyrics for an English translation of the French Resistance song \\"La Complainte du Partisan\\" (\\"The Song of the French Partisan\\"). The song became popular after it was recorded by Leonard Cohen and others as \\"The Partisan\\". In 1944 he and Lou Singer wrote the popular hit novelty song \\"One Meatball\\", based on a song popular among Harvard undergraduates.\\"Song for Hard Times\\", Harvard Magazine, May‚ÄìJune 2009 =Unchained Melody= Zaret's biggest success, though, was \\"Unchained Melody,\\" a song he co-wrote with film composer Alex North for the 1955 prison film Unchained (hence the title), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. No fewer than three versions of the song‚Äîby Les Baxter, Al Hibbler, and Roy Hamilton‚Äîhit the U.S. Top Ten that year, with Hibbler's version ranking as the best-known for the next ten years. The song was also recorded successfully by Jimmy Young and Liberace, and covered by countless others, but The Righteous Brothers' 1965 version‚Äîgiven a supremely romantic production by Phil Spector‚Äîbecame the definitive take, reaching the U.S. pop Top Five. That recording was revived in 1990 thanks to its inclusion in the film, Ghost, and nearly reached the U.S. Top Ten all over again, whilst it reached No.1 in the U.K on this release. Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, Cliff Richard, Roy Orbison and Donny Osmond also recorded versions of the song. This song is unique in that it has made No.1 on the U.K. singles charts in four different guises by four different artists over a period of nearly fifty years: Jimmy Young (1955), The Righteous Brothers (1990), Robson & Jerome (1995) and Gareth Gates (2002). The latter three versions have all recorded certified sales in excess of one million copies in the U.K. alone. =Children's music= Zaret turned his attention to educational children's music in the late 1950s, collaborating with Lou Singer on a six-album series called \\"Ballads for the Age of Science\\"; different volumes covered space, energy and motion, experiments, weather, and nature. The records were quite successful, and the songs \\"Why Does the Sun Shine\\" (aka \\"The Sun Is a Mass of Incandescent Gas\\") and \\"A Shooting Star Is Not a Star\\" were even covered by alternative rock band They Might Be Giants in 1993 and 2009, respectively.

Carbapenems are highly resistant to the Œ≤-lactamase enzymes produced by many multiple drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, thus play a key role in the treatment of infections not readily treated with other antibiotics. Imipenem was patented in 1975 and approved for medical use in 1985. It was discovered via a lengthy trial-and-error search for a more stable version of the natural product thienamycin, which is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. Thienamycin has antibacterial activity, but is unstable in aqueous solution, so impractical to administer to patients. Imipenem has a broad spectrum of activity against aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is particularly important for its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Enterococcus species. It is not active against MRSA, however. Medical uses =Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and resistance= Acinetobacter anitratus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Clostridium perfringens are generally susceptible to imipenem, while Acinetobacter baumannii, some Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis have developed resistance to imipenem to varying degrees. Not many species are resistant to imipenem except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Oman) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. =Coadministration with cilastatin= Imipenem is rapidly degraded by the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase 1 when administered alone, and is almost always coadministered with cilastatin to prevent this inactivation. Adverse effects Common adverse drug reactions are nausea and vomiting. People who are allergic to penicillin and other Œ≤-lactam antibiotics should take caution if taking imipenem, as cross-reactivity rates are high. At high doses, imipenem is seizurogenic. Mechanism of action Imipenem acts as an antimicrobial through inhibiting cell wall synthesis of various Gram- positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It remains very stable in the presence of Œ≤-lactamase (both penicillinase and cephalosporinase) produced by some bacteria, and is a strong inhibitor of Œ≤-lactamases from some Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to most Œ≤-lactam antibiotics.

Twitch gameplay is a type of video gameplay scenario that tests a player's response time. Action games such as shooters, sports, multiplayer online battle arena, and fighting games often contain elements of twitch gameplay. For example, first-person shooters such as Counter-Strike as well as Call of Duty shooters require quick reaction times for the players to shoot enemies, and fighting games such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat require quick reaction times to attack or counter an opponent. Other video game genres may also involve twitch gameplay. For example, the puzzle video game Tetris gradually speeds up as the player makes progress. Twitch gameplay keeps players actively engaged with quick feedback to their actions, as opposed to turn-based gaming that involves waiting for the outcome of a chosen course of action. Twitch can be used to expand tactical options and play by testing the skill of the player in various areas (usually reflexive responses) and generally add difficulty (relating to the intensity of \\"twitching\\" required). Fast chess, chess played with short time limits between moves, is an example of adding a twitch gameplay element to a turn-based game. Conversely, checkpoints and extra lives are common game mechanics in twitch gaming that attempt to reduce the penalty for errors in play, adding an element of turn- based gameplay. Traditionally, however, the term \\"twitch game\\" has been applied to simple arcade, console, and computer games that lack an element of strategy and are based solely upon a player's reaction time. History \\"Twitch\\" refers to the motion the player makes, a sudden movement or reaction to an event on the screen. An early use of the term was by Vern Raburn of Microsoft in 1981. Most early computer, arcade, and console games are considered to be \\"twitch games.\\" They mostly involved \\"see and react\\" situations. For instance, Kaboom! had players rapidly catching bombs that a mad bomber threw from a rooftop. Most classic arcade games such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man were also twitch-based. As games and their control inputs evolved, the games started to favor strategy over reaction, early turn-based games being the most prevalent examples. Such games required players to plan each move and anticipate the opponent's moves ahead of time. Not unlike chess, early strategy games focused on setting pieces and then moving them one turn at a time while the opponent did the same. Many of these games were based on tabletop games. The introduction of the internet, and its suitability as a playable medium, facilitated many of the features of today's mainstream games. However, that is not to say that all games with a base in strategy do not include room for twitch gameplay. Soon after turn-based strategy games were introduced, real-time strategy games were introduced to the video gaming market, beginning with Herzog Zwei and then Dune II and eventually leading to popular titles such as Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and StarCraft. While strategy was still the primary objective, these games played out in real time. Players were required to have fast reactions to enemies' movements and attacks. Early first-person shooters were very much like early games in general; fast reactions were required and little strategy or thought went into the gameplay. Even the youngest players were able to understand the concept, which may have been the reason such games became instantly popular among a large demographic. Many of the earliest first person games were considered cookie cutter copies of each other; Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, and many others looked, played, and felt the same, especially since many shooters were built off the Doom engine. Enemy AI was predictable and levels were simple mazes with secrets and side rooms. While some games included the ability to look up and down, it was rarely required of the player. Gameplay today Games have become more complex as technology has improved. Today, nearly every genre of video game contains some level of \\"twitch\\", though turn-based strategy games have remained roughly untouched by the phenomenon. First-person shooters remain the predominant genre to emphasize twitch gameplay. Some games include elements that take players back in nostalgic gameplay in the form of quick time events or QTEs. These events decide the fate of the player by displaying a keystroke or keystrokes(often referred to as combos or combinations) that the player must input quickly. While the concept is not new, the term is often attributed to Yu Suzuki, director of the game Shenmue. Shenmue was an adventure game at its core and it introduced QTEs as a way to keep players interested during extended cut scenes. Other games have since adopted this method (e.g. Resident Evil 4). \\"Just Chatting Twitch\\" \\"boostroyal.com\\". Retrieved 2020-9-19 Twitch in shooters Early shooter games were two- dimensional, such as the shoot 'em up Space Invaders, though some had the guise of being three-dimensional, such as the rail shooter Space Harrier. Players operated on a single level with enemies, and with the introduction of three-dimensional environments along with enhanced graphics and network capability, shooters continued to be a major influence in the gaming world. The overall tactics and strategies remained the same. Games such as Quake encouraged fast-paced destruction. Automatic weapons and rocket launchers ensured quick gameplay. It was still a \\"twitch game,\\" but over time, gameplay success was determined by more than merely having the fastest reactions. As games evolved, additional layers of strategy were demanded. Over time, strategy won over twitch, especially in team- and objective-based games. A primary example of this would be the game Counter-Strike ‚Äì originally a modification of the popular game Half-Life that quickly became one of the most popular competitive first-person shooters to date. The base game included objective-based game types that limited the player to a single life per round. Players obtained in-game cash to purchase better weapons and armor. Twitch became a scenario-based event as players wanted to retain the weapons they had worked hard to purchase, knowing a death resulted in losing all the equipment they had obtained. Many players realized that teamwork and strategy would win over the \\"run and gun\\" tactic. Twitching became something that happened in moments of need versus all the time; for example, a player might have walked around a corner and found an enemy there, in which one would have to react immediately to kill the opponent. With further advancement in technology and improvement of the artificial intelligence of computer-controlled enemies, games became more and more about strategy in the shooter genre. A player had to be able to aim precisely to conserve ammo, and often flank large groups of enemies. Today's shooters still have scenarios where players will have a twitch reaction, but often even those scenarios can be avoided by taking one's time. Even highly skilled gamers still find themselves in twitch scenarios in shooters. Most are predominantly online, where the actions of the enemy team are unscripted and difficult to predict. Many skilled snipers in these games find themselves \\"twitching\\" when flanked; the instinctual reaction is for one to switch to a secondary weapon, which is most often an inaccurate handgun, and spray fire while attempting to find cover. The predominant reason that shooters do not limit the effectiveness of twitch scenarios is because the average gamer has little time to actually play the game, especially if they play in online lobbies, with the amount of time the average gamer has to play games limited to between two and four hours per day. A game that requires a large amount of skill may deter these gamers from playing at all. At the same time, due to the popularity of the internet, there is a large number of gamers who favor twitch (skill) over strategy. In recent years, videos have appeared across the internet displaying montages of twitch in-game kills. Most of these depict players with sniper rifles hardly aiming or not even aiming at all and getting such kills. Traditional 2D shooters have survived in the form of bullet hell shooters, which place a strong emphasis on quick reaction times.

His work, especially in partnership with fellow Belgian Johan Gielen, has produced some of trance music's biggest hits. He has been successful as a solo artist and also as a partner in several collaborative efforts. Early years At the age of eighteen, Sven played in an eccentric group of musicians that performed under the name \\"Mea Culpa\\". It was during one of their performances at a Belgian contest for rock bands that he was noticed. The yearly event is called Humo's Rock Rally and he was approached by Geert Blanchart, who competed in short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Blanchart, in turn, introduced Sven to a friend of his. That friend was Olivier Adams and was already established in the music industry and was known for their synthesizer work with the acid band Lords of Acid. It was the interest of Olivier Adams that helped Sven keep moving in a successful direction with his music. The use of Adams' recording studio helped Sven by allowing him to tape several tracks under a few aliases. Mainstream success Adams too was the one that introduced Sven to Antler-Subway Records. This is the time that Sven met Johan Gielen. The two paired up to produce tracks as Bodyheat and Airscape. A significant portion of Sven's composing and production work was done with Johan Gielen. They worked together as Svenson & Gielen for more than a few years. The Airscape remix of Delerium feat. Sarah McLachlan's \\"Silence\\" is the duo's biggest hit, their remix of Delerium's \\"After All\\" was also very successful. It made its way onto several compilations like the Euphoria series of compilations. It was when their contract with Antler-Subway expired that the rapid successes came one after the other. The duo hooked up with Dutch dance organizer ID&T; and started to produce for them. The first track was the epic \\"The Beauty of Silence\\". This was soon followed by \\"Twisted\\" and \\"We Know What You Did\\".

He rose through the ranks of the Home Office and was appointed an Assistant Secretary in 1913. During this time, he served as private secretary to both Thomas Cochrane (1903-1905) and Herbert Samuel (1905-1908) when they were Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State at the Home Office.

Uses Dehydropeptidase is an enzyme found in the kidney and is responsible for degrading the antibiotic imipenem. Cilastatin can therefore be combined intravenously with imipenem in order to protect it from degradation, prolonging its antibacterial effect. Imipenem alone is an effective antibiotic and can be given without cilastatin. Cilastatin itself does not have antibiotic activity, although it has been proved to be active against a zinc- dependent beta-lactamase that usually confers antibiotic resistance to certain bacteria, more precisely, the carbapenem family of antibiotics. This property is due to the physicochemical similarities between membrane dipeptidase (MDP), the compound it is usually set to target, and the bacterial metallo-beta- lactamase carried by the CphA gene. The combination allows the antibiotic to be more effective by changing the pharmacokinetics involved. Thus imipenem/cilastatin, like amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, is a commonly used combination product.

He was assassinated outside his law office shortly after he had won the Democratic nomination for Alabama Attorney General on a platform of reforming the rife corruption and vice in Phenix City. Early life Patterson was born in the New Site community in Tallapoosa County sometime between 1891 and 1897, depending on what source is used. According to his driver's license at the time of his death, his date of birth was January 27, 1894. He grew up on a farm with seven siblings but left Alabama as a teenager to seek a better life. He eventually settled in East Texas, working as a day laborer on farms and oil fields. In Texas, Patterson joined the Third Texas Infantry, earning a commission as a second lieutenant. He began dating Agnes Benson of Colbert County, Ala., and they married on July 14, 1917. In July 1918, Patterson deployed to France as an officer with the 36th Infantry Division. In France, Patterson was seriously wounded near St. Etienne. For his service, France awarded him the Croix de Guerre with a silver gilt star. Patterson spent a lengthy convalescence after he was discharged before he returned to his native Alabama to attend college. He earned a teacher's certificate from what is now Jacksonville State University in 1921 and served as a high school principal in both Clay County and Coosa County. He completed his bachelor's degree in history from the University of Alabama in 1926, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. He would go on to earn his law degree in just one year from the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee. After he opened law practices in Opelika and Alexander City, he would settle in Phenix City in 1933. Political career Patterson began his political career in 1937 as a member of the Phenix City Board of Education. By 1940, he was also chairman of the Russell County Draft Board. In 1946, he was elected to the Alabama State Senate, where he served from 1947 to 1951 and helped introduce several important bills, including the Wallace-Cater Act, which allowed the use of state and municipal bonds to finance industrial plants, and the Trade School Act, which formed many of Alabama's trade schools. In the early 1950s, Patterson became involved with the Russell Betterment Association (RBA), which was formed to combat the rampant vice and corruption occurring in Phenix City and Russell County. That involvement resulted in Patterson's office being set ablaze in 1952. The RBA had been thwarted at electing its candidates at the local level and so it decided to nominate candidates for statewide office. Since Patterson had held a Senate seat, he was seen as the perfect candidate for the office of the Attorney General. He obtained a plurality in the 1954 Democratic primary and staged a runoff in May with Lee \\"Red\\" Porter of Gadsden. In the runoff, early election results saw Patterson gain a seemingly- insurmountable lead. That allegedly led Porter's Phenix City supporters to buy and to steal votes throughout the state to attempt to keep Patterson from victory. The results continued going back and forth until June 10, when the Executive Committee of the Alabama Democratic Party declared Patterson as the winner. Assassination and aftermath On the evening of June 18, 1954, Patterson was working in his law office in the Coulter Building in Phenix City. As he left at about 9 p.m., he walked to his car, which was parked in an alley off Fifth Avenue next to the Elite Cafe. An unidentified assailant walked up to him, pushed a gun in his mouth, and shot him three times. One cartridge was found wedged in an opening, where two or three front teeth had been knocked out. Patterson was well aware that his life was in danger, commenting just one night earlier to a church group, \\"I have only a 100-to-1 chance of ever being sworn in as attorney general.\\" Reaction from the state was swift. Within weeks, Governor Gordon Persons declared martial law in the city, effectively giving the Alabama National Guard the law enforcement duties in the city and the county. The state sent special prosecutors from Montgomery to replace the local judiciary. Within six months, the Phenix City machine was dismantled. A special grand jury in Birmingham handed down 734 indictments against local law enforcement officers, elected officials, and local business owners connected to organized crime. Three officials were specifically indicted for Patterson's murder: Chief Deputy Sheriff Albert Fuller, Circuit Solicitor Arch Ferrell, and Attorney General Si Garrett. Of the three, only Fuller was convicted; he was sentenced to life imprisonment but was released after 10 years. Fuller died within the same year as his parole and claimed his innocence until his dying day.Eidsmoe, John, \\"Legalized Gambling, America's Bad Bet\\", 1995 Ferrell was acquitted and Garrett was never brought to trial, as he was convalescing in a mental institution for most of the year after Patterson's murder. Patterson's son, John Malcolm Patterson, assumed the Democratic nomination for Attorney General; he won and took office in 1955. In 1958, John was elected as Alabama governor, running on a platform of fighting organized crime and public corruption. Legacy A memorial statue of Patterson stands on the grounds of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery. \\"Phenix City\\" by Edwin Strickland and Gene Wortsman written in 1955 provides an accurate account, from eyewitnesses, of the events of the day. Alan Grady's book When Good Men Do Nothing: The Assassination of Albert Patterson chronicles the events leading to and following the murder. Margaret Anne Barnes' book The Tragedy and Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama chronicles the factual events leading up to the murder of Albert Patterson. Ace Atkins wrote a novelization of the events surrounding Patterson's assassination and the ensuing cleanup of Phenix City, entitled Wicked City. These events were highly dramatized in the 1955 biopic film noir The Phenix City Story, directed by Phil Karlson.

Like other benzodiazepine derivatives, it has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. However, it is used primarily in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is an active metabolite of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, prazepam, pinazepam, and medazepam. Nordazepam is among the longest lasting (longest half-life) benzodiazepines, and its occurrence as a metabolite is responsible for most cumulative side-effects of its myriad of pro-drugs when they are used repeatedly at moderate-high doses; the nordazepam metabolite oxazepam is also active (and is a more potent, full BZD-site agonist), which contributes to nordazepam cumulative side-effects but occur too minutely to contribute to the cumulative side-effects of nordazepam pro-drugs (except when they are abused chronically in extremely supra- therapeutic doses). Side effects Common side effects of nordazepam include somnolence, which is more common in elderly patients and/or people on high- dose regimens. Hypotonia, which is much less common, is also associated with high doses and/or old age. Contraindications and special caution Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. As with many other drugs, changes in liver function associated with aging or diseases such as cirrhosis, may lead to impaired clearance of nordazepam. Pharmacology Nordazepam is a partial agonist at the GABAA receptor, which makes it less potent than other benzodiazepines, particularly in its amnesic and muscle-relaxing effects. Its elimination half life is between 36 and 200 hours, with wide variation among individuals; factors such as age and gender are known to impact it. The variation of reported half-lifes are attributed to differences in nordazepam metabolism and that of its metabolites as nordazepam is hydroxylated to active metabolites such as oxazepam, before finally being glucuronidated and excreted in the urine. This can be attributed to extremely variable hepatic and renal metabolic functions among individuals depending upon a number of factors (including age, ethnicity, disease, and current or previous use/abuse of other drugs/medicines). Pregnancy and nursing mothers Nordazepam, like other benzodiazepines, easily crosses the placental barrier, so the drug should not be administered during the first trimester of pregnancy. In case of serious medical reasons, nordazepam can be given in late pregnancy, but the foetus, due to the pharmacological action of the drug, may experience side effects such as hypothermia, hypotonia, and sometimes mild respiratory depression. Since nordazepam and other benzodiazepines are excreted in breast milk, the substance should not be administered to mothers who are breastfeeding. Discontinuing of breast-feeding is indicated for regular intake by the mother. Recreational use Nordazepam and other sedative-hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting benzodiazepines are commonly used in doses higher than the recommended doses.

Hence this article refers to the sixth, seventh and eighth models of British BL 8-inch howitzers were a series of British artillery siege howitzers on mobile carriages of a new design introduced in World War I. They were designed by Vickers in Britain and produced by all four British artillery manufacturers, but mainly by Armstrong, and one American company. They were the equivalents of the German 21 cm Morser 16 and in British service were used similarly to the BL 9.2-inch howitzer, but were quicker to manufacture, and more mobile. They delivered a 200 lb shell to 12,300 yards. They had limited service in the British Army in World War II before being converted to the new 7.2-inch calibre. They also equipped a small number of Australian and Canadian batteries in World War I and by the US Army in that war. They were used in small numbers by other European armies. Design and variants Mk 6 has slid off-road behind Holt artillery tractor, WWI 8 inch was a calibre adopted in the First World War by the British Army.

It was 4‚Äì5 tonnes lighter than the improvised 8-inch \\"howitzers\\" Mks I ‚Äì V. The Mk VI barrel was of built-up construction and was 14.7 calibres (117.7 inches) long, with a range of 10,745 yards (9,825 m). =Mark VII= Introduced July 1916. Mk VII had a longer barrel (17.3 calibres, or 138.4 inches) of wire-wound construction and increased the range to 12,300 yards (11,250 m). The new barrels turned out to have short lives and suffered from cracked A tubes (the inner rifled layer of the built-up barrel). =Mark VIII= Mk 8 in WWI camouflage paint at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa Mk VIII incorporated various small improvements and a thicker and stronger barrel. Combat use =World War I= Gun on Vickers firing platform, and limber, gun and platform being towed Australian gun at full recoil after firing, Third Battle of Ypres, 15 September 1917 Early problems of stability on very hard or soft ground became apparent with the Mk VI, leading to the recoil system not functioning correctly. A Commission went to France to investigate, and a special level \\"Vickers platform\\" was adopted, to which the wheels and trail were secured for accurate shooting. A major change in the line of shooting required the platform to be relaid. Setting up and adjusting the platform was labour-intensive.Clarke 2005, page 46 The US manual describes it:Handbook of artillery. United States. Army.

In March 1940, 266 weapons were authorised for transfer from the United States to the British. After the Fall of France, the remaining guns were used for training only. In 1941 a further 168 weapons (the remaining US stock) were authorised for transfer to the British under Lend-Lease. The advent of the BL 7.2-inch howitzer meant that remaining 8-inch barrels were relined to 7.2 inch. With no guns left, they were declared obsolete by July 1943. Some Vickers 8-inch guns were present in Japanese island fortifications during the Pacific Campaign. Use by United States US gunners with Mk VI gun in France Versions of the Mk 6 were manufactured in the United States by Midvale Steel and Ordnance Co, Nicetown, Pennsylvania during World War I, initially supplied to Britain and then used to equip US forces when it entered the war. These were designated the M1917 in US service. A US Mk 7 and Mk version was also manufactured and adopted in US service from October 1918 as the M1918.Hartwell \\"8-inch British Howitzer\\" Quoting from the US Army manual of 1920 on artillery in US service:Handbook of Artillery, US Ordnance Dept, May 1920, pages 261, 263, 268 > \\"The 8-inch howitzer materiel is called the \\"Vickers\\" model of 1917, of > which there are in use two types, the Mark VI and Mark VII.

The 58th Regiment Coast Artillery Corps (C.A.C.) was in action in France in the final days of World War I with the US-manufactured Mk 6, and the 44th, 51st, and 59th Regiments were in action with British-manufactured versions. An additional six regiments, three with each type of gun, are described as being nearly ready for the front at the time of the Armistice.Hartwell \\"History of United States Army Coast Artillery Corps During World War One\\" Each regiment had an authorised strength of 24 guns. A total of at least 285 M1917 (Mark 6), 116 M1918 (Mark 7), and 61 M1918 (Mark ) weapons were acquired by the US Army, plus 16 for the US Marine Corps. 52 weapons were purchased from the British beginning in January 1918; subsequent inventory figures indicate they were in addition to these totals. By 1922 the 8-inch howitzers were withdrawn from active units and stored as war reserves. A 1926 inventory showed 508 howitzers and 646 carriages in Army hands. An approximate total of 530 howitzers were acquired. In 1933 some of the howitzers' Asbury breech mechanisms were used in developing the 155 mm gun T3, eventually the M1 \\"Long Tom\\". In 1934 the Marine Corps weapons were transferred to the Army. In March 1940 466 weapons were on hand; 266 of these were authorised for transfer to the British. A further 32 weapons were transferred to Finland in September 1940. In 1941 the remaining weapons were authorised for transfer to the British under Lend-Lease. None of these weapons were donated as war memorials, and none survive in the United States. Use by Finland Breech of No. 188 built by Midvale used by Finland During the Russo-Finnish Winter War, Finland found itself in dire need of heavy artillery. Thirty-two \\"8 in Howitzer Mk 7 (Vickers Mk 6)\\" 8-inch howitzers were bought from the United States in 1939 but arrived too late to see action in the war. The howitzers were given the designation 203 H 17 (203 mm, Haupitsi [Finnish for howitzer], 1917) and were first issued to three heavy artillery battalions (1st, 2nd and 3rd), which later were re-organised into six heavy artillery batteries (11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th). The howitzer was well-liked by the Finnish army for its durability. Thirteen of these howitzers were lost in the battles of the summer of 1944; eight of these belonged to Heavy Artillery Battery 4 and were lost at Valkeasaari on 10 June, while the other five belonged to Heavy Artillery Battery 3, located northeast of Lake Ladoga. The howitzers were stored after the war and were struck from the lists in the late 1960s.Paulaharju, p. 148 Operators * ‚Äì 6 pieces, 54th Siege Artillery Battery, Royal Australian Artillery * ‚Äì 32 artillery pieces, known as 203 H 17  ‚Äì Royal Garrison Artillery (amalgamated in 1924 into Royal Artillery) * ‚Äì (see History Of The Fifty- Eighth Artillery C.A.C.) * ‚Äì 72 howitzers Mk VI (203 mm howitzer Mk. 1916).

It is a cyclic ether and a monoterpenoid. Eucalyptol is also known by a variety of synonyms: 1,8-cineol, 1,8-cineole, cajeputol, 1,8-epoxy-p-menthane, 1,8-oxido- p-menthane, eucalyptol, eucalyptole, 1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, cineol, and cineole. In 1870, F. S. Cloez identified and ascribed the name \\"eucalyptol\\" to the dominant portion of Eucalyptus globulus oil. Composition Eucalyptol makes up 90% of eucalyptus oil. It is also found in Wormwood, rosemary, common sage, Cannabis sativa and other aromatic plants. Eucalyptol may be toxic if ingested. Properties Eucalyptol has a fresh mint-like smell and a spicy, cooling taste. It is insoluble in water, but miscible with ether, ethanol, and chloroform. The boiling point is 176¬∞C and the flash point is 49¬∞C. Eucalyptol forms crystalline adducts with hydrohalic acids, o-cresol, resorcinol, and phosphoric acid. Formation of these adducts is useful for purification. Uses =Flavoring and fragrance= Because of its pleasant, spicy aroma and taste, eucalyptol is used in flavorings, fragrances, and cosmetics. Cineole-based eucalyptus oil is used as a flavouring at low levels (0.002%) in various products, including baked goods, confectionery, meat products, and beverages. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, eucalyptol was listed as one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. It is claimed to be added to improve the flavor. Eucalyptol is an ingredient in commercial mouthwashes, and has been used in traditional medicine as a cough suppressant. =Insecticide and repellent= Eucalyptol is used as an insecticide and insect repellent. In contrast, eucalyptol is one of many compounds that are attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, which gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study. One such study with Euglossa imperialis, a nonsocial orchid bee species, has shown that the presence of cineole (also eucalyptol) elevates territorial behavior and specifically attracts the male bees. It was even observed that these males would periodically leave their territories to forage for chemicals such as cineole, thought to be important for attracting and mating with females, to synthesize pheromones. Toxicology In higher-than-normal doses, eucalyptol is hazardous via ingestion, skin contact, or inhalation. It can have acute health effects on behavior, the respiratory tract, and the nervous system. The acute oral is 2480 mg/kg (rat). It is classified as a reproductive toxin for females and a suspected reproductive toxin for males.  Pharmacodynamics  It is known that eucalyptol has anti-inflammatory properties and researchers have suggested these, and other effects such as soothing sensations, may be mediated by the ion channel TRPM8. The same channel is also activated by menthol.

Allan was a career sailor in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), serving from 1914 to 1947. Early life Allan was born in Bega in the then British colony of New South Wales, eighteen months before the Commonwealth of Australia came into being. Naval career He joined the RAN in March 1914 at the age of fourteen as an ordinary seaman second class. When war was declared on 14 August 1914, he was 15 and serving aboard the training ship , which was docked in Rose Bay, Sydney. He served on board until the end of the war, and became an able seaman in 1915. When he was eighteen, he survived the Spanish flu pandemic, which killed over fifty of his shipmates on a transport voyage between Cape Town and Sierra Leone. Between the world wars, Allan almost drowned after falling overboard in the North Atlantic ‚Äî and would have done so had his captain not braved the precipitous storm, turned the ship around, and rescued him with the help of a life preserver and a rope ladder. In 1932 he was promoted to chief petty officer. Allan went on to serve on in the Second World War, sailing in convoy with HM Ships and . He retired from the Navy on 30 October 1947, after serving thirty-four years, being granted his war service rank of lieutenant prior to discharge. He met his wife, Ita Blakely, while his ship was docked in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1924, and he continued to write to her until his ship returned to Vancouver in 1941. They married on that return trip and sailed to Australia as newlyweds on SS Mariposa via Hawaii ‚Äî only twelve days before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Later life Allan was awarded the 80th Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal by the Government of Australia in 1999, and lived in the Melbourne suburb of Essendon, Victoria until his death at the age of 106.

AAFM was superseded by the Global Academy of Finance & Management. History The AAFM was founded in 1996 through a merger of the American Academy of Financial Management & Analysts (AAFMA) and the Founders Advisory Committee of the Original Tax and Estate Planning Law Review. In January 2015, the AAFM sold its intellectual property to the Global Academy of Finance & Management - the logo for which is the same as that of the AAFM with different letters\\"Home\\" GAFM website - and the International Board of Certification Standards, which now awards the AAFM's certifications in the United States.\\"Press\\" GAFM website According to the GAFM website, George Mentz, the founder of the AAFM, is also the founder of GAFM/IBS brands.\\"Board\\" GAFM website In some other countries, such as India, a rump of the AAFM still operates.http://www.aafmindia.co.in/ Activities The AAFM offered multiple professional membership, certifications, and designations. Members had to have come through one of the AAFM-recognized university programs or through a government-recognized executive educational program, although the board waived these requirements in some cases. The AAFM board has never directly provided training, but has recognized hundreds of approved providers.http://aafm.us/ACBSP-Alliance- MentzLetter.pdf Certifications/designations The AAFM awarded a number of its own designations, including chartered asset manager (CAM), chartered market analyst (CMA), chartered portfolio manager (CPM), chartered trust and estate planner (CTEP), chartered wealth manager (CWM), and master financial professional (MFP). Some of these designations were available to anyone with an accredited degree or license in finance, investments, securities, economics, or accounting upon payment of a fee. CWM certification normally involved about 80 hours of online study, although holders of certain professional designations, such as a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) or Certified Public Accountant (CPA), needed only to take a test and pay a fee; and anyone with sufficient professional experience could skip the test and get the designation by only paying fees. Those with a degree that involved at least some business coursework could also take an AAFM certification course, pay a fee, and receive an MFP. Recognition According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) eight designations were \\"offered and recognized by the issuing organization\\" (i.e., AAFM).CAM ,RFS ,MFP ,CWM ,CTEP ,CMA ,CPM ,FAD FINRA does not state on these pages that they, or anyone else, recognises them. FINRA does state that it does not approve or endorse any professional credential or designation listed on its website. Criticism and evidence  In October 2010, The Wall Street Journal published an article detailing the use of questionable credentials by financial advisors that discussed the AAFM extensively.. The article noted that the AAFM included among its Global Board of Academic Advisors & Professors several individuals who had never given their permission to be listed as board members. The article criticized the practice of many standards boards, AAFM included, of awarding credentials without requiring applicants to undergo any sort of assessment or examination, quoting the AAFM's founder, George Mentz, as evidence of this practice. A claim on the AAFM website that it had a special affiliation with both the CFA Institute and the CFP Board, which administer Chartered Financial Analyst and Certified Financial Planner certificate programs, respectively, was rebutted by representatives of both organizations in the article. The CFP Board said that the AAFM had once helped provide continuing education for CFPs, but that it hasn't done so since 2006. Some of the individuals listed in a board of advisors told the WSJ they had no idea they were listed and hadn't agreed to it. The AAFM has countered that individuals listed on its board of advisors did consent to be listed, posting emails from two individuals on its website.. The organization also posted to its website part of the signature page of a document agreeing that the Association for Investment Management Research (the precursor to the CFA Institute) would not contest the AAFM's trademarks, with the signature itself blanked and replaced with the type-written statement, \\"Signed by Sharon Glover, who must have been Jeannie Andersons Boss at the time\\" [sic]..

It was the first ten-coupled steam locomotive in Great Britain.  Background  James Holden stands in front of his locomotive. The locomotive was built for purely political purposes in order to block the passage through Parliament of a new rival scheme for an electric railway. The Decapod was built in 1902 to a design by the GER Chief Draughtsman, Fred Russell under the supervision of the Chief Superintendent, James Holden. The aim was to demonstrate the ability of a steam locomotive to accelerate passenger trains at a rate comparable to electric traction and the electric trams with which the GER was also in competition over short distances. The locomotive was far larger than any locomotive previously built in Britain for home service. It had 10 driving wheels for maximum grip and prevention of wheelspin, each of which was four-foot-six-inches in diameter which gave high tractive effort. Three cylinders were used because there was insufficient room for two cylinders large enough to develop the required tractive effort without going up to a higher boiler pressure. Even so, it still had to have a pressure of 200 psi (1,380 kPa) to achieve the required result.  Technical details  The engine was fitted with a large Wootten firebox. There were three separate grates and ash pans, one on each side outside the frames and a third between, giving an aggregate area of . The trailing drivers were given a side play of , the coupling rods being fitted with ball and socket joints. As the cranks of the three cylinders were set at 120 degrees in relation to each other, perfect balancing of the reciprocating parts was secured. In order to minimise the drivers slipping, compressed air sanders were fitted.  Performance  The specification required that the locomotive should accelerate a train from a stand to in 30 seconds, an acceleration of 1.46 feet per second per second. According to Ahrons, \\"Holden's engine actually accelerated a new train of eighteen coaches, weighing 335 tons, at a rate of 1.4ft. per second per second in very windy weather.\\" Axle load at 16.75 tons (17 tonnes) was not excessive, but weight per foot run of wheelbase was very high and using a class of these engines would have necessitated considerable strengthening of bridges. Thus whilst it achieved its design aims, nothing resulted from the experiment. Rebuilt As the locomotive was therefore surplus to requirements, it was rebuilt in 1906, and converted into an 0-8-0 freight tender engine. The rebuild included a new boiler with a Belpaire firebox and a standard GE high- sided goods locomotive tender. Number 20 was then assigned to March district for hauling coal trains, but proved no more capable than the Class G58 locomotives. The design was therefore not repeated, and the locomotive remained the only eight-coupled engine of the GER. It was scrapped in 1913 as nonstandard after a short working life.  0-10-0 developments  The Midland Railway produced the second 0-10-0 locomotive in 1919 with its MR 0-10-0 Lickey Banker. The third ten-coupled engine however would not appear until 1943 in the guise of a class of 2-10-0s built by the War Department, the Austerity 2-10-0. These were followed in 1954 by the last class of British ten-coupled engines, the BR standard class 9F. Fiction In the 2017 film, Thomas & Friends: Journey Beyond Sodor, a character named Hurricane is based on this engine before it was rebuilt.

More specifically, it is a model for the behavior of a large set of coupled oscillators. Its formulation was motivated by the behavior of systems of chemical and biological oscillators, and it has found widespread applications such as in neuroscience and oscillating flame dynamics. Kuramoto was quite surprised when the behavior of some physical systems, namely coupled arrays of Josephson junctions, followed his model.Steven Strogatz, Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Hyperion, 2003. The model makes several assumptions, including that there is weak coupling, that the oscillators are identical or nearly identical, and that interactions depend sinusoidally on the phase difference between each pair of objects.  Definition  upright=1.1 In the most popular version of the Kuramoto model, each of the oscillators is considered to have its own intrinsic natural frequency \\\\omega_i, and each is coupled equally to all other oscillators. Surprisingly, this fully nonlinear model can be solved exactly in the limit of infinite oscillators, N‚Üí ‚àû; alternatively, using self-consistency arguments one may obtain steady-state solutions of the order parameter. The most popular form of the model has the following governing equations: : \\\\frac{d \\\\theta_i}{d t} = \\\\omega_i + \\\\frac{K}{N} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\\\sin(\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i), \\\\qquad i = 1 \\\\ldots N, where the system is composed of N limit-cycle oscillators, with phases \\\\theta_i and coupling constant K. Noise can be added to the system. In that case, the original equation is altered to: : \\\\frac{d \\\\theta_i}{d t} = \\\\omega_{i}+\\\\zeta_{i}+\\\\dfrac{K}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N\\\\sin(\\\\theta_{j}-\\\\theta_{i}) , where \\\\zeta_{i} is the fluctuation and a function of time. If we consider the noise to be white noise, then: : \\\\langle\\\\zeta_{i}(t)\\\\rangle=0 , : \\\\langle\\\\zeta_{i}(t)\\\\zeta_{j}(t')\\\\rangle=2D\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\delta(t-t') with D denoting the strength of noise.  Transformation  The transformation that allows this model to be solved exactly (at least in the N ‚Üí ‚àû limit) is as follows: Define the \\"order\\" parameters r and œà as :re^{i \\\\psi} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{i \\\\theta_j} . Here r represents the phase-coherence of the population of oscillators and œà indicates the average phase. Multiplying this equation with e^{-i \\\\theta_i} and only considering the imaginary part gives: : \\\\frac{d \\\\theta_i}{d t} = \\\\omega_i + K r \\\\sin(\\\\psi-\\\\theta_i) . Thus the oscillators' equations are no longer explicitly coupled; instead the order parameters govern the behavior. A further transformation is usually done, to a rotating frame in which the statistical average of phases over all oscillators is zero (i.e. \\\\psi=0). Finally, the governing equation becomes: : \\\\frac{d \\\\theta_i}{d t} = \\\\omega_i - K r \\\\sin(\\\\theta_i) .  Large N limit  Now consider the case as N tends to infinity. Take the distribution of intrinsic natural frequencies as g(œâ) (assumed normalized). Then assume that the density of oscillators at a given phase Œ∏, with given natural frequency œâ, at time t is \\\\rho(\\\\theta, \\\\omega, t). Normalization requires that : \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} \\\\rho(\\\\theta, \\\\omega, t) \\\\, d \\\\theta = 1. The continuity equation for oscillator density will be : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}[\\\\rho v] = 0, where v is the drift velocity of the oscillators given by taking the infinite-N limit in the transformed governing equation, such that : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}[\\\\rho \\\\omega + \\\\rho K r \\\\sin(\\\\psi-\\\\theta)] = 0. Finally, we must rewrite the definition of the order parameters for the continuum (infinite N) limit. \\\\theta_i must be replaced by its ensemble average (over all \\\\omega) and the sum must be replaced by an integral, to give : r e^{i \\\\psi} = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} e^{i \\\\theta} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\rho(\\\\theta, \\\\omega, t) g(\\\\omega) \\\\, d \\\\omega \\\\, d \\\\theta.  Solutions  The incoherent state with all oscillators drifting randomly corresponds to the solution \\\\rho = 1/(2\\\\pi). In that case r = 0, and there is no coherence among the oscillators. They are uniformly distributed across all possible phases, and the population is in a statistical steady-state (although individual oscillators continue to change phase in accordance with their intrinsic œâ). When coupling K is sufficiently strong, a fully synchronized solution is possible. In the fully synchronized state, all the oscillators share a common frequency, although their phases can be different. A solution for the case of partial synchronization yields a state in which only some oscillators (those near the ensemble's mean natural frequency) synchronize; other oscillators drift incoherently. Mathematically, the state has :\\\\rho = \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\theta - \\\\psi - \\\\arcsin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{K r}\\\\right)\\\\right) for locked oscillators, and :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\rm{normalization \\\\; constant}}{(\\\\omega - K r \\\\sin(\\\\theta - \\\\psi))} for drifting oscillators. The cutoff occurs when \\\\omega < K r .  Connection to Hamiltonian systems  The dissipative Kuramoto model is contained in certain conservative Hamiltonian systems with Hamiltonian of the form: : \\\\mathcal{H}(q_1,\\\\ldots, q_N, p_1, \\\\ldots, p_N) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\\\frac{\\\\omega_i}{2} (q_i^2 + p_i^2) + \\\\frac{K}{4N} \\\\sum_{i,j = 1}^{N} (q_i p_j - q_j p_i) ( q_j^2 + p_j^2 - q_i^2 - p_i^2 ) After a canonical transformation to action-angle variables with actions I_i = \\\\left( q_i^2 + p_i^2 \\\\right)/2 and angles (phases) \\\\phi_i = \\\\mathrm{arctan2} \\\\left( q_i/p_i \\\\right) , exact Kuramoto dynamics emerges on invariant manifolds of constant I_i \\\\equiv I . With the transformed Hamiltonian: : \\\\mathcal{H'}(I_1, \\\\ldots I_N, \\\\phi_1 \\\\ldots, \\\\phi_N) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\\\omega_i I_i \\\\- \\\\frac{K}{N} \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} \\\\sum_{j = 1}^{N} \\\\sqrt{I_j I_i} (I_j - I_i) \\\\sin(\\\\phi_j - \\\\phi_i), Hamilton's equation of motion become: : \\\\frac{d I_i}{dt} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{H}'}{\\\\partial \\\\phi_i} = - \\\\frac{2 K}{N} \\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\sqrt{I_k I_i} (I_k - I_i) \\\\cos(\\\\phi_k - \\\\phi_i) and : \\\\frac{d \\\\phi_i}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{H}'}{\\\\partial I_i} = \\\\omega_i + \\\\frac{K}{N} \\\\sum_{k=1}^N \\\\left[ 2 \\\\sqrt{I_i I_k} \\\\sin(\\\\phi_k - \\\\phi_i) \\\\right. \\\\left. + \\\\sqrt{I_k/I_i} (I_k - I_i) \\\\sin(\\\\phi_k - \\\\phi_i) \\\\right] . So the manifold with I_j = I is invariant because \\\\frac{d I_i}{dt} = 0 and the phase dynamics \\\\frac{d \\\\phi_i}{dt} becomes the dynamics of the Kuramoto model (with the same coupling constants for I = 1/2 ). The class of Hamiltonian systems characterizes certain quantum-classical systems including Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates.  Variations of the models  Distinct synchronization patterns in a two-dimensional array of Kuramoto-like oscillators with differing phase interaction functions and spatial coupling topologies. (A) Pinwheels. (B) Waves. (C) Chimeras. (D) Chimeras and waves combined. Color scale indicates oscillator phase. There are a number of types of variations that can be applied to the original model presented above. Some models change to topological structure, others allow for heterogeneous weights, and other changes are more related to models that are inspired by the Kuramoto model but do not have the same functional form. = Variations of network topology = Beside the original model, which has an all-to-all topology, a sufficiently dense complex network-like topology is amenable to the mean-field treatment used in the solution of the original model (see Transformation and Large N limit above for more info). Network topologies such as rings and coupled populations support chimera states. One also may ask for the behavior of models in which there are intrinsically local, like one-dimensional topologies which the chain and the ring are prototypical examples. In such topologies, in which the coupling is not scalable according to 1/N, it is not possible to apply the canonical mean-field approach, so one must rely upon case-by-case analysis, making use of symmetries whenever it is possible, which may give basis for abstraction of general principles of solutions. Uniform synchrony, waves and spirals can readily be observed in two-dimensional Kuramoto networks with diffusive local coupling. The stability of waves in these models can be determined analytically using the methods of Turing stability analysis. Uniform synchrony tends to be stable when the local coupling is everywhere positive whereas waves arise when the long-range connections are negative (inhibitory surround coupling). Waves and synchrony are connected by a topologically distinct branch of solutions known as ripple. These are low- amplitude spatially-periodic deviations that emerge from the uniform state (or the wave state) via a Hopf bifurcation. The existence of ripple solutions was predicted (but not observed) by Wiley, Strogatz and Girvan, who called them multi-twisted q-states. The topology on which the Kuramoto model is studied can be made adaptive by use of fitness model showing enhancement of synchronization and percolation in a self-organised way. = Variations of network topology and network weights: from vehicle coordination to brain synchronization = Metronomes, initially out of phase, synchronize through small motions of the base on which they are placed. This system has been shown to be equivalent to the Kuramoto model. Some works in the control community have focused on the Kuramoto model on networks and with heterogeneous weights (i.e. the interconnection strength between any two oscillators can be arbitrary). The dynamics of this model reads as follows: : \\\\frac{d \\\\theta_i}{d t} = \\\\omega_i + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij} \\\\sin(\\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i), \\\\qquad i = 1 \\\\ldots N where a_{ij} is a nonzero positive real number if oscillator j is connected to oscillator i. Such model allows for a more realistic study of, e.g., flocking, schooling, and vehicle coordination. In the work from D√∂rfler and colleagues, several theorems provide rigorous conditions for phase and frequency synchronization of this model. Further studies, motivated by experimental observations in neuroscience, focus on deriving analytical conditions for cluster synchronization of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillators on arbitrary network topologies. Since the Kuramoto model seems to play a key role in assessing synchronization phenomena in the brain, theoretical conditions that support empirical findings may pave the way for a deeper understanding of neuronal synchronization phenomena. = Variations of the phase interaction function = Kuramoto approximated the phase interaction between any two oscillators by its first Fourier component, namely \\\\Gamma(\\\\phi) = \\\\sin(\\\\phi), where \\\\phi = \\\\theta_j - \\\\theta_i. Better approximations can be obtained by including higher-order Fourier components, :\\\\Gamma(\\\\phi) = \\\\sin(\\\\phi) + a_1 \\\\sin(2\\\\phi + b_1) + ... + a_n \\\\sin(2n\\\\phi + b_n), where parameters a_i and b_i must be estimated. For example, synchronization among a network of weakly-coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons can be replicated using coupled oscillators that retain the first four Fourier components of the interaction function. The introduction of higher-order phase interaction terms can also induce interesting dynamical phenomena such as partially synchronized states, heteroclinic cycles, and chaotic dynamics.

Today, the Katedralskole serves as secondary school. Cathedral schools began in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education, some of them ultimately evolving into medieval universities. Throughout the Middle Ages and beyond, they were complemented by the monastic schools. Some of these early cathedral schools, and more recent foundations, continued into modern times. Early schools Philosopher on one of the archivolts over the right door of the west portal at Chartres Cathedral In the later Roman Empire, as Roman municipal education declined, bishops began to establish schools associated with their cathedrals to provide the church with an educated clergy. The earliest evidence of a school established in this manner is in Visigothic Spain at the Second Council of Toledo in 527. These early schools, with a focus on an apprenticeship in religious learning under a scholarly bishop, have been identified in other parts of Spain and in about twenty towns in Gaul (France) during the sixth and seventh centuries. During and after the mission of St Augustine to England, cathedral schools were established as the new dioceses were themselves created (Canterbury 597, Rochester 604, York 627 for example). This group of schools forms the oldest schools continuously operating. A significant function of cathedral schools was to provide boy trebles for the choirs, evolving into choir schools, some of which still function as such. Charlemagne, king of the Franks and later Emperor, recognizing the importance of education to the clergy and, to a lesser extent, to the nobility, set out to restore this declining tradition by issuing several decrees requiring that education be provided at monasteries and cathedrals. In 789, Charlemagne's Admonitio Generalis required that schools be established in every monastery and bishopric, in which \\"children can learn to read; that psalms, notation, chant, computation, and grammar be taught.\\"Pierre Rich√©, Daily Life in the World of Charlemagne, Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1988, p. 191. Subsequent documents, such as the letter De litteris colendis, required that bishops select as teachers men who had \\"the will and the ability to learn and a desire to instruct others\\"Charlemagne: \\"De Litteris Colendis\\" and a decree of the Council of Frankfurt (794) recommended that bishops undertake the instruction of their clergy.Pierre Rich√©, Daily Life in the World of Charlemagne, Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1988, pp. 192. Subsequently, cathedral schools arose in major cities such as Chartres, Orleans, Paris, Laon, Reims or Rouen in France and Utrecht, Liege, Cologne, Metz, Speyer, W√ºrzburg, Bamberg, Magdeburg, Hildesheim or Freising in Germany. Following in the earlier tradition, these cathedral schools primarily taught future clergy and provided literate administrators for the increasingly elaborate courts of the Renaissance of the 12th century. Speyer was renowned for supplying the Holy Roman Empire with diplomats.Geschichte der Stadt Speyer. Vol 1, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart 1982, The court of Henry I of England, himself an early example of a literate king, was closely tied to the cathedral school of Laon.C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (Yale English Monarchs), 2001 p. 25. =Characteristics and development= Cathedral schools were mostly oriented around the academic welfare of the nobility's children. Because it was intended to train them for careers in the church, girls were excluded from the schools. Later on, many lay students who were not necessarily interested in seeking a career in the church wanted to enroll. Demand arose for schools to teach government, state, and other Church affairs. The schools, (some notable ones dating back to the eighth and ninth centuries) accepted fewer than 100 students. Pupils had to demonstrate substantial intelligence and be able to handle a demanding academic course load. Considering that books were also expensive, students were in the practice of memorizing their teachers' lectures. Cathedral schools at this time were primarily run by a group of ministers and divided into two parts: Schola minor which was intended for younger students would later become elementary schools. Then there was the schola major, which taught older students. These would later become secondary schools. The subjects taught at cathedral schools ranged from literature to mathematics. These topics were called the seven liberal arts: grammar, astronomy, rhetoric (or speech), logic, arithmetic, geometry and music. In grammar classes, students were trained to read, write and speak Latin which was the universal language in Europe at the time. Astronomy was necessary for calculating dates and times. Rhetoric was a major component of a vocal education. Logic consisted of the criteria for sound or fallacious arguments, particularly in a theological context, and arithmetic served as the basis for quantitative reasoning. Students read stories and poems in Latin by authors such as Cicero and Virgil. Much as in the present day, cathedral schools were split into elementary and higher schools with different curricula. The elementary school curriculum was composed of reading, writing and psalmody, while the high school curriculum was trivium (grammar, rhetoric and dialect), the rest of the liberal arts, as well as scripture study and pastoral theology.  Cathedral schools today  While cathedral schools are no longer a significant site of higher education, many Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran cathedrals operate as primary or secondary schools.

Actimel earned over ‚Ç¨1.4 billion (US$1.8 billion) in retail sales in 2006.  History  Actimel was invented in the 1980s when the first steps to developing a fermented milk based on Lactobacillus casei Danone were taken. But it wasn‚Äôt until 1994 when it was commercially-launched in Belgium. The word Actimel is derived from the Flemish ‚ÄúActive melk‚Äù which translates simply as Active Milk.  Scientific basis  Claimed benefits range from reducing the incidence of diarrhea and rhinitis reduction for young children, to improvement of the immune function in adults and seniors and reduction of duration of winter infections for elderly. A 2007 study published by the British Medical JournalUse of probiotic Lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial - Hickson et al., 10.1136/bmj.39231.599815.55 - BMJ suggests that the product could help avoid antibiotic‚Äìassociated diarrhoea and limit Clostridium difficile colitis infections in elderly patients. Debates surrounding health claims on probiotic foods On 23 January 2008, a proposed class action was filed in California, accusing Danone Co. Inc. of false advertising in their marketing of yogurt containing probiotic bacteria (Danactive & Activia), alleging that the claimed health benefits have never been proven. The company has denied this accusation. Foodwatch claims that Danone \\"makes a mountain out of a molehill\\" in suggesting that Actimel protects from cold and boosts health. Foodwatch believes that the company sells a commodity product as a niche product using branding. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is an independent regulator for advertisements, sales promotion and direct marketing in the UK. According to Spiegel Online one TV spot from Actimel was blocked by the ASA in 2006 and one in 2008.Amann, Susanne: Marketing-Erfolg. Mit Joghurt Millionen scheffeln. Spiegel Online 22.12.2008 http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-597184,00.html In the first case the ASA upheld a complaint that the advert misleadingly implied that children given Actimel would be prevented from catching bacterial infections.ASA adjudication 1 November 2006 Meanwhile in the second case complaints about the use of the phrase \\"Actimel is scientifically proven and you can see that proof for yourself on our website\\" were upheld as only summaries of, or references to, these studies were present on the website and the full content was not available.ASA adjudication 12 March 2008 A TV advert which stated that Actimel was \\"scientifically-proven to help support your kids' defences\\" was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.BBC 'Healthy' yogurt advert banned 13 October 2009 Alexa Meyer, from the Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Vienna, Austria, comparing probiotic drinks and normal yogurt, found no significant difference in the effect of Actimel and normal yogurt with living bacteria. The nutritional researcher recommends getting enough sleep, washing hands often and eating a daily bowl of yogurt. She says this would activate more active germ-fighting white blood cells, enhancing the immune system, probably due to the presence of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, from any normal yogurt, which is half the price of Actimel. The equivalence of yogurts is supported by Berthold Koletzko from the University of Munich, Metabolic Diseases and Nutrition, Munich, Germany in case of diarrhoea advises parents to give their children yogurt with living bacteria. It does not necessarily need to be Actimel, but may also be other yogurts. A measurable health benefit linked to the presence of live Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. Bulgaricus in yogurt was reported by Koletzko and colleagues in 2005. In this review Koletzko and colleagues say that it was clearly demonstrated that yogurt containing viable bacteria improves lactose digestion and eliminates symptoms of lactose intolerance, and clearly fulfill the current concept of probiotics. The net \\"all-cause\\" effects of yogurts have also been questioned; its 6 September 2009 issue, Nature featured an article by Didier Raoult who claimed that \\"probiotic-enriched\\" yogurt beverages may have contributed to the increase in obesity over the past 20 years. Within the 27 countries of the European Union, a new health claims regulation was put in place by the European Commission as of 1 July 2007. In Canada, a similar regulation is currently in the works at Health Canada.Managing Health Claims for Foods in Canada: Towards a Modernized Framework  References  External links *Actimel website Brand name yogurts Groupe Danone brands ","title":"Actimel"},{"id":"2938712","text":"In Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul. This quality, however, is subdued by the soul's association with karmic matter. All souls who have achieved the natural state of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge (kevala jnana), infinite power and infinite perception are regarded as God in Jainism. Jainism rejects the idea of a creator deity responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have always existed. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and perfect soul, an immaterial entity cannot create or affect a material entity like the universe.The Perfect Law Jainworld.org  Definition  From the essential perspective, the soul of every living organism is perfect in every way, is independent of any actions of the organism, and is considered God or to have godliness. But the epithet of God is given to the soul in whom its properties manifest in accordance with its inherent nature. There are countably infinite souls in the universe. According to Ratnakaranda ≈õrƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅra (a major Jain text): :‡§Ü‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§®‡•ã ‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§ø‡§®‡§¶‡•ã‡§∑‡•á‡§£ ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•á‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§Æ‡•á‡§∂‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡•§ :‡§≠‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•á‡§® ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡§æ ‡§≠‡§µ‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡•§‡•§‡•´‡•§ :In the nature of things the true God should be free from the faults and weaknesses of the lower nature; [he should be] the knower of all things and the revealer of dharma; in no other way can divinity be constituted. :‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡§ø‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ú‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§ï‡•ç‡§° ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡§≠‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É‡•§ :‡§® ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ó‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§∑‡§Æ‡•ã‡§π‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡§∏ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡•§‡•§‡•¨‡•§‡•§ :He alone who is free from hunger, thirst, senility, disease, birth, death, fear, pride, attachment, aversion, infatuation, worry, conceit, hatred, uneasiness, sweat, sleep and surprise is called a God.  Godliness  In Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul (or every living organism) characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, Kevala Jnana (pure infinite knowledge), infinite perception, and perfect manifestations of (countably) infinite other attributes. There are two possible views after this point. One is to look at the soul from the perspective of the soul itself. This entails explanations of the properties of the soul, its exact structure, composition and nature, the nature of various states that arise from it and their source attributes as is done in the deep and arcane texts of SamayasƒÅra, Niyamasara and Pravachanasara. Another view is to consider things apart from the soul and its relationships with the soul. According to this view, the qualities of a soul are subdued due to karmas of the soul. Karmas are the fundamental particles of nature in Jainism. One who achieves this state of soul through right belief, right knowledge and right conduct can be termed a god. This perfection of soul is called Kevalin. A god thus becomes a liberated soul ‚Äì liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, karmas and finally liberated of body as well. This is called nirvana or moksha. Jainism does not teach the dependency on any supreme being for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos; a self- regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is regarded as observing the Mahavrata (\\"Great Vows\\"). Gods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as arihantas and non-embodied formless gods who are called Siddhas. Jainism considers the devƒ´s and devas to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve moksha. Thus, there are infinite gods in Jainism, all equivalent, liberated, and infinite in the manifestation of all attributes. The Self and karmas are separate substances in Jainism, the former living and the latter non-living. The attainment of enlightenment and the one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods. Therefore, beings (Arihant) who've attained omniscience (kevala jnana) are worshipped as gods. The quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them. Jainism is sometimes regarded as a transtheistic religion, though it can be atheistic or polytheistic based on the way one defines \\"God\\".  Five supreme beings  Stella depicting Pa√±ca-Parame·π£·π≠hi (five supreme beings) worthy of veneration as per Jainism In Jainism, the Pa√±ca-Parame·π£·π≠hi (Sanskrit for \\"five supreme beings\\") are a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The five supreme beings are: # Arihant # Siddha # Acharya (Head of the monastic order) # Upadhyaya (\\"Preceptor of less advanced ascetics\\") # Muni or Jain monks  Arihant  A human being who conquers all inner passions and possesses infinite right knowledge (Kevala Jnana) is revered as an arihant in Jainism. They are also called Jinas (conquerors) or Kevalin (omniscient beings). An arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence is able to destroy the four ghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas and attain kevala j√±ƒÅna, or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four aghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas. Arihantas, at the end of their human life-span, destroy all remaining aghƒÅtiyƒÅ karmas and attain Siddhahood. There are two kinds of kevalin or arihant: * SƒÅmƒÅnya Kevalin‚ÄìOrdinary victors, who are concerned with their own salvation. * Tirthankara Kevalin‚ÄìTwenty-four human spiritual guides (teaching gods), who show the true path to salvation.  Tƒ´rtha·πÖkara  Image of Vardhamana Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara (Photo:Samanar Hills) The word Tƒ´rtha·πÖkara signifies the founder of a tirtha which means a fordable passage across a sea. The Tirthankara show the \\"fordable path\\" across the sea of interminable births and deaths. Jain philosophy divides the wheel of time in two halves, Utsarpi·πáƒ´ or ascending time cycle and avasarpi·πáƒ´, the descending time cycle. Exactly 24 Tirthankara are said to grace each half of the cosmic time cycle. Rishabhanatha was the first Tirthankara and Mahavira was the last Tirthankara of avasarpi·πáƒ´. Tirthankara revive the fourfold order of Shraman, Shramani, ≈örƒÅvaka, and ≈örƒÅvika called sangha. Tirthankara can be called teaching gods who teach the Jain philosophy. However it would be a mistake to regard the tirthankara as gods analogous to the gods of the Hindu pantheon despite the superficial resemblances between Jain and Hindu ways of worship.Thrower (1980), p.93 Tirthankara, being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are not the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers. Tirthamkara-nama-karma is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a tirthankara.  Siddhas  Although the siddhas (the liberated beings) are formless and without a body, this is how the Jain temples often depict them. Ultimately all arihantas become siddhas, or liberated souls, at the time of their nirvana. A siddha is a soul who is permanently liberated from the transmigratory cycle of birth and death. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the Karmas and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in Siddhashila (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy. The Acharanga Sutra 1.197 describes siddhas in this way: Siddhashila as per the Jain cosmology Siddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls. There are infinite souls who have become siddhas and infinite more who will attain this state of liberation. According to Jainism, Godhood is not a monopoly of some omnipotent and powerful being(s). All souls, with right perception, knowledge and conduct can achieve self-realisation and attain this state. Once achieving this state of infinite bliss and having destroyed all desires, the soul is not concerned with worldly matters and does not interfere in the working of the universe, as any activity or desire to interfere will once again result in influx of karmas and thus loss of liberation. Jains pray to these passionless Gods not for any favors or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the God with the objective of destroying the karmas and achieving the Godhood. This is best understood by the term vandetadgunalabhdhaye ‚Äì i.e. \\"we pray to the attributes of such Gods to acquire such attributes\\" Nayanar (2005b), p.35 GƒÅthƒÅ 1.29 According to Anne Vallely:  Devas  PadmƒÅvatƒ´ devƒ´, ≈õƒÅsanadevƒ´ of Lord Parshvanatha at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddess amongst the Jains. According to Digambar Terapanth, worship of such deities is considered as mithyƒÅtva or wrong belief. However, in the Bispanthi Digambar tradition and the Shwetambar tradition, Padmavati is a popular Jain goddess. Jain cosmology offers an elaborate description of heavenly beings (devas), but these beings are neither viewed as creators nor are they immortal; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die. In this way, they are similar to the devas of Buddhism. English-language material tends to retain the term \\"deva\\" or describe these beings as \\"deities\\", \\"gods\\" and \\"goddesses.\\" Jainism describes existence of ≈õƒÅsanadevatƒÅs and ≈õƒÅsanadevƒ´s, the attendants of a Tirthankara, who create the samavasarana or the divine preaching assembly of a Tirthankara. Such heavenly beings are classified as:- * Bhavanapatis ‚Äì Devas dwelling in abodes * Vyantaras ‚Äì Intermediary devas * Jyoti·π£kas ‚Äì Luminaries * VaimƒÅnikas ‚Äì Astral devas The souls on account of accumulation of meritorious karmas reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit karmas are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship. ƒÄcƒÅrya Hemachandra decries the worship of such devas: Worship of such devas is considered as mithyatva or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas. Jain opposition to creationism Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of the universe. Further, it asserts that no god is responsible or causal for actions in the life of any living organism. ƒÄcƒÅrya Hemacandra in the 12th century put forth the Jain view of the universe in the Yoga≈õƒÅstra: Besides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to syllogism and deductive reasoning to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the Vedics, samkhyas, mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅs, Buddhists and other schools of thought were analyzed, debated and repudiated by various Jain ƒÄcƒÅryas. However, the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by ƒÄcƒÅrya Jinasena in MahƒÅpurƒÅna,Afterword on Jinasena, D.

She was built in the United Kingdom because such ships could not yet be constructed in Japan. The ship participated in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95 where she was damaged during the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894 and participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895. She collided with two Japanese ships during a storm and sank in 1897. She was refloated the following year and repaired. Fus≈ç played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905 and was reclassified as a coast defense ship after the war. She was struck from the Navy List in 1908 and sold for scrap the following year. Background Tensions between Japan and China heightened after the former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation of the murder of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines. China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain. The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan. The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¬•3.9‚Äì4.2 million to purchase three warships from abroad.Lengerer, Pt. I, pp. 40‚Äì41 No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain.Evans & Peattie, pp. 13‚Äì14 This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¬•2.3 million was approved later that month. Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard. No response was made by the Prime Minister's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships, one iron-hulled armored warship and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed, formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy. Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost. The Prime Minister's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul, Ueno Kagenori, that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed.Lengerer, Pt. I, pp. 41‚Äì42 Commander Matsumura Junz≈ç arrived in London on 21 July and gave Reed the specifications for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an proposal that exceeded the amount allocated in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this issue because Reed was scheduled to depart for a trip to Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to ¬£433,850 or ¬•2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of ¬£24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.Lengerer, Pt. I, pp. 43‚Äì46 Description The design of Fus≈ç was based on a scaled-down version of HMS Iron Duke, an Audacious-class central-battery ironclad, familiar to the Japanese as the flagship of the Royal Navy China Station from 1871‚Äì75.Japanese Ironclads Fuso and Hiei, p. 201 The ship was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 13 She had a forward draft of and drew aft.Japanese Ironclads Fuso and Hiei, p. 202 She displaced and had a crew of 26 officers and 269 enlisted men.Lengerer, Pt. III, p. 50 =Propulsion= Fus≈ç had a pair of two-cylinder, double-expansion trunk steam engines made by John Penn and Sons, each driving a two-bladed propeller. Eight cylindrical boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of . The engines were designed to produce to give the ships a speed of .Lengerer, Pt. II, p. 41 During her sea trials on 3 January 1878, she reached a maximum speed of from .Lengerer, Pt. I, p. 48 The ship carried a maximum of of coal, enough to steam at . The three-masted ironclad was barque-rigged and had a sail area of . To reduce wind resistance while under sail alone, the funnel was semi- retractable.Lengerer, Pt. II, p. 35 The ship was modernized at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal beginning in 1891. Her masts were removed and the fore- and mizzenmasts were replaced by two military masts also fitted with fighting tops. Her funnel was fixed in height and she received four new cylindrical boilers. To offset the reduced number of boilers, the new ones were fitted with forced draught which increased their working pressure to . The space made available by removal of the boilers was used to increase her coal storage by .Lengerer, Pt. II, pp. 35, 43 =Armament and armor= Fus≈ç was fitted with four 20-caliber Krupp rifled breech-loading (RBL) guns and two 22-caliber RBL Krupp guns. The 24 cm guns were mounted at the corners of the armored citadel on the main deck at an angle of 65 degrees to the centerline of the ship. Each gun could traverse 35 degrees to the left and right. Only the 60-degree arc at the bow and stern could not be fired upon. The two pivot-mounted 17-centimeter guns were positioned on the sides of the upper deck, each with three gun ports that allowed them to act as chase guns, firing fore and aft, as well as on the broadside. The ship also carried four long and two short guns, the latter intended for use ashore or mounted on the ship's boats.Lengerer, Pt. II, pp. 33‚Äì34 The armor-piercing shell of the 24-centimeter gun weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate of wrought iron armor at the muzzle. The 17-centimeter shell had a muzzle velocity of and could penetrate of armor. The only data available for the 75-millimeter guns is their muzzle velocities of and for the long and short-barreled guns respectively.Lengerer, Pt. II, p. 39 During the 1880s the armament of Fus≈ç was augmented several times. In June 1883 seven quadruple-barreled Nordenfelt machine guns were added for defense against torpedo boats. Five were positioned on the upper deck and one each in the fighting tops. Three years later two quintuple-barreled Nordenfeldt machine guns were mounted in the fighting tops. Slightly earlier, Fus≈ç became the first ship in the IJN to mount torpedo tubes for Schwartzkopff torpedoes when two above-water, traverseable tubes, one on each broadside, were added in late 1885. She first fired these weapons on 14 January 1886 although further testing revealed that the torpedoes were often damaged by the impact with the water. Upon the recommendation of the prominent French naval architect Louis-√âmile Bertin, a \\"spoon\\" was added to the ends of the tubes to make the torpedoes strike the water horizontally which better distributed the shock of impact. The modifications were made and successful tests were conducted before the end of the year.Lengerer, Pt. II, pp. 34‚Äì35 When the ship was being refitted from 1891‚Äì94, her anti-torpedo boat armament was reinforced by the replacement of three 25.4-millimeter Nordenfelt guns by a pair of 2.5-pounder Hotchkiss guns and a single 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun. Two additional 11-millimeter Nordenfelt guns in the fighting tops were also added at that time. After the Sino- Japanese War, a small poop deck was added in 1896 and a quick-firing (QF) gun was mounted there as the stern chase gun. Another such gun was mounted on the forecastle as the forward chase gun and the two 17-centimeter guns were replaced by another pair of 12-centimeter quick-firers. In addition twelve 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were added and the 11-millimeter guns were replaced by 25.4-millimeter Nordenfelts. In March 1900 the 12-centimeter chase guns were superseded by two QF guns and the former chase guns were shifted to make room for them. The final change to Fus≈çs armament was made in July 1906 when her obsolete 24-centimeter guns were replaced by two QF 15-centimeter guns and two more 3-pounders were added.Lengerer, Pt. II, pp. 35‚Äì38 Fus≈ç had a wrought- iron waterline armor belt thick amidships that tapered to at the ends of the ship. The sides of the central battery were 9 inches thick and the transverse bulkheads were thick. Construction and career Given a classical name for Japan,Silverstone, p. 328 Fus≈ç was built at the Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kong≈çs keel-laying as 24 September 1875--the same as that for the awarding of the contract--but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fus≈ç was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel.Lengerer, Pt. I, pp. 43, 46‚Äì47 Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. Beginning on 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.Lengerer, Pt. I, pp. 49‚Äì52 Fus≈ç was assigned to the Tokai Naval District and the Standing Fleet in 1880. That same year she transported the Naval Lord, Enomoto Takeaki, on a tour of Hokkaido. On 10 August 1881 she departed with Emperor Meiji on a tour of Aomori Prefecture and Otaru, Hokkaido that lasted until 30 September. The ship was transferred to the Medium Fleet in 1882 and made port visits in Kyushu and Pusan, Korea the following year. Fus≈ç visited Hong Kong and Shanghai, China in 1884. She hosted Empress Sh≈çken for the launching ceremony of the corvette Musashi on 30 March 1886 and was transferred to the Small Standing Fleet in 1887. The ship made a lengthy cruise in the Western Pacific in 1888 and visited ports in Korea, Russia and China the following year. Fus≈ç participated in the fleet maneuvers on 25 March 1880 and then hosted Emperor Meiji for his visits to Kure, Sasebo, and Etajima.Lengerer, Pt. III, pp. 45‚Äì46 From November 1891 to July 1894, Fus≈ç was extensively refitted and partially modernized at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Fus≈ç at anchor after her reconstruction During the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894, Fus≈ç was assigned to the rear of the Japanese main body and was heavily engaged by the Chinese ships. Although hit many times by shells, not one penetrated her armor; of her crew only five were killed and nine wounded.Jane, pp. 132, 148 During the battle her crew fired twenty-nine 24 cm, thirty-two 17 cm, one hundred thirty-six 75 mm, one hundred sixty-four 2.5- and 3-pounder shells and over fifteen hundred shells from her machine guns.Lengerer, Pt. II, p. 36 The ship was present during the Battle of Weihaiwei in January‚ÄìFebruary 1895, although she did not see any significant combat.Wright, pp. 100‚Äì04 On 29 October 1897, Fus≈çs anchor chain broke during a strong gale off Nagahama, Ehime and she collided with the ram of the protected cruiser Matsushima at 16:30. She then struck Matsushimas sister ship, , and sank at 16:57. Re-classed as a second-class battleship on 21 March 1898 and refloated on 7 July,Lengerer, Pt. III, p. 46 Fus≈ç was repaired at Kure Naval Arsenal and ran her trials on 8 April 1900. Fus≈ç served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Sukeuji Hosoya, Seventh Division, Third Squadron, during the Russo-Japanese War and was held in reserve south of Tsushima Island during the Battle of Tsushima in case the battle drifted her way. On 7 September 1904, her 15-centimeter guns were dismounted for use in the Siege of Port Arthur. They were replaced by guns transferred from the damaged at Maizuru Naval Arsenal on 28 December.Lengerer, Pt. II, pp. 37‚Äì38 She was reclassified as a coast defense ship in December 1905, and stricken on 1 April 1908. Relegated to the status of a \\"miscellaneous service craft\\", she was assigned to the Yokosuka Harbor Master until she was ordered to be sold on 15 February 1909. Yokosuka reported her sale on 30 November, but provided no information on the date of sale or the name of the winning bidder.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 336 - 337. History =Origins of the clan= Urquhart is a name that is derived from the place name, Airchart. Airchart is first recorded in the early life of Saint Columba, the great Celtic saint. In modern times there are two parishes in Scotland named Urquhart, one in Elgin and one on the Black Isle. The meaning of the word Urquhart itself has been given various Scottish Gaelic translations including woodside, by a rowan wood, or fort on a knoll. There is also Urquhart Castle on the banks of Loch Ness. One legend associated with Urquhart Castle involves Conachar of the royal house of Ulster, who is said to have come to Scotland to fight for Malcolm III of Scotland. Conachar was rewarded with the castle. The legend is also that Conachar was on the point of being mauled to death by a wild boar when his dog attacked the beast and although the dog died it saved his master. This is one explanation for the boar's head and hounds on the Urquhart chief's coat of arms. William de Urchard is said to have defended the Moote of Cromarty in the time of William Wallace against supporters of the English Crown. From the reign of David II of Scotland the Urquhart chiefs were hereditary sheriffs of Cromarty. =16th century and Anglo Scottish wars= Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty is said to have sired twenty-five sons in the early sixteenth century. However seven of these sons were killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. Another Thomas Urquhart was born on the day of the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh and was knighted by James VI of Scotland. =17th century and Civil War= Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, Knight, 12th Chief of Clan Urquhart, Baron and hereditary Sheriff of the District of Cromarty, from a 1641 engraving by George Glover A Victorian era, romanticised depiction of a member of the clan by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. Thomas Urquhart's son, Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty was a student at King's College, Aberdeen at the age of just eleven. He was knighted by Charles I of England in 1641. After the Civil War he traveled to the Continent and studied work by the French poet Fran√ßois Rabelais. Thomas Urquhart's translation of Rabelais's work is considered a masterpiece. Thomas rejoined the royalist army and fought at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, where he was taken prisoner and imprisoned in the Tower of London. While in prison he published his family tree which shows the origins of the Urquhart family back to Adam and Eve. When he was released he returned to the Continent where he is said to have died from laughter while celebrating the Restoration (1660). =18th century and Jacobite risings= Captain John Urquhart of Craigston (b.1696) was a man of great wealth but the origins of his fortune are shrouded in mystery. He was called the pirate by his family. He was recruited by the Spanish Navy and this is probably where he amassed his fortune, from the prize money that was paid for captured enemy vessels. He was nearly killed during the Jacobite rising of 1715 at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, fighting on the side of the Jacobites. The Urquhart of Craigston family became of such social eminence that they were able to get the great Henry Raeburn to paint their family portraits. Craigston Castle is still in the family's hands. Colonel James Urquhart also supported the Jacobite cause and was severely wounded at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. He was the principal Jacobite agent in Scotland until he died in 1741. The chiefship of the clan then passed to his cousin, William Urquhart of Meldrum, who was a cautious Jacobite and avoided the disaster at the Battle of Culloden. His cousin, Adam Urquhart was a member of Charles Edward Stuart's court-in-exile in Rome. =Modern history= The last of the chiefly line was Major Beauchamp Urquhart who was killed in 1898 at the Battle of Atbara in Sudan. In 1959 Wilkins Fisk Urquhart, a descendant of a branch of the clan known as the Urquharts of Braelangswell, who had emigrated to America in the 18th century, established his right to be chief of the Clan Urquhart. He was succeeded by his son, the historian Kenneth Trist Urquhart. The chief's title is Urquhart of Urquhart.

Professional wrestling career He became interested in wrestling as a teen, watching the Mexican luchador El Santo. Also known as \\"El hijo de Do√±a Tatica\\", he worked for many years on Color Visi√≥n channel 9 during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, on a wrestling show called Lucha Libre Internacional. He was the main star of the show as well as the owner of the production company Dominicana de Espectaculos. He faced Ric Flair in 1982, where right before Flair passed out, the time limit ran out. The fans then celebrated Veneno \\"winning\\" the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, although his title reign is not officially recognized by the NWA. Outside the Dominican Republic, he is famous for his matches against Ric Flair. Flair said that he let Veneno defeat him in order to avoid a riot among the Dominicans against him. Veneno retired himself in 2000. In 2007 a trailer for a documentary featuring the lost footage of his match with Flair aired throughout the Dominican Republic, but was not released at that time. In April 2015 the documentary was finally released on the internet for free, and shows the only footage known to exist of the famous match, the film \\"Jack; La Historia de Jack Veneno\\" features Jack and others discussing his career and life. The film was produced by Benjamin Irish, a protege of Veneno, and is widely attributed to Veneno's resurgence of celebrity in the country after 2007. Political career Although retired from wrestling, Veneno ran for Mayor of Santo Domingo Norte, one of the Santo Domingo Province municipalities, on the 2006 Congressional and Municipal Elections with the Institutional Social Democratic Bloc party.

Adopted wavelength for propagation is 1 ¬µm. Aperture real amplitude as estimated at focus of a half inch perfect lens having Fresnel number equal to 1. Adopted wavelength for propagation is 1 ¬µm. Aperture real amplitude as estimated at focus of a half inch perfect lens having Fresnel number equal to 0.01. Adopted wavelength for propagation is 1 ¬µm. The Fresnel number (F), named after the physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, is a dimensionless number occurring in optics, in particular in scalar diffraction theory. For an electromagnetic wave passing through an aperture and hitting a screen, the Fresnel number F is defined as : F = \\\\frac{a^{2}}{L \\\\lambda} where : a is the characteristic size (e.g. radius) of the aperture : L is the distance of the screen from the aperture : \\\\lambda is the incident wavelength. The Fresnel number is a useful concept in physical optics. Conceptually, it is the number of half-period zones in the wavefront amplitude, counted from the center to the edge of the aperture, as seen from the observation point (the center of the imaging screen), where a half-period zone is defined so that the wavefront phase changes by \\\\pi when moving from one half-period zone to the next. An equivalent definition is that the Fresnel number is the difference, expressed in half-wavelengths, between the slant distance from the observation point to the edge of the aperture and the orthogonal distance from the observation point to the center of the aperture. The Fresnel number establishes a coarse criterion to define the near and far field approximations. Essentially, if Fresnel number is small ‚Äì less than roughly 1 ‚Äì the beam is said to be in the far field. If Fresnel number is larger than 1, the beam is said to be near field. However this criterion does not depend on any actual measurement of the wavefront properties at the observation point. Another criterion called Gaussian pilot beam allowing to define far and near field conditions, consists to measure the actual wavefront surface curvature for an unaberrated system. In this case the wavefront is planar at the aperture position, when the beam is collimated, or at its focus when the beam is converging/diverging. In detail, within a certain distance from the aperture ‚Äì the near field ‚Äì the amount of wavefront curvature is low. Outside this distance ‚Äì the far field ‚Äì the amount of wavefront curvature is high. This concept applies equivalently close to the focus. According to the user manual for the Zemax optical design software, the correct approximation for propagation in the near field follows the angular spectrum method. This approximation works well when at the observation point the distance to the aperture is of the same order as the aperture size. This propagation regime satisfies \\\\ F \\\\gg 1. The correct approximation for the propagation in the near field is Fresnel diffraction. This approximation works well when at the observation point the distance to the aperture is bigger than the aperture size. This propagation regime verifies \\\\ F \\\\sim 1. Finally, once at the observation point the distance to the aperture is much bigger than the aperture size, propagation becomes well described by Fraunhofer diffraction. This propagation regime verifies \\\\ F \\\\ll 1. The Gaussian pilot beam This criterion, firstly described by and now adopted in propagation codes like, allows one to determine the realm of application of near and far field approximations taking into account the actual wavefront surface shape at the observation point, to sample its phase without aliasing. This criterion is named Gaussian pilot beam and fixes the best propagation method (among angular spectrum, Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction) by looking at the behavior of a Gaussian beam piloted from the aperture position and the observation position. Near/far field approximations are fixed by the analytical calculation of the Gaussian beam Rayleigh length and by its comparison with the input/output propagation distance. If the ratio between input/output propagation distance and Rayleigh length returns \\\\le 1 the surface wavefront maintains itself nearly flat along its path, which means that no sampling rescaling is requested for the phase measurement. In this case the beam is said to be near field at the observation point and angular spectrum method is adopted for the propagation. At contrary, once the ratio between input/output propagation distance and Gaussian pilot beam Rayleigh range returns > 1 the surface wavefront gets curvature along the path. In this case a rescaling of the sampling is mandatory for a measurement of the phase preventing aliasing. The beam is said to be far field at the observation point and Fresnel diffraction is adopted for the propagation. Fraunhofer diffraction returns then to be an asymptotic case that applies only when the input/output propagation distance is large enough to consider the quadratic phase term, within the Fresnel diffraction integral, negligible irrespectively to the actual curvature of the wavefront at the observation point. As the figures explain, the Gaussian pilot beam criterion allows describing the diffractive propagation for all the near/far field approximation cases set by the coarse criterion based on Fresnel number.

A. Scott Kelso (born 1947 in Derry, Northern Ireland) is a neuroscientist, and Professor of Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, Professor of Psychology, Biological Sciences and Biomedical Science at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in Boca Raton, Florida and The University of Ulster (Magee Campus) in Derry, N. Ireland. Kelso has worked on coordination dynamics, the science of coordination and on fundamental mechanisms underlying voluntary movements and their relation to the large-scale coordination dynamics of the human brain. His experimental research in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to the HKB model (Haken‚ÄìKelso‚ÄìBunz),Haken‚ÄìKelso‚ÄìBunz model ‚Äì Scholarpedia a mathematical formulation that quantitatively describes and predicts how elementary forms of coordinated behavior arise and change adaptively as a result of nonlinear interactions among components. Biography Kelso was born in the city of Derry, Northern Ireland. He attended Foyle College (1958‚Äì1965), receiving his undergraduate education at Stranmillis University College Belfast from 1965 to 1969, and the University of Calgary, Alberta from 1971 to 1972. He obtained his PhD from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1975. From 1976 to 1978 Kelso was Assistant Professor and Director of The Motor Behavior Laboratory at the University of Iowa. Between 1978 and 1985 he was Senior Research Scientist at Yale University's Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, Connecticut and Professor of Psychology and Biobehavioral Sciences (Unit of Behavioral Genetics) at the University of Connecticut. In 1985 he founded the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University, an interdisciplinary research center that includes neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, physicists, psychologists and computer scientists housed in the same physical facility, working together on common problems of complex, biological systems ranging from molecules to minds. Kelso leads a team of researchers in the Center's Human Brain and Behavior Laboratory.HBBL Webpage Since 1985, Kelso has held the Glenwood and Martha Creech Eminent Scholar Chair in Science at Florida Atlantic University, where he is also Professor of Psychology, Biological Sciences, and Biomedical Sciences. Kelso was Program Director of the NIMH‚Äôs National Training Program in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University between 1987 and 2005. Working with the FAU Administration and the Chancellor's office of the State University System, Kelso helped establish the Center's PhD Degree in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences. In 1995, Kelso co-directed the Summer School in Complex Systems at the Santa Fe Institute. He served as President of the South Florida chapter of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, from 1995 to 1999. He is a Member of the Scientific Board of the Plexus Institute, the World Council of the Einstein Institutes and the Advisory Board of the Intelligent Systems Research Center at the University of Ulster Magee Campus. Kelso has held visiting professorships in France, Germany, Russia and (currently) Ireland. He has also lectured extensively in the U.S.A. and abroad. He has received many honors and awards for his scientific research.Including the Distinguished Scholar Scientist Award from the North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity (1999) the Senior Scientist and MERIT Awards from the National Institutes of Health (1997) and the Distinguished Alumni Research Award from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1990). He is an elected Fellow of the American Psychological Association (1986), American Psychological Society (1990), American Association for the Advancement of Science (2004) and the recipient (2001) of a Docteur Honoris Causa Degree from the Republic of France and the University of Toulouse (Paul Sabatier). In 2007, he was named Pierre de Fermat Laureate.Observer ‚Äì Association for Psychological Science Work The objective of Kelso's research is to understand how human beings (and human brains ‚Äî singly and together) coordinate behavior. Kelso and his research team currently use non-invasive neuroimaging techniques (EEG, MEG, fMRI, PET, etc.) and statistical tools to gather information about the structure and function of the brain during real-time behavior. Over the last 30 years or so, along with colleagues working in laboratories around the world, he has participated in an interdisciplinary science called coordination dynamics. Coordination dynamics is an empirical and conceptual framework that tries to explain how patterns of coordination form, persist, adapt and change. The insights of coordination dynamics have been applied to predict behavior in different kinds of systems at different levels of analysis. Coordination dynamics is grounded in the concepts of synergetics and the mathematical tools of dynamical systems (see nonlinear dynamic systems theory and synergetics). But coordination dynamics seeks to model specific properties of human cognition, neurophysiology, and social function ‚Äì such as anticipation, intention, attention, decision-making and learning. The principal claim of coordination dynamics is that the coordination of neurons in the brain and the coordinated actions of people and animals are linked by virtue of sharing a common mathematical or dynamical structure. Kelso has worked on metastability in neuroscience. This concept has seen a growing interest among theoretical and computational neuroscientists, since it provides a mathematical formalization for the idea that the individual parts of the brain can on the one hand be specialized and segregated yet on the other hand function as an integrated whole.See for example Andrew and Alexander Fingelkurts (2004), \\"Making complexity simpler: multivariability and metastability in the brain.\\" International Journal of Neuroscience vol. 114, pp. 843‚Äì862. Kelso, J.A.S. & Tognoli, E. (2007) Toward a complementary neuroscience: Metastable coordination dynamics of the brain. In R.Kozma & L. Perlovsky (Eds.) Neurodynamics of Cognition and Consciousness. Springer, Heidelberg, pp. 39‚Äì60. =Early work= Kelso's early work used nerve block techniques to cut off sensory input from the limbs in humans.Kelso, J.A.S. (1973). The nerve compression block as a determiner of behavioral and neurological parameters. (M.S. Thesis, University of Wisconsin, 1973). University of Oregon: Microform Publications, BR295, 152 234. Kelso, J.A.S., Stelmach, G.E., & Wanamaker, W.M. (1974) Behavioral and neurological parameters of the nerve compression block. Journal of Motor Behavior, 6, 179‚Äì190. His experiments showed that even without conscious awareness of limb position, humans could move accurately to desired locations in space. Along with work conducted by Polit and Bizzi on monkeys at MITPolit, A., & Bizzi, E. (1978) Processes controlling arm movements in monkeys. Science, 201, 1235‚Äì1237. Kelso's research was a key to helping establish the equilibrium point theory of motor control originally postulated by Anatol Feldman.Kelso, J.A.S. (1977). Motor control mechanisms underlying human movement reproduction. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 3, 529‚Äì543. Then, working with his students David Goodman and Dan Southard he demonstrated‚Äîusing a pulsed light emitting diode technique long before the age of sophisticated computer assisted motion analysis‚Äîthat the brain controls the complex, coordinated movements of the upper limbs by exploiting functional synergies, a notion originally put forth by the Russian physiologist and cybernetician Nicolai Bernstein.See for example Kelso, J.A.S., Southard, D., & Goodman, D. (1979). On the nature of human interlimb coordination. Science, 203, 1029‚Äì 1031. Kelso, J.A.S. (2008). Synergies: Atoms of brain and behavior. In Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, Volume 629. (D. Sternad (Ed) A multidisciplinary approach to motor control). Springer, Heidelberg. Further work at Haskins Labs using a combination of novel perturbation techniques, kinematic and intramuscular recordings discovered that the control and coordination of complex speech gestures was also based on functional synergies or coordination structures.Kelso, J.A.S., Tuller, B., Bateson, E. V., & Fowler, C.A. (1984). Functionally specific articulatory cooperation following jaw perturbations during speech: Evidence for coordinative structures. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 10, 812‚Äì832. In asking how synergies might be formed in motor systems Kelso turned from Sherringtonian neurophysiology to theories of self-organization in particular the fledgling interdisciplinary field of synergetics founded by Hermann Haken.Haken, H. (1977/1983). Synergetics: Nonequilibrium phase transitions and self- organization in physics, chemistry and biology. Berlin, Springer At that time, the dominant understanding of animated movement was that behavior is determined by a \\"central program\\", a prearranged set of instructions that prescribe how a set of biomechanical components should behave. In contrast, Kelso showed experimentally that behavior can also emerge in a self-organizing way, as a result of highly nonlinear interactions among many interconnected elements. His experiments were the first to demonstrate the existence of phase transitions‚Äîsudden and spontaneous shifts from one coordinated state to another as a parameter is continuously varied. Phase transitions are a basic mechanism of self-organization in nature and Kelso's experiments, which have been replicated many times, were the first to show them in the coordinated movements of human beings.Kelso, J.A.S. (1984). Phase transitions and critical behavior in human bimanual coordination. American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative, 15, R1000 R1004. =HKB model= Kelso and his colleagues later demonstrated that many of the complexities of coordinated motor behavior in complex, multi-degree-of-freedom systems can be derived from relatively simple, but nonlinear mathematical laws. For a review of this work see Kelso et al. (1987) and Sch√∂ner and Kelso (1988)G. Sch√∂ner and J.A. Kelso (1988), \\"Dynamic pattern generation in behavioral and neural systems.\\" Science vol. 239, pp. 1513‚Äì1520; J.A.S. Kelso, et al. (1987), \\" Phase-locked modes, phase transitions and component oscillators in coordinated biological motion.\\" Physica Scripta vol. 35, pp. 79‚Äì87. In particular, Kelso developed a mathematical model in collaboration with the eminent theoretical physicist Hermann Haken, the father of laser theory and synergetics. This \\"HKB model\\" was able to derive basic forms of coordination observed in Kelso's experiments using a system of nonlinear relations between individual coordinating elementsHaken, H., Kelso, J. A. S., & Bunz, H. (1985). A theoretical model of phase transitions in human hand movements. Biological Cybernetics, 51, 347‚Äì356. The HKB model explained and predicted experimental observations such as \\"critical slowing down\\", and \\"enhanced fluctuations\\" associated with instability and dramatic changes in coordination. Later extensions of HKB accommodated the effects of noise, broken symmetry, multiple interacting heterogeneous components, recruitment-annihilation processes, parametric stabilization, and the role of changing environments on coordinationFor recent review see Kelso, J.A.S. (2009). Coordination Dynamics. In R.A. Meyers (Ed.) Encyclopedia of Complexity and System Science, Springer: Heidelberg. =Brain imaging work= Subsequently, Kelso and his colleagues moved from the hand to the brain, using large arrays of SQUID magnetometers to record the neuromagnetic activity of the brain and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to record BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) activation in brain regions.For example, see JAS Kelso et al. (1992), \\"A phase transition in human brain and behavior.\\" Physics Letters A vol. 169, pp. 134‚Äì144. Jantzen, K.J., Steinberg, F.L., & Kelso, J.A.S. (2008) Coordination dynamics of large scale neural circuitry underlying sensorimotor behavior. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience This work showed that mathematical forms observable in the coordinated movement of the hands (such as phase transitions), were also observable in images of brain activity. Or as Kelso puts it, \\"the same coordination dynamics governs brain activity and human behavior.\\"Note in Kelso's C.V., accessed 4 February 2009.

Traversing scales of brain and behavioral organization. I. Concepts and experiments. In C. Uhl (Ed.), Analysis of Neurophysiological Brain Functioning. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 73‚Äì89. =Current research= Kelso's current work focuses on whether the same principles and mechanisms of coordination dynamics apply also to human brains working together in social settings. Using large electrode arrays now available in the field of electroencephalography (EEG), he and his co-workers have been imaging the brains of pairs of humans, as they perform coordinated hand movements. Remarkably, Kelso's team has identified signatures in the brain that correspond to whether humans coordinate together or act independently.For example see Oullier, O., DeGuzman, G.C., Jantzen, K.J., Lagarde, J., & Kelso, J.A.S. (2008) Social coordination dynamics: Measuring human bonding. Social Neuroscience, 3, 178‚Äì192. + Tognoli, E., Lagarde, J., DeGuzman, G.C., & Kelso, J.A.S.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104, 8190‚Äì8195 (from the cover; see also Scientific American Mind, August 2007). In another line of research, Kelso and colleagues have created a novel way to understand the real time interaction between a human and a machine, called Virtual Partner Interaction (VPI). In VPI, humans coordinate with a virtual partner whose behavior is driven by a computerized version of the HKB equations, known to govern basic forms of human coordination. VPI is a principled approach to human-machine interaction and may open up new ways to understand how humans interact with human-like machines.Kelso, J.A.S., DeGuzman, G.C., Reveley, C., & Tognoli, E. (2009). Virtual Partner Interaction (VPI): Exploring novel behaviors via coordination dynamics. PLoSONE, 4(6):e5749 =Books= Kelso's first full-length book, Dynamic Patterns : The Self-Organization of Brain and Behavior (MIT Press, 1995) summarizes the first 20 years of his theoretical and experimental work on coordination, and argues that the creation and evolution of patterned behavior at all levels‚Äîfrom neurons to mind‚Äîis governed by the dynamical processes of self-organization. The book is written for the general reader, and uses simple experimental examples and illustrations to convey essential concepts, strategies, and methods, with a minimum of mathematics. With Viktor Jirsa, Kelso edited the book Coordination Dynamics: Issues and Trends (Springer, 2004). Kelso is also the Founding Editor for the Springer series on \\"Understanding Complex Systems\\" and has served on the Editorial Boards of 10 scientific journals/periodicals in various disciplines. Kelso's second full-length book, written with his former postdoc David A. Engstr√∏m, is The Complementary Nature (MIT Press, 2006). This book attempts to reconcile what it calls \\"the philosophy of complementary pairs\\" with the science of coordination dynamics. Pairs of opposites are found everywhere in nature and in science (e.g. cooperation and competition, integration and segregation, individual and collective, self and other, body and mind, nature and nurture, etc. etc.). Kelso and Engstr√∏m argue that these pairs are not mutually exclusive, but complementary. They propose a comprehensive, empirically-based scientific theory of how contraries can be reconciled based on Kelso's theory of metastable coordination dynamics. The essence of the theory is that the human brain is capable of displaying two apparently contradictory, mutually exclusive behaviors ‚Äì integration and segregation ‚Äì at the same time. Kelso and Engstr√∏m use the tilde, or squiggle (~), as the symbol for reconciled complementary pairs (e.g. body~mind, nature~nurture). The squiggle exposes a basic truth: both complementary aspects and their dynamics are needed for an exhaustive description and understanding of the complex phenomena and systems in life, mind, society and nature.Kelso, J.A.S.

He hosted the TV show El Gordo de La Semana and he was a staple of primetime (and late night) TV. He was one of the most recognized personalities in the Dominican Republic.Estilos ‚Äì Freddy Beras Goico, comunicador y empresario  Biography  During the 1950s, his family fled the Dominican Republic due to the brutal regime of the Trujillo dictatorship and settled in Colombia, where he spent several years before returning to his homeland. These experiences would shape his comedic style, making him a well-known entertainer for years to come. He was also tortured by the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo.  Career  Early in his career Beras-Goico's comedic style was mainly based on sketch comedy vignettes in several daytime TV shows, later moving on to having his own personal show, El Gordo De La Semana (lit. The Fat Guy of The Week), which matured into a successful TV variety show. The show's roster of comedians and personalities included: Cuqu√≠n Victoria, Milton Pel√°ez, Roberto Salcedo, and others.  Personal life and family  The origin of the Beras (his father‚Äôs family name) is Lebanese, and originally it was spelled as B√°rah; and the origin of Goico (his mother‚Äôs family name) is Serbian, originally spelled as Goicovich (Gojkoviƒá/–ì–æ—ò–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ). By his mother he also had French and Russian ancestry. Beras Goico married twice, first to the singer Luchy Vicioso, and then to his now widow Pilar Mej√≠a. He had several children. He was nephew of the archbishop of Santo Domingo, Cardinal Octavio Beras; and cousin of Spanish-language television star Charyt√≠n Goyco. In his late years, he converted to Christianity.  Career  Beras Goico returned to the Dominican Republic in the sixties. He started his career working as cameraman. Then in advertising but was always linked to television. Many times, Beras- Goico and the crew would laugh themselves to tears. He began creating comedic shows for radio and TV, and met many friends that became, along with him, the best comedy team of Dominican television: Felipe Polanco, Cuquin Victoria,Estilos ‚Äì Cuqu√≠n Victoria, personajes a medida Cecilia Garcia, Milton Pelaez, Nany Pe√±a, Kenny Grull√≥n, and many more. During most comedy sketches, Beras-Goico and his actors were rarely able to stifle their laughter. Sometimes, Beras-Goico's laughter would become so contagious, that soon the entire cast and crew would start shaking in hysterical attempts to control their own laughter.

He created the spiral hairpin and a type of carburettor called a petrol economizer, which increased engine performance and reduced fuel consumption. Background 1882 Shand Mason and Co fire engine Godward was born in Marylebone, London on 7 April 1869. He was the son of Henry Robert Godward, a fireman, and his wife, Sarah Ann Pattison.Ernest Robert Godward, Te Ara - Encyclopedia of New Zealand, retrieved 28 September 2016 When Godward was 12 he was sent to prep-school but ran away to sea reaching Japan where he worked on a cabling ship between Nagasaki and Vladivostok before he was returned home by the British Consul, Nicholas Hannen.Truly a man of many talents, Allison Rudd, Otago Daily Times, 17 August 2013, retrieved 29 September 2016Spiral hairpin, What the British Invented: From the Great to the Downright Bonkers, Gilly Pickup, Amberley Publishing Limited, 15 November 2015 On his return he was apprenticed to Shand, Mason and Co in London where he trained as a mechanic. Shand Mason were a firm of hydraulic engineers and steam powered fire engine manufacturers. Quitting Shand Mason he returned to the sea in 1884 as a ship's steward. In 1886 Godward emigrated to New Zealand arriving at Port Chalmers aboard the 1310 ton Shaw, Savill & Albion Line sailing ship Nelson on 31 December. During his time in Dunedin he learned to play the banjo and formed a music group called the Star Variety Company. He worked in the cycle trade for Sam Stedman before shifting to Invercargill in 1893. There he became a partner in the Southland Cycle Works (later Godward and McKenzie) of Dee Street. Southland Cycle Works made Sparrowhawk cycles. On 28 January 1896 he married Marguerita Florence Celena Treweek and the couple had 10 children. Nine of their own plus a niece of Marguerita's. Inventions Leaving the Southland Cycle Works in 1900 Godward embarked on inventing and manufacturing a wide range of everyday objects. Included among these were a non-slip egg-beater, a new post-hole borer, a new type of hair curler, a burglar-proof window and a hedge trimmer made from bicycle parts. He founded the Godward Spiral Pin and New Inventions Co Ltd which was a listed company on the New Zealand stock exchange. Major financial success came in 1901 with the invention of the spiral hairpin he had patented in 1899.Omnium Gatherum, Otago Daily Times, Issue 11521, 6 September 1899, page 6 Godward sold the American rights to the spiral hairpin for ‚Ç§20,000, which was a fortune at that time. Political career From 1903-1906 Godward served on the North Invercargill Borough Council, painted portraits and landscapes, played a variety of musical instruments, sang in local musical productions, and in 1908 was involved in Southland's first hot air ballooning. He was a skilled sportsman: cycling for the Invercargill Cycle Club, running, swimming and one of the founders of the Invercargill Amateur Swimming Club in 1903, rowing, and boxing. In 1909 Godward together with Robert Murie won a motor race from Invercargill to Dunedin and back. A few weeks later a second race was run, with Godward and Murie crashing avoiding a dray. The race drew criticism from the Police, Automobile Association, and local Councils.Southland Times, Issue 18071, 14 February 1903, page 2 Rockhaven From 1905 to 1908 Godward built an impressive new house, Rockhaven at 397 Queens Drive. The house was designed by a relatively unknown architect, Peter Walker. The house is a significant example of Queen Anne style and carries a Category 2 Historic Place designation. His wife lived in Rockhaven until 1946 when it was sold to Invercargill farmer Harold Smith. The Smith's owned the house until 1977. The house remains a private residence and the garage where Godward worked was still standing in 2013.http://www.heritage.org.nz/the- list/details/2509, retrieved 11 April 2018 Murder attempt In 1908 Godward was a witness in the Coldstream shooting case. Maud Buchanan was accused of attempting to shoot Vera McKay. The Buchanans had been looking after the McKays' property while the McKays were in America. After the McKays returned, the Buchanans continued to reside at the property for a short time before returning to their own home. While they were at the McKays', Mrs Buchanan had had a falling out with Mrs McKay over a conversation that Mrs McKay had repeated to someone. After the Buchanans returned to their own home they began to receive anonymous letters which Mrs Buchanan considered were being sent by the McKays. Mrs Buchanan approached Mr McKay requesting he stop the letters and when he said he did not know where they were coming from Mrs Buchanan became upset. Later the same day the Buchanans and Godward were leaving the Buchanans' home, Coldstream, by car to attend a concert. On finding the exit gate closed Godward got down from the car and went to open it. While doing that he heard two shots which he initially thought were the car backfiring. Turning he saw Mrs Buchanan with a revolver pointing at Mrs McKay. She fired another shot, hitting Mrs McKay in the arm, and then two more at Mr McKay before he overpowered her. The later court case found that Mrs Buchanan did not intend to kill or injure, but merely to stop the anonymous letters by scaring the McKays. Mrs Buchanan was found not guilty.Coldstream Shooting Case, Southland Times, Issue 12197, 22 December 1908, page 4Supreme Court, Southland Times, Issue 14047, 4 March 1909, page 2 Economiser Godward set up his own cycle business in 1908 and after a short time began importing Reo motor cars. He turned his attention to improving these and developed a carburettor in 1912 called the Eclipse Petrol Economiser. In 1913 he took his invention to London where he established the Godward Carburettor Company at Kingston upon Thames and patented the device in 1914. This venture proved less successful than he had hoped, so in 1916 Godward opened an office in New York, basing himself there. In 1926 he developed an improved version of the carburettor named the Godward Vaporiser. The Vaporiser enabled motor vehicles to use fuel oil instead of petrol. The Mitten Company of Philadelphia, one of the largest public transport operators in the United States, adopted the invention. Some 580 buses and 3000 taxis were fitted with the vaporiser.Fuel oil for cars, The Bismarck Tribune, Bismarck, North Dakota, Saturday, April 27, 1929 - Page 6, retrieved 30 September 2016 It was said to increase horsepower by 15%.

He did make a partial recovery from these losses and during his later years in the United States was recognised as one of the world's leading authorities on internal combustion engines. Godward died of a heart attack on 2 December 1936 on board the SS Mongolia while returning home to Invercargill. He had won a skipping contest on board the day before.Death at Sea, Evening Post, Volume CXXII, Issue 138, 8 December 1936 According to his biography there was speculation that Godward had another family in the United States. The family related a story of an American woman arriving at Rockhaven some time after Godward's death to collect a Ming vase she said was promised her. She was turned away.

It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors. Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope .Malkoske, G. R. Cobalt-60 production in CANDU power reactors Measurable quantities are also produced as a by-product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur. In the latter case (in the absence of added cobalt) the incidentally produced is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor's steel structuresUS EPA Radiation Protection: Cobalt via the creation of its precursor. The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of . decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel-60 (). The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV, hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is + n ‚Üí ‚Üí + e‚àí \\\\+ + gamma rays. Activity Corresponding to its half-life, the radioactive activity of one gram of is 44 TBq (about 1100 curies). The absorbed dose constant is related to the decay energy and time. For it is equal to 0.35 mSv/(GBq h) at one meter from the source. This allows calculation of the equivalent dose, which depends on distance and activity. For example, a source with an activity of 2.8 GBq, which is equivalent to 60 ¬µg of pure , generates a dose of 1 mSv at one meter distance within one hour. The swallowing of reduces the distance to a few millimeters, and the same dose is achieved within seconds. Test sources, such as those used for school experiments, have an activity of <100 kBq. Devices for nondestructive material testing use sources with activities of 1 TBq and more. The high Œ≥-energies result in a significant mass difference between and of 0.003 u.

The main Œ≤-decay transitions are shown. The probability for population of the middle energy level of 2.1 MeV by Œ≤-decay is 0.0022%, with a maximum energy of 665.26 keV. Energy transfers between the three levels generate six different gamma-ray frequencies. In the diagram the two important ones are marked.

It decays by internal transition to , emitting 58.6 keV gamma rays, or with a low probability (0.22%) by Œ≤-decay into . Applications The main advantage of is that it is a high intensity gamma-ray emitter with a relatively long half-life, 5.27 years, compared to other gamma ray sources of similar intensity. The Œ≤-decay energy is low and easily shielded; however, the gamma-ray emission lines have energies around 1.3 MeV, and are highly penetrating. The physical properties of cobalt such as resistance to bulk oxidation and low solubility in water give some advantages in safety in the case of a containment breach over some other gamma sources such as caesium-137. The main uses for are: * As a tracer for cobalt in chemical reactions * Sterilization of medical equipment. * Radiation source for medical radiotherapy. Cobalt therapy, using beams of gamma rays from teletherapy machines to treat cancer. * Radiation source for industrial radiography. * Radiation source for leveling devices and thickness gauges. * Radiation source for pest insect sterilization.Croatia fruit farmers fight flies * As a radiation source for food irradiation and blood irradiation. Cobalt has been discussed as a \\"salting\\" element to add to nuclear weapons, to produce a cobalt bomb, an extremely \\"dirty\\" weapon which would contaminate large areas with nuclear fallout, rendering them uninhabitable. In one hypothetical design, the tamper of the weapon would be made of . When the bomb exploded, the excess neutrons from the nuclear fission would irradiate the cobalt and transmute it into . No nation is known to have done any serious development of this type of weapon. Occurrence There is no natural in existence on earth; thus, synthetic is created by bombarding a target with a slow neutron source. Californium-252, moderated through water, can be used for this purpose, as can the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor. The CANDU reactors can be used to activate , by substituting the stainless steel control rods with cobalt rods.Isotope Production: Dual Use Power Plants In the United States, it is now being produced in a BWR at Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station.

The remainder is taken up by tissues, mainly the liver, kidneys, and bones, where the prolonged exposure to gamma radiation can cause cancer. Over time, the absorbed cobalt is eliminated in urine. =Steel contamination= Cobalt is an element used to make steel. Uncontrolled disposal of in scrap metal is responsible for the radioactivity found in several iron-based products.radioactive contamination of steel Around 1983, construction was finished of 1700 apartments in Taiwan which were built with steel contaminated with cobalt-60. Approximately 10,000 people occupied these buildings during a 9‚Äì20 year period. On average, these people received a radiation dose of 0.4 Sv, unknowingly. This large group did not suffer a higher incidence of cancer mortality, as the LNT theory would predict, but suffered a lower cancer mortality than the general Taiwan public. These observations appear to be compatible with the radiation hormesis model. In August 2012, Petco recalled several models of steel pet food bowls after US Customs and Border Protection determined that they were emitting low levels of radiation. The source of the radiation was determined to be that had contaminated the steel. In May 2013 a batch of metal-studded belts sold by online retailer ASOS were confiscated and held in a US radioactive storage facility after testing positive for . =Incidents involving medical radiation sources= In the Samut Prakan radiation accident in 2000, a disused radiotherapy head containing a source was stored at an unsecured location in Bangkok, Thailand and then accidentally sold to scrap collectors. Unaware of the dangers, a junkyard employee dismantled the head and extracted the source, which remained unprotected for a period of days at the junkyard. Ten people, including the scrap collectors and workers at the junkyard, were exposed to high levels of radiation and became ill. Three of the junkyard workers subsequently died as a result of their exposure, which was estimated to be over 6 Gy. Afterward, the source was safely recovered by the Thai authorities. In December 2013, a truck carrying a disused 111 TBq 60Co teletherapy source from a hospital in Tijuana to a radioactive waste storage center was hijacked at a gas station near Mexico City. The truck was recovered shortly after, but it was discovered that the thieves had removed the source from its shielding. It was found abandoned and intact in a field close by. Despite early reports with lurid headlines asserting that the thieves were \\"likely doomed\\", the radiation sickness was mild enough that the suspects were quickly released to police custody, and no one is known to have died from the incident. Parity In 1957, Chien-Shiung Wu et al. discovered the Œ≤-decay process violated parity, implying nature has a handedness. In the Wu experiment her group aligned radioactive nuclei by cooling the source to low temperatures in a magnetic field. Wu's observation was that more Œ≤-rays were emitted in the opposite direction to the nuclear spin. This asymmetry violates parity conservation.

History The Anaiwan group of Indigenous Australians were the inhabitants of the region surrounding Guyra. It was originally known as Hillgo'el or Illgoel, an Aboriginal word of the Yukambal meaning a \\"swamp\\" and was later changed to the name of Marsh's run, \\"Guyra\\". The name Guyra is said to originate from the language of the Anaiwan people; meaning 'white cockatoo' or 'fishing place'. The Gumbayniggir group of Indigenous Australians were the inhabitants of eastern Guyra surrounding area. Guyra was known to the Gumbayniggir people as Black Cockatoo which can be found in the Kumbangirir Language booklet. Settlement by European farmers began in the 1835 when Alexander Campbell took up Guyra Station, which encompassed the present town area. Ollera Station was settled in 1838 and had the first church in the Guyra district when it was built in 1876.

Dairying was an important industry during the 1890s after which potato growing became more popular. Guyra Post Office opened on 1 May 1877. The railway was officially opened on 19 August 1884, as part of the Great Northern Railway extension from Armidale to Glen Innes. Guyra became the focus of national attention on 5 February 1960 when a four-year-old boy named Steven Walls wandered off from his father on a property north of the town and became lost for four days. Hundreds of volunteers searched the bush for the boy until he was discovered asleep against a log. His immediate question to searchers was 'Where's my daddy, where's my daddy?'; which gave rise to a hit song by singer Johnny Ashcroft, entitled 'Little Boy Lost'. A film of the events was later commercially made using many of the local people of Guyra and shown across Australia.

The War of the Mantuan Succession (1628‚Äì31) was a peripheral part of the Thirty Years' War. Its casus belli was the extinction of the direct male line of the House of Gonzaga in December 1627. Brothers Francesco IV (1612), Ferdinando (1612‚Äì26) and Vincenzo II (1626‚Äì27), the last three dukes of Mantua from the direct line, had all died leaving no legitimate heirs. The war, fought among the backers of rival claimants, pitted France against the Habsburgs in a contest for control of northern Italy. Background Mantua is the ancestral city where the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled, first as marquesses, then after 1540 as dukes, in vassalage to the Holy Roman Empire. Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, the father of Francis' wife Margaret of Savoy, claimed Montferrat for his house, triggering the War of the Montferrat Succession (1613‚Äì1617), which eventually confirmed Ferdinando I (1587‚Äì1626) as the rightful successor. When Ferdinando died in 1626, his brother Vincenzo II (1594‚Äì1627) succeeded him as Duke of Mantua and Montferrato. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated. Nevers was the eldest son and heir of Charles, Duke of Nevers, Rethel and Mayenne. Moreover, he was the head of the cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, and after Vincenzo II, heir maleWhether the inheritance could pass through a female was in debate. of the Duchy of Mantua. Northern Italy was a strategic battlefield for France and the Habsburgs for centuries, ending only when Austria was expelled from Lombardy after the 1859 Second Italian War of Independence. Control of this area allowed the Habsburgs to threaten France's restive southern provinces of Languedoc and the Dauphin√©, as well as protecting the supply route known as the Spanish Road; this meant a succession dispute in Mantua inevitably involved outside parties. Claimants and their supporters The Duke of Nevers was a son of Louis, younger brother of Vincenzo II's grandfather (see family tree). Louis had been naturalized French about 1550, and married the heiress of the duchies of Nevers and Rethel in 1566. For the French Crown Nevers, a French peer, would naturally be preferable as ruler in Mantua. Nevers arrived there in January 1628 and was proclaimed its sovereign. There were two rival claimants. One was Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, whose daughter Margaret was the widow of Francis IV. Although their son had died an infant in 1612, it was their elder daughter Maria (1612‚Äì1660) who had married Charles de Nevers in 1627. Charles Emmanuel based his right to Mantua on his daughter's claim to a substantial portion of the Gonzaga realm, the duchy of Montferrat, which was demonstrably heritable by females since the Gonzagas had acquired it through marriage to Margherita Paleologa in 1540. The other claimant was Ferrante II, Duke of Guastalla, a distant Gonzaga cousin who voiced his claim but did not immediately place troops in the field. He was, however, supported by Emperor Ferdinand II, whose wife at the time, Eleanor of Mantua the elder (1598‚Äì1655), had been the sister of the last three Dukes of Mantua. He sought to re-attach the Duchy of Mantua to the Holy Roman Empire; Ferrante being in the Imperial-Spanish camp, was a useful tool to that purpose. But as the Thirty Years' War wore on, it affected dynastic alliances. Charles Emmanuel obtained support from the Habsburgs, who controlled Milan. The resulting French-Habsburg war over the succession was just one of the many theatres of the Thirty Years' War, fought all over Europe. Conflict The initial attempt of Don Gonzalo Fernandez de C√≥rdoba, Spanish governor of Milan, and Charles-Emmanuel was to partition the Mantuan-Montferrat patrimony, which lay to east and to west of Milan. The Spanish minister supported the Guastalla claimant in Mantua, as the weaker of two neighbors, and the Savoy claimant in Montferrat, the lesser of the territories. Friction between the confederates ensued, when Charles-Emmanuel moved his troops into more territory than had been agreed upon, laying siege to the town of Casale, capital of Montferrat. While Louis XIII of France and Cardinal Richelieu were concerned by new Huguenot uprisings in Languedoc, the capture of La Rochelle in 1628 allowed them to send forces to the relief of Casale, then besieged by a Habsburg army from Milan.Richelieu's address to the King, December 1628. In March 1629, the French stormed barricades blocking the Pas de Suse and by the end of the month they had lifted the siege of Casale and taken the strategic fortress of Pinerolo. In April, France and Savoy agreed the Treaty of Susa and the French army returned to France, leaving a garrison at Pinerolo. The papal envoy in negotiations at Casale was Jules Mazarin. Emperor Ferdinand II's forces under Ramboldo, Count of Collalto invaded the Grisons and Valtelline. The governor was recalled from Milan,His replacement was Ambrogio, marques di Spinola. followed by the insults of the citizens, for bread had been scarce for months. The following winter, Milan was devastated by the bubonic plague introduced by the armies, which has been vividly described by Manzoni. Alessandro Manzoni's The Betrothed (1842) Chapter XXVII contains a lightly ironic capsule account of the War of the Mantuan Succession, as background to his narration, continued, as a further digression, in Chapter XXVIII and culminating in his famous description of the bubonic plague which the German army brought to Milan, in Chapter XXXI. Later in 1629, Emperor Ferdinand II sent a Landsknecht army to besiege Mantua. Charles left without the promised support from Louis XIII of France. The siege lasted until July 1630, when the city, already struck by a plague, was brutally put to the sack for three days and three nights by troops led by Count Aldringen and Gallas. But the Emperor did not succeed in Mantua. Due to developments in Germany, where the Swedes were warring, he was forced to return his attention to the principal theatre of the big war. Peace of Regensburg (1630) The French first agreed to the Peace of Regensburg (or the Treaty of Ratisbonne), which was negotiated by French representatives Father Joseph and Nicolas Br√ªlart de Sillery. The accord was signed on 13 October 1630, which provided favorable terms to French interests in Italy despite their military setbacks. Specifically, the French were allowed to maintain their garrison in Grisons. The accord also confirmed Charles Gonzaga-Nevers as Duke of Mantua and Marquess of Montferrat in exchange for minor concessions to Charles Emmanuel of Savoy and Ferrante of Guastalla. The Habsburgs would on their side reduce their number of troops in the region. The treaty was seen as so unfavorable to the Spanish that the Spanish prime minister, Olivares, considered it no different than a surrender. The treaty, moreover, contained a troublesome clause. It included an agreement whereby the French were not permitted to establish alliances in Germany against a reigning Holy Roman Emperor. This should have sidelined France in the ongoing conflict. Louis XIII of France refused to accept this, and the Austrians found themselves still at war, yet with diminished forces in the area. The new forces sent south of the Alps were to be sorely missed when Swedish forces under Gustavus II Adolphus invaded from the north. Treaty of Cherasco (1631) The Italian peace was eventually made with the Treaty of Cherasco, signed in a city in Piedmont on 19 June 1631. France, which in 1629 had taken Savoy, then captured Pinerolo in Piedmont the following year, renounced its conquests in Italy. Charles Gonzaga-Nevers was confirmed as ruler in Mantua and Montferrat, with concessions to the other claimants: Vittorio Amedeo I, who succeeded in Savoy after the sudden death of his father, Duke Charles Emmanuel, gained Trino and Alba in Montferrat; while Cesare II of Guastalla, Ferrante's son, was given Luzzara and Reggiolo. Later it was discovered that by a secret treaty with Vittorio Amedeo, Pinerolo was surrendered to France.

The negotiations primarily involved the Delaware tribe but included other tribes as well. However, the negotiations excluded the Shawnee, who were minor inhabitants of the area and had previously been asked to leave by Miami War Chief Little Turtle. Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison negotiated the treaty with the tribes. The treaty led to a war with the United States begun by Shawnee leader Tecumseh and other dissenting tribesmen in what came to be called \\"Tecumseh's War\\". The parcels The treaty has two nicknames in popular American culture: the \\"Ten O'clock Line Treaty of 1809\\" and the \\"Twelve Mile Line Treaty\\", both of which are associated with the disparate parcels of land defined by the treaty. The first nickname comes from tradition that says the Native Americans did not trust the surveyors' equipment, so a spear was thrown down at ten o'clock and the shadow became the treaty line. The Twelve Mile Line was a reference to the Greenville Treaty and the establishment of a new 'line' parallel to it but twelve miles further west. Negotiations In 1809 Harrison began to push for a treaty to open more land for white American settlement. The Miami, Wea, and Kickapoo were \\"vehemently\\" opposed to selling any more land around the Wabash River.Owens, p. 200 To motivate those groups to sell their land, Harrison decided, against the wishes of President James Madison, to first conclude a treaty with the tribes who were willing to sell and use those treaties to help influence those who held out. In September 1809, Harrison invited the Potawatomie, Delaware, Eel Rivers, and the Miami to a meeting in Fort Wayne. During the negotiations, Harrison promised large subsidies and direct payments to the tribes if they would cede the other lands under discussion.Owens, p. 201-203 William Henry Harrison Only the Miami opposed the treaty. They presented a copy of the Treaty of Greenville to highlight the section that guaranteed their possession of the lands around the Wabash River. They then explained the history of the region and how they had invited the Wea and other tribes to settle in their territory as friends. The Miami were concerned that the Wea leaders were not present at the negotiations even though they were the primary inhabitants of the land being sold. The Miami also wanted any new land sales to be paid for by the acre, and not by the tract. Harrison agreed to make the treaty's acceptance contingent on approval by the Wea and other tribes in the territory being purchased, but he refused to purchase land by the acre. He countered that it was better for the tribes to sell the land in tracts so as to prevent the Americans from only purchasing their best lands by the acre and leaving the tribes with only poor land on which to live. After two weeks of negotiating, the Potawatomie leaders convinced the Miami to accept the treaty as reciprocity to the Potawatomie who had earlier accepted treaties less advantageous to their tribe at the request of the Miami. The Treaty of Fort Wayne was finally signed on September 29, 1809, selling the United States over 3,000,000 acres (approximately 12,000 km¬≤), mostly along the Wabash River north of Vincennes. With the help of Miami Chief Pacanne, who was influential with the Wea, Harrison later that winter was able to obtain the acceptance of the Wea by offering them a large subsidy. The Kickapoo were closely allied with the Shawnee at Prophetstown and Harrison feared they would be difficult to sway. He offered the Wea an increased subsidy if the Kickapoo would also accept the treaty, causing the Wea to pressure the Kickapoo leaders to accept, which they eventually did. By the spring of 1810, Harrison had completed negotiations and the treaty was finalized.Owens, p. 205 Aftermath Tecumseh was the powerful leader of a breakaway Shawnee group living just north of the area covered in the treaty. He questioned the legality of the treaty stating that these Native leaders did not have the right to sign the treaty, and rightfully sell land that is held in common with other Native peoples. In August 1810, he led 400 armed warriors from several different tribes in traveling down the Wabash to meet with Harrison in Vincennes. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate and asked Harrison to nullify it, ominously warning that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh acknowledged to Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms.Langguth, p. 164Owens, p. 212 Harrison responded to Tecumseh that the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so choose. In a move that further impacted American relations with the Indians, Harrison also rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed one nation and that each nation could have separate negotiations with the United States.Langguth, p. 165 Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty was nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.Langguth, p. 166 The situation continued to escalate, eventually leading to the outbreak of hostilities between Tecumseh's followers and American settlers later that year. Tensions continued to rise, leading to the Battle of Tippecanoe during a period sometimes called Tecumseh's War.Langguth, p. 167-169Owens, p. 214 The episode and its aftermath played a major role in Harrison‚Äôs successful 1840 campaign for the presidency.

He is thought to have been born in Richmond, Surrey. Allied with Napoleon In 1801, Goldsmith published The Crimes of Cabinets, or a Review of the Plans and Aggressions for Annihilating the Liberties of France and the Dismemberment of her Territories, an attack on the military policy of Pitt. Soon afterward, in 1802, he moved from London to Paris. There Talleyrand introduced him to Napoleon. With Napoleon's assistance, Goldsmith established the Argus, a biweekly publication in English reviewing English affairs from a French point of view. In 1803, according to Goldsmith's own account, he was entrusted with a mission to obtain from the Comte de Provence, the head of the French royal family and subsequent King Louis XVIII, a renunciation of his claim to the throne of France in return for the throne of Poland. The offer was declined. Goldsmith says he then received instructions to kidnap Louis, or to kill him if he resisted. Instead, Goldsmith revealed the plot. Until 1807, however, when his Republican sympathies began to wane, Goldsmith continued to undertake secret service missions on behalf of Napoleon. Goldsmith's hand has been seen in the Revolutionary Plutarch of 1804‚Äì05, an √©migr√© work edited in London, and with a title harking back to the British Plutarch of Thomas Mortimer. That would imply that Goldsmith was by then already playing a double game. Anti- Napoleon Goldsmith returned to England in 1809. At first he was arrested and imprisoned, but soon was released and established himself as a notary in London. By 1811 he had become strongly anti-republican, founding the Anti- Gallican Monitor and Anti-Corsican Chronicle (subsequently known as the British Monitor) through which he now denounced the French Revolution. He proposed that a price be put on Napoleon's head by public subscription, but found himself condemned by the British government. In 1810 he published Secret History of the Cabinet of Bonaparte and Recueil des manifestes, proclamations, discours, etc. de Napoleon Buonaparte (Collection of the Decrees of Napoleon Bonaparte); and in 1812 he published a Secret History of Bonaparte's Diplomacy. He claimed Napoleon then offered him 200,000 [francs?] to discontinue his attacks. In 1815, he published An Appeal to the Governments of Europe on the Necessity of Bringing Napoleon Bonaparte to a Public Trial. Later life In 1825, he moved back to Paris, publishing his Statistics of France a few years later. His only child, Georgiana, become the second wife of John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst in 1837.

Designed by architects Mario Pani and Enrique del Moral, it encloses the Olympic Stadium, about 40 faculties and institutes, the Cultural Center, an ecological reserve, the Central Library, and a few museums. It was built during the 1950s on an ancient solidified lava bed in Coyoac√°n called \\"El Pedregal\\" to replace the scattered buildings in downtown Mexico City where classes were given. It was completed in 1954 at a cost of approximately $25 million. At the time of its completion it was the largest single construction project in Mexico since the Aztecs.\\"Mexico Builds A Glamour Campus.\\" Popular Mechancs, May 1954, pp. 113-117. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. Although the University has other buildings in Mexico City (mostly for undergraduate studies and cultural purposes), in other Mexican states and in other countries (such as Canada and the United States), Ciudad Universitaria, known simply as \\"C.U.\\", is the prime symbol of the University. Atmosphere alt=A large outdoor area with blackish-gray stone flooring of irregularly-cut medium-sized panels with mortar between them. Behind them in the distance are a grassy area with trees, buildings, and a blue sky with clouds Ciudad Universitaria is an open place popular on Sundays with families that wish to explore its patios, gardens and footpaths that cover most of its . It was built on a lava layer thick which was deposited by the Xitle volcano around 100 AD. Due to its topography and vegetation, there are very few straight roads or paths. Roads tend to be concentric circuits, with buildings located within them. Some can only be reached by a short, 5- to 10-minute walk. Volcanic rock was removed to make room for the buildings, and it was used to make pathways and outer walls. Buildings themselves are made with common materials, concrete and brick being most common, and usually have big windows and gardens, both inside and outside. Most buildings have only two to three floors. Although different in style, gardens and volcanic rock are a common theme across all buildings with some notable exceptions: the Rectorate Tower and the Central Library. These tall, square-shaped buildings, somewhat isolated from the rest, are adorned by murals made by famous Mexican muralists David Alfaro Siqueiros (Rectorate Tower) and Juan O'Gorman (Central Library). The latter, recognized as the largest mural in the world, covering all sides of the Library, based on Aztec and Spanish motifs and UNAM's coat of arms, makes the Central Library Ciudad Universitaria's most iconic building. The Campus Central is the original campus built in 1943. Comprising , Insurgentes Avenue cuts across it. Sculptural space Inside the ecological reserve stands the Sculptural Space. It is a big round natural solidified lava bed surrounded by many white triangular prisms that seem to radiate from its center, a bit like a sunflower. There are many big and colorful metallic sculptures made by contemporary artists surrounding this area, hence its name.

Sports facilities University Olympic Stadium The Mexico '68 Olympic Stadium was built in 1952 and was used to host the 1955 Pan-American Games and the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City. It is located on the Campus Central portion of the city, and its stands were built with excavated lava rock. These stands contain reliefs designed by Diego Rivera. It was also used in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Now it holds football matches for Mexico's City university league, as well as being the home stadium for the university's team in the Mexican Football League, the \\"Pumas\\". It also has a race track, used for international invitation-only athletic competition in recent times due to the success of Mexican athlete Ana Guevara. One of the most renowned architecture of the Ciudad Universitaria de Mexico is the area of the \\"Frontones\\", which consists of a multipurpose building and ten courts for racquetball and handball game. There are also football and soccer fields for training of student and children teams. Gyms for martial arts, boxing training and other sports are near the stadium, intended mostly for students. Culture C.U. is an important part of Mexico City's cultural life. The campus contains many spaces dedicated to cultural activities from Music, Theatre, Cinema, Visual Arts etc. Most faculties have exhibition spaces and auditoriums used for such purposes. The University Cultural Centre (Centro Cultural Universitario) is a section of the campus containing the main auditoriums, theatres and cinemas. It also includes one of the most recent Contemporary Art Museums in Mexico, the Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporaneo. The Centre also includes facilities named for notable figures in Mexicsn history; *Sala Nezahualcoyotl. Used for orchestral and dance performances. *Teatro Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n. Major theatre.

It was eventually recognized an ingenious example of urban architectural design. It is also noted for its integration of modern architecture, Mexican traditions and artwork, including those by David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado and Francisco Eppens. Transportation There are eleven main bus routes in Ciudad Universitaria provided by the university itself, through its Internal Transport System. Routes 1 through 5 have their base on the west side of the University, near the metro exit for Metro Universidad station. Three other routes (6,7,8) have their base on parking number 1 of the Olympic stadium. They are free and run from Monday to Friday, from 06:20 until 22:30 hrs. Cars are allowed inside the campus, and there are also taxis taking passengers in groups, following the official bus routes. Some of these routes have long and short versions, a few first and last stops are the same but the long version takes a different route to less visited zones. Additionally, there is a temporary route to take new students to the registration center. There are three main points of entry to Ciudad Universitaria, two from the metro (Metro Universidad and Metro Copilco stations), and Avenida Insurgentes, running north to south, splitting Ciudad Universitaria in half, where two Metrob√∫s stations provide access to the campus: Ciudad Universitaria and Centro Cultural Universitario. This important avenue is useful to reach other parts of the city, and is near the Olympic Stadium and Cultural Zone. Lately, a program called \\"C.U. Limpia\\" (Clean C.U.) offers 58 bicycle stations around Ciudad Universitaria, these stations contain 200 bicycles each, all of them new, that can be rented by students and returned to any of the other stations around. These have become very popular with students and teachers trying to promote a less polluting mode of transportation. Security Entrance of a fire station over Ciudad Universitaria Despite its size and the lack of entry controls, Ciudad Universitaria is a very safe location for students and visitors alike. There is an internal surveillance group, \\"Auxilio UNAM\\" (UNAM Help). They patrol the campus all day, especially on vacation days and weekends. They have no firearms, but have hummers, motorcycles and golf carts. For historical and legal reasons to do with university autonomy, law enforcement officers do not enter Ciudad Universitaria unless specifically requested by the University authorities. Crimes do happen, but are sporadic and usually occur late at night, when most people (both students and employees) have already left. There is also an emergency medical station and a fire station inside campus. Shops There are university owned cafeterias around the campus, but they are \\"franchised\\" to cooperatives, with the exception of the cafeteria at the Faculty of Sciences (called Caf√© Ciencias) which is run solely by students. These cafeterias are permanent, one floor buildings and very similar to each other. There are also small, permanent shops on the side of some non-schooling buildings, where a full-size cafeteria would be impractical. Some of these shops offer photocopies and office supplies instead of food. Some semi- permanent shops, selling mostly candies and packaged food, are around the campus. These are built and dismantled every day but are very stable, lasting years in the same place. A few sell University memorabilia, mostly related to the soccer team. Around the campus, but mostly between the Central Library and the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature, one can find people selling crafts as well as music, films and books, some used, some new, but most of them pirated or bootlegged. Around the metro stations close to the University there are many food shops, but also bookstores, photocopying, photographic studios and the like. Near the northern station, Copilco, just outside Ciudad Universitaria, there are many printing shops running for some blocks, where students get their theses bound. Near Metro Universidad station, on the fringe of Ciudad Universitaria, there is the \\"Tienda UNAM\\" or UNAM Store. It is big supermarket that offers furniture, clothing, food and beverages, vegetables, electronic and computing equipment, toys and many other things. It is run by the University itself. Meant for university employees and their families, it is open to the general public.

For three seasons, he also played professional basketball. Career Widmar was born in Cleveland, Ohio, attending Cleveland's Cathedral Latin High School. He was originally signed by the Boston Red Sox in 1942 (prior to the draft), and played Minor League Baseball (MiLB) throughout the war years. Between 1947 and 1952, Widmar played for the BoSox (1947), St. Louis Browns (1948, 1950‚Äì51), and Chicago White Sox (1952). In a five-season major league career, Widmar posted a 13‚Äì30 record, with 143 strikeouts, and a 5.21 earned run average (ERA), in innings pitched. Widmar played part of two Major League seasons as a reliever with the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Browns. He made his MLB debut with the Red Sox in 1947, and was sent to the Browns before the 1948 season in the same trade that brought Vern Stephens to Boston. After an unspectacular year with the Browns, he was demoted to the MiLB International League Baltimore Orioles, St. Louis' Triple-A affiliate team. Beginning in the late-1940s, Widmar began to play professional basketball in the off-season ‚Äî in order to keep himself in shape. He played for the Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern Professional Basketball League (EPBL), and the Scranton Miners and Allentown / Carbondale Aces of the American Basketball League (ABL).

Print.  Diversity  Functional diversity is often referred to as the \\"value and the range of those species and organismal traits that influence ecosystem functioning‚Äù. Traits of an organism that make it unique, for example, way it moves, gathers resources, reproduces, or the time of year it is active add to the overall diversity of an entire ecosystem, and therefore enhance the overall function, or productivity, of that ecosystem. Functional diversity increases the overall productivity of an ecosystem by allowing for an increase in niche occupation. Species have evolved to be more diverse through each epoch of time, with plants and insects having some of the most diverse families discovered thus far. The unique traits of an organism can allow a new niche to be occupied, allow for better defense against predators, and potentially lead to specialization. Organismal level functional diversity, which adds to the overall functional diversity of an ecosystem, is important for conservation efforts, especially in systems used for human consumption. Functional diversity can be difficult to measure accurately, but when done correctly, it provides useful insight to the overall function and stability of an ecosystem.  Redundancy  Functional redundancy refers to the phenomenon that species in the same ecosystem fill similar roles, which results in a sort of \\"insurance\\" in the ecosystem. Redundant species can easily do the job of a similar species from the same functional niche. This is possible because similar species have adapted to fill the same niche overtime. Functional redundancy varies across ecosystems and can vary from year to year depending on multiple factors including habitat availability, overall species diversity, competition among species for resources, and anthropogenic influence. This variation can lead to a fluctuation in overall ecosystem production. It is not always known how many species occupy a functional niche, and how much, if any, redundancy is occurring in each niche in an ecosystem. It is hypothesized that each important functional niche is filled by multiple species. Similar to functional diversity, there is no one clear method for calculating functional redundancy accurately, which can be problematic. One method is to account for the number of species occupying a functional niche, as well as the abundance of each species. This can indicate how many total individuals in an ecosystem are performing one function.  Effects on conservation  Studies relating to functional diversity and redundancy occur in a large proportion of conservation and ecological research. As the human population increases, the need for ecosystem function subsequently increases. In addition, habitat destruction and modification continue to increase, and suitable habitat for many species continues to decrease, this research becomes more important. As the human population continues to expand, and urbanization is on the rise, native and natural landscapes are disappearing, being replaced with modified and managed land for human consumption. Alterations to landscapes are often accompanied with negative side effects including fragmentation, species losses, and nutrient runoff, which can effect the stability of an ecosystem, productivity of an ecosystem, and the functional diversity and functional redundancy by decreasing species diversity. It has been shown that intense land use affects both the species diversity, and functional overlap, leaving the ecosystem and organisms in it vulnerable. Specifically, bee species, which we rely on for pollination services, have both lower functional diversity and species diversity in managed landscapes when compared to natural habitats, indicating that anthropogenic change can be detrimental for organismal functional diversity, and therefore overall ecosystem functional diversity. Additional research demonstrated that the functional redundancy of herbaceous insects in streams varies due to stream velocity, demonstrating that environmental factors can alter functional overlap. When conservation efforts begin, it is still up for debate whether preserving specific species, or functional traits is a more beneficial approach for the preservation of ecosystem function. Higher species, diversity can lead to an increase in overall ecosystem productivity, but does not necessarily insure the security of functional overlap. In ecosystems with high redundancy, losing a species (which lowers overall functional diversity) will not always lower overall ecosystem function due to high functional overlap, and thus in this instance it is most important to conserve a group, rather than an individual. In ecosystems with dominant species, which contribute to a majority of the biomass output, it may be more beneficial to conserve this single species, rather than a functional group.. The ecological concept of keystone species was redefined based on the presence of species with non redundant trophic dynamics with measured biomass dominance within functional groups, which highlights the conservation benefits of protecting both species and their respective functional group https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol7/iss1/resp11/ . = Challenge = Understanding functional diversity and redundancy, and the roles each play in conservation efforts is often hard to accomplish because the tools with which we measure diversity and redundancy cannot be used interchangeably. Due to this, recent empirical work most often analyzes the effects of either functional diversity or functional redundancy, but not both. This does not create a complete picture of the factors influencing ecosystem production. In ecosystems with similar and diverse vegetation, functional diversity is more important for overall ecosystem stability and productivity. Yet, in contrast, functional diversity of native bee species in highly managed landscapes provided evidence for higher functional redundancy leading to higher fruit production, something humans rely heavily on for food consumption. A recent paper has stated that until a more accurate measuring technique is universally used, it is too early to determine which species, or functional groups, are most vulnerable and susceptible to extinction. Overall, understanding how extinction affects ecosystems, and which traits are most vulnerable can protect ecosystems as a whole.

He played parts of eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for nine different teams. The national high school player in the country in 1993, Livingston's college and professional careers were marked by a series of injuries that hampered his play. Livingston attended New Orleans' Isidore Newman School along with standout quarterback Peyton Manning, where he was named the High School co- player of the year in 1992 (with Jason Kidd) and 1993 (with Rasheed Wallace). Livingston also played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Magic's Roundball Classic. He was ranked as the #1 player in the 1993 class, over Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. Isidore Newman School retired Livingston's #50 jersey in 2013. After high school, Livingston attended Louisiana State University but only appeared in 32 games over two seasons because of knee problems. He was drafted by the Houston Rockets in the second round (42nd pick overall) of the 1996 NBA Draft, later he was signed as a free agent by the Atlanta Hawks in his second year. He played for the Phoenix Suns during the 1999 season, playing his most consistent season (79 games, 14 mpg, 4.8 points, 1.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game). He also played with the Suns during the 2000 season, which was the only time in his NBA career that he played on one team for two consecutive years. Afterwards, Livingston appeared sporadically (two games) for the Golden State Warriors during the following season, played for the Seattle SuperSonics in 2001‚Äì02, also dressing up with two teams in the CBA. He would play briefly for the New Orleans Hornets during 2002‚Äì03, was on the roster for the 2003-04 EA Sports Midwest All-Stars, and for the Los Angeles Clippers during the following and with the Utah Jazz in 2004‚Äì05. Livingston was drafted in the 2005 AAPBL Draft, but the league folded soon thereafter. He spent the beginning of 2005‚Äì06 in the Turkish league, playing for Galatasaray, and joined the NBA Development League's Stampede (for whom he had once played while the team competed in the CBA) in February 2006. He also appeared in five games with the Chicago Bulls in March. In 2006‚Äì07 he began with the Stampede once again but, on April 11, 2007, signed a contract for the remainder of the season with the SuperSonics, for a second time. This was due to almost simultaneous injuries to Earl Watson and Luke Ridnour. In 2006‚Äì07's NBDL, Livingston's 12.0 points per game for the Stampede were tied for 44th in the league and his 10.5 assists second only to Will Conroy. The following season, as the Stampede were crowned the competition's winners after beating the Austin Toros 2‚Äì1, Livingston retired from professional basketball. Although officially retired, the Erie BayHawks of the D-League still drafted him in the expansion draft, in hopes of bringing him out of retirement. After a stellar MVP season and leading the Idaho Stampede to its first and only NBA Development League Championship, the Idaho Stampede retired Livingston's Jersey which still hangs today at the Century Link Arena located in Boise Idaho. From 2010 to 2012, he was the head coach for the Idaho Stampede. After his stint coaching the Stampede, he moved to Australia, where he served as a scout and coaching consultant. In August 2016, he was voted into the greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame. He was also hired as an assistant basketball coach for Louisiana State University. In 2018, Livingston returned to Isidore Newman School and coached the 7th and 8th grade boys basketball team. The team went on to win the middle school city championship. The next season, Livingston was chosen to replace retiring Jimmy Tillette as head coach of Newman's varsity boys basketball team.https://www.fox8live.com/2019/03/26/randy-livingston-named-head- basketball-coach-newman/ One of his current players is Arch Manning, son of Cooper Manning and nephew to Peyton and Eli.

These cells cause disruption of the normal air spaces (alveoli) where oxygen is extracted from the atmosphere. Several different kinds of eosinophilic pneumonia exist and can occur in any age group. The most common symptoms include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and sweating at night. Eosinophilic pneumonia is diagnosed by a combination of characteristic symptoms, findings on a physical examination by a health provider, and the results of blood tests and X-rays. Prognosis is excellent once most eosinophilic pneumonia is recognized and treatment with corticosteroids is begun. Classification  Eosinophilic pneumonia is divided into different categories depending upon whether its cause can be determined or not. Known causes include certain medications or environmental triggers, parasitic infections, and cancer. Eosinophilic pneumonia can also occur when the immune system attacks the lungs, a disease called eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. When a cause cannot be found, the eosinophilic pneumonia is termed \\"idiopathic\\". Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia can also be divided into acute and chronic forms, depending on the symptoms a person is experiencing. Signs and symptoms  Most types of eosinophilic pneumonia have similar signs and symptoms. Prominent and nearly universal signs and symptoms include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and night sweats. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia typically follows a rapid course. Fever and cough may develop only one or two weeks before breathing difficulties progress to the point of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia usually follows a slower course. Symptoms accumulate over several months and include fever, cough, difficulty breathing, wheezing, and weight loss. Individuals with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia are often misdiagnosed with asthma before the correct diagnosis is made. Eosinophilic pneumonia due to medications or environmental exposures is similar and occurs after an exposure to a known offending agent. Eosinophilic pneumonia due to parasitic infections has a similar prodrome in addition to a host of different symptoms related to the variety of underlying parasites. Eosinophilic pneumonia in the setting of cancer often develops in the context of a known diagnosis of lung cancer, cervical cancer, or other certain types of cancer.  Pathophysiology  Eosinophilic pneumonia can develop in several different ways depending on the underlying cause of the disease. Eosinophils play a central role in defending the body against infection by parasites. Many diseases, such as asthma and eczema, are caused when eosinophils overreact to environmental triggers and release an excess of chemicals, e.g., cytokines and histamine. The common characteristic among different causes of eosinophilic pneumonia is eosinophil overreaction or dysfunction in the lungs. = Medications and environmental exposures = Medications, substance abuse, and environmental exposures may all trigger eosinophil dysfunction. Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen), nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, L-tryptophan, daptomycin and ampicillin, and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response which results in eosinophilic pneumonia. Chemicals such as sulfites, aluminum silicate, and cigarette smoke can cause eosinophilic pneumonia when inhaled. A New York City firefighter developed eosinophilic pneumonia after inhalation of dust from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. = Parasitic infections = Parasites cause eosinophilic pneumonia in three different ways. Parasites can either invade the lungs, live in the lungs as part of their life cycle, or be spread to the lungs by the bloodstream. Eosinophils then migrate to the lungs in order to fight the parasites, and cause eosinophilic pneumonia when they release their contents. Important parasites that invade the lungs include Paragonimus lung flukes and the tapeworms Echinococcus and Taenia solium. Important parasites which inhabit the lungs as part of their normal life cycle include the worms (helminths) Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. When eosinophilic pneumonia is caused by helminths, it is often called \\"L√∂ffler's syndrome\\". The final group of parasites cause eosinophilic pneumonia when their eggs are carried into the lungs by the bloodstream. This can include Trichinella spiralis, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, the hookworms, and the schistosomes. = Acute and Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia = The causes for both acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia are unknown as of 2005. There is some suspicion that at least the acute form is the result of the body's response to some unidentified environmental agent.  Diagnosis  Eosinophilic pneumonia is diagnosed in one of three circumstances: when a complete blood count reveals increased eosinophils and a chest X-ray or computed tomography identifies abnormalities in the lungs, when a biopsy identifies increased eosinophils in lung tissue, or when increased eosinophils are found in fluid obtained by a bronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Association with medication or cancer is usually apparent after review of a person's medical history. Specific parasitic infections are diagnosed after examining a person's exposure to common parasites and performing laboratory tests to look for likely causes. If no underlying cause is found, a diagnosis of acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is made based upon the following criteria. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is most likely with respiratory failure after an acute febrile illness of usually less than one week, changes in multiple areas and fluid in the area surrounding the lungs on a chest X-ray, and eosinophils comprising more than 25% of white blood cells in fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. Other typical laboratory abnormalities include an elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and immunoglobulin G level. Pulmonary function testing usually reveals a restrictive process with reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is most likely when the symptoms have been present for more than a month. Laboratory tests typical of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia include increased levels of eosinophils in the blood, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, iron deficiency anemia, and increased platelets. A chest X-ray can show abnormalities anywhere, but the most specific finding is increased shadow in the periphery of the lungs, away from the heart. =Differential diagnosis= This includes: * Asthma * Environmental allergic reaction * Granulomatosis with polyangiitis * Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis * Churg-Strauss syndrome * Loeffler's syndrome * Acute eosinophilic pneumonia * Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (Carrington's disease) * Polyarteritis nodosa * Parasitic infections * Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia * Tuberculosis * Fungal infection * Sarcoidosis * Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms * Mastocytosis * Lymphoproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome * Myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome  Treatment  When eosinophilic pneumonia is related to an illness such as cancer or parasitic infection, treatment of the underlying cause is effective in resolving the lung disease. When due to acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, however, treatment with corticosteroids results in a rapid, dramatic resolution of symptoms over the course of one or two days. Either intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone are most commonly used. In acute eosinophilic pneumonia, treatment is usually continued for a month after symptoms disappear and the X-ray returns to normal (usually four weeks total). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, treatment is usually continued for three months after symptoms disappear and the X-ray returns to normal (usually four months total). Inhaled steroids such as fluticasone have been used effectively when discontinuation of oral prednisone has resulted in relapse. Because eosinophilic pneumonia affects the lungs, individuals develop difficulty breathing. If enough of the lungs are involved, it may not be possible for a person to breathe without support. Non-invasive machines such as a bilevel positive airway pressure machine may be used. Otherwise, placement of a breathing tube into the mouth may be necessary and a ventilator may be used to help the person breathe.  Prognosis  Eosinophilic pneumonia due to cancer or parasitic infection carries a prognosis related to the underlying illness. Acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, however, have very little associated mortality as long as intensive care is available and treatment with corticosteroids is given. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia often relapses when prednisone is stopped; therefore, some people require lifelong therapy. Long- term use of prednisone has many side effects, including increased infections, osteoporosis, stomach ulcers, Cushing's syndrome, and changes in appearance.  Epidemiology  Eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare disease. Parasitic causes are most common in geographic areas where each parasite is endemic. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia can occur at any age, even in previously healthy children, though most patients are between 20 and 40 years of age. Men are affected approximately twice as frequently as women. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia has been associated with smoking. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia occurs more frequently in women than men and does not appear to be related to smoking. An association with radiation for breast cancer has been described. = History = Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia was first described by Carrington in 1969, and it is also known as Carrington syndrome. Prior to that, eosinophilic pneumonia was a well-described pathologic entity usually associated with medication or parasite exposures. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia was first described in 1989.

Unlike strictly logical approaches (which focus on the study of argument as product), or purely communication approaches (which emphasize argument as a process), pragma-dialectics was developed to study the entirety of an argumentation as a discourse activity. Thus, the pragma-dialectical theory views argumentation as a complex speech act that occurs as part of natural language activities and has specific communicative goals. The pragma-dialectical theory =Theoretical justification= In pragma-dialectics, argumentation is viewed as a communicative and interactional discourse phenomenon that is to be studied from a normative as well as a descriptive perspective. The dialectical dimension is inspired by normative insights from \\"critical rationalism\\" and formal dialectics, the pragmatic dimension by descriptive insights from speech act theory, Gricean language philosophy and discourse analysis. To allow for the systematic integration of the pragmatic and dialectical dimensions in the study of argumentation, the pragma-dialectical theory uses four meta-theoretical principles as its point of departure: functionalization, socialization, externalization and dialectification. Functionalization is achieved by treating discourse as a purposive act. Socialization is achieved by extending the speech act perspective to the level of interaction. Externalization is achieved by capturing the propositional and interactional commitments created by the speech acts performed. And dialectification is achieved by regimenting the exchange of speech acts to an ideal model of a critical discussion. (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 2004, pp.52-53). =The ideal model of a critical discussion= Based on the meta-theoretical principles described above, the pragma-dialectical theory regards argumentation as ideally being part of a critical discussion (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1984, p. 17). The ideal model of a critical discussion treats argumentative discourse as a discussion in which argumentation is directed at the reasonable resolution of a difference of opinion. The ideal model can serve as a heuristic as well as a critical tool: it respectively constitutes an instrument for the argumentation analyst when deciding about the communicative functions of speech acts and provides a standard for argument evaluation (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1992, p.36). Discussion stages In this ideal model of a critical discussion, four discussion stages are distinguished that the discussion parties have to go through to resolve their difference of opinion: the confrontation stage, opening stage, argumentation stage and concluding stage (see Van Eemeren & Grootendorst, 1984, pp.85-88; 1992, pp.34-35; 2004, pp.59-62). In the confrontation stage, the interlocutors establish that they have a difference of opinion. In the opening stage, they decide to resolve this difference of opinion. The interlocutors determine their points of departure: they agree upon the rules of the discussion and establish which propositions they can use in their argumentation. In the argumentation stage, the protagonist defends his/her standpoint by putting forward arguments to counter the antagonist's objections or doubt. In the concluding stage, the discussion parties evaluate to what extent their initial difference of opinion has been resolved and in whose favor. The model also defines the nature and distribution of the speech acts that play a constructive part in the various stages of the resolution process. Rules for a critical discussion The ideal model stipulates ten rules that apply to an argumentative discussion. Violations of the discussion rules are said to frustrate the reasonable resolution of the difference of opinion and they are therefore considered as fallacies. The ten rules (see Van Eemeren, Grootendorst & Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, pp.182-183): :# Freedom rule Parties must not prevent each other from advancing standpoints or from casting doubt on standpoints. :# Burden of proof rule A party that advances a standpoint is obliged to defend it if asked by the other party to do so. :# Standpoint rule A party's attack on a standpoint must relate to the standpoint that has indeed been advanced by the other party. :# Relevance rule A party may defend a standpoint only by advancing argumentation relating to that standpoint. :# Unexpressed premise rule A party may not deny premise that he or she has left implicit or falsely present something as a premise that has been left unexpressed by the other party. :# Starting point rule A party may not falsely present a premise as an accepted starting point nor deny a premise representing an accepted starting point. :# Argument scheme rule A party may not regard a standpoint as conclusively defended if the defense does not take place by means of an appropriate argumentation scheme that is correctly applied. :# Validity rule A party may only use arguments in its argumentation that are logically valid or capable of being made logically valid by making explicit one or more unexpressed premises. :# Closure rule A failed defense of a standpoint must result in the party that put forward the standpoint retracting it and a conclusive defense of the standpoint must result in the other party retracting its doubt about the standpoint. :# Usage rule A party must not use formulations that are insufficiently clear or confusingly ambiguous and a party must interpret the other party's formulations as carefully and accurately as possible. =Strategic maneuvering= Recently, the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation has incorporated insights from rhetoric into the analysis of argumentative discussion (Van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 2002; 2006). Parties involved in a difference of opinion \\"maneuver strategically\\" to simultaneously realize their dialectical and their rhetorical aims. In other words, the parties in an argumentative discussion attempt to be persuasive (have their standpoint accepted) while observing the critical standards for argumentative discourse. In each of the critical discussion stages there is a rhetorical goal that corresponds with the dialectical goal and interlocutors can make use of three analytical aspects to balance effectiveness and reasonableness: making an opportune selection from the topical potential available at the stage concerned, approaching the audience effectively, and carefully exploiting presentational means. These three aspects correspond with some focal points of rhetorical study ‚Äì topics, audience adaptation and presentational devices ‚Äì so that insights acquired in rhetoric are brought to bear in explaining how rhetorical and dialectical considerations play a part in the various ways of strategic maneuvering. Analyzing and evaluating argumentative discourse From a pragma-dialectical perspective, in order to get an overview of those aspects in argumentative discourse that are crucial for resolving a difference of opinion, the following analytical operations are carried out: :# Determining the points at issue; :# Recognizing the positions the parties adopt; :# Identifying the explicit and implicit arguments; :# Analyzing the argumentation structure. An analytical overview shows the differences of opinion, the distribution of dialectical roles, the expressed and unexpressed premises that make up the argument, and the argumentation structure (the relationship between a series of arguments presented to defend a standpoint) (see Snoeck Henkemans, 1992). The analytical overview can have critical or heuristic functions. =Critical function= Starting from the analytical overview, the evaluation of the quality of the argumentative discourse can be performed. In evaluating the arguments that are put forward in the argumentative discourse, the analyst should (1) check whether the discourse is free from logical and pragmatic inconsistencies, (2) determine whether the propositions put forward are acceptable, (3) evaluate whether the argumentation (can be made) logically valid, (4) check whether the argumentation schemes are appropriately applied, and (5) check for other fallacies. =Heuristic function= The concept of the analytical overview can also be used in argument production. Since the analytical overview brings together concisely all the information necessary for evaluating an argumentative discussion, it can be used to check whether the argumentation can stand up to criticism. If weaknesses are found, the argumentation can be adjusted or expanded thus it makes a useful guide for the creation of written or oral argumentation. Application of the pragma- dialectical theory The pragma-dialectical theory has been applied to understand several different types of argumentative discourse. For example, it has been used to analyze and evaluate legal argumentation, mediation, negotiation, (parliamentary) debate, interpersonal argumentation, political argumentation, health communication and visual argumentation (see, e.g., Van Eemeren (Ed.), 2002).

Given in pawn several times, Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg finally granted Sommerfeld with Lower Lusatia to the Silesian Piast duke Bolko II the Small. In 1364, Bolko II granted new privileges to the town.Krystyna Pieradzka, Historyczny rozw√≥j zachodniej granicy Dolnego ≈ölƒÖska do poczƒÖtku czas√≥w nowo≈ºytnych, \\"PrzeglƒÖd Zachodni\\", No. 7-8/1948, p. 63 (in Polish) After Bolko's death in 1368 it was seized as a reverted fief by the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. In 1411, Czech King Wenceslaus IV granted the town the privilege of minting coins. In 1429, the Hussites invaded the town. During the war of the succession of the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w, the town returned under Polish rule and in 1464 it paid homage and swore allegiance to Piast Duke John II the Mad.Pieradzka, Op. cit., p. 64 Renaissance Town Hall When the Brandenburg Elector Albert III Achilles of Hohenzollern acquired the nearby Silesian towns of Krossen (Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie) and Z√ºllichau (Sulech√≥w) in 1482, the adjacent Sommerfeld area too came into the possession of Brandenburg and was incorporated into the Neumark district. At the time, the town and the surrounding area were inhabited mainly by Slavonic Sorbs. In 1496 and 1597 the town suffered from fires, and in 1527 1,100 inhabitants died of an epidemic. During the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national liberation fights in February 1813, Polish uhlans quartered in the town. From 1816 on the town belonged to the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In 1846 Sommerfeld received a station on the railway line connecting Berlin with Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw). From 1871 to 1945 the town was part of Germany. During World War II, the Germans established seven forced labour camps in the town. The town was captured by the Soviets in February 1945, and in June it was handed over to Poland in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. During the war the town miraculously survived from any severe destruction and artillery fire, thus its medieval Old Town and Market Square are preserved to this day. In the years that followed World War II the remaining inhabitants of Sommerfeld were gradually expelled and the town was resettled with ethnic Poles, expelled from the pre-war Polish Eastern Borderlands, annexed by the Soviet Union. Initially, the new Polish administrative name was Zemsz, however, it was later changed to Lubsko for unknown reasons. The name Zemsz is still used by some locals and historians alongside the current one. In 1947 the \\"Patria\\" cinema, and in 1964 the Lubsko Culture House was opened.

History  The medieval Glasgow Cross was located on the road between High Street and Saltgait. Its modern replacement was built to the south-east of the original location to aid traffic. The town's tron was placed on the steeple of the town house in the 1550s. The Tron Steeple, as it became known, still stands in Glasgow Cross, one of the few remaining pre-Victorian buildings in Glasgow. The area now known as 'Merchant City' was developed from the 1750s onwards. Residences and warehouses of the wealthy merchant \\"tobacco lords\\" (who prospered in shipping and, amongst other things, tobacco, sugar and tea) were built in the area. The district west of the High Street formed the historic backbone of the city, the development of what is now known as with wide, straight streets, vistas, and squares, marked the beginning of a process of aspirational residential movement westwards that would continue throughout the 19th century and into the 20th with the development of Blythswood Hill, Hillhead and the West End of Glasgow. Tolbooth Steeple. As Glasgow expanded in the 19th century to become the second city of the United Kingdom and the British Empire, the area became a working district of warehouses and home to the city's central fruit, vegetable and cheese markets. After plans to construct a ring road around the city centre were published in the 1960s the area fell into decline, with many of the buildings compulsorily purchased by the city council to allow for their demolition and the central markets moved to modern premises outside the city centre. However the road was never built and in the 1980s the decision was taken to revitalise the area and its historic buildings with the public ownership of properties allowing large scale redevelopment. The name 'Merchant City' was coined during this regeneration and was not used historically. Historically the area was called 'Trongate', 'the tron' or Glasgow Cross, 'cross' or simply by most Glaswegians 'the toun' or 'the town'. The Merchant City has been promoted and built up in recent years as a residential, shopping and leisure area, mirroring Covent Garden in the West End of London. To this end many new bars and restaurants have been established. This has been complemented with the building of prestigious new housing developments, often by restoring Victorian buildings. An example being the GPO Building development. Another important element of the area's transformation is high-end shopping, anchored by the Italian Centre, home to, amongst others, Versace Collections (the UK's first Versace store) and Emporio Armani. The Italian Centre was designed by Page\\\\Park Architects who are fond of including art in their architecture. Here the art is integral to the fa√ßades, but also features in the courtyard including a sculpture, 'Thinking of Bella' (1994) by Shona Kinloch. Recent shopping developments include Bang and Olufsen, Bose, Escada, Ralph Lauren, Mulberry and underwear and lingerie Agent Provocateur stores. The annual Merchant City Festival takes place in September attracting tens of thousands to the area with its multi-arts programme. In 2006 Merchant City was winner of The Great Neighbourhood Award from The Academy of Urbanism.  Festivals  Merchant is famous for their annual festivals. Merchant city festivals have a lot of different entertainments, including street arts, dance, live music, markets, fashion and design, comedy, family events, tours, heritage walks, talks, visual art, film, and children - families activities every year. Merchant City Festival 2017 was held on 22‚Äì30 July 2017. There were two great family events as Carnival Procession and Provand‚Äôs Lordship free Family Fun Zone. Among the highlights of the festival are carnival procession from Glasgow Cathedral , massed samba bands, a UNESCO music stage, the return of SURGE, the festival within a festival, a Street band ‚ÄúEncontro‚Äù and a celebration of street food. During the festival, the city hosted Hip Replacement, a family Dance-along screening of Moana and Indiana Jones, and the hugely popular live sing-a-long Massaoke.

It forms part of the Garnock Valley area and is about away from Glasgow, the nearest city. The Barony of Glengarnock is one of three baronies which together form the parish of Kilbirnie in the district of Cunningham which lies in north Ayrshire. The River Garnock flows through the village, but the name Glen Garnock applies more specifically to the ravine at Glengarnock Castle, some to the north of the village.  The River Garnock and Kilbirnie Loch The Garnock's Waters near Glengarnock Castle. The southern end of Kilbirnie Loch. The River Garnock runs through the village. It flows from the base of the Hill of Stake in a southery direction, traversing Kilbirnie and Glengarnock, and making its way to Irvine Harbour where it enters the sea. The source of the River Garnock is in the Muirsheil Hills. Kilbirnie Loch is situated nearby, however the River Garnock does not flow into it, although in the past it has been known to flood into it.  Social History  Glengarnock is a small village in Northern Ayrshire that took its name from the original Barony of Glengarnock, and the medieval Glengarnock Castle whose ruins are still visible some 3 miles upstream and north of Kilbirnie. The community consisted of a number of migrant workers from Ireland and Lithuania who were brought in to man the works and housed in the \\"raws\\", i.e., rows of terraced cottages. A significant community existed with a number of local shops and facilities but these slowly dwindled when the community moved to better housing in Kilbirnie itself and by the 1970s had declined to only a small number of local shops. One of the first libraries in North Ayrshire was formed by Mr William Rabey who opened a Reading room at the Steel Works.  Industry  The main employment in the village came, historically, from the steelworks which existed on the shores of nearby Kilbirnie Loch. This, however, has been closed and the site is now home to various small businesses. During the course of its life, the Iron Works there were owned by Merry and Cunninghame, Colvilles, and British Steel, finally closing in the early nineteen-eighties. In 1892 Merry and Cunninghame's interest in Glengarnock had finished and Glengarnock Iron and Steel Co. was formed. From 1900 to 1914 there were periods of trade depression and when war was declared in 1914 the plant was idle. The Ministry of Munitions instructed them to produce munitions for the war. David Colville purchased the plant in 1916. Perhaps the 1930s was the first time people started to leave; economic depression and the means test which had been newly introduced left a lot of people poor, so they moved in the hope of better lives elsewhere. Riots were breaking out at that time. In 1978 the works, by then owned by the British Steel Corporation, employed just 200 people. Staff magazines from the entire period have been preserved and are held by the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. These throws an interesting light on the period. Ironically some of the buildings of the old steel works still lie empty on the site and one of them even has the Steel Works War Memorial still on the wall with names of the fallen during the two great wars, who were employees of the steel works. Various industries and businesses are situated today at the Lochshore Industrial Estate and Glengarnock Business Park in Caledonian Road, and in the village itself. Transport Glengarnock railway station on the Ayrshire Coast Line serves trains between Glasgow and Ayr, Ardrossan, or Largs.  Religion The memorial to Glengarnock church. The Hebron Hall of the Plymouth Brethren. Note unusually the date and month on the 1921 opening stone. Glengarnock Church has now been closed and demolished although the Manse remains as a private residence. A memorial to the Church in the form of the preserved steeple has been erected in the village main street. It was formed in 1870 composed of people from Kilbirnie Beith Dalry and of course the local folk. It was original United Presbyterian becoming United Free and eventually Glengarnock Parish Church. When it closed a time capsule was dug up, containing items of the time. It is held by the Auld Kirk of Kilbirnie. Glengarnock also had a Jehovah's Witness meeting room as well as the \\"Hebron Hall\\" Plymouth Brethren assembly. Both have now closed. The Hebron Hall Plymouth Brethren Assembly was opened in 1921. Previously \\"Duffield's Building\\" had been used, a building across from the old Glengarnock School. Then as the Assembly was formed, they met in the Orange Lodge Hall before the present hall.

Mountains =Cheat Mountain= Cheat Mountain follows the western side of Shavers Fork from Thorny Flat in Pocahontas County north to near Parsons in Tucker County. This ridge separates the Shavers Fork valley from the Tygart Valley River valley. Its high point is at Thorny Flat. Another notable point is where the Staunton- Parkersburg Turnpike (present-day U.S. Route 250) crosses Cheat Mountain at White Top. During the American Civil War, it was home to the highest Union Army fortification of the war. =Shavers and Back Allegheny Mountains= Shavers Mountain and Back Allegheny Mountain are part of the same structural ridge that follows the eastern edge of Shavers Fork from Pocahontas County into Tucker County. North of U.S. Route 250, the ridge is known as Shavers Mountain; south, it is Back Allegheny Mountain. This ridge separates the Shavers Fork watershed, which eventually flows to the Monongahela River, from the Greenbrier River watershed, which eventually enters the Kanawha River. One notable high point on Back Allegheny Mountain is Bald Knob, one of the highest points in the state. Just north of US 250 on Shavers Mountain is Gaudineer Knob, which provides scenic overviews of much of the Shavers Fork Mountain Complex.

By the 1930s, much of the land was completely denuded. This led to devastating floods and fires of the remaining trees. In the 1930s, reforestation of the land began in ernest through Civilian Conservation Corps projects of the Monongahela National Forest. Climate The mountains in this area, particularly the Cheat and Back Allegheny, are notorious for their bad weather, especially in winter. Both record lows and record snowfall for the state of West Virginia have occurred here. Terrible storms and bitter cold are the norm from November to April, although it has been known to snow on the highest summits as early as mid-September and as late as June 7.

In 2007 the population was around 15,000. There are around 7,500 households including Thorpe Astley. At the 2011 census the population of the civil parish had increased to 16,850. Braunstone is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, giving a population of \\"two sokemen and four villeins\\". The village remained a small settlement (population 238 in 1921) until 1925 when the Leicester Corporation compulsorily purchased the bulk of the Winstanley Braunstone Hall estate. It is just outside the city boundary of Leicester, and the part of the old civil parish now inside the city boundary is also called Braunstone. This part of the parish, which contains a large council estate was detached in 1935 from the Blaby district and Braunstone Parish to become part of the county borough of Leicester, hence the present split. The use of the name Braunstone Town is more recent, and is an attempt by Braunstone Town Council to distinguish their village from the council estate of the same name. Braunstone Town is adjacent to the M1 motorway (junction 21) and is adjoined by the Meridian Business and Leisure Parks, and the Fosse Shopping Park and Grove Triangle retail outlets. Although the parish doesn't have a railway station of its own, Leicester station is close. Leicester PlusBus, is a scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving. History House on Main Street The Shakespeare public house The earliest dated human find recorded is a Bronze Age axe (about 1000 BC) found in 1893. Next came the building of the Roman road from Leicester, through the site of the Narborough Road South to the High Cross near Sharnford. It is also evident that the Vikings of the early or later period had settlements in or near Braunstone, hence the nearby names of Viking origin ‚Äì Lubbesthorpe, Countesthorpe, Enderby, Elmesthorpe, Cosby, Kilby, Kirby etc. Throughout the above period Braunstone was covered with forest as were most county areas surrounding ‚Äì in what was known as Leicester Forest. But like most forests these were composed of a series of large woods containing small early settlements or hamlets inter-connected by rough trackways ‚Äì from which most of our public field paths owe their origin. Braunstone is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086 AD) where it is referred to as BRANTESTONE or BRANSTUN > \\"Braunstone ‚Äì six plough lands, all but for oxgangs, in Braunstone which is > the reign of The Confessor had been valued at twenty shillings, were worth > sixty shillings at the general survey and were then held by the son of > Robert Burdet. The land was equal to four ploughs, one was in Demesne, and > four Bondmen; and two socmen and five villains, with one border, had two > ploughs. There was a wood five furlongs long and three broad, and there were > of meadow. Two socmen abiding in Braunstone had five oxgangs of land in > Lubbesthorpe; and jointly with ten villains and six borders in that lordship > had two ploughs and five ploughing oxen. The above lands were held by Robert Burdet under Hugh de Grandmesnil, one of William I‚Äôs most powerful barons. Notes: A ploughland or carvcate = about 80 to of land. Socmen = Scandinavian Villan = Peasant or serf. NOTE: A copy of the Domesday Book is displayed at the Civic Centre. The first Lord of the Manor was de Grandmesnil. At this time the village consisted of 8 households and was worth about 60 shillings. The Harcourt or Horecut family held the over-riding interest in the estate from the 13th to the 16th Century. A survey taken in 1299 showed a growth to 24 households in the village. The fourteenth century saw several outbreaks of the Black Death in the area. Its effect on Braunstone is not recorded, but nearby Glenfield was seriously affected. At this time the Leicester Forest extended into Braunstone as far as Bendbow Spinney. Several portions of Braunstone were sold off in the late 16th Century. of arable land were sold to the Manners family in 1579 and a further went to the Bennett family ten years later. of land were converted to pasture in 1596 by the Hastings family who owned the estate at that time. Woodlands were gradually converted to pastures, mainly for sheep ‚Äì being then the more profitable husbandry. Leicester Forest was fully enclosed in 1628. Villagers of Braunstone were compensated for the loss of Forestry Rights. The 18th Century was a period of prosperity for Braunstone. The largest estate of the time was owned by Abraham Compton and comprised 68 ewes, 25 lambs, 14 cows, 6 heifers, 4 calves and 6 pigs. In 1750 James Winstanley III tried to sink a pit on the manor. His attempts were thwarted when his bore hole was filled with stones by intruders, thought to be from local mining districts. Rendezvous at Braunstone by Charles Loraine Smith In the 1820s Braunstone was known as a place to go fox-hunting. Charles Loraine Smith painted a set of parodies known as the \\"Smoking Hunt\\" which pokes fun at the fashionable sport of hunting here. Braunstone remained a village with various tenanted farmsteads until, in 1925, the Leicester Corporation compulsorily purchased the bulk of the Winstanley Braunstone Hall estate for ¬£116,500. Braunstone‚Äôs population rose from 238 in 1921 to 6,997 in 1931. In 1935 the part of Braunstone on the city side of Braunstone Lane became the North Braunstone Ward of the City of Leicester, and the parish of Braunstone in compensation had part of Lubbesthorpe added to its boundary. It mostly consists of council housing built between 1925 and 1940. During World War Two Braunstone Park was put to agricultural use. Wheat, barley, and potatoes were grown, and sheep allowed to graze. What is now the Memorial Gardens was used as a military camp, occupied first by the British Army and later by the American 82nd Airborne troops. After the war, due to the severe housing shortage, people were allowed to occupy the camp until they found homes of their own. By the 1990s, however, Braunstone was perhaps the most troubled part of Leicester, with crime rates and unemployment among the highest in the city. In April 1994, The Independent newspaper reported that unemployment on the estate was above 25% and was blighted by youth gangs engaging in anti-social behaviour. Braunstone Town Council The Braunstone Town Council is the parish council level local council of the parish of Braunstone Town. The Town Council was established in 1977 when the former parish council resolved to change its status to that of a town council. The Town Council has 21 elected members (i.e. councillors) who are elected for terms of office of four years. Braunstone Hall Braunstone Hall, c.1994 Braunstone Hall is a Grade II listed building in the centre of Braunstone Park. It was built in 1776 for the Winstanley family, lords of the manor and the main land owners in the village of Braunstone. In many ways the Hall resembles town houses like 17 Friar Lane. It is built in similar materials and has similar Classical proportions and decoration. But, while the Friar Lane houses were lived in by wealthy merchants and professional people or were used as town houses by landed families, Braunstone Hall was the centre of a country estate passed on through the Winstanley family from generation to generation. As country houses go, Braunstone Hall is fairly unassuming. It was not designed by one of the many fashionable country house architects of the day but by local builder and Leicester politician, William Oldham. He used red brick and Swithland slate, common local materials. The central doorway and windows are emphasised just as they are at 17 Friar Lane. Here they are set in an arched recess reaching up to the top of the facade. The Hall has a slightly less elaborate frontage to the Park at the back and, inside, Classical columns in the entrance hall and an elegant staircase. Building has always been a dangerous occupation and the building records show that a stonemason and a labourer were killed in the construction of Braunstone Hall. Around the Hall, the Winstanleys had a Park laid out with a lake and gardens. As a wealthy family they had horses and carriages which were kept in the stable block next to the house. These buildings did not share the refinement of the house and were more like farm buildings, but they were still carefully designed, with fine brickwork arches and decoration at the eaves. The walled garden, restored and beautifully planted by the city council, once contained fruit trees, serving the household both as a source of food and as a place to stroll. There are also reminders of the Winstanleys in the village. They commissioned one of the most famous of Victorian Architects, William Butterfield, to design cottages for estate workers at Cressida Place and in Main Street. Both groups of cottages were built in 1859. Butterfield modelled the houses on traditional buildings and used local materials but their design has a deliberate, thought- out quality which suggests that it was the work of an architect. The parsonage, built in 1864, and the village school of 1867, were paid for by the Winstanleys. In 1902 parts of the estate adjacent to Narborough Road were offered for sale as building plots.\\"Braunstone Hall Estate, Narborough Road: Valuable Building Plots\\", Leicester Chronicle, 11 October 1902, p. 1 Braunstone was greatly changed in the 1930s when the Winstanleys estate was bought by the Leicester Corporation, partly as land for new housing. Initially held by the Parks Department with the Hall being used as a junior school with over 600 places from 1932, the Hall and two acres of surrounding land were purchased by the Leicester Education Committee in 1939 for ¬£3,500, allowing the construction of an assembly hall and further alterations to the building. The Hall was used as a school until 1996, after which it fell into disrepair. In 2013 plans were unveiled for the restoration of the building and its conversion into a hotel, restaurant, wedding venue and conference centre. Now renamed Winstanley House, the hall operates as a hotel and wedding venue. St Peter's Church St Peter's Church The first record of a church is 1168: the earliest parts of the existing church date from the twelfth or thirteenth century. It is built of limestone and consists of a short square tower, nave and chancel. It was re-roofed in 1867 and had some minor refurbishment in the 20th century. In 1937 Braunstone became a parish in its own right, and St Peter's became the parish church with its own vicar.

Encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the brain that can cause minor symptoms, such as headaches, to more severe symptoms such as seizures. Mosquitoes serve as its carrier and for this reason this virus is known as an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus). California encephalitis virus belongs to the Bunyaviridae family of viruses. The La Crosse Virus from the same genus is also a common cause of encephalitis in the United States. Other viruses with similar disease symptoms but genetically unrelated include: St. Louis Encephalitis and West Nile Virus. Signs and symptoms The incubation period of California encephalitis is usually 3‚Äì7 days. An early symptoms phase of 1‚Äì4 days commonly precedes the onset of encephalitis, manifesting as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, lethargy and abdominal pain. The encephalitis is characterized by fever, drowsiness, and lack of mental alertness and orientation. Seizures occur in 50% of children. focal neurologic findings, like focal motor abnormalities and paralysis, irregular and abnormal reflexes develop in 20% of children. 10% of patients develop coma. The total duration of illness rarely exceeds 10‚Äì14 days. Recurrent unprovoked seizures occur even after the illness has passed develops in 20% of patients, especially those who had seizures during the acute illness. In adults, infection is asymptomatic, which means that the patient is a carrier of the infection, but experiences no symptoms or only mild feverish illness. The mortality rate is less than 1% and most patients with encephalitis clinical symptoms recover completely. Up to 20% of patients develop behavioral problems or recurrent seizures. Pathophysiology Initial infection by the virus and primary spread of the virus causes the onset of non-specific symptoms such as headache and fever. Secondary spread and the multiplication of the virus in the CNS (central nervous system) causes symptoms such as stiff neck, lethargy and seizures. It then can result in encephalitis, when inflammation of the brain, produced by infection by the virus, damages nerve cells, which affects signaling of the brain to the body. After the virus enters the body via a mosquito bite, the virus undergoes local replication at the skin site where virus entered the body. A primary spread of virus occurs, with seeding of the reticuloendothelial system, mainly in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. With the ongoing replication of the virus a secondary spread occurs, with the seeding of the CNS. Not all the cases reach this stage, depending on the efficiency of viral replication at the different stages and the degree of virus spread. The California encephalitis virus invades the CNS through either the cerebral capillary endothelial cells or the choroid plexus. Treatment Treatments are given to manage the symptoms the patient is having. In patients who are very sick, supportive treatment, such as mechanical ventilation, is equally important. Corticosteroids are used to reduce brain swelling and inflammation. Sedatives may be needed for irritability or restlessness. Acetaminophen is used for fever and headache. Anticonvulsants are used to prevent seizures. If brain function is severely affected, interventions like physical therapy and speech therapy may be needed after the illness is controlled. Epidemiology Factors influencing the transmission and control of arboviral encephalitis, in general, include: the season, geographical location, patient age, and the regional climate. There are approximately 75 cases reported per year. In the US the highest occurrence is in the Midwestern states, with most cases occurring in the late summer to early fall. Outdoor activities, especially in woodland areas, are associated with an increased risk of infection. History It was first discovered and isolated in 1943, from mosquitoes collected in Kern County, California. Two years later the first human cases of encephalitis were attributed to this new virus. Three cases in total were reported, and all three cases were in residents of Kern County in the Central Valley of California. In all three cases there was strong laboratory evidence confirming infection, due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies linked to California encephalitis. Since then, most cases of encephalitis have been associated with the La Crosse virus, and California encephalitis is a rare cause of disease in the Western World. The original California Encephalitis virus was isolated and put alongside fifteen other related viruses that are now categorized as the \\"California serogroup\\". From 1996 to 1998, approximately three times as many reported human cases of arboviral encephalitis were caused by California serogroup viruses than were reported for western equine encephalomyelitis viruses, St. Louis encephalitis, and eastern equine encephalomyelitis viruses combined.

Built in 1832, the original dam was a half-mile upstream from downtown Taunton. It was 12 feet high and constructed of timber. It was built of wood in 1832, and flooded Taunton when it failed in 1968.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/21/national/main961834.shtml The dam was purchased during the summer of 2005 by Infinity Holdings, a real- estate development company in the Boston area. Historically heavy and protracted rains fell on New England beginning October 12, 2005. On the morning of Sunday, October 16, officials realized that the dam was in trouble. The dam was determined to be in imminent danger of failure and of flooding Taunton with a 6-foot (1.8 m) wall of water. On Tuesday, 2000 residents of the city were evacuated and twenty-one troops from the National Guard were stationed in Taunton. School in Taunton was cancelled, and several roads were closed. Several high-volume pumps were employed to divert water around the dam and drain Whittenton Pond before a catastrophic failure could occur. Though the wooden dam held, later inspections uncovered extensive structural damage. (The Commonwealth of Massachusetts had last inspected the dam for safety and structural integrity in 2003.) After Whittenton Pond was drained, the old dam was demolished, and a new compressed earth and rock dam was built in its place. In 2008, the Whittenton Pond Dam was part of a study by the Massachusetts Riverways Program to review the feasibility of dam removals along the Mill River.Massachusetts Riverways Study 2008 Report The dam was permanently removed in 2013.

H. Davies (1871‚Äì1940). A large part of the book's subject matter describes the way of life of the tramp in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in the final decade of the 19th century. Publication history George Bernard Shaw had become interested in Davies, a literary unknown at the time, and had agreed to write a preface for the book, largely through the efforts of his wife Charlotte. It was only because of Shaw that Davies' contract with the publishers was re-written to allow the author to retain the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of fifteen per cent of selling price and a non-returnable advance of ¬£25 (equivalent to ¬£). Davies was also to be given a say on the style of all illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, Duckworth and Sons, refused to accept these demands and so the book was placed instead with Fifield. Shaw was also instrumental in keeping the unusual title of the book, of which Davies himself was unsure, and which later proved to be controversial with some reviewers. The book was the third published by Davies, having been preceded by The Soul's Destroyer (1905) and New Poems (1907). The 1920 edition of the book concludes with five poems selected by Davies from The Soul's Destroyer. The book was written in the space of six weeks, \\"a great achievement for a first book by a man with the minimum of education.\\"Waters, B. (ed) (1951), The Essential W. H. Davies, London: Jonathan Cape, (Introduction: W. H. Davies, Man and Poet, pp.9-20) In April 2013 Parthian Books published a new edition of the novel featuring Bernard Shaw's original introduction; it is part of the Library of Wales series, a collection of classic writing from Wales in the English language, a joint initiative of the Welsh Assembly Government and a Welsh Books Council. Background and synopsis Following a delinquent childhood and youth, Davies renounced his home and his apprenticeship with a frame-maker. At the age of twenty-two, having borrowed money from the executor of his grandmother‚Äôs estate, he sailed to America. This was the first of more than a dozen Atlantic crossings, often made by working his passage aboard a cattle boat. Between 1893 and 1899 Davies travelled the highways and railroads, tutored by hardened men of the road. He took advantage of the corrupt system of \\"boodle jails\\" in order to pass the winter in Michigan, staying in a series of different jails. These were jails in which a tramp could make an illicit arrangement with a law enforcement officer to stay in the jail without being an actual prisoner.Partridge, E. (1968), A Dictionary of the Underworld: British and American, George Allen & Unwin, p.62 Here, with his fellow tramps, Davies would enjoy the relative comfort of \\"card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk.\\"Hockey, L. (1971), W. H. Davies, University of Wales Press (on behalf of the Welsh Arts Council), p.16 Regular work was never an option and Davies subsisted largely by begging. After crossing the Atlantic one last time, from Britain to Canada, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush, Davies fell while hopping a train. His foot was crushed and his leg had to be amputated below the knee. He later wrote of the effect the accident had on his life: \\"All the wildness had been taken out of me and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking.\\" The book was praised by Osbert Sitwell for its \\"primitive splendour and directness\\", while Bernard Shaw himself commended the prose to \\"literary experts for its style alone\\", describing Davies as \\"the incorrigible Supertramp who wrote this amazing book.\\" Adaptations * In 1948 the BBC Home Service (now BBC Radio 4) recorded a potted version of the book over fifteen consecutive Sundays, beginning on 4 April. It was narrated by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. In popular culture On the official website of the British progressive rock band Supertramp, reviewer P. Robichaud credits Davies' book for the origin of the band's name.\\"Reviews\\". Supertramp.com: the official site. Chris McCandless renamed himself \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" when he began his journey in the US.

He announced his retirement due to persistent injuries on 10 March 2012. Career Born 11 September 1984 in London, Rees began playing rugby at Harriet Costello Secondary School (now The Costello School) in 1996. He also joined the youth team at Basingstoke RFC the following year. Under the guidance of Andy Bloodworth (of Chineham RFC) and Dave Luff, Rees progressed in the sport, initially playing in the centre before eventually specialising at openside flanker. Rees was eventually selected for England U16s, where he was awarded player of the year, and which led to his receiving offers from many Rugby-playing grammar schools: he chose to attend The Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe. Rees went on to play for England U18s and then U19s, being the first-choice openside flanker in both sides. He then signed for London Wasps on an academy contract, and after two years and having just broken into the first team, he was offered a first team contract, which he re- signed on a two-year deal. With Wasps he won both the Heineken Cup in 2007 and the 2008 Guinness Premiership title, scoring a try in the latter final. He returned to action on 27 March 2010 against Northampton, which ended 14 9 to Northampton but this followed wins over Gloucester, Worcester and London Irish. On 10 March 2012, Rees was forced to retire from Rugby on the advice he received after sustaining a knee injury. As of May 2020, Rees is a doctor at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital, having studied at Imperial College London. Representative career Rees captained the England U21 side in the Six Nations Championship but was not selected for the elite England squad for the 2005 autumn internationals due to a knee injury sustained during the 2005 Zurich Premiership semi-finals. Rees represented England A against Ireland A in early 2006. Rees had a string of injuries during the 2005‚Äì06 season, but on his return put in strong performances at Wasps and was granted his place in the full England squad after representing England at all age groups possible. Rees made his full England debut on 3 February 2007 against Scotland, coming on as a substitute for Joe Worsley. Rees started his first game in the 26‚Äì18 victory against France on 11 March 2007 and was awarded the RBS Man of The Match Award by Brian Moore. Rees also started the next game against Wales. Rees made his World Cup debut in England's initial group game against USA. Despite England under performing Rees was signalled out along with back Olly Barkley as two positives from the victory. Rees' second half try in that game put him second behind Nigel Redman as England's youngest try scoring forward during a World Cup Finals event. Despite starting in the following game against South Africa Rees failed to make another appearance during the 2007 World Cup. A thigh injury kept him out of the matches against Tonga and Samoa and during this time Lewis Moody claimed the number 7 shirt for the remainder of the tournament. Despite a supposed lack of form for his club side London Wasps since his return from the World Cup, Rees made Brian Ashton's 32-man training squad for the 2008 Six Nations and earned a place on the bench for the Six Nations opener against Wales ahead of other open-side specialists Michael Lipman and Magnus Lund. Rees' strong form towards the end of the 2007‚Äì08 Guinness Premiership saw him selected to travel to New Zealand to represent England in a two-test summer tour. He was then selected to start the first test at number 7 on 14 June 2008, a game which England lost 37‚Äì20. Despite England's defeat, Rees had put in a decent performance in that match. Rees was picked to start the second test in Christchurch on 21 June 2008. England were thumped 44‚Äì12; however, Rees again put in a performance he could be proud of against the standout openside in world rugby, Richie McCaw. If Rees' career had not been cut short, he exhibited the potential to make the No.7 shirt his own. There is no doubt the England management would have been compelled to recognise Tom's natural ability as a player and a leader, enhancing the national team's strength and solving the No.7 debate.

While the system is primarily intended for pen-and-paper role- playing games, variations of the system have also been used in live action role-playing games and miniature battle games. The system is named after the 6-sided die, which is used in every roll required by the system. System =Attributes and skills= Characters in the D6 System are defined by attributes and skills. Attributes represent the raw ability of a character in a certain area. Most D6 System games utilize anywhere from six to eight attributes, though these can vary greatly in number and name by the game in question. Acumen, Intellect, Knowledge, Perception, Presence and Technical are examples of mental attributes; Agility, Coordination, Mechanical, Physique, Reflexes and Strength are examples of physical ones. Skills are the trained abilities of the character and are associated with a specific attribute (e.g., driving, acrobatics, and climbing might be skills based on the Reflexes attribute). Each attribute and the skills under it are rated in values of Dice and Pips; Dice equal the number of dice rolled and Pips equal a one or two point bonus added to the roll to determine the result. The more dice and pips in the rating the better the character is at that skill or attribute. A character with a Strength rating of 4D+2 is stronger than a character with a Strength rating of 3D+1, for example. =Actions and resolution= Character actions are resolved by making dice rolls against a difficulty number. There are two types of difficulties, standard and opposed. To perform a standard difficulty action, the gamemaster calls for the player to roll the dice for a certain attribute or skill. The value of each die is totalled and the pips are added to the die roll to get a total. This total along with any GM or system imposed modifiers is compared against a target difficulty number. To perform an opposed roll action, the two parties involved (usually the player and a gamemaster controlled character) both roll their appropriate skills dice, total them and any modifiers and compare the results. If the first party's roll is higher than that of the second, he wins the contest and the rest of the result is resolved. If the second party equals or exceeds his opponent's roll, then the second party wins the contest. Wild die One of the dice rolled for each skill or attribute check or for damage is considered to be the \\"wild die\\", and is treated somewhat differently from the other dice. This mechanism was added in 2nd Edition. If an initial six is rolled on the wild die, then the die \\"explodes\\", meaning you add the six to the total plus re- roll the wild die, adding the result to the total. You get to keep rolling as long as you get sixes. If an initial one is rolled on the wild die, you disregard both it and the highest regular die from the total, often making you fail. Then you re-roll the wild die. If it comes up another one, a critical failure or complication occurs, usually with bad results for the character. Use of the wild die tends to make the game feel more cinematic. Improving rolls In order to increase their characters' effectiveness, players may spend character points and fate points. The exact number of character points that may be spent is limited by the quantity possessed by the character, and the situation that they are used in, with two being the typical limit. Each character point spent adds an extra wild die to one skill or attribute roll. A roll of one has no negative effect with wild dice generated from character points. Alternately, a character may spend one fate point on an action. Characters have fewer fate points, but the expenditure of them doubles the number of dice rolled on an action. =Variant resolution systems= Most D6 System games use the resolution system described above, which is sometimes called The D6 Classic System, though some variants exist. In one variant, The Legend System, instead of adding the die totals up, the dice showing 3, 4, 5 or 6 are each counted as a success. Use of a skill requires rolling a certain number of such successes. Pips are not used in the Legend System. This variation of the system was referred to, in jest, as \\"The D6 variant for the mathematically challenged\\" on WEG's own discussion forum. The Legend System has been utilized in the Hercules & Xena Roleplaying Game and the DC Universe Roleplaying Game. Other variants, such as those featured in the Star Wars Live Action Adventure Game and the Star Wars Miniatures Battles game, involve rolling a single six sided die and adding the result to a skill or attribute. This total is then compared to a difficulty number, as with the other variants. History =West End Games' early cinematic RPGs= A precursor to the D6 System first appeared in Ghostbusters: A Frightfully Cheerful Roleplaying Game, designed by Chaosium alumni Sandy Petersen, Lynn Willis and Greg Stafford, which was published by WEG in 1986.PETERSEN Sandy, WILLIS Lynn y STAFFORD Greg, Ghostbusters: A Frightfully Cheerful Roleplaying Game, West End Games, New York, 1986, The following year, Greg Costikyan, Curtis Smith and Bill Slavicsek reworked elements from the Ghostbusters game into Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game.COSTIKYAN Greg, Star Wars: The Role-Playing Game, West End Games, New York, October 1987, For a decade, West End Games published over 140 titles for the Star Wars Universe including a magazine, The Star Wars Adventure Journal. =D6 System standalone games= In 1996, WEG released The D6 System: The Customizable Roleplaying Game, written by George Strayton, which was the first core D6 System book not tied to a specific licensed or original property. Allowing total freedom to create any kind of roleplaying game through variation in attributes, skills, and every other game element all centered around the core mechanic of rolling six-sided dice against a difficulty number, the D6 System book shared as much in common with the role-playing game toolkit Fudge as it did with other universal systems like GURPS. WEG followed the D6 core book with Indiana Jones Adventures (a reworking of the earlier MasterBook setting) and the stand-alone Men in Black RPG. Another licensed game, the Hercules & Xena Roleplaying Game was the last title released by the original West End Games before their bankruptcy, as well as the first to use a modified D6 System based resolution engine that would later be known as the Legend System. A half-finished draft of a D6 System based Stargate SG-1 role playing game remained unpublished as a result of the bankruptcy. =Humanoids Publishing era= Following the bankruptcy, WEG was merged with French company Yeti, a subsidiary of Humanoids Publishing. Most of WEG's earlier licenses were terminated at this point, but the reconstituted company acquired another one from DC Comics. This license resulted in a new Legend System game, the DC Universe Roleplaying Game, which released a few titles from 1999 until 2001. As Humanoids Publishing was the publisher of the Metabarons graphic novels, they utilized the D6 System to release an RPG based upon that setting. Ron Fricke and former WEG publisher Scott Palter's Psibertroopers, the first licensed third party D6 System product, also saw release during this period. Humanoids began the process of releasing PDF format versions of many of the earlier WEG titles, converting some to the D6 System in the process. Humanoids released a PDF version of the Shatterzone Universe Guide containing an early version of D6 Space Opera. An initial PDF version of D6 Adventure was released as a rules lead in for the eventual re- release of Bloodshadows.D6 Adventure announced on the Yahoo D6 System group - registration required =Purgatory Publishing era= In November 2003, shortly after the PDF release of D6 Adventure, the WEG assets changed hands once again. The new owner, Purgatory Publishing, re-released the game in the form of three hardcover rulebooks. The rulebooks, each written by Nikola Vrtis, were actually three separate games. Each shared the same core mechanics, but utilized different attributes, skill sets, equipment lists and power systems. D6 Adventure, an expanded hardcover release of the earlier PDF, covered wild west, pulp, espionage, low-powered super heroes, and other modern or near modern games. D6 Space shared much in common with the earlier Star Wars line, and detailed space opera and cyberpunk game rules. D6 Fantasy dealt with sword & sorcery, high fantasy and swashbuckling campaign models. Khepera Publishing's licensed D6 System super hero game Godsend Agenda was released shortly thereafter. In 2007, WEG announced Septimus, a new standalone D6 System game with a setting designed by Bill Coffin and a rules system paralleling that of Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game. Near the end of the year, WEG publisher Eric Gibson tentatively announced that the D6 System would soon be adopting a free license.Free D6 At the end of the month of March, 2008, West End Games announced that the \\"Septimus\\" product would not be released due to cost issues. In August 2009, West End Games released most of the 51000 series of D6 book with attached OGL license officially classifying them and the D6 System as Open under the OGL v1.0. This re-release was in anticipation for a formal launch of the OpenD6 website portal and workstation, meant to aid publishers and players alike in creating, archiving, and searching the wealth of D6 rules and variants. Additionally, August 13, 2009, saw the long-awaited release of Bill Coffin's Septimus which itself was the first formal release of new material under the OpenD6 label. =Nocturnal Media era= In April 2016, The D6 System, together with West End Games, was bought by Nocturnal Media. The D6 books where made available on DriveThruRPG, and development for the system was mentioned. In 2017, The D6 System was licensed forward to Gallant Knights Games to publish a new edition for the system.

Technical Background Medwin's first patent (US 3,390,314) issued in 1968 when he was 43. It is entitled \\"Semiconductor Translating Circuit\\" and was assigned to Radio Corporation of America (RCA). His second patent (US 3,588,635) issued in 1971 and is simply titled \\"Integrated Circuit.\\" It was also assigned to the RCA Corporation. At this point, Medwin left RCA to start his own integrated circuit development company called Ragen Semiconductor. He received his next patent (US 3,789,388) in 1972, titled \\"Apparatus for Providing a Pulsed Liquid Crystal Display.\\" This was the first of his patents that was assigned to Ragen Semiconductor.

Many of the party's candidates have their own biography pages; information about others may be found here. Frank Ellis (Downsview) Ellis was a forty-six-year-old teacher and transportation consultant, involved with the firm . He supported a private-sector job- networking system, and a two-year freeze on tuition. He indicated that he was campaigning more as a \\"concerned citizen\\" than a Progressive Conservative candidate.Peter Krivel, \\"Subway lines concern voters\\", Toronto Star, 11 May 1995, NY2; Diane Francis, \\"Via Rail workers are the victims of \`dumb-sizing'\\", Financial Post, 15 October 1996, p. 15. He received 4,444 votes (19.19%), finishing third against Liberal candidate Annamarie Castrilli. Archie Heide (St. Catharines) Heide was over sixty years old at the time of the election. He moved to the Niagara Peninsula at age six, and later practiced in the area as a general and vascular surgeon. He was active with the Lincoln County Academy of Medicine, and with the district and provincial branches of the Ontario Medical Association. For eight years, he served on the advisory committee for the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Ontario. He is also an active Rotarian and a member of the Mennonite Brethren community. He received 11,486 votes (38.84%) in the 1995 election, finishing second against Liberal incumbent Jim Bradley. Heide was appointed to the Niagara District Health Council in 1998 by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris. Ironically, Jim Bradley announced the Liberal Party's support for his nomination at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Government Agencies. Richard Zanibbi (Sudbury) Richard Zanibbi is a health-care administrator and former police officer. After serving as deputy police chief for Nepean,\\"Shooting cost $1 million\\", Globe and Mail, 16 January 1985, M3. Zanibbi became the police chief for Sudbury in early 1985. Shortly after his appointment, he pressed charges against one of his officers who was accused of drinking and attending a Super Bowl party while on duty. Zanibbi said that he took this step in order to ensure Sudbury residents that he would run a force free of corruption.\\"Police partying on duty seen as blemish on force\\", Toronto Star, 21 September 1985, A6. He also implemented an affirmative action program, and in 1988 called for a decentralized, community-based approach to policing.Don Umpherson, \\"First native constable hired to ease Sudbury social tension\\", Toronto Star, 1 June 1987, C26; Timothy Appleby, \\"Toronto site of annual conference Chief backs decentralized policing\\", Globe and Mail, 3 May 1988, N14. In 1988, Zanibbi opposed a provincial plan requiring municipalities to provide security to Ontario courtrooms. Zanibbi argued that the extra security would be expensive, and would take officers off the streets.\\"Courtroom security plan outrages police chiefs\\", Toronto Star, 23 December 1988, A7. Two years later, he opposed the province's plans to create independent civilian commissions that would investigate charges of police misconduct.\\"Watchdogs not needed, chief argues\\", Windsor Star, 8 June 1990, A8. He later took part in secret negotiations to create a protocol that would exempt off-duty officers from investigation by such bodies.Andrew Duffy, \\"Deal limits probes into shootings by police\\", Toronto Star, 13 July 1991, A8. During the same period, he called for police to form a more effective lobbyist organization.\\"Metro officer wants police to lobby MPs\\", Toronto Star, 18 July 1991, F7. Zanibbi received 8,093 votes (26.64%) in the 1995 provincial election, finishing third against Liberal candidate Rick Bartolucci.

Joe Durocher (Windsor‚ÄîSandwich) Durocher was a high-school teacher and part-time farmer. He was originally affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada, and worked on a number of campaigns for federal cabinet minister Eugene Whelan. He was elected to the council of Sandwich West (soon to be renamed as LaSalle) in the 1988 Ontario municipal elections, winning the third of three seats in an at-large ballot. A rival candidate tried to overturn the decision on the grounds that Durocher had violated election rules by including pizza coupons in his campaign literature, but the challenge was withdrawn (Windsor Star, 15 February 1989). Durocher topped the polls for re- election in 1991. In 1992, Durocher initiated a motion on the LaSalle council endorsing the federal Charlottetown Accord. He wrote, \\"It would have been much more politically prudent to stay out of the referendum argument for fear of alienating voters. Instead, I chose to take a stand for no other reason than to serve my country\\" (Windsor Star, 30 October 1992). He sought the federal Liberal nomination for Essex in the 1993 Canadian election, but lost to Eugene Whalen's daughter Susan (Vancouver Sun, 5 December 1992). He had planned to the Ontario Liberal Party nomination in Windsor‚ÄîSandwich for the 1995 provincial election, did not file his forms. He later claimed he was prevented from mounting a serious campaign by local party figures who supported rival candidate Sandra Pupatello (Windsor Star, 21 February 1995). Durocher then joined the Progressive Conservative Party, and won its nomination for Windsor‚ÄîSandwich without opposition. He received 5,704 votes (22.51%) in the election, finishing third against Pupatello. He remained a member of the LaSalle council, and in 1996 brought forward a motion for the town to clarify the terms under which it could leave Essex County (Windsor Star, 13 September 1996). He may have left the council in 1997, and was no longer a member by 2000. He is running for mayor of LaSalle in the 2006 municipal elections.

Social entrepreneurship is an approach by individuals, groups, start-up companies or entrepreneurs, in which they develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.Enterprising Ideas, What is a Social Entrepreneur, PBS Foundation - \\"A social entrepreneur, in our view, is a person or entity that takes a business approach to effectively solving a social problem.\\" This concept may be applied to a wide range of organizations, which vary in size, aims, and beliefs.\\"The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship,\\" J. Gregory Dees, 1998, rev 2001 For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like profit, revenues and increases in stock prices. Social entrepreneurs, however, are either non- profits, or they blend for-profit goals with generating a positive \\"return to society\\". Therefore, they use different metrics. Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals often associated with the voluntary sector in areas such as poverty alleviation, health care and community development. At times, profit-making social enterprises may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in themselves. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the homeless may operate a restaurant, both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless. In the 2010s social entrepreneurship was facilitated by the use of the Internet, particularly social networking and social media websites. These websites enable social entrepreneurs to reach numerous people who are not geographically close yet who share the same goals and encourage them to collaborate online, learn about the issues, disseminate information about the group's events and activities, and raise funds through crowdfunding. In recent years, researchers are calling for a better understanding of the ecosystem in which social entrepreneurship exists, and social ventures operate. This will help them formulate better strategy and help achieve their double bottom line objective.  Modern definition  Grameen Bank founder and Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus (left) with two young social entrepreneurs (right) The concept of Social Entrepreneurship emerged in the 1980s and since then has only been gaining more momentum. Despite this fact, after decades of efforts to find a common ground to define the concept, no consensus has been reached Banerjee, S., Shabam, A. (2019) \\"Reimagining Social Enterprise through grassroots social innovations in India\\", in: Eynaud, P., Laville, J., Santos, L. D., Banerjee, S., Avelino, F., & Hulg√•rd, L. \\" Theory of Social Enterprise and Pluralism: Social Movements, Solidarity Economy, and Global South. London, England: Routledge. 3-17. doi:10.4324/9780429291197-1\\". The dynamicity of the object and the multiplicity of the conceptual lens used by researchers has made it impossible to capture it, in such a way that scholars have compared it with a mythological beast Teasdale, \\"What‚Äôs in a Name? Making Sense of Social Enterprise Discourses. Public Policy and Administration, 27(2), 99-119. doi:10.1177/0952076711401466\\" Scholars have different backgrounds, generating a great disparity of conceptualizations. These should be arranged in 5 clusters of meaning, according to the focus given and the conceptual framework assumed by the researcher. The first group of authors focuses on the person of the entrepreneur, being the mainstream definition. J. G. Dees argues that Social Entrepreneurship is the result and the creation of an especially creative and innovator leader Dees, J. G. (1998), \\"The meaning of social entrepreneurship, available in: https://entrepreneurship.duke.edu/news- item/the-meaning-of-social-entrepreneurship/\\" Social entrepreneurs can include a range of career types and professional backgrounds, ranging from social work and community development to entrepreneurship and environmental science. For this reason, it is difficult to determine who is a social entrepreneur. David Bornstein has even used the term \\"social innovator\\" interchangeably with social entrepreneur, due to the creative, non-traditional strategies that many social entrepreneurs use.David Bornstein, \\"How to Change the World\\" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 1, 92 For a clearer definition of what social entrepreneurship entails, it is necessary to set the function of social entrepreneurship apart from other voluntary sector and charity-oriented activities and identify the boundaries within which social entrepreneurs operate.Abu-Saifan, S. 2012. Social Entrepreneurship: Definition and Boundaries. Technology Innovation Management Review. February 2012: 22-27. Some scholars have advocated restricting the term to founders of organizations that primarily rely on earned income (meaning income earned directly from paying consumers), rather than income from donations or grants. Others have extended this to include contracted work for public authorities, while still others include grants and donations. Social entrepreneurship in modern society offers an altruistic form of entrepreneurship that focuses on the benefits that society may reap. Simply put, entrepreneurship becomes a social endeavor when it transforms social capital in a way that affects society positively.Alvord, Sarah H., Brown, David L., and Letts, Christine W. \\"Social Entrepreneurship and Societal Transformation: An Exploratory Study.\\" The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science. no. 3 (2004): 260-282. It is viewed as advantageous because the success of social entrepreneurship depends on many factors related to social impact that traditional corporate businesses do not prioritize. Social entrepreneurs recognize immediate social problems, but also seek to understand the broader context of an issue that crosses disciplines, fields, and theories. Gaining a larger understanding of how an issue relates to society allows social entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions and mobilize available resources to affect the greater global society. Unlike traditional corporate businesses, social entrepreneurship ventures focus on maximizing gains in social satisfaction, rather than maximizing profit gains.Baron, David P. \\"Corporate Social Responsibility and Social Entrepreneurship.\\" Journal of Economics & Management Strategy. no. 3 (2007): 683-717. Both private and public agencies worldwide have had billion-dollar initiatives to empower deprived communities and individuals. Such support from organizations in society, such as government-aid agencies or private firms, may catalyze innovative ideas to reach a larger audience. Prominent individuals associated with social entrepreneurship include Pakistani Akhter Hameed Khan and Bangladeshi Muhammad Yunus, a leader of social entrepreneurship in South Asia. Yunus was the founder of Grameen Bank, which pioneered the concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He received a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Others, such as former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith addressed social efforts on a local level by using the private sector to provide city services. Characteristics  Bill Drayton founded Ashoka in 1980, an organization which supports local social entrepreneurs. Drayton tells his employees to look for four qualities: creativity, entrepreneurial quality, social impact of the idea, and ethical fiber. Creativity has two parts: goal-setting and problem-solving. Social entrepreneurs are creative enough to have a vision of what they want to happen and how to make that vision happen. In their book The Power of Unreasonable People John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan identify why social entrepreneurs are, as they put it, unreasonable. They argue that these men and women seek profit in social output where others would not expect profit. They also ignore evidence suggesting that their enterprises will fail and attempt to measure results which no one is equipped to measure. About this, the Schwab Foundation says that entrepreneurs have \\"A zeal to measure and monitor their impact. Entrepreneurs have high standards, particularly in relation to their own organization's efforts and in response to the communities with which they engage. Data, both quantitative and qualitative, are their key tools, guiding continuous feedback and improvement.\\" Ashoka operates in multiple countries. Entrepreneurial quality builds from creativity. Not only do entrepreneurs have an idea that they must implement, they know how to implement it and are realistic in the vision of implementing it. Drayton says that, \\"Entrepreneurs have in their heads the vision of how society will be different when their idea is at work, and they can't stop until that idea is not only at work in one place, but is at work across the whole society.\\" This manifests through a clear idea of what they believe the future will look like and a drive to make this come true. Besides this, entrepreneurs are not happy with the status quo; they want healthy change. This changemaking process has been described as the creation of market disequilibria through the conversion of antagonistic assets into complementarities. Social impact measures whether the idea itself will be able to cause change after the original founder is gone. If an idea has intrinsic worth, once implemented it will cause change even without the charismatic leadership of the first entrepreneur. One reason that these entrepreneurs are unreasonable is that they are unqualified for the task they take on. Most entrepreneurs have not studied the skills needed to implement their ideas. Instead, they bring a team of qualified people around themselves. It is the idea that draws this team. Ethical fiber is important because leaders who are about to change the world must be trustworthy. Drayton described this to his employees by suggesting that they picture a situation that frightens them and then place the candidate in the situation with them. If they feel comfortable in this scenario, the entrepreneur has ethical fiber. One distinguishing attribute of entrepreneurs is that they rarely take credit for making change. They insist that the change they have brought about is due to everyone around them. They also tend to be driven by emotion; they are not trying primarily to make a profit but to address suffering. Muhammad Yunus says about this characteristic, \\"He (or she) competes in the marketplace with all other competitors but is inspired by a set of social objectives. This is the basic reason for being in the business.\\" Challenges Because the world of social entrepreneurship is relatively new, there are many challenges facing those who delve into the field. First, social entrepreneurs are trying to predict, address, and creatively respond to future problems.The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 86 Unlike most business entrepreneurs, who address current market deficiencies, social entrepreneurs tackle hypothetical, unseen or often less-researched issues, such as overpopulation, unsustainable energy sources, food shortages.The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 86-115 Founding successful social businesses on merely potential solutions can be nearly impossible as investors are much less willing to support risky ventures. The lack of eager investors leads to the second problem in social entrepreneurship: the pay gap. Elkington and Hartigan note that ‚Äúthe salary gap between commercial and social enterprises‚Ä¶ remains the elephant in the room, curtailing the capacity of [social enterprises] to achieve long-term success and viability.‚ÄùThe Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 201 Social entrepreneurs and their employees are often given diminutive or non-existent salaries, especially at the onset of their ventures. Thus, their enterprises struggle to maintain qualified, committed employees. Though social entrepreneurs are tackling the world's most pressing issues, they must also confront skepticism and stinginess from the very society they seek to serve. Another reason social entrepreneurs are often unsuccessful is because they typically offer help to those least able to pay for it. Capitalism is founded upon the exchange of capital (most obviously, money) for goods and services. However, social entrepreneurs must find new business models that do not rely on standard exchange of capital in order to make their organizations sustainable.The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; p. 200 This self-sustainability is what distinguishes social businesses from charities, who rely almost entirely on donations and outside funding.The Power of Unreasonable People; Elkington, John, Hartigan, Pamela; Harvard Business Press, 2008; pp. 31- History Social entrepreneurship is distinct from the concept of entrepreneurship, yet still shares several similarities with its business cousin. [Jean-Baptiste Say] (1767‚Äì1832), a French economist, defined an entrepreneur as a person who \\"undertakes\\" an idea and shifts perspectives in a way that it alters the effect that an idea has on society. An entrepreneur is further defined by Say as someone who \\"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield.\\"Peter F. Drucker, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (New York: Harper Business, 1993), 21 The difference between \\"entrepreneurship\\" and \\"social entrepreneurship\\", however, stems from the purpose of a creation. Social entrepreneurs seek to transform societies at large, rather than transforming their profit margin, as classic entrepreneurs typically seek to do. Social entrepreneurs use a variety of resources to bring societies into a better state of well-being. The concept of \\"social entrepreneurship\\" is not a novel idea, but in the 2000s, it has become more popular among society and academic research, notably after the publication of \\"The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur\\" by Charles Leadbeater.Wee-Liang, Williams, John, and Tan, Teck- Meng. \\"Defining the ‚ÄòSocial‚Äô in ‚ÄòSocial Entrepreneurship‚Äô: Altruism and Entrepreneurship.\\" The International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal. no. 3 (2005): 353-365. Many activities related to community development and higher social purpose fall within the modern definition of social entrepreneurship. Despite the established definition nowadays, social entrepreneurship remains a difficult concept to define, since it may be manifested in multiple forms.Mair, Johanna, and Marti, Ignasi. \\"Social entrepreneurship research: A source of explanation, prediction, and delight.\\" Journal of World Business.no. 1 (2006): 36-44. A broad definition of the concept allows interdisciplinary research efforts to understand and challenge the notions behind social entrepreneurship. No matter in which sector of society certain organizations are (i.e. corporations or unincorporated associations, societies, associations or cooperatives), social entrepreneurship focuses on the social impact that an endeavor aims at. Whether social entrepreneurship is altruistic or not is less important than the effect it has on society. The terms social entrepreneur and social entrepreneurship were used first in the literature in 1953 by H. Bowen in his book Social Responsibilities of the Businessman.For example, the phrase was used as a description of Howard Bowen, Social Responsibilities of the Businessman, America, 1953 The terms came into widespread use in the 1980s and 1990s, promoted by Bill Drayton, Charles Leadbeater, and others.'The Rise of the Social Entrepreneur, Demos, London, 1996 From the 1950s to the 1990s, the politician Michael Young was a leading promoter of social entrepreneurship and in the 1980s, he was described by Professor Daniel Bell at Harvard University as the \\"world's most successful entrepreneur of social enterprises\\". Young created more than sixty new organizations worldwide, including the School for Social Entrepreneurs (SSE) which exists in the UK, Australia, and Canada and which supports individuals to realize their potential and to establish, scale, and sustain, social enterprises and social businesses. Another notable British social entrepreneur is Andrew Mawson OBE, who was given a peerage in 2007 because of his urban regeneration work including the Bromley by Bow Centre in East London. Although the terms are relatively new, social entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship may be found throughout history. A list of a few noteworthy people whose work exemplifies the modern definition of \\"social entrepreneurship\\" includes Florence Nightingale, founder of the first nursing school and developer of modern nursing practices; Robert Owen, founder of the cooperative movement; and Vinoba Bhave, founder of India's Land Gift Movement. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some of the most successful social entrepreneurs straddled the civic, governmental and business worlds. These pioneers promoted new ideas that were taken up by mainstream public services in welfare, schools and health care. Ecosystem of Social Entrepreneurship  The ecosystem framework can be very useful for social entrepreneurs in formulating their strategy. The need for understanding the ecosystem of social enterprises has been increasingly felt as researchers emphasize on the importance of contextual factors supporting and constraining social ventures. Researcher note that there is a need to understand the ecosystems of social enterprises, as they often operate in a context which is highly localized, interacting with small, local actors, but may also be intimately connected to other systems operating at a broader (regional, country level or even global) level which influence their immediate environment. Many researchers such as P. N. Bloom and J. G. Dees attempted to develop an ecosystem model for social entrepreneurs. The ecosystem model proposed by them comprises of all the actors operating in the ecosystem, as well as the larger environment the laws, policies, social norms, demographic trends, and cultural institutions within which the actors play. Similarly, Dees et al. (2008) developed a framework to describe the key elements of the social entrepreneurship ecosystem in which they organized the elements into two broad categories ‚Äì capital infrastructure and context-setting factors. More recently in 2020, Debapratim Purkayastha, T. Tripathy and B. Das extended the business ecosystem literature to the social policy and social entrepreneurship arena. They developed a comprehensive ecosystem model in the context of the Indian microfinance sector that can be also used by other social enterprises as a framework to understand their own ecosystem and formulate their strategy. The researchers define the ecosystem as consisting of ‚Äúthe complex and evolving network of the focal organization (social enterprise) and all other individuals and organizations that the focal organization interact with including competitors, suppliers, complementors, customers, beneficiaries, regulators, resource providers, etc. that directly or indirectly influence each other; their interactions, as also the immediate and the broader environment (economic, social, political, etc.) the organization is influenced by and reside in‚Äù. The model helps identify all the actors in the complex ecosystem, the capital infrastructure and the context- setting factors.  2000s  = Major organizations = A panel discusses social entrepreneurship in the health care sector in 2015. Groups focused on social entrepreneurship may be divided into several categories: community- based enterprises, socially responsible enterprises, social services industry professionals, and socio-economic enterprises. Community-based enterprises are based on the social ventures aimed at and involving an entire community. These enterprises build on the community's culture and capital (e.g., volunteer resources, financing, in-kind donations, etc.) to empower the enterprise and the community. Socially responsible enterprises focus on creating sustainable development through their inside organization acts that focus mostly on creating societal gains for the community. Social service industry professionals such as social workers and public health nurses work in social services, either for a government or a non-profit organization. They aim to expand social capital for individuals, communities, and organizations. Socio- economic enterprises include corporations that balance earning profits with nonprofit goals, such as seeking social change for communities. Some social entrepreneurship organizations are not enterprises in a business sense; instead, they may be charities, non-profit organizations or voluntary sector organizations. In addition, there are support organizations dedicated to empowering social entrepreneurs, connecting them with mentors, strengthening their enterprise models, and preparing them for capital investments. These incubators and accelerator organizations provide office and meeting space (often free), mentoring and coaching for social enterprise founders and leaders to help them develop their enterprises by improving the effectiveness of their business model, marketing, and strategy. Some accelerator organizations help social entrepreneur leaders to scale up their organization, either by taking it from a local scale to a national scale or from a national scale to a global scale. Some entrepreneurship support organizations also provide mentoring and coaching to social entrepreneurs. One well-known social entrepreneur from South Asia is Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in 1976. He is known as the \\"father of microcredit,\\" and established the microfinance movement, which aims to help millions of people rural communities to access small loans. For his work, he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. The work that Yunus did through Grameen Bank has been described as a major influence on later social entrepreneurs. Larger countries in Europe and South America have tended to work more closely with public organizations at both the national and local level. =Types = In The Power of Unreasonable People, John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan describe social entrepreneurs' business structures as falling under three different models, applicable in different situations and economic climates: # Leveraged non-profit: This business model leverages financial and other resources in an innovative way to respond to social needs.The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 31 # Hybrid non-profit: This organizational structure can take a variety of forms, but is distinctive because the hybrid non-profit is willing to use profit from some activities to sustain its other operations which have a social or community purpose. Hybrid non-profits are often created to deal with government failures or market failures, as they generate revenue to sustain the operation without requiring loans, grants, and other forms of traditional funding.The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg.37 # Social business venture: These models are set up as businesses that are designed to create change through social means. Social business ventures evolved through a lack of funding. Social entrepreneurs in this situation were forced to become for- profit ventures, because loans and equity financing are hard to get for social businesses.The Power of Unreasonable People, 2008. pg. 42 There are also a broader range of hybrid profit models, where a conventional business invests some portion of its profits on socially, culturally or environmentally beneficial activities. The term \\"Philanthropreneurship\\" has been applied to this type of activity. Corporate employees can also engage in social entrepreneurship, which may or may not be officially sanctioned by the company. This has been described as corporate social entrepreneurship.Hemingway, Christine A. Corporate Social Entrepreneurship: Integrity Within. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013. pg.135 . One private foundation has staked the ground of more precise lexicon following the Newman's Own model having coined the phrase \\"Commercial Philanthropy\\" where commercial businesses are held and operated with all net proceeds going to serve social service needs.Foundation for Commercial Philanthropy, Inc. International presence Organizations such as the Skoll Foundation, the Omidyar Network, the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, Tasamy, Athgo, New Profit Inc., National Social Entrepreneurship Forum, Echoing Green, and the Global Social Benefit Institute among others, promote and providing resources to advance the initiatives of social entrepreneurs. The North American organizations tend to have a strongly individualistic stance focused on a handful of exceptional leaders. For example, The Skoll Foundation, created by eBay's first president, Jeff Skoll, makes capacity-building \\"mezzanine level\\" grants to social entrepreneurial organizations that already have reached a certain level of effectiveness. Role of technology The Internet, social networking websites and social media have been pivotal resources for the success and collaboration of many social entrepreneurs.Malecki, E. J. (1997). Technology and economic development: the dynamics of local, regional, and national change. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Academy in Entrepreneurship. In the 2000s, the Internet has become especially useful in disseminating information to a wide range of like- minded supporters in short amounts of time, even if these individuals are geographically dispersed. In addition, the Internet allows for the pooling of design resources using open source principles. Using wiki models or crowdsourcing approaches, for example, a social entrepreneur organization can get hundreds of people from across a country (or from multiple countries) to collaborate on joint online projects (e.g., developing a business plan or a marketing strategy for a social entrepreneurship venture). These websites help social entrepreneurs to disseminate their ideas to broader audiences, help with the formation and maintenance of networks of like-minded people and help to link up potential investors, donors or volunteers with the organization. This enables social entrepreneurs to achieve their goals with little or no start-up capital and little or no \\"bricks and mortar\\" facilities (e.g., rented office space). For example, the rise of open-source appropriate technology as a sustainable development paradigm enables people all over the world to collaborate on solving local problems, just as open source software development leverages collaboration from software experts from around the world. Public opinion = Controversy = Many initiatives carried out with social entrepreneurs while innovative, have had problems becoming sustainable and effective initiatives that ultimately were able to branch out and reach the larger society as a whole (versus a small community or group of people). Compromises in social initiatives were developed, which often did not reach large audiences or help larger communities. Since the concept of social entrepreneurship has been popularized in the 2000s, some advocates suggest that there needs to be some standardization of the process in scaling up social endeavors to increase the impact of these ventures across the globe. Policymakers around the globe may need to learn more about social initiatives, to increase the sustainability, effectiveness, and efficiency of these projects. Involvement and collaboration between private corporations and government agencies allows for increased support for carrying out social entrepreneurship initiatives, increased accountability on both ends, and increased connections with communities, individuals, or agencies in need. For example, private organizations or nonprofit organizations have tackled unemployment issues in communities.Cook, Beth, Dodds, Chris, and Mitchell, William. \\"Social Entrepreneurship: False Premises and Dangerous Forebodings.\\" The Australian Journal of Social Issues. no. 1 (2003): 57-72. One challenge is that in some cases, social entrepreneurs may only propose short-term solutions, or that they are unable to scale up their virtual, online organization to a larger degree to maximize the number of people who are helped. Government programs are able to tackle large issues; however, there is often little collaboration between governments and social entrepreneurs, which may have limited the effectiveness of social entrepreneurship. This lack of inter-sectoral collaboration may lead to stagnation, if the motives and goals of social enterprises and of those in policy-making and programs are not aligned.Drayton, William. \\"The Citizen Sector: BECOMING AS ENTREPRENEURIAL AND COMPETITIVE AS BUSINESS.\\" California management review 44, no. 3 (2002). Those in policy-making and the development of delivery of government programs tend to have different priorities than social entrepreneurs, resulting in slow growth and expansion of social initiatives. Since social entrepreneurship has only started to gain momentum in the 2000s, current social entrepreneurs are encouraging social advocates and activists to develop into innovative social entrepreneurs. Increasing the scope and scale of social entrepreneurship may increase the likelihood of an efficient, sustainable, and effective initiative; although it may also render social entrepreneurship more challenging. Increased participation draws more attention to social entrepreneurship ventures from policymakers and privately owned corporations. The increased involvement from corporations and governments may help to strengthen social entrepreneurship, as it may lead to policy changes and to the development of training programs and leadership development programs for social entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, research shows that as social entrepreneurs attempt to widen their impact and scale their efforts, external institutions will have a key role to play in their success.

It is estimated that 12,000 bears are farmed for bile in China, South Korea, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The bear species most commonly farmed for bile is the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), although the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus), brown bear (Ursus arctos) and every other species are also used (the only exception being the Giant Panda which does not produce UDCA). Both the Asiatic black bear and the sun bear are listed as Vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Animals published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. They were previously hunted for bile but factory farming has become common since hunting was banned in the 1980s. The bile can be harvested using several techniques, all of which require some degree of surgery, and may leave a permanent fistula or inserted catheter. A significant proportion of the bears die because of the stress of unskilled surgery or the infections which may occur. Farmed bile bears are housed continuously in small cages which often prevent them from standing or sitting upright, or from turning around. These highly restrictive cage systems and the low level of skilled husbandry can lead to a wide range of welfare concerns including physical injuries, pain, severe mental stress and muscle atrophy. Some bears are caught as cubs and may be kept in these conditions for up to 30 years. The value of the bear products trade is estimated as high as $2 billion. The practice of factory farming bears for bile has been extensively condemned, including by Chinese physicians. History Bear bile and gallbladders, which store bile, are ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Its first recorded use is found in Tang Ban Cao (Newly Revised Materia Medica, Tang Dynasty, 659 CE). The pharmacologically active ingredient contained in bear bile and gallbladders is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); bears are the only mammals to produce significant amounts of UDCA. Initially, bile was collected from wild bears which were killed and the gall and its contents cut from the body. In the early 1980s, methods of extracting bile from live bears were developed in North Korea and farming of bile bears began. This rapidly spread to China and other regions. Bile bear farms were started to reduce hunting of wild bears, with the hope that if bear farms raised a self- sustaining population of productive animals, poachers would have little motivation to capture or kill bears in the wild. The demand for bile and gallbladders exists in Asian communities throughout the world, including the European Union and the United States. This demand has led to bears being hunted in the US specifically for this purpose. Methods of bile extraction Several methods can be used to extract the bile. These all require surgery and include: *Repeated percutaneous biliary drainage uses an ultrasound imager to locate the gallbladder, which is then punctured and the bile extracted. *Permanent implantation uses a tube entered into the gallbladder through the abdomen. According to the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the bile is usually extracted twice a day through such implanted tubes, producing 10‚Äì20 ml of bile during each extraction. *Catheterization involves pushing a steel or perspex catheter through the bear's abdomen and into the gallbladder. *The full-jacket method uses a permanent catheter tube to extract the bile which is then collected in a plastic bag set in a metal box worn by the bear. *The free drip method involves making a permanent hole, or fistula, in the bear's abdomen and gallbladder, from which bile freely drips out. The wound is vulnerable to infection, and bile can leak back into the abdomen, causing high mortality rates. Sometimes, the hole is kept open with a perspex catheter, which HSUS writes causes severe pain. An AAF Vet Report states that surgeries to create free-dripping fistulae caused bears great suffering as they were performed without appropriate antibiotics or pain management and the bears were repeatedly exposed to this process as the fistulae often healed over. *Removal of the whole gallbladder is sometimes used. This method is used when wild bears are killed for their bile. It has been estimated that 50% to 60% of bears die from complications caused by the surgery or improper post-surgical care. Housing and husbandry Bears are commonly kept in extraction cages. Cubs are sometimes caught in the wild and used to supplement numbers held captive in farms. In 2008, it was reported that bear farms were paying the equivalent of US$280 to US$400 for a wild bear cub; this is equivalent to 10 times the monthly wage of a restaurant worker in China. Bile extraction begins at three years-of-age and continues for a minimum of five to ten years. Some bears may be kept in cages for bile extraction for 20 years or more. A bear can produce 2.2 kg of bile over a 5-year production life. When the bears outlive their productive bile-producing years (around 10 years old), they are often slaughtered and harvested for their other body parts such as meat, fur, paws and gallbladders; bear paws are considered a delicacy. To facilitate the bile extraction process, mature bears are usually kept in small cages measuring approximately 130 x 70 x 60 cm. These cages are so small they prevent the bears from being able to sit upright, stand or turn around. Some bears are kept in crush cages, the sides of which can be moved inwards to restrain the bear. The HSUS reports that some bears are moved to a crush cage for milking, but the remainder of the time live in a cage large enough to stand and turn around. Bile bears are often subjected to other procedures which have their own concomitant ethical and welfare concerns. These include declawing in which the third phalanx of each front digit is amputated to prevent the bears from self-mutilating or harming the farm workers. They may also have their hind teeth removed for the same reasons. These procedures are often conducted by unskilled farm staff and may result in the bears experiencing constant pain thereafter. Pathology reports have shown that bile from sick bears is often contaminated with blood, pus, faeces, urine, bacteria and cancer cells. Welfare concerns International concern about the welfare of bile bears began in 1993. Many bile bear farms have little or no veterinary supervision and the animal husbandry is often conducted by non-skilled attendants. In combination with the impacts of small cage sizes, their spacing and lack of internal structures, there are several indicators of poor welfare. =Physiological indicators= Elevated corticosteroid concentrations are a widely acknowledged indicator of physiological stress. Corticosteroid concentrations in the hair of Asiatic black bears relocated from a bile farm to a bear rescue centre fell between 12 and 88% over 163 days. Other physiological indicators of stress and potentially reduced welfare include growth retardation and ulcers. A 2000 survey revealed that bile bears suffered from sores, skin conditions, ectoparasites, hair loss, bone deformities, injuries, swollen limbs, dental and breathing problems, diarrhoea and scarring. One survey of 165 bears removed from a farm showed that (out of 181 free-drip bears), 163 (99%) had cholecystitis, 109 (66%) had gallbladder polyps, 56 (34%) had abdominal herniation, 46 (28%) had internal abscessation, 36 (22%) had gallstones, and 7 (4%) had peritonitis. Many of the bears had a combination of these conditions. =Behavioural indicators= Academic sources have reported that bile bears exhibit abnormal behaviours such as stereotypies, lethargy, anxiety, and self-mutilation.U.S. Embassy of China: \\"Bile Bear Report.\\" The Chinese media reported an incident in which a mother bear, having escaped her cage, strangled her own cub and then killed herself by intentionally running into a wall. =Longevity and mortality= Farmed bile bears live to an average age of five years old whereas healthy captive bears can live up to 35 years of age and wild bears for between 25 and 30 years. Legislation =China= In 1994, Chinese authorities announced that no new bear farms would be licensed and in 1996, issued a special notice stating that no foreign object was allowed to be inserted into a bear body. No bears younger than 3 years of age and lighter than 100 kg were to be used for bile extraction, and bears could be confined in cages only during the time of bile extraction. The authorities required the adoption of the free-drip method which necessitates the creation of an artificial fistula between the gallbladder and the abdominal wall by opening a cut into the gallbladder. In 2006, the Chinese State Council Information Office said that it was enforcing a \\"Technical Code of Practice for Raising Black Bears\\", which \\"requires hygienic, painless practice for gall extraction and make strict regulations on the techniques and conditions for nursing, exercise and propagation.\\" However, a 2007 veterinary report published by the Animals Asia Foundation (AAF) stated that the Technical Code was not being enforced and that many bears were still spending their entire lives in small extraction cages without free access to food or water. The report also noted that the free-dripping technique promoted in the Technical Code was unsanitary as the fistula was an open portal through which bacteria could infiltrate the abdomen. The report also stated that surgeries to create free-dripping fistulae caused bears great suffering as they were performed without appropriate antibiotics or pain management and the bears were repeatedly exposed to this process as the fistulae often healed over. The free-dripping method still requires the bears to be prodded with a metal rod when the wound heals over and under veterinary examination, some bears with free-dripping fistulae were actually found to have clear perspex catheters permanently implanted into their gallbladders. In addition to the suffering caused by infection and pain at the incision site, 28% of fistulated bears also experience abdominal hernias and more than one-third eventually succumb to liver cancer, believed to be associated with the bile-extraction process. =South Korea= In South Korea, bear farming was declared illegal in 1992. However, it was reported in 2008 that over 1,300 bears were still on 108 farms where farmers were hoping that legal farming would resume. , wild bears over the age of ten could still be legally killed for their gallbladders in South Korea. =Vietnam= The Vietnamese government in 2005 made it illegal to extract bear bile and made a commitment to phase out bear farming. In 2008, there were still 3,410 bears on farms in Vietnam. Alternative sources There are two alternative sources for bile from farmed bears, i.e. wild bears and synthetic sources. =Wild bears= Bile from farmed bears is considered inferior to bile and gall from wild bears. Implications for conservation Officially, 7,600 captive bears are farmed in China. According to Chinese officials, 10,000 wild bears would need to be killed each year to produce as much bile. Government officials see farming as a reasonable answer to the loss of wild bears from poaching and are insouciant about animal welfare concerns. However, the government's agreement to allow the rescue of 500 bears may represent a softening of this stance. A 2015 report indicated that the illegal trade in bear bile and gallbladder for traditional medicine is open and widespread across Malaysia and is potentially a serious threat to wild bears. In a survey of 365 traditional medicine shops across Malaysia, 175 (48%) claimed to be selling bear gallbladders and medicinal products containing bear bile. Some supporters of bile bear farms argue, \\"Wildlife farming offers, at first glance, an intuitively satisfying solution: a legal trade can in principle be created by farming animals to assuage demand for wild animals which thus need not be harvested.\\" Nonetheless, bears continue to be hunted in the wild to supply the bile farms. A survey in 2000 reported that almost all of the farms in the study supplemented their captive population of bile bears with wild-caught bears. This is claimed to be necessary because of difficulties with captive breeding. Consumers of bear bile have a strong preference for bile produced from wild bears; bile from farms may, therefore, not be a perfect substitute for bile from wild bears. Bear farming in Laos may be increasing the incentive to poach wild bears. A review of multiple types of wildlife tourist attractions concluded that bile bear farms had negative impacts on both animal welfare and conservation. Poaching in the United States In the late 1980s, U.S. park rangers began finding bear carcasses missing only gallbladders and paws. Initially, it was considered that occasional hunters were the cause, but investigations uncovered evidence that large commercial organizations were dealing in poaching and smuggling. During a three-year operation (Operation SOUP) ending in 1999, 52 people were arrested and 300 gallbladders seized in Virginia. Another investigation in Oregon led police to bring racketeering charges against an organisation that poached an estimated 50 to 100 bears per year for a decade. It was estimated in 2008 that in North America, 40,000 American black bears are illegally poached for their gallbladders and paws each year. =Synthetic sources= The pharmacologically active ingredient contained in bear bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). This can be synthesized using cow or pig bile, or even using no animal ingredients. The generic drug name is Ursodiol and it is now being widely produced under brand names such as Actigall, Urso, Ursofalk, Ursogal and Ursotan. It was estimated in 2008 that 100,000 kg of synthetic UDCA was already being used each year in China, Japan and South Korea, and that the total world consumption may be double this figure. However, many traditional doctors still consider natural (but farmed) UDCA a superior product. In Japan, UDCA has been synthesised from cow galls, as a by-product of the meat industry, since 1955. It is also produced in the U.S. by Ciba-Geigy. In 2014, Kaibao Pharmaceuticals, which supplies approximately half of the bear bile consumed in China, stated it is developing another synthetic source derived from poultry bile. Statistics =Wild population= The world population of Asiatic black bears decreased between 30% to 49% between 1980 and 2010. Although their reliability is unclear, range-wide estimates of 5‚Äì6,000 bears have been presented by Russian biologists. Rough density estimates without corroborating methods or data have been made in India and Pakistan, resulting in estimates of 7‚Äì9,000 in India and 1,000 in Pakistan. Unsubstantiated estimates from China give varying estimates between 15,000 and 46,000, with a government estimate of 28,000. Some estimates put the current (2015) total Asian worldwide population as low as 25,000. =Farmed population= The World Society for the Protection of Animals has been reported in 2011 as saying that more than 12,000 bears are currently estimated to be housed in both illegal and legal bear farms across Asia. China World Animal Protection conducted a study in 1999 and 2000, and estimated that 247 bear bile farms in China were holding 7,002 bears, though the Chinese government called the figures \\"pure speculation.\\" The Chinese consider bear farms a way to reduce the demand on the wild bear population. Officially, 7,600 captive bears are farmed in China. According to Chinese officials, 10,000 wild bears would need to be killed each year to produce as much bile. The government sees farming as a reasonable answer to the loss of wild bears from poaching. However, the government's agreement to allow the rescue of 500 bears may represent a softening of this stance. China has repeatedly been found to be the main source of bear bile products on sale throughout South-East Asia; this international trade in their parts and derivatives is strictly prohibited by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. In 2010, there were approximately 97 establishments in China keeping bile bears. In 2013, estimates of bears kept in cages in China for bile production range from 9,000 to 20,000 bears on nearly 100 domestic bear farms. One company (Fujian Guizhen Tang Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) alone has more than 400 black bears to supply bile using the free drip method. The bile is harvested twice a day to collect a total of approximately 130 ml from each bear per day. Before the existence of bear farms (i.e. pre-1980) the demand for bear bile in China was about 500 kilos annually. In 2008, the demand had risen to about 4,000 kilos annually. Korea In 2009, according to the Korean Environment Ministry, 1,374 bears were raised at 74 farms across South Korea. In Korea, it is legal to keep bears for bile and bears older than 10 years old can be harvested for their paws and organs. In 2012, the number of bears in Korean farms have risen to about 1,600. Laos In Laos, the first farm was established in 2000. The number of farmed bears tripled from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, there were 121 Asiatic black bears and one sun bear on 11 commercial facilities. It is possible that all the bears were wild-caught domestically, or illegally imported internationally. This is in violation of both National and International law. In Laos in 2011, bear bile was selling for 120,000 kip (US$15) per ml, half the average monthly wage of 240,000 kip. Bile products The monetary value of the bile comes from the traditional prescription of bear bile by doctors practicing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Bear bile contains ursodeoxycholic acid. It is purchased and consumed to treat hemorrhoids, sore throats, sores, bruising, muscle ailments, sprains, epilepsy, reduce fever, improve eyesight, break down gallstones, act as an anti-inflammatory, reduce the effects of overconsumption of alcohol, and to 'clear' the liver. It is currently found in various forms for sale including whole gallbladders, raw bile, pills, powder, flakes, and ointment. Examples of Bear Bile Products Seized by the Hong Kong Government Because only minute amounts of bile are used in TCM, a total of 500 kg of bear bile is used by practitioners every year, but according to WSPA, more than 7,000 kg are being produced. The surplus is being used in other inessential products such as throat lozenges, shampoo, toothpaste, wine, tea, eyedrops, and general tonics. =Efficacy= Scientific studies have indeed found bear bile to have anti- inflammatory, anti-microbial, and hepatoprotective effects. The active ingredient in bear bile is ursodeoxycholic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and protective effects in human epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been linked to regulation of immunoregulatory responses by regulation of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides defensins, and take an active part in increased restitution of wound in the colon. Moreover, UDCA's effects has been shown to have exert actions outside the epithelial cells. Bear bile has also been shown in studies to be able to get rid of gallstones by dissolving them in the gallbladder. Due to controversy around the use of bear farming to obtain bile, synthetic sources for ursodeoxycholic acid are currently being worked on and investigated. Scientists in China have been working on synthetic forms of bile products, so that scientists need not use animal sources for bile. In this way, it is hoped that in the future, bile can be created in methods that do not involve animal cruelty. =Cost= In 2011, the overall worldwide trade in bear parts, including bile, was estimated to be a $2 billion industry. Gallbladder In 1970, 1 kg of bear gallbladder cost approximately US$200, but by 1990 the price had risen to between US$3,000 and US$5,000 per kg. In 2009, the market price for legally sold gallbladders in Hong Kong had risen to between US$30,000 and US$50,000 per kg. A report published in 2013 stated that a poacher in North America can usually get US$100 to $150 for a gallbladder, but the organs can fetch $5,000 to $10,000 in the end-market once they are processed into a powder. The report also stated that the HSUS indicated a bear gallbladder can cost more than $3,000 in Asia. A TRAFFIC report estimated that prices for whole gallbladders were as low as $51.11 (Myanmar) and as high as $2,000 (Hong Kong SAR). For gallbladder by the gram, the least expensive was $0.11 per gram (Thailand) and the highest was $109.70 per gram (Japan). Raw bile and bile powder Raw bile can sell for as much as US$24,000 per kg, about half the price of gold. There is huge profitability in the trade of bile powder. In 2007, while the wholesale price of bile powder was approximately US$410 per kg in China, the retail price increased to 25 to 50 fold in South Korea, and to 80 fold in Japan, i.e. US$33,000 per kg. Pills Pill prices ranged from as low as $0.38 per pill (Malaysia) to $3.83 per pill (Thailand). and in the U.S., approximately $1 per pill, which is an average price between the two countries. Businesses In 2010, the Guizhentang Pharmaceutical company was one of the most successful bile extraction companies in China, paying some 10 million yuan in taxes. In 2012, the company tried to go public in the Shenzhen stock exchange and proposed to triple the company's stock of captive bears, from 400 to 1,200. This provoked a large response from those opposed to bear bile farming, and met heavy challenges from activists, internet users and protesters. This was followed by a number of controversies along with public interviews.

His early works include Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist (Walters Art Gallery), Cherub Playing a Lute (Uffizi) and The Infant Saint John the Baptist (private collection), all produced around 1521. In late 1523, Rosso moved to Rome, where he was exposed to the works of Michelangelo, Raphael, and other Renaissance artists, resulting in the realignment of his artistic style. Fleeing Rome after the Sacking of 1527, Rosso eventually went to France where he secured a position at the court of Francis I in 1530, remaining there until his death. Together with Francesco Primaticcio, Rosso was one of the leading artists to work at the Chateau Fontainebleau as part of the \\"First School of Fontainebleau\\", spending much of his life there. Following his death in 1540 (which, according to an unsubstantiated claim by Vasari, was a suicide ), Francesco Primaticcio took charge of the artistic direction at Fontainebleau. Rosso's reputation, along those of other stylized late Renaissance Florentines, was long out of favour in comparison to other more naturalistic and graceful contemporaries, but has revived considerably in recent decades. That his masterpiece is in a small city, away from the tourist track, was a factor in this, especially before the arrival of photography. His poses are certainly contorted, and his figures often appear haggard and thin, but his work has considerable power. Deposition from the Cross Descent from the Cross. 1521. Oil on wood. 375 √ó 196 cm. Pinacoteca Comunale di Volterra, Italy. His masterpiece is generally considered to be the Deposition or Descent from the Cross altarpiece in the Pinacoteca Comunale di Volterra (initially painted for the Duomo). In contrast to the frozen grief of other depositions, this one appears as a hurried and complicated operation, while the figures below have simple and forceful expressions of quiet grief, with powerful expressions hinted at by hidden faces. The sky is somber. The three ladders and those carrying down Christ appear precarious. Christ himself is sallow. Contrast this frenetic, windswept scene with the equally complex, but more restrained composition on the same theme by the near contemporary Florentine Mannerist Pontormo. Rosso would go on to paint a second, darker and more crowded Deposition altarpiece for the church of San Lorenzo in Sansepolcro.

Retail Traffic Penton Media. Retrieved on September 3, 2007. Mall developers consider Somerset Collection to be among the top privately held mall properties in the United States. Of the 100 most profitable malls, 76 are owned by real estate investment trusts.  History  Somerset Collection includes many relaxing water displays throughout the mall. In 1969, Saks Fifth Avenue opened a stand- alone store on Big Beaver Road in Troy, an affluent suburb 16 miles north of downtown Detroit. A one floor, upscale \\"Somerset Mall\\" designed by Louis G. Redstone Associates, was built onto the existing Saks, anchored by it and a new Bonwit Teller. Thirty five additional stores opened, including I. Miller, Abercrombie & Fitch, Mark Cross, and FAO Schwarz. Bonwit significantly renovated its store in 1988, only to close in 1990 after the chain went bankrupt. In 1991-1992 the center was renamed Somerset Collection, a second level was added, and Neiman Marcus opened a store on the site of the razed Bonwit Teller. Completed in August 1992, Saks was renovated and expanded and more luxury stores, like Tiffany's, opened as well.About Somerset: History and Information.The Somerset Collection. Retrieved on October 8, 2008. Following the success of the revamped mall, co-owners Forbes/Cohen Properties and Frankel Associates opened a new three-story $200 million, 940,000 sq ft expansion across from Somerset Mall in 1996, designed by JPRA Architects. Michigan's first Nordstrom and a Hudson's (converted to Marshall Field's and then Macy's) anchored the three-story expansion, named Somerset North. When Marshall Fields was converted to Macy's in 2006 Somerset became one of only three malls in the country to boast all four department stores. Connecting the two malls is a 700 ft enclosed bridge known as the \\"Skywalk\\" over Big Beaver Road. The enclosed, climate-controlled skybridge was one of the first of its kind in the country, featuring moving walks to move shoppers between Somerset Collection South and Somerset Collection North. In 2004, Somerset South, the original part of the Collection, was renovated. The mall features award- winning lighting by Paul Gregory (Focus Lighting), a continuous skylight, glass elevators, and fountains designed by WET. Somerset Collection includes several notable sculptures, including a Finnish Sorvikivi Floating Stone fountain. Mall at Millenia, in Orlando, Florida, also designed by JPRA Architects, was based on Somerset Collection and is similar in design. Neither mall has kiosks. In December 2009, the Forbes Company acquired an adjacent site on which an open-air mixed use development known as the Pavilions of Troy has been proposed. Although plans were approved, the project has not moved forward and no further plans have been announced. In 2012, calling it \\"strategic capital investments\\", Saks renovated its store after it identified the Somerset location as having \\"high growth potential\\". In 2016, Chick-fil-A opened a location in the Peacock Cafe food court, the first in Metro Detroit not at the food court of a college campus or airport. In 2017, Zara opened its first store in Michigan on the first and second floors of the Macy's wing.https://www.freep.com/story/life/shopping/georgea- kovanis/2017/10/23/michigan-zara-somerset-troy-store/789440001/ On January 6, 2020, Crate & Barrel closed.

It is known as one of the cantes de ida y vuelta (roundtrip songs), music which diverged in the new world, then returned to Spain in a new form. The genre originated in the 19th century in Andalusia, southern Spain, where Cuban music first reached the country. History Rumba flamenca was primarily influenced by guaracha, an uptempo style of vocal music which originated in Havana's musical theatre. Some elements from Cuban rumba were also incorporated, although minor, despite the name. Although unlikely, both guaracha and Cuban rumba might have been influenced by flamenco earlier in the 19th century. Guarachas can be traced back to the Spanish j√°caras, thus justifying the classification of rumba flamenca as a cante de ida y vuelta. The first rumba flamenca recordings were made by La Ni√±a de los Peines in the 1910s. During the late 20th century, Paco de Luc√≠a, together with percussionist Rubem Dantas, incorporated Afro-Peruvian musical elements such as the caj√≥n (wooden box) and certain rhythms. Terminology In term rumba as applied to the flamenco style stems from its use in Cuba to refer to Cuban rumba (originally, \\"rumba\\" meant \\"party\\"). Within flamenco circles, the genre is simply called \\"rumba\\", and other terms have been used to distinguish it from Cuban rumba, including gypsy rumba (rumba gitana) and Spanish rumba, which are nonetheless ambiguous since they may also be used to mean Catalan rumba or other contemporary styles such as tecno-rumba. Instrumentation The rumba flamenca instrumentation consists of flamenco guitars, hand clapping, occasional body slapping, castanets and the caj√≥n. As a result, it bears little resemblance to Cuban rumba, whose instrumentation is based on the congas and claves. Nonetheless, some artists such as Paco de Luc√≠a and Tomatito have included congas alongside their cajones in their ensembles, although with a minor role. Music theory In Cuba, the rumba is performed with multiple percussion instruments, playing in duple meter. The flamenco version of it uses palmas, guitar, and golpes (slapping the guitar). In addition, rumba flamenca has a particular guitar strumming pattern absent in other flamenco styles. The rhythm is a modified tresillo rhythm with eight beats grouped into a repeating pattern of 3+3+2. Unlike traditional flamenco, rumbas may be played in any key, major, minor and modal. At approx. 100-120bpm, the tempo of rumba flamenca is slower than other more traditional flamenco styles such as buler√≠as and fandangos. There are 4 beats per bar with an accent on the 2nd and 4th beats. Dance The rumba flamenca dance has some origins in Catalonia, specifically in the downtown areas of Barcelona, where gypsies performed rumba catalana at the times of this genre's flowering popularity. The dance that it accompanied was improvised with prominent hip and shoulder movements, more overtly sexual than other styles of flamenco dances.

Overview List√≠n Diario, was founded on 1 August 1889 by Arturo Pellerano Alfau and Julian Atiles, two successful merchants who endeavored to inform the general public of the arrival and departure of merchant ships into Dominican ports. Soon after, the one page List√≠n Diario Mar√≠timo became a broadsheet newspaper, printed out of the Pellerano & Atiles offices in the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo. The Venezuelan writer and poet Andr√©s Mata was its editor for a time.El Universal, Biografia , accessed 11 June 2012. Pellerano Alfau served as editor and publisher of the newspaper until his death in the early 1930s. During his tenure, List√≠n Diario championed some of the era's more significant regional issues, such as: Cuban Independence, from 1894-98, during which time it regularly published letters from Dominican General M√°ximo G√≥mez, who fought on the Cuban side; during the American intervention of 1916-24, List√≠n maintained a serene opposition to the intervention, regularly publishing articles and editorial columns written by the Dominican patriots. List√≠n's biggest battle of the first half of the twentieth century was against General Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo, whom it opposed during the first ten years of his mandate, and as a consequence, was financially strangled by the dictator, having to shut down operations for all of 21 years. Even before Trujillo was assassinated in May 1961, Pellerano's descendants started to plan the paper's revival. On 1 August 1963 -- the 74th anniversary of the paper's founding -- led by Carlos Alberto Ricart Vidal (married to Nelly Pellerano L√≥pez-Penha, daughter of Arturo Pellerano Alfau), together with Mois√©s Pellerano Lopez-Penha, Rogelio Pellerano Romano, M√°ximo Pellerano Romano and other close relatives, List√≠n Diario was edited again. Ricart Vidal was publisher from 1963-84, when he retired and gave way to Rogelio Pellerano, who served on that post until his death in 1993. The family tapped Rafael Herrera Cabral, then editor of El Caribe, another leading daily newspaper at the time, as the editor of List√≠n Diario. Herrera served from 1963 until his death in 1994, and is considered one of the most important editorialists of the Dominican Republic. List√≠n Diario¬¥s current editor-in- chief is Miguel Franjul. On August 1, 1963 List√≠n Diario reappeared after more than 20 years without being published. In the front page‚Äôs first edition it was published a message inspired in patriotics, civics and morals ideals wrote by the founder Arturo Pellerano Alfau. Also in the same cover it was shared a greeting by the Associated Press. In this new challenging beginning List√≠n Diario had 24 pages with eight columns returning after more than two muted decades. The new edition was planned by Carlos Alberto Ricart and his family in San Jos√© de Costa Rica in 1960 and when Dominican Republic had better political conditions and with Rafael Leonidas Trujillo‚Äôs death, Mois√©s A. Pellerano, Rogelio Pellerano (Tuturo), M√°ximo G√≥mez Peckham (J√∫nior), Gisela Pellerano‚Äôs husband; Juanita Pellerano and Nelly Pellerano de Ricart made a comeback reunion. This first editorial written in 1963 represents a mission for anyone on whom that responsibility rests. The compendium ‚ÄúCien a√±os del List√≠n\\" speaks of that this task was entrusted to Manuel Amiama, (Don Cundo), due to his vast experience as a writer and journalist, and for being a deep knower of Dominican journalism‚Äôs history, in order to give testimony of what the List√≠n meant for the country in 53 years of trajectory. ‚ÄúAqu√≠ est√° el List√≠n‚Äù, was the title of one of the most important editorial in Dominican history, in which Aimiama reaffirmed the impartiality that has List√≠n Diario since the first edition. Newspapers greetings In the 128th List√≠n Diario‚Äôs anniversary, different newspapers greeted it for the long and brave journey. El D√≠a said that this mission had being long, fructiferous and full of challenges. Reaching 128 years of work meant redoubling efforts, overcoming communicative and conventional difficulties until handling the modern tools of this century. Also mentioned that List√≠n Diario has a unique history in Dominican‚Äôs journalism and of all the papers it is the oldest, thanks to many factors, among them because it has been able to make important decisions through the years. Hoy describe that List√≠n Diario had run evenly, and sometimes ahead, with the challenges of the times. The thrust of digital media is an unavoidable challenge for print journals, and has not wavered before this reality, which assumes permanent innovations, good information and reading material, and through timely research on the topics more interesting for social plurality. List√≠n Diario‚Äôs new format On March 11, 2019 List√≠n Diario released a brand new tabloid format. The editor in chief, Miguel Franjul, explained that this one is more comfortable, manageable and attractive for the readers. Following the same route as the newspapers that have been referents of the highest credibility and acceptance in the world, the LISTIN DIARIO bets on its constant renewal, not only with the modernization of its design but with a new approach to discover the news under any of the possible scales, said Franjul. Also, mentioned that this transformation has been accompanied by heavy investments in technologies that make it possible to combine the printed editions with the digital ones, increasing the audiences extraordinarily, therefore achieving higher revenues off the monetization plans, through both platforms, in response of the progressive decline in the advertising of the printed platform. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre tuning in with the trends that mark the processes of renewal and innovation of this era, and still resembling the pure truth while also preserving our stamp of identity, which has been carved thanks to a history of 130 years of hard work and existence as a legitimate voice of the national conscience‚Äù, he told.

It links Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, former boroughs that were divided by the Berlin Wall, and has become an important symbol of Berlin‚Äôs unity. The lower deck of the bridge carries a roadway, which connects Oberbaum Stra√üe to the south of the river with Warschauer Stra√üe to the north. The upper deck of the bridge carries Berlin U-Bahn lines and , between Schlesisches Tor and Warschauer Stra√üe stations. The bridge appears prominently in the 1998 film Run Lola Run. The bridge also appears prominently in the TV Series Berlin Station. History U-Bahn railway station Stralauer Tor, c. 1900 The towers were based on the Brick Gothic Mitteltorturm in Prenzlau (video) A U-bahn subway train goes across the bridge on a cold day in December, 2014 The bridge is built on the former boundary of the municipal area with its rural environs, where an excise wall was built in 1732. A wooden drawbridge was built as part of the wall; it served as a gate to the city. The name Oberbaumbr√ºcke stemmed from the heavy tree trunk, covered in metal spikes, that was used as a boom to block the river at night to prevent smuggling. (Baum means tree or wooden beam in German; thus the name means something like \\"Upper [Upstream] Tree Bridge\\"; there was another tree-trunk barrier at the western end of the contemporary city limits, close to today's Unterbaumstra√üe (lit. in .) By 1879 the wooden bridge had been modified greatly. At 154 meters it was Berlin's longest, but was no longer adequate to the amount of traffic crossing it. Plans began to be drawn up for a new stone construction. The Siemens & Halske company, which was planning to build the Berlin U-Bahn (subway), insisted on a combined crossing for road vehicles, pedestrians, and the new rail line. The new bridge opened in 1896 after two years of construction, in time for the Berlin Trades Exhibition. The architect and government official Otto Stahn (1859‚Äì1930) designed it in the North German Brick Gothic style of a city gate with many decorative elements, such as pointed arches, cross vaults, and coats of arms. The two towers were inspired by the Middle Gate Tower (Mitteltorturm) in the northern Brandenburg city of Prenzlau. Although purely cosmetic, they served as a reminder that the site was once Berlin‚Äôs river gateway. In 1902 the first segment of the U-Bahn opened. Its inaugural journey, carrying 19 passengers, ran from Stralauer Tor, at the eastern end of the bridge, to Potsdamer Platz. Stralauer Tor was dismantled after being damaged in a 1945 air raid, but its four sandstone-clad support posts can still be seen. After Berlin absorbed several other municipalities in 1920, the Oberbaum Bridge became the crossing between the new boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. In April 1945 the Wehrmacht blew up the middle section of the bridge in an attempt to stop the Red Army from crossing it. After the war ended, Berlin was divided into four sectors. The Oberbaum Bridge crossed between the American and Soviet sectors. Until the mid-1950s, pedestrians, motor vehicles, and the city tramway could cross the bridge without difficulty. =Border crossing= East German checkpoint at the Oberbaum Bridge. Crowds at Oberbaumbr√ºcke after the breach of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 the bridge became part of East Berlin's border with West Berlin; as all the waters of the River Spree were within the Friedrichshain limits, the East German fortifications extended up to the shoreline on the Kreuzberg side. As a result, the West Berlin U-Bahn line was forced to terminate at Schlesisches Tor. Beginning on 21 December 1963, the Oberbaum Bridge was used as a pedestrian border crossing for West Berlin residents only. Three brief openings of the bridge occurred by the summer of 1966. A permanent opening for pedestrians came with the 1972 Four Power Agreement for Berlin. A building for the East Berlin control authorities was built directly on the eastern bank of the Spree, across the street from the Oberbaumbr√ºcke. The part of the subway viaduct crossing the Stralauer Allee at the bridge was completely demolished. The towers were demolished in the 1970s. Since the border on the Kreuzberg shore (Gr√∂benufer) ran along the Spree, several children from Kreuzberg drowned on the Oberbaum bridge because rescue personnel from west side could not reach them, and this was prohibited from the east side. Responding to this an agreement on rescue operations if accidents in Berlin's border waters was signed on October 29, 1975. In 1976, an emergency call column was installed on the southern bridgehead, after whose activation drowning help was provided. The coat of arms of the district Friedrichshain‚ÄìKreuzberg with the Oberbaumbr√ºcke The Oberbaum Bridge, which formed part of the Friedrichshain coat of arms since 1991, was also included in the coat of arms of the new Berlin district of Friedrichshain‚ÄìKreuzberg after the district merger. =Post-Berlin Wall= The U1 tracks at the end of Oberbaum Bridge in 1990, leading to the former Stralauer Tor station. The viaduct spans and blockade were demolished in January 1992 and the spans rebuilt for the reopening of the U1 line along the bridge in 1995. After the removal of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and German reunification the following year, the bridge was rebuilt and restored to the former appearance, albeit with a new steel middle section designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. Reconstruction began in January 1992, with the war-damaged parts of the bridge rebuilt. It opened to pedestrians and traffic on 9 November 1994, the fifth anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall. The U-Bahn line to Warschauer Stra√üe station was reopened a year later. Since 1997, a neon installation entitled \\"Stone ‚Äì Paper ‚Äì Scissors\\" by Thorsten Goldberg has adorned the bridge. Its two elements are engaged in a constant game of rock, paper, scissors, suggesting the arbitrariness of immigration decisions, both during the Cold War and for today's asylum seekers and poverty migrants. Since the creation of the unified Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg borough in 2001, the Oberbaum Bridge no longer crosses a jurisdictional boundary. In April 2019 the Oberbaum Bridge was blockaded as part of an international series of protests organised by Extinction Rebellion. The bridge was used as the location for the defection of Karla to George Smiley and British intelligence in the book and mini series, Smiley's People.
