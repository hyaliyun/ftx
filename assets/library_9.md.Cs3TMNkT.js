Born around 1564, he was the son of Helen Graham and her husband John Forbes of Ardmurdo. He graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 1585 from the University of St Andrews, becoming minister of Fettercairn in the Mearns in 1588, using this position to take an active role in the church politics of the day. As a result, on 22 November 1604, he became Bishop of Caithness, retaining control of Fettercairn, something which created animosity with the anti-episcopal section of the Church of Scotland. Forbes took part in most national church meetings in this period, and was part of the meeting at Glasgow in 1610 which restored the old authority and powers of bishops. It was in the following year that he was finally consecrated as a bishop, in Brechin Cathedral. He was alleged to have granted the consent of the Scottish church, dishonestly, to the absolution of the Catholic magnate, George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, carried out on the king's wishes by the Archbishop of Canterbury. It was perhaps for this reason that, in 1616, Forbes was translated as Bishop of Aberdeen. This position brought him the Chancellorship of King's College, Aberdeen. Forbes, however, attempted and failed to succeed George Gledstanes to the Archbishopric of St Andrews, a position he was beaten to by John Spottiswoode. He died at Leith, near Edinburgh, on 14 December 1617, a figure of hate amongst the hard-line presbyterian section of the Scottish church. He married once, to a woman named Christian Straton, and had ten children. References * Cooper, James, \\"Forbes, Alexander (1564‚Äì1617)\\", rev. A. S.

It is currently based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and operates as a subsidiary of Kendall Hunt Publishing.  History  Benziger Brothers token. The company started as a Catholic religious publisher founded by Joseph Charles Benzinger in 1792. In 1833, Benziger's sons, Charles and Nicholas, succeeded their father under the company name of Charles and Nicholas Benziger Brothers. Two years later, in addition to their book-publishing business, the brothers began lithographing religious pictures, as well as coloring them by hand, before the introduction of chromolithography. = Charles Benziger = Charles Benziger (b. 1799, d. 1873), a man with a good classical education, devoted himself especially to the literary end of the business. In 1840, the first Einsiedler Kalender volume was produced. The Pilgrim, a popular Catholic periodical established at the same time, lasted only ten years. Charles also took an active part in public life, and served as president of the Swiss canton of Schwyz. = Nicholas Benziger = Nicholas Benziger home in New York right Nicholas Benziger (b. 1808, d. 1864), who took charge of the technical part of the business, proved himself a pioneer, introducing to the mountain village of Einsiedeln a series of improved trade methods from the great mercantile centers of Europe and the United States. Under his guidance, the work of bookbinding, which was formerly undertaken by the family at home, was systematized. In 1844, the old hand press was superseded by the first power press. Stereotyping was introduced in 1846, steel and copper printing in 1856 and electrotyping in 1858. = End of 19th century = Upon the retirement of Charles and Nicholas Benziger in 1860, the business was continued by three of Charles' sons (Charles, Martin and J.N. Adelrich) and three of Nicholas' sons (Nicholas, Adelrich and Louis). Under this third generation, the different branches of the house were further developed, with chromolithography and other modern printing methods added. In 1867, the Alte und Neue Welt, the first illustrated popular Catholic German magazine on a large scale, was begun. A number of illustrated Catholic family books and a series of schoolbooks were produced, including a Bible history in 12 languages, together with prayer books by well-known authors. Between 1880 and 1895, a fourth generation took control of the business, and the firm name was changed to Benziger and Company. = Expansion to the United States = Although Benziger Brothers had established offices in New York City in 1853, the company's development as a publishing house did not begin until 1860 when J.N. Adelrich Benziger and Louis Benziger took charge. In 1860, offices were opened in Cincinnati and in 1887, one in Chicago. The publishing of English Catholic books was vigorously undertaken, and the company's catalog covered the field of devotional, educational and juvenile literature, as well as works of a theological theme. Benziger was not only a publishing house but a liturgical-supply factory. The American firm of Benziger Brothers is now independent of the Swiss house. The Holy See conferred on the firm the title \\"Printers to the Holy Apostolic See\\" in 1867. = 20th and 21st century =  United States  In 1968, Benziger's American business was acquired by Crowell-Collier Macmillan (later to become Macmillan, Inc.), and the following year, its headquarters were moved to California. In 1971, it was merged with three other companies: Bruce Publishing, founded in Milwaukee in the 1890s, P. J. Kenedy & Sons of New York (excluding the Official Catholic Directory) and Glencoe Press, which began in Beverly Hills in 1966. In July 2007, the Benziger name and product line were purchased from McGraw-Hill (which had acquired Macmillan's educational division) by CFM Publishing and merged with Texas-based Catholic publisher RCL (Resources for Christian Living), founded in 1964 by Richard C. Leach, to form RCL Benziger.Richard Leach The new company is now headquartered in Cincinnati as it was in the 19th century. In 2016, RCL Benziger was sold to Kendall Hunt Publishing.

Red hues designate hot areas, while regions with blue hues are cold. A hot, less-dense lower boundary layer sends plumes of hot material upwards, and likewise, cold material from the top moves downwards. This illustration is taken from a model of convection in the Earth's mantle. Convective heat transfer, often referred to simply as convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids. Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although often discussed as a distinct method of heat transfer, convective heat transfer involves the combined processes of unknown conduction (heat diffusion) and advection (heat transfer by bulk fluid flow). Overview Convection can be \\"forced\\" by movement of a fluid by means other than buoyancy forces (for example, a water pump in an automobile engine). Thermal expansion of fluids may also force convection. In other cases, natural buoyancy forces alone are entirely responsible for fluid motion when the fluid is heated, and this process is called \\"natural convection\\". An example is the draft in a chimney or around any fire. In natural convection, an increase in temperature produces a reduction in density, which in turn causes fluid motion due to pressures and forces when fluids of different densities are affected by gravity (or any g-force). For example, when water is heated on a stove, hot water from the bottom of the pan rises, displacing the colder denser liquid, which falls. After heating has stopped, mixing and conduction from this natural convection eventually result in a nearly homogeneous density, and even temperature. Without the presence of gravity (or conditions that cause a g-force of any type), natural convection does not occur, and only forced- convection modes operate. The convection heat transfer mode comprises one mechanism. In addition to energy transfer due to specific molecular motion (diffusion), energy is transferred by bulk, or macroscopic, motion of the fluid. This motion is associated with the fact that, at any instant, large numbers of molecules are moving collectively or as aggregates. Such motion, in the presence of a temperature gradient, contributes to heat transfer. Because the molecules in aggregate retain their random motion, the total heat transfer is then due to the superposition of energy transport by random motion of the molecules and by the bulk motion of the fluid. It is customary to use the term convection when referring to this cumulative transport and the term advection when referring to the transport due to bulk fluid motion.Incropera DeWitt VBergham Lavine 2007, Introduction to Heat Transfer, 5th ed., pg. 6 Types schlieren image reveals thermal convection from a human hand (in silhouette form) to the surrounding still exchange. Two types of convective heat transfer may be distinguished: * Free or natural convection: when fluid motion is caused by buoyancy forces that result from the density variations due to variations of thermal ¬±temperature in the fluid. In the absence of an internal source, when the fluid is in contact with a hot surface, its molecules separate and scatter, causing the fluid to be less dense. As a consequence, the fluid is displaced while the cooler fluid gets denser and the fluid sinks. Thus, the hotter volume transfers heat towards the cooler volume of that fluid.http://biocab.org/Heat_Transfer.html Biology Cabinet organization, April 2006, \\"Heat Transfer\\", Accessed 20/04/09 Familiar examples are the upward flow of air due to a fire or hot object and the circulation of water in a pot that is heated from below. * Forced convection: when a fluid is forced to flow over the surface by an internal source such as fans, by stirring, and pumps, creating an artificially induced convection current.http://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/convection.htm Engineers Edge, 2009, \\"Convection Heat Transfer\\",Accessed 20/04/09 In many real-life applications (e.g. heat losses at solar central receivers or cooling of photovoltaic panels), natural and forced convection occur at the same time (mixed convection). Internal and external flow can also classify convection. Internal flow occurs when a fluid is enclosed by a solid boundary such when flowing through a pipe. An external flow occurs when a fluid extends indefinitely without encountering a solid surface. Both of these types of convection, either natural or forced, can be internal or external because they are independent of each other. The bulk temperature, or the average fluid temperature, is a convenient reference point for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer, particularly in applications related to flow in pipes and ducts. Further classification can be made depending on the smoothness and undulations of the solid surfaces. Not all surfaces are smooth, though a bulk of the available information deals with smooth surfaces. Wavy irregular surfaces are commonly encountered in heat transfer devices which include solar collectors, regenerative heat exchangers and underground energy storage systems. They have a significant role to play in the heat transfer processes in these applications. Since they bring in an added complexity due to the undulations in the surfaces, they need to be tackled with mathematical finesse through elegant simplification techniques. Also they do affect the flow and heat transfer characteristics, thereby behaving differently from straight smooth surfaces.Aroon Shenoy, Mikhail Sheremet, Ioan Pop, 2016, Convective Flow and Heat Transfer from Wavy Surfaces: Viscous Fluids, Porous Media, and Nanofluids, CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Florida For a visual experience of natural convection, a glass filled with hot water and some red food dye may be placed inside a fish tank with cold, clear water. The convection currents of the red liquid may be seen to rise and fall in different regions, then eventually settle, illustrating the process as heat gradients are dissipated. Newton's law of cooling Convection-cooling is sometimes loosely assumed to be described by Newton's law of cooling.Based on a work by Newton published anonymously as \\"Scala graduum Caloris. Calorum Descriptiones & signa.\\" in Philosophical Transactions, 1701, 824-829; ed. Joannes Nichols, Isaaci Newtoni Opera quae exstant omnia, vol. 4 (1782), 403-407. Newton's law states that the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings while under the effects of a breeze. The constant of proportionality is the heat transfer coefficient. The law applies when the coefficient is independent, or relatively independent, of the temperature difference between object and environment. In classical natural convective heat transfer, the heat transfer coefficient is dependent on the temperature. However, Newton's law does approximate reality when the temperature changes are relatively small, and for forced air and pumped liquid cooling, where the fluid velocity does not rise with increasing temperature difference. Convective heat transfer The basic relationship for heat transfer by convection is: : \\\\dot{Q} = hA(T - T_f) ^b where \\\\dot{Q} is the heat transferred per unit time, A is the area of the object, h is the heat transfer coefficient, T is the object's surface temperature, Tf is the fluid temperature, and b is a scaling exponent. The convective heat transfer coefficient is dependent upon the physical properties of the fluid and the physical situation. Values of h have been measured and tabulated for commonly encountered fluids and flow situations.

His Securitate file however makes no assertion that he was Jewish. In a general atmosphere of hostility toward \\"rootless cosmopolites\\", the files of other Jews who had changed their names did mention their ethnic origin. His second wife, the former seamstress Eugenia SamoilƒÉ, was Jewish. See Levy, p. 340 for details. (January 31, 1908 - December 31, 1976) was a Romanian stateman and a high-ranking member of the Romanian Communist Party. Early life Born in Chitila, near Bucharest, he was the third of seven children of Constantin and Aneta Georgescu. Georgescu, whose formal education ended after the fourth grade, began his career as an assistant in his father's store. In 1923, he was sent to the main printing house in Bucharest, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, to apprentice as a typesetter. Three years later, his father now dead, he joined the Gutenberg printers' union and secretly began to read Communist leaflets. He soon joined the Communist party, then illegal. Underground activity Georgescu became a member of the party's Central Committee and its secretariat, participating in secret meetings, organising strikes, and spreading leaflets. Siguran»õa Statului, the Kingdom of Romania's secret services, began to keep an eye on him, and he was first arrested in 1933 for authoring leaflets that were spread in the typesetters' room at Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ. A young and capable lawyer, Iosif Schraer, ensured that Georgescu was released after only two months in prison and a few beatings. Further arrests followed; finally, after being detained in April 1941, the next month he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment at Caransebe»ô. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej named him leader of the prison's communist group before being transferred to T√¢rgu Jiu prison in 1943. Career peak (1944-52) Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Teohari Georgescu, and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej watching a May Day parade in Bucharest, 1946 He was released after the arrival of the Red Army in August 1944, and at Ana Pauker's suggestion he became undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Interior on November 4. He was well-qualified for the clandestine work the job required: in 1940, in Moscow, Georgescu had received training, coordinated by Georgi Dimitrov, from NKVD agents; he learned both the secret code for corresponding with the Comintern, and a special technique for writing its messages on glass. In Bucharest he communicated, either directly or through Gheorghe Pintilie, with General Dmitri Fedichkin, a Soviet adviser who gave him orders to infiltrate and Sovietize the security services: Siguran»õa Statului (the secret police), the Gendarmerie, and Serviciul Special de Informa»õii (lit. \\"Special Intelligence Service\\"). Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Ana Pauker, Vasile Luca, and Georgescu at the Great National Assembly in April 1951 As a reward for accomplishing this mission, Georgescu was promoted to Minister of Interior once Petru Groza's government took power on March 6, 1945. He also served on the Politburo, was the Secretary of the Party's Central Committee, and ran the United Workers' Front, which coordinated the actions of communists and social democrats. As Minister of Interior he contributed to the country's denazification and later to the reorganization of the law enforcement system along the Soviet model, supervising the establishment of several penal colonies and coordinating a dekulakization campaign. Along Gheorghiu-Dej, Pauker, and Vasile Luca, he was considered one of leaders directing the new regime's policy, as highlighted by the popular epigram \\"Ana, Luca, Teo, Dej / BagƒÉ spaima √Æn burgheji\\" (Ana, Luca, Teo[hari], Dej / Put the fear into the bourgeois\\"). Fall from grace 1952 In January 1952, General Secretary Gheorghiu-Dej travelled to Moscow to seek Joseph Stalin's approval for purging the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, accusing Pauker, Luca, and Georgescu of fomenting factional intrigue; Vyacheslav Molotov intervened on behalf of Pauker, whereas Lavrentiy Beria defended Georgescu.Hodos, p. 103 Together with Pauker and Luca, Georgescu was purged at the plenum of May 26‚Äì27, 1952, simultaneously accused of left-wing and right-wing deviationism. He was also accused of a conciliatory stance regarding Luca's deviation and, ironically, of insufficient militancy against the class enemy and revolutionary vigilance. He was thus dismissed from his ministerial post on May 28, losing all his other party and state posts as well: vice-premier, member of the secretariat, politburo and orgburo.TismƒÉneanu, p. 130 Unlike the other two, he had not spent World War II in Moscow, but the Comintern's suggestion in 1940 that Georgescu be made General Secretary kept Gheorghiu-Dej wary of his influence. Furthermore, as Luca and Pauker began to fall from grace in early 1952 (their fate having been decided in Moscow), he made the mistake of standing by them. Initially \\"assigned to work at a lower level\\", he was arrested on February 18, 1953, and investigated by his former subordinates at the Securitate for three years. At one point, his wife and two children (one of them an infant) were arrested in order to induce him to give evidence against Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu. He confessed guilt to all charges, but was nevertheless released in April 1956. Georgescu returned to his old workplace, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, now called \\"√éntreprinderea 13 Decembrie\\", first working as a proofreader and then being appointed manager before retiring in 1963. Rehabilition under Ceau»ôescu (1968‚Äì1974) After Nicolae Ceau»ôescu came to power in 1965, he was rehabilitated at the April 1968 plenary. He was appointed candidate member of the Central Committee at the party's 1972 national conference, holding the post until 1974. He died in obscurity; after cremation, his ashes were placed in the Monument of the Heroes for the Freedom of the People and of the Motherland, for Socialism in Bucharest's Carol Park, being removed after the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

He has since pursued a career in public affairs and government relations, overseeing the Government and Public Affairs Division of Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and as Chief of Staff to the Energy and Resources Minister, Chris Hartcher from 2011 to 2014. He is currently the CEO of Barton Deakin, a national, Coalition-aligned lobbying firm founded by his former parliamentary colleague, Peter Collins. Early life Humpherson was born in the United Kingdom in 1960. His family moved to Australia in 1970 and he was educated at Davidson High School where he became a member of the Student Representative Council and the Warringah Youth Council. He attended the University of New South Wales where he graduated with honours in the degree of Bachelor of Engineering (Chemical). Between 1986 and 1992 he was employed as an engineer and also a Territory Manager for Shell Australia. Humpherson entered politics on 14 March 1987 as an independent Councillor on Warringah Shire Council and was Deputy Shire President from 1991‚Äì1992 until he resigned on 30 May 1992, following his election to state parliament. Political career Humpherson was elected into the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the seat of Davidson, at a May 1992 by-election brought on by the resignation of former Education Minister and Liberal-turned- independent member Terry Metherell, who resigned to take up a public service appointment offered by the Greiner government. The Independent Commission Against Corruption undertook an investigation into the appointment amid allegations that this amounted to a corrupt attempt to have Davidson return to the Liberal Party, which had lost its parliamentary majority at the 1991 election. The independents who held the balance of power subsequently forced Greiner's resignation as Premier, but ICAC was found to have exceeded its jurisdiction by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. However Davidson returned to the Liberals, with Humpherson easily winning the by-election ahead of 14 other candidates, despite a 16.1 per cent swing against the Liberal Party. As a backbencher, Humpherson served in various Parliamentary committees, until in 2000 when he was appointed as a Shadow Minister under Opposition Leader Kerry Chikarovski. He held various shadow portfolios including Housing and Corrective Services (2000‚Äì2002), Planning and Environment (2002‚Äì2003), Justice (2003‚Äì2006), Community Services (2005‚Äì2006) and Emergency Services (2003‚Äì2007). Humpherson was narrowly defeated in a preselection battle before the 2007 election in favour of insurance executive, Jonathan O'Dea. Humpherson had cross-factional backing among many delegates, but attracted controversy in local branches after reportedly suggesting party members to quit branches under O'Dea's control, thereby reducing their voting power, a practice known as 'branch stripping'. Despite having support of the Party Leader, Peter Debnam, Humpherson lost the vote 52 votes to 54 and he retired from parliament. Later career In March 2007, Humpherson was appointed to the newly created position of general manager of Government and Public Affairs at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and was a member of the management committee. Humpherson left ANSTO in late 2010 to establish his own government relations consultancy, Waratah Advisory, in anticipation of an expected Liberal win at the March 2011 NSW election and accepted a position as Chief of Staff to the newly appointed Resources and Energy Minister, Chris Hartcher.Humpherson then took up a consulting role with the NSW Minerals Council. Since 2015 he has been a Director of Barton Deakin, a Liberal-aligned lobbying firm founded by his former parliamentary colleague, Peter Collins. He became CEO of Barton Deakin in 2019, and currently leads the organisation across it Australian jurisdictions with his deep understanding of politics, extensive senior networks across politics at State and Federal levels and expertise in the resources, energy and development sectors.

It was conceived by 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. Yunus communicated his ideas to the people of the nation and asked for feedbacks by writing a total of three letters addressed to the citizens in the prominent national daily The Daily Star. Yunus discontinued his venture in 2007 citing lack of interested eligible candidates. Political situation of Bangladesh Bangladeshi politics was marred by instability, especially during the turmoil of 2006‚Äì08. Most top politicians, including former Prime Ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina were imprisoned on corruption charges, and a state of emergency existed. Hence, to counter the rampant corruption in politics, Yunus proposed a political party run by clean honest people. History In early 2006 Yunus, along with other members of the civil society including Professor Rehman Sobhan, former chief justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman, jurist Kamal Hossain, Prothom Alo editor Matiur Rahman, The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam and economist Debapriya Bhattacharya, participated in a campaign for honest and clean candidates in national elections. He considered entering politics in the later part of that year. First letter On 11 February 2007, Yunus wrote an open letter, published in the Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star, where he asked citizens for views on his plan to float a political party to establish political goodwill, proper leadership and good governance. In the letter, he called on everyone to briefly outline how he should go about the task and how they can contribute to it. Unveiling Yunus finally announced the foundation of a new party tentatively called Citizens' Power (Nagorik Shakti) on 18 February 2007. There was speculation that the army supported a move by Yunus into politics. Second letter The second letter written by Yunus addressed to the citizens expressed his interests to join politics, outlining the foundations and principles of the party, a detailed organizational structure for the grassroots of the party, and featured addresses to women, the young, and the expatriates. =Motto and principles= Bangladesh egiye cholo or \\"March Ahead, Bangladesh\\" was to be the theme title of the movement, as declared in the second letter to the people. Among its aims is the reinstatement of a secular constitution as well as gains in female empowerment and the fight against poverty and corruption. It will attempt to appoint capable leaders with a commitment to honest governance and accountability. Dr. Yunus intended to make Bangladesh an economical check-point in South Asia by opening up its ports and establishing global ties. =Organization= Yunus outlined the organizational structure of the party through his second letter to the people. The organisation of Nagorik Shakti was to be mostly based on the rural areas of Bangladesh: the villages. It was assumed that there will be 20 working people, and hoped that the parties will avoid going down the path of the more unruly elements in Bangladeshi politics by avoiding formal showdown such as public meetings, preferring instead to convince the electorate by proclaiming facts. Each unit should have 50% female worker- supporter and must have at least 33%. Ideally, females and young people should be among the party's key players. Each team or group must be able to nominate others to higher positions and this practice should be carried on right up to constituency level. Party expenses will be covered by its members. Yunus intended his party to run for all 300 constituencies during the 2008 parliamentary elections. Conflict of interest with Grameen Bank Yunus wants to avoid accusations of conflict of interest between his role in Shakti and with the Grameen Bank‚Äîthe pioneering microcredit lender he founded in 1976. He has stated that he will reduce his involvement with the Bank, and that no Grameen Bank executives will be involved with the party. Reactions in the political arena Right from its inception, the party has caused quite a stir in political circles. Though many political leaders initially remained tight-lipped, some expressed their bitterness regarding the party. Then Former Premier Sheikh Hasina expressed her displeasure over Yunus joining politics, saying, \\"Newcomers in politics are dangerous elements and are to be viewed with suspicion, they often do more harm to the nation than good.\\" Mufti Aminee, one of the former four-party alliance leaders was even less charitable in his views on the Professor, saying \\"Dr. Yunus is an enemy of the country, nation and Islam.\\" Third letter On 3 May, however, Yunus declared that he had decided to abandon his political plans following a meeting with the head of the interim government, Fakhruddin Ahmed.

These laws regulate the manufacture, trade, possession, transfer, record keeping, transport, and destruction of firearms, ammunition, and firearms accessories. They are enforced by state agencies and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). In addition to federal gun laws, all state governments and some local governments have their own laws that regulate firearms. The right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. Major federal gun laws Most federal gun laws are found in the following acts: *National Firearms Act (\\"NFA\\") (1934): Taxes the manufacture and transfer of, and mandates the registration of Title II weapons such as machine guns, short- barreled rifles and shotguns, heavy weapons, explosive ordnance, suppressors, and disguised or improvised firearms. *Federal Firearms Act of 1938 (\\"FFA\\"): Requires that gun manufacturers, importers, and those in the business of selling firearms have a Federal Firearms License (FFL). Prohibits the transfer of firearms to certain classes of people, such as convicted felons. *Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (1968): Prohibited interstate trade in handguns, increased the minimum age to 21 for buying handguns. *Gun Control Act of 1968 (\\"GCA\\"): Focuses primarily on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers, dealers and importers. *Firearm Owners Protection Act (\\"FOPA\\") (1986): Revised and partially repealed the Gun Control Act of 1968. Prohibited the sale to civilians of automatic firearms manufactured after the date of the law's passage. Required ATF approval of transfers of automatic firearms. *Undetectable Firearms Act (1988): Effectively criminalizes, with a few exceptions, the manufacture, importation, sale, shipment, delivery, possession, transfer, or receipt of firearms with less than 3.7 oz of metal content. *Gun-Free School Zones Act (1990): Prohibits unauthorized individuals from knowingly possessing a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone. *Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993): Requires background checks on most firearm purchasers, depending on seller and venue. *Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994‚Äì2004): Banned semiautomatics that looked like assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. The law expired in 2004. *Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (2004): Granted law enforcement officers and former law enforcement officers the right to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of state or local laws, with certain exceptions. *Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (2005): Prevents firearms manufacturers and licensed dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products. =Overview of current regulations= Fugitives, those convicted of a felony with a sentence exceeding 1 year, past or present, and those who were involuntarily admitted to a mental facility are prohibited from purchasing a firearm; unless rights restored. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago (2010) that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.Liptak, Adam (June 28, 2010). \\"Justices Extend Firearm Rights in 5-to-4 Ruling\\", New York Times. Retrieved February 21, 2015. History Important events regarding gun legislation occurred in the following years. In 1791, the United States Bill of Rights were ratified which included the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution which stated that \\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\" In 1934, with the abundance of gang related crime, such as the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, the National Firearms Act (\\"NFA\\") was signed into law under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Administration. The NFA is considered to be the first federal legislation to enforce gun control in the United States, imposing a $200 tax, equivalent to nearly $4,000 in 2019, on the manufacture and transfer of Title II weapons. It also mandated the registration of machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, heavy weapons, explosive ordnance, suppressors, and disguised or improvised firearms. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal Firearms Act of 1938 (\\"FFA\\") into law, requiring that all gun related businesses must have a Federal Firearms License (FFL). In 1939, through the court case United States v. Miller, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Congress could regulate interstate selling sawed-off shotguns through the National Firearms Act of 1934, deeming that such a weapon has no reasonable relationship with the efficiency of a well regulated militia. In 1968, following the spree of political assassinations including: the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, President Lyndon B. Johnson, pushed Congress for the Gun Control Act of 1968 (\\"GCA\\"). It repealed and replaced the FFA, regulated ‚Äúdestructive devices‚Äù (such as bombs, mines, grenades, and other explosives), expanded the definition of machine gun, required the serialization of manufactured or imported guns, banned importing military style weapons, and imposed a 21 age minimum on the purchasing of handguns from FFLs. The GCA also prohibited selling of firearms to felons and the mentally ill. In 1986, contrary to prior gun legislation, the Firearm Owners Protection Act (\\"FOPA\\") (1986), passed under the Ronald Reagan administration, enacted protections for gun owners. It prohibited a national registry of dealer records, limited ATF inspections to conduct annual inspections (unless multiple infractions have been observed), allowed licensed dealers to sell firearms at \\"gun shows\\" in their state, and loosened regulations on the sale and transfer of ammunition. However the FOPA also prohibited civilian ownership or transfer of machine guns made after May 19, 1986, and redefined \\"silencer\\" to include silencer parts. In 1993, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, named after a White House press secretary who was disabled during the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, was signed into law under the presidency of Bill Clinton. This act required that background checks must be conducted on gun purchases and established a criminal background check system maintained by the FBI. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was signed into law under the presidency of Bill Clinton, which included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, effectively banned the manufacturing, selling, and possession of specific military-style assault weapons such as AR-15 style rifles and banned high-capacity ammunition magazines that held over 10 rounds. Banned arms that were previously legally possessed were grandfathered. The ban expired in September 2004. In 2003, the Tiahrt Amendment proposed by Kansas Representative, Todd Tiahrt, limited the ATF to only release information from its firearms trace database to only law enforcement agencies or a prosecutors in connection with a criminal investigation. In 2005, The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was signed into law under the presidency of George W. Bush. This act protected gun manufacturers from being named in federal or state civil suits by those who were victims of crimes involving guns made by that company. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in the case District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment is an \\"individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia\\" and struck down Washington D.C.'s handgun ban. But the Supreme Court also stated \\"that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and that guns and gun ownership would continue to be regulated.\\" In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in the case McDonald v. Chicago that the Second Amendment is incorporated and thus applies against the states. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled in the case Caetano v. Massachusetts that \\"the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding\\". Second Amendment The right to keep and bear arms in the United States is protected by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While there have been contentious debates on the nature of this right, there was a lack of clear federal court rulings defining the right until the two U.S. Supreme Court cases of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010). An individual right to own a gun for personal use was affirmed in the landmark District of Columbia v. Heller decision in 2008, which overturned a handgun ban in the federal District of Columbia.Greenhouse, Linda (June 27, 2008). \\"Justices Rule for Individual Gun Rights\\", The New York Times. Retrieved February 15, 2015. In the Heller decision, the court's majority opinion said that the Second Amendment protects \\"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\\" However, in delivering the majority opinion, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote on the Second Amendment not being an unlimited right: The four dissenting justices argued that the majority had broken prior precedent on the Second Amendment, and took the position that the amendment refers to an individual right, but in the context of militia service.See \\"District of Columbia v. Heller: The Individual Right to Bear Arms\\" (PDF) (comment), Harvard Law Review, Vol. 122, pp. 141‚Äì142 (2008): \\"Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, agreeing with the majority that the Second Amendment confers an individual right, but disagreeing as to the scope of that right. ... Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer joined Justice Stevens's opinion.\\" In the McDonald v. City of Chicago decision in 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that, because of the incorporation of the Bill of Rights, the guarantee of an individual right to bear arms applies to state and local gun control laws and not just federal laws.Liptak, Adam (June 28, 2010). \\"Justices Extend Firearm Rights in 5-to-4 Ruling\\", The New York Times.

Shashmaqam means the six Maqams (modes) in the Persian language, dastgah being the name for Persian modes, and maqams being the name for modes more generally. It is a refined sort of music, with lyrics derived from Sufi poems about divine love. The instruments of shashmaqam provide an austere accompaniment to the voices. They consist, at most concerts, of a pair of long-necked lutes, the dayra, or frame drum, which, with its jingles, is very much like a tambourine, and the sato, or bowed tanbour, which vaguely resembles a bass fiddle. History Shashmaqam in Tajikistan In the first half of the 20th century in Uzbekistan, Abdul Rauf Fitrad, member of the Jadid, was particularly interested in shashmaqam, the traditional music of the Court. In 1927, he wrote a book called Ozbek klasik Muzikasi va uning Tarikhi (Uzbek classical music and its history), in which he presented shashmaqam as a grand musical tradition of the Uzbek people. In the 1930s, during the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin, Uzbek shashmaqam was seen as an echo of the feudal ruling class and as a kind of music that promoted cultural progress toward adoption of European-style harmony. Finally, in 1951, a decree from the president of the Uzbekistan Union of Composers, reaffirmed by the committee of Uzbekistan, suppressed the maqam and the development of the musical practice. During the mid-50s, the maqam began an ideological rehabilitation. Tajikistan, which had been an autonomous region of Uzbekistan in the 1920s, finally became a republic. The Tajik leaders decided that shashmaqam should form a part of their great cultural tradition. Thus, shashmaqam was divided in two: the Tajik shashmaqam published in Dushanbe, and the Uzbek shashmaqam published in Tashkent. The Tajik books made no mention of Uzbek shashmaqam and vice versa. During the 1980s, this artificial division began to change. Uzbekistan began to learn of the Uzbek-Tajik shashmaqam, and Tajikistan learnt of the Tajik- Uzbek shashmaqam. This has survived to the present, but a surge of nationalism in Uzbekistan may change that: singers on the radio in Bukhara, a city perfectly bilingual in Uzbek and Tajik, are using only the Uzbek texts in their shashmaqam music broadcasts.Theodore Levin, The Reterritorialization of Culture in the New Central Asian States: A Report from Uzbekistan. Year of traditional Music, Vol. 25, Musical Processes in Asia and Oceania. (1993) pp. 51-59 This style of music was brought to the Western world, particularly to the United States, by the Bukharian Jews of Central Asia. Many of them were successful performers of Shasmaqam and brought their talent to the West.

The Cordis global headquarters and a Europe, Middle East and Africa hub are located in Baar, Switzerland. The North American operations are based out of the San Francisco Bay area. The Asia-Pacific hub is located in Singapore, and the Latin American hub in Puerto Rico.[1]  History  The Medical Development Corporation was founded in 1957 in Miami, Florida, by Dr. William P. Murphy Jr. and focused on interventional vascular medicine and neuroscience. In 1959 the company‚Äôs name changed to Cordis. 1962 The first synchronous cardiac pacemaker co-developed by Cordis is implanted in a patient. 1970s Cordis introduces the first sheath introducers with hemostasis valves, designed to minimize blood loss during an angioplasty procedure. 1980s Cordis launches a full line of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) guiding catheters. 1990s Cordis introduces the first PTCA balloon utilizing nylon balloon material. 1994 Cordis receives FDA- approval for the first bare-metal stent in the US, the PALMAZ-SCHATZ Balloon- Expandable Stent for coronary artery applications. 1996 Cordis joins the Johnson & Johnson interventional business called ‚ÄúJohnson & Johnson Intervention Systems (JJIS)‚Äù and forms Cordis Corporation. In 1997 Cordis Corporation expanded into the rapidly growing field of electrophysiology through the acquisition of Biosense Inc. One year later, in 1998, Biosense Inc. merged with Webster Laboratories to form Biosense Webster, Inc. 2002 The CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent, the first drug-eluting stent for patients with coronary heart disease is approved for use in the EU. 2008 Three million patients worldwide had received the CYPHER Stent, a milestone unreached by any other drug-eluting stent at that time. 2010 EXOSEAL an innovative vascular closure device with extravascular bio absorbable plug placement and excellent clinical results receives CE-mark in Europe. 2013 Launch of 'Smart Flex Self-Expanding Stent System. The device belongs to a new generation of self-expandable stents for peripheral indications and is ‚Äúfully connected and yet flexible.' 2014 Cordis Corporation announced the launch of its INCRAFT AAA Stent Graft System (INCRAFT System), an ultra-low profile device for use during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for patients suffering from infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). This device is an advancement in the EVAR field and provides a new option for patients and physicians seeking a less invasive treatment approach for AAA. As of 2015, Cordis is a part of Cardinal Health. On October 4, 2015, Cardinal Health announced that it has completed the acquisition of Johnson & Johnson's Cordis business for $1.944 billion.[2] In its press release of October 4, 2015 company claims that ‚ÄúThe acquisition of Cordis will strengthen Cardinal Health's portfolio of physician preference items, which include offerings in the cardiovascular, wound management, and orthopedics areas.‚Äù Senior Vice President of equity research with FBR Capital Markets & Co in New York, Steven Halper, expressed his opinion on the acquisition, calling it a ‚Äúdirect outgrowth of the need to reinvest and grow the business\\". Furthermore, he believes that Cardinal Health inherits not only Cordis‚Äô large portfolio of interventional cardiology products, but also a wide global footprint and a name in the marketplace. In 2014, Cordis had sales of $780 million with 70% of revenue coming from overseas all of which was attractive to Cardinal Health. 2017 Cordis received the CE Mark for its new RAILWAY‚Ñ¢ Sheathless Access System, which enables direct access to the radial artery with a guiding catheter and eliminates the need for an introducer sheath, reducing the size of the arterial puncture site up to 2F compared to a conventional sheath system. On April 18, 2017, Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) announces that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medtronic's Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses for $6.1 billion in cash.  Strategic agreements  On October 31, 2016 Cardinal Health announces several new strategic distribution agreements enabling Cordis, Cardinal Health‚Äôs interventional vascular business, to expand its product portfolio in select countries globally. These distribution agreements are related to coronary stents and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) balloon catheters in Cordis‚Äô portfolio of products that support the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. On March 31, 2017 Cardinal Health announced two new strategic agreements that will enable Cordis, Cardinal Health‚Äôs interventional vascular business, to rapidly expand its cardiology product offering in China. These strategic agreements will add new percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) balloon catheters, manufactured both in China and internationally, to the Cordis‚Äô portfolio.

The most geographically isolated member of the genus, it is considered a critically endangered species and has been called one of the rarest palms in the Americas. Description Attalea crassispatha has a single stem which grows up to tall. The stem is grey, up to in diameter, and can be columnar, or slightly swollen at the base of the middle of the stem. Individuals bear 15 to 19 pinnately compound leaves‚Äîleaves in which rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern‚Äîwith 127 to 165 pairs of leaflets. Leaves consist of a leaf sheath which wraps around the trunk, a rachis, from which the leaflets emerge, and a petiole, which connects the leaf sheath with the rachis. The leaf sheath is open (it does not wrap completely around the stem); when the leaf is shed, the leaf sheath detached cleanly from the stem. The sheath and petiole combined are long, while the rachis is long. The inflorescences are born among the leaves. They are either predominantly male, or have a mixture of male and female flowers. The inflorescence consists of a main axis‚Äîthe peduncle and the rachis‚Äîand a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, emerge from the rachis. The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem. The peduncle, the main stalk of the inflorescence, is no more than long and up to in diameter. The rachis is up to while the rachillae, which can number in the hundreds, reach a length of about . The fruit is reddish when ripe. The seeds, which are about long and in diameter are covered by a mesocarp and a endocarp. Distribution Very little natural vegetation survives in Haiti. Attalea crassispatha is found in three anthropogenic habitats‚Äîfield gardens, courtyard gardens, and shrub forest. Field gardens are typically a mixture of annual crops which are farmed for a few years and then converted to pasture. Courtyard gardens are cultivated with perennial crops, usually on more fertile soils. Shrub forests are small patches of secondary forest, often on dry stony areas which are least suitable for agriculture. Joel Timyan and Sameul Reep considered courtyard gardens to have the highest potential for survival and regeneration. At the other extreme, they found only one case of natural regeneration in a field garden. Taxonomy Attalea crassispatha is the most isolated disjunct in the genus Attalea. All the other species in the genus are Central or South American species; the only other species found in the insular Caribbean, A. maripa and A. osmantha, are found in Trinidad and Tobago, at the extreme southern end of the Caribbean. Its small population size and extreme isolation from other members of the genus make A. crassispatha scientifically interesting. This isolation was supported by a molecular phylogeny of the group published in 2009. Alan Meerow and colleagues found A. crassispatha to belong to a clade that included the \\"Scheelea clade\\" and the two \\"Orbignya clades\\", but that it was a sister to both groups. =History= Charles Plumier visited the island of Hispaniola in 1689 and published a description of the species in 1703. Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius used Plumier's notes and drawings to give the species a formal Linnaean description in 1884 placing it in the genus Maximiliana. In 1929 Max Burret transferred the species to Attalea. In 1939 O. F. Cook placed the species in a new genus, Bornoa, named for Louis Borno, former President of Haiti. However, Cook did not validly publish it, making the name invalid. Liberty Hyde Bailey kept the species in the genus Attalea. S. F. Glassman considered it close to the genus Orbignya, but suggested that it may represent a new genus. Recent work has favoured maintaining these taxa in a single genus, Attalea. =Common names= Common names for the species include carossier, carroussier, c√¥rossi√©, petit coco, kawosie, ti koko, kowos, kokowos, kolowosh and kowos etranj√®. Uses The seeds of Attalea crassispatha are edible; the flavour is reported to be similar to that of coconut, but it is richer in fats and denser. The nuts are also a good source of cooking oil. The bract is used as a bowl for feeding pigs. The leaves are used for thatch and weaving, but only when the more common fan palms Sabal causiarum and Coccothrinax argentea are unavailable. It is also used as a source of lumber and as a boundary marker between farmers' fields due to its longevity and ability to survive hurricanes. Conservation , Attalea crassispatha was considered a critically endangered species with an estimated population of fewer than 50 mature individuals. As a result of its small population size, A. crassispatha has been described as being one of the rarest palms in the Americas. Efforts are underway to conserve the species by planting seedlings both in Haiti and elsewhere; in 1991 seeds were distributed to botanic gardens in 12 countries.

Its studios are located on South Eleventh Street in Beaumont and its transmitter is located in Vidor, Texas. Ratings and Popularity The Beaumont/Port Arthur Radio market is the #133 radio market in size according to the Arbitron rating service. As of Fall 2006, KQXY-FM was the 2nd highest rated station with a 9.3% share of the 15+ market, behind sister Urban station KTCX's 17.0% market share in the Beaumont/Port Arthur DMA. History KQXY signed on the air as a licensed Class C FM broadcast facility, with the call sign KLVI-FM on January 3, 1967, with an ERP of 59 kilowatts, from a HAAT of 230 meters, and as the FM sister to KLVI. The facility was originally proposed by and licensed to John H. Hicks, Jr. & Madelyn O. Hicks. The callsign of KLVI-FM would quickly be changed in September 1967 to KBPO to reflect the three major communities served of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange. On September 15, 1976, the station would become the current KQXY as \\"The Beautiful Q\\", the Golden Triangle's easy listening radio station.

This Hindu migration was different from those in East African countries such as Kenya and Uganda where Hindus arrived voluntarily for jobs but without restrictive contracts; it was quite similar to the arrival of Indian workers in South Africa, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago with slave-like contract restrictions for plantation work owned by Europeans, particularly the British. Most Hindus who arrived for these indentured plantation work were originally from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, people escaping from major repetitive famines in colonial British India from 1860s to 1910s. These laborers came for a fixed period irrevocable contract of exclusive servitude, with an option to either go back to India with plantation paid return fare, or stay in a local settlement after the contract ended. Most chose to stay and continue working for a salary. Zimbabwe. ;Ancient and medieval history Archaeological studies in Zimbabwe and the Swahili coast have revealed evidence that suggests that Indian traders had a small presence and sporadic interaction with the African people during the Roman Empire period (early 1st millennium CE) and thereafter, long pre-dating the European colonial era.Lionel Casson (1974), Rome's Trade with the East: The Sea Voyage to Africa and India, Transactions of the American Philological Association, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Vol. 110 (1980), pp. 21-36 Similarly, genetic studies suggest a direct ancient African-Indian trade and cooperation because by the 1st millennium BCE African crops were adopted in India, and Indian crops as well as the domesticated zebu cow (Bos indicus) were adopted in Africa, but these were missing from north Africa, the northeastern horn of Africa and Arabia during that age. The development of gold mining and processing methods among the Shona people in Zimbabwe highlands increased its trading activity with India before the 12th century, particularly through the city of Sofala. However, these traders did not engage in religious missionary activity and Hinduism was limited to the traders. ;Colonial era migration Hinduism came with indentured laborers brought to Zimbabwe, and they were a part of a global movement of workers during the colonial era, to help with plantation and mining related projects when local skilled labor was unavailable, to build infrastructure projects, establish services, retail markets and for administrative support. The immigrants, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling in famine prone areas of India, came to escape starvation and work in plantations owned by the Europeans. According to Ezra Chitando, the 19th- and early 20th-century encounters between European Christians with both Hinduism and African Traditional Religions in Zimbabwe were complex, generally demonizing and dehumanizing both Hinduism and African religions, but the Christian missionaries never totally condemn Hinduism or African religions. The Christian officials identified some positive elements in both, but states Chitando, then called upon the Hindu Indian workers and local Africans to \\"abandon their traditions and embrace their [Christian] version of reality\\". In contrast to Christian missionary approach, neither Hinduism nor African Traditional Religions were missionary in their approach or goals. Demographics As of 1995 there were about 16,200 Hindus in Zimbabwe. It reduced to 3,000 or 500 families. They are mostly in the capital city of Harare. http://hindoosocietyharare.co.zw/index.php/about-us/future-of- the-society Hindu temple and organisation The Hindus in Zimbabwe is represented by the Hindoo Society Harare (HSH).It is a Hindu welfare organization registered in 1916.Hindu Religious and Cultural Institute (HRCI) was founded 60 years ago.

This RNA transcript forms a class of protein-RNA complexes called H/ACA box snoRNPs. Shq1p is believed to interact with these snoRNP complexes. Shq1p is a protein involved in the rRNA processing pathway. It was discovered by Pok Yang in the Chanfreau laboratory at UCLA. Depletion of Shq1p has led to decreased level of various H/ACA box snoRNAs (H/ACA box snoRNAs are responsible for pseuduridylation of pre-rRNA) and certain pre-rRNA intermediates.Yang PK, Rotondo G, Porras T, Legrain P, Chanfreau G. The Shq1p.Naf1p complex is required for box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle biogenesis. J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 22;277(47):45235-42.  Background  During the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes, four mature ribosomal RNAs (the 5S, 5.8S, 18S, and 25S) must be synthesized. Three of these rRNAs (5.8S, 18S, and 25S) come from a single pre-rRNA known as the 35S. Although many of the intermediates in this rRNA processing pathway have been identified in the last thirty years, there are still a number of proteins involved in this process whose specific function is unknown.  Function  Shq1, a protein thought to play a role in the stabilization and/or production of box H/ACA snoRNA, is still uncharacterized. It has been proposed that Shq1, along with Naf1p, is involved in the initial steps of the biogenesis of H/ACA box snoRNPs (box H/ACA snoRNAs form complexes with proteins, thereby forming snoRNPs) because of its association with certain snoRNP proteins during the snoRNP‚Äôs maturation, while showing very little association with the mature snoRNP complex. Despite the known involvement of Shq1 in H/ACA box snoRNP's production, the exact function of this protein in the overall rRNA processing pathway is still unknown.

They died on April 11, 2020. Work Baggs created a website titled ‚ÄúGetting the Truth Out,‚Äù a response to a campaign by the Autism Society of America. They claimed that the ASA's campaign made autistic people objects of pity. They also spoke at conferences about disabilities, and worked with Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists that were researching autism. In January 2007, Baggs posted a video on YouTube entitled In My Language describing the experience of living as a person with autism, which became the subject of several articles on CNN. Baggs also guest-blogged about the video on Anderson Cooper's blog and answered questions from the audience via email. About Baggs, Sanjay Gupta said: Video artist Mark Leckey admitted that he is, in a sense, envious of Baggs' empathic relationship to inanimate objects. The singing at the beginning of Leckey's video Prop4aShw is from Baggs' In My Language. Baggs described themself as genderless and nonbinary in their writings. They also advocated for a consistent definition of autism awareness, claiming that awareness was misrepresented by both parents and some advocates. They wrote articles in two online blogs: ballastexistenz and Cussin‚Äô and Discussin‚Äô. Baggs said they named their first blog ballastexistenz to show that people like them were capable of living a worthy life, since it was a historical term used to describe disabled people as incapable.

Baggs moved from California to Vermont in order to be closer to a friend in 2005. Several classmates of Baggs have found the presence of their alleged impairments to be unusual, subsequently claiming that Baggs \\"spoke, attended classes, dated, and otherwise acted in a completely typical fashion.\\" Baggs did not dispute those details online, but claimed a loss of all functional speech in their 20s. Additionally, other autism advocates have also questioned the validity of their diagnosis. Baggs claimed that augmentative communication is somewhat common among autistic individuals, though they also supported the use of facilitated communication and other scientifically discredited alternative therapies. Baggs claimed to use FC, and that Fey, their cat, was their best facilitator as Fey moved their limbs around. In addition to autism, Baggs had also claimed to have been diagnosed with and wrote about numerous other syndromes and disabilities, including bipolar disorder, dissociative disorder, psychotic disorder, and gastroparesis.

CORDIS content dates back to the origin of the service in 1990 and the website has been online since 1994, as the first website of the European institutions. Organisation and legal basis CORDIS is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union, on behalf of the European Commission's research Directorates-General and Agencies. CORDIS was created in 1990 following a Communication of the Commission for the implementation of an RTD information service (SEC(1988)1831). The legal basis and financing of CORDIS derive from the work programmes of Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. Creation The creation of CORDIS was a DG XIII initiative - the Commission decision SEC(88)1831 allowed the service to be first established in 1988. In 1989 the launch of the VALUE Programme provided a convenient vehicle to carry the development of the budding CORDIS service. The first three databases were established and first published on the ESPRIT Day in November 1990. Users could review R&D; Programmes, R&D; Projects and R&D; Publications using the Common Command Language (CCL) on the ECHO (European Commission Host Organisation) server. This meant that only trained experts could use the service, but nevertheless some 500 user sessions were registered during the first month. History =Early 90s= By the end of the first year in late 1991 three new databases had been added (R&D; Acronyms, R&D; Results and R&D-related; COMdocuments). These six databases could be accessed via a \\"videotex\\"-style menu. The total number of database records had swelled to around 70 000. Some 800 people had registered as CORDIS users and up to 1,000 user sessions were taking place each month. However, CORDIS was still a specialist tool used mainly by librarians and a few other experts who could use the service. In April 1992, the Council decision for more centralised action under the VALUE2 Programme confirmed the need for CORDIS and gave a boost to its development. The development of a Common Production System (CPS) was initiated to facilitate quality management of all information. In 1993, three more databases were added (R&D; Contacts, R&D; Partners and R&D; News). The first full release of the CPS was completed, and a CD-ROM of all nine databases was made available. By this time the combined databases contained some 90,000 records, The number of registered users had more than doubled at 2,000 and some 6,000 user sessions per month were being experienced. =1994-1996= 1994 was an important year for CORDIS. The launch of the 4th R&D; Framework Programme (1994-1998), and within it the Innovation Programme, gave a further explicit mandate to CORDIS. Strong interest prompted the addition of German and French to the R&D; News database, marking the first language addition to an English language environment. Migration onto a new open systems architecture (UNIX- like system, FULCRUM databases, Web and FTP servers) facilitated the introduction of a number of new features - a WWW service, and a user-friendly Windows interface, WatchCORDIS. These measures boosted the system's attractiveness to users. By the end of the year, CORDIS offered some 130 000 database records which encouraged 11 000 registered users to perform nearly 15 000 user sessions per month. 1995-96 was a period of further consolidation and development. The CORDIS databases and web services were fully integrated as the migration into the new Information Dissemination environment (IDS) was completed. On-line host access was integrated into Watch-CORDIS and added to the CD-ROM service, allowing users to work both on-line and off-line coherently. The R&D; News service was enriched by adding Italian and Spanish, bringing the offer to five languages. The CORDIS-Focus publication was launched, providing readers with a paper edition of key R&D; News articles in three languages - EN, FR & DE. The first move to cover national R&D; information was initiated by Ireland with the start of the EU presidency service. By the end of 1996, CORDIS had 24,000 registered users eager to browse through 152 000 database records and accessing the web pages some 300,000 times per month. A period of rapid growth in numbers of users had been initiated by the move onto the WWW. =Late 90s= In 1997, Italian and Spanish editions brought the CORDIS focus offer up to five languages. Ireland was succeeded by The Netherlands and Luxembourg as Presidency countries and both published their presidency services on CORDIS. A new information monitoring service was launched - 'RAPIDUS - RAPId Delivery of Updates on Search-profiles'. A pilot project was launched to offer CORDIS as a host for national and regional web services. By the end of the year, user registration no longer seemed so relevant as some 53,000 identified users accessed over 800,000 Web pages per month and downloaded nearly 40,000 documents. It had become clear that CORDIS was no longer a tool reserved for specialists, the spectacular growth in use initiated in 1996 had continued. In 1998‚Äì99, the development of CORDIS continued at a brisk pace. A tenth database was added - the R&D; Document Library. The four successive EU presidency countries - UK, Austria, Germany and Finland - published their EU presidency services on CORDIS. The new fifth R&D; Framework Programme was officially launched in February 1999 and confirmed the role of CORDIS as the principal and official common information service for all EU R&D; activities. The Innovation/SMEs programme confirmed the financing of the CORDIS service and also enlarged its scope to cover innovation activities in general and innovation support services in particular. During 1999 there were 130 000 identified users, 300,000 document downloads and some 2.5 million user visits. =Early 2000s= *2000: Portuguese and French Presidencies, PAXIS service, redesigned FP5 service, RTD beyond 2002 service *2001: Swedish and Belgium Presidencies, Business incubators service, first Innobarometer report and innovation scoreboard, SME Techweb and SME/innovation studies, candidate countries service, FP6 launch *2002: Spanish and Danish Presidencies, My CORDIS, CORDIS Express, FP6 & EoI service, official FP6 service and FP6 calls, redesigned CORDIS technology marketplace, CORDIS Wire, Stats: 5 million pages accesses per month, 56 million ‚Äòhits‚Äô, 40,000 web pages, 230,000 users per month, 260,000 DB records *2003: Greek and Italian Presidencies, redesigned ERA service, FP6 glossary, new ICA search prototype, Science and Society service, IST Results integration, start of introduction of Integrated CORDIS Architecture *2004: Irish and Dutch Presidencies, new incubators service, redesigned nanotechnology service.

The company is named after founding brothers Ludwig and Josef Taprogge. Founded in 1953, the company is known for its tube cleaning systems for steam turbine condensers, heat exchangers and debris filters for water-cooled shell and tube heat exchangers and condensers.  Invention of the tube cleaning system  Josef Taprogge was a turbine engineer in a power plant nearby Essen and was responsible for the cleaning of the turbine condenser tubes. Cleaning had to be performed while the turbine was out of operation, with the power station not being able to supply any electrical energy to the grid during the turbine outage. On the other hand, the careful elimination of fouling from inside of the tubing is important for a high vacuum in the condenser and thereby for the optimal efficiency of the energy generation through water vapour. To avoid economic losses caused by shutdowns, Josef Taprogge invented a continuously working cleaning system which kept the condenser free from fouling during the operation of the steam turbine. A prototype was installed into the cooling water pipe leading to the condenser. During the time of the German Wirtschaftswunder, the process which was marketed and further developed by Taprogge GmbH was widespread and very well received in the power stations due to its efficiency. The efficiency of the power stations that are equipped with the systems increases by around 2 ‚Äì 4%. The cleaning process became well known and the name \\"Taprogge System\\" has been used in the technical literature. Tube cleaning systems A typical assortment of cleaning balls The patented process uses sponge rubber balls which are injected into the cooling water flow (1) before it enters into the condenser. The diameter of the cleaning balls is only slightly bigger than the nominal diameter of the condenser tubing. Due to their elasticity they generate a contact pressure on their way through the condenser tubes by which fouling is removed from the inner tube walls. At the condenser outlet a strainer (2) is installed in the connecting pipe which separates the balls from the water flow and feeds them into a DN 80 pipe. From there the balls are pumped back to their starting point by a 4 kW impeller pump via a DN 80 pipe. To inject the balls into the cycle, a pressure vessel with detachable cover is installed downstream of the pump. This so-called collector (3b) is equipped with a screen and a flap. At open flap, the balls can pass and with closed flap they remain in the collector and can be replenished or exchanged. The process works continuously and the tubes remain free of mud, algae, bacteria and scaling. The operation of the system is monitored via sight glasses and electronic measuring instruments. The screen surfaces are arranged on shafts with pivoted bearings and can be turned on demand to have fouling removed by the water flow. In this process the balls are caught in the collector. This time-consuming procedure is automatized (3c), gear motors (M) operate the relevant actuators. The minal diameters of the screens have been adjusted to respond to the developments in power station technology and are produced in sizes from nominal diameter 150 mm to 3600 mm. The cleaning ball diameters range from 14 to 30 mm and filling one collector normally requires several hundred of them. However, some cleaning systems can require well over a thousand cleaning balls. The lifetime of the cleaning balls which are produced of biodegradable natural rubber is around 4 weeks. A specialized technology is the production of tube cleaning systems for seawater desalination plants. As the heated seawater called brine has a particularly corrosive effect, excellent corrosion resistant yet heat conducting materials (like Titanium) have to be used for such systems. Due to the large tube diameters in the evaporators, the cleaning balls have diameters of up to 45 mm. Debris filtration systems Backwash filter with large nominal diameter In the 1970s, the product range was extended by backwash filters to protect the heat exchangers and condensers from macro fouling, like stones, pieces of wood, fibres, plastic sheeting, and mussels. Foreign matter will first settle on the filter surface. As fouling builds up, differential pressure between filter inlet and outlet increases and the filter has to be cleaned by backwashing. For this purpose an electrically driven rotor covers the filter surface which is connected with a pipe leading outside. Installed in this pipe is a valve that is opened during the backwash process. The accumulated fouling is drawn off and discharged via the pipe which, downstream of the condenser, leads to the main cooling water pipe or a debris container. This technology was spread in power stations and industrial plants the world over. Depending on the flow rates to be filtered, the filters are produced in nominal diameters from 150 mm to DN 3200 mm. The filter surface consists of stainless steel with punched holes. For difficult types of debris, filter surfaces of plastic or grids can be used. A further type produced by the company are fine filters with filtration degrees from 50 to 1000 Œºm. Water intake systems Airflushed intake filter called TAPIS Since the late 1990s, Taprogge offers another filter system which retains fouling already at the intake into the cooling water system ‚Äì in this way the entire system and the long cooling water pipes can be protected. The system called TAPIS (Taprogge Air Powered Intake System) is installed in the water at the cooling water pipe inlet in the form of a polyhedral housing with plain filter surfaces. It is cleaned by pressurized air blast. In contrast to submarine rakes for seaborne matter, the stainless steel filter has no moving parts and masters biggest water flows. The filter surfaces are made of coated plastic provided with drilled holes. Literature * Heat Exchanger Fouling, Fundamental Approaches and Technical Solutions; Editor: Prof.Dr.-Ing.

Life Otto I was born into the House of Ascania as the eldest son of Albert I (\\"Albert the Bear\\"), who founded the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1157, and his wife Sophie of Winzenburg. He had three sisters and six brothers, the best known of whom were Prince-Archbishop Siegfried of Bremen, and Count Bernhard of Anhalt, later Duke of Saxony. Otto's year of birth is traditionally recorded as 1128, but recent historians have cast some doubts on the date. Pribislav of the Havolanes is known to have served as Otto's godfather and given the lands of Zauche bordering the Ascanian possessions as a gift upon the occasion; Partenheimer (2003) dates that event to 1123 or 1125. In 1148, Otto married Judith of the Piast dynasty, sister of the Dukes of Poland Boleslaw IV and Mieszko III. Arrangements for the marriage were agreed upon during the Wendic Crusade (one of the Northern Crusades) in a meeting of January 6, 1148, in which Archbishop Friedrich of Wettin participated besides Otto and the two Polish dukes. According to Partenheimer (2003), the marriage was contracted in connection with the Ascanian efforts to support the Piast dynasty in opposition to King Conrad, who supported Wladyslaw II as legal ruler of Poland. After Judith's death in 1175, Otto married Ada of Holland in 1176, daughter of Floris III, Count of Holland. Otto and Judith had: * Otto II became his successor as Margrave of Brandenburg at Otto I's death in 1184 * Heinrich became Count of Gardelegen Otto and Ada had: * Albert II became Margrave of Brandenburg after the death of his brother Otto II in 1205 Otto was buried in the Lehnin Abbey, which he had helped build. Margrave of Brandenburg =Alongside his father (to 1170)= Otto governed from 1144 alongside his father Albert. He did not officially take the title Margrave of Brandenburg until his father's death in 1170, but as early as 1144 he is mentioned by that title along with Albert in a royal document, although Albert himself did not claim it until 1157. The father and son together shaped the House of Ascania's policy over several decades, together participating in meetings and decisions, and are both frequently mentioned in documents of the period. The pair were accompanied and supported in many cases by Otto's brothers, in particular the second-eldest, Hermann. Otto outlived his father, who lived to the then very old age of 70, by only 14 years. =Sole ruler (1170‚Äì1184)= The Margraviate of Brandenburg, which Otto finally took over from his father in 1170, did not at the time correspond to the later territory of Brandenburg. The old Margraviate was essentially only the eastern portion of Havelland and the Zauche. In the following 150 years under the Ascanians, it would expand to include many more regions, but during Otto's years as Margrave, his main goal was to stabilize and secure the Margraviate by intensifying settlement in the regions he controlled. Lehnin Abbey Lehnin Abbey ruins, 1858, by Eduard Gaertner =Founding by Otto I= In 1180, Otto founded the Lehnin Abbey in Zauche as the Margraviate's first monastery, in which he would be buried four years later. This Cistercian monastery became the house monastery and burial ground for the House of Ascania, and later also for the House of Hohenzollern. The first monks took up residence in 1183, coming from the Sittichenbach Abbey; construction of the church and cloisters began around 1190. The monastery quickly developed into a wealthy abbey and strengthened the position of the Ascanians both by its great economic means and by the missionary work of its monks to the Slavs. By the time the monastery was secularized in 1542, it owned among other things 39 villages and the city of Werder. =Founding legend= Monument group, with abbot Sibold (left) and F√ºrst Pribislaw The abbey's founding legend is as follows. Otto fell asleep after an arduous hunt under an oak tree. In his dream, deer appeared which threatened to gore him with their antlers, and which he could not repel with his spear. In desperation Otto called Christ's name, whereupon the dream dissolved. When Otto related the strange dream to his companions, they interpreted the deer as a symbol for the pagan Slavs, and advised him to establish a monastery in honor of the Christian God to defend against paganism. Oak and deer as a result are on the Abbey's coat of arms. Monument to Otto I in Berlin A monument to Otto was built by the sculptor Max Unger in 1898 on the former Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) in Tiergarten in Berlin, as part of the construction of a \\"boulevard of splendor\\" with monuments from the history of Brandenburg and Berlin (with the commissioning by Emperor William II). Under the direction of Reinhold Begas between 1895 and 1901, 27 sculptors created 32 sculptures of the rulers of Brandenburg and Prussia, each 2.75 m (9 ft) high. Each sculpture was flanked by two smaller busts of people who played an important role in the life of that ruler. In the case Otto I, the flanking busts were of his godfather Pribislav and the first Abbot of the Lehnin Abbey, Sibold, who according to legend was murdered.

The song was the second collaboration between Springfield and Pet Shop Boys, following their UK #2 and US #2 hit duet \\"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\\" in 1987. \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\" prominently features an orchestral arrangement by Angelo Badalamenti and a soprano saxophone solo by Courtney Pine. Marshall Jefferson provided a dance mix which appeared on the 12\\" and CD singles. \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\" was produced for the 1989 film Scandal, an account of the Profumo affair, a famous British political scandal in 1963 which severely undermined confidence in the ruling Conservative Party government. The song is heard over the end credits of the film. When film producer Stephen Woolley invited Pet Shop Boys to submit a song for the soundtrack, Neil Tennant remembered a song he had written some years earlier, before the formation of the duo. He and Chris Lowe wrote new music for the song, and with Woolley's approval asked Dusty Springfield to sing it. According to Tennant, Woolley liked the idea of having the song performed by someone who was already well-known at the time of the Profumo affair; in 1963, Dusty was lead singer of the popular group the Springfields and was just about to launch her solo career. The lyrics of the song describe in roughly chronological order the actual course of events and mention, by first name only, the main characters involved: Mandy Rice-Davies, Christine Keeler and Stephen Ward, as well as Lucky Gordon, Johnny Edgecombe and Vickie Barrett. The song also references the popular culture of the time with the line \\"Please Please Me's number one\\", a reference to The Beatles' debut album which dominated the sales charts for much of the year and was, as described in the song, number one both at the time of Profumo's resignation in May 1963, and the conclusion of Ward's trial at the end of July.The single of the same name was also listed as a number one hit in several charts of the time, however this occurred in February and early March 1963, some time before the events recounted in the song. \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\" made #16 in the UK and led to further chart success for Springfield. \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\", was later included as a track on Springfield's successful comeback album Reputation, released in 1990. Pet Shop Boys would later accept another commission from Woolley, to produce music for the 1993 film The Crying Game. The original Pet Shop Boys demo recording of \\"Nothing Has Been Proved\\", with lead vocals by Neil Tennant, was included on the expanded re-issue of their 1988 album Introspective in 2001. Music video The music video shows Springfield in the studio along with a Christine Keeler lookalike being interviewed with camera flash bulbs going off. Along with these come short reels from the film Scandal starring Joanne Whalley, John Hurt, Ian McKellen, Britt Ekland, and Bridget Fonda as well as original news footage from 1963.

It was released in early 1959 on the Riverside label. History Everybody Digs Bill Evans was Evans's second album, done two years after his first record as a leader. Though his producer (Orrin Keepnews) had wanted Evans to record a follow-up album to his debut sooner, the self-critical Evans felt he had \\"nothing new to say\\" before this album. The recording captures Evans at a time when he frequently played extended musical ideas using block chords, a technique also favored by Milt Buckner, George Shearing, Oscar Peterson, and other jazz pianists. That combined with his use of pedals gave him a sound considered by critics to be innovative. Though Evans had quit the Miles Davis band a month before the album was recorded, Davis was enamored of Evans' piano sound as it was developing through 1958, and decided to use him as the pianist for four of the five tracks on the 1959 recording Kind of Blue. Everybody Digs Bill Evans was reissued in 1987 with one bonus track. Reception Writing for Allmusic, music critic Michael G. Nastos called the album \\"a landmark recording for the young pianist... Though not his very best effort overall, Evans garnered great attention, and rightfully so, from this important album of 1958.\\" Samuel Chell of All About Jazz wrote: \\"With its varied tempos, rhythms and programming, Everybody Digs Bill Evans sustains interest without allowing the listener for a moment to mistake the singular, inimitable voice of the leader. It's not hard to understand why many Evans followers, 'casual' and otherwise, list it as their favorite of the pianist's recordings. It's doubtful there's a more introspective, meditative trio set on record, yet the pianist shows he can dance as well.\\" It was voted number 3 in the 50 All-Time Overlooked Jazz Albums from Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums.

Career Gould began her blogging career as one half of The Universal Review before starting her own blog, Emily Magazine, and writing for Gawker.com on a freelance basis. Before joining the Gawker staff, Gould was an associate editor at Disney's Hyperion imprint.

Controversies = Gawker Stalker and Jimmy Kimmel = On April 6, 2007, Gould appeared on an episode of Larry King Live hosted by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel during a panel discussion titled \\"Paparazzi: Do they go too far?\\" During the interview, Kimmel accused Gould of irresponsible journalism resulting from Gould's popular blog and the \\"Gawker Stalker\\" feature, which allowed users to update the whereabouts of celebrities in New York City. Kimmel mentioned the possibility of assisting real stalkers, adding that Gould and her website could ultimately be responsible for someone's death, and that Gawker.com's content was frequently untruthful. Gould stated that the section of the website represented \\"citizen journalism\\" and went on to say that no one expected everything in the section to be true. The interview attracted media attention and resulted in an overwhelmingly negative response for Gould. On May 4, 2007, Gould reacted to the interview in an op-ed she wrote for The New York Times. A lengthy article she wrote about her experiences with Gawker.com was the New York Times Magazine cover story on May 25, 2008. In it, she described how the negative response to her television appearance caused her to suffer panic attacks, which led her to seek therapy. In a March 2020 article, Gould recounts the incident and discusses the concept of shame in relation to it. = Lena Dunham feud = Gould has also attracted criticism and controversy for her public feud with the actor and writer Lena Dunham. In her novel Friendship, Gould discussed an evening she spent with Dunham when they met at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend who lives in the same Brooklyn Heights building as Dunham. Gould mentioned how Dunham's success made her jealous and spoke about the encounter in several media interviews during the promotion of Friendship. Girls showrunner Jennifer Konner later posted several negative tweets in response to Gould's article in The New York Times. Dunham unfollowed Gould on Twitter and, according to Gould, direct-messaged her saying \\"you fully suck, I was going to promote your book but you need to get a better talk show story,\\" referring to Gould having spoken about her on talk shows and in interviews. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Gould revealed that she was \\"very upset\\" about the public fallout with Dunham and that she remains \\"a big fan\\" of hers.

Life Born in 1564, he was the oldest son of Elizabeth Strachan and her husband William Forbes, laird of Corse. He attended the High School of Stirling, the University of Glasgow and then the University of St Andrews. At St Andrews, he came under the influence of the renowned theologian Andrew Melville. In 1598, Forbes's father died, leaving him his estate. Forbes became religiously puritanical and an avid preacher, though he was reluctant to enter the ministry. George Gledstanes, Archbishop of St Andrews, ordered him to enter the ministry or stop preaching, and as a result Forbes confined his preaching to his own household. At the death of his friend John Chalmers, the minister of Keith, in 1611, the dying Chalmers requested Forbes to take control of the parish of Keith and continue his work there. So it was that in 1612, aged forty-eight, Forbes received his ordination into the ministry and became minister of Keith, in the diocese of Moray. Forbes left a number of theological writings from this period, including An Exquisite Commentarie upon the Revelation of Saint John (1613) and Short Discovery of the Adversarie (1614). In the former, he was vehemently anti-Catholicism and argued that the Catholic Church had become corrupted by the greed of bishops even before the reign of the Emperor Constantine the Great, becoming irrecoverable during the papacy of Pope Boniface VIII. In the latter work, he moderated his views on episcopacy, but still declared bishoprics to be unnecessary institutions. In January 1618, Forbes was given the crown nomination to succeed Alexander Forbes as Bishop of Aberdeen, after receiving an unsuccessful nomination two years previously. He was elected on 24 March, obtained royal provision on 8 April and received consecration of 17 May. Forbes was apparently initially reluctant to take up the position, but cited his obedience to the king's wishes. Taking up a bishopric necessarily meant that he encountered some hostility from the anti-episcopal presbyterians in the Church of Scotland, but Forbes was nevertheless well respected for his piety and theology. His summer residence was Tullynessle Tower in Tullynessle, Aberdeenshire. As Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, Forbes was responsible for much reorganisation in the university, including reconstruction of the system for education and training future ministers. Forbes began to suffer from apoplexy and died on 28 March 1635. He was buried in Aberdeen Cathedral. Family He married Lucretia Spens, daughter of David Spens of Wormiston and sister of James Spens, and by her fathered five children, one of whom was the noted theologian John Forbes.

He has had several important solo exhibitions including one at NUS Museum, Singapore, Galerie Sylvia Bernhardt, Germany and Pavillon du Centanarie/Arcelor Mittal, Luxembourg. In 2013, Ratnadeep exhibited at the prestigious Deutsche Oper Berlin a series of works titled 'The Golden Ear- A Tribute to Wagner', based on German Composer Richard Wagner and mainly his epic opera \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\" (Ring of Nibelungs). The work revolves around Ratnadeep's philosophical interpretation with connection to especially to Indo-Global mythological context with contemporary times. He has participated in many group exhibitions like 'Sarang', Seoul, Korea; Pictures of Asia, Larasati, Singapore; 'Indian contemporary art', Chelsea College of Arts, UK; Uneo Royal Museum, Japan; Ao~rta Project, BBK Kunst Forum, D√ºsseldorf and Ausstellungshalle Innenhafen, Duisburg, Germany. He has received a number of awards and scholarships. Ratnadeep lives and works in Mumbai, India and Berlin, Germany. Early life and education Ratnadeep Adivrekar was born in 1974 in Mumbai, India. He is the son of artist Gopal S. Adivrekar. He received his BFA in painting with first class in 1997 from the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Mumbai.  About Work  Ratnadeep Gopal Adivrekar is an artist whose work defies easy definitions, having experimented with a wide range of styles and subject matter, bringing together metaphors from contradictory or unpredicted sources, both historical and contemporary, by using diverse materials and techniques. In fact Ratnadeep's artistic multiplicity, and his resistance to any form of categorisation, can be seen as the consistent theme in his work. The parts of painting have naturalist approximate based on photographic documentations. When a photograph is painted on canvas, the sense of realness in the images are complicated, while they may retain a high degree of verisimilitude, the loss of its mechanical tie to a specific situation. While our eyes perceive these paintings as photography, conceptually we know they are individual interpretations. Ratnadeep has rejected mechanical processes, preferring to explore the visual effects of mechanical technology by hand. Ratnadeep's paintings have usually used techniques which are both time-consuming and physically demanding. Buried within this elaborate surface sometimes are sheets of manipulated expressive color drips transparent enough and mark making, bringing out the rawness of improvisation. In Ratnadeep's works the original source or elements from photographic motifs are patched together in new constellations of allegories thus the paintings have a sort of leaping structure of narratives within narratives. Ratnadeep creates works that have an open-ended narrative and evoke the idea of exploring eternal subjects like existence, death, understanding different facets of philosophy. His work refers directly to the enigma of metamorphosis and his imagery whispers to the subconscious coaxing it to the surface. Making us aware of Ratnadeep's beliefs, the richness of his symbolism but yet mysterious eluding the logically understandable things and combine to make new resonances. He plays with the associational nature of thinking and how often a deliberate act of misunderstanding that can become poetry on canvas. Crowd scenes have become a constant feature in his work in recent years, the systematic-chaos or chaotic- system of crowds from processions and rallies to battles and concerts. The high-octane energy and movement of large gatherings is a reminder, perhaps, of the potential of the crowd or organised mass. Quotes \\"Born in family of artists, I have a miniscule gap between art and life. My works are evidence of exploration, a commentary on art, contemporary life by combining images and forms to construct on human reality. Our socio-politically fragmented society is saturated with opulence of images, which signify ideas of radical modernist utopia. As an archivist of the new world, processing these images and forms has its origin based in experiences, which leads to the relationship between our sense of philosophies, self and world.

My paintings deal with subjects that carry a historical set of references, but collective memory is constantly challenged by enigmatic prophetic actions, concealed in personal folds of the temporal linearity‚Ä¶I believe I am an observer from distant at humanity with deliberation to miniscule details.\\" \\\\- Ratnadeep Gopal Adivrekar'' Work Ratnadeep's desire to see everything at once is apparent in many of his paintings, perhaps most overtly in the overlay of one image on top of others, as if it were possible not just to see through a particular image but to hold them both in a sort of suspension. In these superimposed, suspended and translucent images the structure of narratives is overt. Each of the images is both there and not- there, as the eye is drawn from one to the other. Ratnadeep's works invite the spectator to consider. His task is to reintroduce their significance into a tension with form ‚Äì but without allowing the images he uses to fall into utter nostalgia. His work is to help the spectator re-evaluate the power of the static image, its ability to make reference to our histories and its power to reinvoke our thoughts and our participation through small acts of attention. 6From catalogue \\"Proverbial In(ter)ventions 2009\\" Exhibitions =Solo Exhibitions= *2017 ‚Äì ‚Äò8 Stories‚Äô, Galerie Mukadam, Berlin, Germany *2014 ‚Äì 'Parallax Views', Tao Art Gallery, Mumbai *2013 ‚Äì 'The Golden Ear- A Tribute to Wagner', Seminarhaus Bayreuth, Deutsche Oper, Berlin & Kameha, Frankfurt *2013 ‚Äì 'Infinite Range of Responses to Time', Galerie Sogan & Art, Singapore *2011 ‚Äì Discourse of prismatic truths at Pavillon du Centanarie/Arcelor Mittal, Luxembourg. *2010 ‚Äì Allegories of talking road at Galerie Sylvia Bernhardt, Germany. *2010 ‚Äì Crimson Art Gallery, Bangalore. *2009 ‚Äì Proverbial In(ter)vention, NUS Museum, Singapore. *2004 ‚Äì Refraction of ideas, Artists Centre, Mumbai. *2000 ‚Äì Souvenirs from journeys within solo exhibition at Kala Academy, Panaji. *1999 ‚Äì Exhibition at Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai. *1998 ‚Äì Memoirs of the unreal city and findings through journeys.

Ak ºab ºal wrote in his native language of K ºiche º, and then translated his poetry into Spanish. With the translations of his works into numerous languages and international recognition, Ak ºab ºal is considered to be \\"the most renowned Maya Ki ºche º poet\\" in the world and one of the best known Guatemalan writers in Europe and Latin America.  Early life  Ak ºab ºal was born in 1952 in Momostenango, Totonicap√°n. His formal education ceased at age twelve, when he left school to help financially support his family. He worked in his village as a shepherd and weaver, until leaving to find work in Guatemala City as a street vendor and porter. Despite his grandfather's cautions that ‚Äúbooks can make you lose your mind,‚Äù Ak ºab ºal decided to venture into the world of poetry. His mother actually served as a source of support and influence in this choice, as she \\"planted in [him] an interest in the word\\" as a way to \\"continue [his] elders' tradition.\\"  Career  = Translations = Ak ºab ºal originally began writing his poetry in Spanish, \\"because he was 'illiterate' in his own mother tongue,\\" but eventually started to write in K ºiche º in the 1980s. Despite the fact that his own Spanish translations made his works available to a wider audience, Ak ºab ºal was unable to find a publisher interested in printing his K ºiche º work until 1993. Since gaining popularity, Ak ºab ºal's poetry has been translated into many different languages, including French, English, Estonian, Scots, German, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Hungarian, Arabic, and Italian. = Reception = Many scholars have praised Ak ºab ºal's work as an expression of his indigenous tradition. Literary critic Carlos Montemayor said that \\"Humberto Ak ºabal embodies indigenous consciousness, its languages, its greatness, its spirituality, its music, its songs, as well as the consciousness of Latin America itself.\\" Spanish poet Antonio Gamoneda described Ak ºabal's poetry in terms of its ‚Äúessential humbleness, its elementary sacredness, through which you feel the pulse of words that reveal deeds, things, beings of nature‚Äù. Chilean historian Miguel Rojas Mix wrote that ‚ÄúAk ºabal sings like the birds, speaks K ºiche º Maya and thinks like we ºd wish most men thinked.‚Äù  Awards  Ak ºab ºal has been given many awards and honors from around the globe, including: *(1993) the Quetzal de Oro from the Guatemalan Association of Journalists. *(1995) a Diploma Emeretissimum from the Humanities faculty of University of San Carlos of Guatemala. *(1997) the Swiss Blaise Cendrars prize. *(1998) the Premio Continental Canto de Am√©rica UNESCO prize. *(2004) the \\"Pier Paolo Pasolini\\" international poetry prize. *(2005) a Chevalier (Knight) membership of the Order of Arts and Letters (Ordre des Arts et des Lettres) from the French Ministry of Culture. *(2006) the Guggenheim Fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, N.Y.

Ak ºabal's book Guardi√°n de la ca√≠da de agua (or \\"Guardian of the Waterfall\\" in English) was named book of the year by Association of Guatemalan Journalists and in 1993 received their Golden Quetzal award. In 1995 he received an honorary degree from the Department of Humanities of the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. In 2004 he declined to receive the Guatemala National Prize in Literature because it is named for Miguel √Ångel Asturias, whom Ak ºabal accused of encouraging racism. He said Asturias' 1923 essay The Social Problem of the Indian, \\"Offends the indigenous peoples of Guatemala, of which I am part.\\" The young Asturias proposed a program of eugenics ‚Äîfocused on the assimilation of Guatemala's Indians into its mestizo (in local usage ‚Äúladino‚Äù) population‚Äî as a remedy to the ills of the Guatemalan nation, a process he would promote by encouraging European immigration.

In simple configurations of the laser cavity or laser resonator, the coupling parameter may be just the transmission coefficient of the output coupler or just square of the magnification coefficient in the case of unstable resonator. The round-trip loss may limit the power scaling of the active mirrors, or disk lasers, while the size of the gain medium scales up, and the gain size product is limited by the exponential growth of the amplified spontaneous emission; the powerful disk laser should work at low values of the coupling parameter and even lower values of the round-trip loss.

He was the first person to publicly refuse to deploy in Iraq. Background Stephen Funk decided to enlist in the United States Marine Corps after 9/11, signing a six-year contract in February 2002. Near the end of boot camp, he shot expert at the rifle range, at 200-, 300- and 500-yards. Despite this, his instructor told him that he would not shoot as well in combat; Funk later said, \\"I told him he was right, because I felt killing was wrong.\\" Prior to enlisting, Funk had a background in social activism having attended a politically charged alternative high school called The Nova Project. He participated in protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle and the during the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. His period of \\"unauthorized absence\\" lasted from February 9, 2003, to April 1, 2003. On April 1, 2003, Funk held a press conference at the main gate of San Jose Marine Reserve Base and turned himself over to military authorities. During the conference, Funk spoke to reporters and said \\"There is no way to justify war because you're paying with human lives.\\" Just before being taken into custody. Funk had attempted to obtain conscientious objector status and a discharge. His conscientious objector application was never reviewed, instead he was court-martialed. At the same time he applied for conscientious objector status, Funk also came out publicly as a gay man. In 2003, while imprisoned, he was named as one of OUT Magazine's \\"Out 100\\". Military punishment Of the two charges Funk was brought up on, a military jury acquitted him on September 6, 2003, of desertion, but convicted him of the lesser charge of unauthorized absence. He had spent 47 days of unauthorized absence preparing his application for conscientious objection and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, reduction in rank from E-3 to E-1 and given a bad-conduct discharge. Controversy It is noteworthy that the United States punished him \\"for refusing to report to his unit during the Iraq war,\\" during the period of his \\"unauthorized absence\\" (Feb 9, 2003 to April 1, 2003), which occurred before the May 22, 2003, adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483. (That resolution affirmed that the United States and the United Kingdom had responsibility for Iraq as the \\"occupying powers under unified command.\\") This sequence of events means that United States punished Stephen Funk for refusing to \\"report to his unit during [a] war\\" not sanctioned by the United Nations. This fact has major implications in international law: In an interview given on August 25, 2006, about the \\"2003 invasion of Iraq,...[ Benjamin B. Ferencz, an American lawyer ],...said the United Nations charter, which was written after the carnage of World War II, contains a provision that no nation can use armed force without the permission of the UN Security Council.\\"Glantz, A.: Bush and Saddam Should Both Stand Trial, Says Nuremberg Prosecutor, OneWorld U.S., August 25, 2006. URL last accessed 2006-12-12. Ferencz is qualified to make comparisons to the Nuremberg Trials because he, himself, was an investigator of Nazi war crimes after World War II and the Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, one of the twelve military trials held by the U.S. authorities at Nuremberg, Germany. One of the legal principles used during those trials was Nuremberg Principle IV which deals with the responsibility of individuals. It states, \\"The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.\\"International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) References Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the N√ºremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950: Introduction The precedents and principles of international law that were set during the Nuremberg Trials have legal relevance to all subsequent cases, including that of Stephen Funk. Aftermath Stephen Funk was confined in the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base Brig and served 5 months of a 6-month sentence. During his confinement, antiwar activists organized a major protest outside the base along with a bus tour of speakers traveling the east coast. It was coordinated with rallies in several major cities including San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, New Orleans, Paris, & London. Upon release Funk returned to the San Francisco Bay Area enrolling at Stanford University to study international relations. Upon graduation, Condoleezza Rice, now a professor at the school, handed Funk his degree.

Arms are borne by individuals, official bodies, local authorities, military units, and by a wide variety of organisations. South Africa has had its own heraldic authority since 1963, to provide armigers with legal protection, and to promote high standards of armorial practice. Origins and history The first known armorial display in South Africa took the form of stone beacons bearing the Portuguese Royal Arms, which were erected along the coast by navigators who explored the sea route in the 1480s. Pama, C. (1965). Lions and Virgins Some of these beacons still survive. =17th‚Äì18th centuries= Heraldry was introduced into the region by the Dutch, when they founded the first European colony, at the Cape of Good Hope, in 1652. Under Roman-Dutch law, everyone had the right to assume and bear arms, and many settlers bore personal arms, some of which are still borne by their descendants today.Pama, C.(1959) Wapens van die Ou Afrikaanse FamiliesPama, C.(1975) Families, Familiename en FamiliewapensPama,C.(1983). Die Groot Afrikaanse Familienaamboek The official arms of the Netherlands, and those of the Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie, which ran the colony, were also used. There do not appear to have been any other corporate arms during the Dutch colonial period, but there is evidence of some use of military unit arms in the 1780s.Welz, S.(1976) Cape Silver and Silversmiths Civic arms were introduced in 1804.Brownell, F.G.(1984). 'Heraldry in South Africa' in Optima =19th century= British military forces occupied the colony during the Napoleonic Wars, and the Netherlands handed it over permanently to Great Britain in 1814. This brought the colony within the jurisdiction of the English College of Arms, the Scottish Lord Lyon and the Irish Ulster Office. British law regards arms as an honour which must be granted or recognised by one or other of these authorities,Friar, S.(1987) A New Dictionary of Heraldry but as Roman-Dutch law was retained in the colony, it remained legal to simply assume arms at will. Those who wanted formal grants of arms could apply to one of the three British authorities. As with language, music, and other cultural aspects, then, British and Cape Dutch (Afrikaner) heraldry existed separately side by side. This is still the case, though there has been some cross- pollination during the past half-century. Amongst the native peoples of the region, hereditary signifiers were generally oral as opposed to pictorial in nature. Praise poetry traditions such as Isiduko and Isibongo provided peoples such as the Zulus and the Xhosas with symbolic capital in much the same way as heraldry did the British and the Cape Dutch. European settlement spread to other parts of the region in the 1830s, as a result of Afrikaner dissatisfaction with British rule. Eventually, the region crystallised into four White-ruled territories: two British colonies and two Afrikaner republics. Their governments adopted official arms.Brownell, F.G. (1993). National and Provincial Symbols =20th‚Äì21st centuries= The UK conquered the two Afrikaner republics in the Anglo-Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), and the four territories united in 1910 to form the Union of South Africa. As self- government developed during the first half of the 20th century, some official attention began to be paid to heraldry. In 1935, the Union government introduced a system of voluntary registration of \\"badges\\" by the Department of the Interior. It applied only to associations and institutions, such as schools and clubs, and several dozen of the more than 1300 items registered over the years were coats of arms.National Archives of South Africa : Data of the Bureau of Heraldry The Department of Education, Arts & Sciences took over as registrar in 1959.Department of Education, Arts & Sciences (1959). Annual Report The rise of Afrikaner nationalism during the 1930s and 1940s drew heavily on culture and tradition, and several books and articles on Afrikaner family history and heraldry were published during that period. As later research showed, the heraldic sources were generally not very reliable. After an Afrikaner nationalist government took office in 1948, with a republic high on its agenda, steps were taken to bring order to the armorial chaos. Between 1949 and 1953, the four provincial administrations introduced systems of registering civic arms to protect them against usurpation. The defence force established its own heraldry office in 1954. Calitz, G. (1995) 'A Short Chronicle of Military Heraldry in South Africa' in SAMHIC Newsletter In 1955, an inter-departmental conference recommended the formation of an official heraldic authority, and a committee appointed in 1956 recommended adopting the Swedish model, of a nominated council and an executive bureau, under the auspices of the state archives service. The 1950s also saw an unprecedented number of English and Scottish grants of arms,South African Heraldry Website to municipalities, corporate bodies, the Anglican dioceses,Brownell, F.G. (2002). Heraldry in the Church of the Province of Southern Africa and a few individuals. With a republic in the offing, there may have been a feeling that it was \\"now or never\\". South Africa became a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1961. A Heraldry Act was passed in 1962,Heraldry Act (No 18 of 1962) and the Bureau of Heraldry and Heraldry Council were established in 1963. The Bureau took over from the Department of Education, Arts & Sciences and the provincial administrations as registering authority, and in addition to registering corporate and civic arms, it registers official and personal arms too. Arms have to be heraldically correct to qualify for registration, which remains voluntary. Bureau of Heraldry. (c2002). General Information and Instructions to Applicants Matriculation, i.e. re-registration of personal arms for armigers' descendants, was authorised in 1969.Heraldry Amendment Act (No 54 of 1969) Thousands of arms have been registered and matriculated over the years. From 1963 to 1969, the Heraldry Act also provided for arms to be granted by the state president to official bodies and by the provincial administrators to local authorities. Grants were subject to Heraldry Council approval and were registered by the Bureau. (The Act has never authorised the Bureau to grant arms, only to register them.) Since 1963, the Bureau has introduced many innovations, including lines of partition, charges drawn from South African fauna and flora and the African heritage and, in the early 1970s, a highly stylised, Finnish-influenced, artistic style. Brownell, F.G. (1986) 'Finnish Influence on South African Heraldry' in Arma In 1996, during his presidency of the country, Dr. Nelson Mandela was invested as a member of the Danish Order of the Elephant by the Queen of Denmark. As he wasn't an armiger at the time of his investiture, he had a coat of arms developed by the Danish court herald which bore the colours of the South African flag. Although these arms were intended by Dr. Mandela to be subsequently used wherever a coat of arms was required internationally, he never had them registered in South Africa. Usage of arms Roman-Dutch law allows everyone to assume and bear arms, as long as no one else's rights are infringed in the process. Social status, or service to the country, are not requirements as they are in some other countries. There is therefore a wide range of armigers, including: * individual persons * national and provincial governments * local authorities, e.g. municipalities, city councils, divisional councils, district councils * government departments and agencies (though current government \\"branding\\" policy requires them to use the national arms instead)SA Government Communication & Information Services (2004). Coat of Arms Corporate Identity Guidelines * defence force units (army, air force, navy, military health service)Bureau of Heraldry (2000). Alphabetical Index to SANDF Heraldic Representations Registered with the Bureau of Heraldry * corporations * hospitals * churches (especially Anglican and Roman Catholic) * professional institutes and associations * schools, colleges, technikons, and universities * social and sports clubs. Regulation There is little regulation of heraldry in South Africa. Arms which have been registered at the Bureau are protected to the extent that a registered owner can take legal action against anyone who usurps or misuses his arms. In the case of the arms of the national and provincial governments, defence force units, and municipalities, offenders can also be prosecuted and fined, and ridiculing or showing contempt for the national arms is punishable by imprisonment.Heraldry Amendment Act (No 22 of 1982) Registration of arms is entirely voluntary. Distinctive features South African heraldry has a number of distinctive features: * the use of indigenous animals, birds, fish, trees, and flowers as charges * the use of African traditional weapons, huts, and headdress as charges * the use of elements previously described in African praise poetry as charges and/or supporters * the increasing use of Nguni shields, especially in civic arms * the occasional use of tinctures such as brunatre (brown), ochre, and tenn√© (orange), which are uncommon in European heraldry * the occasional use of an oxhide pattern for the field of a shield * a uniform pattern for the arms of family associations * uniform patterns for the arms of various types of military units * the use of trefoils and trefly lines in the arms of educational institutions to represent the three participants in the education process, i.e. students, parents, and teachers * the Bureau of Heraldry's distinctive style of artwork, introduced in the early 1970s and modified in the 1990s * the adaptation of traditional lines of partition to create special effects * the development of new lines of partition, e.g. the \\"gably\\" line based on Cape Dutch farmhouse gables, and a line suggesting an outline of Table Mountain * the development of an Afrikaans heraldic vocabulary. * Ochre, both red and yellow, appear as tinctures in South African heraldry; the national coat of arms, adopted in 2000, includes red ochre, while (yellow) ochre appears in the arms of the University of Transkei.

It stars Julie Hagerty, Jeff Goldblum, Glenda Jackson, Tom Conti, and Christopher Guest.

Their first meeting proves to be a disaster, but when they reunite sparks begin to fly. Complications ensue when bisexual Bruce's jealous live-in lover Bob decides to assert himself and do everything possible to maintain his status quo.

Ultimately, Durang's script was rewritten substantially by Altman with Durang later describing the project as \\"a very unhappy experience and outcome.\\" Despite its New York City setting, the film was made in Paris, where director Robert Altman was living at the time. Reception Siskel & Ebert gave the film \\"two thumbs down\\" on their TV program.Siskel & Ebert. Buena Vista Television. March 21, 1987. Ebert, in his print review, gave it one star out of four and called it a film \\"killed by terminal whimsy. It's a movie in which every scene must have seemed like a lot of fun at the time, but, when they're edited together, there's no pattern to the movie, nothing to build toward, no reason for us to care. It's all behavior.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film lacked \\"the kind of inexorable logic that is the fuel of any farce and makes its loony characters so funny ... The performances are good, but the film has been assembled without an overriding sense of humor and style. It remains in bits and pieces.\\"Canby, Vincent (February 27, 1987). \\"'Beyond Therapy,' A Match Made in the Ads\\". The New York Times. C8. Variety called it \\"a mediocre film version of Christopher Durang's mediocre play. The difference is that this comedy somehow won a good measure of popular success onstage, whereas the screen version is headed nowhere.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Beyond Therapy\\". Variety. January 28, 1987. 22. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four and wrote, \\"When Altman goes wrong, he usually goes spectacularly wrong‚Äîas in 'Quintet' and 'Health'‚Äîbut this time he has just gone glumly, crushingly wrong. 'Beyond Therapy' never builds up any genuine energy, direction or swing: It just huffs and puffs and eventually hyperventilates.\\"Kehr, Dave (April 24, 1987). \\"Altman's 'Beyond Therapy' is beyond hope\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 7, p. K. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times was positive, praising \\"three great comic performances\\" from \\"the juiciest cast imaginable.\\"Benson, Sheila (February 27, 1987). \\"'Therapy' Runs Wild with a Cast of Crazies\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 14. Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Beyond Therapy is a scattershot film, even more so than usual with Altman, offering a firework display of one- liners and their visual equivalents, some brilliantly funny, some less successful.\\" The film presently holds a score of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes based on eight reviews.

She has been a member of the International Best Dressed List since 1962. Early life Jacqueline Bonnin de La Bonnini√®re de Beaumont was born on 14 July 1929 in Paris to Jean de Beaumont, comte Bonnin de la Bonnini√®re de Beaumont (1904‚Äì2002) and Paule de Rivaud de La Raffini√®re (1908‚Äì1999). On 30 January 1948, Jacqueline married Vicomte √âdouard de Ribes, a successful banker who subsequently became comte de Ribes and Officer of the Legion of Honour,:fr:Cat√©gorie:Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur Croix de guerre 1939-1945.:fr:Cat√©gorie:Titulaire de la croix de guerre 1939-1945 They had two children, Elizabeth and Jean. In 1939, when she was 10, de Ribes's parents sent her and her siblings to Hendaye with a nanny during World War II. They lived in the concierge's cottage, as the main house was requisitioned by the Gestapo. Worried that the American army would land on the beaches of Hendaye and endanger their children, de Ribes's parents moved them again to the ch√¢teau of the Count and Countess Solages in central France. They shared the ch√¢teau with occupying German soldiers, and were liberated by American soldiers in 1942. After the war, Jacqueline returned to school at the convent of Les Oiseaux in Verneuil. Life in fashion and society In the 1950s and 1960s, before she began designing her own collections, de Ribes employed couture dressmakers to create custom garments for her. In the 70s she began modifying these gowns to create elaborate costumes for fancy-dress balls. In 1955 she employed Oleg Cassini to make her custom gowns based on muslin patterns de Ribes cut on the floor of her attic. She employed a young and then unknown Valentino to create the sketches that accompanied them. For twelve years de Ribes created ready-to-wear collections, using marketing techniques to attract famous and elegant international clients such as Joan Collins, Raquel Welch, Barbara Walters, Baroness von Thyssen, Cher, Danielle Steel, Olympia de Rothschild, and Marie-H√©l√®ne de Rothschild.Menkes, Suzy, \\"Couture's Grand Ladies,\\" Illustrated London News, Spring 1990.

De Ribes was unhappy with requests to change the proportions and designs of her collections for Japanese markets.

During this time she also began to suffer from celiac disease, and due to these health problems was forced to dissolve her company in 1995.

Oregon statute currently limits state appropriations to 8% of projected personal income in Oregon (with certain exceptions). If Governor declares emergency, legislature may exceed current statutory appropriations limit by 60% vote of each house.

The Oregon Constitution requires the Legislature to adopt budgets that do not exceed the revenue predicted for that same two-year period. A state law also limits general fund spending to eight percent of personal income for that same two-year period but has not affected spending to date. The \\"kicker\\" law that refunds taxes that exceed a revenue forecast made prior to the legislative session limits revenue available for state services. That constitutional amendment has refunded collected revenue to individuals seven times and corporations six times. Description of the Measure Ballot Measure 48 would have restricted the amount of money the State could spend in its annual budget. It proposed to limit state spending by amending the state's constitution to provide that, unless approved by a 2/3 vote of both the Oregon House and Senate and a subsequent approval by a majority of the voters, spending for state services in a two-year period cannot exceed the amount spent in the previous two-year period plus the combined rate of the increase of the state's population and inflation in that same, previous, two-year period. If passed, the amendment would apply to spending of aggregate revenues collected from a variety of sources including but not limited to: income tax, lottery receipts, tuition, professional licensing and other taxes and fees. The measure would not have applied to revenues from the following sources: federal funds, voluntary donations to state agencies, proceeds from the sale of bonds specifically approved by the voters and proceeds from the sale of real property at real market value to non-government entities. The measure would not apply to money spent for the following purposes: tax and \\"kicker\\" refunds or money placed in an emergency fund or a \\"rainy day\\" reserve fund. (Money placed into an emergency or \\"rainy day\\" fund would not be available for state spending in excess of the spending limit without a 2/3 vote of the House and Senate and approval by the voters.) The Legislative Fiscal Office estimated that the measure's effect in the 2007 biennium would restrict spending of approximately $2.2 billion out of approximately $35.6 billion in revenues estimated to be subject to the limit. If it had been passed and put into effect, the Legislature could refund the restricted funds to taxpayers, place them in the funds noted above, leave them in the treasury and/or, with a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature refer to voters a plan to spend them on state services. Election results During the November 7, 2006 general election and Measure 48 was rejected by a large margin, garnering only 379,971 out 1,303,600 (29.15%) of the vote on this ballot line. TAO, the main organized support for the measure received 94% of its funding from Illinois- based Americans for Limited Government, which sponsored similar measures in numerous states in 2006. Opposing groups also pooled their resources in pushing for the defeat of both Measures 41 and 48, spending $1.9 million.

She specialised in the harpsichord and clavichord, and was influential in bringing both instruments back into fashion. She was the first person to record the harpsichord, and the first to broadcast harpsichord music.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom ed., Vol. IX. pp. 360-361, Woodhouse, Violet (Kate) Gordon Family Violet Kate Eglinton Gwynne was born at 97 Harley Street, St Marylebone, London, into a wealthy family with an estate in Sussex, England. She was the second daughter and fourth of seven children of James Eglinton Anderson Gwynne (1832‚Äì1915), an engineer, inventor, and landowner, and Mary Earle Purvis (1841‚Äì1923). Her mother was a friend of soprano Adelina Patti. Violet became a pupil of the country's leading piano teacher, Oscar Beringer, a German √©migr√©, and by the age of sixteen she was one of his most promising pupils. Violet's maternal grandfather, Royal Navy officer and merchant William Purvis (1796‚Äì1854) from Dalgety Bay, Scotland, married Cornelia Louisa Intveld (1808‚Äì1857) in 1822. Intveld was a noted soprano and a great beauty of her era. Upon glimpsing her across the auditorium at the opera in London, King William IV sent his equerry to invite her to his box. When she refused, the King sent the equerry back just to ask her name. Cornelia Louisa Intveld was born in Padang where her father, who came from humble beginnings in Hellevoetsluis, South Holland, rose up through the Dutch East India Company to become the Dutch Resident of Padang. Her maternal grandmother was an Ono Niha ranee (a term that covered every rank from chieftain's daughter to princess) who married a prominent Dutch colonial official and merchant. This \\"foreign blood\\" caused opposition to Violet Gordon-Woodhouse's father's family to her parents' marriage and so they eloped. Violet was the sister of Rupert Gwynne, MP for Eastbourne from 1910-24, and Roland Gwynne, Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929-31.Cullen, Pamela V., A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams, London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006; She was the aunt of the cookery writer Elizabeth David. Violet broke off an engagement to a wealthy Sussex neighbour, Viscount Gage, after human sexuality was explained to her.Douglas-Home, Jessica, Violet: The Life and Loves of Violet Gordon Woodhouse (1997) In 1895 she entered into a mariage blanc with Gordon Woodhouse. She persuaded her husband to adopt the hyphenated surname Gordon-Woodhouse. His reasons for entering into the marriage are unclear. In 1899, William Barrington (heir to a viscountcy) moved into the marital house, joined later by Max Labouchere and Dennis Tollemache. This arrangement was referred to in society circles as the \\"Woodhouse circus\\". Career Originally, Violet played the piano, but she rose to fame playing the harpsichord and clavichord. An important influence on her was Arnold Dolmetsch, a pioneer of the early music revival, who began making copies of old keyboard instruments in the 1890s. Dolmetsch supplied Violet with instruments and gave her instruction on how to play them. In 1899 Violet performed Bach's Concerto for Three Harpsichords in C at a public concert in London. The other two harpsichordists in the Bach were Elodie Desir√©e (the second Mrs Dolmetsch) and Dolmetsch himself. Dolmetsch worked abroad in the early-20th century, but Violet resumed her collaboration with him in 1910. As well as early music repertoire, Violet played music by nineteenth century composers and living composers such as Delius, who dedicated a harpsichord piece to her. Later years After the First World War, Violet, who did not receive anything in her father's will, found herself relatively short of money. This may have been a factor in her deciding to sign a recording contract. By the 1920s, Violet and Gordon acquired Nether Lypiatt Manor in Gloucestershire, where they lived with Barrington (known as \\"Bill\\"). Finances improved after Gordon received an inheritance in 1926. Violet reduced her public performances. In the 1930s she taught the Australian keyboard player Valda Aveling. After Violet's death in 1948, aged 75, the two men remained at Nether Lypiatt until 1951, when Gordon died. She lies in the churchyard of The Church of St Peter ad Vincula, Folkington, near Eastbourne, East Sussex. A plaque to her memory and achievements can also be found on the left-hand wall inside the church. An obituary The Times was published on Monday, January 12th, 1948. The memorial to Violet Gordon-Woodhouse on the wall of the church of St Peter ad Vincula, Folkington, East Sussex. In popular culture She was close to many of the leading artists of her day, including Dame Ethel Smyth, Siegfried Sassoon, Irene, Lady Dean Paul (also known as Poldowski), and George Bernard Shaw. Welsh tramp poet W. H. Davies often visited her harpsichord recitals and also dined, with the Sitwells, at Nether Lypiatt.The Complete Poems of W. H. Davies, (ed. Daniel George), London, Jonathan Cape, 1963: pp. xxvii-xxxiv, \\"Introduction\\" by Osbert Sitwell * Sir Osbert Sitwell mentions her often in his autobiography. * Radclyffe Hall, the lesbian novelist, dedicated a book of erotic poems to her. * Roger Scruton wrote the libretto and music for an opera, Violet, based on her life, which premiered in 2005 at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Discography =Harpsichord= Gordon-Woodhouse is claimed to be the first person recorded playing the harpsichord in 1920. Some of her recordings have been released on CD. The composers featured include J.S. Bach. =Clavichord= Violet also made clavichord recordings, but she was not the first person to record the instrument, an honour that appears to belong to Arnold Dolmetsch.

It has the distinction of being the first artistic movement of its kind in both Bengal and all of India. Though short-lived ‚Äì the group disbanded in 1953 ‚Äì the Calcutta Group was instrumental in the transformation of contemporary Indian art and brought this genre onto the world stage.

After traveling to London for a few years in order to hone his artistic skills, he moved back to India with the idea of creating a group for plastic artists. Along with fellow painters Nirode Mazumdar, Rathin Maitra, Prankrishna Pal and Gopal Ghosh, he formally created the Calcutta Group in 1943. Later that year, another painter, Paritosh Sen, along with sculptors Pradosh Das Gupta, Kamala Das Gupta joined the society. These eight members were known as the organization's core, as well as the driving force behind it. Over the years, other artists joined the group as well including Abani Sen in 1947, Gobardhan Ash in 1950, Sunil Madhav Sen in 1952, and Hemanta Mistra in 1953.  Philosophy  During this period of time, Bengal - a state in India, home to many of the group's members - had been facing many tragedies including wars, famines, massacres, and even the partition of the country. Stemming from these events, the members of the Calcutta Group focused not on aesthetic, but on the social and political realities of the state and nation at the time. Many of the group's members were actually sympathetic towards the Communist Party that was making its way through India and some were even militants themselves. The group's manifesto was a synthesis of all of these ideas that stressed two main points: renouncement of religion in art and creation of opportunities for Indian art to modernize. The first idea was meant to remove the evils of demagoguery and elitism and produce works that focused on the population as a whole. However, the dismissal of works based n Hindu mythology came across as anti-religious and even atheist and therefore shocked many, leading to the moniker \\"Artistic Scandal\\".

Neo-Grec style, constructed of cream faience with some decorative blue, green and black faience, with its unique semi-circular design and blue domed roof; there is no other in the United Kingdom. It has a main arena, middle and upper balconies for seating and originally seated 3,500 but with current health and safety laws this has been reduced to 1,600. The building of the bandstand formed part of the main seafront improvements, the bandstand itself cost ¬£28,000 and was surmounted with a stainless steel spire. The project engineer was Leslie Rosevere. The first concerts were given on the 28 July 1935 with a total of 10,400 attending all three concerts and paying 3d each. With an audience of 8,000, the bandstand was officially opened on the 5 August 1935 by the Lord Lieutenant of the county, Lord Leconfield. For many years the bandstand played host to a full programme of military bands. On a daily basis the bands would play from Easter until the end of October. Over the years this was reduced, mainly because audience number was dropping and in 2001 action had to be taken as the costs of the military bands were far out weighing the audience receipts. The local civilian bands were attracting similar audiences to those of military. It was therefore decided that the military band be cut further. If the bandstand were to survive as a musical entertainment venue, new audiences and entertainments had to be found. The introduction of big band nights, rock 'n' roll, Last Night of the Proms and 1812 Firework Night was a significant component of the filling of the financial gap. In 2006, these actions saw the introduction of tribute concerts, which were hugely successful, resulting in the attraction of a significantly larger audience, reviving the bandstand. Eastbourne Bandstand Tribute Show The bandstand to this day plays an important part in the musical entertainment on the south coast offering around 150 concerts per year. There is a commemorative plaque opposite the bandstand in memory of Eastbourne bandsman John Wesley Woodward, who was one of those playing on the Titanic when it sank on 15 April 1912. In recent years the bandstand has featured in numerous television programmes such as Foyle's War, and is shown in the opening sequence of BBC South East Today.

In a mobile enterprise, employees use mobile devices to do any or all of the following: access email, manage projects, manage documents, provide customer relationship management, conduct enterprise resource planning, fill out invoices and receipts, accounting vouchers, work orders, purchase orders, etc. and manage a corporate calendar and address book. These are the most common applications though many other corporate mobile applications are being developed and used by organizations around the world. A mobile enterprise generally implies aggressive use of mobile technology facilitated by Internet-based data transmissions. As long as wireless network connectivity is available, enterprise databases can be remotely accessed and updated from anywhere in the world, at any time, with any device equipped with a Web browser and by anyone with permission to access such services. A mobile enterprise leverages existing Internet infrastructure and TCP/IP installations. In a mobile enterprise, mobile clients are at parity with other traditional clients such as laptop and desktop computers. The emphasis is on expedient data interchange and communication; little or no emphasis is placed on the method of access. Benefits A mobile enterprise is generally accepted to confer benefits in the areas of higher workforce productivity and employee satisfaction. Faster decision-making is another often cited benefit that results from employees having access to real-time data at the point of action, for example, during a meeting. Therefore, mobile knowledge workers (such as consultants) are one of the groups among employees which is equipped with mobile devices by their organization. However, the strategic adoption of mobile devices in enterprises often also requires a change management process. Use of mobile applications in the workplace can increase worker productivity by as much as 45 percent. Security is not a major concern anymore, since critical data is stored on servers in highly secured data centers. The mobile devices are used as terminals for information access and updates only. TLS (see IETF RFC 5246) and its predecessor SSL (see IETF RFC 6101) security protocol is deployed between the web server and the web browser on the end user device. Lost devices is not a problem since both the data and the programs reside on the servers housed in the data centers and not on the mobile devices. According to an article in CRM Guidebooks: > A recent Yankee Group survey ‚ÄúAnywhere Enterprise‚ÄìLarge: U.S. Mobility and > Applications Survey‚Äù identified that businesses can realize the following > advantages from mobile business apps: :* Increased field selling time: 28 > percent :*Eliminated redundant activities: 27 percent :*Increased win rates: > 26 percent :*Reduced sales calls costs: 25 percent :*Increased forecast > accuracy: 25 percent :*Decreased administrative time: 24 percent :*Decreased > sales cycle: 23 percent Disadvantages The mobile enterprise depends entirely on the Internet as its infrastructure. The system breaks down when a user cannot connect to the Internet. The system does not work in places where Internet service is not available. The system is disrupted whenever the Internet suffers a disruption such as when underwater data cables are damaged by earthquakes as in the case of the 2006 Hengchun earthquake or 2008 submarine cable disruption in the Middle East that disrupted internet service between the Middle East and Europe. The move to a more mobile, and dispersed, workplace is also resulting in changes to the definition of a successful employee. Some individuals, often called \\"self starters\\", can be highly effective working remotely without the influence of workmates or oversight of bosses in the same location. Others cannot, some even finding it difficult to start and complete projects without the social environment of the co-located workplace. Managers evaluating current and prospective employees must take these changes into account as they assign employees to their evolving mobile environments, attempting to match traits to workplace to maximize each employee's potential. Minimalistic approach As for all mobile applications, bandwidth economy is a major consideration. Simplicity and minimalism is of utmost importance to reduce upload and download time for best user experience.

The protests overthrew the governments of the Serbian autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, as well as the government of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, and replaced them with allies of Milo≈°eviƒá, thereby creating a dominant voting bloc within the Yugoslav presidency council. The name anti-bureaucratic revolution is derived from the proclaimed revolt against bureaucratic and corrupt governing structures. The events were condemned by the communist governments of the western Yugoslav republics (especially SR Slovenia and SR Croatia), who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolt onto their territories, and turned against Milo≈°eviƒá. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1990, and subsequently in the breakup of Yugoslavia. These protests were in support of Serbian nationalism, a centralized Yugoslavia, economic liberalism, and Milo≈°eviƒá. Prelude Since the adoption of the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Serbia and its two autonomous provinces Kosovo and Vojvodina entered into political deadlock with the provincial governments in Kosovo and Vojvodina. In 1976 the Serbian government issued its first complaints of unconstitutional practice of autonomy by the provinces to Tito and Edvard Kardelj and issued a subsequent complaint in 1984 on the matter, attempting to resolve the problems within the 1974 Constitution. It was reported that the provinces had repeatedly denied the Serbian government the ability to enact policies in their territories, such as regulation of citizenship policy, common defense law, and social plans. The situation in Kosovo became a crisis in the 1981 protests in Kosovo by Albanians who were heard shouting slogans such as \\"We are Albanians, not Yugoslavs\\", \\"Kosova Republic\\", \\"Unity with Albania\\", \\"Long live Marxism- Leninism, Down with Revisionism\\" and others. The presence of ethnic and ideological dimensions to the protestors' demands led to Yugoslav authorities deciding to forcibly stop the protests. The president of the Pristina League of Communists, Aslan Fazlia (an Albanian) said that the protests were nationalistic and counterrevolutionary and announced tough police action against the demonstrators. This action failed to quell the protests that instead grew in response with protests by Albanians sweeping across Kosovo, the President of the League of Communists of Kosovo Mahmut Bakalli decided in response to ask the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) to bring tanks onto the streets. Police reinforcements from Central Serbia were stopped by a roadblock and then Albanian demonstrators took hostages from thirty-four houses of Serbs and Montenegrins, demanding that these police forces leave Kosovo in exchange for the release of the hostages. Only after additional police forces from Pri≈°tina arrived were the hostages released. The protests led to vandalism throughout Kosovo including smashed windows of cars, shops, and state institutions. The Yugoslav leadership declared a \\"crisis situation in Kosovo\\" and all republics were requested to send their police troops to Kosovo. The Yugoslav leadership was shocked by the extent of the violence used by the demonstrators and the relatively large participation in the demonstrations. The aftermath of the 1981 protests in Kosovo resulted in resentment by Serbs in Kosovo to the political situation in Kosovo. Serbs suspected that deliberate Albanianization of Kosovo and Serbs being driven out was demonstrated by statistics showing that the population of Serbs in Kosovo had significantly decreased from 23.5% in 1961 to 13.2% in 1981, as well as making claims that they were being persecuted by Albanians including that Serb women were being systematically raped by Albanians. Many of these claims were not backed up by factual evidence but built up as popular rumours believed amongst Serbs in Kosovo. Milo≈°eviƒá took control of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's Serbian branch in September 1987, when his faction won over its opposition, led by Ivan Stamboliƒá. His rise to power coincided with Serbo- Albanian tensions in Kosovo, as Kosovo Serbs felt oppressed by Albanians and the Albanian-dominated leadership of the province. The tensions were further boosted by inflammatory reports in the Serbian media. According to the 1974 Yugoslav constitution, the two autonomous provinces of Serbia (Vojvodina and Kosovo) were largely independent from the central Serbian government, with both of them holding a seat in the Yugoslav Presidency, on a par with the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia. In effect, their status was almost equivalent to the republics', which enabled provincial leaderships of Kosovo and Vojvodina to have policies that were practically independent. In late 1987 and 1988, a populist campaign started in Serbia against this situation, which it described as untenable. Provincial leaderships were being accused of bureaucratic inefficiency and alienation from the people. Popular slogans like \\"Oh Serbia in three parts, you will be whole again\\" (–û—ò –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–æ –∏–∑ —Ç—Ä–∏ –¥–µ–ª–∞ –ø–æ–Ω–æ–≤–æ —õ–µ—à –±–∏—Ç–∏ —Ü–µ–ª–∞, oj Srbijo iz tri dela ponovo ƒáe≈° biti cela) caught on. The atmosphere was further stirred up by numerous articles and readers' letters in Serbian press, the most notorious being Politika's rubric \\"Odjeci i reagovanja\\" (Echoes and reactions), a letters to the editor column which was used as a type of astroturfing. The main points of the campaign were the following: *Serbs in Kosovo were being harassed by Albanians and suppressed by the Albanian-dominated Kosovo government *Due to the 1974 constitution, Serbia had no effective control over its provinces, whose leaderships were bureaucratic and estranged from the people *This constitution was created by the influence of the other Yugoslav republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, in order to suppress Serbia's power and create an environment for the exploitation of Serbia's natural resources *The constitution had, in effect, created a confederal type of government, as no decision could be made without the consensus of all six republics in the federal parliament; and a system with a better consideration of popular majority was called for (the slogan \\"one man, one vote\\" was one of the most popular) *Therefore, a thorough revision of the federal constitution and the enhancement of Serbian control over its provinces were necessary Protests The mass protests started in February 1986, with several meetings of Kosovo Serbs in Belgrade and in Kosovo, pleading for a resolution of the problematic situation on Kosovo. These were relatively small, with 100-5,000 participants, and were mostly reactions to individual inter-ethnic incidents. The largest such protest was held in Kosovo Polje in April 1987, gathering around 20,000 people. However, the outburst of protests began in the latter half of 1988. In June, the protest of workers of the Zmaj factory gathered 5,000 protestors; in July, meetings were held in seven towns with tens of thousands protesters, and in August in ten towns with 80,000 people. By September they spread to 39 towns with over 400,000 people. =Vojvodina (October 1988)= On 5 October 1988, around 150,000 people gathered in Novi Sad to protest against the Vojvodina provincial government. The gathering started a day earlier in the nearby town of Baƒçka Palanka, and, as Politika explained it, people spontaneously gathered and moved on to Novi Sad, the provincial capital. The protest in Baƒçka Palanka was led by Mihalj Kertes, a mid-level official of the Communist Party, an ethnic Hungarian who would later become famous for his remark \\"How can you Serbs be afraid of Serbia when I, a Hungarian, am not afraid of Serbia?\\" (and later still, as Milo≈°eviƒá's money man). Protesters from Novi Sad and other parts of Serbia gathered in huge numbers, and began the protest in front of the provincial Parliament of Vojvodina. The provincial leadership, led by Milovan ≈†ogorov, Bo≈°ko Kruniƒá and ≈Ωivan Berisavljeviƒá, were caught by surprise. Before the event, they tried to compromise and negotiate with Milo≈°eviƒá, expressing cautious support for the constitutional changes while trying to keep their and Vojvodina's position intact. However, the avalanche of media campaign orchestrated from Belgrade was about to overwhelm them; they were labelled as power-hungry \\"armchairers\\" (—Ñ–æ—Ç–µ—ô–∞—à–∏ / fotelja≈°i) and \\"autonomists\\" (–∞—É—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–∞—à–∏ / autonoma≈°i). The Vojvodina government then cut off power and water supply to protesters, a move which enraged them further still, and caused even more people from Novi Sad and its vicinity to join. When power was restored, they tried a different tactic: in order to cheer the demonstrators up, they gave them bread and yogurt. However, thousands of yogurt packages were soon thrown at the Parliament building by angry protesters. That term \\"Yogurt Revolution\\" for the protest was named after that episode. On October 6, the entire collective leadership of Vojvodina resigned and were soon replaced with Milo≈°eviƒá's men of trust Nedeljko ≈†ipovac, Radovan Pankov and Radoman Bo≈æoviƒá. The Vojvodina representative in the Central Committee of SKJ, Bo≈°ko Kruniƒá, resigned and was replaced by Stanko Radmiloviƒá, while the President of the Central Committee of the SKV, Milovan ≈†ogorov, resigned and was replaced by Bogosav Kovaƒçeviƒá. =U≈°ƒáe rally= The rally in Belgrade, at U≈°ƒáe (the large field at confluence of Sava River into Danube) was held on November 19, 1988. According to the state press, it gathered about a million people, and according to others, several hundred thousands. It was conceived as a \\"mother of all rallies\\", and a huge crowd of people come from all parts of Serbia by public and factory buses taken just for this opportunity. Milo≈°eviƒá reaffirmed his and Serbia's confinement to the principles of liberty and Serbian equity within Yugoslavia: > We will win the battle for Kosovo regardless of the obstacles placed in > front of us in the country and abroad. So, we will win regardless of the > uniting of our enemies from abroad and those in the country. And that this > nation will win the battle for freedom, is a fact well-known even to the > Turkish and German conquerors. =Montenegro= Rallies and media were also similarly used in Montenegro with the first rally in support of Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Montenegrins taking place in Titograd on 20 August 1988. The leadership of the Montenegrin Communist League was on the defense at the time, claiming that it was protecting Kosovo, but their restraint in direct support for Milo≈°eviƒá was deemed not good enough by the putschists. What eventually proved to be the coup's first act occurred on 7 October 1988 when Montenegrin police intervened against protesters in ≈Ωuta Greda demanding resignations from the Montenegrin leadership. In order to deal with the situation the leadership proclaimed the state of emergency. The state of emergency did not last long, as it was taken as an act of hostility towards Serbia by media outlets controlled by Milo≈°eviƒá as well as Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters in Montenegro. The second act started with joint rallies consisting of workers from Radoje Dakiƒá, a state-owned factory, and Veljko Vlahoviƒá University students. On 10 January 1989, over 10,000 protesters gathered in Titograd. The old leadership, confused and disorganised, soon gave in; none of them later played a significant political role. The new \\"young lions\\" of the Montenegro, Momir Bulatoviƒá, Milo ƒêukanoviƒá and Svetozar Maroviƒá, became the new leadership, strongly allied with Milo≈°eviƒá in the years to come. The League of Communists of Montenegro was subsequently transformed by the \\"triumvirate\\" who had full control over the (Socialist) Republic of Montenegro into the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, which vigorously maintained its grip over Montenegro and does so to this day more than 20 years later. =Toppling of Kosovar leadership and reduction of autonomy= Azem Vllasi and Kaqusha Jashari, the two top-ranked Kosovo politicians, were replaced in November 1988. The Albanian population of Kosovo grew restless, and in February 1989 they engaged in a general strike, particularly manifesting itself in the 1989 Kosovo miners' strike. Meanwhile, on February 28, another major rally was held in Belgrade, where the chants \\"We want weapons\\" and \\"Arrest Vllasi\\" were heard, and three days later, Vllasi was indeed placed under arrest. In early 1989, the Parliament of Serbia had proposed constitutional amendments that would have significantly reduced SAP Kosovo's autonomous status within SR Serbia. Kosovo Albanians organized large demonstrations against these moves, but in March 1989, preceding a final push for the ratification of constitutional changes in the Assembly of Kosovo, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for due process. Albanian representatives in the Parliament of Kosovo boycotted the vote on the matter on March 23, 1989, but regardless of the failure of the motion to meet the required two-thirds majority, it was declared to have passed. On March 28, the Serbian parliament approved the constitutional changes. =Gazimestan rally= The largest rally of all was held at Gazimestan on 28 June 1989, gathering two million according to Politika. =Action North= When a \\"Rally of Truth\\" () was attempted in Ljubljana, SR Slovenia in December 1989, in an action named Action North Slovene police forces prevented it with the help of Croatian police forces. This action can be considered the first Slovenian defense action against the attacks of the supporters of Milo≈°eviƒá, leading to Slovenian independence. The members of Slovene police forces who participated later organized their own veteran organization. Aftermath The anti-bureaucratic revolution affected the balance of power in the Presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia's Borisav Joviƒá (at the time the President of the Presidency), Montenegro's Nenad Buƒáin, Vojvodina's Jugoslav Kostiƒá and Kosovo's Riza Sapunxhiu, started to form a voting bloc. The reduction of provincial autonomy, but not the complete abolition of provincial status, was seen as intentional, as Milo≈°eviƒá needed the extra provincial votes to gain influence in the federal presidency. In August 1990 the Croatian Parliament replaced its representative Stipe ≈†uvar with Stjepan Mesiƒá in the wake of the Log Revolution, but Mesiƒá was only seated in October 1990 because of protests from the Serbian side. From then on, Mesiƒá joined Macedonia's Vasil Tupurkovski, Slovenia's Janez Drnov≈°ek and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Bogiƒá Bogiƒáeviƒá in opposing the demands to proclaim a general state of emergency, which would have allowed the Yugoslav People's Army to impose martial law in March 1991. When Sapunxhiu 'defected' his faction in the final vote, Joviƒá briefly resigned and returned, Buƒáin was replaced with Branko Kostiƒá, and Sapunxhiu with Sejdo Bajramoviƒá, effectively deadlocking the Presidency. Soon the country descended into the Yugoslav Wars.

NAKASEC is based in Los Angeles and a D.C. office opened in late 2008. NAKASEC was founded in 1994 by local community centers to project a national progressive voice and promote the full participation of Korean Americans as a part of a greater goal of building a national movement for social change. NAKASEC was one of the major players in the Korean American community during the restoration movement after the welfare reform of 1996 through the \\"Fix '96 Campaign\\" and continues to be active in the immigration reform debate.  History  KRC along with other centers in Seattle, Washington, DC, Houston and other cities, were established in the early 1980s by political activists who escaped South Korea after Chun Doo-hwan's military leadership crushed the Gwangju People's Uprising in May 1980. From the onset, the center set as its goals the delivery of social services, community education, rights advocacy, and preservation and enrichment of traditional cultures and work on identity. During the 1980s, it focused its advocacy in solidarity work with the democratization movement of South Korea, exposing grave human rights violations committed by the Chun regime.Lee, Eun Sook. 2005 The Political Awakening of Korean Americans In Koreans in the Windy City: 100 Years of Korean Americans in the Chicago Area. Pp. 337-350. Hyock Chun, Kwang Chung Kim and Shin Kim, eds. New Haven, CT: East Rock Institute for the Centennial Publication Committee of Chicago. Because of its open challenge to the then dictatorial state of South Korea, KRC was a target of covert repression and kidnap attempts by the KCIA and the Korean Consulate. With the Los Angeles Civil Unrest of 1992 and the anti- immigrant wave that swept across California with Proposition 187 in 1994, KRC steered its direction to issues of the Korean American community in Los Angeles, particularly around political education, civil rights and the defense of immigrant rights. In 1994, KRC and other sister centers across the United States, including YKASEC in New York City and KRCC in Chicago, founded the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium (NAKASEC, ÎØ∏Ï£ºÌïúÏù∏Î¥âÏÇ¨ÍµêÏú°Îã®Ï≤¥ÌòëÏùòÌöå), a national civil rights organization with a progressive Korean American agenda. Under the leadership of NAKASEC, centers fought against Proposition 187, held community education on issues of race, and formed a broad coalition in the Korean American community against the Welfare Reform of 1996. Through a community fundraiser involving thousands of individuals, a full-page ad was posted in the Washington Post in 1997 demanding the president to end the attack on immigrants, and a campaign to restore welfare benefits for immigrants was launched in the late 1990s, winning back various benefits for lawful permanent residents and other immigrants. Many Korean American seniors became politicized during this struggle for benefits.Lee, Eun Sook. 2005 The Political Awakening of Korean Americans In Koreans in the Windy City: 100 Years of Korean Americans in the Chicago Area. Pp. 337-350. Hyock Chun, Kwang Chung Kim and Shin Kim, eds. New Haven, CT: East Rock Institute for the Centennial Publication Committee of Chicago. NAKASEC coordinated a national two-week fast for the passage of the DREAM Act in 2004 with the participation of 700 individuals, and held a summer community fundraising campaign, gaining the monetary contribution of 14,000 individuals, to post a full-page ad in the New York Times and Washington Post urging the American public to support comprehensive immigration reform based on the principles of legalization of undocumented immigrants, an end to measures that prevented many families to be together, and the defense of workers' rights and civil rights & liberties.  Korean American Resource & Cultural Center  The Korean American Resource & Cultural Center (KRCC for short, and ÌïúÏù∏ÍµêÏú°Î¨∏Ìôî ÎßàÎãπÏßë or ÎßàÎãπÏßë in Korean) was founded in March 1995. KRCC has a strong youth program and leadership has worked broadly in a multi-racial and multi-ethnic environment. KRCC is member of a number of local coalitions, including the Coalition of Asian, African, Arab, European and Latino Immigrants of Illinois and the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights.  Korean Resource Center  The Korean Resource Center (KRC for short, and ÎØºÏ°±ÌïôÍµê in Korean) is a non-profit multi-issue, multi- mode grassroots organization based in Koreatown, Los Angeles that works with the Korean American, immigrant and low-income people of color communities of Los Angeles. It was one of the major players in the Korean American community during the restoration movement after the welfare reform of 1996 through the \\"Fix '96 Campaign\\" and more recently in issues of access to health services and immigration reform. During the late 1990s and early 2000s KRC diversified its rights advocacy component into specialized programs that addressed health, immigrant rights and voting rights. KRC was part of the March 25th Marches with a million protestors in downtown Los Angeles as well as other protests. NAKASEC joined other labor, faith, and rights organizations in Southern California to form the We Are America Coalition, which mobilized hundreds of thousands of immigrants and allies in the May Day March. KRC has traditionally been supported by the Korean American community in its entirety and relied on small size individual donations, sales of used cans and garage sales to sustain its programs. A recent trend has been to rely more on foundation grants, but its tradition of community support is alive in its campaign fundraisers as well as its continuance of can and garage sales. = Community Groups = KRC has a very strong and large senior age base because of its work with welfare rights and social services. KRC's anniversary booklet claims that KRC served over 5,000 Korean Americans free of charge during 2006, mostly through education and enrollment of Medicare Part D as well as Medi-Cal, low- income legal and tax services, naturalization, etc. Many seniors are active in all of KRC's components. KRC runs its own poongmul troupe, called HanNuRi (traditional Korean peasant percussion music), and educates the community through its poongmul classes. KRC's poongmul troupe has become renowned in the activist community through its performance in rallies and cultural events.

Career =Newsprint= Brant went to work at Brant-Allen Industries, a paper conversion company co-founded by his father, Murray Brant. In the early 1970s, Brant and a cousin, Joseph Allen ‚Äî the son of Murray Brant's business partner ‚Äî led the company into the manufacturing side of the business and expanded the company into paper mill (converting pulp into paper) ownership purchasing a mill in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec and partnering with the Washington Post and Dow Jones to purchase a mill in Ashland, Virginia. In the early 2000s, as paper demand continued to decline, Brant embarked on a buying spree purchasing a second Quebec mill in 2004 for $205 million (from Enron) and a third Quebec mill in 2006 for $135 million. In 2008, he bought out his partner and changed the name of the company to White Birch Paper Company. Also in 2008, he purchased SP Newsprint Co for $305 million, a newsprint manufacturer with operations in Oregon and Georgia. The purchase gave Brant control of 22% of the North American newsprint market, second to AbitibiBowater with 43%. Brant expanded SP Newsprint into paper recycling operating 23 recycling facilities through its SP Recycling unit. In a court filing around 2007, Brandt said the ailing newsprint market and the recession had slashed his net worth to less than $500 million from $1.4 billion that year. In February 2010, White Birch Paper restructured under Chapter 11 proceedings, due to excessive debt and declining demand for newsprint. The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2012 and closed its main pulp and paper mill in Quebec City, sending home more than 600 workers.

Walter Milne (died April 1558), also recorded as Mill or Myln, was the last Protestant martyr to be burned in Scotland before the Scottish Reformation changed the country from Catholic to Presbyterian. Early life In his early years he visited Germany, where he imbibed the doctrines of the Reformation. At one point he was Roman Catholic priest of the Parish of Lunan near Montrose. During the time of Cardinal Beaton information was laid against him as a heretic, whereupon he fled the country, and was condemned to be burnt wherever he might be found. Arrest and trial Long after the cardinal's death he was at the instance of John Hamilton, archbishop of St. Andrews, apprehended on 20 April 1558 in the town of Dysart, Fife. He ‚Äòwas warmand him in ane poor wyfes hous, and was teaching her the commandments of God‚Äô. After being for some time confined in the castle of St. Andrews, he was brought for trial before an assemblage of bishops, abbots, and doctors in the cathedral church. He was then over eighty years of age, and so weak and infirm that he could scarce climb up to the pulpit where he had to answer before them. Yet, says Foxe, ‚Äòwhen he began to speak he made the church to ring and sound again with so great courage and stoutness that the Christians which were present were no less rejoiced than the adversaries were confounded and ashamed.‚Äô So far from pretending to deny the accusations against him, he made use of the opportunity boldly to denounce what he regarded as the special errors of the Romish church; his trial was soon over, and he was condemned to be burnt as a heretic on 28 April 1558. When he was sentenced to death, Milne replied \\"I will not recant the truth. I am corn, not chaff; I will not be blown away with the wind or burst by the flail. I will survive both.\\" Execution He was burned at the stake for heresy outside Deans Court, St Andrews, in April 1558 at the age of 82. According to George Buchanan, the commonalty of St. Andrews were so offended at the sentence that they shut up their shops in order that they might sell no materials for his execution; and after his death they heaped up in his memory a great pile of stones on the place where he was burned. Subsequent events Mylne was married, and his widow was alive in 1573, when she received 6l. 13s. 4d. out of the thirds of the benefices. After John Knox preached in June 1559 in St. Andrews his famous sermon on \\"cleansing of the temple\\" that began the Scottish reformation, \\"by order of the magistrates the churches were stripped of the monuments of 'idolatry' which were ceremoniously burned on the spot where Myln had suffered.\\" Milne is commemorated on the Martyrs' Monument at St Andrews.

The original core of the band consisted of Jan-Henrik Ohme (vocals), Jon-Arne Vilbo (guitars), and Thomas Andersen (keyboards, programming, production). They started making music together in 1996 and the band has since expanded with Mikael Kr√∏mer (violin, co-producer), Robert R Johansen (drums), and Kristian Torp (bass). Gazpacho's music has been described by one critic as being \\"classical post-ambient nocturnal atmospheric neo-progressive folk world rock\\". Their music has been compared to A-ha, Radiohead, Marillion, and Porcupine Tree. History =Early years (1996‚Äì2001)= Childhood friends Jon-Arne Vilbo and Thomas Andersen had played together in a band called Delerium before, which in their own words \\"whittled away\\". After several years of separation, the two friends met again and started making music together again. Andersen had met Jan-Henrik Ohme through his work as radio commercial producer and brought him into the jam sessions, which laid the foundation for Gazpacho as it exists today. The band name comes from an attempt to describe their music. > Andersen: \\"We are a very unlikely mixture of people really, not the average > types you'd expect to see in the same band‚Ä¶ so we thought Gazpacho, which > really is the bastard of soups (meshed up vegetables served cold), was the > perfect name for our group(...)With Gazpacho you get a surprise, something > unexpected, something out of the norm, a 'positive' contradiction. We feel > this describes our band very well.\\". Roy Funner played bass on the finished recordings of the band, though he wasn't part of the writing process. For the drum tracks, a computer was used. For two years, the band worked on a concept album, Random Access Memory; a piece of work which they discarded altogether when they felt they had not yet reached the level of musical maturity for such an ambitious project. =Make- A-Star and Bravo (2002‚Äì2003)= All three members of Gazpacho were involved with the Scandinavian branch of Marillion's The Web fanclub. This led to Ohme being invited to sing the Marillion track Afraid of Sunlight at the Swap The Band show of the first Marillion Convention Weekend. At this convention, the band handed out free four-track promos called Get It While It's Cold to anyone interested. These promos also found their way to several internet magazines, which gave the band almost unanimous acclaim, with one reviewer calling the music \\"expertly-crafted and truly inventive\\". In May 2002, Gazpacho entered a song contest on Make-A-Star with the song \\"Sea of Tranquility\\", and won. Their second entry, \\"Ghost\\", made it to second position, and this was enough to gain them the opportunity to release an album through MP3.com. Get It While It's Cold (37¬∞C) contained three tracks of the promo EP and three new tracks. One of these new songs, \\"Nemo\\", saw the band winning the Make-A-Star contest for a second time. The release of the EP continued to garner them international acclaim. In 2003, Gazpacho released their first studio album, Bravo, which contained five of the six tracks off the MP3.com album, and six new compositions. Utilizing the possibilities of the internet, the band had teamed up with the American singer-songwriter and fellow Make-A-Star contestee Esther Valentine and New Zealand producer Peter Kearns. Valentine sang a duet with Ohme on the song \\"Novgorod\\" (which she also co-wrote) and Kearns produced two of the tracks off Bravo. Bravo gained the band more international acclaim, with Dutch leading music magazine Oor stating \\"their debut album is a rare beauty\\". Gazpacho was invited to perform at the second Marillion Convention Weekend. For their live band, the lineup was further expanded with drummer Geir Digernes (who had also played drums on some of the tracks on Bravo) and for the performance of the title track they were joined by Mikael Kr√∏mer (violin) and Kristian Skedsmo (flute). =Supporting Marillion (2004‚Äì2005)= The performance at the Convention Weekend led to a support slot on Marillion's 31-date European Marbles tour around 11 countries, further raising Gazpacho's profile. For this tour, Robert Johansen joined the band as the new drummer, and Mikael Kr√∏mer and Kristian Skedsmo also joined the live line-up. Prior to the tour, the band released their second full-length album, When Earth Lets Go, giving them enough material for their live repertoire. On When Earth Lets Go the band collaborated with producer Steve Lyon (Paul McCartney, Depeche Mode, The Cure) who had agreed to produce the track \\"Substitute for Murder\\" to see if he could potentially interest any labels. Despite Lyon's involvement, the increased awareness after playing with Marillion, and more rave reviews on their album, Gazpacho was not able to secure a record deal. Eventually, Marillion offered Gazpacho the chance to release their next album on the band's own Racket Records label. Racket released the band's third album Firebird and re-released Bravo and When Earth Lets Go. The support of Marillion also led to the collaboration with guitarist Steve Rothery, who plays a solo on the track \\"Do You Know What You Are Saying\\". Other guest appearances on the album came in the form of fans who had been encouraged to send in sound samples, which the band would use. Among the unusual instruments featured on the record are maracas, a comb, and a Leopard II battle tank. Roy Funner had left the band after the 2004 tour to focus more on his family, and he was replaced by Kristian Torp. With the new lineup, Gazpacho supported Marillion once more on four gigs during the Not Quite Christmas Tour. After this tour, Kristian Skedsmo announced he no longer wanted to go on prolonged tours away from home, and the live lineup was reduced to a six-piece band. =Night (2006‚Äì2008)= After a year of silence, Night was released in February 2007. For this occasion, Gazpacho was once more invited to appear at Marillion's Convention Weekend, this time in The Netherlands. They also played their first international headlining gig at the Boerderij in Zoetermeer, Netherlands, on 1 February 2007. Night showed a departure from the short song format of the previous albums, but instead consisted of one long 50-minute conceptual piece, divided into five parts. In the words of the band, it was a > musical description of a dream or a stream of consciousness. It explores the > question of where dreams end and reality begins and the mind as the tool > that has to decide what to believe. The character goes through various > memories real and imagined and sees the world from the angles of different > people. He travels through time and visits places across the world including > old New Orleans and Ancient woods with Pagan rituals being performed. Night > is about life and the various ways of interpreting existence. Pretentious? > Oh yes but delicious as well... very delicious. Mikael Kr√∏mer, who had played violin on all previous albums and live shows, was welcomed as a full-time band member on Night, also earning a co-producer credit. Night also saw the return of Kristian \\"The Duke\\" Skedsmo, playing six instruments on the album. Skedsmo rejoined the band for a one-off live appearance in Oslo on 19 January 2008. The album was almost instantly well received in progressive rock circles, topping the Just For Kicks Music sales chart for two weeks after its release. The (prog-related) international press was almost unanimously positive, calling the album \\"very, very grand art\\", \\"nothing short of a masterpiece\\", and \\"an incredible album\\". Night charted in the reader's top 20 at Progwereld for more than a year. The album also did well in several readers' polls at the end of 2007. It was voted 9th best album of 2007 by listeners of Polish radio station MLWZ and 8th best album in the Dutch Progressive Rock Page Poll. During one of the live performances of Night on 18 July 2008, the audience at the Boerderij in Zoetermeer got a first taste of a new song in progress called \\"Tick Tock\\", which was played for the first time in its entirety, clocking in at 22 minutes and 24 seconds. This song later turned out to be the title track of Gazpacho's new album. =Tick Tock (2009‚Äì2010)= On 15 March 2009, Gazpacho's fifth studio album, Tick Tock, was released on HTW Records, a division of Sony BMG. The album is based on the story of French writer and navigator Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, who took off in an attempt at a long-distance flight from Paris to Saigon in 1935. He crashed in the Sahara Desert many hours later, becoming stranded with his co- pilot Prevot. Later, he recounted his experience in a book called Wind, Sand and Stars, and this story forms the basis of the album Tick Tock. In connection with Tick Tock, Gazpacho conducted their first official headlining tour, the Tick Tock Tour, visiting six countries between 26 March and 8 April 2009. In the meantime, the album and corresponding shows received rave reviews. On 10 July 2009, Gazpacho headed off to Germany to perform as headliners at the Night of the Prog festival in Loreley, Germany. The concert was recorded and released on DVD in January 2010 as A Night at Loreley. At the end of 2009, during the process of editing, mixing, and producing the DVD, the band announced that drummer Robert R. Johansen had decided to leave the band due to personal circumstances. In the early days of 2010, a replacement for Johansen was found in Lars Erik Asp, just in time for the second part of the Tick Tock Tour. The original plan was to visit six countries in March/April, but due to a plane crash in Poland, with the corresponding one week of mourning, the Polish promoter decided to cancel the concerts in Poland from 16‚Äì18 April. The dates were postponed until September 2010. On 1 May 2010, the band's first concert in the United States was announced as part of a progressive rock festival. Gazpacho played at the Majestic Theater in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. For the European gigs in September, they hired Micheal Krumins (Green Carnation, Sirenia) as a stand-in guitarist as Vilbo had to take time off due to family commitments. =Missa Atropos (2011)= In 2010, during the Tick Tock Tour, Gazpacho sold copies of their new album, Missa Atropos. Even before its official release on 26 November, it had achieved number 1 on Progwereld, a Dutch prog site. Missa Atropos was a concept album taking the idea of Atropos, a Greek Goddess, and updating it to the modern era, where a man isolates himself from the world in a lighthouse to write a mass for Atropos, experiencing solitude as he does so. The story tells of what happens inside his head, his three attempts to write a mass, and his ultimate success at creation. The new album was accompanied by a 12-gig tour] in five countries in January and February 2011. One of those countries was the UK, where the London gig at Dingwalls on 30 January was recorded and released on 24 October as the double live CD called London. =March of Ghosts (2012‚Äì2013)= The end of 2011 brought the news that March of Ghosts would be the name of the band's seventh studio album and the follow-up to Missa Atropos. While Missa Atropos was a long story about one person leaving everything behind, March of Ghosts was a collection of short stories. The idea behind the album was to have the lead character spend a night where a number of ghosts (dead and alive) would march past him to tell their stories. Characters include Haitian war criminals, the crew of the Mary Celeste, a returning American World War I soldier who finds himself in 2012, and the ghost of an English comedy writer (P. G. Wodehouse) who was wrongly accused of treason. The album was released on 12 March 2012Kscope  Gazpacho ‚Äì March Of Ghosts ‚Äì new album to be released on Kscope in March 2012 . Kscopemusic.com.

Facebook.com. Retrieved on 26 October 2015. Demon was released in March 2014 and the band toured the UK and Europe in support of it in April. =Night of the Demon and Molok (2015)= Gazpacho released a live CD/DVD album titled Night of the Demon in April 2015. In October/November 2015, they toured in support of the album Molok (Kscope; 23 October 2015). They played two venues in Poland, two in Germany, and two in the Netherlands, including The Boerderij, Zoetermeer. They completed the tour with a gig at the O2 in Islington, London. The band were joined on the tour by chamber progressive band Iamthemorning. =Soyuz (2018)= Gazpacho announced in October 2017 that drummer Lars Erik Asp had left the band to focus on other commitments. They publicized that they would be releasing their tenth studio album, Soyuz, in 2018, and would embark on a European tour in support of the album, before appearing at the Be Prog! My Friend festival in Barcelona in June. Former drummer Robert Johansen was named as Asp's replacement for the Soyuz album, which, according to keyboardist Thomas Andersen, \\"is about being frozen in time\\". Soyuz came out on 18 May 2018, with opening track \\"Soyuz One\\" released as the first single on 23 February 2018. =Fireworker (2020)= In April 2020, Gazpacho announced the title of their upcoming eleventh studio album Fireworker, on their Facebook page. The band plans to tour in October 2020 with Pure Reason Revolution.

His playing career was played out during the 1920s and 1930s. He is most noted for his time with Italian sides Juventus and Napoli, for the latter of which he holds the record for the most goals scored in Serie A for the club; he is also Napoli's second all-time highest scorer in the Italian leagues. His younger brother Oliviero Vojak played professionally as well, for Juventus and Napoli. To distinguish them, Antonio was known as Vojak I and Oliviero as Vojak II. Career Vojak was born in Pula, now in Croatia but then part of Austria-Hungary, and later ceded to the Kingdom of Italy in 1918. Vojak's football career started with Lazio during the 1924‚Äì25 season, his stay there was very short; playing only 10 games but scoring 7 goals. This caught the attention of Juventus, who signed up Vojak within that year. During his three-year stay with the Turinese team, Vojak was part of a squad which won the Italian Football Championship in 1926, amassing 46 goals in 102 games for the club in total, as well as 2 European Cup appearances in 1929 against Slavia Prague.Forza-Juventus.com He moved on next to Napoli, playing in a squad that featured Attila Sallustro. He stayed with the club until 1935, scoring over 100 goals for them. Vojak also appeared for the Italian national football team once in 1932 where he played midfield. Due to fascist anti-slav laws, he was forced to use the name Vogliani. After leaving Napoli, Vojak played only two more seasons; first with Genoa and then with Lucchese-Libertas in 1936‚Äì37 where he played only 1 game. After retiring, he served as a manager.

His work at St Pancras includes the construction of a new 13 platform extension deck in a modern manner; reconstruction of the west side of the station (made necessary by the construction of the new Thameslink station box below) in a historically based Neo-gothic manner in the style of Sir George Gilbert Scott; as well as the refurbishment of the original station building by Scott and William Barlow. Lansley was also Lead Architect for Stratford and Ebbsfleet International Stations, which were designed by project architect Mark Fisher. These stations extends the language of Mies van der Rohe in a contemporary context, and form a close stylistic bond with the new station extension at St Pancras. A series of BBC television programmes, The Eight Hundred Million Pound Railway Station, were broadcast as six 30-minute episodes between 13‚Äí28 November 2007. In this series the project that was to become St. Pancras International station was shown during the different phases of construction.

He is perhaps best known for his close friendships with Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Windham moved with his then-boyfriend Fred Melton, an artist, to New York City in 1939. In 1942 Windham collaborated with Williams on the play, You Touched Me!, which is based on a D. H. Lawrence short story with the same title. Windham received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1960. Windham became estranged from Williams after Williams published his book Memoirs (1975).Williams, Tennessee. Memoirs. New Directions Publishing (1975) Windham later published a volume of their correspondence, which Williams claimed was done without his permission. Windham remained a friend of Capote until Capote's death. Windham also met and befriended such diverse figures as Lincoln Kirstein, Pavel Tchelitchew and Paul Cadmus. In 1943, Windham met Sandy Campbell, an undergraduate student at Princeton University. In 1943 they began a relationship that would last until Campbell's death in 1988. Campbell frequently helped Windham publish books through the Stamperia Valdonega in Verona, Italy. Partially because Windham was influenced by his own life, homosexuality is one of many themes treated in his work. Windham's novels include The Dog Star (1950),Windham, Donald. The dog star.

Becoming a jet operator When the world's major scheduled airlines began re-equipping their fleets with new generation widebodied jet aircraft from the early 1970s, a growing number of older generation, narrow-bodied jet planes, such as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, became available on the second-hand market at prices smaller airlines that were lacking the resources to invest in new equipment could afford. IAS Cargo Airlines became one of these smaller airlines that took advantage of this situation by purchasing its first DC-8-50F jet freighter in 1974. Jet operations commenced the following year.Air Transport, Flight International, 7 August 1975, p. 174 As business continued to expand, it introduced further DC-8-50Fs into its fleet during the second half of the 1970s. By the end of the 1970s the company's fleet mainly consisted of DC-8-50Fs. By that time it was receiving a growing number of air freight consignments that were shipped to its Gatwick base from the \\"other side\\" of the Channel. In October 1978 the firm introduced its first larger capacity, \\"stretched\\" DC-8 \\"Super Sixty\\" series freighter, a -62CF wet-leased from Finnair.Airliner market, Air Transport, Flight International, 28 October 1978, p. 1546 Merging with a rival Stansted-based Trans Meridian Air Cargo (TMAC), another small independent UK all-cargo operator wholly owned by Trafalgar House subsidiary Cunard Steamship Co,Cargo airlines to merge, Air Transport, Flight International, 4 August 1979, p. 309 had come into being in 1962.World airline directory, Flight International, 28 April 1979, p. 1409 TMAC also operated a similar aircraft fleet consisting of the same aircraft types, including a pair of DC-8Fs.Air Transport, Flight International, 23 July 1977, p. 255Green light for British Cargo, Air Transport, Flight International, 1 September 1979, p. 636 Therefore, combining both companies' businesses to achieve greater operational synergies as well as to attain greater economies of scale seemed to be the next \\"logical\\" step to ensure survival in a competitive market place dominated by bigger, more powerful rivals.

It folded in March 1980.Aircraft (Gone but not forgotten ... HEAVYLIFT CARGO AIRLINES: Enter the Belfast), p. 50, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, May 2011 =Causes of collapse= The main reasons for the combined entity's collapse included: * A deep recession in Britain, which affected UK- based manufacturing companies that were the airline's main customers. This caused a slump in those companies' output of manufactured goods and led to a collapse in demand for specialist air freight services. * Steeply rising jet fuel prices in the aftermath of the fall of the Shah of Iran. This increased the operating costs of relatively fuel-thirsty narrow-bodied jet freighters such as the Boeing 707 and the DC-8 (compared with more fuel-efficient widebodied freighters). * A big influx of long-haul widebodied aircraft capacity into the fleets of British Airways and British Caledonian, Britain's two principal scheduled airlines at the time, as well as their main overseas competitors' fleets during the late 1970s/early 1980s. This resulted in a major increase in bellyhold cargo capacity that cost freight forwarders and shippers less to fill (compared with the higher rates that were required to fill narrow-bodied pure freighters profitably). Incidents and accidents In 1977 IAS Cargo Airlines became indirectly involved in a fatal accident causing the loss of an aircraft bearing its name as part of a hybrid colour scheme. This hybrid colour scheme combined parts of IAS Cargo Airlines' livery with that of Dan-Air Services Ltd, one of the leading wholly privately owned, independent British airlines at the time that was the owner and operator of the crashed aircraft.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 89, 90 The accident itself involved one of Dan-Air's Boeing 707-321C freighters (registration G-BEBP), which IAS Cargo Airlines had operated under a so-called \\"wet lease\\" arrangement with Dan-Air, whereby the latter was providing the aircraft as well as flight deck crews and maintenance support under contract to the former. The aforesaid aircraft crashed on 14 May 1977 during the final approach to Lusaka Airport at the end of a non-scheduled all-cargo flight from London Heathrow via Athens and Nairobi when its right- hand horizontal stabiliser separated as a result of metal fatigue, causing a loss of pitch control and killing all six occupants.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 89Inspection shortcomings contributed to Lusaka 707 fatigue accident, Air Transport, Flight International, 23 June 1979, p. 2247 Some air accident databases wrongly cite IAS Cargo Airlines as the operator of the aircraft involved in this accident despite Dan-Air being that aircraft's actual operator.

It is included there as the twelfth book of the Sutta Pitaka's Khuddaka Nikaya. Tradition ascribes it to the Buddha's disciple Sariputta. It comprises 30 chapters on different topics, of which the first, on knowledge, makes up about a third of the book. History Tradition ascribes the Patisambhidamagga to the Buddha's great disciple, Sariputta.This ascription can be found in the Pali commentary to the Patisambhidamagga (Pais-a I 1,18) (Hin√ºber, 2000, p. 60). It bears some similarities to the Dasuttarasutta Sutta of the Digha Nikaya, which is also attributed to Sariputta. According to German tradition of Indology this text was likely composed around the 2nd century CE.Hin√ºber (2000), p. 60. Indications of the relative lateness of the text include numerous quotations from the Sutta and Vinaya Pitaka, as well as an assumed familiarity with a variety of Buddhist legends and stories- for example, the names of various arahants are given without any discussion of their identities. The term patisambhida does not occur in the older sutra and vinaya texts, but does appear in both the Abhidhamma and several other Khuddaka Nikaya texts regarded as relatively late. A variant form, pratisamvid, occurs in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and suggests that the concept itself was shared with other, non-Theravada sects. The Patisambhidamagga is also included in the Dipavamsa in a list of texts rejected by the Mahasanghikas. On the basis of this reference and certain thematic elements, AK Warder suggested that some form of the text may date to the 3rd Century BCE, the traditional date ascribed to the schism with the Mahasanghikas. L. S. Cousins associated it with the doctrinal divisions of the Second Buddhist Council and dated it to the first century BCE. The Patisambhidamagga has been described as an \\"attempt to systematize the Abhidhamma\\" and thus as a possible precursor to the Visuddhimagga. The text's systematic approach and the presence of a matika summarizing the contents of the first section are both features suggestive of the Abhidhamma, but it also includes some features of the Sutta Pitaka, including repeated invocation of the standard sutta opening eva·πÉ me sutta·πÉ ('thus have I heard'). Its content and aspects of its composition overlap significantly with the Vibhanga, and A.K. Warder suggested that at some stage in its development it may have been classified as an Abhidhamma text. Noa Ronkin suggests that the Patisambhidamagga likely dates from the era of the Abhidhamma's formation, and represents a parallel development of the interpretive traditions reflected by the Vibhanga and Dhammasangani. Emptiness The Patisambhidamagga is probably the first Pali Abhidhamma text which uses the term \\"sabhava\\" in the section titled the Su√±√±akatha. It defines sabhava as the empty (su√±√±am) nature of the five aggregates: > \\"Born materiality is empty of sabhava (sabhavena su√±√±am); disappeared > materiality is both changed and empty. Born feeling is empty of sabhava; > disappeared feeling is both changed and empty...Born > conceptualization...Born volitions...Born consciousness...Born becoming is > empty of sabhava; disappeared becoming is both changed and empty. This is > ‚Äòempty in terms of change‚Äô.\\" The text also defines the sense spheres as \\"void of self or of what belongs to self or of what is permanent or everlasting or eternal or not-subject-to- change.\\"Nanamoli, The Path of Discrimination, 1982, page 359 According to Noa Ronkin: \\"this extract means that the totality of human experience is devoid of an enduring substance or of anything which belongs to such a substance, because this totality is dependent on many and various conditions, and is of the nature of being subject to a continuous process of origination and dissolution.\\" Overview The Patisambhidamagga has three divisions (vagga) composed of ten \\"chapters\\" (kathƒÅ) each for a total of thirty chapters. The three divisions are: * MahƒÅvagga (\\"Great Division\\") - starts with an enumeration (mƒÅtikƒÅ) of 73 types of knowledge (√±ƒÅa) which are then elaborated upon in detail. * Yuganandhavagga (\\"Coupling Division\\") - poses a series of questions. * Pa√±√±ƒÅvagga (\\"Wisdom Division\\") - answers the prior division's questions.

A satire on academic pretension, female education, and pr√©ciosit√© (French for preciousness), it was one of his most popular comedies. It premiered at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal on 11 March 1672. Short synopsis Two young people, Henriette and Clitandre, are in love, but in order to marry, they must overcome an obstacle: the attitude of Henriette's family. Her sensible father and uncle are in favour of the marriage; but unfortunately her father is under the thumb of his wife, Philaminte. And Philaminte, supported by Henriette's aunt and sister, wishes her to marry Trissotin, a \\"scholar\\" and mediocre poet with lofty aspirations, who has these three women completely in his thrall. For these three ladies are \\"learned\\"; their obsession in life is learning and culture of the most pretentious kind, and Trissotin is their special prot√©g√© and the fixture of their literary salon. Detailed synopsis =Act I= In Scene 1, Henriette tells her sister Armande of her intention to marry Clitandre. Armande, after scolding Henriette for rejecting the pursuit of learning for domesticity, says that she believes that Clitandre, once her own suitor, is still in love with her, despite the fact she refused him because of her devotion to scholarship. In Scene 2, Clitandre arrives and makes it clear that Armande is deluding herself; her coldness killed his love for her, and he is now truly in love with Henriette. In Scene 3, the embittered Armande leaves and Henriette advises Clitandre to gain the consent of her mother (Philaminte), for it is she who dominates the family. Clitandre knows he must flatter Philaminte to gain her consent, but finds her \\"studies\\" foolish and cannot hide this. He meets Henriette's aunt Belise in Scene 4 and attempts to speak with her about his wish to marry Henriette, but Belise imagines that this is merely a subtle way of declaring that he loves her (Belise) and ignores what he is actually trying to say. =Act II= Henriette's uncle Ariste addresses Clitandre in Scene 1 and assures him of his support. In Scene 2 Ariste begins to talk with Chrysale, Henriette's father; in Scene 3 he comes to the point and presents Clitandre's request for Chrysale's consent to marry Henriette. But Belise here interrupts, saying that he is wrong and in fact Clitandre loves her; Ariste responds by mocking her and pointing out she is always inventing suitors for herself. Belise leaves; in Scene 4, Chrysale consents to the marriage; when Ariste advises that he talk to his wife about it, Chrysale replies there is nothing to discuss and that he makes the decisions in this household. But the hollowness of this claim is revealed in Scene 5: Martine, the family servant, runs in, announcing she is being sent away by Philaminte. Philaminte and Belise enter in Scene 6 and reveal the motive for their anger at Martine: she has committed a terrible crime - bad grammar, which is worse, they say, than theft. In Scene 7, Chrysale reproaches his wife for neglecting common sense and ordinary household duties in her obsession with her studies and her patronage of Trissotin. But when Chrysale gingerly brings up the topic of Henriette's marriage in Scene 8, Philaminte interrupts before he can tell her the full story, and announces that she thinks it good that Henriette should marry, and that she has found the perfect husband for her: Trissotin. The weak Chrysale does not know how to reply; the ladies leave. When Ariste returns in Scene 9, Chrysale confesses his weakness to him, but resolves that he will no longer be ruled by his wife. =Act III= Scene 1 opens at the ladies' literary salon, where Trissotin is amusing and instructing them. Henriette wanders in during Scene 2, and Philaminte forces her to stay and listen to Trissotin's reading of his own poems. Scene 3 sees the arrival of another scholar, Vadius; the ladies swoon over him when they learn he knows classical Greek, and line up to kiss him, \\"pour l'amour du grec\\" (\\"for the love of Greek\\"). Trissotin and Vadius then pay each other extravagant compliments; however, they then quarrel violently when Vadius criticises an anonymous sonnet which was in fact by Trissotin. Philaminte explains in Scene 4 why she has forced Henriette to stay; she announces her intention that Henriette marry Trissotin. Armande congratulates Henriette in Scene 5, and reminds her of her duty to obey their mother. Then Chrysale arrives and orders that Henriette marry Clitandre. Henriette is delighted; the learned ladies, especially Armande, are not. =Act IV= In Scene 1, Armande is conducting a tirade against Clitandre. Clitandre appears in Scene 2 and asks why she hates him so. She replies that he betrayed her by falling in love with Henriette instead of continuing to love her (Armande) platonically. Philaminte concludes the conversation by repeating her intention that Henriette marry Trissotin. Trissotin appears in Scene 3 and has a verbal stoush with Clitandre concerning the value of scholarship. A letter arrives in Scene 4 from the bitter Vadius which informs Philaminte that Trissotin is only after her money. But she dismisses this and summons a notary to conduct the wedding immediately. Chrysale, informed of this in Scene 5, decides to thwart her plans and goes to look for his own notary. =Act V= Henriette meets Trissotin in private in Scene 1 and begs him not to marry her, but he claims he is deeply in love with her. In Scene 2, Chrysale arrives accompanied by Martine, reaffirms that he is master of the household and demands to be obeyed. Philaminte and the learned ladies then arrive with a notary in Scene 3; when the notary asks who the bridegroom is, Philaminte and Chrysale each nominate a different man, and Martine defends Chrysale's choice. Ariste runs in Scene 4 with a shocking announcement; a decision has just been handed down in a long-running lawsuit that means the family is now ruined financially. Upon learning this, Trissotin tries to get out of the marriage, then confesses he was only interested in Henriette for her money, to Philaminte's fury. Ariste reveals that his story was untrue, a ruse to reveal Trissotin's true colours, and the play ends with the marriage of Clitandre and Henriette.

View of the square facing north  Setting  North of the square and behind the statue is the street Slussplan; the bridges and ramps of the southbound street Katarinav√§gen and the northbound quay Skeppsbron delimits the square to the west and to the east respectively; while the canal Karl Johanslussen forms the southern edge of the square. Under the bridge in the south-eastern corner of the square is the rock club Debaser, boasting some 1,500 artists since its opening in 2002. In summer, the lock and the occasionally dramatic passage of numerous pleasure boats and the accompanying families makes the square a popular spot to tourists and Stockholmers alike, while the club and its open-air restaurant, makes the space a natural hangout for a slightly younger audience. On the opposite side of the canal is an elevated space called Slussterrasen.  The statue  The square is named after the presence of the equestrian statue of King Charles XIV John (1763‚Äì1844) today placed just north of the square but originally located south of the canal, and inaugurated on 4 November 1854, the 40th anniversary of the union between Sweden and Norway and four years after the inauguration of the lock of Nils Ericson. Designed by Bengt Erland Fogelberg (1786‚àí1854), at the time located in Italy, the sculpture was cut in Rome and cast in Munich in 1852, while the tall base was cut in Carrara to the design of the artist. The original intentions of the sculptor was to have the statue facing east, the king's command baton pointing out the obvious enemy on the opposite side of the Baltic. When inaugurated, however, the statue was instead turned north towards the city, thus symbolizing the French general and the Bernadotte Dynasty which came with him, arriving to Stockholm to occupy the Swedish throne. When the Slussen area was adapted to accommodate modern traffic loads in 1935, the statue was turned south, pointing straight at the new and much discussed roundabout. While the reason for this U-turn remains unelucidated, save for the fact the statue would otherwise be standing face to face with the fa√ßades north of the square, Sweden remains a monarchy and the Bernadotte Dynasty is still occupying the Royal Palace in the old town.  The lock  The present lock was inaugurated in 1935 and the fourth to be built, preceded by a first horse-driven lock, called Drottining Kristinas Sluss (\\"Lock of Queen Christina\\"), constructed by two Dutch engineers and inaugurated in 1642; a second, Polhems (\\"Lock of Polhem\\"), designed by and named after Christopher Polhem (1662‚Äì1751), and inaugurated in 1755; and a third, (Nils Ericsons ) inaugurated in 1850 and designed by Nils Ericson (1802‚Äì1870) and located and still present under the statue.

Development can be defined in a manner applicable to all societies at all historical periods as an upward ascending movement featuring greater levels of energy, efficiency, quality, productivity, complexity, comprehension, creativity, mastery, enjoyment and accomplishment.Jacobs, Garry and Asokan N., \\"Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Social Development\\". In: Human Choice, World Academy of Art & Science, USA, 1999, p. 152. Development is a process of social change, not merely a set of policies and programs instituted for some specific results. During the last five centuries this process has picked up in speed and intensity, and during the last five decades has witnessed a marked surge in acceleration.International Commission on Peace and Food, Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development, Zed Books, UK, 1994, p. 163. The basic mechanism driving social change is increasing awareness leading to better organization. When society senses new and better opportunities for progress it develops new forms of organization to exploit these new openings successfully. The new forms of organization are better able to harness the available social energies and skills and resources to use the opportunities to get the intended results. Development is governed by many factors that influence the results of developmental efforts. There must be a motive that drives the social change and essential preconditions for that change to occur. The motive must be powerful enough to overcome obstructions that impede that change from occurring. Development also requires resources such as capital, technology, and supporting infrastructure. Development is the result of society's capacity to organize resources to meet challenges and opportunities. Society passes through well-defined stages in the course of its development. They are nomadic hunting and gathering, rural agrarian, urban, commercial, industrial, and post-industrial societies. Pioneers introduce new ideas, practices, and habits that conservative elements initially resist. At a later stage, innovations are accepted, imitated, organized, and used by other members of the community. Organizational improvements introduced to support the innovations can take place simultaneously at four different levels--physical, social, mental, and psychological. Moreover four different types of resources are involved in promoting development. Of these four, physical resources are most visible, but least capable of expansion. Productivity of resources increases enormously as the quality of organization and level of knowledge inputs rise. Development pace and scope varies according to the stage society is in. The three main stages are physical, vital (vital refers to the dynamic and nervous social energies of humanity that propel individuals to accomplish), and mental. Terminology Though the term development usually refers to economic progress, it can apply to political, social, and technological progress as well. These various sectors of society are so intertwined that it is difficult to neatly separate them. Development in all these sectors is governed by the same principles and laws, and therefore the term applies uniformly. Economic development and human development need not mean the same thing. Strategies and policies aimed at greater growth may produce greater income in a country without improving the average living standard. This happened in oil-producing Middle Eastern countries‚Äîa surge in oil prices boosted their national income without much benefit to poorer citizens. Conversely, people-oriented programs and policies can improve health, education, living standards, and other quality-of-life measures with no special emphasis on monetary growth. This occurred in the 30 years of socialist and communist rule in Kerala in India.Victor Fic (1970), \\"Kerala: Yenan of India The Rise of Communist Power 1937 -1969\\" (Nachiketa Publishing Bombay) Four related but distinct terms and phenomena form successive steps in a graded series: survival, growth, development, and evolution. Survival refers to a subsistence lifestyle with no marked qualitative changes in living standards. Growth refers to horizontal expansion in the existing plane characterized by quantitative expansion‚Äîsuch as a farmer increasing the area under cultivation, or a retailer opening more stores. Development refers to a vertical shift in the level of operations that causes qualitative changes, such as a retailer turning into a manufacturer or an elementary school turning into a high school. Human development Development is a human process, in the sense that human beings, not material factors, drive development. The energy and aspiration of people who seek development form the motive force that drives development. People's awareness may decide the direction of development. Their efficiency, productivity, creativity, and organizational capacities determine the level of people‚Äôs accomplishment and enjoyment. Development is the outer realization of latent inner potentials. The level of people's education, intensity of their aspiration and energies, quality of their attitudes and values, skills and information all affect the extent and pace of development. These factors come into play whether it is the development of the individual, family, community, nation, or the whole world.Jacobs, Garry and Asokan, N., \\"Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Social Development\\". In: Human Choice, World Academy of Art & Science, USA, 1999, p. 51. Process of emergence of new activities in society =Unconscious vs. conscious development= Human development normally proceeds from experience to comprehension. As society develops over centuries, it accumulates the experience of countless pioneers. The essence of that experience becomes the formula for accomplishment and success. The fact that experience precedes knowledge can be taken to mean that development is an unconscious process that gets carried out first, while knowledge becomes conscious later on only. Unconscious refers to activities that people carry out without knowing what the end results will be, or where their actions will lead. They carry out the acts without knowing the conditions required for success.Jacobs, Garry and Asokan, N., \\"Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Social Development\\". In: Human Choice, World Academy of Art & Science, USA, 1999, p. 57. =Role of pioneering individuals= The gathering conscious knowledge of society matures and breaks out on the surface in the form of new ideas‚Äîespoused by pioneers who also take new initiatives to give expression to those ideas. Those initiatives may call for new strategies and new organizations, which conservative elements may resist. If the pioneer's initiatives succeed, it encourages imitation and slow propagation in the rest of the community. Later, growing success leads to society assimilating the new practice, and it becomes regularized and institutionalized. This can be viewed in three distinct phases of social preparedness, initiative of pioneers, and assimilation by the society. The pioneer as such plays an important role in the development process‚Äîsince through that person, unconscious knowledge becomes conscious. The awakening comes to the lone receptive individual first, and that person spreads the awakening to the rest of the society. Though pioneers appear as lone individuals, they act as conscious representatives of society as a whole, and their role should be viewed in that light.Cleveland, Harlan and Jacobs, Garry, The Genetic Code for Social Development\\". In: Human Choice, World Academy of Art & Science, USA, 1999, p. 7. =Imitation of the pioneer= Though a pioneer comes up with innovative ideas very often the initial response to a pioneer is one of indifference, ridicule or even one of outright hostility. If the pioneer persists and succeeds in an initiative, that person's efforts may eventually get the endorsement of the public. That endorsement tempts others to imitate the pioneer. If they also succeed, news spreads and brings wider acceptance. Conscious efforts to lend organizational support to the new initiative helps institutionalize the new innovation. =Organization of new activities= Organization is the human capacity to harness all available information, knowledge, resources, technology, infrastructure, and human skills to exploit new opportunities‚Äîand the face challenges and hurdles that block progress. Development comes through improvements in the human capacity for organization. In other words, development comes through emergence of better organizations that enhance society's capacity to make use of opportunities and face challenges. The development of organizations may come through formulation of new laws and regulations, or through new systems. Each new step of progress brings a corresponding new organization. Increasing European international trade in the 16th and 17th centuries demanded corresponding development in the banking industry, as well as new commercial laws and civil arbitration facilities. New types of business ventures formed to attract the capital needed to finance expanding trade. As a result, a new business entity appeared‚Äîthe joint-stock company, which limited the investors' liability to the extent of their personal investment without endangering other properties. Each new developmental advance is accompanied by new or more suitable organizations that facilitate that advance. Often, existing inadequate organizations must change to accommodate new advances. Many countries have introduced scores of new reforms and procedures‚Äîsuch as the release of business directories, franchising, lease purchase, service, credit rating, collection agencies, industrial estates, free trade zones, and credit cards. Additionally, a diverse range of Internet services have formed. Each new facility improves effective use of available social energies for productive purposes. The importance of these facilities for speeding development is apparent when they are absent. When Eastern European countries wanted to transition to market- type economies, they were seriously hampered in their efforts due to the absence of supportive systems and facilities.organisation is not only development that we are also have opportunities for doing new activities in the society by knowing new sources we can achieve some what what we have seen in that new innovations & developments =Organization matures into institution= At a particular stage, organizations mature into institutions that become part of society. Beyond this point, an organization does not need laws or agencies to foster growth or ensure a continued presence. The transformation of an organization into an institution signifies society's total acceptance of that new organization. The income tax office is an example of an organization that is actively maintained by the enactment of laws and the formation of an office for procuring taxes. Without active governmental support, this organization would disappear, as it does not enjoy universal public support. On the other hand, the institution of marriage is universally accepted, and would persist even if governments withdrew regulations that demand registration of marriage and impose age restrictions. The institution of marriage is sustained by the weight of tradition, not by government agencies and legal enactments. =Cultural transmission by the family= Families play a major role in the propagation of new activities once they win the support of the society. A family is a miniature version of the larger society‚Äîacceptance by the larger entity is reflected in the smaller entity. The family educates the younger generation and transmits social values like self-restraint, responsibility, skills, and occupational training. Though children do not follow their parents' footsteps as much as they once did, parents still mold their children's attitudes and thoughts regarding careers and future occupations. When families propagate a new activity, it signals that the new activity has become an integral part of the society. Education One of the most powerful means of propagating and sustaining new developments is the educational system in a society. Education transmits society's collective knowledge from one generation to the next. It equips each new generation to face future opportunities and challenges with knowledge gathered from the past. It shows the young generation the opportunities ahead for them, and thereby raises their aspiration to achieve more. Information imparted by education raises the level of expectations of youth, as well as aspirations for higher income. It also equips youth with the mental capacity to devise ways and means to improve productivity and enhance living standards. Society can be conceived as a complex fabric that consists of interrelated activities, systems, and organizations.International Commission on Peace and Food, Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development, Zed Books , UK, 1994, p. 168. Development occurs when this complex fabric improves its own organization. That organizational improvement can take place simultaneously in several dimensions. * Quantitative expansion in the volume of social activities * Qualitative expansion in the content of all those elements that make up the social fabric * Geographic extension of the social fabric to bring more of the population under the cover of that fabric * Integration of existing and new organizations so the social fabric functions more efficiently Such organizational innovations occur all the time, as a continuous process. New organizations emerge whenever a new developmental stage is reached, and old organizations are modified to suit new developmental requirements. The impact of these new organizations may be powerful enough to make people believe they are powerful in their own right‚Äîbut it is society that creates the new organizations required to achieve its objectives. The direction that the developmental process takes is influenced by the population's awareness of opportunities. Increasing awareness leads to greater aspiration, which releases greater energy that helps bring about greater accomplishment. Resources Since the time of the English economist Thomas Malthus, some have thought that capacity for development is limited by availability of natural resources. Resources can be divided into four major categories: physical, social, mental, and human. Land, water, mineral and oil, etc. constitute physical resources. Social resources consist of society's capacity to manage and direct complex systems and activities. Knowledge, information and technology are mental resources. The energy, skill and capacities of people constitute human resources. The science of economics is much concerned with scarcity of resources. Though physical resources are limited, social, mental, and human resources are not subject to inherent limits. Even if these appear limited, there is no fixity about the limitation, and these resources continue to expand over time. That expansion can be accelerated by the use of appropriate strategies. In recent decades the rate of growth of these three resources has accelerated dramatically.International Commission on Peace and Food, Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development, Zed Books, UK, 1994, p. 162 The role of physical resources tends to diminish as society moves to higher developmental levels. Correspondingly, the role of non-material resources increases as development advances. One of the most important non-material resources is information, which has become a key input. Information is a non-material resource that is not exhausted by distribution or sharing. Greater access to information helps increase the pace of its development. Ready access to information about economic factors helps investors transfer capital to sectors and areas where it fetches a higher return. Greater input of non-material resources helps explain the rising productivity of societies in spite of a limited physical resource base. Application of higher non-material inputs also raises the productivity of physical inputs. Modern technology has helped increase the proven sources of oil by 50% in recent years‚Äîand at the same time, reduced the cost of search operations by 75%. Moreover, technology shows it is possible to reduce the amount of physical inputs in a wide range of activities. Scientific agricultural methods demonstrated that soil productivity could be raised through synthetic fertilizers. Dutch farm scientists have demonstrated that a minimal water consumption of 1.4 liters is enough to raise a kilogram of vegetables, compared to the thousand liters that traditional irrigation methods normally require. Henry Ford's assembly line techniques reduced the man-hours of labor required to deliver a car from 783 minutes to 93 minutes. These examples show that the greater input of higher non-material resources can raise the productivity of physical resources and thereby extend their limits.Macfarlane, Robert and Van Harten, Robert. \\"Engines of Development\\". In: Human Choice, World Academy of Art & Science, USA, 1999, p. 47 Technological development When the mind engages in pure creative thinking, it comes up with new thoughts and ideas. When it applies itself to society it can come up with new organizations. When it turns to the study of nature, it discovers nature's laws and mechanisms. When it applies itself to technology, it makes new discoveries and practical inventions that boost productivity. Technical creativity has had an erratic course through history, with some intense periods of creative output followed by some dull and inactive periods. However, the period since 1700 has been marked by an intense burst of technological creativity that is multiplying human capacities exponentially. Though many reasons can be cited for the accelerating pace of technological inventions, a major cause is the role played by mental creativity in an increasing atmosphere of freedom. Political freedom and liberation from religious dogma had a powerful impact on creative thinking during the Age of Enlightenment. Dogmas and superstitions greatly restricted mental creativity. For example, when the astronomer Copernicus proposed a heliocentric view of the world, the church rejected it because it did not conform to established religious doctrine. When Galileo used a telescope to view the planets, the church condemned the device as an instrument of the devil, as it seemed so unusual. The Enlightenment shattered such obscurantist fetters on freedom of thought. From then on, the spirit of experimentation thrived. Though technological inventions have increased the pace of development, the tendency to view developmental accomplishments as mainly powered by technology misses the bigger picture. Technological innovation was spurred by general advances in the social organization of knowledge. In the Middle Ages, efforts at scientific progress were few, mainly because there was no effective system to preserve and disseminate knowledge. Since there was no organized protection for patent rights, scientists and inventors were secretive about observations and discoveries. Establishment of scientific associations and scientific journals spurred the exchange of knowledge and created a written record for posterity. Technological development depends on social organizations. Nobel laureate economist Arthur Lewis observed that the mechanization of factory production in England‚Äîthe Industrial Revolution‚Äîwas a direct result of the reorganization of English agriculture. Enclosure of common lands in England generated surplus income for farmers. That extra income generated additional raw materials for industrial processing, and produced greater demand for industrial products that traditional manufacturing processes could not meet. The opening of sea trade further boosted demand for industrial production for export. Factory production increased many times when production was reorganized to use steam energy, combined with moving assembly lines, specialization, and division of labor. Thus, technological development was both a result of and a contributing factor to the overall development of society. Individual scientific inventions do not spring out of the blue. They build on past accomplishments in an incremental manner, and give a conscious form to the unconscious knowledge that society gathers over time. As pioneers are more conscious than the surrounding community, their inventions normally meet with initial resistance, which recedes over time as their inventions gain wider acceptance. If opposition is stronger than the pioneer, then the introduction of an invention gets delayed. In medieval times, when guilds tightly controlled their members, medical progress was slow mainly because physicians were secretive about their remedies. When Denis Papin demonstrated his steam engine, German naval authorities refused to accept it, fearing it would lead to increased unemployment. John Kay, who developed a flying shuttle textile loom, was physically threatened by English weavers who feared the loss of their jobs. He fled to France where his invention was more favorably received. The widespread use of computers and application of biotechnology raises similar resistance among the public today. Whether the public receives an invention readily or resists depends on their awareness and willingness to entertain rapid change. Regardless of the response, technological inventions occurs as part of overall social development, not as an isolated field of activity. Limits to development The concept of inherent limits to development arose mainly because past development was determined largely by availability of physical resources. Humanity relied more on muscle-power than thought-power to accomplish work. That is no longer the case. Today, mental resources are the primary determinant of development. Where people drove a simple bullock cart, they now design ships and aircraft that carry huge loads across immense distances. Humanity has tamed rivers, cleared jungles and even turned arid desert lands into cultivable lands through irrigation. By using intelligence, society has turned sand into powerful silicon chips that carry huge amounts of information and form the basis of computers. Since there is no inherent limit to the expansion of society's mental resources, the notion of limits to growth cannot be ultimately binding.International Commission on Peace and Food, Uncommon Opportunities: An Agenda for Peace and Equitable Development, Zed Books, UK, 1994, p. 158. Three stages of development Society's developmental journey is marked by three stages: physical, vital, and mental. These are not clear-cut stages, but overlap. All three are present in any society at time. One of them is predominant while the other two play subordinate roles. The term 'vital' denotes the emotional and nervous energies that empower society's drive towards accomplishment and express most directly in the interactions between human beings. Before the full development of mind, it is these vital energies that predominate in human personality and gradually yield the ground as the mental element becomes stronger. The speed and circumstances of social transition from one stage to another varies.Cleveland, Harlan and Jacobs, Garry. \\"Human Choice: The Genetic Code for Social Development\\". In: Futures Research Quarterly, Vol. 31, No. 9‚Äì10, November‚ÄìDecember 1999, Pergamon, UK, p. 964. =Physical stage= The physical stage is characterized by the domination of the physical element of the human personality. During this phase, society is preoccupied with bare survival and subsistence. People follow tradition strictly and there is little innovation and change. Land is the main asset and productive resource during the physical stage and wealth is measured by the size of land holdings. This is the agrarian and feudal phase of society. Inherited wealth and position rule the roost and there is very little upward mobility. Feudal lords and military chiefs function as the leaders of the society. Commerce and money play a relatively minor role. As innovative thinking and experimental approaches are discouraged, people follow tradition unwaveringly and show little inclination to think outside of established guidelines. Occupational skills are passed down from parent to child by a long process of apprenticeship. Guilds restrict the dissemination of trade secrets and technical knowledge. The Church controls the spread of new knowledge and tries to smother new ideas that does not agree with established dogmas. The physical stage comes to an end when the reorganization of agriculture gives scope for commerce and industry to expand. This happened in Europe during the 18th century when political revolutions abolished feudalism and the Industrial Revolution gave a boost to factory production. The shift to the vital and mental stages helps to break the bonds of tradition and inject new dynamism in social life. =Vital stage= The vital stage of society is infused with dynamism and change. The vital activities of society expand markedly. Society becomes curious, innovative and adventurous. During the vital stage emphasis shifts from interactions with the physical environment to social interactions between people. Trade supplants agriculture as the principal source of wealth. The dawning of this phase in Europe led to exploratory voyages across the seas leading to the discovery of new lands and an expansion of sea trade. Equally important, society at this time began to more effectively harness the power of money. Commerce took over from agriculture, and money replaced land as the most productive resource. The center of life shifted from the countryside to the towns where opportunities for trade and business were in greater abundance. The center of power shifted from the aristocracy to the business class, which employed the growing power of money to gain political influence. During the vital stage, the rule of law becomes more formal and binding, providing a secure and safe environment for business to flourish. Banks, shipping companies and joint-stock companies increase in numbers to make use of the opportunities. Fresh innovative thinking leads to new ways of life that people accept as they prove beneficial. Science and experimental approaches begin to make a headway as the hold of tradition and dogma weaken. Demand for education rises. As the vital stage matures through the expansion of the commercial and industrial complex, surplus income arises, which prompts people to spend more on items so far considered out of reach. People begin to aspire for luxury and leisure that was not possible when life was at a subsistence level. =Mental stage= This stage has three essential characteristics: practical, social, and political application of mind. The practical application of mind generates many inventions. The social application of mind leads to new and more effective types of social organization. The political application leads to changes in the political systems that empower the populace to exercise political and human rights in a free and democratic manner. These changes began in the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and gained momentum in the Reformation, which proclaimed the right of individuals to relate directly to God without the mediation of priests. The political application of mind led to the American and French Revolutions, which produced writing that first recognized the rights of the common man and gradually led to the actual enjoyment of these rights. Organization is a mental invention. Therefore it is not surprising that the mental stage of development is responsible for the formulation of a great number of organizational innovations. Huge business corporations have emerged that make more money than even the total earnings of some small countries. Global networks for transportation and communication now connect the nations of the world within a common unified social fabric for sea and air travel, telecommunications, weather reporting and information exchange. In addition to spurring technological and organizational innovation, the mental phase is also marked by the increasing power of ideas to change social life. Ethical ideals have been with humanity since the dawn of civilization. But their practical application in daily social life had to wait for the mental stage of development to emerge. The proclamation of human rights and the recognition of the value of the individual have become effective only after the development of mind and spread of education. The 20th century truly emerged as the century of the common man. Political, social, economic and many other rights were extended to more and more sections of humanity with each succeeding decade. The relative duration of these three stages and the speed of transition from one to another varies from one society to another. However broadly speaking, the essential features of the physical, vital and mental stages of development are strikingly similar and therefore quite recognizable even in societies separated by great distance and having little direct contact with one another. Moreover, societies also learn from those who have gone through these transitions before and, therefore, may be able to make the transitions faster and better. When the Netherlands introduced primary education in 1618, it was a pioneering initiative. When Japan did the same thing late in the 19th century, it had the advantage of the experience of the USA and other countries. When many Asian countries initiated primary education in the 1950s after winning independence, they could draw on the vast experience of more developed nations. This is a major reason for the quickening pace of progress. Natural vs. planned development Natural development is distinct from development by government initiatives and planning. Natural development is the spontaneous and unconscious process of development that normally occurs. Planned development is the result of deliberate conscious initiatives by the government to speed development through special programs and policies. Natural development is an unconscious process, since it results from the behavior of countless individuals acting on their own‚Äîrather than conscious intention of the community. It is also unconscious in the sense that society achieves the results without being fully conscious of how it did so. The natural development of democracy in Europe over the past few centuries can be contrasted with the conscious effort to introduce democratic forms of government in former colonial nations after World War II. Planned development is also largely unconscious: the goals may be conscious, but the most effective means for achieving them may remain poorly understood. Planned development can become fully conscious only when the process of development itself is fully understood. While in planned development the government is the initiator in the natural version it is private individuals or groups that are responsible for the initiative. Whoever initiates, the principles and policies are the same and success is assured only when the conditions and right principles are followed.

In the first series, Sid is portrayed as a nice guy stereotype, an unlucky virgin who is nervous around girls, and has low self- esteem. Tony Stonem (his best friend) is his role model, whom he frequently looks up to. However, by the second series, Sid is more dependable and following Tony's accident, becomes more confident in his own skin, leading him to have sexual relationships with both Cassie Ainsworth and Michelle Richardson, as well as standing up for himself more often. Characterisation Sid is initially portrayed as a virgin who has a crush on his best friend Tony Stonem's girlfriend, Michelle Richardson, although he later realises that his true feelings are for Cassie Ainsworth. Manipulated by Tony, he is frequently unlucky: losing an expensive amount of cannabis, getting beaten up by Jal Fazer's brothers, and getting urinated on by a dog and a homeless person. He is also at first oblivious to the machinations of his best friend who, aware of Sid's undying adoration of Michelle, exploits it for his amusement. Despite this, he seems, at least in earlier episodes, to idolise Tony, replying to the question 'Is that all you do Sid, hang around with Tony?' with 'pretty much'. Sid is generally portrayed as a character with good intentions, juxtaposed with Tony's self-serving egotism. He is extremely loyal towards his friends, including Tony and Anwar Kharral, who frequently abuse his loyalty and cause him a great deal of difficulty. Sid's nice guy attitude is quick to win the affections of Cassie, but Sid is oblivious, which leads to him hurting her feelings on numerous occasions. Sid is also very intelligent but underperforms in school because he is easily distracted and lacks direction. When faced with failing his coursework however, Sid is able to write an entire history dissertation in one night. His characterisation is often completed by his choice of clothes, including a bright yellow 'Mega Dog' T-shirt, which includes a button which when pressed produces a 'Mega Dog' catchphrase from a sewn on speaker.Skins: Sid Recap - TV.com In an interview with Sky, Mike says: It could be inferred from the meek manner in which Sid accepts the manipulation of Tony, and the anger of his Scottish father Mark, that Sid is weak, and his self-esteem is certainly low. But on the occasions when it is most needed, he shows remarkable strength of character, especially in the episode \\"Sid\\". When Sid's father fails to prevent his mother leaving, Sid explodes with anger, and this demonstration of strength improves Sid's relationship with his father in the long run. Also, Sid goes on a 'mission of love' to profess his love to Cassie in the final episode of the first series, and later in the second series where he searches for her in New York City. He shows Cassie's picture in Times Square, but no one recognizes her. This results in his going to her job at a diner, which she told him she works at through postcards. They just miss each other in the window, and it is never shown if Sid turns around to see her, although is implied in Pure that he does. In the series 2 finale, it is shown that Sid attains a B and two Cs on his A-level finals, even though he didn't apply to university. Character history =Series 1= In \\"Tony\\" he is promised by Tony that Sid will lose his virginity to Cassie before he turns seventeen. He also loses the cannabis for Abigail Stock's party, putting drug dealer Madison Twatter out to find him. Sid pines for Michelle, unaware of Cassie's presence. In \\"Cassie\\", Cassie comes to think Sid loves her and is sending her messages saying to eat, but later realises it's all in her head. Madison Twatter becomes a substitute teacher at Sid's school. In \\"Jal\\", Madison corners Sid and Jal, smashes the latter's clarinet and steals Sid's credit cards. Jal's brothers, thinking he is the problem, beat up Sid before chasing after Madison and his associate., to which they are hospitalised. In \\"Sid\\", he is grounded by his father Mark and has to cancel the date arranged with Cassie in the previous episode.. When later he is offered by Tony a chance to see Michelle, he takes it. After being beaten up by chav girls, he finds Cassie waiting at his house, upset he had stood her up. She tries to be positive, but is hurt and jealous that Michelle has his love without earning it. After Tony makes Sid believe he can have Michelle, he takes her back before his eyes, affirming his power over them both. Cassie, distraught by Sid's ignorance takes an overdose of pills combined with vodka, and ends up in hospital, accompanied by Jal Fazer, who places the blame squarely on Sid. Later on, it is revealed Sid's mother Liz has moved out due to her husband's behaviour, to which Sid stands up to his father, grounds him and spends the night finishing his History coursework. In \\"Maxxie and Anwar\\", he helps Anwar liberate a girl from what they believe to be her abusive father, although he turns out to be her husband. He also sees a picture of Cassie drawn by Maxxie Oliver, remarking on how beautiful he has made her look. \\"Michelle\\" is the episode where Sid realises he really wants Cassie. After a rebounding Michelle attempts to have sex with him, he realises that his love for her is at a level where she can only be his friend. They then both go to find Cassie at her rehab clinic, to tell her. After Sid confesses he likes her, she reveals her new boyfriend, also at the clinic. In \\"Effy\\", Sid is dragged by Tony to help him find his missing sister, Effy Stonem. Eventually, Sid and Tony come to blows, deriding each other's perceived character flaws: Tony sees Sid as wishing to emulate him, whereas Sid sees Tony as something he would never want to become. Later, Sid sees Cassie, agrees to meet with her, and the two finally kiss. Their reunion is cut short by a call from Michelle, which prompts him to try to find Tony and Effy who may be in danger. After he takes Tony and Effy to the hospital, he is the one to defend Tony, who he refers to as his best friend, against his parents' accusations. Sid spends the beginning of the first series finale wondering about Cassie and attempts to write a letter explaining how much he loves her. Sid hurriedly dresses in mismatching clothes and rushes to Cassie's rehab clinic, just after she leaves in a taxi. In the clinic, the nurse locks Sid in a padded room, deducing that Sid needs their help. Tony comes to his aid and Sid is released from the clinic and the two then look for Cassie. At the end of the episode, it is revealed after Sid left Anwar's party he was meeting with Cassie, who is sitting on a bench overlooking Bristol. He sits besides her, where they then hold hands. =Series 2= In the second series, Sid's relationship with Cassie deteriorates and he begins to distance himself from Tony, who has awakened from his coma and is slowly recovering from the brain damage inflicted by his accident. In \\"Tony and Maxxie\\", Sid refuses to visit Tony, who becomes frustrated by the lack of contact from his former best friend. In the \\"Lost Weeks\\", web episodes, it is revealed that Sid was the one who attended to Tony in hospital following the accident, reading entire novels out loud to a comatose Tony and even recording messages to help \\"wake\\" him up. Sid also struggles with not being able to see Cassie. Sid reveals that he lost his virginity to Cassie before she moved to Scotland, but there is a lack of contact between them, which Sid resents. In \\"Sid\\", he misinterprets Cassie's closeness with her gay Scottish friend and angrily accuses her of cheating on him, later destroying the laptop he used to communicate with her. In the same episode, a family visit proves too much for Mark to take and he dies, his body discovered by Sid the next morning. Still in shock, Sid goes to school as usual, but finally breaks down in front of Tony while at a concert. The two end up going back to Sid's house together to deal with the situation, which seems to patch up their damaged friendship. At the end of the episode, Sid is seen on a train, presumably headed to Scotland to see Cassie. At the same time, Cassie is seen taking a train in the opposite direction, presumably to visit Sid in Bristol. In \\"Michelle\\", a grieving Sid ends up having sex with his longstanding crush Michelle - who has also given up on Tony - while on a camping trip. Sid and Michelle are soon caught kissing in Sid's bedroom by Cassie, who had returned from Scotland to see Sid. In \\"Chris\\", Cassie angrily confront Sid and Michelle in front of their friends after running into the couple at a club. This also exposes Sid and Michelle's new relationship to Tony, who seems hurt by it. Sid attempts to explain things, but Cassie slaps him, telling him that he can't do whatever he wants even though his father is dead. In \\"Tony\\", Sid goes with Michelle to try to make amends with Tony, but it proves difficult as Tony is hiding under his bed. After coming back from the university interview, Tony finds Sid and Michelle having sex in the toilets of a club, where he tells them he loves them both, and even kisses Sid, saying he loves him even though he's a \\"useless fucker\\". Tony also tells Sid that he neither loves nor belongs with Michelle, he belongs with Cassie. In \\"Effy\\", Sid has to do Effy's art coursework in exchange for her \\"sorting out his fucking soap opera\\". When he finishes, after describing his emotion as \\"Hopeless\\" in her CW, sees pictures of Cassie kissing another boy, which Effy had taken and attached to him. Horrified, Sid goes to Cassie's house and finally confronts her. The two reconcile. In the series two finale, Sid is told by Chris's dad that the gang can not attend the funeral so he and Tony steal Chris's coffin. They return it when Jal and Michelle demand that they do so. Sid is forgiven by Tony and given a ticket to New York to find Cassie. Tony hugs him and tells him to lose the hat as it \\"makes you look retarded\\" and that he always \\"loved him [Sid] best\\". He arrives in New York with a photograph of Cassie and eventually walks past the restaurant where she is working. He is turning his head to face the window where he will undoubtedly see her standing when the episode ends. =Post-Series 2= In the first episode of series 3, JJ, Freddie and Cook opened Sid's locker, discovering his beanie, the \\"Asian Fanny Fun\\" magazine as well as his name written inside. Cook acknowledges Sid, stating \\"I don't know who this Sid guy is, but he has a great taste in gash.\\" All of Sid's possessions in the locker are then set on fire by Cook as part of a dare concocted by Effy. In the sixth episode of series 5, \\"Asian Fanny Fun\\" appears again, a reference to Sid. In Skins Pure, Cassie returns to London from America. Whether Sid found her in New York or not is not directly confirmed, but Cassie states in a conversation with her roommate that before moving to London she was traveling around America with a boy, but decided to end the relationship because it couldn't go any further. Cassie stated that if the relationship didn't end, it would have lasted forever. Cassie does not give the boy's name, but Skins co-creator Bryan Elsley, who wrote the episode, confirmed that this was intended as a reference to Sid.

Ship history The ship was built by Caird & Company of Greenock, Scotland, in 1875 and operated by the Nederlandsch Indische Stoomboot Maatschappij (\\"Netherlands Indies Steamship Company\\") until 1891, when the assets and business of the company was taken over by the Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (\\"Royal Packet Navigation Company\\"). She was named after James Loudon (1824‚Äì1900), a Dutch politician and governor of the Dutch East Indies (1872-1875). In 1883, while captained by Johan Lindemann, the ship was present at the eruption of Krakatoa and survived the subsequent tsunami when the captain steered the ship head on into the wave. After the wave passed, pyroclastic airfall was the ship's biggest enemy. A foot of ash could have made the ship capsize, but everyone on board all survived because the combination of the crew keeping the decks clear of ash and Captain Lindeman's decision to move the passengers into the ship's hold to maintain stability kept them alive long enough to ride out the effects of the eruption. After surviving the tsunami caused by the eruption of Krakatoa, the ship was stranded and lost in the Flores Sea off the Tengga Batoe reef south of Selayar Island in 1898. In popular culture The 1953 American adventure film Fair Wind to Java depicts a fictional sailing ship, the Gerrymander, which rides out a large tsunami generated by the 1883 explosion of Krakatoa. The 1969 American disaster film Krakatoa, East of Java depicts a fictional steamer, the Batavia Queen, surviving an encounter with an enormous tsunami at sea between Krakatoa and Java in 1883. Both scenes apparently were inspired at least in part by the historical experience of the Governor General Loudon. The 2005 British documentary Krakatoa and the 2006 BBC Television docudrama Krakatoa: The Last Days (aired in the United States on the Discovery Channel with the title Krakatoa: Volcano of Destruction) both depict the experience of the Governor General Loudon and Captain Lindemann in the Sunda Strait during the 1883 eruption.

History  The station opened as Abattoirs railway station on 12 July 1913, at the same time the Gepps Cross Abattoirs opened adjacent to the station. The station was located just to the west of Gawler Road (later Main North Road), and the name was changed to Pooraka probably to match the name of the local suburb on 5 December 1940. (Note that the 1949 edition of Gregory's Street Directory of Adelaide and Suburbs however still retains the old station name).

It was founded in 1919 and is situated in Paola . The high standard of Marsovin wines is attributed partly to Malta‚Äôs favourable climatic conditions but also to the stringent controls maintained by experts from the viticultural aspect to the vinification process in order to ensure that the optimum level of quality is achieved. Such quality has also been recognised by independent parties through the years when Marsovin wines have been put to the test by participating in international competitions and awarded gold, silver and bronze medals. Such competitions include Efffervescents du Monde, International Wine Challenge, Challenge du Vin, Emozioni del Mondo amongst others. Today, Marsovin owns 199.7 tumoli of land which make up their five Estates, testimony to Marsovin‚Äôs commitment to the culture of wine. These Estates are owned by Marsovin and the Cassar family and are specifically intended for the production of premium quality, single-estate wines. Over the recent years Marsovin has also introduced several wines into its portfolio all of which are produced from contracted land, owned by Maltese and Gozitan who produce grapes according to Marsovin‚Äôs specifications, Marsovin currently contracts a total of 1116 tumoli/125 hectares. Marsovin has an extensive variety of brands in its portfolio from table wines all the way through to Single Vineyard, Methode Traditionnelle and high profile sweet wines. Due to the fact that Marsovin has been established from so many years, since 1919, the winery has been in the fortunate position where it could slowly build up an extensive range of wines for different palates and budgets. These wines are classified either as table wines, I.G.T Maltese islands, D.O.K Malta or Gozo, D.O.K Superior, Single Vineyard Estate wines and Boutique wines. Marsovin has been the pioneer in wine making in Malta during the course of its history. In the early 70‚Äôs Marsovin was the first to come out with a Mono varietals range of wines, which at the time stood as Malta‚Äôs most premium wine. In the early Marsovin planted its largest ever vineyard in the south of Malta, Marnisi between ≈ªejtun and Marsaxlokk. This vineyard then produced two wines of noble character, Antonin and Marnisi both of which well known in Malta as two of the leading premium red wines on the island. Following this Marsovin moved onto its next great achievement, the production of the first ever Brut, methode classique from the chardonnay grape variety, Cassar De Malte. This project started off in 1997 to then be launched at the Millennium. Needless to say that in between these great milestones for the winery, Marsovin also introduced other very significant brands such as Grand Maitre which was launched in 1999, this wine today is recognized by many wine enthusiasts on the island as Malta's most distinguished premium red wine. Marsovin is the only wine maker in Malta that produces sparkling wine. The Cassar de Malte is vinified using the same procedures of the methode traditionnelle used to create champagne. This Marsovin wine takes its name from the wine-making family, in keeping with tradition. It is made from Chardonnay grapes harvested from the family‚Äôs private 15-tumolo estate in Wardija, where there are 7,500 vines. No more than 8,000 bottles are produced from each harvest, and the process takes more than two years, including two fermentations and 15 months in which the bottles are left to lie on lees, allowing the conversion of yeast into sediment. The bottles are placed on special racks called pupitres where they are turned by hand every day for four weeks in a process called riddling or remuage in French, so that the sediment collects in the neck, from where it is finally removed to allow the addition of the liqueur d‚Äôespedition, which determines its classification as Brut. Today Marsovin has a presence in the United States Of America, Japan, China, Hong Kong and ships directly to end-consumers worldwide.  History  After World War I Chev. Anthony Cassar founded a wine company with the name of A. & G. Cassar. Since 1956 the firm still owned by the Cassar family has been called Marsovin Ltd.. In the beginning, only imported grapes were pressed, but since the 1950s Marsovin has its own vineyards , where red and white grapes are grown, mostly French types.

She is played by April Pearson. Characterisation Michelle is portrayed initially as primarily interested in serving her boyfriend Tony Stonem's needs and in \\"looking shaggable\\" which she places as her primary function, compared with Jal Fazer's interest in the clarinet. She is very confident in her appearance; on the Skins website in a Myspace-style \\"about me\\" section, she protests that her photos have not been Photoshopped, and that she is \\"this gorgeous in real life\\".Channel 4 Skins - Us - Michelle She is well aware that Tony's friend, Sid is in love with her, and sometimes wonders if he would be a better boyfriend than Tony. She is often angry at Tony for him calling her \\"nips\\" in reference to her nipples, and protesting that her breasts are uneven. Despite lack of academic interest, she is a very talented linguist. It is stated that she is very talented with languages and seems to be fluent in French and Spanish. Also, in the first episode of Series One, she seems to understand Italian when it is spoken near her. It is also hinted in the last episode of series 2 that her oldest/longest known friend is Chris Miles when she says she first met him when she was 7. However, on the Skins website she states that she and her best friend Jal have been in the same class since they were 4. On Michelle's MySpace page she says that her favourite musicians are Stevie Nicks, Peaches and Eminem, but she doesn't like Keane and James Blunt. Her favourite films are Mean Girls, The Emperor's New Groove and The Last Seduction, and her favourite television series are One Tree Hill, Scrubs and Extreme Makeover; stating the latter brings her to tears. Michelle was one of the original characters from Jamie Brittain's original concept for the series. He has stated in an interview that her name was originally Annie. She, Sid and Tony were the characters in Brittain's novel he wrote as a teenager, but never finished. Jamie Brittain has said that while his original story line wasn't strong enough, he believed the characters were strong enough to carry in a television series. Character history =Series 1= In the first episode Michelle has convinced one of her best friends, Cassie Ainsworth, to take friend Sid's virginity, at her boyfriend Tony's request. In \\"Jal\\" she starts to worry about Tony's interest in posh girl Abigail Stock, and in \\"Chris\\", she laments that she feels Tony who she loves will never love her in the way Sid does. In \\"Sid\\", as an experiment, Tony kisses Abigail at a concert before Michelle's eyes to prompt her to angrily break up with him, especially when she \\"catches\\" him fondling Abigail backstage. After a brief run in with some chav girls where she's assaulted, emotional and upset, she tells Sid she believes he was in on her humiliation and becomes angry with him as well. Tony urges Sid to try to score with Michelle on the rebound, and just as Michelle appears to find comfort in him, Tony appears and forces Sid to watch as he takes Michelle back instantly, affirming his power over them both. In \\"Maxxie and Anwar\\", she and her best friend Jal attempt to reconnect while on a school trip in Russia, going out to a bar and getting incredibly drunk. Believing she is passed out, Tony attempts to seduce Maxxie Oliver although Michelle is in the same room. However, she is completely conscious, and witnesses everything up until Maxxie abruptly stops, just before Tony tries to go further sexually. The next day on the plane home, Michelle doesn't confront Tony immediately, but rather tries to get him to tell her first by subtly probing him, but he fails to confess. Michelle finally breaks up with Tony at the start of the next episode \\"Michelle\\". When Jal questions if Tony cheated \\"again\\", Michelle is hurt when she finds out that Jal has known about Tony's past infidelity (which includes Abigail, who Tony promised he never cheated with), and has never told her. Maxxie also comes to Michelle, where he apologises and begs her not to tell anybody what had happened in Russia. Although Michelle becomes depressed and even gets caught by Angie drinking in the school supply room, she is adamant about not seeing Tony, and has been ignoring his pursuits to get her back. Meanwhile, at home she is becoming hugely annoyed with her mother's latest husband, Malcolm, feeling that he uses her mother, in addition to his rude habits. At school, she gets the chance to confront Abigail, and is introduced to Abi's brother, Josh. Tony later tries to talk to Michelle, and she asks him to \\"prove\\" that he loves her completely, but he is unconvincing. Michelle then turns to Sid on the rebound, as she is well aware that he has been in love with her for many years. She discovers that Sid, surprisingly, has come to love her as just a friend, so she takes him to see Cassie ‚Äî Sid's true love ‚Äî who has gone back into rehab after a suicide attempt. At the rehab clinic, she bumps into Josh once again, who asks her out on a date. Michelle finds that she genuinely enjoys her time with Josh, and is able to have an equal conversation with him, unlike Tony who she describes as difficult to talk to. She learns that Josh's mother, a psychiatrist, medicates him, but otherwise their relationship progresses nicely. Meanwhile, Tony has been spying on her, and eventually sabotages her and Josh's developing relationship by sending lurid pictures of Abigail from Josh's phone to Michelle. Michelle finds comfort with Jal, but is both distraught and disgusted with Josh‚Äîfiguring the photos were related to his mental illness. Later, after helping to repair her mother and stepfather's hollow relationship, Tony makes another futile attempt to regain Michelle as his girlfriend, in spite of a slightly better attempt to explain that he loves her‚Äîhowever Michelle rejects him. In the series finale, Michelle briefly visits Tony's sister Effy Stonem, who was just recently involved in an incident orchestrated by Josh to get back at Tony for the events in the episode \\"Michelle\\". Although Effy doesn't speak, Michelle asks her why Tony hurt her, but Effy genuinely doesn't know. Michelle shows Effy some affection before leaving. Later in the episode Michelle attends with Jal to friend Anwar Kharral's 17th birthday party. Tony comes as well, along with Effy, but neither of them actually go inside. Effy calls Tony a \\"wanker\\" for hurting Michelle, and he finally calls her on his phone to confess his love to her. Michelle listens to the phone while crying, and just as Tony crosses the street, he is hit by a bus. Michelle can be seen calling presumably an ambulance at the end of the episode. =Series 2= In the second series, it is learned that Michelle has had no contact with Tony during the six months after his accident. Instead she has been drinking at bars, flirting with men, and presumably having sex as well. It is clear that she is confused how to approach the situation with Tony, although she is quite aware that what she has been doing is wrong. In addition to her problems with Tony, her relationship with Sid is strained, an example of this being seen when Sid catches Michelle dancing with two guys and snogging at a club, to which she runs away guilty and humiliated having been seen. Later in the episode, through an emotional confession to Sid, we learn that Michelle has gone to see Tony only once since the accident. School eventually resumes and Michelle is now in her final year of college. In an Unseen Skins episode, Maxxie encourages Michelle to sign up for the school play (Osama! The Musical). Although Michelle declines because of stage fright, she eventually auditions where she shows she has an aptitude for singing, and eventually gets the lead role alongside Maxxie. During a kissing scene during rehearsal between Maxxie, Sketch ‚Äì Maxxie's stalker ‚Äì puts Michelle's life into danger when she purposely drops a heavy stage light out of jealousy. Later at a costume fund- raising party for drama, Michelle wears a costume modeled on Princess Leia, only to be insulted by Abigail, who is also dressed as Leia. To make matters worse she came to the party with Tony, who is dressed as Luke Skywalker. Michelle is hurt that Tony dressed \\"for\\" Abigail, although Tony is unclear himself of the circumstances of his costume, let alone his relationship with Abigail. Michelle takes Tony into a private area where she confronts Tony as to why he took Abigail to the party. We learn that Abigail has been convincing Tony that she is his girlfriend, not Michelle. After both a failed attempt at seducing Tony and being deeply hurt that Tony doesn't remember her, Michelle comes to realisation that Tony isn't the same person anymore. When word gets around that Sketch was assaulted by their Drama teacher, Bruce‚Äîa false story made up by Sketch‚ÄîMichelle shows kindness and compassion when she attempts to befriend her and invites her to sit with her during lunch. Michelle learns Sketch's true nature only when she gives her pills that make her sick, causing her to drop out of the school play just moments before the show (and subsequently fulfilling the role). In episode 4 Michelle once again asks Tony how much he remembers, however he doesn't remember much if anything about their relationship at all. When Michelle tries to seduce Tony, Tony has developed an erectile dysfunction, which frustrates Michelle and prompts her to slap him, blaming him for his accident and subsequent condition. Although she apologises, she tells Tony she cannot wait for him and the two officially end their relationship. Before leaving Tony gives her an early birthday gift, and Michelle invites him along on her birthday camping trip, to which he declines. Meanwhile, we learn that her mother has ended her relationship with Malcolm, and has recently married one of her clients, Ted. They have also moved in with him into his newly renovated upscale home, which Michelle dislikes greatly. To make matters worse, Ted has a spoiled daughter named Scarlett‚Äîwho are alarmingly too close for comfort for Michelle‚Äîwho decides she'd move in as well. At school, Scarlett wins Michelle's friends over with her charm and sex appeal. When she invites herself on the camping trip, offering the use of her car, Michelle feels annoyed. On the trip she feels alone and irritated with Scarlett's presence there, and finds comfort from both Sid and Maxxie. Later that night she catches Scarlett trying to seduce Sid, and finally decides to confront her. However she learns that Scarlett isn't as much of a bad person as she pretends to be, and goes after Sid instead. In an intense moment, Sid expresses his grief to Michelle over his recently deceased father, and the two of them kiss and make love for the first time with each other on the beach. They decide to keep their relationship private, feeling that they're not ready to tell their friends, and preferring to spend more time with each other. However, after returning to Sid's home where they passionately attempt to have sex in Sid's bedroom, they're interrupted by Sid's girlfriend Cassie, who has been watching the entire time from Sid's bed. Cassie blatantly announces to the gang of Michelle and Sid's new relationship, much to everyone's surprise. Tony pretends not to care, however Jal is angered that Michelle didn't tell her since she's her best friend. Michelle and Sid remain, even if apologetically, together however. It isn't until one night at a club, at the end of the episode \\"Tony\\", Tony confronts Michelle and Sid in the bathroom stall during sex. Tony, who is finally ready, tells Michelle that they're meant to be together, opposed to her and Sid, who is meant to be with Cassie. Sid admits that he isn't in love with Michelle anymore, leaving Michelle both shocked at Sid's change of heart and Tony's sudden determination. In \\"Effy\\", Tony spends the episode trying to reach Michelle, who is ignoring his many phone calls and text messages. It is apparent that she wants nothing to do with him, especially after he ruined her relationship, and even sends the watch he got her for her birthday back to him. However Effy gets the watch fixed, engraved with the word \\"forever\\", and sends it back to Michelle, finally softening Michelle enough to answer Tony's phone call. At the very ending of the episode, she answers the phone, with merely \\"I love you too\\" before hanging it up again. In the next two episodes leading up to the finale we learn that Michelle and Tony are trying to take their relationship \\"slow\\" and to not \\"make a thing of it\\". She's worried about their relationship what with exams interfering, and Jal's time of need ever since the death of friend Chris, keeping them apart. Although she proclaims to still be angry about the situation, her and Tony seem genuinely happy together, if not a bit sheepish in each other's presence. Tony can be seen bringing her flowers, walking her to class, and carrying her books‚Äîtheir relationship is progressing. However, in the finale of the series, Michelle receives her A-levels: 2 As and 1 B, and she has plans to further her studies at York, whereas Tony plans on attending Cardiff. There is tension between the two as they inwardly struggle how they'll deal with their relationship, what with their plans on going to separate universities. In the last moments of the series' finale, Michelle and Tony reflect on their relationship in a private moment, leaving the audience dubious whether they're going to continue their relationship or say goodbye forever.

A magazine of that name was reportedly being published in 1899 and 1903. Horatio Bottomley, an MP for the Liberal Party, became the publisher of the magazine on 12 May 1906. It continued production during the First World War. Howard Cox estimates its sales by August 1914 at in excess of three quarters of a million copies a week. By the end of October 1914 the cover of John Bull was '\\"boasting that the magazine‚Äôs circulation was the largest of any weekly journal in the world\\". It was the subject of a libel case in 1919 concerning a biographical film about David Lloyd George. In 1920, the company was merged into Odhams Press. In 1923, the magazine was said to be 'ultra patriotic'. Around that time, the editor was Geoffrey Williamson. The magazine was in print in 1931, 1939 and 1944. The magazine was published by Odhams from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Similar in style to the American magazine The Saturday Evening Post, the John Bull covers encapsulated post-war Britain and employed some of Britain's finest illustrators. They also included short stories by major British authors such as H. E. Bates, Agatha Christie, Nicholas Monsarrat, N. J. Crisp, Gerald Kersh, J. B. Priestley and C. S. Forester.

He is the founding director of the Gomidas Institute in London, which sponsors and carries out research and publishes books on modern Armenian and regional studies.  Early life  Sarafian was born in July 1961 in Cyprus. In 1974, while he and his parents were on holiday in London, the Turkish military invaded North Cyprus and his family became refugees. He decided to learn Turkish so that he could challenge the Turkish state's denial of the Armenian Genocide and applied to study the language in Ankara. When the Turkish Ministry of Education turned down his application to study, he went anyway, paying for his tuition by teaching English. According to a New Yorker profile, \\"coming to Turkey transformed him, in an unexpected way. The combined effect of getting to know Turkish citizens, of higher education, of maturity, and of changing Turkish politics eroded the teen-age hatred until he began to seek out opportunities for reconciliation.\\" Sarafian attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in the United States and earned his M.A. in history under the tutelage of Ronald Grigor Suny.  Gomidas Institute  Sarafian co- founded the Gomidas Institute at the University of Michigan in 1992 and has served as its executive director ever since. The institute is now based in London. Among its book publications are English translations of Armenian texts related to the Armenian Genocide. It also publishes the journal Armenian Forum. Additionally, Gomidas has published Talaat Pasha's report on the Armenian Genocide and a critical edition of The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916, commonly known as the Blue Book (originally published in 1916 by British historians Lord James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee), as well as a Turkish edition of the book.

In February 2007, Sarafian accepted the suggestion of the then-chairman of the Turkish Historical Society, Yusuf Hala√ßoƒülu, to cooperate on a joint project. Sarafian later proposed a joint case study of \\"what happened on the Harput Plain\\" and \\"how many people died\\" during the deportations. A month later, Hala√ßoƒülu announced that Sarafian has declined to carry out the study, and added that Sarafian \\"was disturbed by the institute's initiative to study the archives of Tashnak, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation\\". In an interview, Sarafian said Hala√ßoƒülu's \\"explanation was not true because I had not said any such thing. The case study came to an end when Hala√ßoƒülu stated that the relevant records, which he had initially agreed to use as the basis of the joint case study, were not available.\\" Hala√ßoƒülu's choice to withhold archival records and pull out of the project was criticized at the time in the Turkish press.

According to the laws of mechanics, the energy should be a constant of motion and should not change. However, in simulations the energy might fluctuate on a short time scale and increase or decrease on a very long time scale due to numerical integration artifacts that arise with the use of a finite time step Œît. This is somewhat similar to the flying ice cube problem, whereby numerical errors in handling equipartition of energy can change vibrational energy into translational energy. More specifically, the energy tends to increase exponentially; its increase can be understood intuitively because each step introduces a small perturbation Œ¥v to the true velocity vtrue, which (if uncorrelated with v, which will be true for simple integration methods) results in a second-order increase in the energy : E = \\\\sum m \\\\mathbf{v}^{2} = \\\\sum m \\\\mathbf{v}_{true}^{2} + \\\\sum m \\\\ \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{v}^{2} (The cross term in v ¬∑ Œ¥v is zero because of no correlation.) Energy drift - usually damping - is substantial for numerical integration schemes that are not symplectic, such as the Runge-Kutta family. Symplectic integrators usually used in molecular dynamics, such as the Verlet integrator family, exhibit increases in energy over very long time scales, though the error remains roughly constant. These integrators do not in fact reproduce the actual Hamiltonian mechanics of the system; instead, they reproduce a closely related \\"shadow\\" Hamiltonian whose value they conserve many orders of magnitude more closely. The accuracy of the energy conservation for the true Hamiltonian is dependent on the time step. The energy computed from the modified Hamiltonian of a symplectic integrator is \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\left(\\\\Delta t^{p}\\\\right) from the true Hamiltonian. Energy drift is similar to parametric resonance in that a finite, discrete timestepping scheme will result in nonphysical, limited sampling of motions with frequencies close to the frequency of velocity updates. Thus the restriction on the maximum step size that will be stable for a given system is proportional to the period of the fastest fundamental modes of the system's motion. For a motion with a natural frequency œâ, artificial resonances are introduced when the frequency of velocity updates, \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\Delta t} is related to œâ as : \\\\frac{n}{m}\\\\omega = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\Delta t} where n and m are integers describing the resonance order. For Verlet integration, resonances up to the fourth order \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{m} = 4\\\\right) frequently lead to numerical instability, leading to a restriction on the timestep size of : \\\\Delta t < \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{\\\\omega} \\\\approx 0.225p where œâ is the frequency of the fastest motion in the system and p is its period.Schlick T. (2002). Molecular Modeling and Simulation: An Interdisciplinary Guide. Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics series, vol. 21. Springer: New York, NY, USA. . See pp420-430 for complete derivation. The fastest motions in most biomolecular systems involve the motions of hydrogen atoms; it is thus common to use constraint algorithms to restrict hydrogen motion and thus increase the maximum stable time step that can be used in the simulation. However, because the time scales of heavy- atom motions are not widely divergent from those of hydrogen motions, in practice this allows only about a twofold increase in time step. Common practice in all-atom biomolecular simulation is to use a time step of 1 femtosecond (fs) for unconstrained simulations and 2 fs for constrained simulations, although larger time steps may be possible for certain systems or choices of parameters. Energy drift can also result from imperfections in evaluating the energy function, usually due to simulation parameters that sacrifice accuracy for computational speed. For example, cutoff schemes for evaluating the electrostatic forces introduce systematic errors in the energy with each time step as particles move back and forth across the cutoff radius if sufficient smoothing is not used. Particle mesh Ewald summation is one solution for this effect, but introduces artifacts of its own. Errors in the system being simulated can also induce energy drifts characterized as \\"explosive\\" that are not artifacts, but are reflective of the instability of the initial conditions; this may occur when the system has not been subjected to sufficient structural minimization before beginning production dynamics. In practice, energy drift may be measured as a percent increase over time, or as a time needed to add a given amount of energy to the system. The practical effects of energy drift depend on the simulation conditions, the thermodynamic ensemble being simulated, and the intended use of the simulation under study; for example, energy drift has much more severe consequences for simulations of the microcanonical ensemble than the canonical ensemble where the temperature is held constant. However, it has been shown that long microcanonical ensemble simulations can be performed with insignificant energy drift, including those of flexible molecules which incorporate constraints. Energy drift is often used as a measure of the quality of the simulation, and has been proposed as one quality metric to be routinely reported in a mass repository of molecular dynamics trajectory data analogous to the Protein Data Bank.

It is located near pueblo Las Varas and about north of Puerto Vallarta. The name means \\"where there are shrimp\\" in N√°huatl, and is part of the coastline known as the Riviera Nayarita. The population consists of approximately 300 full-time residents, but can swell to over 1000 during Mexico's most popular vacation periods such as Semana Santa, (Easter Week) and Christmas. Chacala is known for its physical beauty, unhurried lifestyle. History left =Pre-Columbian era= The region encompassing Nayarit and Jalisco was originally home to the Texcoxquin (Teqectequi) indigenous culture millennia before the European conquest. The Altavista petroglyphs, not far from Chacala, are believed to date from 2300 BCE. This extensive group of rock carvings is still used today for ceremonial religious purposes by the native Huichol. =Colonial era= The bay was first seen by Europeans when the Spaniard Francisco Cort√©s de Buena Ventura, a nephew of Hern√°n Cort√©s, reached here in 1524. Although Chacala was never as historically significant a port as San Blas to the north or Puerto Vallarta to the south, the sheltered bay saw a visit from explorer Sebastian Rodriguez Cerme√±o, sailing out of Manila, who arrived in Chacala on January 7, 1596 in a small launch after the Manila Galleon San Agustin was wrecked on the northern coast of California. The notable but idiosyncratic Jesuit missionary Father Eusebius Francesco K√ºhn, commonly known as 'Padre Kino', and his party departed from Chacala on his Atondo expedition in May 1683. Many members of the expedition abandoned him after he proposed that his ship be pushed across the Sonoran Desert. =Modern era= After slumbering for decades as a small fishing village and coconut plantation, Mexican doctor Laura del Valle's arrival in 1980 spurred a period of change which, in a relatively brief 15 years, transformed the town into one of Mexico's more distinctive destinations. Del Valle first built simple accommodations at Chacala's south end, where dense virgin first-growth rainforest teeming with wildlife, including ocelot, margay and jaguarundi, grows down the flanks of a small collapsed volcano and plunges into the Pacific. She built the lodge to house visiting American medical students volunteering at the local health clinic she founded to serve the Mexican poor. Today it has evolved into a Retreat & Wellness Center called Mar de Jade that still supports and runs a variety of non-profit projects for the local community and the neighboring impoverished farming town of Las Varas. A Zen Buddhist with a strong commitment to helping the less-fortunate, the word of del Valle's work soon spread, and Chacala started attracting others with similar ideals, along with 'eco-tourists' looking for a tranquil, unspoiled and little-visited beach-town 'off the beaten path'. Another distinctive establishment is the Hotel Majahua whose owners, Carmen and Jos√© Enrique work to develop a socially responsible tourism industry, working with the local fishing community. Over the next decade-and-a-half others looking for an environ where efforts to help a local populace resulted in changes which could be seen and felt, or those just looking for an idyllic charming beach-town found their way to Chacala. Two events in the mid '90s would change the area dramatically. Chacalilla, the small cove just north of Chacala and the surrounding land was purchased by a developer to build a gated complex with luxury homes ranging from approximately $550,000 to $1,800,000 USD. To provide access to the construction site and town, a paved road from Highway 200 to the beach replaced the often-flooded poor-quality circuitous dirt road which had previously kept all but the most-dedicated from visiting Chacala. Geography =Location= 250px 250px Chacala is located on the south west portion the Nayarit coast, which itself is located about mid-way on the Mexican Pacific Coast. Nayarit encompasses , which makes it a little larger than the state of Maryland in the U.S.A. It has of Pacific coastline. Nayarit is bordered by the states of Sinaloa, Zacatecas and Durango to the north, and by Jalisco to the east and south. The town is off Highway 200 and is situated on the Pacific coastal plain. The coastal plain is the strip of land that runs along most of the west coast of Mexico between the Pacific Ocean and the foothills and mountains. =Climate= Chacala (and all of Nayarit) lies south of the Tropic of Cancer, thus it is located in the true Tropics, and its climate is Tropical ‚Äì hot and humid. The actual classification is 'warm subhumid tropical'. Nayarit is characterized by its high rainfall ‚Äì the fifth highest in the country, averaging 1000-1500mm (40-60 in.) per annum. Some parts of the state receive up to 2640mm (104 in.) of rainfall a year. The rains are concentrated in periods of brief intense thunderstorms, often occurring in the afternoons, most during the summer wet season between May and October, although a lesser but significant winter wet season exists as well. The wet seasons are separated by spring and fall dry seasons. Chacala received moderate to severe damage from Hurricane Kenna in October 2002. =Flora= Nayarit's natural floral habitat consists of tropical coastal savannah, tropical deciduous forest, tropical semi-deciduous forest and riparian wetland. The region also includes large and small tracts of cultivated land. The lush Nayarit jungle is home to over 300 species of orchids alone. The biodiverse tropical deciduous forests of Mexico, such as those of Nayarit's foothills and mountains, contain up to 40% of Mexico's flora and fauna diversity. Parts of the tropical deciduous forest on the Pacific Coast near Nayarit have been found to be among the top 10 most species-rich floral habitats on earth. =Fauna= The fertile coastal plain and lush jungle of the foothills and mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental support a wide variety of fauna, including over 400 bird species, and a rich diversity of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and other animal species. Some of the significant birds include the Amazon Parrot, Tropical Kingbird, Great Kiskadee, Hooded Oriole, and the Blue-footed Booby. Mammals include an incredibly wide range of 'big cats' such as Ocelot, Margay, Jaguar, Jaguarundi and Puma along with deer, wild boar, coati mundi, skunk, badger, coyote, wild rabbit, armadillo, various snakes, lizards, and frogs.

Recent legal initiatives have sought to define the term more inclusively, so that it encompasses all the distinctive sign languages and sign systems native to the country. The first dictionary for LENSEGUA was published in 2000, and privileges the eastern dialect used largely in and around Guatemala City and by non-indigenous Ladino and mestizo populations in the eastern part of the country. A second dialect is \\"spoken\\" in the western part of the country, especially by non-Indigenous mestizo and Ladino populations in and around the country's second largest city, Quetzaltenango, located in the western highlands. The eastern and western dialects are mutually intelligible for the most part, although they employ slightly different signed-alphabets, lexicons, and, to a lesser extent, grammatical forms. In her still-unpublished 2015 doctoral dissertation Linguistic anthropologist Monica Rodr√≠guez noted that there exists some competition between the two dialects. The competition is based not only on loyalty to local variants, but also mutual suspicion that exogenous influences in other dialects are excessive. The presumption is that the different LENSEGUA dialects evidence formative influence from other sign languages, such as Old Costa Rican Sign Language and American Sign Language (ASL), not to mention indigenous substrate sign languages of the region. LENSEGUA is distinct from the sign languages used in Mexico and other neighboring Spanish speaking countries. Lensegua is also distinct from the sign languages used by Indigenous populations of Guatemala and neighboring countries, such as those belonging to the family of related sign languages used by Mayas in the Yucatan Peninsula, Chiapas, and Guatemala, respectively, which have come to be known collectively by the misnomer Mayan sign languages, even though none of the sign languages actually belongs to Mayan language family. A notable difference between LENSEGUA and indigenous sign languages of the region is that LENSEGUA has a manual alphabet and makes use of initialized signs and finger-spellings. For Deaf education, a number of schools, organizations, and service programs in Guatemala not only teach LENSEGUA, but use it their primary language for instruction. Although LENSEGUA holds no official status, municipal and departmental governments have largely allowed language promoters to teach basic lessons on and about LENSEGUA to hearing children in primary and secondary schools across the country, even in indigenous communities, where other indigenous sign languages might be used. Origins Although no detailed study of the origins of LENSEGUA has been published, authors have generally assumed that it is an endogenous creole that emerged in the twentieth century, although they have not conclusively determined when or by what process. The endogenous origin is suggested by lack of similarity between LENSEGUA and foreign sign languages suggests that it is largely of endogenous origin, unlike the national sign language of El Salvador, Salvadoran Sign Language, which is in large part a combination of at least three versions of American Sign Language, imported into El Salvador by different groups at different times. Creole language status has been suggested by the fact that the language has significant influence from OLESCA or Old Costa Rican Sign Language, and more recently, ASL or American Sign Language. Until recently, scholars and native-speakers signers of Lensegua as a First language were reluctant to admit that indigenous substrate languages likely had an influence on the development of LENSEGUA, but increasing recognition that the indigenous sign languages are real languages that likely pre-existed the arrival of Europeans has begun to shift that position. Although the comparison of basic vocabulary in LENSEGUA and indigenous sign languages using Lexicostatistics does not indicate high rates of similitude, non-basic signs show a higher degree of similarity than would be likely by either chance or by purely iconic motivations. Some LENSEGUA signs are identical to indigenous signs. Others are identical except that they include an initialism from LENSEGUA's manual alphabet. Number of Speakers Estimates of the number of speakers of Lensegua and/or Guatemalan Sign Language vary widely, although there is wide agreement that the occurrence of congenital deafness, prelingual deafness, and adult-onset deafness are significantly higher than what the World Health Organization estimates for the global population, due to poverty, lack of access to medicine, distance from hospitals, not to mention potential environmental or genetic reasons. Using research published in 2008 by Elizabeth Parks and Jason Parks of SIL International, the Endangered Languages Project (ELP), estimates that 28,000-256,000 people speak Guatemalan Sign Language, but it notes that estimates have ranged as high as 640,000. The higher numbers are based on estimates of the total population of Guatemalans with significant hearing loss, without acknowledging that there are multiple sign languages in the country. Thus, popular estimates conflate statistics for all sign languages in the country, including not just Lensegua, but also the indigenous sign language or languages used by diverse Maya peoples of Guatemala, including the K'iche' Maya of the Guatemalan department of Totonicap√°n, Solol√°, Quetzaltenango, Suchitep√©quez, and El Quich√©. Purported Official Status Guatemala's national legislature has never recognized a national sign language, despite having considered, but never voted on, at least three legislative bills or 'that would have done so: Bill 3932 of 2009, Bill 5128 of September 9, 2016, and Bill 5603 of August 14, 2019. Each later bill borrowed language significantly from the earlier unapproved bills. All three have proposed that a particular sign language, LENSEGUA, (1) be recognized as the national sign language of Guatemala, and (2) that it be considered simply an acronymic abbreviation for 'or \\"Guatemalan Sign Language.\\" Bills 5128 and 5603 would (3) further recognized \\"Guatemalan Sign Language\\" as the native sign language of the entire deaf community of Guatemala, and thereby actually made the language name embrace a number of diverse sign languages used in the country, including not just LENSEGUA, but also homesign systems and Indigenous sign language of the Meemul Tziij complex used in Guatemala.

Description It is an upright, spreading, leafless shrub, that grows to a height of from 60 to 120 centimetres. It has bright, light yellow clusters of flowers. Distribution and habitat Muehlenbckia horrida subsp. abdita is known only from two populations within the Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde wetland, in the Western Mallee subregion of the Mallee region in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia. It grows in waterlogged silt and sand, on the beds of Lake Bryde and East Lake Bryde. It depends for its survival upon a regular cycle of freshwater flooding followed by drying of the lake bed. Conservation Populations of M. h. subsp. abdita have declined severely in the last thirty years, mainly because of increasing salinity. Salinity loads in the Lakes were measured at around 160 tonnes in 1985, but had increased to around 1200 tonnes in 2005. This increase is attributable to a rising water table caused by widespread clearing for agriculture. Other threats include interruption of the flooding/drying regime because of altered hydrology; and recreational activities such as water skiing. It is estimated that there are about 2000 plants left. There was previously a third population, but these were all dead in 2002, and the population is thought to be unrecoverable.

Ankhu was the father of two further viziers: Resseneb and Iymeru. The family formed a strong dynasty of high court officials. One of the daughters of the couple was called Senebhenas. She was married to the overseer of the half domain Wepwawethotep. The latter was related to Queen Aya, albeit it remains uncertain in which way. Both appear together on the above mentioned stela  Biography  Ankhu is known from several monuments dating to the reigns of the 13th Dynasty kings Khendjer and Sobekhotep II, attesting that he served several kings. Ankhu appears in the Papyrus Boulaq 18 as the head of the court officials. The papyrus may date to the reign of Sobekhotep II, or according to an analysis of the document by Kim Ryholt, it may date to the reign of Imyremeshaw or Sehetepkare Intef. The papyrus mentions a Queen Aya,Wolfram Grajetzki: Court Officials of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom, London 2009 p. 38 whose image appears also on a stela which shows that she was part of Ankhu's family. A stela found at Abydos dated to the reign of Khendjer reports on building works at the Osiris temple. In the Amun temple at Karnak he erected statues of himself, his fatherCairo, Egyptian Museum CG 42034 (JE 36646). and his mother. The latter is one of the very few statues belonging to a woman placed in this temple.Grajetzki: Court Officials of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom, p. 39, fig. 18 Ankhu served at least under two, perhaps even under five, kings of the 13th Dynasty. His situation illustrates that during this period the viziers were the real power behind weak kings. The kings were only in power for a short period, while the viziers remained in power for longer periods.W. C.

PBCs are often used in computer simulations and mathematical models. The topology of two- dimensional PBC is equal to that of a world map of some video games; the geometry of the unit cell satisfies perfect two-dimensional tiling, and when an object passes through one side of the unit cell, it re-appears on the opposite side with the same velocity. In topological terms, the space made by two-dimensional PBCs can be thought of as being mapped onto a torus (compactification). The large systems approximated by PBCs consist of an infinite number of unit cells. In computer simulations, one of these is the original simulation box, and others are copies called images. During the simulation, only the properties of the original simulation box need to be recorded and propagated. The minimum-image convention is a common form of PBC particle bookkeeping in which each individual particle in the simulation interacts with the closest image of the remaining particles in the system. One example of periodic boundary conditions can be defined according to smooth real functions \\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} by : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m }{\\\\partial x_1^m} \\\\phi(a_1,x_2,...,x_n) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m }{\\\\partial x_1^m} \\\\phi(b_1,x_2,...,x_n), : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m }{\\\\partial x_2^m} \\\\phi(x_1,a_2,...,x_n) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m }{\\\\partial x_2^m} \\\\phi(x_1,b_2,...,x_n), : ... , : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m }{\\\\partial x_n^m} \\\\phi(x_1,x_2,...,a_n) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^m }{\\\\partial x_n^m} \\\\phi(x_1,x_2,...,b_n) for all m = 0, 1, 2, ... and for constants a_i and b_i. In molecular dynamics simulations, PBC are usually applied to calculate properties of bulk gasses, liquids, crystals or mixtures. A common application uses PBC to simulate solvated macromolecules in a bath of explicit solvent. Born‚Äìvon Karman boundary conditions are periodic boundary conditions for a special system. In electromagnetics, PBC can be applied for different mesh types to analyze the electromagnetic properties of periodical structures. Requirements and artifacts Three-dimensional PBCs are useful for approximating the behavior of macro-scale systems of gases, liquids, and solids. Three-dimensional PBCs can also be used to simulate planar surfaces, in which case two-dimensional PBCs are often more suitable. Two-dimensional PBCs for planar surfaces are also called slab boundary conditions; in this case, PBCs are used for two Cartesian coordinates (e.g., x and y), and the third coordinate (z) extends to infinity. PBCs can be used in conjunction with Ewald summation methods (e.g., the particle mesh Ewald method) to calculate electrostatic forces in the system. However, PBCs also introduce correlational artifacts that do not respect the translational invariance of the system, and requires constraints on the composition and size of the simulation box. In simulations of solid systems, the strain field arising from any inhomogeneity in the system will be artificially truncated and modified by the periodic boundary. Similarly, the wavelength of sound or shock waves and phonons in the system is limited by the box size. In simulations containing ionic (Coulomb) interactions, the net electrostatic charge of the system must be zero to avoid summing to an infinite charge when PBCs are applied. In some applications it is appropriate to obtain neutrality by adding ions such as sodium or chloride (as counterions) in appropriate numbers if the molecules of interest are charged. Sometimes ions are even added to a system in which the molecules of interest are neutral, to approximate the ionic strength of the solution in which the molecules naturally appear. Maintenance of the minimum-image convention also generally requires that a spherical cutoff radius for nonbonded forces be at most half the length of one side of a cubic box. Even in electrostatically neutral systems, a net dipole moment of the unit cell can introduce a spurious bulk-surface energy, equivalent to pyroelectricity in polar crystals. The size of the simulation box must also be large enough to prevent periodic artifacts from occurring due to the unphysical topology of the simulation. In a box that is too small, a macromolecule may interact with its own image in a neighboring box, which is functionally equivalent to a molecule's \\"head\\" interacting with its own \\"tail\\". This produces highly unphysical dynamics in most macromolecules, although the magnitude of the consequences and thus the appropriate box size relative to the size of the macromolecules depends on the intended length of the simulation, the desired accuracy, and the anticipated dynamics. For example, simulations of protein folding that begin from the native state may undergo smaller fluctuations, and therefore may not require as large a box, as simulations that begin from a random coil conformation. However, the effects of solvation shells on the observed dynamics - in simulation or in experiment - are not well understood. A common recommendation based on simulations of DNA is to require at least 1 nm of solvent around the molecules of interest in every dimension.  Practical implementation: continuity and the minimum image convention  An object which has passed through one face of the simulation box should re-enter through the opposite face‚Äîor its image should do it. Evidently, a strategic decision must be made: Do we (A) ‚Äúfold back‚Äù particles into the simulation box when they leave it, or do we (B) let them go on (but compute interactions with the nearest images)? The decision has no effect on the course of the simulation, but if the user is interested in mean displacements, diffusion lengths, etc., the second option is preferable. = (A) Restrict particle coordinates to the simulation box = To implement a PBC algorithm, at least two steps are needed. Restricting the coordinates is a simple operation which can be described with the following code, where x_size is the length of the box in one direction (assuming an orthogonal unit cell centered on the origin) and x is the position of the particle in the same direction: if (periodic_x) then if (x < -x_size * 0.5) x = x + x_size if (x >= x_size * 0.5) x = x - x_size end if Distance and vector between objects should obey the minimum image criterion. This can be implemented according to the following code (in the case of a one-dimensional system where dx is the distance direction vector from object i to object j): if (periodic_x) then dx = x(j) - x(i) if (dx > x_size * 0.5) dx = dx - x_size if (dx <= -x_size * 0.5) dx = dx + x_size end if In Python, one can do the following: for i in range(0, N): for j in range(0, N): dx1 = x[j] - x[i] dx = np.mod(dx1, x_size * 0.5) For three- dimensional PBCs, both operations should be repeated in all 3 dimensions. These operations can be written in a much more compact form for orthorhombic cells if the origin is shifted to a corner of the box. Then we have, in one dimension, for positions and distances respectively: ! After x(i) update without regard to PBC: x(i) = x(i) - floor(x(i) / x_size) * x_size ! For a box with the origin at the lower left vertex ! Works for x's lying in any image. dx = x(j) - x(i) dx = dx - nint(dx / x_size) * x_size = (B) Do not restrict the particle coordinates = Assuming an orthorhombic simulation box with the origin at the lower left forward corner, the minimum image convention for the calculation of effective particle distances can be calculated with the ‚Äúnearest integer‚Äú function as shown above, here as C/C++ code: x_rsize = 1.0 / x_size; // compute only when box size is set or changed dx = x[j] - x[i]; dx -= x_size * nearbyint(dx * x_rsize); The fastest way of carrying out this operation depends on the processor architecture. If the sign of dx is not relevant, the method dx = fabs(dx); dx -= static_cast(dx * x_rsize + 0.5) * x_size; was found to be fastest on x86-64 processors in 2013. For non- orthorhombic cells the situation is more complicated.Minimum image convention in non-cubic simulation cells In simulations of ionic systems more complicated operations may be needed to handle the long-range Coulomb interactions spanning several box images, for instance Ewald summation. Unit cell geometries PBC requires the unit cell to be a shape that will tile perfectly into a three-dimensional crystal. Thus, a spherical or elliptical droplet cannot be used. A cube or rectangular prism is the most intuitive and common choice, but can be computationally expensive due to unnecessary amounts of solvent molecules in the corners, distant from the central macromolecules. A common alternative that requires less volume is the truncated octahedron. =General dimension= For simulations in 2D and 3D space, cubic periodic boundary condition is most commonly used since it is simplest in coding. In computer simulation of high dimensional systems, however, the hypercubic periodic boundary condition can be less efficient because corners occupy most part of the space. In general dimension, unit cell can be viewed as the Wigner-Seitz cell of certain lattice packing. For example, the hypercubic periodic boundary condition corresponds to the hypercubic lattice packing. It is then preferred to choose a unit cell which corresponds to the dense packing of that dimension. In 4D this is D4 lattice; and E8 lattice in 8-dimension. The implementation of these high dimensional periodic boundary conditions is equivalent to error correction code approaches in information theory. Conserved properties Under periodic boundary conditions, the linear momentum of the system is conserved, but Angular momentum is not. Conventional explanation of this fact is based on Noether's theorem, which states that conservation of angular momentum follows from rotational invariance of Lagrangian. However, this approach was shown to not be consistent: it fails to explain the absence of conservation of angular momentum of a single particle moving in a periodic cell. Lagrangian of the particle is constant and therefore rotationally invariant, while angular momentum of the particle is not conserved. This contradiction is caused by the fact that Noether's theorem is usually formulated for closed systems. The periodic cell exchanges mass momentum, angular momentum, and energy with the neighboring cells. When applied to the microcanonical ensemble (constant particle number, volume, and energy, abbreviated NVE), using PBC rather than reflecting walls slightly alters the sampling of the simulation due to the conservation of total linear momentum and the position of the center of mass; this ensemble has been termed the \\"molecular dynamics ensemble\\" or the NVEPG ensemble. These additional conserved quantities introduce minor artifacts related to the statistical mechanical definition of temperature, the departure of the velocity distributions from a Boltzmann distribution, and violations of equipartition for systems containing particles with heterogeneous masses. The simplest of these effects is that a system of N particles will behave, in the molecular dynamics ensemble, as a system of N-1 particles. These artifacts have quantifiable consequences for small toy systems containing only perfectly hard particles; they have not been studied in depth for standard biomolecular simulations, but given the size of such systems, the effects will be largely negligible.

The film featured Vikram and Sneha in the lead roles, while Vadivelu, Nassar, Janagaraj, and Santhana Bharathi play supporting roles. Dhina scored the film's music, and G. Ramesh handled the cinematography. It released in September 2002. The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu as Remo.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPBHNV5DxxY Plot Raja Krishnamoorthy (Vikram) is the only son of Shanmugam (Nassar), and they live in Hong Kong. One day while travelling, their car meets with an accident, and both get admitted to the hospital. Dr. Cheenu (Santhana Bharathi) is their family doctor who diagnoses their blood and finds that Shanmugam is infected with multiple sclerosis. Cheenu, being a close friend of Shanmugam, tells Raja that Shanmugam‚Äôs life is expected to last for 60 days and requests Raja to keep his father happy, to which Raja agrees. Raja insists that his father get back to India to meet his family. A small flashback is shown where Shanmugam married a girl by his choice against his family's wishes, which made him leave home with his wife. Shanmugam relocated to Hong Kong and set up a business there. Shanmugam‚Äôs wife died when Raja was born, and Shanmugam took care of Raja afterward. Raja knows that his father longs to meet his family again, so he decides to get the family united. Raja and Shanmugam leave to India to meet their family members. Everyone in the family is surprised upon seeing Shanmugam. They share some memories with him, except his father (Janagaraj), who is still angry at him. Raja, on the other, hand is skilled in magic tricks and mimicry and impresses everyone in the family with his skills. Tamil (Sneha) is Shanmugam's niece. She is responsible, loved by everyone in the family, and also takes care of everyone with love and affection. Raja decides to love Tamil after knowing that his father likes her. Raja proposes his love to Tamil, but she declines and says she will marry only the man as per their family‚Äôs wish. Raja creates a scene that Shanmugam's father should talk with Shanmugam, and if not, Raja will commit suicide. Shanmugam also gets united with his father. Raja keeps on frequent touch with Cheenu to keep him updated with Shanmugam‚Äôs condition. One day, Raja gets a headache and becomes colorblind. Shanmugam‚Äôs mobile gets a call from Cheenu. Raja modulates as Shanmugam on the call and actually understands that the disease is actually for him and not his father. Raja continues speaking like his father to confirm the symptoms related to the disease but tries to behave normally. Raja understands that his father has requested Cheenu to lie to Raja, so that Raja will be happy while also making his father happy. Raja feels sad knowing that he has only a few more days to live but does not disclose this to his father and Cheenu. Cheenu calls Raja and informs about a research going on for multiple sclerosis in Europe and insists him to take Shanmugam there to get treated, which might provide a chance for revival. Raja understands that the therapy is intended for him. Raja convinces his father to get back to Hong Kong, for which he agrees. Everyone in the family does not want Shanmugam and Raja to leave and insist them to stay with them. Raja says that there are some pending works and that they need to get back immediately. On the day of leaving, Tamil proposes her love to Raja, for which he does not reply. The movie ends with both Raja and Shanmugam leaving for treatment.

K. Krishnakant, who had earlier worked as the production executive for Lakshmi Movie Makers. The film was written and directed by A. X. Solomon who had directed the Arjun-Sonali Bendre starrer Kannodu Kanbathellam in 1999, under the name Prabhu. However, as that film did not perform to expectations at the box office, the director wanted to be credited as A. X. Solomon for his second Tamil film. He has since gone on to make a career under the name of Prabhu Solomon. The film was initially titled as Vikadan with Suvaluxmi being the first choice of lead actress. During the same period Vikram had accepted another film titled King where he was set to play dual roles, but the film eventually was shelved, hence the title King was chosen to replace Vikadan in this project. Vikram took up magic lessons and learned how to roller-blade for his role in the film.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Dhina. All lyrics written by Vairamuthu. Release The film did not fare well commercially. Post-release, Solomon revealed that he was unconvinced about Vikram portraying the lead role, feeling that he was too old to play Nassar's son, but the actor insisted that the project go ahead. Delays in the production in the film meant that Vikram's star image had risen and reviewers labelled the film as a disappointment upon release. The director noted that the story was written with the expectation of a small-time actor in the lead role, and hence Vikram's sudden popularity worked against the film. He revealed that his early career in film involved making significant compromises and was strictly against the type of cinema he had actually ventured to make.

Early age Hoesli was born in Glarus, Switzerland from a German-Swiss father and a French mother. He later moved at an early age with his family to live in Z√ºrich. After graduating from high school with a mathematics degree he joined ETH Zurich where he obtained a degree in architecture in 1944. Career In 1947 Hoesli moved to Paris, France to join architect Fernand L√©ger's team and later was accepted by Le Corbusier as an assistant. In 1948 he was sent to La Plata, Argentina to supervise the construction of the Curutchet House. A year later, he was appointed to take charge of the Unit√© d'Habitation project in Marseille. =The Texas Rangers= Hoesli moved to the United States in 1951. He first joined the School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of architecture. It was there where he was joined by architects Colin Rowe, John Hejduk and Werner Seligmann among others to form the Texas Rangers group of architects. He then returned to teach at ETH Zurich. =Teaching at the ETH Zurich= In 1959, which Hoesli hails as the year Modern Architecture became teachable worldwide, many opinions on architectural instruction changed. In that year, the year of the death of Frank Lloyd Wright, his Guggenheim museum was completed, as were the Birmingham Museum of Art and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. At this point, Hoesli felt free to discuss the procedure of design with students through pedagogy. His design problems, which \\"were so formulated that the student had to solve tasks within a given framework of requirements and achieve precise results\\",Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Z√ºrich, 1989. p. 24 were arranged by types. The types of problems were created in order to instruct the students in a specific skill through their own self-discovery with trial and error. Hoesli relates this process to the Socratic method, in which students are constantly faced with important questions and debates. When Hoesli began teaching architecture at the ETH in 1959, some of his duties included 'looking after' fifth-year students. At this point, Hoesli realized that most of the fifth-years had an understanding of design as being dependent upon a flash of inspiration rather than a building of design steps upon each other. These students completed projects that had no room for growth or adaptation, and they would not accept criticism or suggestions for improvement. Hoesli felt that this approach was counterproductive and set about changing the way the entire curriculum was structured. Also at the time Hoesli began teaching at the ETH, the design process revolved around different building types. Students would complete an assignment from a specific building group. \\"Design began with a garden house, then continued with a holiday home, family dwelling, then on to a multi-family dwelling, then on to a multi-storey block, school building and shopping centre, until at the end of the studies a church or theatre was ventured upon.\\"Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Z√ºrich, 1989. p. 8 Of the contrary opinion, Hoesli believed that steps of design were more important than mere function. He saw transparency and wise space definition as the ultimate goals for architectural work. \\"Transparency,\\" Hoesli wrote, \\"frees us, because we allow it, to see buildings and structures in connections and independent of the differences between 'historical' and 'modern'.\\"Hoesli, Bernhard. \\"Commentary.\\" Rowe, Colin and Slutzky, Robert. Transparency. Birkhauser:1964 p. 82 He also articulated that transparency as referenced with the modern tradition became an important tool for instruction in the schools of architecture throughout the world. Further, Hoesli felt that students should have the opportunity to branch out in creativity through a more structured process than was present at the ETH. He felt the structure of the ETH curriculum at the time was too dependent on chance and the fleeting feelings of a fine art mentality rather than a practical design process. After his University of Texas experience, Hoesli's leadership skills and persuasive discussions were at their peak. He was able to formulate new course structures and implement them with ease. He also possessed the wherewithal and energy to pursue the course of action he saw as best for the schools. At the time Hoesli decided to alter the ETH\\"s pedagogy, he was delighted to discover a common Modern manifesto arising as society pronounced Modern architecture dead. He stated, \\"In order that the Architecture Department of the ETH can reach the standard of international architectural development, the introduction into architectural design had to be consciously and systematically based on Modern Architecture and the work of its protagonists.\\" He saw the three main protagonists as Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, and Mies van der Rohe. His obsession with the Modernist tradition led him to defend it after it became passe and the public pronounced it dead. He suggested that not only did students need to survive the Modern movement, but embrace it as history. He also felt that the Cubist and De Stijl painters had similar perceptions of the continuity of space and drew inspiration from them. He commented profusely on the Modernist concept of continuous space in both writings and lectures regarding his three protagonists as well as many others. He used Modernism as a source of history and theory for his lessons. \\"First\\", it is written of his changes in the ETH, \\"it was decided what should be taught. Then, from this, situations and programmes were formulated. The student sees himself confronted by a problem. He deals with it, makes his own experiences, and on the basis of a review of the theme in the lecture and discussion, it is possible for him, at the same time, to understand what he has experienced.\\"Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Z√ºrich, 1989. p. 67 The Basic Design course Hoesli began his curriculum overhaul with the basic design course. In his opinion, \\"the basic course should allow for the architecturally still \\"unskilled\\" people to recognize: what an architectural idea is; how it results, how it can be drawn out; upon what it is based; and how it can be developed, treated.\\"Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Z√ºrich, 1989. p. 27 This theory was put into action with several design exercises. One in the first semester involved extensive writing on the subject of the design concurrent with its first conceived sketches. This project involved first describing the everyday functions of the space to be designed, along with space requirements and basic diagrams. This was based on Hoesli's obsession with space. He stated as the first point of knowledge for architects, \\"The architect creates space.\\"Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Z√ºrich, 1989. p. 52 The students for this project started with a vague concept and explored avenues through which to improve their ideas as each step progressed. The openness of this first design step allowed for much more learning than the previous structure, as students were not as conceptually attached to a particular building before all the kinks in its design had been resolved. In short, \\"the first spatial organization is tested against the requirements and developed further‚Ä¶. The design is, above all, a spatial organization.\\" Hoesli taught new definitions of space as a continuous function. One key project in the first semester demonstrating this concept was called 'space within space.' Students were to design a space that was \\"defined without indicating and above or below.\\"Jansen et al. Architektur Lehren. Institut gta, Z√ºrich, 1989. p. 28 The point of this exercise was to separate function from design; a surface or a defining of space was not necessarily a floor or a ceiling or a wall- those titles are added by people. He based this assignment off a quote by Le Corbusier that includes the phrase \\"the floor that is a horizontal wall.\\" This exercise, similar to the way many sculpture classes are taught, required that the finished product be equally viable from all sides. It could not contain a top or bottom or any other defining characteristic. This project, with so few but such stringent guidelines, challenged students to think about space in a different way. They also considered their materials in different ways, as many students attempted this exercise with many different media. They then faced the task of refining their materials to match their ideas or vice versa, another key concept Hoesli aimed for. The project also encouraged a great variety in creativity as students sought to execute the concept as thoroughly as possible. Students were encouraged to complete as much of the first step as possible independently in order to allow this creativity. In the second phase of this problem, which happened in the winter semester, students worked with advising groups together. They continued this exploration, defining the space within the space. They put the space they had created into another space, a cube, giving it a context of reference. Hoesli enforced his concept of 'geometry as image' during these space- exploring assignments. This, along with his preoccupation with collaging of materials in a geometric manner, was clearly communicated to the students based on their final products. Another assignment during the first semester was the 'Extension to a House' project. Hoesli was interested in communicating that not every architectural creation needed to be a freestanding object, but that architecture involved working with the space that already existed- be it an empty lot or a pre-existing structure. In this project, the students followed three concise steps. They first analyzed the existing structure, generally a home built by one of Hoesli's Texas Ranger friends. They analyzed both form and function of every part of the existing building, strengthening skills in drawing as well as proportion and geometry. They next did sketches and ideas for their proposed solutions to the problem and worked through these with help from faculty. They discussed the pros and cons of each idea they had before deciding on a final plan. The third step was actual work on the project, including material decision-making and discussions on how to integrate the new addition into the old structure both aesthetically and physically. This assignment also reinforced Hoesli's idea of working in steps and allowing revising to take a role in the creative process. During the second year, students had the clubhouse assignment. They were to create a set of buildings- a clubhouse, an airplane hangar, and a workshop that worked together as a group without necessarily touching. The intent of this exercise was to teach yet more process, involving organization, site evaluation, architectural themes, construction and form, as well as practical presentation skills. Another second-year project was known as the pottery. Students were faced with a much more difficult space to address: one in an existing urban environment. This meant that street space and a house on the lot would interact significantly with the structure they designed, including even a common courtyard-type exchange between the two structures. The location as well as function was specified for students: the building was to be a pottery business, including a shop and a studio. The process again went through many steps and revisions in order to reach its final outcome. Career changes In 1969, Hoesli was appointed Chairman of the architecture school. Unfortunately for him, this coincided with some serious political unrest both in Switzerland as a whole and within the university. He had a very difficult time adapting to the changes within the student body and their demeanor. His old methods of teaching from Texas and his prior ETH career didn't seem to work with the skeptical new generation. At this point, Hoesli realized he'd rather spend time working with students in the higher level classes who had already decided on their goals as architects. He left his first year courses in the same design and focused on the later year studios. He, along with Paul Hofer and Adolph Max Vogt, founded the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture within the ETH and pronounced himself director. This allowed him to work with only the most elite students. After Hoesli questioned the third and fourth year design class practices he‚Äôd seen from other faculty, he made the decision to teach the third year design course with Paul Hofer. After the two collaborated on the course curriculum for that first year (1978/1979) Hoesli took over the design course. The course for the third and fourth year was not divided into semester work, but rather consisted of a single project for those years. This project, called the Venice Project, was a housing unit for an urban setting, specifically the Cannaregio district in Venice, and contained six sections in its program. The Venice project The first step discussed the idea of a city as a working unit. In this step, students worked in clay to create massing models in order to understand the various interactions within volumetric shapes. They also attended related lectures. In the next step students analyzed different types of dwellings. Criteria for this analysis include size, layout in space, variation options, and so on. They refine the ideas in the clay designs they created. The third step, related to the second, deals with using the analyses of step two in order to create a structure that relates to the architecture around it. The knowledge of the architecture of the area informs the ideas students originally had and gives more structure to their ideas. Natural lighting becomes a factor. The students learned about a typical layout in a Venetian town, including even the piazza with the church, and altered their designs accordingly. The fourth step refers specifically to the student's design and the important relationship between the inside and outside of the building. Students decide on a theme for their final designs as they address the transition from inside to outside space. This relates back to the very first assignment regarding the shaping and defining of space- continuous space rather than an inside versus an outside. The next step seems quite difficult. Students must turn their ideas of spatial understandings for their plans into volumetric shapes; i.e. they must turn volume into mass. They did, in essence, a figure-ground reversal. This served to ensure that every space in the final design was active and engaging. Hoesli used as a basis for this step the common observation that it seems Le Corbusier's Unite is a volumetric explanation for the space in the Uffizi. The final step was to design the scale models of their housing project, involving all the previous steps in their final designs. What is considered the seventh step in the process is actually the selection of a new project for the following semesters. The students work together with faculty juries in order to select the goals for this project. The project is chosen as a general urban section that each student can contribute to in an individualized manner. They divide up sections of the area and provide solutions to the individual problems they present themselves with. In this way, students were able to become fully involved in the process while retaining a respect for a larger picture. During the designing process, students were presented with lectures and instruction on common Venetian facades and asked to incorporate this information into their designs. This consisted the eighth step. The ninth step was the final submission of the design. The obsession with space and transparency continued throughout Hoesli's teaching career. He commented, \\"Transparency arises wherever there are locations in space which can be assigned two or more systems of reference‚Äîwhere the classification is undefined and the choice between one classification possibility or another remains open.\\" Hoesli, Bernhard. \\"Commentary.\\" Rowe, Colin and Slutzky, Robert.

Each group has two soloists and a drone group, which provides and maintains the vocal rhythm of the song.

The first soloist performs the beginning of the song (, ), and literally acts as the narrator and leader of the group, singing the main part of the song. The second soloist (or the turner) () answers (or \\"turns\\") the voice ( (yirizei, turns) or \\"œÑœÉŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπ\\" (tsakizei, crimps) ). Sometimes, instead of the \\"turner\\", or according to some musicologists parallel with it, we find the role of the spinner ( (klostis, spinner), ). The \\"spinner\\" spins the song between the tonic and subtonic of the melody, a technique that reminds the movement of the hand which holds the spindle and spins the thread. This is a role that is often, but not always, found is the one of \\"rihtis\\", who drops () the song in the end of the introduction of \\"partis\\", by singing an exclamation (e.g. (ah oh oh) or, \\"Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒµ Œ≤œÅŒµ\\" (ante vre)), which is a fourth lower than the tonic of the melody, resting \\"partis\\" and uniting its introduction with the entrance of the drone group. The drone group is composed by the rest of the members of the polyphonic group and is also called iso keepers group (, (isokrates, iso keepers) ,European voices: Multipart singing in the Balkans and the ..., Volume 1 By Ardian Ahmedaja, Gerlinde Haid page 211 and ), from the Greek Isocrates \\"ŒπœÉŒøŒ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ\\" and that from the Medieval Greek \\"ŒπœÉŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑœéŒΩ\\" (isokraton),Takis Kalogeropoulos, Lexicon of the Greek Music, 2001, \\"one who holds the ison\\", the note that holds on the whole length of a song, from Ancient Greek \\"·º¥œÉŒøœÇ\\" (isos) generally meaning \\"equal\\" but here \\"equal in flight of song\\"·º¥œÉŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library \\\\+ \\"Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒ≠œâ\\" (krateo) \\"to rule, to hold\\".Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒ≠œâ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library The words ison and isos literally mean the continuous base notePsaltic Chant, Monast√®re de la Th√©otokos et de Saint martin and isocrates creates and holds the modal base of the song. The isokrates role is particularly important; the louder the keeping of the vocal drone, (), the more \\"Œ≤œÅŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÅŒπŒ¨\\" (vrontaria) (i.e. better) the song goes, because the rhythm and the vocal base of the song are maintained. The term derives from the Byzantine Greek musical tradition, where the \\"ŒØœÉŒøŒΩ\\" also features. The perfection of the rendition of the polyphonic song presupposes the existence and the unity of the several voices‚Äìroles of the polyphonic group. As a result, polyphonic song presupposes the collectiveness of expression and the firm distinction between the roles it reflects, and the unwritten hierarchy in the composition of the group and the distribution of the roles.

The primary visual difference is that the VS-50 usually features a black rubber pressure plate (TS-50's pressure plate is usually body colored, and is stamped TS-50) but the key identifier is the horizontal indexing tabs off the vertical fins visible in the left and far right side of the mine in the picture. The TS-50 is a diameter circular Italian blast resistant minimum metal anti-personnel mine designed and produced by Valsella Meccanotecnica. Description The mine has a ribbed plastic case which is olive green, brown or sand colored. The mine has a central raised pressure pad on the top surface of the mine, but is designed to operate even with the mine upside down. Pressure on the mine forces air through a diaphragm into a small rubber air bag, which inflates. As the bag inflates it pushes a shutter, which in turn removes the striker retaining lug. The striker is free to impact the detonator. The mine requires a constant pressure of approximately 2 to 5 kg (5 to 11 lbs) for an average of 0.11 seconds before the fuze will detonate. This allows the mine to be laid in a high density pattern without the shock of a detonation impacting the nearby mines. The design of the TS-50's fuze gives it a large degree of resistance to explosive overpressure clearance techniques, because the short sharp shock from an explosion does not last long enough to force enough air into the air bag to trigger the mine. This feature, combined with the use of non-magnetic metals used in the mine, make it difficult to clear using conventional techniques. A metal \\"detector\\" disc is provided with the mine to make it more detectable, however it is rarely used. Additionally, the mine is waterproof and can be used in shallow water. The mine can be either laid by hand or scattered by helicopter from the DAT mine dispenser system. Production The mine was originally produced by Tecnovar italiana SpA, and was in service with the Italian army. When the anti-personnel mine ban came into force the Italian army destroyed all its stocks of the mine. It is very similar to another Italian mine, the VS-50. TS-50 mines were widely exported and also were produced under license in Egypt.

Its name is derived from the Welsh word coed (\\"wood\\") and the word talwrn, anglicised to \\"Talon\\", meaning a \\"hillside devoid of trees\\" or \\"threshing-floor\\" (perhaps referring to a wood beneath a bare hillside).Davies, E. Flintshire place-names, University of Wales Press, 1959, p.38  History  The area, about four miles from the market town of Mold, was primarily agricultural until the nineteenth century, when following the discovery of coal and iron ore seams, an ironworks and a series of collieries were opened. In 1892, a bed of fireclay was discovered and a brickworks was subsequently opened. There was also a silica quarry nearby at Waun y Llyn. The industries were served by a branch of the London and North Western Railway, who in 1892 introduced a passenger service to Coed Talon, running over part of the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway to Brymbo in Denbighshire.Coed Talon, Disused Stations The station closed in 1950 and the line to Brymbo was taken out of use shortly afterwards, though goods trains from Mold continued until 1963.

The railway ran from Cambridge in the south, through Fenland countryside to the market town of St Ives; more specifically, the line ran from Chesterton Junction, where it met the present- day Fen line north of the River Cam. Passenger services along the line managed to survive the Beeching Axe, but with British Rail citing heavy losses the final passenger service ran between St Ives and Cambridge on 5 October 1970. Despite campaigns to reopen the service during the 1970s, the only subsequent rail traffic on the line was a freight service to Chivers in Histon which ran until 1983 and a contract to ferry sand from ARC at Fen Drayton which continued until May 1992.

Paspaley claims that it is a strong advocate of environmental responsibility within the pearling industry. The Paspaley Group has a diversified portfolio of investments including a naval fleet, aircraft, a shopping mall, an office block, agriculture properties, resorts, and a vineyard. Members of the Paspaley family had an interest in Australia's largest immigration detention centre, located south of Darwin, Northern Territory. Paspaley Pearls According to Paspaley, its pearls are particularly known for their 'orient', which is the combination of transparent lustre and unique play of colours which is exhibited by pearls with fine quality Paspaley operates 20 pearl farms dotted along the coastline of north- Western Australia. Paspaley claims that it maintains a ‚Äòleave no trace‚Äô environmental policy. In 2012, the area in which Paspaley operates was designated as a marine wilderness sanctuary. Paspaley stated that this area was still in pristine condition and is a breeding ground for humpback whales. Paspaley Pearls appear in the collections of Tiffany & Co, Cartier, Harry Winston, Chow Tai Fook, Falconer, and more. In 1992 a single Paspaley strand of 23 pearls set a world record for cultured pearls when it was auctioned for 2.3 million at Sotheby's, New York. = Retail and wholesale = Paspaley operate nine retail stores globally, with a strong presence in Australia ‚Äì most recently in Crown ‚Äì Melbourne, Australia; as well as the UAE. In addition to the retail stores, Paspaley also operates the Paspaley e-boutique. Paspaley Pearling Company is the pearling wholesale department of the Paspaley Group of Companies. This department sells Paspaley Australian South Sea pearls to a variety of jewellery brands as well as independent retailers. History =Early history= Paspaley was established by the Paspalis family, who migrated from Greece to Australia in 1919. The family settled in Cossack, Western Australia. At that time, the Australian north coast was the world's most important pearling area, with the towns of Broome, Western Australia, Cossack, and Darwin being the world's leading pearling ports. The Paspalis family were among the few Europeans living in the area with Aboriginal inhabitants and Asian pearl fishermen. Pearling was one of the few viable industries in the area, and Theodosis Paspalis with the help of his family, built a pearling fleet that became the basis of the family company. Nicholas Paspaley joined the pearling trade at 14 years of age. By 1932, at the age of 19, he ran his own pearling lugger, diving for natural pearls, and for mother- of-pearl shell. When Port Hedland began to become less profitable due to exhaustion of the pearl fields, Paspaley made the decision to move to the uncharted waters of Darwin. In Darwin, Paspaley increased his pearling fleet to 5 pearling ships. It was in Darwin that Nicholas Paspalis changed the family name to Paspaley, and established the Paspaley Pearling Company. At the outbreak of World War II, the Australian government impounded and then destroyed all pearling luggers in North Australia to keep them away from Japanese invaders. =Post World War II= After WWII the Japanese Akoya pearl industry was rebuilt in Japan, and exports of Japanese Akoya Cultured pearls boomed to international markets. Similarly, post World War II, the Australian mother-of-pearl shell industry also boomed as renewed demand ensured record prices for mother-of-pearl buttons right through to the mid-1950s. Nicholas Paspaley had purchased four luggers which had been abandoned during the war by the Royal Australian Navy on Darwin's beaches. Once again, after rebuilding the luggers, Nicholas resumed pearling out of Darwin. However, the invention of the plastic button in the mid 1950s reduced demand for mother-of-pearl shell, virtually devastating the industry overnight, with the fleets of pearling luggers abandoned once more on the beaches. Not to be defeated by this sudden collapse of the industry, Nicholas drew inspiration from the success of the booming Japanese Akoya cultured pearl industry, and sought to resurrect the South Sea pearl project commenced by Baron Iwasaki in 1916 ‚Äì this time taking advantage of North Australia's abundant and superior beds of South Sea pearl oysters ‚Äì with the dream to cultivate the world's largest and most valuable cultured pearl ‚Äì the cultured South Sea pearl. In the early 1950s Nicholas negotiated a joint venture project with the Kuribayashi family of Japan ‚Äì employing the Iwasaki/Mitsubishi experts who had pioneered the project before the war. Although the Kuribayashi's had no pearl farming experience, the Kuribayashi family were the owners of the Japanese pearling fleet that travelled from Japan each year, diving for mother-of-pearl shell and pearls off the North Australian coast. Their experience in the pearling industry made them a suitable partner for the project. The Australian Government subsequently removed the ban on pearl culture activities in Australia, and authorised the establishment of the first two pearl farms in Australia. One at Kuri Bay (named after Kuribayashi), and one at Port Essington. Initially, the Kuri Bay project was controlled by the Kuribayashi family, and the Port Essington project was controlled by Paspaley Pearling Company. Ultimately ‚Äì In 1989, under the stewardship of Nick Paspaley Jnr., the two projects were merged under the Paspaley Pearling Company banner. During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the Australia pearl farms operated with virtually the same pre-WWII Iwasaki/Mitsubishi technology. Pearl production flourished and increased steadily annually. Cultured South Sea pearls became known simply as \\"South Sea pearls\\". They dominated pearl jewellery markets worldwide, and established a distinct \\"premier\\" category of cultured pearls ‚Äì the \\"South Sea Pearl\\". These pearls had the effect of resurrected the existence once more of important pearl jewellery in leading jewellery houses around the world. South Sea pearl prices were hundreds of times higher than the Japanese Akoya cultured pearl prices. Nicholas Paspaley had lived to realise his dream of creating cultured pearls of the same quality as his natural South Sea pearls ‚Äì the most beautiful and most valuable of the \\"old world\\" pearls. In 1982 Nicholas Paspaley was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the pearling industry, to business and to community service. He was also awarded a Paul Harris Fellowship for his services to the community through Rotary International. Nicholas Paspaley lived the romantic life of a true adventurer and pioneer. He dedicated his whole life to the pearling industry in the remoteness of North Australia. He died in 1984. Nicholas's wife Vivienne Lavinia Paspaley (1913‚Äì2003) worked with her husband to build the Paspaley Pearling Company and was also a significant figure in the social development of Darwin. Nick Paspaley Jnr joined the Paspaley Pearling Company in 1969 after graduating from Sydney University as a Bachelor of Economics. Nick worked with his father eventually pioneering modern pearl cultivating techniques that enabled the realisation of his father's vision. In 1999 Nick Paspaley Jnr was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia for his services to Australia's export industry. Nick Paspaley Jnr was instrumental in the establishment of the South Sea Pearl Consortium ‚Äì the non-profit organisation committed to promoting and protecting the reputation of the South Sea pearl. Nick is a Board member of CIBJO ‚Äì The World Jewelry Federation whose charter is the promotion of ethics and responsibility in the jewellery industry for the protection of consumers, and to foster confidence in the jewellery industry. Management and structure  Paspaley Pearls is a family-run and -owned business, with offices in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and the UAE.

Accident  On April 19, 2000, Flight 541, with 131 passengers and crew, left Manila at about 5:30 AM, bound for Davao City. At Around 7 AM the Boeing was approaching runway 05 following an Airbus 319. When Flight 541 broke free from the clouds the crew observed that the A319 had not yet cleared the runway at which time they advised ATC a missed approach procedure would be performed. Flight 541 began to climb and re-entered the clouds. The correct procedure would have been to climb to 4,000 feet on instruments and circle around to pick up the guide slope. Instead the crew attempted to fly VFR in instrument conditions at a lower altitude. Flight 541 contacted a coconut tree about 500 feet above sea level, and crashed a few miles west of the airport. The plane subsequently caught fire and disintegrated; there were no survivors.  Aftermath  Villagers on the island said the plane was flying at low altitude and hit the top of a coconut tree, which knocked off part of its wing. They said it appeared the plane tried to pull up under full engine power, but failed and crashed. The plane disintegrated and caught fire when it came down in a coconut grove. Airport officials said skies were foggy at the time of the accident. Davao International Airport did not have full equipment for instrument landings, and visual landings had been suspended several minutes before the crash.

He was the third highest-scoring U-boat commander of the war, and was awarded the Pour le M√©rite for his achievements. He was also listed as a war criminal by the Allies, for killing hundreds of civilians by sinking the passenger liner without warning on December 30, 1915, contrary to international law. Early life The eldest of the four children of Otto Friedrich Valentiner and Mathilde Julie Valentiner, Valentiner was born in Tondern (T√∏nder), Province of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1882, the family moved to Ketting on Als where his father held a job as a priest for two years, then moving to Sonderburg (S√∏nderborg). Valentiner started his time in school in Ketting, then Augustenburg (Augustenborg) and later in Sonderburg on Reimers school. Pre- war military service At the age of 18, he joined the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire on April 1, 1902, as a Seekadett on the school ship .SMS Moltke was later renamed SMS Acheron on October 28, 1911. A battlecruiser launched in 1910 was also named SMS Moltke, see for more details. On August 15, 1902, he saved a ship's boy from drowning in Swinem√ºnde's harbor, and received his first of many decorations, the Rettungsmedaille (life-saving medal). In 1903, Valentiner joined the naval school where he attended many courses, especially in diving, his preferred topic. He ended his training on the . On May 14, 1903, he saved an able seaman in Heligoland harbour from the waves and certain death, and was awarded the Order of the Crown Medal for his courage and valour in action. On September 29, 1905, he was promoted to Leutnant zur See and in 1907 he became an officer on . He was promoted again on March 30, 1908, to Oberleutnant zur See. From 1908 to 1910, Valentiner was company commander for 1. Matrosen-Artillerie-Abteilung in Kiel. In 1911, Valentiner became an officer on the U-boat salvage ship . In this job, on January 17, 1911, he saved all 30 men of by getting them out via a torpedo tube after it sank in Kiel Harbour due to an unclosed valve in the ventilation shaft. Among the saved crew was Otto Weddigen, later the commander of , and Paul Clarrendorf, the commander of U-boot-Abnahme-Kommando in Kiel which enlisted U-boat crews. Valentiner received the Order of the Crown 4th class for the life-saving mission. On July 1, 1911, Valentiner took command of the new U-boat . On board he showed incredible skill and boldness and on training manoeuvres he sank several ships with drill torpedoes without ever being sighted. His performance literally changed the German vision of U-boat warfare. On March 22, 1914, Valentiner was promoted to Kapit√§nleutnant and nine days later he became a teacher at the U-boat school in Kiel, a position he held until the outbreak of World War I on August 4, 1914, when the United Kingdom declared war on the German Empire. World War I When World War I broke out, Valentiner took command of , the U-boat on which he three years earlier saved 30 men from dying. His orders were to sink Russian warships in the Baltic Sea, but he failed, and blamed the old U-boat which did not have the capabilities of the newer boats in the Kaiserliche Marine. Valentiner returned to base without any successes and was relieved from his command on October 27, 1914. He was sent to Berlin to face Prince Heinrich and explain the problems with the older U-boats. The prince was furious and sent him away. When Valentiner returned to Kiel he was quite surprised to learn that he was to take command of the newest U-boat, . He was also allowed to choose his own officers from the U-boat school. From December 5, 1914, to September 15, 1917, Valentiner was stationed by 2. U-Halbflottille/U-Flottille Pola at the Austrian base of Cattaro, in Montenegro. All German U-boat activities in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took place from here. Until the end of March 1915, U-38 had several problems with its diesel engine, and repairs were required. Training of the new crew took place between repairs near the British east coast, which were considered the most safe and simple for training. After March, U-38 started to patrol in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and on December 30, 1915, U-38 and Valentiner sank the British passenger ship without any warning. Of the 519 aboard, 343 perished. The action was highly controversial since it broke naval international law and the Rules of Prize Warfare. The action took place under Germany‚Äôs policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, but broke the Imperial German Navy‚Äôs own restriction on attacking passenger liners, the Arabic pledge. After the attack, Valentiner was placed on the Allies list of war criminals. At home, he was awarded with the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern on May 14, 1916. On December 3, 1916, Valentiner took U-38 into the Funchal harbor on Madeira and sank three enemy ships. For this accomplishment, he became the sixth U-boat commander awarded the Pour le M√©rite, on December 26. On September 15, 1917, Valentiner left U-38 and Cattaro and returned to Kiel to take command of the new . Kapit√§nleutnant Rabe von Pappenhein was to have taken this command, but for unknown reasons, this was changed. With U-157, Valentiner undertook the longest cruise of the war, from November 27, 1917, to April 15, 1918, a total of 139 days. This cruise came to be his last. In total, he sank 150 ships with a tonnage of about 300,000 tons. Valentiner returned to the U-boat school to teach new submariners his techniques. His experience and advice were taken into account in the construction of the new boat U-143, which was faster and had a much improved dive time, but it was never finished. Interbellum Valentiner was accused of \\"cruel and inhuman treatment of crews\\" in fifteen different incidents involving French, British, and Italian ships. The Allies demanded all war criminals be extradited, but most simply resigned quietly and disappeared for a while, including Valentiner. He went first to Berlin, was deleted from the list of naval officers, and acquired a new passport under the name Carl Schmidt. Valentiner then traveled to East Prussia and lived at Kadinen, an estate that his father managed, where he waited for the extraditions to proceed. He eventually became impatient and returned to Kiel. The peace negotiations were eventually completed, and per the Treaty of Versailles, all U-boats were dismantled. On his promotion to Korvettenkapit√§n, Valentiner was relieved of duty. The German Navy had argued that the Royal Navy's use of Q-ships and false flag attacks had changed the nature of the war, making it impossible for German submarines to surface and give a targeted ship the chance to surrender. Valentiner started a small company in Kiel, trading engines and parts. He later became a shipowner, and also worked for both Dr√§gerwerke (diving equipment) in L√ºbeck and Adeltwerke in Eberswalde, northwest of Berlin. World War II In January 1940, Valentiner was appointed group commander for U-Boots-Abnahmekommission (UAK) in Kiel-Danzig, a position he held until March 1945. Meanwhile, on January 1, 1941, he was promoted to Kapit√§n zur See. On March 31, 1945, he was discharged from the Kriegsmarine. Last years On June 19, 1949, Valentiner died in S√∏nderborg hospital from lung disease, likely precipitated by the inhalation of toxic vapors from the engines in his first U-boats, U-10 and U-3.

The company's headquarters and main production plant are in Via Santa Barbara in Lecco, Italy. History Fiocchi Munizioni was founded on 3 July 1876 in Lecco, Italy, by accountant Giulio Fiocchi. In 1876, Giulio Fiocchi took over the ammunition production part of a weapon and ammunition company already based in Lecco, which produced small-caliber ammunition. A Fiocchi cal. 12 gauge. At that time a radical change was introduced in firearms: the newly developed breech-loader replaced the traditional muzzle loader. Fiocchi started manufacturing cases with primers suitable for reloading; in the early 1890s production was extended to complete cartridges loaded with bullets or shot. At the same time, Fiocchi gave up the production of black powder, as it was no longer profitable. At the beginning of the 20th century, Fiocchi diversified and began making snap fasteners using scraps from cartridge production. Fiocchi Snaps was formed in 1903. It assumed an important role to counterbalance the trend of the ammunition market, but at the end of the 1980s Fiocchi made a decision to focus on ammunition as its core business, and the snaps factory was sold. During its long life, Fiocchi has manufactured all kinds of ammunition from pinfire, shotshells, and cartridges to all kinds of cartridges and cases, both rimfire and centerfire. They are known for manufacturing rarer cartridges for collectors and enthusiasts, for example the .455 Webley.

Its presence and production sites are also in the United States and in Hungary. In 2008 Fiocchi UK was opened in Great Britain. According to a recent interview with Carlo Fiocchi, the head of Fiocchi America, more than 75% of the ammunition sold by Fiocchi in the United States is also manufactured in the United States at Fiocchi America's production facility in Ozark, Missouri.Carlo Fiocchi Interview Specifically, Fiocchi America's composition of U.S. ammo manufacturing and sales according to the interview is as follows: *95% of the center-fire rifle ammunition, which accounts for ~15% of Fiocchi‚Äôs U.S. sales *75% of center- fire pistol ammunition, which accounts for ~35% of Fiocchi‚Äôs U.S. sales *100% of shotshells, which accounts for ~35% of Fiocchi‚Äôs U.S. sales *0% of rimfire ammunition, which account for ~15% of Fiocchi‚Äôs U.S. sales (along with components) Qualifications and Certifications of prestige attest the level of quality achieved by the company: *NATO AQAP-110 Certification *ISO 14001: 1996 Certification of the Environment Management System *UNI EN ISO 9001: 2000 Certification of the Quality Management System. Furthermore, Fiocchi shooting cartridges have contributed to several World Cups and Olympic triumphs, as the Games in Athens in 2004 as well as in those in Beijing in 2008. In 2011 newly developed 12GA shot shells filled with chemical tracer Cyalume in which allows the shooter to see where the shots are going and will greatly help in the training of sporting clays. The tracer shots are non-toxic and biodegradable and packaged in a sealed metal can in Fiocchi's line of Canned Heat ammunition. The Canned Heat line of ammunition allows a greater shelf life and maintaining quality of the ammo throughout shipping, retail shelf, and consumer handling. Fiocchi Munizioni is still entirely owned by private capital heading to the Fiocchi Family.  Fiocchi of America  In partnership with Smith & Wesson, the Fiocchi family had a factory in Alton, Illinois, in the 1950s. Diverging company interests caused Fiocchi to sell its share to Smith & Wesson and withdraw from the American market. Great grandson Carlo Fiocchi joined the family business in 1980 at the age of 24 and worked as a product manager in charge of the English-speaking market, his assignment no doubt influenced by the fact that his grandmother was British. His responsibilities included overseeing its meager exports to the United States. Carlo traveled to the United States on his honeymoon, with instructions to bring back marketing research for a US facility. Carlo concluded that opportunities could not be exploited unless Fiocchi had a physical presence. In 1983, a FOA facility was built in Springfield, Missouri, to import ammunition, the location selected because of his father‚Äôs existing contacts there and that it offered the most favorable rail and trucking costs. After a year and a half they realized that importing loaded ammunition was not an effective business model. The company couldn‚Äôt react fast enough to the needs of the US shooters. Carlo returned to Italy and convinced the president, Paolo, to build a manufacturing plant on a farm he identified in the Ozarks near Springfield. Fiocchi negotiated a purchase with the farmer and loans with the bank. Providing a platform for quality manufacturing jobs, the Fiocchi enterprise was enthusiastically welcomed by the local government. Nevertheless, in 2005, Pietro, Carlo and Donna Swafford, chief operations manager, boldly attempted to revitalize the company in April 2005. Due in large measure to their acumen, since then FOA sales have increased 500%. The US subsidiary imports empty primed hulls from Fiocchi Munizioni and wads from Italy, produced mainly by Baschieri & Pellagri and Gualandi in Bologna, a world capital of machine shop engineering, home to Ferrari, Lamborghini and Ducati - and the ancestral home of the Fiocchi family.

Although the presence of Rhodes and Blythe made higher representative honours always out of his reach, for a couple of years in the early 1900s Hargreave was regarded as the best left arm slow bowler in England apart from Rhodes.Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack; Fortieth edition (1903); p. 113 His accuracy was always exceptional and on helpful pitches he could spin the ball a great deal. Being faster than Rhodes or Blythe, Hargreave was very difficult to hit and his steadiness made him valuable on the generally very plumb wickets that characterised Edgbaston in fine weather during that era. Hargreave was no batsman, but he was a capable fieldsman at point. Sam Hargreave played for Lancashire's second eleven in the middle 1890s, but having no opportunity with Briggs so dominant he left the country to qualify for Warwickshire.Caine, C. Stewart (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack; Sixty-Seventh edition (1930); part i, p. 252 He first played for Warwickshire in two matches at the tail end of 1899, and did nothing apart from a surprise 44 against Lockwood at his most destructive, which was to remain his second-highest score in first- class cricket. However, he rose very quickly to a permanent place in 1900, and in the following year, in a summer all against bowlers especially on so good a ground as Edgbaston provided in fine weather, Hargreave bowled so well under all conditions that he was in the top ten of the first-class averages. On a helpful pitch Hargreave already showed how difficult he could be with such performances as seven for 50 at Worcester and fourteen for 115 against London County, but he bowled beautifully under all conditions. In the following two seasons, almost continuously helped by the condition of the pitches, Hargreave went from strength to strength except when mastered completely on perfect pitches against Derbyshire and Surrey in August 1902. It was thought his relatively slight frame could not cope with the heavy workload he had to carry on hard wickets, but Hargreave had his revenge on a sticky Oval wicket the following year, when in the best-known (and biggest) feat of his career he took fifteen for 76 after being initially left out after returning from a tour to New Zealand. Because the first day was blank Hargreave could take his place in the Warwickshire team, and for that year every Warwickshire victory was related to Hargreave's deadly bowling on rain affected pitches: * v Surrey at The Oval: six for 41 and nine for 35 ** TOTAL 15 wickets for 76 runs * v Leicestershire at Edgbaston: six for 30 and six for 49 ** TOTAL 12 wickets for 79 runs * v Essex at Edgbaston: five for 51 and six for 29 ** TOTAL 11 wickets for 80 runs * v Gloucestershire at Bristol: five for 71 and three for 40 ** TOTAL eight wickets for 111 runs * v Hampshire at Edgbaston: five for 65 and seven for 48 ** TOTAL 12 wickets for 113 runs * GRAND TOTAL for five wins: 58 wickets for 461 runs, average 7.95 Heading the County Championship bowling averages (at least among those who bowled a reasonable number of overs) and taking more first-class wickets than anybody except Rhodes, Blythe and Ted Arnold, Hargreave would ordinarily have been chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden, but the choices of Blythe, John Gunn and Walter Mead left no room for a fourth finger-spin bowler. However, questions about Hargreave's physical strength re-emerged when in the dry summer of 1904 he was quite out of form,Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack; Forty- second edition (1905); p. 131 taking only half as many wickets as in 1903 at over twice the cost. However, for the two following years he defied his critics with his tenacity and patience on generally very easy pitches: doing, in the continued absence of Field, a great deal of work on unhelpful pitches, he remained one of the best left-arm spinners in the business.Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack; Forty-fourth edition (1907); p. 108 This work, however, took its toll in 1907 when the wickets should have allowed him as good an average as 1903, but Hargreave could no longer spin the ball and averaged as much as 22 runs a wicket for little more than half as many victims as in 1903. In the following year he was often left out of the team and an appalling record of over 30 runs per wicket in the wet summer of 1909 showed Hargreave to be completely past it. Warwickshire did not offer him a contract for 1910. Always affected by ill-health for the rest of his life, Sam Hargreave died, largely unnoticed, on the first day of 1929. At the time of his death, Hargreave still was the third-highest wicket-taker for Warwickshire behind Field and Howell. Among slow bowlers, only Paine and Hollies have exceeded his tally.

Gaitonde (V. S. Gaitonde) (1924‚Äì2001) was regarded as one of India's foremost abstract painters. He received Padma Shri Award in 1971. Early life and education Gaitonde was born in 1924, in Nagpur, Maharashtra, to Goan parents. He completed his art diploma at Sir J. J. School of Art in 1948, and in 1950 was invited to join the influential Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. Career Impressed by his work, Vasudev was invited to join the Progressive Artists Group of Bombay formed in 1947 by artists like Francis Newton Souza and S. H. Raza and Maqbool Fida Husain. He actively participated in the activities of the group. He had several exhibitions held in India as well as in foreign countries. In 1956, he participated in the Indian art exhibition, which was held in Eastern European countries. He also participated in other group exhibitions held at the Graham Art Gallery, New York, in 1959 and 1963. Gaitonde's abstract works are produced in many Indian and overseas collections including the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1957, he was awarded the first prize at the Young Asian Artists Exhibition, Tokyo and the Rockefeller Fellowship followed in 1964. In 1971, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. He lived and worked in Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, and died in 2001, in obscurity. Style ‚Ä≥A quiet man and a painter of the quiet reaches of the imagination\\" as one of his admirers once called him, defines Gaitonde best, who has the appearance of an intellectual, literally simmering with some unexplored thought. Conceptually, he never considered himself an abstract painter and is averse to be called one. In fact he asserts that there is no such thing as abstract painting, instead he refers to his work as \\"non- objective\\" a kind of personalised hieroglyphics and calligraphic inventions, evoking the surface painted on with the most astounding intuitions, which he has realised in his inevitable meeting, in discovering Zen. The meditative Zen quality that transpires his speech, emoting silence is exemplified in his work best, as silence is eternal and meaningful in itself, from this point one does tend to identify the mysterious motifs, the highly personalised hieroglyphs in Gaitonde's canvasses with the manifestation of intuitions, invested in their His work is influenced by Zen philosophy and ancient calligraphy. Legacy V. S. Gaitonde was the first Indian contemporary painter whose work was sold for at a 2005 Osians art auction in Mumbai. In 2013, one of Gaitonde's untitled painting sold for , set a record for an Indian artist at Christie's debut auction in India.

Campbell, a psychologist and social scientist who often wrote about research methodology, which states: > \\"The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision- > making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt > it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to > monitor.\\" Applications Campbell's law can be seen as an example of the cobra effect, which is the sometimes unintended negative effect of public policy and other government interventions in economics, commerce, and healthcare. =Education= In 1976, Campbell wrote: \\"Achievement tests may well be valuable indicators of general school achievement under conditions of normal teaching aimed at general competence. But when test scores become the goal of the teaching process, they both lose their value as indicators of educational status and distort the educational process in undesirable ways. (Similar biases of course surround the use of objective tests in courses or as entrance examinations.)\\" The social science principle of Campbell's law is used to point out the negative consequences of high-stakes testing in U.S. classrooms. This may take the form of teaching to the test or outright cheating. \\"The High-Stakes Education Rule\\" is identified and analyzed in the book \\"Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us\\". Campbell‚Äôs Law helps people discern that the Obama administration program of Race to the Top and Bush administration program, the No Child Left Behind Act can actually impair, not improve, educational outcome.  Similar rules  There are closely related ideas known by different names, such as Goodhart's law and the Lucas critique. Another concept related to Campbell's law emerged in 2006 when UK researchers Rebecca Boden and Debbie Epstein published an analysis of evidence-based policy, a practice espoused by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the paper, Boden and Epstein described how a government that tries to base its policy on evidence can actually end up producing corrupted data because it \\"seeks to capture and control the knowledge producing processes to the point where this type of 'research' might best be described as 'policy-based evidence'.\\" When someone distorts decisions in order to improve the performance measure, they often surrogate, coming to believe that the measure is a better measure of true performance than it really is. Campbell‚Äôs Law imparts a more positive but complicated message. It is important to measure progress making use of quantitative and qualitative indicators. However, utilizing quantitative data for evaluation can distort and manipulate these indicators. Concrete measures must be adopted to reduce alteration and manipulation of information. In his article, ‚ÄúAssessing the Impact of Planned Social Change‚Äù, Campbell emphasized that ‚Äúthe more quantitative social indicator used for social decision-making is subjected to corruption pressure and liable to distort and damage social processes it meant to monitor.‚Äù See also  * Notes References  Adages Economics laws 1976 in economics ","title":"Campbell's law"},{"id":"9668151","text":"Hargreave may refer to: * Charles James Hargreave (1820 - 1866), English judge and mathematician * Sam Hargreave (1875 - 1929), English cricketer  See also  *Hargreaves (surname) *Hargrave (surname) ","title":"Hargreave"},{"id":"9668152","text":"Audiokinetic Inc. is a Canadian software company based in Montreal, Quebec that develops audio software for the video game industry.

Logo, located on the headstock. Kalamazoo is the name for two different lines of instruments produced by Gibson. In both cases Kalamazoo was a budget brand. The first consisted of such instruments as archtop, flat top and lap steel guitars, banjos, and mandolins made between 1933 and 1942, and the second, from 1965 to 1970, had solid-body electric and bass guitars. First series The first line of instruments included guitars with bodies between 14\\" and 16\\", which in 2009 were worth up to $1800. Second series The name was revived during the guitar boom of the late 1960s; at the time, guitar manufacturers \\"could sell just about anything they could make or lay their hands on\\". Gibson already had the Epiphone brand which it used to market more affordable guitars, but Epiphone was already a mid-level brand and Gibson desired something truly cheap. The Kalamazoo brand, whose guitars had bolt-on necks, filled that slot. \\"USA\\" was added to the name on the headstock to set it apart from cheaper, imported guitars. While the bolt-neck design was already a money saver, Gibson sought cheaper materials as well and found them in MDF (also known as Masonite). Money was also saved on the pickguard (a single sheet of plastic, not laminated) and the (open-back) tuners. =Electric guitars= The first design, made from 1965 to 1966, was really a copy of the Fender Mustang; the second, made from 1967 to 1969, resembled the Gibson SG. See Kalamazoo KG series shipping figureshttp://www.vintageguitarandbass.com/kalamazoo/KG_shipping.php. Models were the KG-1 (with one single-coil pickup), KG-1A (single-coil pickup and tremolo arm), KG-2 (dual single-coil pickups), and KG-2A (dual single-coil pickups and tremolo). , those guitars fetched between $275 and $375.. Guitars were built at Gibson's old electronics plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan, not the main Parsons street factory.http://www.vintageguitarandbass.com/kalamazoo/KG.php =Electric bass= The Kalamazoo Bass was introduced in 1966 and like the guitar model had two body styles resembling the Mustang and the SG. The earlier headstocks were, again, reminiscent of Fender models. Later headstocks bore a resemblance to that of the Gibson Thunderbird bass guitar. Several standard Gibson components were used in the KB, namely a typical EB series humbucker pickup used in many Epiphone basses. Sales were initially good, and during 1966-67 this was by far the best selling bass made at the Gibson plant. Production of the KB ceased in 1969. =Amplifiers= Simultaneously Gibson produced a line of Kalamazoo amplifiers, marketed primarily as budget model practice amps. The first amp introduced, the Model One, began production in 1965 along with the guitars. It was followed in 1966 by the Model Two. Both used vacuum tubes for preamplification, rectification, and output. Both had roughly a 5W output and a 10\\" Alnico speaker manufactured by Chicago Telephone Systems (CTS). Both models had volume and tone controls, but Model 2 added a tremolo knob, which set the tremolo frequency or switched it off; there was no tremolo depth control. The circuitry in the Kalamazoo Model Two is similar to the Gibson GA-5T Skylark amplifier of the same time period, as well as the Sano-ette made by Sano Amplifiers of New Jersey. The last of tube-style Models One and Two were given a brown, wooden look faceplate instead of the previous black panel, and are sometimes referred to as \\"brownface Zoo's\\" by Kalamazoo enthusiasts. Before ceasing production, Chicago Musical Instruments offered a solid state Model Two with a silver face place. http://blowsmeaway.com/kalamazoo.html These are actually labeled as \\"Model Two\\", but lacking the vintage \\"tube\\" sound, they do not enjoy the same collectible status as the black and brown faced models. Many today do not consider these models as desirable for use with guitars. However, they are fairly sought after by blues harmonica players for use in amplifying their sound with microphones due to their natural distortion and harmonics. But the relatively small output and the naturally higher frequencies of the EL84 power tubes often lead the Model One and Model Two to be used for studio recording, practice or performance in a smaller setting. Kalamazoo Model Two amplifier with a modified cabinet built from solid oak. Around 1969, solid state versions of the Models One and Two were issued in very limited numbers. These were renamed Model 3 and Model 4 respectively. These models, while novel in their day, ultimately proved unpopular. The Kalamazoo Reverb 12 was introduced as a larger, more powerful amplifier, boasting a 12W push-pull tube driven output through a 10\\" speaker. The Reverb 12 featured a better tremolo circuit than the Model 2, including depth control along with frequency. The tone was managed by individual bass and treble controls as opposed to the single tone control on earlier models, and boasted a spring reverb. Gibson also produced Kalamazoo bass amplifiers. The tube-driven Bass 30 and Bass 50 were both equipped with a pair of 10\\" Jensen speakers. These came in different confiurations over time: in one version the speakers were side by side with a flip-out control panel that became flush with the back of the cabinet when not in use; a vertical speaker configuration with a flip out panel; and a vertical configuration with a wood finish slanted panel like the guitar amps. The final models were simply labeled \\"Bass\\" without a number. The last run was apparently solid state instead of tube driven.http://www.rru.com/~meo/Guitar/Amps/Kalamazoo/ In its 1969 album Willy and the Poor Boys, the band Creedence Clearwater Revival's song \\"Down on the Corner\\" tells the story of a street corner band with hodge- podge instruments like a washboard, gut bass and kazoo. Also included is the line: \\"Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo\\" a reference to the budget line of guitars that Gibson produced. The song peaked at #3 on the Hot 100 on 20 December 1969. References External links * Official website of Gibson USA. Accessed on January 6, 2009. * Kalamazoo Amp Field Guide.

The idea of the meeting was to discuss the expansion of gambling in lower Manhattan. After eliminating their common enemies ‚Äì in particular Joe De Marco, who ran a restaurant and several gambling establishments on Mulberry Street in Lower Manhattan ‚Äì the Neapolitans went after the Sicilians. Morano ran a numbers game in Harlem, the territory of the Morello gang, but the returns were not sufficient to cover the tribute that the Morellos demanded.The Struggle for Control, GangRule.com The Neopolitans believed they also could take over other Harlem rackets, such as the artichoke monopoly, the coal and ice business and the lucrative zicchinetta card games, if they could eliminate the Morellos.

Terranova and Ubriaco were shot and killed. Subsequently, they went after other East Harlem gang leaders, killing Giuseppe Verrazano, but were unable to reach the Morellos who stayed close to their house in East 116th Street. The Neapolitans did not fear police investigations because they paid off police officers and omert√† prevented witnesses to step forward. However, in May 1917, Ralph Daniello, aka 'The Barber', a member of the Navy Street gang who had been present at the meetings to decide on the murders, began to tell the police everything he knew about Morano, the Neapolitan gangs, and the recent murders.

Johnno and Frankie had had problems in their marriage but were mostly happy. He had a good relationship with all of his children, but was particularly close with Steph. Johnno began working as a lorry driver with Les Hunter. Generally a friendly, good-natured personality and a devoted family man, Johnno's early storylines see him confront Ellie Hunter about her false testimony that her brother and his daughter Debbie Dean's boyfriend Dan Hunter committed a series of attacks, when the attacker was actually Ellie's husband Toby Mills. Johnno also caught his other daughter Steph Dean physical attacking Dan and Ellie's sister Lisa Hunter and had to pull Steph off her victim, before publicly reprimanding her for her behaviour. The family become heavily in debt after Johnno lost his job when his workplace collapsed and the Deans had to move homes. This resulted in a number of arguments between Johnno and Frankie that almost led to the collapse of their marriage. Johnno briefly turns to alcohol to cope with his troubles but when he realises how much he feels alienated from Frankie and how distressed Steph is after she is diagnosed as having epilepsy, he stopped drinking as heavily. After losing their house, Johnno and Frankie patched up their differences and began renting a house. Johnno began working for Richard Taylor, who took him on at his fitness club, Body Boost. When a rivalry between the Dean and Taylor families began, Richard terminated Johnno's job contract. However, Richard later re-employed Johnno at Body Boost and Jake took out a mortgage to help clear the family's debt accumulated. Still feeling alienated from Frankie, Johnno began an affair with 19-year-old student named Michelle. Frankie discovered Johnno‚Äôs affair and confronted him. Frankie still tried to save the marriage but decided to divorce Johnno when he revealed that Michelle was seven months pregnant with his baby, After learning the truth of their father, Jake, Debbie and Craig decided they did not want to have any contact with their father, except Steph (which she was completed devastated and begging him to come back home), as Johnno told her that, if there anything she need, he will help her, causing Steph forgiving him first, and then he left. His departure caused Steph began to alienated her mother and siblings for abandoned their relationship with him, and will never forgive them for hurting him, although she hide it for secret. In December 2004, Steph contact her father to wish her a Merry Christmas, and will return to Hollyoaks as soon as possible, which makes her happy. Johnno briefly returned in July 2005, telling his family that Michelle had left him for someone her own age and that she had told him that her baby was not his. Debbie has left town, but the rest of the family is still there and he wants a chance to make things up to them. Frankie, Jake and Craig are angry at him still for his affair. Steph begs her mother and brothers to forgive him. The family they is prepared to give Johnno another chance, however, Craig is unconvinced by Johnno's story so he rings Michelle and finds out that Johnno was lying and that he had in fact left Michelle and their newborn son Presley out of desperation after realising that he could not handle being a father again at his age. The family is disgusted by his behaviour, only Steph was willing to forgive him, angering her brothers and mother. Frankie eventually agrees to forgive Johnno for his affair as she felt life was too short to remain hostile towards the father of her children. Johnno still wants another shot with Frankie, but she makes it clear she is happy with her new partner Jack Osborne, and there was no hope of them reuniting. Johnno realises that Michelle and Presley need him more than his other family and decides to go back home and make up with Michelle. Frankie tells him he will always be her best friend. Her final words to him are: \\"For the first we met, we were standing at a bus stop in 1979, your cheeky grin, the white leather jacket, hair slicked back, Johnno Dean, who treats girls mean to keep them keen.\\" With their divorced was completed, Frankie told Jack that he and Michelle were married, where Steph was the bridesmaids. Frankie later invited him and Michelle to her wedding with Jack, but couldn't attend due to schedule conflicts. For the next few years, Johnno is pretty much out of his children's lives and they all begin to consider Jack to be their father. Although, Steph does maintain a closer relationship with him then her brothers and sister. Johnno later send his cheque to Steph on her birthday every year, unlike Craig, she accepts it. In 2008, when Johnno couldn't attend her wedding to Max Cunningham due to work comments, Steph asks Jack to walk her down the aisle. In 2010, Steph would later visit him after discovering that she has cancer, however after her death, Frankie call Johnno to inform, but didn't attend her funeral, due to flight conflicts. In 2016, Frankie went to stay with Johnno after visiting their daughter Debbie. Upon her return to the village, she mentioned to Jack that Johnno was doing well and his relationship with Michelle was stronger. Two days later, Frankie got a call from Johnno that their children is now closer to him than before, for which she is happiness and knew that this is what Steph's wanted to see. A year later, Johnno returns to the village and see Frankie once again to invite her to tour with him as a Cher impersonator. She tells him she wishes they hadn't broken up but is torn about whether to leave Jack and accept his offer. She eventually chooses Jack and Johnno leaves after Frankie tells him that he is still her best friend. Two days later, Jack called him that Frankie is dead, which devastated him and couldn't attend the funeral, after he allowed him to go, due to his impersonator tour.

Starting out as a low-level member of the St. Louis gang known as the Egan's Rats, Brothers was once the manager and a bouncer at The Green Mill in Chicago. Brothers soon graduated into labor racketeering and contract murder. Dodging a 1929 murder indictment, Brothers fled to Chicago, where he found work in the Chicago Outfit, under the notorious crime boss, Al Capone. Leo was ultimately convicted of the Lingle murder and sentenced to 14 years. His attorney was Louis Piquett, who later became famous as John Dillinger's lawyer. Most observers, then and now, believe that Brothers was handed up to the state by Capone as a sacrifice. Mario Gomes, Capone historian says that Frank (Frankie) Foster who was a triggerman for the North Side Mob and later the Chicago Outfit was most likely the man who pulled the trigger on the Jake Lingle contract. The contract was handed out and organized by Jack Zuta. After his release in 1940, Brothers returned to St. Louis, beat his original murder case, and became hooked up with the local mob.

In England he served as MP for Ashburton in 1767 and between 1774 and 1787 and for Wareham, between 1768 and 1774.Sutherland Origins Robert Palk was born in December 1717 at Lower Headborough Farm in the parish of Ashburton, Devon,Situated on the outskirts of Ashburton on the road towards Buckland in the Moor (Love, Introduction, p.v) and was baptised on 16 December 1717 at the Old Mission House, Ashburton.Love, Introduction, p.v; Sutherland His father was Walter Palk, born in 1686, of yeoman farmer stockLove, Introduction, p.v and his mother was Frances Abraham, the daughter of Robert Abraham.Sutherland Walter Palk supplemented his income by acting as a carrier of serge from the cloth mills at Ashburton over Haldon Hill to market at Exeter.

According to Robert's own statements, the Palk family was resident at Ambrooke in the late 15th century, which at the time of Robert's birth in 1717 was owned by the Neyle family.Love, Introduction, p.v This would therefore appear to discount suppositions in some sources that Robert himself was born at Ambrooke. Education He was educated at Ashburton Grammar School, and was subsequently sponsored by his maternal uncle and godfather Robert Abraham, to attend Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1739. Career Palk was ordained as a deacon in 1739 at Exeter Cathedral by Bishop Weston and held two curacies in Cornwall at Egloskerry and Launcells, before going to London in 1741. During his time in London he attracted the attention and favour of Sir Robert Walpole, generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, under whose auspices he was sent to India. In 1747 he was appointed naval chaplain to Admiral Edward Boscawen on the Namura, bound for India. He arrived at Fort St David in 1748, at the time when the French were in control of Fort St George in Madras, and vying with the British for trade supremacy. Initially this rivalry was merely a trade war, with only a minimal presence of armed troops, whose task it was to guard the warehouses. Soon however the situation evolved into armed fighting between the French and British, and eventually the British Government recognised they were at war with France over control of India. General Stringer Lawrence was given the task of forming an army, and history now remembers him as the \\"Father of the Indian Army\\". An Act of Parliament was passed in 1773 which effectively took control of Indian interests away from the East India Company and its shareholders and placed it into the hands of The Crown.  Promotion  Early in 1749 the chaplain at Fort St David, Francis Fordyce, publicly insulted Robert Clive, leading to his dismissal, and replacement by Robert Palk. This important promotion led to disagreements regarding the seniority of Palk over other chaplains. Palk sailed to Bombay in October 1750 with the intention of resigning his post and seeking formal employment with the East India Company. However, matters were resolved and he was re-instated and returned to Fort St David in March 1751. It was at this time that Palk made the acquaintance of Stringer Lawrence, after which time they remained lifelong friends. Robert Clive was an army officer in the East India Company and later became Governor of Bengal. He arrived in India almost penniless, and due to his hard work and dedication to the King and the East India Company, he was well rewarded with many opportunities by his mentor, Stringer Lawrence. He later became the 1st Baron Clive of Plassey and made a fortune in India greater than Palk or Stringer Lawrence could ever have dreamt of. In 1752 Robert Palk was appointed to the lucrative position of \\"Paymaster and Commissary in the Field\\" to Lawrence's army. In January 1754 Palk and Henry Vansittart were appointed to discuss the terms of a peace settlement with the French who controlled a large part of India. A year later a settlement was reached. A colleague of Palk's in Madras, Robert Orme, noted at that time that \\"Palk had long ince given up studies of history and theology and had thrown himself into active engagement with the contemporary affairs of the British at Madras\\". Palk was starting to amass a small fortune, mainly due to Stringer Lawrence putting lucrative deals in his direction, but the directors of the Company soon instructed Palk to confine himself to his religious duties. This did not sit well with Palk and he returned to England. He renounced his clerical vows and on 7 February 1761 married Anne Vansittart, the sister of Henry Vansittart, his wealthy and well-respected colleague in India, whose family home was Shottesbrooke Park in Berkshire. While back in England, the East India Company was experiencing various trading difficulties in India. At the Company's London Headquarters during discussions concerning who might be able to resolve the problem, one of the members declared: \\"Gentlemen, you forget, we have Palk at home\\". With one voice the members replied \\"The very man!\\" Thus Robert Palk returned to India in October 1761 and was invited to serve on the Council of the Company. He was appointed to membership of the Treasury Committee and also served as the Export Warehouse Keeper. When George Pigot resigned in November 1763, it made way for Palk to take up the post of Governor of Madras. With his new-found authority Palk entered more deeply into the world of trade, all the time enlarging his personal wealth. Palk eventually left India in January 1767 at the age of 50, and was well received by both King George III and the Court of Directors on his return. Returning to England was not however the end of his involvement with India. He provided introductions and was patron to many who, like himself, went to India with the intention of making themselves a fortune. His nephew Jonathan Palk said of his uncle Robert: :\\"Rectitude of mind and benignity of heart formed the outline of his character. Uncorrupted by the luxury of the East, he was an encourager of bodily and mental exertion, furnishing his friends with the means not of idleness, but of being active for their own good and the good of society. My father was a little farmer with a large family; for him my uncle bought an estate, which enabled him to live a credit to his mother, and respected by his neighbours\\".  Election to Parliament  Robert Palk served as MP for Ashburton in 1767 for Wareham, between 1768 and 1774 (due to the influence of Calcraft, at the time Secretary for War) and again for Ashburton between 1774 and 1787.Sutherland His brother Walter Palk also served as MP for Ashburton. Despite living in Torquay and then at Haldon House near Exeter, he continued his involvement with the parish of Ashburton, where he owned land and supplied the parish church with a new organ. Robert Palk took a great interest in political matters, especially in matters concerning India and the British East India Company and mainly supported the government. Palk was a Tory in sentiment but resented Lord North's Act of 1773, for the regulation of the East India Company. The Warren Hastings Correspondence in the British Museum contains many letters written by Robert Palk to Warren Hastings between 1767 and 1782. Hastings was the first Governor General of India and often wrote to Palk back in England. Some of the letters in the Palk Manuscripts are written by Hastings asking favours of Sir Robert. Diamonds were a key method of sending large sums of money back to England and one letter concerning these is dated March 1770, as follows: :\\"Fort St. George. Dear Sir, I must trouble you again to desire that you will not sell the diamonds by an advance on the invoice price, which I understand is the usual method, because they are, I am assured, of a superior quality to most sent to England by this ship. You will be pleased therefore to open the bulses, and rate them by their quality when you dispose of them. I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant, Warren Hastings. Baronetcy On 14 November 1760 \\"Robert Palk of Headborough\\" received a grant of arms as follows: Sable, an eagle displayed argent beaked and legged or a bordure engrailed of the second with crest: On a semi-terrestrial globe of the northern hemisphere proper an eagle rising as in the armsPolwhele, Richard, History of Devonshire, 3 Vols., Vol.2, London, 1793, p. 181, footnote with supporters: Two Asian Indians in loincloths and turbans.Berry, William, Encyclopaedia Heraldica, Or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry, Volume 2 His motto was: Deo DucentePolwhele (\\"With God Guiding\\"). He was made a baronet on 19 June 1782 by King George III, in recognition of his efforts in securing India for Britain. He was then admitted by the Mayor of Exeter as a Freeman of the City of Exeter, a privilege his son and successive heirs retained until 1883. Landholdings Tor Mohun.

In this episode, Graham Norton makes his first of three appearances as Father Noel Furlong. Plot It is time for Ted, Dougal, and Jack to take their annual holiday. They go to the Kilkelly Caravan Park, where Ted's friend, Father O'Rourke, has offered them use of his caravan. Following the vague directions, Ted mistakes a rather luxurious caravan as O'Rourke's, only to find it occupied by a young couple showering together - the husband comes out of the shower while talking to his wife and discovers the Fathers, left confused upon seeing them. After apologising profusely to the couple and the garda√≠, Ted recognises that their caravan is a compact, squalid model, with barely enough room for the three of them. Only then does Ted realise that Dougal forgot to hitch the trailer containing all of their games and entertainment back at the parochial house. After putting a cardboard 'sleeping box' over Jack's head to put him asleep, Ted and Dougal quickly exhaust all of the activities within the caravan. Pushing Jack in a wheelchair, they later explore the only two attractions nearby, St. Kevin's Stump and the Magic Road, where the laws of gravity seemingly disappear. While Ted and Dougal are distracted, Jack's wheelchair is dragged up the Magic Road, and he falls over a cliff, screaming a rather long \\"Drink!\\" as he descends; the other Fathers think Jack has just gone for his own walk. After Ted and Dougal inadvertently come across the same young couple from the luxury caravan making out behind a rock, Ted has another word with the police, and he decides to report Jack missing. After it starts to rain heavily, Ted and Dougal return to the caravan, only to find for themselves that Father O'Rourke has also promised its use to Father Noel Furlong and his youth group, who are cramped inside and having a sing-song. Noel's boundless energy quickly grates on Ted, and confuses Dougal. Ted decides they will cut their vacation short, but before leaving, he uses an outhouse, but realises too late that it is already in use by the young woman from the luxury caravan. Her husband, clad only in a towel, chases after the Fathers as they get in their car in a bid to drive off. The man hangs onto the bonnet as Ted races away from the caravan park, losing the towel along the way. Ted eventually stops, giving time for the man to, via being sent flying by the abrupt stop, get off; the man finds a glass bottle that he punctures the car's tyres with before he walks off. Ted and Dougal, refusing to go back to the park, look to hitchhike home. They are elated when island eccentric Tom, transporting raw sewage in a tanker-truck which he, at the start of the start of this episode was given the responsibility of driving, offers them a ride. He however hits the wrong button to open the door, and instead opens the sewage release valve, treating the Fathers to a foul drenching. Meanwhile, Jack is later shown on a luxury yacht - as he regains consciousness, he discovers that he is surrounded by \\"drink\\" and beautiful \\"girls\\" - he has awakened in the company of two of his favourite things. Continuity Father Jack's regular vocabulary is expanded by one word starting in this episode, with \\"Girls!\\" being the new addition. Production The Caravan site is located at Fanore Beach, County Clare, on the west coast of Ireland. The writers based the episode on their own childhood experiences. The caravan park was based on Graham Linehan's memories of being taken on two-week-long holidays to grim caravan parks where it would always rain and there would be a plentiful supply of children to bully him. He would describe it as a \\"holiday in Hell\\", hence the episode's title. The unusual attractions such as the Magic Road were based on real-life locations Arthur Mathews had visited. During the filming of the scene in \\"Entertaining Father Stone\\", in which the priests play crazy golf in a rainstorm, which caused the actors to get soaking wet, Dermot Morgan joked that next time the writers will probably get them covered in raw sewage. This is the entire reason why the scene where Ted and Dougal are sprayed with sewage was written. The actors did not realise that the substance made up to look like sewage was extremely cold; this caused them to run away from it very quickly when it was sprayed on them, and the writers to feel guilty about making them do it. Legacy This episode includes one of the show's more memorable scenes, where Ted is trying to explain perspective to Dougal while in the caravan. In it, Ted says \\"These [holding up toy cows] are small... but the ones out there [pointing to real cows in a distant field] are far away. Small... far away... ah forget it!\\" The scene is considered one of the show's most iconic, and was named as the third-best one-liner of any British sitcom in a January 2017 survey by The Telegraph. The line was used to name Small, Far Away, a documentary of the show created by creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews on the 15th anniversary of the show's premiere.

He lost the following election two years later to the Liberal Party after Labor had held office for fourteen years previously. Wise was a farmer for several years in Queensland before working in the Department of Agriculture in that state. He later moved to Western Australia as a technical adviser in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and in 1928 was commissioned to report and advise on tropical agriculture in the Northern Territory and the North West of Western Australia. In the 1933 state election which saw future Premiers Albert Hawke and John Tonkin also win seats, Wise successfully contested the seat of Gascoyne (now merged into Murchison-Eyre) in the state's lower house for the Labor Party. In 1936 he moved to the front bench as Minister for Agriculture and the North-West. For reasons of ill health, John Willcock resigned his premiership on 31 July 1945 and Wise was elected into the position. Wise held the position for only two years until the 1947 election when his party lost to the Liberals headed by Sir Ross McLarty.

Function  Daxx, a Death domain-associated protein, was first discovered through its cytoplasmic interaction with the classical death receptor Fas. It has been associated with heterochromatin and PML-NBs (Promyelocytic Leukaemia nuclear bodies) and has been implicated in many nuclear processes including transcription and cell cycle regulation. This gene encodes a multifunctional protein that resides in multiple locations in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Daxx serves as an H3.3 specific histone chaperone, interacting with an H3.3/H4 dimer. It interacts with a wide variety of proteins, such as apoptosis antigen Fas, centromere protein C, and transcription factor erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1). In the nucleus, the encoded protein functions as a potent transcription repressor that binds to sumoylated transcription factors. Its repression can be relieved by the sequestration of this protein into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies or nucleoli. This protein also associates with centromeres in G2 phase. In the cytoplasm, the encoded protein may function to regulate apoptosis. The subcellular localization and function of this protein are modulated by post- translational modifications, including sumoylation, phosphorylation and polyubiquitination.  Structure and localization  Daxx is uniformly expressed throughout the body, except in the testes and thymus, which have especially high expression of the protein. At the level of the cell, Daxx is found in the cytoplasm, interacting with Fas-receptor or other cytoplasmic molecules, as well as in the nucleus, where it is interacting with some subnuclear structures. Several additional interacting proteins are known, but not always is there an understanding of the specific function and relevance of this interaction. = Nuclear = When the PML-NB are absent or disrupted, Daxx is delocalized and apoptosis does not occur. This interaction was demonstrated when PML-NB disrupted cells were treated and Daxx relocalized with the PML-NB. ATRX, a centromeric heterochromatin component co-localizes with Daxx. This partnership is found mainly in the S-phase of the cell cycle. No expression of Daxx leads to malfunction of S phase and cells with two nuclei are formed. Another centromeric component, CENP-C, associates with Daxx during interphase. While at first Daxx was said to be a ‚Äúdeath protein‚Äù, it is suggested that associating with centromeric components leads to another function of Daxx. = Cytoplasmic and membrane = Fas-receptor stimulation causes Daxx to translocate out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. The breakdown of glucose produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). These induce extracellular Daxx to translocalize into the cytoplasm following an association with ASK1 (Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1). Another mechanism for exogenous Daxx import involves CRM1. This transport mechanism is phosphorylation dependent. Nevertheless, it is not known whether the Fas- receptor stimuli or the ASK1 overexpression are caused by ROS or CRM1 mediated export.  Role in apoptosis  = Fas-induced = After Fas stimulation, Daxx is activated and plays its role of pro-apoptotic protein in activating the c-JUN-N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway. This pathway normally regulates stress-induced cell death. It is also essential for development of nerval system by programmed cell death. The real apoptotic process starts after activating this pathway. Daxx does not activate JNK itself but rather the upstream JNK kinase kinase ASK1. Some kind of positive feedback system was also discovered; JNK activates HIPK2, which stands for the translocation of nuclear Daxx to the cytoplasm. In turn, Daxx activates ASK1. = TGF-Œ≤ regulated = TGF-Œ≤ regulates a variety of different cellular developmental processes including growth, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death. Daxx interacts with the TGF-Œ≤ type II receptor by binding of C-terminal domain of the protein. When the cell is treated with TGF-Œ≤, HIPK2, a nuclear kinase, phosphorylates Daxx and the activated Daxx in turn activates the JNK pathway (see \\"The Daxx Pathway\\" figure). = Miscellaneous mechanisms = Glucose breakdown produces ROS, which leads to Daxx production and relocalization, activating JNK pathway in turn. Another inducer of Daxx production is the exposure to UV-radiation. ASK1 will be transported to the nucleus when UV- irradiation is used to treat the cell. It is still unknown as to whether ASK1 binds Daxx, due to UV-irradiation. Another important cell death-property of Daxx is the association with PML-NB. It was shown that Daxx associates with Pml only when exposed to high oxidative stress or UV-irradiation. Another study showed loss of Daxx pro-apoptotic function in case of a mutant without Pml. = Anti-apoptotic function = A rather surprising property of Daxx is its anti-apoptotic function. When Daxx was not expressed or disrupted during embryonic development, it resulted in an early stage lethality. Other studies showed that lack of Daxx gene caused a higher apoptotic rate in embryonic stem cells. Only when Daxx was bound to Pml were apoptosis rates higher, suggesting that associated cytoplasmic Daxx has the role of an anti-apoptotic molecule. The DAXX Pathway  Other functions  The omnipresence of Daxx in the cell nucleus suggests that the protein may also function as a transcription factor.

The championship was eagerly awaited because for the first time since 1958, three of the Home Nations were featuring in a World Cup; the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain and this was a chance to see them in competitive action before the World Cup began. The end-of-season format that had been used throughout the 1970s was dropped as it was felt three games in eight days was too intense at the end of a season and prior to a World Cup. The English began impressively with a heavy victory over Northern Ireland at home, followed by victory away in Wales. The Scots could only manage a draw with the disappointing Irish by contrast although they did beat Wales. The Welsh managed to salvage a result in their third game with a 3‚Äì0 defeat of Northern Ireland to claim third place. In the final deciding match in Glasgow, England edged victory through a Paul Mariner goal and thus claimed the championship. In the World Cup, Scotland were eliminated in the first round whilst England went out in the second round without losing a game.

Biography Anne Knollys was the third daughter of Sir Francis Knollys, Treasurer of the Royal Household (1514‚Äì1596) to Queen Elizabeth I, and his wife Lady Catherine Carey. Her maternal grandparents were Sir William Carey and Mary Boleyn. Mary was a sister of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII of England. Anne Knollys' mother was thus a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn had preceded her more famous sister in the King's affections, and had affairs with both Francis I of France and Henry VIII. Both Catherine Carey and Henry Carey may have been Henry's children, although we are unsure of their exact dates of birth. If true, this would make Anne the granddaughter of Henry VIII. Anne's eldest sister was Lettice Knollys, chief Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth and the mother of the queen's favourite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. Marriage and issue Anne Knollys married, on 19 November 1571, Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr, by whom she had six sons and eight daughters: *Sir Robert West, who married Elizabeth Coks and predeceased his father. *Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (7 July 1577 ‚Äì c.

Though it lacked any particular style, there might be said to have been a move towards a synthesis of influences from Indian art history together with styles prevalent in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th Century, including Post- Impressionism, Cubism and Expressionism. History The Progressive Artists' Group was formed by six founder members, F. N. Souza, S. H. Raza, M. F. Husain, K. H. Ara, H. A. Gade, and S. K. Bakre (the only sculptor in the group). Others associated with the group included Manishi Dey, Ram Kumar, Akbar Padamsee and Tyeb Mehta.National Gallery of Modern Art The group wished to break with the revivalist nationalism established by the Bengal school of art and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level. The Group was formed just months after the 14 August 1947 \\"Partition of India\\" and Pakistan that resulted in religious rioting and death of tens of thousands of people displaced by the new borders. The founders of the Progressive Artists Group often cite \\"the partition\\" as impetus for their desire for new standards in India, starting with their new style of art.Ratan Parimoo and Nalini Bhagwat: Progressive Artists Group of Bombay: An Overview over The Spirit of Late 1940s and Early 1950s Their intention was to \\"paint with absolute freedom for content and technique, almost anarchic, save that we are governed by one or two sound elemental and eternal laws, of aesthetic order, plastic co-ordination and colour composition.\\"Overview of India Art: Progressive Artists Group In 1950, Vasudeo S. Gaitonde, Prafulla Dahanukar, Krishen Khanna and Mohan Samant joined the Group. Following the departure of the two main founders Souza and Raza from India few years later, S.K. Bakre also left the group, which ultimately disbanded in 1956. European Modernism was the most distinctive influence on the group, but its members worked in dramatically different styles, from the Expressionism of Souza to the pure abstraction of Gaitonde. Specific Indian imagery and landscapes were also adopted, particularly by Mehta and Husain. Through the incorporation and mixture of new, abstract styles with traditional Indian art elements and Media, the PAG is one of the most influential art movements in India until today. In 2015, F.N. Souza's painting \\"Birth\\" set a new record for Indian art with a hammer price above US$ 4 Mio, which shows the worldwide appeal of the group.

The school was as a separate undergraduate college at Dartmouth comparable to the earlier Lawrence Scientific School (1847) at Harvard University and the later Sheffield Scientific School (1854) at Yale University. Chandler students established their own fraternities (Phi Zeta Mu, later Eta Eta Chapter of Sigma Chi, now The Tabard, and Sigma Delta Pi/Vitruvian, later Beta Theta Pi); sat in their own pews for morning services in the Old Chapel in Dartmouth Hall; and had their own sports teams. Classes took place in Chandler Hall, which stood between Parkhurst Hall and the Blunt Alumni Center. The building, built by Moor's Charity School in 1835 and designed by Ammi B. Young, was remodeled with a Mansard roof by Chandler mathematics professor Frank Asbury Sherman in 1871 and received a rear addition in 1898, designed by Charles Alonzo Rich, a Chandler graduate of 1876 and designing partner of the New York architects Lamb & Rich. Dartmouth absorbed the Chandler Scientific School in 1893 and continued as the Departments of Zoology, Botany, and Geology.

Early life Esma Sultan was born on 16 July 1778 in the Topkapƒ± Palace. Her father was Abdul Hamid I and Her mother was Sineperver Sultan. She had an elder brother ≈ûehzade Ahmed two years elder then her, a younger brother named Mustafa IV one year younger then her, and a younger sister named Fatma Sultan four years younger then her. When she was 11 years old, her father died. Since Mustafa was only 10 years old at the time of his father‚Äôs death. Selim III ascended to the throne as the eldest male member of the Ottoman Empire. She followed her mother to the old palace. When she was 14 her cousin Selim III married her to K√º√ß√ºk Huseyn Pasha. Esma Sultan spend her time in her childhood by reading books, musical instruments and games, her mother, Sineperver, was most likely to manage these entertainments in her apartment. Marriage Selim III chose K√º√ßuk H√ºseyin Pasha as the husband for Esma, who was the foster-brother of Selim. The engagement of Esma Sultan and H√ºseyin Pasha took place on 29 May 1792. The wedding processions were held in Istanbul, the deputy of Esma Sultan was Darussade Agha. On 19 December 1792, the wedding of Esma Sultan H√ºseyin Pasha took place. Princesses weddings as tradition, started on Wednesdays with the dowry procession being sent to the couple's seat and continued with the henna night held that evening. Valuable gifts were also sent by Mihri≈üah Sultan at the wedding of Esma Sultan. The gifts of the Valide Sultan were as follows: one medium-sized and 706 small rose diamonds and a chandelier decorated with red rubies and diamonds; For the palace of the sultan's house in Divanyolu, 18 pieces of Austrian footbed pillows, 3 pieces of Polish-made striped and fringed, solid wire upper mat cushion, 3 pieces of mattress. Esma Sultan entered the palace in the palace in Divanyolu, which was repaired a year ago, in the place of the current Sultan Mahmud Mausoleum. The marriage of Esma Sultan with H√ºseyin Pasha lasted 11 years. Her husband died on 8 December 1803 and was buried in Mihri≈üah Sultan Mausoleum at Ey√ºp. She never married again. Esma Sultan lived a colourful life after the death of her husband, to believe what the witnesses told of the period, this life even caused various rumors to emerge, although she didn‚Äôt cared and continued the lifestyle until her death. Widowhood =Adopted children= She lived with luxury in her magnificent villa in Istanbul, but still her life passed in sadness because she could not have the one thing she wished for most; a child. At length she decided to adopt a child. After reaching satisfactory terms with the mother and father, she adopted Rahime Perestu, one year of age. Rahime was particularly diminutive, delicate and graceful, so she renamed her Perestu, the Persian word for swallow. All the kalfas in Esma Sultan's villa behaved toward this child as though she were a daughter of an Ottoman imperial princess, and indeed her disposition and manners were so lovely that they became devoted to her. In 1844, her nephew Abdulmejid I asked in hand for the marriage for Perestu, firstly, she refused to give Perestu's hand in marriage but consented on the condition that the Sultan legally marries her and not consider her a concubine , which he did. One week after that, Perestu was sent off to Topkapƒ± Palace to the harem. She herself educated Bezmi√¢lem Sultan, the ninth wife of her brother Mahmud II and the mother of Abdulmejid I. =Political influence= Unlike other princesses, Esma was politically active. In the Kabak√ßƒ± revolt, who wanted Selim to be removed from the throne, he was influential with her mother Sineperver Sultan. She planned a rebellious rebellion in the reign of Mahmud. She personally send letters to Janissaries for restoring Mustafa back to the throne and met them personally. After Mahmud succeeded the throne, she wanted her brother Mustafa to succeed the throne again but didn't succeeded. Mahmud who knew about Esma's political activities, didn't intervene in the affairs as he loved Esma Sultan like his own sister, but Esma and her sister Hibetullah Sultan were kept under close surveillance by Mahmud, and they both were forbade to have communications with the outsiders. Mustafa was executed on 16 November 1808. Esma Sultan exercised great influence over her brother Mahmud during his reign of 31 years. Mahmud II loved his sister very much and Esma Sultan also esteemed him. They always visited each other and sometimes. Esma Sultan was respected by both Mustafa IV and Mahmud II. Esma Sultan became the empire's richest woman at that time. She had three revenues Ey√ºp Palace, Ma√ßka Palace and Tirnak√ßƒ± Palace. She lived their with her large staff, there were some land assigned to Esma Sultan in Crete, Kemer, Edremit and Biga. Palaces and revenues Esma Sultan, bought many farms around Istanbul, built palaces in Ey√ºp, Ma√ßka, and Tirnak√ßƒ± and Kuru√ße≈üme mansions in Boƒüazi√ßi.. Thanks to the high position of her husband, she had important influence over Ottoman society. She owned a palace in Divanyolu, kiosks in √áamlƒ±ca, Ma√ßka and Ey√ºp and a waterfront mansion in Kuru√ße≈üme at Bosporus. As the guest of Esma Sultan, Miss Julia Pardoe, who went to Tirnak√ßƒ±, gave detailed information about the mansion. Miss Pardoe described the mansion as follows: After the waiting hall leading up the stairs, after passing several rooms and a hall with twelve windows on one side overlooking the Bosphorus and on the mansion gardens, the harem apartment was coming. Esma Sultan was interested in British culture; she was said to have furnished her palace with Western furniture, putting all of the traditional Ottoman furniture in a storage room. After her death, all of her English furniture was put away in the same storage room and the old oriental ones taken out once again.Philip Mansel, Constantinople: City of the World's Desire (London, 1995), pp. 257‚Äì258. Death Esma Sultan died on 4 June 1848 in Istanbul, nine years after the death of Mahmud, she was buried the Mausoleum of Mahmud at Divanyolu Street, Istanbul, Turkey.

The first decade of his scientific career he spent on fundamental research on malaria parasites and later on translational research for malaria vaccines. In the year 2000 he switched to advanced data stewardship and (biological) systems analytics. He is currently a professor in Leiden and most known for innovations in scholarly collaboration, especially nanopublications, knowledge graph based discovery and most recently the FAIR data initiative and GO FAIR. Since 2012 he is a Professor in biosemantics in the Department of Human Genetics at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in The Netherlands. In 2015 Barend was appointed chair of the High Level Expert Group on the European Open Science Cloud. Since 2017 Barend is heading the International Support and Coordination office of the GO FAIR initiative. He is also the elected president of CODATA, the standing committee on research data related issues of the International Science Council. Barend is a member of the Netherlands Academy of Technology and Innovation(ACTI). He is also the European representative in the Board on research Data and Information (BRDI) of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine in the USA. Barend is a frequent keynote speaker about FAIR and open science around the world, and participates in various scientific advisory board of international research projects.  Education  Mons was awarded a Masters (1981 Cum Laude) and a PhD (1986) from Leiden University on cellular and molecular biology of the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, and has worked for more than ten years on the genetic differentiation of malaria parasites,The problem of multiplicity in malaria vaccine development, B. Mons, Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, Volume 91, Issue 2 March 1997 , pages 55-58Makelov, H; Mons, B; Roumiantzeff, M; Wigzell, H, European Commission COST/STD Initiative. Report of the expert panel X. Animals models for vaccines to prevent infectious diseases, Vaccine 1996/May, 14(7):717-31 publishing over 45 research articles. After switching to biosemantics he published some 80 papers on this area, many of them highly cited. (see Google Scholar) Past career In 1993 Mons joined the European Commission as a Seconded National Expert with the task to develop and support international scientific networks, especially with developing countries as partners. While at the EC, in the early days of the internet, he pioneered one of the first electronic interactive communication systems for science networking with developing countries, SHARED, for which he started to (co-)design thesaurus- based concept extraction technologies in order to match across languages and jargon. From 1996 to 1999 he served the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (The National Research Council, NWO) as a senior advisor on International Health Research. After leaving NWO he co-founded the SME Collexis B.V. (later acquired by Elsevier Science) and also started the first Biosemantics Group at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. In addition to his research and teaching responsibilities, Mons has remained involved in international scientific management and networking at various levels. After leaving Collexis in 2005 he co-founded Knewco, Inc. in 2006, and more recently, part of his intellectual legacy was the basis for the founding of the successful SME Euretos, focused on advanced machine learning over machine readable data, now also being used for academic research purposes. From 2008, Barend served as a scientific director of the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre, the predecessor of the current Dutch Techcentre for the Life Sciences (DTL), which he co-founded. DTL was one of the initial supporters of the FAIR data concept. He served as the ‚ÄòIntegrator for Life Sciences‚Äô in the Netherlands e- Science Center from its inception till 2016, where he was one of the initiators of an early white paper: Data-Stewardship in the Big Data Era: Taking Care of Data (2013). Barend was on of the designers and coordinators of the transformational Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project known as Open PHACTS, pioneering the use of semantic technologies, nanopublications and micro-attributions in pharmaceutical biomedical research. From 2013-2015 he acted as Head of Node of the Dutch Node in ELIXIR. In 2014 he initiated the FAIR Data initiative and in 2015 he was appointed Chair of the High Level Expert Group for the European Open Science Cloud.. Present activities His present research activities in LUMC mainly focus on open science, and international knowledge sharing and networking. A more specific aim in his research group is to realise a new form of computer-assisted distributed annotation and learning and on-line knowledge discovery, based on the semantic technologies that his research yielded over the years, including nanopublications. Since 2017 his main task has been to set up and lead the international initiative Global Open FAIR (GO FAIR), which is aimed at implementing the FAIR guiding principles in order to create an ‚ÄòInternet for Machines‚Äô to support open science and innovation. In his capacity of President of CODATA he works with an international executive committee to support open science data policies and practices. He recently published the handbook Data Stewardship for Open Science, Implementing FAIR Principles, which is functionally integrated with an on line data stewardship wizard.

The first was a town located in Collin County that had a post office designated as Lebanon, Texas, before it was relocated to Frisco, Texas. The second was a smaller unincorporated community located in Live Oak County of which only a cemetery remains today. Town of Lebanon in Collin County, Texas When the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers in the 1840s, many of the settlers traveled by wagon trains along the old Shawnee Trail, which was also used for cattle drives north from Austin. This trail later became known as the Preston Trail and eventually, Preston Road. The town of Lebanon was founded along this trail to take advantage of this activity and the fertile farmland in the area. It was reportedly named after one of the settler's hometown of Lebanon, Tennessee. The town was granted a U.S. post office in 1860 and by the 1880s it had a church, a school, a cotton gin, a flour mill, a blacksmith, and many other merchants.Frisco Heritage Center - Lebanon Baptist Church In the late 1890s, the town of Lebanon hoped that the new railroad being built in the area would run through town. However, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway chose a route two miles west of the town. In addition, the railroad established a new town along its route in order to provide water for the trains, which sealed Lebanon's fate. The new town of Emerson was established in 1902 three miles northwest of Lebanon, and would rename itself Frisco after the railroad that had created it. Most residents and businesses in Lebanon picked up and relocated to the new town of Frisco. In 1905, the post office in Lebanon was closed down.Collin County History - Lebanon No longer a town, Lebanon remained a farming community of a dozen houses, a school, and a church. The school closed in 1947 and by 2000 only the church and a couple houses remained from the original town.Collin County History - Lebanon In 2003, the Lebanon Baptist Church closed after 120 years of services in that location (the current building dating from 1904 after the original 1883 church was destroyed by a storm).Collin County History - Lebanon Baptist Church By this time the original town site had been annexed into the growing city of Frisco and Preston Road (now a state highway) was being widened to six lanes. To avoid demolition, the church was donated to the City of Frisco and the building was moved to the Frisco Heritage Center where it is now part of the museum as well as being used as a wedding chapel.Frisco Heritage Center - Lebanon Baptist Church At about the same time, the last house dating from the town of Lebanon (built in 1895) was also moved to the Frisco Heritage Center.Frisco Heritage Center - Crozier House The old town of Lebanon was located near what is now the intersection of Preston Road and John Hickman Parkway in the city of Frisco, Texas. Lebanon Baptist Church was originally located on the north edge of the old town, near what is now the intersection of Preston Road and Lebanon Road in Frisco. In addition to the history preserved at the Frisco Heritage Center, references to the original town can be seen in other places in Frisco: The City of Frisco named Lebanon Road in honor of the town; the Masonic Lodge in downtown Frisco is called the Lebanon Masonic Lodge;FriscoMasons.org and the Frisco Independent School District named their ninth high school Lebanon Trail High School (which is less than a mile from the old town's location).Dallas Morning News - Frisco Blog, Feb. 10, 2015 In Addition, Inside of the School, the main hall includes a floor stating, \\"Lebanon, Texas founded in 1860.\\" Community of Lebanon in Live Oak County, Texas The unincorporated community of Lebanon in Live Oak County, Texas, was on a dirt road a mile north of Farm Road 1203 and twelve miles southeast of Three Rivers, Texas. A school was built at the site in the 1880s. During the 1890s a Methodist congregation was organized in the vicinity and used the schoolhouse for its services. A number of revivals were held in Lebanon during the 1890s, sometimes attracting as many as 600 people from communities in Live Oak and Bee Counties. Around 1920, the church was moved to Cadiz, a nearby town in Bee County, and by 1940 Lebanon's Methodist congregation had been disbanded. A map drawn in the late 1930s shows only a graveyard at the site.Lebanon, TX (Live Oak County)Sparkman, Ervin L.

In the years before the Second World War, he acquired a reputation as an amateur Norfolk dialect comedian, performing at social functions in many parts of the county and on the radio. However, he is most famous for The Boy John Letters. The letters appeared in the Eastern Daily Press, the regional newspaper, at irregular intervals. Grapes would simply write them when he felt like it - and they were always signed \\"The Boy John\\". They reported the events in the Boy John's village, and, in addition to the Boy John - a farm worker - they featured as their main characters his Aunt Agatha, Granfar, and old Mrs. W, their neighbour.

Ramganga West  Ramganga West River originates from Doodhatoli ranges in the district of Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand state of India. The Ramganga River flows to south east from Kumaun Himalaya. It is a tributary of the river Ganges, originates from the high altitude zone of Namik Glacier(3600 m). Ramganga flows by the Corbett National Park near Ramnagar of Nainital district from where it descends upon the plains. Bijnor, Moradabad, Bareilly, Badaun, Shahjahanpur and Hardoi cities of Uttar Pradesh are situated on its banks. The Ramganga Dam crosses the river at Kalagarh (Partially in Bijnor District & Pauri Garhwal District) for irrigation and hydroelectric generation. An annual festival of Ganga Dussehra is organised on its banks annually during the months of September and October at Chaubari village near Bareilly. It has a drainage basin of 30,641 km2. (11,831 sq.mi). = Course = The Ramganga River originates in the southern slopes of Dudhatoli Hill in Pauri Garhwal District of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The source of the river, known as \\"Diwali Khal\\", is located in Gairsain tehsil at . The river flows by the town of Gairsain, however the town is located at a much higher altitude than the river. The river then enters the Almora district of Kumaon through a deep and narrow valley in Chaukhutia tehsil. Emerging from there, it turns southwest and receives the Tadagatal River, wandering widely around the southeastern boundary of Lohabagarhi. It then proceeds further in the same direction and reaches Ganai, where it receives the Kharogad coming from Dunagiri from the left and Khetasargad coming from Pandnakhal from the right. Coming out of the Ganai, it flows towards the Talla Giwar region, where there is an open valley with alluvial land along and around the river, which is extensively cultivated and irrigated by the waters of the river. After Masi, the valley shrinks to some extent, but some fertile plains are still found up to the Briddhakedar temple. Here it receives the Vinod river, which originates from Chaukot, and from this point onwards the flow of the river turns southwards, and mountains filled with fertile soil and rocks can be seen on either sides of the river. Eleven miles further from Masi, it reaches Bhikiyasain, where it receives the Gagas from the east and Naurargad from the south. Here the valley widens once again, but irrigation still depends mainly on minor streams. From Bhikiyasain the river takes a sharp turn towards the west and receives Nail river from Salt and Devgad from Garhwal. It forms the boundary of Almora and Pauri Garhwal districts to some extent after the Marchula Bridge. The river then enters Bhabar and flows westward from Patli Dun into the Jim Corbett National Park. Ramganga, which is already a large river now, enters the plains at Kalagarh in Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh, where a dam has been constructed on the river for the purpose of irrigation and hydroelectric production. About 15 miles from here it is joined by the Khoh, after which it enters the Moradabad district, where on the alluvial lowlands it flows in a southeastern direction with a very rapid flow, and forms the boundary between Thakurdwara and Kanth tehsils. The Ramganga receives several tributaries in moradabad, almost all on its left bank, most of which are Tarai streams flowing towards south or south-west. The first among them is the Phika, which rises in the kumaon hills and joins the Ramganga near Surjannagar. The Khalia stream, which drains the north-western part of Thakurdwara joins the Ramganga at Daulatpur Tigri. After receiving the Dhela river, the Ramganga flows through the city of Moradabad, which is situated on its right bank, and receives the Rajera river near Dalpatpur. The river then continues further towards Rampur district, where it receives the Koshi river near Chamraul in Shahabad tehsil. It crosses Rampur with the same direction and strong currents as Moradabad and reaches Bareilly district. Ramganga river at Bareilly The Ramganga flows through the Bareilly district mainly in the southeastern direction. It receives the combined stream of Bhakra and Kichha (also called Baigul) from its left and the Gagan river from its right, after which it reaches near Bareilly city, which is located at a distance of about 10 km on its left side. Here it receives the Deoranian and Nakatiya rivers from its left - both rivers flow through Bareilly. An annual fair is held on the banks of the river on the occasion of Ganga Dussehra in Chaubari village near Bareilly in the month of September-October. Flowing further through Badaun and Shahjahanpur and Hardoi districts, it finally joins the Ganga river opposite Kannauj, after covering a total distance of about 373 miles.

Since 1996 he has been eparch in the Romanian Catholic Eparchy of St George's in Canton, the second to hold that position in the United States' sole Romanian Byzantine Catholic eparchy and the only Romanian Rite eparchy outside of Romania. Biserica Rom√¢nƒÉ UnitƒÉ cu Roma, Greco-CatolicƒÉ Biography Botean was born on July 9, 1955, in Canton, Ohio, to a Romanian-American couple, John and Amelia Botean (n√©e Popa). He has one younger brother, Mark S. Botean. He was ordained a priest on May 18, 1986. In 1993 he was appointed apostolic administrator for the diocese and then eparch on March 29, 1996. He was consecrated a bishop on August 24 that year by Archbishop Lucian Mure»ôan, assisted by co-consecrators Archbishop Judson Michael Procyk and Bishop Nicholas James Samra. As the second eparch in the history of a unique eparchy, a large part of Botean's activities consist of compliance work, bringing the organization into conformance with the requirements of his split jurisdiction, both American and Romanian. Most of his parishes long predate the creation of the eparchy, often by many decades. The first mission established during the lifetime of the diocese to be raised to the level of a parish was raised on June 29, 2008. In 2005 Botean established traditional Romanian Byzantine Catholic monasticism in the Diocese of Canton with the transfer of Holy Resurrection Monastery to diocesan jurisdiction. On October 17, 2006, the Holy Theophany Monastery for women (nuns) was established as a dependency of Holy Resurrection Monastery under the Botean's jurisdiction. In his 2003 Lent en pastoral letter, Botean spoke out against the Iraq War. The letter was a direct condemnation of the conflict, and termed it \\"objectively grave evil, a matter of mortal sin\\".Pastoral Letter Iraq War.pdf Iraq War pastoral letter , at the Center for Christian Non-violence; retrieved November 7, 2007 This was the most outspoken language used by a United States Catholic bishop or eparch about the war.Carl Olson, \\"Brumley Responds to Bishop Botean\\" , in Envoy Magazine, March 21, 2003; retrieved November 7, 2007 No other United States ordinary directly condemned the Iraq war. On June 28, 2008, Botean called the eparchial assembly to meet. It was the first serious effort to convoke the eparchial assembly in conformance with the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (Canons 235-242) during Botean's episcopacy. This preliminary session focused on organizing issues. At that meeting the practice of yearly assemblies was announced, and the next was held at St. Basil's in Trenton, New Jersey, in June 2009. Botean is a member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and also the Romanian Catholic Synod. He is in the unusual position of being directly answerable to the Pope and not to his synod. This odd position is a consequence of the very real modern development of understanding between viewing the Church as one with different rites within it and the Universal Church uniting 24 different sui iuris churches. The present situation of the eparchy is a midpoint between the two, within the newly formed Romanian synod and within the USCCB, but not answerable either.

A collected edition of the arc was released on November 14, 2007. Plot =Part I (Issue #1)= Buffy is leading a squad of Slayers‚Äîincluding three named Leah, Rowena, and Satsu‚Äîin a raid on a large, dilapidated church protected by a forcefield. She reveals that there are at least 1800 Slayers now active, 500 of whom are working with the Scooby Gang spread over ten squads. There are two Slayers posing as decoys of her, lest she become an easy target; one literally underground and another in Rome publicly partying and dating the Immortal. Working with Xander, who is running things at Slayer headquarters in Scotland (Buffy refers to him as a Watcher despite his objections) with a team of computer workers, psychics and mystics, including a Slayer named Renee, Buffy and her squad find three monstrous demons. There are also three dead humans. The demons are killed in battle. The humans have odd symbols carved in their chest and there are nearby automatic weapons. Buffy tells Xander to send a copy of the symbol to Giles, when another Slayer finds the machine that generated the force field, also presumably belonging to the victims. There is a shadowed spy nearby. In Sunnydale, General Voll of the United States Army surveys the crater left after the collapse of the Hellmouth, calling the Slayers a threat to the United States government and likening their squads to terrorist cells. A government expedition is being led sixty feet under the Hellmouth, but is cut short when one of the exploratory members encounters something. Buffy takes a break from studying the symbol to talk to Dawn. She is now giant-size; the others believe it was because her ex-boyfriend is a 'Thricewise' but Dawn remains quiet on the topic. The two have been feuding since the destruction of Sunnydale. It is revealed the government is working with Amy Madison who wants to destroy the Slayers. Amy has an ally that Voll has captured. =Part II (Issue #2)= Giles and Buffy, in different locations, are both disappointed in the fighting techniques of the Slayers they are training. They encourage the groups to use teamwork. Buffy compliments the Slayer Satsu on her skills and hair. In Southern Italy, Andrew is outside with a group of Slayers. He tries to go with a lecture on combat techniques but is distracted with talk of Lando Calrissian. Xander wonders if Dawn has made herself giant sized to gain attention from her sister; Dawn splashes Xander in return. Elsewhere, General Voll and his assistant discuss possible plans to destroy Buffy and her Slayers, from Amy Madison to a nuclear bomb. It's revealed Voll has the same symbol as the victims Buffy found earlier. Buffy has a sexual dream concerning Xander, which segues into a demon crucifying her. Amy Madison tries to kill Buffy, but fails and is trapped inside the castle by magic. However, she succeeds in cursing her with a sleeping spell that can only be lifted by the kiss of true love; later established to be simply one who loves Buffy. Renee and another Slayer discuss the attraction the former is developing for Xander. Then kilted zombies attack, summoned by Amy. As the Slayers fight the zombies, both sides taking casualties, Buffy is visited in her dreams by a mysterious figure. Willow Rosenberg appears to force Amy to stop the zombies. =Part III (Issue #3)= The figure in the duster and red shirt is revealed to be Ethan Rayne, a former friend of Giles and chaos-worshipping sorcerer. He reveals that they are trapped within Buffy's dreamspace, the conglomeration of all of a person's possible dreams. Ethan urges Buffy to escape so she can help the battle raging outside. He gives hints about 'Twilight'. Amy Madison is defeated, but Buffy is still locked in a coma. Only a kiss from someone who loves her can free her. Willow commands all surrounding her to close their eyes. They do and someone kisses Buffy. She awakens with the cry of \\"Cinnamon Buns!\\". Giles contacts a demon of the same breed as those killed in Part 1, asking for information about the symbol found on the bodies. The demon insists that the symbol is meaningless to his kind. Xander warns Andrew and comforts Renee. Despite being subdued, Amy's magics transport Willow to an Army base; it is revealed Amy has allied herself with Warren Mears. =Part IV (Issue #4)= As he prepares to torture and mutilate Willow, Warren tells how Amy found and rescued him from death, she is now his 'skin'. Buffy's mystical allies will only be able to transport two back to the Army base. Buffy chooses Satsu and borrows her cinnamon lip gloss. When the portal is opened, Voll has already set up a high powered energy cannon to blast anyone on the other side of the wormhole. Fortunately for Buffy, Xander had already taken the necessary precautions by rigging a large mirror to reflect the energy blast back through the portal, destroying the cannon and leaving Voll's squad badly damaged and uncoordinated. Buffy and Satsu then appear through the opening. Slayer Scythe in hand and Satsu at her side, Buffy takes on the entire squad, mortally wounding many. This gives her the perfect leverage for the location of her friend, as Willow will be able to heal them. Willow is being lobotomized but mysterious elemental beings somehow manifest. They warn her that she cannot come back if she dies at Warren's hands. They inspire her to fight back. She goes 'dark' and frees herself. She slowly heals her own injuries. Willow also channels magical energy into Buffy. This and an illusion of Catherine Madison (Amy's body-stealing mother) allows Buffy's group to win, at least temporarily. Buffy learns they are two miles south of Sunnydale. She discovers Voll has slain Ethan Rayne and is a follower of the concept of 'Twilight', the recurring symbol supposedly means the end of the Slayer line. General Voll believes the Slayers will take power because their demonic-origins will corrupt them. Production Joss Whedon returns to the series four years after writing the television series' finale. Throughout the issues, he slips references to past episodes in the dialogue. Willow's comment \\"I'd like to test that theory\\" was first uttered by Giles in season six. Amy's reference that Willow attempted to end the world occurred in \\"Grave.\\" When Willow's hair turns black, Dawn questions her if she's evil again (\\"Villains.\\") Whedon also adds pop-culture references: Xander and Renee discuss Nick Fury, the fictional Marvel Comics character, who wears an eye patch similar to Xander's. Like Whedon, Georges Jeanty references past episodes as well as pop-culture in the artwork. In part 3, Buffy's inner psyche feature images of past characters and events. Such instances include The Master, her mother Joyce Summers, Angel, Faith, Caleb, Buffy's doodled notebook (\\"The Prom,\\") Joyce's corpse (\\"The Body,\\") and Buffy, Willow, Xander's high school graduation (\\"Graduation Day.\\") One image also features Joss Whedon himself. Finally, when Andrew is playing strip poker with the Slayers, one of the girls is reading Fray, the actual graphic miniseries by Joss Whedon comic about a future Slayer. Buffy later time travels to the future and meets Fray. Reception The resurrection of the series was both a critical and commercial success. Entertainment Weekly was quoted praising that \\"creator Whedon effectively sucks devotees back into his Hellmouth.\\" Elizabeth Anne Allen, who portrayed Amy in the television series commented favourably on the story, describing it as \\"awesome\\" and commenting that \\"[Season Six/Seven] was fun.... but I really would have loved to play Amy in Season 8. She is much darker.\\"SlayAlive Interview: Elizabeth Anne Allen, SlayAlive.com. Timing *Intended to be set after BtVS's seventh season. The story takes place \\"at least a year and a half\\" after the events of \\"Chosen\\", placing it at its earliest in the latter half of 2004 and after the events of \\"Not Fade Away\\". Canonical issues This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this arc, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel\\" continuity.Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007).

In 1998, she and her sister Hannah joined together and formed the group The Graaf Sisters, who became popular with the song \\"You Got What I Want Baby\\". She was also the wife of footballer Magnus Hedman and as a result has been voted the sexiest footballer's wife. Early years Graaf was born in Gothenburg, but she grew up in Kungs√§ngen in Stockholm County, to Swedish Pentecostal parents. In her late teens, Graaf became pregnant with her son Isak. Instead of burdening or embarrassing her religious parents, she married her Finnish gangster boyfriend Jorma whom she was already living with. During this time, she was physically and emotional abused. After Graaf was shot in the leg, she left her husband despite threats against her and her family. She eventually reported him to the proper authorities. As a result, she was placed under protective custody and given new identities. She and her son were moved throughout Sweden but eventually settled in Gothenburg and was given the new names of Michaela and Ville for her son. Her husband was eventually released from prison and he put a 50 000 SEK bounty on her and a reward for hurting her sister model, Hannah. After her husband's indictment, the police did little to help Graaf. She did receive some help from a policewoman who would eventually get fired for helping Graaf. To this day, Graaf has a bitter disdain for the Swedish authorities. Her plight eventually was heard by former MC gang leader who felt bad for her and decided to protect Graaf. Finally, Graaf had enough of hiding and returned home to her mother. Later her ex-husband decided to stop the harassment. Career = Modeling = Due to all the stress following the aftermath her ex-husband's indictment, Graaf lost a great deal of weight and suffered from lack of confidence. She underwent breast augmentation and started an exercise regimen. Her sister Hannah, an established model, took her to a celebrity party where she met E-Type who hit on her. She claims this boosted her confidence and being seen on the party scene with her sister landed her a modeling career. Graaf followed the footsteps of her younger sister and began glamour modeling. Graaf would often model with her sister Hannah. The two gained noterity for appearing in countless men's magazines. The controversy catapulted lesser known Graaf's career. She has appeared in the magazines Caf√©, Moore, and Slitz. In 1998, Graaf appeared on three separate Caf√© covers. In 2004, The Graaf were looking for a comeback. The sisters flew to Los Angeles and did a pictorial for FHM magazine. =Music= The Graaf sisters became a cultural phenomenon and, by 1998 both sisters gave up glamour modeling to pursue a music career. That same year, she formed a musical duo The Graaf Sisters with Hannah and was quickly signed to Sony BMG. The two worked with producers Christer Sandelin, Tommy Ekman, and Rob 'n' Raz. The record yielded the Swedish No. 1 hit \\"You Got (What I Want)\\". The duo has since been on hiatus with both women marrying and having children. In 2002, the sisters were involved in a civil suit against Mikael Brinkstierna. Brinkstierna alleged that the sisters began working with him in 1996 and that they had a management contract in which he was entitled to 25% of all revenues from the sisters' future disc sales. After the success of their first album, Brinkstierna received no money after he allegedly spent hours helping them be a success. The sisters claim that Brinkstierna gave them nothing but money and accused him of being a crook after a similar dispute Brinkstierna had with the pop group Aqua. =Author= In March 2006, Graaf released her biography Det ska bli ett sant n√∂je att d√∂da dig (\\"It is going to be a true pleasure to kill you\\"), where she tells about her childhood and her first, problematic marriage. The title of her book was the last thing her ex-husband Jorma said to her before she left him and fled with their son Isak. =Television= Graaf participated in the Swedish edition of Dancing with the Stars (Let's Dance) until the end of January 2009, when she was forced to quit due to a cerebral hemorrhage. She also works for Postkodlotteriet and gives the winners money, Postkodsmiljon√§ren where the main show is broadcast on TV4. Personal life In 1995, she gave birth to her first son, Isak, with her first husband. A year and a half after Isak's birth, Graaf left her husband in 1996. In 1999, Graaf married Swedish football goalkeeper Magnus Hedman. The couple had two sons named Lancelot (born in 2000) and Tristan (born in 2004). During their early marriage, the couple lived in the outskirts of Northampton, England, where Hedman was playing soccer in Celtic. After Hedman's retirement the couple resided in Stockholm. In 2006, Graaf separated from Hedman after news papers reported an alleged affair with singer Linda Bengtzing. The couple have since divorced. Her fourth son, Charlie, was born in 2011. Her oldest son Isak died in an accident on 25 August 2014. She gave birth to her fifth son Louie in 2016. Charity The Sisters made Time Magazine's List of European Heroes for their charity work. Magdalena along with Hannah have donated earnings from their modeling to aid orphanages in Nagpur in central India. The sisters maintain that they never have strayed too far from their Pentecostal upbringing and that their commitment for charity was inherited from their mother Linda Bergling who worked as a missionary in Asia and Africa. Not only have the donated money to the cause but they have built two orphanages and school. Magdelena's then husband, Magnus claimed Magdalena would constantly hit up his friends for donations at parties.

The Bombay Art Society is a 127-year-old institution founded for encouraging and promoting art. Most of the renowned artists on India's art scene have been associated with the Bombay Art Society in some way. The society boasts of a rich past though its members and there is no denying its historical context and it is against this that the Bombay Art Society's greatness can be best understood. thumb The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi at the Bombay Art Society, in Mumbai on February 13, 2016. The Governor of Maharashtra, Shri C. Vidyasagar Rao and the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis and other dignitaries are also seen History For some five or six years after the foundation of the Society in 1888, the Exhibits of the European Artists preponderated over those of the Indian Artists as shown by the catalogues of the Annual Exhibitions. This was natural as The Sir J.J. School of Art was then in its first stages of development, but in course of time as taste for the acquisition of art as a profession was developed under able Principals of the School of Art, like Messrs. Terry, and Griffiths, and by the publicity given to Indian Artists by the Bombay Art Society, the School of Art produced a band of Indian Artists, whose works can be compared most favourably with those of European Artists. The number of works by Indian Artists exhibited in subsequent years at the Society's Annual Exhibition later considerably increased and secured many medals and prizes. It was quite an achievement for Indian Artists under British Rule.  Advancements  The society has operated in the Jehangir Art Gallery since 1952, which is also the regular venue for the Society's Annual Exhibitions, thus faces difficulties in executing many of its ambitious plans like a permanent art gallery and an art library. During the Society's Centenary year in 1990 veteran artist and the then president of the Society K. K. Hebbar and the committee took the initiative for the complex. The Prime Minister then Shri Rajiv Gandhi through Maharashtra Government has gifted a piece of land in Bandra, Mumbai for the complex which is now ready. A number of awards and medals are given by the society. The prestigious Bendre-Husain Scholarship for encouraging and supporting the emerging artists instituted in 1989-90 was donated by legendary artist M.F. Husain. Recipients of the Roopadhar award for lifetime achievement include Sadanand Bakre (2004) and Tyeb Mehta (2007).What use awards?

A. Chandrasekhar. The film features Vijay and Sivaji Ganesan as the male leads, while Simran and Saroja Devi play their love interests. The film was a super hit at box office. The film was remade in Telugu as Daddy Daddy with Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Harish, and Raasi. Plot Vijay (Vijay) is a rich young business man, whose only one aim in life is to have fun, is the managing director of a big tea estate in Ooty and his company goes on a big loss because of his mismanagement. Vijay spends most of his time in partying and flirting with girls whenever he feels like. To manage the loss to his company, Vijay invites his father Rajashekar (who is in the United States) to come to India to sign some documents. Rajashekar dies in a plane crash on his way to India. Vijay's maternal uncle (Manivannan) comes up with the idea of having another elderly person to act as Vijay's father for a while until the documents are signed. So they visit a senior home, where they meet Selvam (Sivaji Ganesan) and they request him to act as Vijay's father. He agrees to it and starts to act as Vijay's father. Selvam observes the careless, take-it- easy life style of Vijay and is reminded of his old days when he used to be like Vijay. Selvam is very affectionate towards Vijay and he considers him as his son. Vijay finds out about Selvam's past life, that Selvam was married to Shantha (Saroja Devi) and they have been living separated for the past 34 years. He wants them to get united and he searches and finds the whereabouts of Shantha. Meanwhile, Kavitha (Simran) joins Vijay's company and she talks to Vijay in his own style. Vijay is knocked out by Kavitha's beauty and he falls in love with her. Then, their love gets into trouble because of Kavitha's mother. Now, Vijay tries to unite Selvam and Shantha. In return Selvam tries to unite Vijay and Kavitha. Kavitha first tries to kill Vijay to avenge her sister Anju, who committed suicide due to Vijay rejecting her love for him. But through Vijay's maternal uncle and Selvam, she understands Vijay's good heart and unites with him. Also, Selvam and Shantha meet once again and get married 'Once More'.

M. Lewin & Sons Limited, commonly known as TM Lewin, is a British online menswear retailer. It was started in 1898 by Thomas Mayes Lewin who opened his first shop on London's Panton Street and later moved to Jermyn Street, renowned as a base for formal shirts. TM Lewin started out making shirts but later started to sell suits, outerwear, knitwear, jackets, chinos, ties and accessories for men. By 2020, it had over 150 stores worldwide. Headquartered in Farringdon, in the London Borough of Islington, the company is majority owned by Stonebridge Capital. The company went into administration on 30 June 2020, closing its 66 UK stores. Stonebridge bought the company's assets in a pre- pack deal. History =19th century= The business was founded by Thomas Mayes Lewin on London's Panton Street in 1898, before moving to Jermyn Street in 1903. Lewin has been credited with popularising the modern, button-front shirt. Before that, men pulled shirts on over their heads. =20th century= During the 1900s, Thomas Mayes developed a reputation for design and quality among London's gentlemen. In 1903, Mr Lewin's ‚Äúcoat shirt‚Äù was described as a ‚Äúnovel idea‚Äù in London Opinion and Today. During World War I, TM Lewin supplied the RAF and British Army with uniform. TM Lewin was for a time a partnership between Thomas Mayes Lewin and Geoffrey James Lewin, operating from 39 Panton Street in London. Following retirement, the partnership was dissolved from 1 January 1938, the business continuing as TM Lewin and Sons Ltd. In 1978, the McKenna family bought TM Lewin. In 1980, future MD Geoff Quinn joined, and helped grow the company so that it had its first ¬£1m year in 1982. In 1993, the company started an early mail order facility and began moving production from its factory in Southend-on-Sea overseas into Europe. =21st century= 2000 saw TM Lewin open its fifth store (at Ludgate Circus in London) and start testing its promotional offers, something that would become a defining characteristic of the brand. It was also awarded the GQ magazine award for 5* shirt. In 2005, TM Lewin branched out from shirts and started making suits. In the same year, it supplied the ties for the London 2012 Olympic Bid and introduced the 4 for ¬£100 deal. By 2011, TM Lewin had 100 UK stores and outlets and, a year later, it launched its first overseas store (excluding Dublin) in Sydney, Australia. Following a 2015 deal with Bain Capital, Sven Gaede took over as CEO in 2018. In April 2020, the company began talks with potential buyers, as the COVID-19 pandemic jeopardised the retailer's operations. It was reported that rival menswear retailer Charles Tyrwhitt was among a number of parties which submitted offers for TM Lewin. Bain Capital ‚Äì the private equity group that has been supporting TM Lewin since 2015 through its debt investment arm ‚Äì was keen to sell the heritage menswear retailer and enlisted corporate finance firm Alantra to conduct an auction. On 13 May 2020, TM Lewin was acquired by Torque Brands, a vehicle of private equity firm Stonebridge Capital. Around 650 of TM Lewin's 700-strong employees were furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme of the UK government, while the stores remain temporarily closed throughout the pandemic. The 50 unfurloughed employees were active in digital operations and supply chain for TM Lewin. On 30 June 2020, TM Lewin announced the closure of all of its 66 UK shops and the redundancy of 600 workers.Coronavirus: TM Lewin to close all UK shops (1 July 2020), BBC News. Retrieved: 2 July 2020. Stonebridge bought back the brand's remaining assets, including its online business, in a pre-pack deal after concluding TM Lewin was no longer viable in its current format. Campaigns In 2017, Gary Lineker signed up to be the face of TM Lewin. This partnership continued in 2018 and 2019. TM Lewin has collaborated with several sporting events and teams including Royal Ascot, Harlequins (rugby), and the England and Wales Cricket Board. Stores As of 2019, the company owned 68 stores in the United Kingdom, and 89 based internationally, including in Ireland, Australia, the United States and across Europe.

It contains both the town's main public hall (formerly known as Hamilton Town Hall) and public library, as well as various council departments including licensing and community learning. It is a Category B listed building. History The old Town Hall at New Cross The first town house in Hamilton, which contained the council chamber, the courthouse and the jail, was built adjoining the old tolbooth at the junction of Castle Street and Palace Grounds Road and completed in 1798. The council considered making alterations to the ageing tolbooth and town house complex in 1860, but in the event decided to augment their facilities with a new public hall, known as the \\"town hall\\" at New Cross (now the corner of Duke Street and Quarry Street) in 1861. After the condition of the town hall at New Cross also deteriorated, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built complex which combined the functions of council chamber and public hall in one place: the site they selected was open land at the corner of Cadzow Street and Lower Auchingramomt Road. The new building, although appearing to be one, was actually built in stages over a 21-year period. The library section of the complex was designed by Alexander Cullen and opened by Andrew Carnegie in 1907. The adjacent townhouse offices were also designed by Alexander Cullen and officially opened by King George V on 9 July 1914. The town hall was designed by Cullen Lochhead and Brown and completed in 1928. The design involved a symmetrical frontage with seventeen bays facing Cadzow Street with the end bays, each with domed octagonal towers, projecting forward; the central section featured a wide doorway flanked by Doric order columns and pilasters on the ground floor; there was a wrought- iron balcony and a tall round-headed window flanked by Ionic order pilasters on the first floor with a segmental pediment above containing a carved coat of arms. Internally, the principal room was the main public hall with seating capacity for 700 people. The townhouse was the seat of government of the burgh of Hamilton until the council offices in Almada Street were completed in 1963. In 2002, each section of the building was closed to enable the building to undergo a regeneration project, costing ¬£9 million, to proceed. This was required to bring the internal facilities to current standards and restore the crumbling stone exterior of the building. The restored facility was made available to the public in August 2004 and an official opening by Princess Anne took place in September 2004. The library has won two awards: the \\"Architect Meets Practicality Award\\" for libraries of significant architectural interest that are practical and user-friendly and the \\"Mary Finch Accessibility Award\\" for the library which most addresses access issues from physical through to cultural barriers. The was restoration also recognised with a Scottish Civic Trust commendation.

TCI makes long‚Äêterm investments in companies globally. The management company is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority. Its holding company is TCI Fund Management Limited, based in the Cayman Islands, an offshore tax haven. Like most hedge funds, TCI requires investors to commit their capital for multi-year periods. This long-term horizon allows the fund greater flexibility when trading and investing capital independent of any potential ad hoc time constraints. Charity TCI derives its name from a charitable foundation called The Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), set up by Chris Hohn and his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn. In an example of \\"venture philanthropy\\", CIFF initially received a portion of TCI‚Äôs profits and other donations. CIFF focuses on improving the lives of children living in poverty in developing countries, and has grown to be one of the largest charities in the United Kingdom. After suffering a 43% loss during the 2008 calendar year, as of July 2009 the previous financial year had seen a rebound of over 70% profit and revenue for TCI. Through changes set in motion in 2012, the fund and foundation were split up. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do so on a discretionary basis. Investor activism TCI has a reputation for aggressive shareholder activism.Businessweek‚ÄîA Little Fund With Big Demands TCI has been a major shareholder of the German stock exchange Deutsche B√∂rse where it forced the resignation of the CEO after he refused to abandon his plan to take over the London Stock Exchange. In 2007, after acquiring 1% of the shares of major Dutch bank ABN AMRO, TCI led an attack demanding the bank split up or sell to the highest bidder to produce shareholder value.NRC Handelsblad (Dutch Newspaper), February 22, 2007 ABN was ultimately split and sold to Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Fortis, and Banco Santander and was a major contributing factor in the downfall of both RBS and Fortis. In June 2007, TCI failed in its attempt to get the Japanese utility J-Power, in which it had acquired a 10% stake, to boost its dividend. The general meeting of shareholders rejected the proposal, prompting a severe selloff in the stock. In 2006, as a shareholder of both Mittal Steel Company and Arcelor, TCI supported Mittal Steel in the company's unsolicited takeover offer for Arcelor. TCI initiated legal action against the Government of India using provisions in the bilateral trade treaty between United Kingdom and India regarding the under pricing of coal by Coal India Limited, in which TCI holds a 1% stake. In 2008 The US railroad company CSX won a court case against the Children‚Äôs Investment Fund and 3G Capital Partners, another hedge fund, after the funds announced that they had acquired about 20% of CSX‚Äôs stock. TCI succeeded in electing four of its five directors to the CSX board, but CSX shares declined by about 50 percent after the meeting. TCI declared defeat and sold its shares, taking its directors off the board. Chris Hohn, the founder of TCI vowed to abandon shareholder activism as an investing strategy. When the case was appealed, the judge gave limited support for the original finding. In 2008 the company was suffering from heavy losses but recovered very well and assets under management reportedly stood around $6 billion. At the end of 2010, the company recorded a loss of 80% in profits as a result of reduced investment performance. By 2020 the hedge fund was managing more than $30 billion. It recorded a 41% gain in 2019 after gaining just 0.9% in 2018.

Life  Abert was born in Stuttgart, the son of Johann Josef Abert (1832-1915), the Hofkapellmeister of that city. From 1890 to 1896 he studied classical philology at the Universities of T√ºbingen, Berlin and Leipzig. While at T√ºbingen he joined the Akademische Gesellschaft Stuttgardia, a student fraternity which shaped the political views of the liberalism in southern Germany. His philological studies ended in 1896 at Halle, where he had done work on Ancient Greek music. For the next three years he studied music theory at Berlin. In 1902 he qualified as lecturer by presenting his thesis on music of the Middle Ages at the University of Halle. Abert stayed on at Halle as a lecturer, becoming a senior lecturer (or associate professor) in 1910 and a full professor in 1918. In this capacity he moved the next year to the University of Heidelberg. But after just one year, Abert took up a post at Leipzig and in 1920 he became the successor of the music theorist Hugo Riemann. In 1923 he was called to the University of Berlin, where he was seen as the most suitable successor to Hermann Kretzschmar, also a music theorist. It was there that he worked with Friedrich Blume, Rudolf Gerber, Hans Hoffmann and Theodor Schwartzkopff, on the illustrated Dictionary of Music which was discovered to contain plagiarisms of Alfred Einstein's Neues Musiklexikon und Hugo Riemann Musiklexikon. Frankfurter Zeitung. 11 August 1928. In 1925 he was admitted to the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the first music theorist to be granted this honour.

In 1977, the then-municipality of Sint-Maria-Oudenhove ceased to exist when merged with the municipalities of Zottegem and Brakel. As a result, the part of Sint-Maria- Oudenhove which was merged with Brakel was ceded to the Arrondissement of Oudenaarde. Municipalities The Administrative Arrondissement of Aalst consists of the following municipalities: * Aalst * Denderleeuw * Erpe-Mere * Geraardsbergen * Haaltert * Herzele * Lede * Ninove * Sint-Lievens-Houtem * Zottegem Aalst ","title":"Arrondissement of Aalst"},{"id":"9669861","text":"The Dra≈°koviƒá, also spelled Draskovich in English, is a Croatian noble family, supposedly descended from an old Croatian noble tribe of Kr≈°elac, Stupiƒá or Poletƒçiƒá, while others considered the Mogoroviƒá family but it is less likely because they had a different coat of arms. There is no reliable data on the family before the 15th century. The first reliable information is provided by three documents written in Glagolitic alphabet in 1490 (mentioning \\"35 noblemen of the Dra≈°koviƒá family\\" from 18 families), kept at the Budapest National Archives. In the 15th century, they owned an estate in Donje Zaziƒçno (today's Donje Pazari≈°te) in the Bu≈°ka parish and around Knin in Dalmatia, which is why Bartol, who started the family's noble line, was in a document from 1520, referred to as \\"Kninjanin\\" (\\"from Knin\\"). In the first half of the 16th century, due to the Turkish threat, Bartol left Zaziƒçno and moved to the Kolpa river valley in Croatia proper. He fathered cardinal Juraj I Ga≈°par who was made a baron in 1567 and given Trako≈°ƒáan Castle in 1569. After that, the family members were referred to as \\"Trako≈°ƒáanski\\" (\\"from or of Trako≈°ƒáan\\"). The Dra≈°koviƒá family also occupied the Klenovnik Castle, the largest in Croatia before renovating Trako≈°ƒáan in the mid-19th century. Klenovnik still stands as a hospital. Notable members From the 16th to the 19th century, several family members became renowned in Croatia as politicians, army leaders, and religious dignitaries. * Juraj II Dra≈°koviƒá (1525‚Äì1585) was trained for priesthood in Krak√≥w, Vienna, Bologna, and Rome. He made a good career as a religious dignitary, and considerably added to the family fortune. In 1557, he was made bishop of P√©cs and, in 1563, of Zagreb. As of 1576, he was the Croatian ban (Viceroy). By the end of his life, he was made a cardinal. He left behind several tractates, as well as a collection of sermons and speeches in manuscript. * Ivan I Dra≈°koviƒá, a younger brother of Juraj, was a commander of Croatian and Hungarian forces under the supreme command of Nikola IV Zrinski defending Szigetv√°r from the Turks in 1566. * Ivan II Dra≈°koviƒá was a nephew of Juraj and Ivan I, his mother was Caterina Sz√©kely, defended Turopolje from the Turks in 1570. He was the Ban of Croatia between 1595 and 1608. * Ivan III Dra≈°koviƒá (1603‚Äì1648). His mother was √âva Istv√°nffy. He studied philosophy in Graz and law in Bologna. In 1640, he became the Croatian viceroy (ban). He led victorious battles against the Turks, and was particularly concerned with fortifying burgs and Croatian military border fortifications, which is why he was called \\"defensor Croatiae\\". At the assembly held in 1646 in the Hungarian town of Pozsony (Po≈æun in Croatian, now Bratislava in Slovakia), he was made the highest Hungarian national dignitary. He was the only Croatian who had this honour during the Habsburgs' rule. * Ivan V Dra≈°koviƒá, was Ban of Croatia from 17 February 1732 to his death on 4 January 1733. * Josip Kazimir Dra≈°koviƒá, general, was the son of Ban Ivan V Dra≈°koviƒá. His marriage to a noblewoman of lower descent hurt his brilliant military career and made it impossible for him to advance as ban. He played a particularly important role in the seven-year war (1756‚Äì1763). * Janko Dra≈°koviƒá (1770‚Äì1856), was a national reformer and politician. He was very broadly educated, and even considered as the best educated person in Croatia at the turn of the 18th century. His best known piece is Disertacija or \\"Tractate\\", published in Karlovac in 1832. It was the first political pamphlet written in ≈†tokavian dialect. Disertacija is the political, economic, and cultural programme of the Illyrian movement. In 1842, he gave a programmatic speech on the occasion of Matica ilirska's (the local cultural and publishing society's) establishment, as its first chairman. He dedicated all of his energy to his political activity and to the battle against pro-Hungarians. His Disertacija was translated into German in 1834. He also wrote poetry. * Juraj V Dra≈°koviƒá, as Major-General, he fought with Radetzky, and later also with Ban Jelaƒçiƒá. He was an MP, and one among the founders of the then Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. He started making calotypes already in 1848, his collection being one among the earliest and best preserved of its kind in the country. * Karlo Dragutin Dra≈°koviƒá (1873‚Äì1900) was an amateur photographer. After finishing high school in Zagreb, he studied law and technology in Budapest. He became engaged in photography in 1892. In 1895, he became a member of the Wiener Camera Club. There are several hundred of his negatives, prints, and slides preserved from the 1894-1899 period. Particularly interesting are those recording fast movements. He was one among the most pronounced 19th-century amateur photographers. * Julijana Dra≈°koviƒá (1847‚Äì1901), her paintings may today be found mostly in Trako≈°ƒáan. Along with her brothers Rudolf and Stjepan, and son Karlo, she was also engaged in amateur photography. * Maria Dra≈°koviƒá of Trako≈°ƒáan (1904‚Äì1969) was the first wife of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria, head of the House of Wittelsbach and pretender to the Kingdom of Bavaria from 1955 to 1996, as well the jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France. She was the mother of dukes Franz and Max.

It is a direct sequel of the 1979 movie The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid and is also known under the title Why Did You Pick on Me? Plot Following the events of The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid, Sheriff Hall and H7-25 (using the official identity of Charlie Warren) still get no rest from the military: because the little alien has not yet grasped the meaning of keeping a low profile, they are constantly on the move, and H7-25's father has had to pick them out of a tight spot too many times already. Hall and Charlie eventually arrive at the city of Munroe, where petty crime, from vandalism to armed robberies, is running rampant, more so because the town currently has no sheriff. Charlie pushes Hall into staying in this place, and somewhat reluctantly Hall takes up the job in this chaotic place, with the help of the local radio jock and City Mayor Howard (Ferruccio Amendola). Soon the riff-raff in town learns not to underestimate the new sheriff as he metes out hard-hitting advice to stay out of trouble. However, the local thugs turn out to be the smallest of Hall's problems. A task force of hostile alien invaders are preparing to enslave mankind with the use of hypno-wave devices and advanced androids; already they control the local authorities and military installations. Charlie immediately senses the true nature of these individuals, however, and after much persuasion convinces his big friend to look into the matter. But this arouses the suspicion of the alien leader (Claudio Undali); he has Hall arrested for snooping into matters of national security and Charlie kidnapped. Hall manages to sneak out of prison, and after Howard has told him what happened to Charlie, the sheriff decides to take up the fight. Through the public announcement system Howard appeals to the citizens of Munroe for help, and the thugs and hooligans whom Hall has previously thrashed join forces with the sheriff, just as the alien leader executes the final stage of his plan to take over Munroe by sending the local state police force to a festival and round up the townspeople. Hall and his helpers engage the officers in a massive fist-fight and begin to win the upper hand until the alien chief decides to use his hypno-wave machine. The rioters are quickly subjugated, except for the sheriff, who wanders as if in trance to the military base which serves as the alien's headquarters. As Hall arrives there, the alien leader and his androids discover that their hypno- waves have no effect on the sheriff (due to an earlier treatment by Charlie's wonder device). The androids are sent against Hall, but the sheriff's fists prove to be tougher than they are, and the androids' neural nets quickly end up thoroughly scrambled. The alien leader tries to activate a self-destruct device, but the sheriff takes a swing at him and he shatters like glass. Charlie is released from captivity and happily rejoins the sheriff. However, as the town celebrates their rescuers, the military arrives to try and apprehend Charlie once more. Fed up with the constant pestering, Hall and Charlie take off into space with the old-timer automobile they were riding at the parade to join Charlie's family. But as soon as they have left the atmosphere, a small inconvenience makes Hall grumble once more: \\"Why does everything happen to me!\\"  Cast  *Bud Spencer as Sheriff Scott Hall *Cary Guffey as H7-25 (Charlie Warren) *Ferruccio Amendola as Phil Howard *Robert Hundar as Aliens Boss *John Bartha as Police Chief *Carlo Reali as Lt.

It was first published in 1899 and is one of the most popular and widely recognized novels in Hungary. Background Cover of the first edition The story is set in the first half of the 16th century and covers a period of roughly 25 years. The main historical events that are addressed are the bloodless occupation of Buda, the seat of the Hungarian kings, in 1541, and the 1552 Siege of Eger (now in Northern Hungary) by the Turks that forms the major topic of the novel. The story also addresses some other historical topics like the impact of the Reformation, the discord between Hungarians and the Holy Roman Emperor, as well as many themes of general import like mercy, filial and marital love, friendship, trust and truthfulness. Most characters of the book are historical figures, notably the hero Gergely Bornemissza himself, though most of them have been strongly romanticized according to the author's intentions. Gergely's life story in the novel is almost fully invented, except for his role as an officer during the siege of Eger. √âva Cecey, Gergely's love and later wife, is fictional; her portrayal in the novel is based on G√°rdonyi's \\"ideal woman\\".Introduction to Corvus edition Plot summary The novel consists of five parts that tell the life of Gergely Bornemissza from the age of eight until the year 1552, when he is in his early thirties. I. Gergely is a half-orphan and son of a poor woman, while √âva Cecey is the daughter of a landowner. They are nevertheless playmates. While playing in the woods, the two children are captured by a Turk named Jumurdzs√°k and have to join a trek of prisoners. Due to the cunning of little Gergely, the two children are able to escape and later also to free the other prisoners. Gergely's mother dies in a raid by the Turks, but the little boy is adopted as a foster son by the rich aristocrat B√°lint T√∂r√∂k, where he gets a good education. II. Several years later, Gergely has to experience that Buda is captured by the Turks through deceit and his foster father B√°lint T√∂r√∂k is led away prisoner. Gergely meets √âva again, who has become a pretty young girl. III. Gergely learns that √âva who is an excellent rider and fighter is to be married to the cowardly Adam F√ºrjes at the request of the queen. They flee together and get married. Together with some friends they plan to free B√°lint T√∂r√∂k from his prison in Istanbul. They go to the Ottoman city, but despite many adventures, they finally fail in freeing the Hungarian aristocrat. IV. It is 1552, a force about 200,000 Turks is approaching the little town of Eger, the citadel of which is only defended by 2000 soldiers. Istv√°n Dob√≥, captain of the citadel, calls on the troops of the emperor for aid, but no-one arrives. Gergely joins the forces who are preparing to fight in Eger, while leaving √âva home with their little son. Shortly after he has left, a stranger arrives and kidnaps the little boy. √âva realizes that the stranger must have been the Turk Jumurdzs√°k. She understands that there must be a connection with the siege of Eger, so she masquerades as a man and tries to enter the besieged castle. V. Even though the forces of the Turks are overwhelming, the Hungarians in Eger are able to defend themselves. Eger's strong walls and the high morale of its defenders allows the fortress to withstand five major assaults and continuous cannon fire - almost 12,000 cannonballs land inside the fortress before the siege ended. In a stroke of unparalleled ingenuity, Bornemissza devises primitive but lethal grenades and powder keg sized bombs to use against the attackers, as well as a water-mill wheel packed with gunpowder which he rolls into the Ottoman ranks. √âva finally arrives at Eger. Though the Ottomans attack again and again, the citadel stands firm, with also the women of Eger joining the battle. Finally, the Ottoman forces withdraw. Gergely's and √âva's little son is exchanged for a Turkish boy who has been captured, and the family is finally reunited.

This syndrome is particularly associated with pancreatic, gastric and lung cancer and Trousseau's syndrome can be an early sign of cancer sometimes appearing months to years before the tumor would be otherwise detected. Heparin therapy is recommended to prevent future clots. The Trousseau sign of malignancy should not be confused with the Trousseau sign of latent tetany caused by low levels of calcium in the blood. History Armand Trousseau first described this finding in the 1860s; he later found the same sign in himself, was subsequently diagnosed with gastric cancer and died soon thereafter. Trousseau presciently attributed thromboembolism in malignancy to changes in blood composition rather than local inflammatory or mechanical forces. By correlating clinical observation with surgical and autopsy findings, Trousseau recognized that a localized cancer could induce a generalized hypercoagulable state in which thrombosis could occur elsewhere in the body, such as in extremities with visceral malignancy. Trousseau described several cases in which recurrent thrombosis was the presenting feature of visceral cancer, and his confidence in the utility of this connection led him to say, \\"So great, in my opinion, is the semiotic value of phlegmasia in the cancerous cachexia, that I regard this phlegmasia as a sign of the cancerous diathesis as certain as sanguinolent effusion into the serous cavities.\\" Pathophysiology Some malignancies, especially gliomas (25%), as well as adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and lung, are associated with hypercoagulability (the tendency to form blood clots) for reasons that are incompletely understood, but may be related to factors secreted by the tumors, in particular a circulating pool of cell-derived tissue factor-containing microvesicles. Some adenocarcinomas secrete mucin that can interact with selectin found on platelets, thereby causing small clots to form. In patients with malignancy-associated hypercoagulable states, the blood may spontaneously form clots in the portal vessels, the deep veins of the extremities (such as the leg), or the superficial veins anywhere on the body. These clots present as visibly swollen blood vessels (thrombophlebitis), especially the veins, or as intermittent pain in the affected areas.

The Constitution gives the federal government primary responsibility for dealing with tribes. Some scholars divide the federal policy toward Indians in six phases: coexistence (1789‚Äì1828), removal and reservations (1829‚Äì1886), assimilation (1887‚Äì1932), reorganization (1932‚Äì1945), termination (1946‚Äì1960), and self-determination (1961‚Äì1985).David R.

The U.S. Indian policy was riddled with fraud. Here a peace commissioner offers torn (\\"ventilated\\") blankets, an empty rifle case, and 50 sides of spoiled beef, Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper of 18 September 1873 The Nonintercourse Act of 1790 marked the beginning of the Trade and Industrial era. This act established that no sales of Indian lands were to be made between any persons or states unless the sale was authorized by the United States. The United States federal government was then granted management of trade and diplomatic relations that involved Indians and their lands. The main goal of establishing the Trade and Industrial Act was to keep peace on the frontier and avoid war with the Natives. During the Trade and Industrial Era, the Natives were also included within the United States government, to some degree, by the establishment of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the War Department in 1824. However, land disputes and law jurisdiction cases began to appear frequently in the United States Supreme Court. It was concluded that \\"discovery also gave the discoverer the exclusive right to extinguish Indian title either by 'purchase or by conquest'.\\" Natives were recognized only as occupants of the land, and not owners. Treaties Indiana Indian treaties The federal government was in charge of relations with the Indians, and the procedure was to use the treaty making power of the president and the Senate to make formal arrangements. Over 200 treaties were agreed upon by 1840. Gatlin argues that treaties established a procedure that benefited both parties. The federal government was primarily interested in guaranteeing that Indian lands did not fall into private hands, and that it handled all negotiations with the tribes. These negotiations, says Gatlin, strengthened the tribes sense of unity and leadership. The land sales gave the Indians a steady flow of income, and guarantees of federal financial, medical, and educational aid.Jay Gatlin, Private Diplomacy to Private Property: States, Tribes and Nations in the Early National Period,\\" Diplomatic History (1997) 22:1 pp 85-99 Many of the treaties remain in effect and are of special importance regarding federal recognition of tribal status, hunting and fishing rights, rights to protection of sacred properties, rights to water and minerals, and land claims.Alexandra Harmon, ed., The Power of Promises: Rethinking Indian Treaties in the Pacific Northwest (2008)Charles E.

Bernholz, \\"American Indian treaties and the Supreme Court: A guide to treaty citations from opinions of the United States Supreme Court,\\" Journal of Government Information (2004) 30#2/3 pp 318-431 Westward expansion and Indian relocation During the early 19th century, as the eastern settlers of the United States felt the desire to explore westward, the natives were caught in the middle of things. Eastern Indian tribes were forced out of their homelands to barren areas that contained fruitless soils, though they had a prosperous relationship beforehand. The reason given to justify the Indian removal stated by Thomas Jefferson was to, \\"give them a space to live undisturbed by white people as they gradually adjust to civilized ways\\". Though a problem occurred where westward expansion was on the rise and areas in the west were becoming full with settlers and the lands that Natives resided on (Nebraska and Kansas territories) ended up being taken from them by the government and given to settlers. Treaties were signed by the natives of the area, stating they accepted the downsized reservations or allotments, although their allotments were usually sold to the white settlers by force. The outcome of this removal devastated the Natives, and cost them their tribal identity and independence. Allotment and assimilation era (1887‚Äì1943) In 1887, the United States Congress passed the General Allotment Act, which is considered one of the earliest attempts aimed toward assimilation of Native tribes. This act intended to give Natives a sense of land ownership as well as integrate an agricultural lifestyle with the tribes, much like that of the Americans and Europeans. Under the General Allotment Act, tribal lands were no longer under the control of tribal governments; instead, the land was under the control of individual land owners. This period of allotment over tribal lands became known as the \\"allotment and assimilation era\\", mainly because the main goal of allotting tribal land was to Americanize Native peoples into mainstream society. The notion that Native peoples could live their lives according to traditional practices and teachings on the reservation was forbidden; thus, assimilation became the epitome of federal Indian policy. The BIA was used during this time to keep a commanding hold of all aspects of Native life, thus upholding the goal of \\"civilizing\\" natives. The Allotment era resulted in the loss of over two thirds of tribally entrusted lands from 138 million acres (558,000 km¬≤) in 1871 to 48 million acres (190,000 km¬≤) in 1934. This was mainly due to leasing, and eventually selling, tribal lands to white settlers. Allotment did not work, because it was not something Indians were used to. They did not view the land as something to own. Instead, they viewed it as their home. Termination and relocation (1945‚Äì1960) Between the end of the Franklin D. Roosevelt era and the beginning of the John F. Kennedy administration, less traditional Native Americans, congressional leaders, and government administrators, developed a policy that they hoped would integrate the Indian population with mainstream America. To this end, they enacted laws to terminate the government's trusteeship of Indian lands and relocate Indians to the nation's cities. They believed that once Indians left the reservation, they would have opportunities for education, employment and assimilation. Tribal self-determination era In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy wanted the Indian tribes to be recognized as independent nations governing themselves. He promised the Indian tribes that treaties made prior to 1960 would be recognized by the federal government and that their rights as Indian people would be protected. This was realized when the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was passed in 1971. The ANCSA allowed for the Alaskan Natives to be given of land, federal payments of 462.5 million dollars over eleven years, and another 500 million dollars to help with mineral development in Alaska. All this was in exchange for the Alaskans giving up their claim to the land. The act also allowed the Alaskan tribe to have freedom from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In the 1960s, there were many acts passed, geared to helping the Indian tribes. Indian tribes benefited greatly from these because it gave them rights within both the tribal and federal government. In 1968, the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 was passed. It recognized the Indian tribes as sovereign nations with the federal government. In the 1970s, one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed through Congress. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 allowed tribes to have more tribal control over federally subsidized programs for Indians. Another important act passed by Congress was the Indian Child Welfare Act, passed in 1978, which granted tribal government jurisdiction over child custody and adoption on the reservation.
