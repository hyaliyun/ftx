Early life Arlethia Gertrude Fitch, better known by her childhood nickname, Ollie, was born on September 14, 1880 in Stauton, Virginia to Elizabeth Davidsen and William Fitch. The couple also had an elder daughter, Pearl (born 1875/1877). Alethia's parents never seemed to have married, as 23-year old Ms. Davidsen was listed in the 1880 US Census as a single mother, with housework listed as her source of income and residing at 138 Jackson Alley with her infant daughter, Arlethia. In February 1892, shortly after the death of William Fitch, Ms. Davidsen and her daughters relocated north to Brooklyn, where her mother, Ellen Davidsen and sister Mamie were living. In 1900, the Davidsen household, according to the 1900 Census, were residing in the comfortable Fort Greene neighborhood at 435 Carlton Avenue. Ms. Davidsen was employed as a domestic for a local white family and 19-year old Alethia, employed as a stenographer. Pearl, now 25 (or 23), lived in the nearby Clinton Hill neighborhood at 385 Clinton Avenue, where she was employed as a live-in servant for the Irish, O'Flyn family. Career =Florida Creole Girls (1902‚Äì1903)= During the summer of 1901, French actress, Nina Diva, wife of the Austrian millionaire Baron Erlanger organized the Fencing Musketeers (also known as the Fencing Octoroons and Les Mousquetaires Noirs) consisting of eleven black women, which after two months of rehearsing, opened at New York's Circle Theater (October 26, 1901). The show consisted of lead performer, Jennie Scheper (born 1877 in Washington DC), who had come from the Sons of Ham show. There was also, Bidie Hall (born 1882 in Dunkirk, NY), Edith Adams (born 1876 in Indianapolis), Pearl Hobson (born 1879 in Lisbon, VA), Mattie Stafford (born 1870 in Norfolk, VA), Minnie Brown (born 1884 in Chicago, Il), William H. Ward (born 1876 in Salisbury, MO), Jennie Ward and of course, Ollie as well as two other unnamed women. In January 1902, the show played Boston's Howard Theater (January 12‚Äì18) and New York's Garden Terrace. On February 5, 1902, the troupe departed from Philadelphia aboard the SS Belgenland, arriving 4‚Äì5 days later in Liverpool. By the time the show reached Europe, the show had lost member, now advertised as the 10 Fencing Musketeers Company. Early February through March, the toured across Germany, appearing in Bremen, Kiel and Hamburg. On April 14, while appearing in Copenhagen's Arenatheatret, the women applied for passports at the US Embassy. Later the women appeared in Stockholm's Svea-Teatern (May 1‚Äì5) and Budapest (June‚ÄìJuly). On July 5, while appearing in the Hungarian capital, the furious women attacked their manager for not paying as a much as they were promised. The fighting became so severe that Hungarian police had to intervene. Afterwards, the women reappeared that October in London, now managed by Geraldine de Grant, a German impresario who renamed them, Die 7 Florida Creols Girls sending them off to continue touring across the continent. The troupe later moved on to D√ºsseldorf's Apollotheater, Leipzig's Kristallpalast, Brussels, Amsterdam's Rembrandt Theater (November 24-December 9) and Rotterdam's Casino Variete. In January 1903, the troupe opened in Paris at the Casino de Paris (January 1-February 23), where they were praised for their extraordinary demonstration of the Cakewalk. So popular were the women, that they were photographed at Studio Wal√©ry, who distributed their photos as postcards for eager European and American tourists. During their sojourn in the French capital, the troupe quickly began to dissolve. Mattie Stafford quickly became a popular French attraction, Bidie Hall began her solo tour and Edith Hall probably returned to America. The remaining quartette, continued on with a month's engagement at Vienna's Ronacher Theater (March 7‚Äì31) and two weeks at Budapest's Municipal Orpheum Theater (Apr.1-15). In June, the troupe finally reached the vast expanses of Imperial Russia, appearing at a popular caf√©-chantant in Moscow. Unfortunately, in Russia, every theater is under the power of the police. Nothing can be said or done against their wishes, and if the wish to stop any performance, why they stop it, and that is all that there is to it. The police saw their first performance and allowed them to go on. However, after their tenth performance, the police have stopped them, saying that the American cake-walk was too suggestive. On July 4, the American Consul, Samuel Smith, invited all the American performers who were in Moscow to a celebration on the grounds of the consulate. The program included, the Manhattan Quartette, Smith & Doretto, Weston of loop the Hoopology, Miss Walcott, the Florida Creole Girls Quartette and Harry Houdini (who wrote about the women in his diary). Afterwards the troupe moved on to appear in St. Petersburg and Riga's Hagenstalna Wafaras Teatris (August 18‚Äì23). In October, the troupe were in London, appearing at the Royal Holborn Theatre before finally completely dissolving and the women joining Will Marion Cook's noted black musical comedy In Dahomey. Eventually, Minnie Brown returned to Germany and Jennie Scheper adopted the pseudonym, Madagascar Girl and departed for her own solo tour. =La Olliette (1904-1911)= At the beginning of 1904, as the Russo-Japanese War raged, Ollie and Pearl Hobson returned to St. Petersburg to pursue their solo careers. On April 15, she visited St. Petersburg's American Embassy and applied for a new passport. Immediately afterwards, she began traversing across the Russian Empire as a popular American variety artist around music- halls between St. Petersburg, Odessa and Moscow. On January 22, 1905, a large public demonstration outside of the Tsar's palace escalated into the Bloody Sunday riots. Chaos quickly ensued across the Imperial capital and soon across the Russian Empire. Throughout 1905, serfs and radicals took to the streets and engaged in armed struggle with soldiers and the gendarmerie, sailors of the Potemkin battleship mutinied at the Black Sea port of Odessa. Tsar Nikolai badly misjudged the Russo-Japanese War in the Far East, which soon lost public support and exposed the many weaknesses of the Russian military and political institutions. Defeat at the hands of 'inferior' Asians served to speed up public unrest that was becoming so serious that the Tsar was forced to end the war with the Treaty of Portsmouth on September 5, 1905. To overcome the heartbreak due to the loss of the war, St. Petersburg was overcome with forced gaiety, which Ollie joined in. Throughout the summer of 1906, violence raged throughout Russia, prompting many of the elite to flee to the comfort of their country homes. Soon, these same estates were being torched and pillaged nightly, sometimes entire villages would out for the looting. On the horizons, nobleman and their families could see the glow of fires and the cries of the savage mobs. Luckily, Ollie had escaped from the violence and chaos, traveling to Budapest in June with fellow African-American artist, Susie Taylor (born 1885 in NY), who had arrived in Europe sixteen months earlier with the \\"Georgia Pickaninnies\\". The women briefly traveled across the continent together before Susie decided to return home to America. That autumn, as Russia became isolated due to the sudden halt of telegraph and postal services, many other American expatriates began boarding trains and ships in the chaos back towards America, or at least other safer European countries. On June 6, 1907, the 1905 Revolution was finally extinguished with brutal force. Although order was established, the issues that sparked the violence remained and fueled the peasants' desire for revenge. A tense atmosphere gripped the country. There was the constant presence of the strongly emerging left-wing movement which was bent on purging the decadence of Tsarist Russia. This was, of course, the infant Bolshevik movement, but despite this business was booming again. After the revolution, a small suffragette movement swelled across Russia. The emancipation of women brought a shift in Russian society, billowing Victorian gowns were thrown aside and replaced by fashionable unimpeding svelte dresses designed by designer Lamanova. Divorce laws were eased in response to feminine demands for freedom of choice in marriage. Throughout the summer, theaters and cabarets reopened, foreigners returned and entertainers resumed their tours through the major cities. Throughout the year, Black entertainers traveled to Russia in droves. With the exception of random artists touring Europe, very few black people have ever been to Russia, and very few of them have remained in it to live. All across the Russia, Black performers such as Belle Davis, Abbie Mitchell, Josephine Morcashani, the Black Troubadours, and the popular duo Johnson & Dean filled the musichalls with excitement every night. They treated each other cordially and invited each new fellow Negro performer into their hotel rooms for breakfasts consisting of neckbones and beans to feel more at home. In St. Petersburg, a confectioner exploited the popularity of Ragtime by issuing the latest Negro minstrel hits on records pressed into discs of hard baker's chocolate. Days after the Revolution ended, Ollie returned to Russia and resumed touring along Russian theatrical circuits. On June 19, she was at St. Petersburg's Demidov Garden Amusement Park located on 35-39 Ofitserskiy Street (now 35-39 Decembrists Street), performing at the Farce Theatre. Established by businessman Alexander Demidov in 1864, the Amusement Park was a popular family-oriented attraction that offered pantomimes, fireworks, operettas and non-stop cabaret performances. In 1909, Ollie adopted the French influenced pseudonym, La Olliette and paired up with African-American entertainer, Joseph \\"Happy Joe\\" Williams forming the Kreolen Duett (Creole Duet). Together the pair toured across Germany, appearing at Hamburg's Kabarett Holle (November 1‚Äì6). The following year, the pair were appearing in Odessa's famous North Hotel, which had a beautiful open-air caf√© chantant in the back gardens. Odessa was a polyglot city and a cosmopolitan city, and theatrical life there was in full swing. Its population numbered 630 thousand people, a third of whom were Jews and 30 thousand of whom were foreigners - Greeks, Armenians, Germans, Romanians, Italians and many others. With its wide, straight, shady streets and elegant stone houses, it would not be out of place anywhere in the Mediterranean. The city was an important trading center and, despite its distance from two capitals, it was never a quiet or provincial city. Trendy restaurants and hotels, gourmet shops, popular cafes and several theaters enjoyed the attention of many wealthy citizens. Sailors from exotic ports mixed up with the city robbers in noisy taverns next to the commercial port. On the outskirts of the city, the coast of the estuaries was littered with villas, looking at the sparkling sea surface. During their Ukrainian engagement, Ollie spent the majority of her time corresponding with Minnie Brown, who was residing in Moscow. In June 1910, the duo were in Turkey performing in the mysterious Ottoman city of Constantinople before William returned to his residence in London in September. In 1911, Ollie appeared in Riga at the Olympia Theater (February 3‚Äì14) and Reval's Metropol Theater (March 5). =Miss Olita (1912‚Äì1913)= Embarking upon a solo tour, by July 1912 she appearing in Hamburg with variety artist, George Mitchell, as seen on her passport that applied for on July 23 at the American Consulate. Around this time, Ollie was introduced to Danish impresario, Jakob August Jensen. Born on February 14, 1885 in Copenhagen to Augusta Sofie Katrine Marie Johansen and Peter Jensen, Jakob grew up rather comfortably in the middle of the Danish capital near the famous Tivoli Gardens and K√∏benhavns Hovedbaneg√•rd (Copenhagen Central Train Station) at Dannebrogsgade 22 (1890) located in the grimy Meat Packing District and Vesterbrogade 38 (1900) located in the Indre By District. In 1907, Jakob was sentenced to 80 days at Vestre Faengsel Prison for giving gonorrhea to his unsuspecting girlfriend, Anne Marie Anderson Norregaard. A while later, in 1911, Jakob moved to the Netherlands to start a new life in Rotterdam. Not long after meeting, Jakob and Ollie returned to Copenhagen, where they promptly wed. With her new spouse also working as her manager, Ollie, now a solo artist, adopted the new pseudonym, Miss Olita (sometimes spelled Ollita). During the winter, Mr. & Mrs. Jensen returned to the Netherlands, settling in the bustling Dutch city of Amsterdam, where Ollie debuted onstage on November 17, at the Palace Cabaret. =World War I (1914-1918)= On June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, setting in motion the events leading to the outbreak of World War I. In the aftermath of the assassination, the Austro- Hungarian Empire declared war on the Kingdom of Serbia at 11 a.m. on July 28. The Netherlands declared themselves neutral on July 30. According to international law, neutrality had to be declared in each instance of a war declaration between two sovereign nations. During August, the Dutch declaration of neutrality had to be repeated regularly. Foreign artists and musicians returned to their home country and numerous Dutch entertainers were called into arms. Across the Netherlands, the war was followed attentively. Newspapers reported extensively on the progress and consequences of the Great War. The Dutch government urged the press to observe a certain restraint: too much praise or too much criticism for one of the belligerent parties might endanger the fragile Dutch neutrality. However, not everyone observed the requested reserve. Some newspapers and journalists are proponents of one of the factions and others are easily bribed. In 1915, from a military point of view, the neutral Netherlands remained out of reach, but the world conflict had an impact on daily life. The Netherlands was flooded by one million Belgian refugees, that faced boredom and searched for light entertainment. Longing to forget the tensions of time, entertainment life flourished. The cafes, dance halls and cinemas were full of rewards with that extra clientele. Soon, numerous African-American artists who found shelter in the tiny neutral country such as, Elmer Spyglass, Arabella Fields, Josephine Morcashani, Mamie & Holman and Miss Olita were performing around Dutch theatrical circuits. In October 1916, Ollie participated in the two week International Soubrette Contest at the Palace Concert Hall (October 1‚Äì15) alongside popular African- American concert singer, Arabella Fields, whom had fled from Germany with her husband/manager. The following month, she traveled to Amsterdam with a week's engagement at the Grand Gala Theater (November 1‚Äì4). On April 2, 1917, Ollie was in Rotterdam performing at the Metropole Theater. Several weeks later, she traveled to the far southeastern Dutch province of Gelderland that sat along the German border to perform the oldest city in Holland, Nijmegen, where she was thrilled audiences for a week at the Chicago Theater (April 22‚Äì27). In May, she returned to Rotterdam, appearing at the De Matador Cabaret alongside fellow Afro-American entertainers, Arabella Fields and Josephine Morcashani. On July 3, authorities in Amsterdam held back the potato supply until there was enough to feed the whole city. This led to a large riot and looting of stores and markets. Rioters broke into warehouses and took potatoes intended to be exported. Two thousand soldiers were called in to break up the riot but were repelled by the rioters. Another clash took place in the city of Kattenberg where three groups of workmen, one from the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland, protested the lack of food for manual laborers. They also demanded that they receive actual food and not promissory papers. In September, she appeared for two weeks at the American Music-hall (September 16‚Äì30). In late 1918, Ollie appeared at Amsterdam's Grand Gala Theater (Sep.16-30) and Breda's Pergola Theater (Oct.25). =Post War Career (1919-1950)= In 1919, after the war ended, she spent time in Amsterdam, appearing at 'T Brouwhuis (Nov.1-7) and the popular Cabaret de la Monnaie (Dec.6). On March 30, 1920, Ollie renewed her American passport after eight years in order to begin her first European tour since the outbreak of the war. Afterwards, Jakob decided to return home to Denmark, bringing Ollie with him. The couple moved in at 7 Rolsvej with Jakob's older sister, Margrethe Marie Johannes Jensen (born Aug.5, 1878). During the fall of 1920, she was touring Norway, performing at the Maxim Variete (Aug.7-28) and Hjorten (Sep.2-Oct.13) before returning home to Denmark. Danish newspapers make no mention of Ollie performing in the country. She soon retired from the stage and was noted as a housewife in the 1921 Danish Census. In the spring of 1921, Ollie returned the United States after 18 years abroad and reunited with her sister Pearl. Shortly after returning home to Denmark, she divorced her husband and returned to the Netherlands in 1923 to resume her career as a performer. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Ollie returned to being a popular fixture in Holland, Scandinavia and Germany. Moving away from dancing, she performed in cabarets and theaters as a major Afro-American singer. In 1930, after a final visit to the United States, her European engagements began to dwindle and she soon vanished from the limelight after the winter of 1934. By the late-30s, she was residing in The Hague's squalid Jewish Quarter, moving from one apartment to another. Records of Ollie disappear during World War II, possibly in hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands. Life in the Reichskommissariat Niederlande would've been extremely difficult for a 60 year old Afro-American unemployed woman living in the heart of the Jewish district. Ollie Gertrude Fitch died on July 1, 1950 in The Hague at age 69 and was most likely buried in her adopted country.

He served as steward and administrator during the reign of Nasser al Din Shah.  Family  Mehdi Qoli Khan Qajar Qovanlu Amisoleimani was son of Issa Khan-e Etemad od-Dowleh Qovanlu, grandson of Mohammad Qasem Khan-e Zahir od-Dowleh Quovanlou and great grandson of Amir Soleyman Khan-e Etezad od-Dowleh Quovanlu. He was Nasser al-Din Shah's maternal cousin and steward and one of the grandees of the second half of Qajar period who married Touman Aqa Fakhr od-Dowleh, Nasser ed-Din Shah's daughter, in 1883. He died in 1937 and is the ancestor of the Amirsoleymani family. He belonged to the Qovanlu (also spelled Qawanlu) branch of the Qajartribe. The tribe had several other branches, one of the most prominent ones being the Develu, which often fought against the Qovanlu. Hossein Qoli Khan was one of the youngest sons of the chieftain of the Qovanlu clan, Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, and the grandson of Fath Ali Khan, a prominent aristocrat executed by the orders of shah Tahmasp II (possibly at the urging of Nader Qoli Beg, who would become known as Nader Shah after usurping the throne of Iran in 1736, marking the foundation of the Afsharid dynasty). His name now lives on with his grandchildren, which include: Soltan Mahmud Amirsoleimani.

Amirsoleimani came from an important aristocratic and well-known family of high-ranking bureaucrats during the Qajar era, from Tehran. He was Nasser al-Din Shah's steward during a period in which Iran maintained a cautious balance between domestic policy with the religious, administrative, and commercial authorities, and in international relations with European powers. Majd ed-Dowleh Amirsoleimani was one of the supporters for an increase in contact with European powers - such as diplomatic, military personnel, technical and educational experts, merchants, archeologists and curious travelers who spend long periods of time in Iran. Due to the threat of intervention by great powers, such as the Russian Empire, with which they nurtured a fragile peace. He was fluent in English and French and in this regard played a valuable role on the several trips to Europe.

After being backfilled in 1861, it is now Westerstraat. Anjeliersgracht is located between Marnixstraat and Noordermarkt. The canal led from Prinsengracht just south of Noorderkerk to Lijnbaansgracht. Anjeliersstraat runs parallel to the former Anjeliersgracht, today's Westerstraat. History Anjeliersgracht was dug in the 17th century. Houses started to be built along the canal in 1650. Due to the damp, sandy soil, some of the historic buildings suffer from subsidence. A distillery for liqueurs, bitters and elixirs was founded on the Anjeliersgracht in 1684 by Jacob Bols, nephew of Lucas Bols. The company had a house, yard, distillery and store. The neighborhood around the \\"Rinsche Anijsvat\\" distillery held artisanal companies, distilleries, beer brewers and ship's bakeries. The company became the property of Frederik van Zuylekom in 1754, and in the 19th century was merged with Levert & Co. to become Van Zuylekom, Levert & Co. The company was still at Westerstraat 176‚Äì180 after the canal was drained. By 1750 the Noordermarkt near the north of the canal was a popular weekly market. In 1845 it was placed under the municipal administration and stallholders now had to pay rent. In the mid-19th century Jan Schenkman, author of the children's book Sint Nicolaas en zijn knecht (1850), was the head of a school on the Anjeliersgracht, by then one of the dirtiest canals in Amsterdam. People used it to dispose of garbage and human excrement, and the canal smelled strongly. The school had a high ceiling so the children would avoid infection from diseases such as typhus, cholera and malaria, which were thought to spread through bad vapors. The Jordaan was Amsterdam's poorest and most densely populated neighborhood. It began to be cleaned up in the mid-19th century by philanthropic construction companies that demolished shacks and built new houses for workers. Anjeliersgracht was drained in 1861, as were many other Amsterdam canals at the time, and in 1862 it was renamed Westerstraat. The reasons for conversion to a street were the poor water quality and the need to handle increasing road traffic. The new Westerstraat, the pride of the city, was the widest street in Amsterdam.

The game features a fantasy-based open world environment and action based battle system, using elemental magic, character switching and uses gacha game monetization for players to obtain new characters, weapons, and other resources. The game features a limited multiplayer mode allowing up to four players to play together. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Android and iOS on September 28, 2020. The game is also planned for the Nintendo Switch, but no release date has been announced. Genshin Impact takes place on the fictional world of Teyvat, which is home to several nations. Each nation is with an element and worships a god associated with that element. A pair of twins arrive on Teyvat in the distant past, but are barred from leaving by an unknown god. After trapping one, she seals the other for some time. After the sealed twin, who is referred to as the Traveler, awakens, they travel across Teyvat with their newfound companion, Paimon, to look for their twin. The game received generally positive reception, with critics praising the combat and open world freedom, while some criticism was raised at its monetization. The game grossed over in twelve days, recouping its entire budget.  Gameplay  The player may freely explore an open-world map with tools. The green gauge displays the character's health and current level. Genshin Impact is an open world action role-playing game that features the player controlling one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly and during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks at once. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in a variety of ways, such as increasing a character's level, as well as improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips. Other players can join a host's game. In addition to exploration the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are highly powerful enemies and domains which reward highly valuable resources, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank. An increasing Adventure Rank unlocks new challenges, and raises the World Level. The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are, as well as the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives. The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding. These actions are limited by stamina, which is the same for each character. Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as create updrafts or freezing water that can aid the player in traversing terrain. Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that players can warp to, and there are statues that heal and revive characters as well as provide benefits such as increasing player stamina if the proper item is offered. Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources which may used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit and vegetables, or inspecting certain areas. Most foods can be turned into dishes via cooking. Some dishes regenerate characters' health, while others boost various statistics. Mining can be done by attacking and destroying mining nodes to produce ore, though certain characters' attacks will be more effective in procuring ore. Ore can be refined and then used to enhance weapon strength, or create weapons. Each character has two unique combat skills: an elemental skill and an elemental burst. The elemental skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the elemental burst has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy first by defeating enemies or inflicting elemental statuses. Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro and Geo, which correspond to ice, life, fire, water, air, electricity, and earth respectively. These elements can interact in different ways; for example, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the \\"Wet\\" status, and if they are hit with a Cryo attack, it will inflict \\"Cold\\". These two statuses combine into the \\"Frozen\\" status, which temporarily prevents the target from performing any actions or until the player deals enough physical damage to the enemy. Switching between characters during combat and executing those skills allows those elemental interactions to take place. Certain elemental abilities may be required to solve puzzles within the overworld, such as lighting torches. A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co- op. Up to 4 players can play together in the overworld, and join Domains. Player matching can either be done by requesting to join with another player, or if the player wishes to do a Domain with other players, they will be automatically matched up with others who are looking to tackle the same objective. The game features cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other. By completing quests to advance the story, the player is able to unlock three additional playable characters, and additional characters can be obtained via a gacha mechanic. Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases and playing the game, can be used to obtain characters and weapons.  Story  = Setting = Genshin Impact takes place on the island of Teyvat, which is divided into several nations and regions: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, Snezhnaya, and Khaenri'ah. Currently players can only visit Mondstadt and Liyue. Mondstadt, known as the city of freedom, worships Barbatos, the Anemo Archon and sits on an island in the middle of a lake. Mondstadt's region occupies the northeastern half of the map, and in the southeastern half of the map lies the nation of Liyue, which worships the Geo Archon Rex Lapis and is the largest market harbor in Teyvat. Each nation takes inspiration from a real world region, incorporating regional aesthetics. Mondstadt uses central European influences while Liyue uses many common Chinese elements, such as the Stone Forest. Each nation is associated with and worships an Archon, of which there are seven. Each Archon is tied to one of the game's elements, which is reflected in their nation's element as well. An Archon's strength is tied to how firmly they control their nation. Certain individuals chosen by the Archons are given a Vision ‚Äî magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to control an element. In gameplay, each playable character (except the Traveler) is a Vision wielder. = Plot = The game starts as two twins traveling across the stars arrive in Teyvat and find that it is ablaze with the fires of war. However, as they attempt to leave, they encounter and fight a mysterious god. The god captures one of the twins and seals away the other one, depending on the choice of the player. Some undisclosed amount of time later, the sealed twin awakens, and meets Paimon while fishing. On their way, they encounter a dragon named Stormterror, who later attacks the town of Mondstadt. After saving the town, the twin meets Jean, the leader of the Knights of Favonius, joins the Knights and is sent to numerous temples to restore stability to the region. It is discovered that the dragon's true name is Dvalin, and that he was once a guardian of Mondstadt. The Traveler encounters a bard named Venti, who is actually Barbatos, the archon presiding over Mondstadt. Venti develops a plan to quell Dvalin's rage, for which they need to steal a holy lyre, that by playing it to Dvalin would calm his rage. However, they are beaten to it by a member of the Fatui, a group of secret diplomatic agents from the nation of Snezhnaya and are framed for the robbery. The Traveler and Venti take refuge with bar owner Diluc, where they are reunited with Jean, who is working unofficially with the group to avoid destroying diplomatic relations with Snezhnaya. The group retrieves the lyre from a nearby Fatui hideout and repairs it. Venti plays the lyre to summon Dvalin, but it is revealed he is under the influences of the Abyss Mages, sorcerers who are a part of the Abyss Order that despise humanity. The group pursues Dvalin to his hideout, and frees him from the Abyss Mages' influence. After returning the lyre, the Traveler and Venti are ambushed by the Fatui, and Venti's Gnosis, a conduit that allows Venti to use magic, is stolen. The Traveler resolves to meet all seven of the archons, and Venti advises the Traveler to travel to Liyue to meet Rex Lapis, the god presiding over the city, as he may have information on the other twins' whereabouts. However, Rex Lapis is assassinated, and the twin petitions the adepti, spiritual guardians of Liyue, for help. Once they return to Liyue, they contact several officials to meet the body of Rex Lapis, which has been hidden away for unknown reasons. Helping prepare the ritual for the fallen archon, they receive an invitation to meet the Liyue Qixing, the people in charge of the commerce within Liyue.  Development  Genshin Impact was developed by the Shanghai-based studio miHoYo, who announced in June 2019. The game had a development and marketing budget of around . It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Android, and iOS on September 28, 2020, and features cross-platform play between them. The game's developers sought to create a game that was distinct from Honkai Impact 3rd in terms of its quest and combat systems as well as its random events and mode of exploration. Musicians and staff of HOYO-MiX, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra created the music for Genshin Impact. =Localization= Genshin Impact is available in several languages, with voiceovers in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and English. Genshin Impact takes a different title in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, being simply shortened to the first word of the international title (i.e., Yu√°nsh√©n ÂéüÁ•û in Chinese, Genshin ÂéüÁ•û in Japanese and Wonsin ÏõêÏã† in Korean). The different pronunciations simply reflect the local way of pronouncing the original Chinese title, which means \\"primordial gods\\".  Reception  Genshin Impact received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic. The open world of Teyvat drew praise; IGN Travis Northup described Teyvat as \\"a world that is absolutely bursting at the seams with possibilities.\\" Game Informer describes the game as an incredible experience, noting that \\"the gameplay loop of collection, upgrading, and customization is captivating and compelling\\", Destructoid Chris Carter called the combat system \\"one of the most interesting things about Genshin Impact. The game's similarities to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sparked controversy at 2019's ChinaJoy convention among some fans of Breath of the Wild. In contrast, The Washington Post wrote that the game wore its inspiration from Breath of the Wild \\"proudly\\". Most of the criticisms about Genshin Impact come from the endgame aspects of the game, particularly the resin system. Paul Tassi of Forbes noted that to progress past a certain point one must \\"spend an absurd amount of money to get around the last few timegates of the game.\\" PC Gamer said that playing the endgame becomes \\"a slog\\", and that the resin system \\"feels so unnecessary\\". =Revenue= Prior to its release the game saw 21.3 million registrations, 16 million of which being China. According to some, Genshin Impact was the biggest international release of any Chinese video game. During the week of its release, Genshin Impact saw over 17 million downloads and grossed approximately . Within two weeks, it was estimated that the game had grossed over , recouping its budget. Its largest revenue came from China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. =Controversy and censorship= When the game was released to the public, players discovered that the game's kernel-based anti-cheat system would remain active after the game was closed or uninstalled, which raised concerns that the game had installed spyware. Some Japanese players using iOS devices also observed that the game read the contents of players' clipboards while starting up. The official announced both issues have been addressed and fixed. On October 6, 2020, journalist and Twitch streamer Kazuma Hashimoto published a video on social media site Twitter demonstrating how Chinese political terms such as \\"Hong Kong\\" and \\"Taiwan\\" are censored within the in-game chat. As the developer of the game, miHoYo, is based in China, they are subject to China's censorship policy, which includes complying with a list of banned words that cannot be used in game or via chat. Other terms not related to Chinese politics are banned as well, such as \\"Putin\\", \\"Hitler\\", and \\"Stalin\\". Several threads on the game's subreddit discussed the censorship, with various users noting that innocuous terms such as \\"enemies\\" and \\"words\\" were also being censored.

A prominent member of the Chinese New Left, he is dean of the Liberal Arts College at Sun Yat-sen University, and was formerly professor of political philosophy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Career Born in 1952 in Shenyang, Gan was raised in Hangzhou, Fujian. Gan was a Red Guard in the early years of the Cultural Revolution, but became disillusioned with the movement and was sent to labour in the Greater Khingan Mountains in 1970. He was admitted to Heilongjiang University after the death of Mao Zedong, graduating in 1982. Gan then pursued graduate studies in philosophy at Peking University, where he was a classmate of Liu Xiaofeng. At Beijing he developed an interest in continental philosophy, particularly the thought of Martin Heidegger and the Neo-Kantians. He graduated with a master's degree in 1985 and played an important role in disseminating Western philosophy in China in the late 1980s. In 1989, Gan enrolled as a PhD student under the Committee of Social Thought at the University of Chicago, but left Chicago ten years later without a doctorate. He was appointed professor of political philosophy at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, then moved to Sun Yat-sen University as dean of the Liberal Arts College in 2009, where he presided over a general reform of liberal arts at the university on Straussian lines, emphasising Chinese, Latin, and Ancient Greek classics. Gan was described in 2013 as \\"one of the most prominent political philosophers of contemporary China\\". Views =Early liberalism and turn to cultural conservatism= Gan started his academic career as a liberal and a disciple of Western Enlightenment philosophy, but, influenced by Ernst Cassirer, he began to alter his views in 1987, cautioning that there were Western philosophers who had exposed the limits of reason as a philosophical principle. Gan then adopted a more culturally conservative position, arguing that a return to Confucianism was necessary to counterbalance the negative aspects of modernisation in China. For Gan at this stage of his thinking, freedom at the individual level was a higher concern than democracy and science, the two catchwords of the May Fourth Movement: Chinese intellectuals had so far \\"never dared to regard 'the freedom of individuals' as the first principle\\". He initially supported the Chinese democracy movement and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After moving to Chicago in 1989, Gan became increasingly influenced as a student of Allan Bloom by American conservative philosophy and the thought of Leo Strauss. In a preface to a Chinese translation of Strauss's Natural Right and History in 2003, Gan drew on Strauss's thought to argue that the predominant danger of persecution in philosophy was not the persecution of the philosopher by an unphilosophical wider society, but the persecution of the multitude by the philosopher. Modern philosophy has \\"gone mad\\", Gan states, and is promoting the continual remaking of politics according to competing philosophical abstractions; in light of the \\"politicization of philosophy\\" and the \\"philosophization of politics\\", philosophy has become a disease which must be controlled. =Chinese New Left and socialist Confucianism= In the 1990s, Gan joined the emerging Chinese New Left, and after 2000 announced his support for the establishment of a \\"socialist Confucian republic\\". According to Gan, the ideal of a Confucian socialist republic is already embodied in the official name of the People's Republic of China: the title of \\"People's Republic\\" demarcates the country as a socialist republic constituted by workers and peasants and not a capitalist state, while the name \\"China\\" itself invokes the Confucian tradition of Chinese civilisation. Commenting upon China's reform process, Gan has criticised linear models of economic development and suggested that the model of Township and Village Enterprises in the Chinese countryside offers an alternative vision of modernity to the Western capitalist world order. While other scholars such as Qin Hui dismissed the importance of the TVEs, Gan suggested that by avoiding the pronounced urban‚Äìrural divide characteristic of Western industrialisation, cooperative forms of industry like the TVEs could effect a more dispersed form of development that would preserve traditional rural industries in China. Gan has been influenced both by Western postmodernists, such as Michel Foucault, and by Western Marxism, including the thought of Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse.

Born as the illegitimate daughter to the musician Nora Brownsford and the artist Augustus John, she enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art and later the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. Johnstone's work was exhibited in art galleries across the United Kingdom and abroad from the 1960s to the late 2000s. Biography Gwyneth Johnstone was born on 18 June 1915 in the Norfolk village of Coltishall; she always concealed her actual birth date. Johnstone was the illegitimate daughter of the musician Nora Brownsford and the artist Augustus John. Her mother gave her daughter the allusive surname of Johnstone from a tutor at Alderney and raised her with a distance relationship with her father in Norwich and London. Johnstone was resented by her half-sisters and was ridiculed by society for being an illegitimate child. She was educated at the Saint Felix School in Southwold, where she saw the paintings of Christopher Wood and other modernists of the era, which were purchased by Lucy Mary Silcox, the school's headteacher. From March 1933 to June 1938, Johnstone enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, where she struggled early on. There, established life long friendships with fellow artists Mary Fedden and Virginia Parsons. Her final year at the art school saw her study stage and decorative painting. Afterwards Johnstone was taught academicised cubism by the painter Andr√© Lhote at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, and for a brief period in the early 1950s, she took life classes with the surrealist artist Cecil Collins at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Johnstone's work appeared in several groups, including Young Contemporaries, The London Group and the Women's International Art Club, the latter of which she became a vice-president of. Her first solo show was at the Woodstock Gallery in 1960, which she followed with a series of exhibitions at the Portal Gallery, and she went on to showcase her work abroad. According to Tanya Herrod of The Guardian, \\"her art must have appeared wildly out of step with contemporary practice\\", but her work had a revival with multiple solo exhibitions from the 1980s on, including the New Grafton Art Gallery in 1983, Sally Hunter & Patrick Seale Fine Art two years later, the Michael Parkin Fine Art in 1993 and the School House Gallery at Wighton near Wells-next-the-Sea in 2007. Johnstone died in Colitishall on 8 December 2010. Personality and personal life A personal friend of Johnstone's described her as \\"a really lovely lady\\" who believed \\"she led a bit of a Bohemian lifestyle.\\" She owned homes in the South of France and later the hills of Benidorm. Johnstone was unmarried though she courted the pianist Francis Davies from the 1940s until his death in 2008. Analysis Johnson was influenced by the Virgilian woodcuts of William Blake, the intense landscapes of Shoreman's primitives and chapbooks. She used oil in her paintings, and focused on themes containing \\"shepherds, fishermen and lovers at ease in wild Mediterranean landscapes\\", and called her work, \\"romantic modern landscapes\\". In the 1977 book Twentieth Century British Na√Øve and Primitive Artists, Eric Lister and Sheldon Williams wrote of Johnstone's paintings: \\"Despite the individuality of her work, there is more than a smattering of impressionism in some of the effects she invokes\\", which give the paintings \\"a paradoxical sophistication.\\" The two noted the individuals, landscapes, the woods and cottages seen in Johnstone's work had \\"a strong lyrical character\\".

The core concept is the encapsulation of concurrent threads of execution (here encompassing kernel and userland threads and processes) by way of control flow constructs that have clear entry and exit points and that ensure all spawned threads have completed before exit. The concept is analogous to structured programming, which introduced control flow constructs that encapsulated sequential statements and subroutines. Such encapsulation allows errors in concurrent threads to be propagated to the control structure's parent scope and managed by the native error handling mechanisms of each particular computer language. It allows control flow to remain readily evident by the structure of the source code despite the presence of concurrency. To be effective, this model must be applied consistently throughout all levels of the program-- otherwise concurrent threads may leak out, become orphaned, or fail to have runtime errors correctly propagated. The concept was formulated in 2016 by Martin S√∫strik (creator of ZeroMQ), and then further refined in 2018 by Nathaniel J. Smith, who implemented it in Trio. Meanwhile, Roman Elizarov independently came upon the same ideas while developing an experimental coroutine library for the Kotlin language. In 2019, the loom project from OpenJDK is adopting structured concurrency to bring it to the Java platform in a future release as part of a larger work on lightweight threads and coroutines  Variations  A major point of variation is how an error in one member of a concurrent thread tree is handled. Simple implementations will merely wait until the children and siblings of the failing thread run to completion before propagating the error to the parent scope. However, that could take an indefinite amount of time. The alternative is to employ a general cancellation mechanism (typically a cooperative scheme allowing program invariants to be honored) to terminate the children and sibling threads in an expedient manner.

History Feminist anthropology is an integrative approach to anthropology, combining the fields of biology, culture, linguistics and archaeology. The discipline originated in the 1970s and developed from two earlier phases: the anthropology of women and the anthropology of gender. Feminist anthropology was formally recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology in the late 1970s. The history of the Association for Feminist Anthropology began in 1988, when a group of American anthropologists met in Phoenix, Arizona with the goal of establishing, \\"in the beginning, an 'anthropology of women' and later, a feminist and gendered anthropology to the discipline\\". The organization's founding leaders are: Naomi Quinn, Carole Hill, Sylvia Forman, Rayna Rapp and Louise Lamphere. The group recognized the need for anthropologists who studied subjects of gender and gender equality, to have their own professional space within anthropology. The Association for Feminist Anthropology (AFA) was formally established by unanimous vote in the 1988 meeting, and formally approved as a section of the American Anthropological Association, soon afterward. The beginning years of the AFA saw the establishment of several areas of interest that continue today. Currently, the major themes that are the focus of working commissions within the organization are: Gender and the Curriculum, Women and Human Rights, and the Commission on Women‚Äôs Reproductive Rights and Bodily Autonomy. Awards and scholarship =Michelle Rosaldo Book Prize= AFA's Michelle Rosaldo Book Prize is named after anthropologist, Michelle Rosaldo, the co- editor of Woman, Culture and Society, the 1974 publication that was instrumental in launching the field of feminist anthropology. The first book award is given to an anthropologist who makes an exceptional contribution to the field of feminist anthropology. =Sylvia Forman Prize= The Sylvia Forman Prize is named for the late Sylvia Helen Forman, a founding leader of the AFA, and a dedicated scholar and teacher, whose work was a major contribution to feminist anthropology. The annual award will be given to one graduate and one undergraduate student. Publications =AFA annual journals= The official journal Voices was published annually until Spring, 2019. The current journal, Feminist Anthropology will began its first term, beginning in July, 2019. =Books= The AFA has published three edited volumes: From Labrador to Samoa: Theory and Practice of Eleanor Burke Leacock, Gender and Race through Education and Political Activism: The Legacy of Sylvia Helen Forman, and Feminism, Nationalism and Militarism.

As a postdoc, he led the first positional cloning of a gene required for regeneration of amputated fins, and he established zebrafish as a model for innate heart regeneration. With the latter discovery, it became clear that heart regeneration occurs and is efficient in some vertebrates, and that it could be dissected using molecular genetics in a tractable model system. Since then, he and his postdocs, students, and staff have innovated many tools to interrogate tissue regeneration. Poss reported that heart muscle cells, not stem cells, are activated by injury to divide and directly replace lost cardiac tissue. His lab has a history of research findings on the outer layer of the heart called the epicardium, beginning with discovery of its dynamism upon injury, to its fate-mapping, to its roles in releasing pro-regenerative factors, and to studies describing its own regenerative capacity. His group applied Brainbow- based technology to demonstrate that particularly high proliferative activity by a small number of muscle cells, known as clonal dominance, creates the structure of the adult heart. His lab also identified a key factor important for the process by which zebrafish regenerate spinal cord tissue to reverse a paralyzing injury. Recently, he introduced the concept of tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs), sequences that regulate regeneration programs and can be engineered to enhance tissue regeneration. = Awards = Poss was a Helen Hay Whitney Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow, a Pew Scholar, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Early Career Scientist.

The film starring Kaushik Ganguly, Rudranil Ghosh was released on 1 November 2019. This is the debut film of Indraadip Dasgupta as a film director. The music of the film was composed by Arijit Singh and Anirban Sengupta. Plot The narrative is an exploration of ennui, stagnancy and transformation. It is a slice of life, caught between two eternities of darkness. Through the course of the story, the protagonist ventures into an uncharted landscape of desires and choices. The film is a eulogic tribute to a dying art form, ventriloquism. The story has been woven from bildungsroman, and old Calcutta memories. The film narrates the story of a feeble man who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy. Narasingha is a ventriloquist. When the relevance of his art started to fade away, so did his livelihood. Resigned to life under the shadow of his memories, he breaks bread with a junk-dealer, Keshto. Through the course of the film Narasingha ‚Äòs loneliness becomes a painted picture, replete with images and voices borrowed from the past. The story takes a turn when Keshto presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns.

Early life and education Edith Willis was born in New York City, February 19, 1865. She was a daughter of Dr. Frederic L. H. Willis, who was a member of the family of N. P. Willis, and who formerly practiced medicine in New York. Her mother was Love M. Willis, who was well known some years ago as a writer of juvenile stories. Both parents were inclined to literature, and the daughter inherited the literary inclination. When Forbes was six years old, the family went to Glenora, New York on Seneca Lake, for the summers, and to Boston, Massachusetts, for the winters. In Boston, she was educated in private schools until she was eighteen years old, after which her education was conducted by private tutors. Career Since the age of eleven, she preserved all her compositions, and by 1893, the number was nearly 400. She wrote very little in prose, a few short stories descriptive of nature. Forbes was proficient in French, German and English literature and music. She contributed to The Christian Register, the Cottage Hearth, the Christian Union, the Boston Transcript, Godey's Lady's Book, Peterson's Magazine, the Kew Moon, the Century, and other prominent periodicals. She published a volume of Poems (Buffalo, New York, 1891). In 1920, she established the Rochester Poetry Society, and served as president. She also affiliated with the Women's Education and Industrial Union, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Door of Hope. Personal life In 1886, she married Dr. Samuel H. Linn who served at the court of Czar Nicholas II of Russia as the official dentist. They had two sons. She traveled in Europe and through the United States after this marriage. Her second husband, George Mather Forbes was a faculty member of the University of Rochester. Forbes made her home in Rochester, New York. She died in Starkey, New York, October 1, 1945.

He had set off from Aalborg in Denmark at 1503, flying to Norway to refuel at 1603. It took off at 1650 to take part in a mission over the Skagerrak, between Norway and Denmark. At 1710, a false message was sent to the German nightfighter headquarters in Denmark, saying that the aircraft's starboard engine was on fire; the aircraft dropped down to sea level and dropped three life rafts. =Interception= Two Spitfires from 165 Squadron were sent to intercept the Ju-88, making contact with the Ju-88 at 1805, west of Aberdeen; the Ju-88 dropped its flaps and undercarriage and launched red flares. The Ju-88 landed at Aberdeen at 1820. One of the German aircrew was not compliant following the landing and had to be taken at gunpoint. Schmid was detained as a prisoner of war, after being detained in the Officer's Mess for a week with the other crew of his aircraft. =Aircraft testing= Once the aircraft was captured, German nightfighters could be detected much earlier.

The story was inspired by a French tale of unknown origin, and several variations of the story have since appeared in print. Background In the introduction to Tales of a Traveller, Irving, under the guise of his fictional alter-ego Geoffrey Crayon, writes that \\"The following adventures were related to me by the same nervous gentleman\\" who he claims told him the story of \\"The Stout Gentleman\\", which was published in Irving's 1822 episodic novel Bracebridge Hall. In regards to \\"The Adventure of the German student\\", Irving writes that \\"the story, or rather than the latter part of it, is founded on an anecdote related to me as existing somewhere in the French\\". Irving would go on to reveal in journals that the story had been told to him by Thomas Moore. Plot The story is set during the French Revolution, and follows a young German man named Gottfried Wolfgang. On his way home to his apartment in Paris, France, on a stormy night, Wolfgang encounters a woman who claims to be without friends, family, or a home. She is described as wearing \\"a broad, black band round her neck, clasped by diamonds\\". Wolfgang takes her back to his lodgings, where they declare their devotion for one another. The next morning, after temporarily leaving the woman alone, Wolfgang returns to find her as a corpse in his bed. The police are summoned, and one of the officers recognizes the woman as having been executed by guillotine the previous day. The officer undoes the collar around the neck of the corpse, causing the head to roll onto the floor. At the end of the story, the incident is revealed to have been recounted by \\"the old gentleman with the haunted head\\", and is said to have been relayed by Wolfgang, who now resides in a madhouse in Paris. Other versions Alexandre Dumas implemented a similar plot for his 1851 story \\"La femme au collier de velours\\", or \\"The woman with the velvet necklace\\". Some later collections of Irving's work use Dumas's title for Irving's version of the story. It is unknown whether Dumas was inspired by Irving's story, or whether they both drew inspiration from a common source. A variation of the story appears under the title \\"The Velvet Ribbon\\" in the 1970 children's book Ghostly Fun by Ann McGovern. In this version, an unnamed woman, who always wears a black velvet ribbon around her neck, marries a man who becomes increasingly frustrated at her refusal to remove the ribbon. One night, the husband retrieves a pair of scissors from the wife's sewing basket. He cuts the ribbon with the scissors, causing her head to roll onto the floor. This version of the story was re-printed in the book The Haunted House and Other Spooky Poems and Tales that same year. Yet another variation of the story, titled \\"The Green Ribbon\\", appears in the 1984 book In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories by Alvin Schwartz. In this version, a girl named Jenny, who wears a green ribbon around her neck, meets a boy named Alfred. Jenny refuses to tell Alfred why she wears the ribbon, even when wearing the ribbon as the two are married. After reaching old age, Jenny allows Alfred to untie the ribbon, causing her head to fall onto the floor.

Nicolas established KWEX-TV in San Antonio, which became the cornerstone of the network that would later become Univision. Life and career Born in Frontera, Coahuila, Mexico in 1930, Nicolas initially came to the United States to learn English and attended St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas. He graduated in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in biology and chemistry with a minor in math. He went on to earn a master's degree at Trinity University in San Antonio in 1952 before going to work for the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research as a researcher on arteriosclerosis and the polio vaccine. In 1955, Nicolas joined KCOR, America's first full-time Spanish-language station, as a producer and director of news. By day, he oversaw the news department, and by night, he produced live programming. At the time, about 50% of the programs on KCOR were live and entertainment shows that featured a host of the best available talent from Mexico. Many of these shows were broadcast from the studios of the KXTN radio station which aired the programs simultaneously. The station was popular among the Mexican and Spanish-speaking residents of San Antonio, however advertisers did not acknowledge the market and failed to use it for promotions. At the time, Hispanic viewers were not accounted for in the standard ratings services. Many viewers were cautious about acknowledging their heritage or disclosing their exposure to Spanish language media for fear of discrimination. In 1961, after spending heavily on live talent and receiving limited financial support from the advertising agencies, Raoul A. Cortez sold KCOR-TV to Nicolas and a group of investors. Nicolas renamed the station KWEX, which would become the hub of operations for the Spanish International Network, the predecessor to Univision. The call letters for KCOR-AM were kept for the radio station and it continued to broadcast Spanish- language programming. Nicolas set up KWEX to operate by distributing content across the country via satellite, a technique that would later be replicated by CNN and Fox News. SIN grew and began airing the national Spanish-language television newscast in 1981. The network was first sold to Hallmark Cards in the 1980s and later became Univision. In 2006, the National Association of Broadcasters jointly honored Nicolas and Cortez for their pioneering work bringing Hispanic programming to America. In the 1960s, Nicolas successfully lobbied the U.S. Congress to mandate that all television sets be equipped to receive both VHF and UHF signals. In 1975, Nicolas launched the Teleton Navideno, a televised drive to raise money for the less fortunate in San Antonio during the holidays. He was Chairman of the National Association of Spanish Broadcasters and served on the boards of the University of the Incarnate Word, Southwest Foundation, the Moody College of Communication, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce. In 2019, the headquarters of Texas Public Radio was renamed in honor of Nicolas and his wife, Irma. On 12 October 2019, he died in San Antonio at the age of 88.

Map of Samara, 1886  Early History  In Western European Sources information of Central Asia in the third quarter of the 12th Century is unknown. Information of Central Asia appears in Europe in connection with the legendary figure of Prester John, which dates from 1165. One of the earliest document where the toponym is mentioned is the Chronicle by Hugh of Saint Victor, one of the founders of the 12th century Saint Victorian school of theology. He established the chronicle named the Description of World Map, in which the most important cities and settlements were shown. In the Book of Extractions by Richard of Saint Victor, which dates from 1153‚Äì1162, it mentioned Samara. Samara among other Scythian cities is located beyond the Caucasian mountains in the northeast. On the Christianization of the ruling elite of the Khazar Kaganate in the 8th century, archeological investigations in the region of the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù Belendzher in the Caucasus testify . Later, under the onslaught of the Arab troops, the Khazars will move to the north, there will be a massive subsidence on the ground, resulting in a so-called Saltov-Mayak culture, which currently rests at the bottom of the Sulak Hydroelectric Power Plant . Note that such ‚Äúmini-Atlantis‚Äù on the site of the Khazar urban centers were formed on the territory of the USSR due to the creation of reservoir systems . The funerary complex around Chir-Yurt belongs to three ethnic groups that inhabited the city: Alans ( catacomb burials ), Bulgarians( pit burials ), Khazars (kurkan catacombs). In the kurgan section of the cemetery where the Khazars rested, scientists discovered two small churches of the 8th century, which is a clear indication of the Christianization of the ruling elite of the Kaganate before its Judaization at the turn of the 8th ‚Äî 9th centuries. On the Middle Volga in the steppe valleys of the Samara Luka in the beginning of the 21st century, several burial grounds with sub-burial burials of the turn of the 7th ‚Äî 8th centuries were investigated, which are similar to the kurgan burials of the Lower Volga and the Don. For example, in one rich burial were found overlays from onions of ‚ÄúKhazar type‚Äù. The presence of the Khazars is marked far to the north of the Samara Luka. In the cemetery with a Shilovka (about 100 km to the north along the Volga), in a rich burial, in addition to the golden Byzantine solidarity of the 7th century, there were also bone plates with hunting scenes, images of soldiers on the fortress wall, etc. Experts believe that the patterns on the bone plates are close to the images on silver dishes, which were made in one of the Khazar jewelry workshops. In addition to the legend relating to the ‚ÄúKasr‚Äù (from the Arabic. ‚ÄúCastle‚Äù) Samara, the artists edged the miniature of the city with rivers. At the source of the river Samara (Samur ), which flows into the Volga, the artist placed the image of the only tree on the whole map. From the bottom of the tree flows eastward stream. Near the \\"miracle tree\\" comment: \\"Here is a tree from which water flows\\" (perhaps, we are talking about the tree Betula alba (pendula) - birch and birch sap). The source of this legend we find in the report of Ibn Fadlan, who is part of the embassy of the Abbasid Caliph al-Muqtadir(908‚Äì932) visited Volga Bulgaria in May 922. It can be assumed that this information came to the West from the Arab-Persian world or through Byzantium, or through Sicily, during the reign of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194-1250). If we talk about the archaeological evidence of the times of the Golden Horde, then in the Samara area there are two settlement sites that relate to this era: one is 20 km below the settlement of Singiley ; another in front of Samara near the village Perevolok . As early as the 19th century, ruins of brick and stone buildings visible above the ground were observed in the area of fortifications, silver and copper coins were encountered, but systematic archaeological research was not conducted there [9] . On the 1448 plan-plan of the Benedictine monk from the monastery of St. Peter [en] in Salzburg ( lat. Ordinis Sancti Benedicti de Salisburg ) Andreas Walchperger [en] (born around 1415) on a large river in Eastern Europe is present the toponym ‚ÄúSamarchar‚Äù . Fortified castle, located on the left bank of Edil (Volga) on the 1459 world map, Fra Mauro is called Samar ( Latin Samar ). Samar (a), surrounded by high fortress towers with battlements, between which there are passage gates, is located at the confluence of the ‚Äúblue river‚Äù ( Italian fl [umen] coche su ) into the Volga. The name suggests that the waters of the river Samara in the Middle Ages were distinguished by purity and transparency. On this wonderful map of the world, based on the best graphic and written sources available to its creators, you can immediately place accents about the unlawful identification of Samara and Samarkand in foreign historiography for a long time - a legend placed near the city of Samarkand reads: ‚ÄúThe Samarkand Kingdom . This Kingdom of Samarkand was ruled by Tamerlane ... This glorious city [Samarkand] was decorated with beautiful nobility by the most beautiful buildings, among which the castle was particularly notable for its size and power. The governor of this state was exclusively of that kind from which Tamerlan himself descended ‚Äù. Al-Masudi's narrative about the adoption of Judaism in the Khazars during the reign of Kharuna al-Rush≈´da was based on an even earlier essay, now lost. There are two fragments, which are based on the protograph that has not come down to us. They were incorporated into the composition of the Arab cosmographer Shams ad-dun Muhammad ibn ab·ªπ Tqlib ad- Dimashk (1256-1327). It says that at the time of Huruna ar-Rash≈´da the emperor of the Romans (apparently, it was Nikifor I (ruled in 802‚Äì811, since 803, together with his son Stavraki ), expelled the Jews from Byzantium. They moved to Khazaria,‚ÄúWhere they found intelligent and pious people, declared their faith to them, and they recognized it as the most correct, joined it, remaining [in this faith] for a while. Then the army fought with them from Khorasan, captured their cities, their country, they [the Khazars] became [their] subjects. Says Ibn al-Athir [an Arab historian who lived in 1160 - 1234 - approx. auth.] also that they converted to Islam in 254 [ on Hijra, i.e. in 868 - approx. auth.]; He points out that the cause of their acceptance of Islam was the military attack of the Turks. So they [the Khazars] asked for help from the people of Khorezm, and they answered: ‚ÄúYou are the infidels, accept Islam, and we will help you.‚Äù They accepted Islam, except for their king, and the Khorezmians helped them, and the Turks withdrew from them. After that, they accepted Islam and their king. We also cite information from the essay \\"News of Khozars, Burtas, Bulgarians ...\\" by an Arab geographer of the early 10th century. Abu 'Al≈´ Ahmed Ibn' Omar, Ibn Ruste (Ibn Dusta), when the top of the Khazar state already accepted Judaism, i.e. roughly from 802/803 to 869/870 :‚ÄúThey call their king Isha [Beck - approx. auth.]; their sovereign, Khozar-Hakan. But this last only by the name of the sovereign, the real power belongs to Isha, since he is in a position of this kind with respect to the affairs of command and control of the troops, which gives no account to anyone who would stand above him. The supreme head of them professes the Hebrew faith; of the same faith as Isha, so are the captains and nobles who are with him; the rest of the Khozars profess a religion similar to that of the Turks ‚Äù .  16th century  The foundation of the Samara small town in the Samara natural boundary occurred in 1586 by decree of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich on the bank of the Samara River near its confluence with the Volga under the direction of Prince G. O. Zasekinand the Streletsky heads of the ‚Äúcomrade‚Äù (deputy governor) Yelchaninov and Streshnev. The purpose of the fortress is the protection of shipping on the Middle Volga and the protection of state frontiers from raids by the steppe The fortress was built on the territory now occupied by the Samara valve factory, and to the south of it - that is, in the direction of the r. Samara. It was built from May 22 to August 19. Art. (May 9 - August 6, Art. Art.) 1586. The first inhabitants were the serving people: the boyars' children, archers, gunners and collars, who carried the guard service, guarding the new fortress ‚Äúfrom thieves‚Äù and from the Nogai attacks . The fortress has not survived to this day (it burned down in the fires of 1690 and 1703), however, it was possible to restore its exact dimensions (perimeter 635 m) and location. The Samara fortress of 1586 was a fortification of two parallel log walls, which every 6‚Äì8 m were joined by transversal walls cut at them at a right angle. The space between the walls (its width could be different, reaching 3 m) was filled with earth and stones. The total thickness of such a fortress wall was about 5 m. The height of the Samara city wall is not known from the documents, but, following the height of the wall in the Volga cities, we can assume that it varied in different areas from 4.5 to 6 m. Samara Fortress had 8 towers, of which 4 were passable, that is, had a gate. The fortress towers are structures with hipped roofs, in terms of square, quadrangular or (at the corners) polygonal, with sides from 4 to 14 m long, usually 8‚Äì10 m high, with single towers about 6 m high or vice versa up to 15 m. The tower protruded 2‚Äì3 m outside the walls of the fortress. Inside the tower, three tiers ('battles') were equipped inside, each of which housed guns. Some towers did not have a hip roof, but all had clouds (or breaks) - an extended and overhanging upper part, due to which a vertical slot formed between the upper and lower layers of the walls for firing from above to the besiegers. The distance between adjacent towers varied, sometimes differing by half. Service on the tower was carried by a guard from one representative of the \\"boyars' children\\" appointed by the voivode and armed archers sent by the archer's head (for example, Kazan, usually 4 archers for each tower) usually 8‚Äì10 m high with single towers about 6 m high or vice versa up to 15 m. The tower protruded 2‚Äì3 m outside the walls of the fortress. Inside the tower, three tiers ('battles') were equipped inside, each of which housed guns.

Service on the tower was carried by a guard from one representative of the \\"boyars' children\\" appointed by the voivode and armed archers sent by the archer's head (for example, Kazan, usually 4 archers for each tower) . Probably already in 1587 (in any case, not later than the beginning of the 1590s), the Samara fortress (or the city , or the Kremlin ) was surrounded on 3 sides by a second defensive line - a wall of guard type (1542 m long). Ostrog (more rarely, palisade ) is, in fact, a high fence of vertically standing log-piles with a diameter of 25‚Äì30 cm vertically standing close to each other. The height of the wall was 4-4.5 m (according to Laishev, Malmyzh and other fortresses of the Volga region). Samara fortress had 8 towers (probably four-walled [24]), and some of them were also passing. The combination of fortress and fort is typical of Russian defense town planning of the 16th ‚Äî 17th centuries. They are interrelated parts of a single defensive complex, the general plan for the construction of which, apparently, already existed in 1586. The topography of the Samara fortress in 1586, the fort, the first cathedral churches of Samara and the church of the first Samara monastery are presented for reconstruction. The first image of Samara is widely known in the description and in the engraving by A. Olearius. The Holstein embassy of 1636 sailed past Samara \\"even before the rising of the Sun\\" and made only a brief stop, after which \\"they dismissed the sails and set off further.\\" The channel of the Volga at that period was 2 versts from Samara (= 2.1 km). That is, the city of A. Olearius observed from afar and under unfavorable light conditions - in the predawn twilight or in the blinding rays of the rising sun in the east. Therefore, it is not necessary to rely on the accuracy of the transfer of A. Olearius to the location of churches and other details. But even in such conditions, the engraving correctly shows the number of towers and churches (except for the southern part of the fortress, which is the farthest from the observer, the worst part of the fortress), a cautious type of wall on the Volga coast is realistically reflected. During the XVII century the city grew and continued to strengthen. By the beginning of 1700, the fortification of Samara included five lines of wooden fortifications: a fortress (the Kremlin) , a fortress (two lines), and ancholes (also two lines, but dilapidated or collapsed). After the devastating fires of 1700 and 1703, a new fortress (the so-called \\"earthen\\") of 1704-1706 was built in the city. Its remains were discovered during the archaeological excavations of 2013‚Äì2014 on Khlebnaya Square.  Later centuries  In the spring of 1646, the first household census of Samara was carried out with the suburb, the only settlement at that moment - Boldyrskaya - and the county (there is information about the early formation of the nobility around the city of Samara, and previous censuses). Thus, the fortress of Samara had all the rights of the city since its foundation in 1586. In 1708 Samara - the ninth city of Kazan province . Since 1719, Samara belongs to the Astrakhan province . Since 1728 Samara once again belongs to the Kazan province . Since 1780, Samara belongs to Simbirsk governorship . Since 1796, Samara belongs to Simbirsk province . In 1851, Samara - the provincial capital and the capital of the Samara province, numbering 15 thousand people. Since then, the city began to flourish; He was known as the \\"Russian Chicago\\" due to giant mills, numerous small factory, barns. In the city there were 375 trade shops, and the Samara province was the leader in the number of wheat collected in the Russian Empire . Since 1928, Samara becomes the center of the Middle Volga region . Since 1929, Samara is the center of the Middle Volga region . In 1935, Samara was renamed Kuibyshev, part of the Kuibyshev region . Since 1936, Kuibyshev (Samara) is the center of the Kuibyshev region . In 1990, Samara returned the historical name, the city is the center of the Samara Oblast.  Modern period  On June 8, 1918, deputies of the All-Russian Constituent Assembly formed in Samara a government independent of the Bolshevik government . It was called the Committee of the Members of the Constituent Assembly (Comouch). The chairman is Vladimir Volsky, a deputy from the Socialist Revolutionary Party . In 1935, Samara was renamed Kuibyshev. During the Great Patriotic War, Samara (then Kuibyshev) was actually the second capital of the USSR: the Government, diplomatic missions and many enterprises evacuated from the western regions (located mainly on Bezymyanka ) were located here. The level of industrial production increased 5.5 times by 1945 compared with 1940. For the Supreme Commander Stalin, a spare residence was built, now known as the Stalin Bunker, and available for visiting by excursion groups. The Bolshoi Theater worked in evacuation in Kuibyshev; here the seventh Leningrad symphony by D. D. Shostakovich was written and first performed .

She was the film critic for the Daily Worker (subsequently known as the Morning Star) from 1960 to 1971, and also wrote reviews for The Lady. After retiring from journalism, she became the first person to work in the position of films officer for the Yorkshire Arts Association. During the late 1970s, she was program director of the BFI-aligned Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle upon Tyne. She is the author of Eastern Europe: An Illustrated Guide and co-author (with her daughter, film producer Sally Hibbin) of What a Carry On ‚Äì The Official Story of the Carry On Films. Hibbin was a staunch communist and ensured that her reviews conveyed her political convictions. Writing in The Guardian shortly after her death, film critic Derek Malcolm said: \\"She will be remembered for her passionate advocacy of east European cinema, her hatred of the censorship sometimes imposed on it by regimes with no taste for rebellious art, and for her many campaigns to persuade British distributors to screen what was then called third-world cinema.\\" In 2019, Ranker listed Nina Hibbin at number 15 in its list of \\"Famous Female Film Critics\\". Childhood and early career Hibbin was born in Romford, Essex. Her family were Jewish and originated from Eastern Europe. At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Hibbin began working as an investigator for the Mass- Observation (MO) research organisation. She first reported on the British public's reaction to posters about the war. She went on to write studies on antisemitism in London's East End, conditions in the city's air-raid shelters, and the role of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). She worked as an observer in the East End throughout the early part of the war, engaging citizens in casual conversation to ascertain morale and the effectiveness of the government's security measures. She was highly opposed to the MO's ties with the Ministry of Information, however, describing the link as an \\"act of betrayal\\". She resigned from the job in 1941, out of protest at what she saw as the ministry's manipulation of her reports, and once the opportunity came for women to enlist in military units on the home front. Hibbin welcomed the opportunities presented by the war and enlisted in the WAAF. She later said: \\"Before the war, there was virtually no way well-brought-up young women could leave home and the prospect was simply that you got married to leave home. And now suddenly there was this possibility of joining the WAAF ... [We] knew we would learn a trade, we would travel, and ... just the mere fact of leaving home meant a lot, being free from the chores that were expected of women ...\\" She worked as a mechanic on Spitfire fighter planes at RAF Hendon, north of London. A contributor to Picture Post magazine, Hibbin wrote captions for photographs of working people. Her socialist convictions were further reflected in her authorship of reports for the London Workers' Film Society and a conference paper at the International Film Festival in Moscow and at the Symposium in Repino, Leningrad. Hibbin was disappointed that, with the end of hostilities, women's opportunities in the armed services evaporated. After demobbing from the WAAF, Hibbin trained as a teacher at Dartington Hall, near Totnes in Devon. She then taught at a school in Cornwall, where here communist sympathies proved controversial. She returned to London in the early 1950s. Film criticism In 1960, Hibbin became a member of the Critics' Circle, the national professional body of critics for dance, drama, film, music, visual arts and architecture. She began working as the film critic for the communist Daily Worker newspaper (retitled the Morning Star in 1966). Despite its political slant, she also wrote film reviews for The Lady. She became a familiar sight, travelling to screenings in London on her motorbike. Hibbin's contributions to the Daily Worker and the Morning Star reflected her strident opinions on cinema and politics. In a June 1964 article on the critical reception given to The Finest Hours, a documentary about Winston Churchill, The New York Times reported: \\"Nina Hibbin of the Daily Worker took exception to the scant mention of the part the Soviet Union played in the war. 'The battle of Stalingrad, it now appears, was won by the weather,' she wrote.\\" Her review of Come Back, Africa ‚Äì in which she described the film as \\"the most damning indictment of apartheid and the pass system that I have ever seen\\" and asked, \\"How long are we going to allow these appalling conditions to exist?\\" ‚Äì ensured that the Daily Worker fully embraced the anti-apartheid cause. She described Lindsay Anderson's If ... as a \\"devastating view ... of the cruel traditions which go into the shaping of the ruling class\\" and judged it \\"the best and most significant film of the Sixties\\". Derek Malcolm wrote in 2004 that Hibbin's reviews were \\"full of her sympathy for working people and against what she saw as the soul-destroying glibness of Hollywood\\". She also lobbied British film distributors to release films from Eastern Europe and lesser-known countries, as well as titles such as Ken Loach's Kes. In 1969, she authored the book Eastern Europe: An Illustrated Guide. She decided to abandon film criticism in 1971. Later career and retirement Hibbin became the first-ever films officer for the Yorkshire Arts Association, a role in which she awarded grants to local filmmakers. From 1976 to 1979, she was director of the BFI-aligned Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle upon Tyne. She oversaw a program of films combining populist and more progressive tastes. One early critic of her program bemoaned the preponderance of \\"films about tractor collectives in the Ukraine\\". Hibbin's directorship nevertheless led to healthy audience numbers at the Tyneside, a trend that continued under her successor, Sheila Whitaker. Hibbin retired and moved to Boulby, near Staithes in North Yorkshire. There, she and her husband Eric ran a caf√© beside the Cleveland Way, a popular walking track. She edited two books of poetry by local writers. In 1988, she and her daughter, Sally Hibbin, co-wrote a book about the Carry On film series titled What a Carry On ‚Äì The Official Story of the Carry On Films. In 2001, she moved to Saltburn. In her final years, she was afflicted with heart disease, emphysema, kidney failure and cancer. On her death in May 2004, she was survived by her daughter Sally, a film producer.

He and others in his family were renowned and patronized by royalty for their creation of great fireworks extravaganzas. They also opened a public pleasure garden where fireworks displays could be enjoyed by the people of Paris. The Ruggieris introduced a style of fireworks that was theatrical rather than being based on military gunnery. Following a disastrous fireworks accident on May 30, 1770, the Ruggieris fell from favor. Claude-Fortun√© Ruggieri was primarily responsible for restoring the family to its position of prominence. He used the new science of chemistry to develop novel fireworks, in particular colored fireworks that distinguished the Ruggieris from their rivals. He discovered a way to reliably create a vivid \\"green fire\\" observed in Russian fireworks. In his writings, Claude Ruggieri discussed \\"aerial philosophy\\", the composition and reactions of gases or \\"airs\\". He emphasized the importance of chemistry as a form of theoretical knowledge and connected it to the artisanal practices of pyrotechnics. Claude Ruggieri was a friend of Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin, the Official Aeronaut of France, and experimented with both balloons and rockets. Ruggieri is credited with being the first person to use rockets to transport living passengers aloft. His passengers were mostly mice and rats, but also sheep. He used parachutes to return them safely to the earth.  Family  Claude-Eug√®ne-Fortun√© Ruggieri was born in 1777, to Petronio and Jeanne-Elizabeth Ruggieri. The Ruggieris were an Italian family who had become naturalized citizens of France. The five Ruggieri brothers (Antonio, Francesco, Gaetano, Petronio and Pietro) left Bologna, Italy, for Paris, France, in 1743. They came from a tradition in which fireworks were used as part of theatre, and accompanied the Com√©die Italienne to Paris. Their spectacles pyriques, fireworks mounted on fixed and moving iron armatures, were set off between acts of the theatrical performance. Soon the displays became entertainments in their own right, carefully crafted presentations that referenced history and mythology. Royal Fire-workes and Illuminations in Whitehall and on the River Thames, for King George II of Great Britain, May 15, 1749 The Ruggieris were appointed artificiers du Roi to King Louis XV. The family thrived as fireworks pyrotechnicians under the patronage of royalty. Louis XV (1710‚Äì1774) patronized the elder Ruggieri brothers. Gaetano Ruggieri served King George II of Great Britain. Petronio Ruggieri (‚àí1794) had two sons, Michel-Marie (‚àí1849) and Claude-Fortun√©. Michel-Marie and Claude-Fortun√© designed and exploded elaborate fireworks displays for Napoleon I, Louis XVIII, and Charles X. In August 1764, Giovani Battista Torre (aka Jean- Baptiste Torr√©) established a pleasure garden on the boulevard Saint-Martin in Paris. It was known as the Waux-hall de Torr√©, or Waux-hall d'√©t√©, after Vauxhall Gardens in London. Torr√© held public fireworks displays that included artificial volcanoes. In 1766, Pietro Ruggieri became the \\"dignified rival\\" of Torre by opening his own Jardin Ruggieri at 20, rue Neuve-Saint-Lazare, catering to the Parisien public. After his death in 1778, ownership passed to his brother Petronio. It was taken over by Michel-Marie and Claude-Fortun√© Ruggieri in 1794. In subsequent generations, Michel's son Fran√ßois Ruggieri (1796‚Äì1862) served as a pyrotechnician to Mehemet Ali, viceroy of Egypt. Claude-Fortun√©'s son, D√©sir√©-Fran√ßois Ruggieri (1818‚Äì1885) became the head of the family business in France, acting as a pyrotechnician for Napoleon III. The Ruggieri family business is still in operation in France.  Work  = Fireworks = On May 30, 1770, a display planned by Petronio Ruggieri to celebrate the marriage of the future Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette ended in a disastrous accident. In response, the City of Paris slashed its budget for fireworks, cutting off the Ruggieri family's main source of income. Claude- Fortun√© Ruggieri was primarily responsible for restoring the family to a position of prominence, by using the new science of chemistry to develop novel fireworks that distinguished the Ruggieris from their rivals. Ruggieri was a leader in prioritizing color as an important element of fireworks displays, and emphasized the importance of chemistry as a theoretical basis for creating colored fireworks: Before Ruggieri, the default color for fireworks was a brilliant \\"white fire\\", also known as \\"natural fire\\". Practitioners sometimes attempted to color their fireworks, generally by adding materials of the target color (e.g. indigo for blue), achieving at best a faint coloration. The Ruggieris first attempted to develop colored fire in 1766 with the help of chemist Antoine Lavoisier. Lavoisier reported only very limited success in his attempts to make yellow, blue, and green fire. There were reports that a brilliant \\"green fire\\" had been created in the 1700s, most successfully by Mikhail Vasil'evich Danilov and Matvei Martynov at the Russian court. However, other practitioners found it difficult to recreate such effects. In 1804, after hearing a first-person account of Russian green fire, Claude Ruggieri began to experiment with the addition of metallic salts to create colored flames. Ruggieri claimed to first use green fire publicly in June 1810, as part of a fireworks display for the marriage of Napoleon I and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. Drawing for the temple of Hymen, a firework display to celebrate the marriage of Napoleon and Marie Louise at the Residence of Princess Pauline Borgh√®se, the Palais De Neuilly, 1810 Ruggieri wrote a number of works which were translated into English and German as well as being published in French. Ruggieri's first book, El√©mens De Pyrotechnie (1801, 1811, 1821) was dedicated to Jean-Antoine Chaptal, the author of El√©mens De Chimie, and a minister in Napoleon's government. In this way, Ruggieri aligned himself with a post-revolutionary view of science. Chaptal was a proponent of a \\"new man\\" who connected theoretical knowledge and artisanal skills. El√©mens De Pyrotechnie was filled with discussions of chemistry and physics. Ruggieri discussed \\"aerial philosophy\\", drawing on some of Joseph Priestley's ideas about the composition and reactions of gases or \\"airs\\". However, Ruggieri did not identify key differences between Phlogiston theory and Lavoisier's Caloric theory of combustion. At the same time, the book is filled with practical descriptions and detailed diagrams about the construction and use of fireworks. Writing in 1922, Alan Brock describes Ruggieri as \\"the first author to deal with the subject in such a way as to convince the professional reader of the practical knowledge of the subject.\\" File:Ruggieri El√©mens De Pyrotechnie 1811 Title Page b1071419 001 tif np193999d.tiff El√©mens De Pyrotechnie, title page, 1811 File:Ruggieri El√©mens De Pyrotechnie 1811 Plate 01 b1071419 002 tif g158bj006.tiffPlate 1, Laboratory bench equipment File:Ruggieri El√©mens De Pyrotechnie 1811 Plate 25 b1071419 026 tif 0g354f98q.tiff Plate 25, Armatures for fireworks File:Ruggieri El√©mens De Pyrotechnie 1811 Plate 26 b1071419 027 tif 2j62s563b.tiff Plate 26, Palm tree of green fire = Balloons, rockets and parachutes = Claude Ruggieri was a friend of Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin, the Official Aeronaut of France, who held balloon ascensions in the Ruggieri's pleasure garden. In 1801, Garnerin and Ruggieri celebrated Bastille Day with a combined balloon ascension and fireworks display. In addition to experimenting with balloons, Claude Ruggieri used rockets to transport living passengers aloft and parachutes to return them safely to the earth. As early as 1806, Ruggieri sent mice and rats up in rockets, recovering them through the use of parachutes. He also apparently sent a sheep about 600 feet up in the air, bringing it back down with parachutes. As a result, Ruggieri is credited with being the first person to use rockets to carry living creatures. In 1830, Ruggieri announced that he would use a large cluster of rockets to lift a larger animal, a ram, into the air. A young man (perhaps as young as 11) apparently offered to replace the ram as a passenger in the test. Plans were made for him to ascend from the Champ de Mars. However, French authorities intervened and canceled the flight, apparently due to the volunteer's youth.  Death  Ruggieri died at number 88, Rue de Clichy, Paris, France, on August 30, 1841. His widow was Catherine Antoinette Lagrange whom he had married in 1819.  Publications  * Editions appeared in 1801, 1811, and 1821.

Antibiotics can be divided into broad- spectrum antibiotics, extended-spectrum antibiotics and narrow-spectrum antibiotics based on their spectrum of activity. Detailedly, broad-spectrum antibiotics can kill or inhibit a wide range of microorganisms; extended- spectrum antibiotic can kill or inhibit Gram positive bacteria and some Gram negative bacteria; narrow-spectrum antibiotic can only kill or inhibit limited species of bacteria. Currently no antibiotic's spectrum can completely cover all types of microorganisms. Determination The antimicrobial spectrum of an antibiotic can be determined by testing its antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microbes in vitro . Nonetheless, the range of microorganisms which an antibiotic can kill or inhibit in vivo may not always be the same as the antimicrobial spectrum based on data collected in vitro. Significance Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have low propensity to induce bacterial resistance and are less likely to disrupt the microbiome (normal microflora). On the other hand, indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may not only induce the development of bacterial resistance and promote the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, but also cause off-target effects due to dysbiosis. They may also have side effects, such as diarrhea or rash. Generally, a broad antibiotic has more clinical indications, and therefore are more widely used. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommends the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever possible.

Joseph Edward (Eddie) Nuttgens (1892 ‚Äì 1982) was a stained glass designer who worked mainly on church windows. He was born in Aachen, the eldest child of six born to a German tailor‚Äôs cutter, Heinrich/Henry Nuttgens, and an English mother, Teresa Mary Canham. The family moved to London in 1895. Because he had a German father, he was interned during World War 1 and was asked to resign from his position as Head of the Stained Glass Department of the Royal College of Art in 1918, despite having an English mother and having lived in Britain since the age of three. He married Kathleen Mary Clarke in 1924 and they had five children, but she died in 1937. Nuttgens married Daphne Reid in 1940, sister of ‚ÄòThe Colditz Story‚Äô author Pat Reid, and they had eight more children. Joseph E Nuttgens was the father of Patrick Nuttgens, architect and academic; Joseph Ambrose Nuttgens, stained glass designer; John Nuttgens, ceramicist; Susan Nuttgens, ceramicist; Alice Nuttgens, saddler and leather worker. He was also the grandfather of the cinematographer Giles Nuttgens, the composer Sandy Nuttgens, the broadcaster Peg Alexander and 41 further grandchildren, among them, artists, musicians, chefs, broadcasters, entrepreneurs, and naturalists. Nuttgens left school in 1906, aged 14 years, and learnt drawing in evening classes at Harrow Technical College and School of Art (now part of the University of Westminster). After a couple of jobs involving drawing and stencil cutting, his first job in stained glass was with Arthur Orr, for whom he was his first assistant in a new studio, and for whom he worked for 5 years. In 1911, he began studying at the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now the Central School of Art and Design) in Southampton Row, London, under Christopher Whall from whom he developed the idea that the art, design and craftsmanship of a piece should be executed as far as possible by one person as part of a 'living tradition'. In this respect he was influenced by the philosophy and style of Edward Burne Jones and William Morris and other members of the Arts and Crafts Movement. He subsequently worked at Lowndes and Drury‚Äôs Glass House in Fulham, London, under Karl Parsons and Martin Travers. In addition to having the talent and skill to create whole works of his own, he was also able to adapt other people's drawings for creation as stained glass works, to produce designs for other glassmakers including, for example, James Powell and Sons and to create glass works designed by other people, including, for example, Herbert Hendrie. He then moved to Chipping Camden in Gloucestershire to work for Paul Woodroffe and then to Cobbler's Hill in the Chilterns Hills. Later he moved to North Dean near Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire and then set up his own studio at Piggott‚Äôs Hill near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. His son, Joseph Ambrose Nuttgens, continued as a stained glass designer, at North Dean and at Piggott's Hill, after his father‚Äôs death. Chipping Camden was the home of many artists and craftsmen and Piggott‚Äôs Hill was associated with many artists who, like Nuttgens, were Roman Catholics. Piggott‚Äôs Hill was near the studio where Eric Gill lived in later life. Through Gill's influence, Nuttgens developed an interest in Catholic Distributism, an economic philosophy extolling the virtues of small enterprises and self-sufficiency. The church of St Peter, Gorleston, Norfolk, the only church designed by Gill and completed just before his death in 1937, contains an East Window made by Nuttgens and installed in 1963. Nuttgens was also associated with the Art Workers Guild, based on the precepts of the Arts and Crafts Movement, and the Warham Guild, which was dedicated to the production of church decorations and ornaments and was a Fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters. Nuttgens was an important influence on other stained glass makers including John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens, whose partnership began in his studio. Reyntiens described his teacher, Nuttgens, as 'the best painter on glass of his own and subsequent generations'. North nave, sixth window, St Mark's Church, Staplefield, Sussex Nuttgens had a long career, producing about 300 stained glass windows entirely by his own hand, as well as countless drawings, designs and glass work for other artists. Most of his windows were for British churches, with a few being for churches all over the world. About two thirds were for Anglican churches, the remainder being for Roman Catholic churches. His work was coherent over time although his style showed considerable development across his long career. His work from the beginning of his professional life at the end of the First World War to near the beginning of the Second World War carries traces of the style, as well as the philosophy, of the Arts and Crafts Movement, see for example, windows in St. Barnabas Nottingham Roman Catholic Cathedral (installed 1948) and St. Teresa‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire (1938-1944). During the Second World War there was little opportunity to work in stained glass and from time to time Nuttgens was obliged to take on manual labour. After the Second World War, there was more demand for stained glass, especially for War Memorials and other post-war regeneration projects. These projects included, for example, replacing the windows in the bomb damaged St. Etheldreda‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church in Ely Place, London (1952) where Nuttgens made the large East window and his colleague, Charles F. Blakeman, made the side windows. When viewing its installation, Bernard Rackham (then curator of the Victoria and Albert Museum) described this East Window as an 'excellent illustration of the adaptation to modern ideas of a superb medieval art' . Some of Nuttgens post-war work, such as the south window in St. Andrew‚Äôs Parish Church, Soham, Cambridgeshire (1957) had a bold but colourful simplicity which indicated considerable progression from his pre-war style. Nuttgens gained an international reputation and made windows for a number of churches abroad including St John‚Äôs Cathedral in Hong Kong (1958). He replaced the windows which had originally been created by William Morris's firm but which were destroyed during the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong. A few weeks before his death in 1982, Nuttgens completed the designs for a work based entirely on wild flowers which had been commissioned by Linda McCartney (first wife of Paul McCartney). The work was completed by his son, Joe Ambrose Nuttgens. Nuttgens is buried in Speen Baptist Churchyard, near High Wycombe, alongside his wife Daphne Margaret Nuttgens.

Alex Springer, for SLUG Magazine, wrote \\"where most campaigns tend to begin in some kind of neutral, relatively safe location, Storm King‚Äôs Thunder thrusts our intrepid adventurers into a recently sieged village that is being picked apart by goblins. [...] Allowing the players to shift gears and take the role of a relatively normal person in the middle of a city-wide attack lets players experience the fantastic world of Dungeons & Dragons from the eyes of a civilian. In a game that expects its players to become superheroes, it was a nice dose of reality to see what it‚Äôs like to face a supernatural being without the benefit of supernatural powers. As we continued through the campaign, I was impressed at how well Storm King‚Äôs Thunder balanced structure with improvisational freedom. [...] We‚Äôre not talking about generic ‚Äúgo fetch‚Äù missions or cleansing ruin after ruin of its monstrous occupants, either‚Äîone chance encounter finds the players manipulating a lovesick hill giant into betraying her husband-stealing queen. Based on my experience running Storm King‚Äôs Thunder as a novice DM, I continue to be impressed with the quality of work that Wizards of the Coast puts into their roleplaying game peripherals. The art is fantastic, the maps are meticulous and all of it is set against a Shakespearean story of corruption, betrayal and power\\". Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, wrote \\"reading through Storm King‚Äôs Thunder for the first time gave me the strongest itch that I have ever had to actually put a party through a pre- created adventure. The adventure is created in such a way that any given location contains a dozen plot hooks, interesting characters, and beautiful descriptions that would be suitable for an entire campaign. [...] It‚Äôs hard to be specific here without stealing some of the wonder, but let me tell you about some of the things I found to be the most wonderful in Storm King‚Äôs Thunder. There‚Äôs a 40,000+ year old kraken wizard who hangs out in the ocean using its telekinetic powers to lure people into its service from hundreds of miles away. There‚Äôs a fire giant who wants to reassemble a magical Voltron to punch dragons in the mouth with. [...] Of course, there are parts I don‚Äôt enjoy as much. Storm King‚Äôs Thunder is very equitable when it comes to gender, with many giant lords being women and the gender assignment of many NPCs being up to DM discretion. However, that macro plot I mentioned before starts off with a old-fashioned fridging of King Hekton‚Äôs wife Queen Neri, and it‚Äôs such a conspicuous, trope-y stumble that I initially assumed that it was meant to be commentary of some kind (as far as I can tell, though, it‚Äôs just a plot point)\\". Cecilia D'Anastasio, for Kotaku in a review comparing Out of the Abyss and Storm King‚Äôs Thunder, wrote \\"after a few pages of lore and history about the giants of the Forgotten Realms, Chapter One starts players in a deserted settlement infested with goblins. [...] The only real hook into Storm King‚Äôs Thunder‚Äôs opening moments is the bell ringing from the bell tower, where goblins are gleefully swinging on a rope. There it was: the easy opening. Go to the bell tower. Explore the town. [...] Players got a strong sense of each others‚Äô characters by exploring the empty settlement. It's just a start, but the simplicity of Storm King‚Äôs Thunder‚Äôs first chapter made it fun. The experience of it wasn‚Äôt prescribed, and players weren‚Äôt made servile by ten NPCs, four hanging towers and thirteen fungi. Later on, when shit gets real in the Savage Frontier, I welcome the new Dungeons & Dragons adventure to throw what it‚Äôs got at us. The first chapter isn‚Äôt the time for that. The lack of content in the intro to Storm King‚Äôs Thunder, for some, was also paralyzing. [...] But I‚Äôd rather players meet the challenge of creativity than suffocate in the embrace of a too-meaty adventure. At least we‚Äôre picking up the game again\\". James Haeck, for Geek & Sundry, wrote \\"before we can see why Roll20 does Storm King‚Äôs Thunder so well, let‚Äôs talk about the adventure itself. Storm King‚Äôs Thunder is technically a sequel to 5e‚Äôs first story arc, Tyranny of Dragons, in the way that Captain America: Civil War is a sequel to Age of Ultron. You don‚Äôt need to have played or even read Tyranny to ‚Äúget‚Äù this adventure, but you'll enjoy some easter eggs. This adventure is also shorter than the others. [...] I still prefer the tactile sensation of flipping pages [...] but Roll20‚Äôs GM tools are startlingly useful. I love showing my players images from the adventure, for instance. All of the illustrations that you'd find in the book are loaded into Roll20‚Äôs image database, and it's much easier to just click a ‚Äúshare with everyone‚Äù button than to awkwardly turn the hardcover around, try (and fail) to cover the spoilery text, and probably break the book‚Äôs binding in the process. The interactive Table of Contents makes flipping through Roll20‚Äôs format infinitely easier than leafing through a print book. It's even easier than using a PDF with a hyperlinked Table of Contents, since you can always pop it open from the right-hand sidebar without closing your other open windows. A small negative; the adventure frequently mentions Player‚Äôs Handbook or Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide, not by page number, but by chapter number. And since they can't hyperlink to those books, it's a small grievance, but one with cascading effects\\".

It was published on September 17, 2019 (Constitution Day), by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt and Company. The book describes Snowden's childhood as well as his tenure at the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and his motivations for the leaking of highly classified information in 2013 that revealed global surveillance programs. Snowden also discusses his views on authoritarianism, democracy and privacy. The writer Joshua Cohen is credited by Snowden for \\"helping to transform my rambling reminiscences and capsule manifestoes into a book.\\" Upon release, the United States filed a lawsuit against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA. The lawsuit did not aim to restrict the book's content or distribution, but to capture the proceeds Snowden earns from it. In December 2019, U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady ruled in favor of the U.S. government. Permanent Record has been censored in China, with the removed content including comments about authoritarian states, privacy-supporting technologies, and the right to privacy.  Summary  = Part One = Snowden recounts growing up in a patriotic military family in Elizabeth City, North Carolina and moving to Crofton, Maryland just shy of his ninth birthday. In Crofton, his father worked as a chief warrant officer in the Aeronautical Engineering Division at Coast Guard Headquarters and his mother at the National Security Agency (NSA). He was introduced to computers by his father, using his Commodore 64 home computer. From around the age of twelve he became obsessed with the internet, using a dial-up Internet access and trying to spend his \\"every waking moment\\" online. He eventually learned computer programming and became a hacker as a teenager, taking his focus away from his schoolwork to the detriment of his grades. He recalls one instance of discovering a security flaw on the website of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He called the lab to notify them of this and later received a call from a man thanking him and offering a job once he turned 18. Toward the end of his freshman year at Arundel High School, Snowden's parents were getting divorced and sold their Crofton house. He moved into his mother's condo near Ellicott City. At the beginning of his sophomore year, he was unusually fatigued and was eventually diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis. He missed four months of classes, and was told he would have to repeat his sophomore year. Instead, he dropped out of Arundel High and enrolled at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC), taking classes two days a week. He also later passed the General Education Development (GED) exams at a high school near Baltimore, a promise he made to himself when he dropped out. Snowden started freelancing as a web designer for a woman from his Japanese class at AACC. He wanted to advance his career further, taking a Microsoft certification course at the Computer Career Institute of a Johns Hopkins University satellite campus. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Snowden joined the United States Army to show he wasn't \\"just a brain in a jar\\" and was on track to become a Special Forces sergeant through the 18X enlistment option but suffered stress fractures during training at Fort Benning in Georgia. Snowden says his greatest regret was his own \\"reflexive, unquestioning support\\" for the War on Terror and the resulting \\"promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars.\\" Snowden first became interested in computers by using his father's Commodore 64 home computer. Snowden still wanted to serve his country and realized he had taken his talent for technology for granted, and began taking classes again at Anne Arundel Community College. Knowing he would need a high-level security clearance to work for an intelligence agency, he searched for jobs that would sponsor his application for the Single Scope Background Investigation. He became an employee at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Study of Language, a research center sponsored by the NSA. Around the same time, he met his then-girlfriend Lindsay Mills through the site Hot or Not. He eventually passed the full-scope polygraph and successfully attained the TS/SCI security clearance, completing his final interview at the NSA's Friendship Annex when he was twenty-two years old. = Part Two = After attending a 2006 job fair at the Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA and was assigned to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA. Shortly after, Snowden took a job as contractor for the NSA in Japan, but was officially an employee of Perot Systems (which was acquired by Dell soon after his arrival). He worked at the NSA's Pacific Technical Center (PTC), at Yokota Air Base. His job there was \\"helping to connect the NSA's systems architecture with the CIA's.\\" On one occasion, the PTC hosted a conference featuring briefings given by experts from all the intelligence components. The conference concerned how the Chinese intelligence services were targeting the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and how the IC could respond. When the only technology briefer was unable to attend at the last minute, Snowden was selected to replace them in assessing China's surveillance capabilities. He stayed up all night preparing his presentation, sifting through top secret reports off the NSA network and the CIA network. He was stunned by the extent to which China was able to constantly collect, store, and analyze the billions of daily telephone and Internet communications of their over a billion citizenry. However, Snowden began to believe that it was impossible for the US to have so much information about what the Chinese were doing without having done some of the very same things itself. Snowden, however, admits that at the time he \\"tamped down\\" his unease and fully supported defensive and targeted surveillance. He was further suspicious when he, around the same time, read the Unclassified Report on the President's Surveillance Program. His suspicion drove him to search for the classified report, but was unable to find it. It was only later, long after he had forgotten about it, that the classified version mistakenly appeared on his desktop. After reading the report, he says he spent months in a sad, low daze: Snowden moved to Columbia, Maryland in 2011, still working for Dell but now attached again to the CIA. He had switched to a sales position, a move which he describes as a way to distract himself from his unease and begin to have a normal life. However, the rise of cloud computing disturbed Snowden. He began expressing his concerns to Lindsay. Around the same time, Snowden began experiencing intense dizziness and, eventually, his first epileptic seizure. Following a series of seizures, Snowden took a short- term disability leave from Dell. The final chapter of Part Two, \\"On the Couch\\", describes his time spent recovering on his mother's blue couch as well his thoughts on authoritarian states and privacy in the context of the 2011 Arab Spring. = Part Three = In March 2012, he began working at \\"the Tunnel\\", a former aircraft factory turned NSA facility located under a pineapple field in Kunia, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. He was working on a Dell contract for the NSA. Snowden moved to Hawaii for the more relaxed lifestyle and the less stressful duties of his new position, in an effort to lessen the triggers of his seizures. He was the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, where he worked as a SharePoint systems administrator. He began actively searching for the NSA's surveillance capabilities and abuses at this time. As part of his work, Snowden developed a system called Heartbeat which created an automated queue from the classified documents posted to the Intelligence Community's \\"readboards\\". Heartbeat would perpetually scan for new and unique documents and create a kind of aggregated newsfeed personalized for each employee, based on their interests and their security clearance. Heartbeat was highly comprehensive, accessing beyond the NSA's network into the networks of the CIA and the FBI as well as into the Department of Defense‚Äôs top-secret Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System. Heartbeat's servers stored a copy of each scanned document, allowing Snowden to \\"perform the kind of deep interagency searches that the heads of most agencies could only dream of.\\" Snowden says that nearly all of the documents that he later leaked to journalists were received through Heartbeat. Edward Snowden's former house in Waipahu, Hawaii. In \\"Whistleblowing\\", Snowden discusses the Constitution of the United States and argues that the Intelligence Community have \\"hacked\\" it by acting with impunity from the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch. He also discusses the history of whistleblowing and argues that the terms \\"leaking\\" and \\"whistleblowing\\" should not be used interchangeably because he believes \\"leaking\\" is done out of self-interest, not out of public interest. When Snowden decided to go public, he realized he would have to have documentation or he risked being doubted. He chose not to self-publish to avoid being \\"lost among the crazy\\" of people posting classified secrets to the Internet every day. He avoided WikiLeaks because he felt their new strategy of publishing leaks as they received them would be no different to him self-publishing. He felt a document dump was not appropriate as his leaks were too \\"tangled and technical\\". He considered The New York Times but was unimpressed with how Bill Keller intentionally delayed the reporting of the Terrorist Surveillance Program until after George W. Bush's 2004 reelection. He chose a number of journalists to contact, primarily messaging documentarian Laura Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald. He communicated with them over e-mail under the aliases \\"Cincinnatus\\", \\"Citizenfour\\" and \\"Verax\\". To stay anonymous, he went war-driving, exploiting local Wi-Fi networks with an antenna and magnetic GPS sensor while driving in his car around Oahu. He used Tor and the Kismet mapping software, running on the Tails operating system which allowed him to easily spoof his laptop's MAC address. Under the guise of compatibility testing, Snowden transferred documents from the Heartbeat server to outdated desktop Dell PCs from his office, then onto SD cards after deduplicating, compressing and encrypting them. He carried the SD cards out through security, hiding them inside a Rubik's Cube, in his sock, in his cheek, and in his pocket. At home, he transferred them onto a single external drive which he left out in the open on his desk. He left Dell on March 15, 2013 and began working as an \\"infrastructure analyst\\" at the National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) in Honolulu through a contractor job at Booz Allen Hamilton. The NTOC had access to XKEYSCORE. Snowden witnessed coworkers use XKEYSCORE to view information about their current and former lovers, called LOVEINT. He also recalls one time that affected him, watching a personal video of a father and his young son. Between March‚ÄìMay 2013, Snowden began rapidly preparing to leave the country, emptying his bank accounts and erasing and encrypting his old computers. He researched his safest and most conducive destination, narrowing it down to Hong Kong. The day after Lindsay left on a camping trip, Snowden took an emergency medical leave of absence from work, citing epilepsy. He brought four laptops with him: one for secure communications, one for normal communications, a decoy, and a laptop that had never connected to any networks and would never be used to do so. He flew to Tokyo then to Hong Kong on May 20, 2013, paying in cash both times. He stayed in The Mira Hong Kong hotel, where Glenn and Laura met him on June 2, 2013. Between June 3 and 9 in Snowden's hotel room, Glenn and his Guardian colleague Ewen MacAskill interviewed Snowden, with Laura filming what later featured in her Academy Award-winning documentary Citizenfour (2014). On June 5, The Guardian published Glenn's first story, on the FISA court warrant that ordered Verizon to provide a daily feed to the NSA containing \\"telephony metadata\\". On June 6, The Guardian published Glenn's revelation of PRISM and The Washington Post published Laura and Barton Gellman's story on PRISM on June 7. Snowden's identity was revealed on June 9 through a video interview directed by Laura published on The Guardians website. The U.S. government charged Snowden under the Espionage Act on June 14 and formally requested his extradition on June 21, Snowden's 30th birthday. Accompanied by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks, Snowden attempted to travel to Ecuador for political asylum. They planned to fly to Moscow, then to Havana, then to Caracas, then to Quito, Ecuador because they were unable to fly directly from Hong Kong and all of the other connecting flights traveled through United States airspace. They arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport on June 23, but were taken aside and questioned by a man from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). The man asked Snowden to work for them, but Snowden rejected the offer and said he had no intention to stay in Russia. The man was surprised and informed Snowden that the U.S. State Department had canceled his passport. He proceeded to ask Snowden to share information with them but he refused. Snowden was detained in Sheremetyevo for forty days, during which he applied to twenty-seven countries for political asylum but none offered. On August 1, the Russian government granted Snowden temporary asylum. The book's penultimate 28th chapter is composed of entries from Lindsay Mills's 2013 diary. Snowden explained that no one but her had the experience or the right to recount that period of her life: \\"the FBI interrogations, the surveillance, the press attention, the online harassment, the confusion and pain, the anger and sadness.\\" In the final chapter, \\"Love and Exile\\", Snowden expresses his feelings on the impact of his revelations, including ACLU v. Clapper and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, and his hopes for the future of technology and privacy. He also discusses adjusting to life in Moscow with Lindsay. In the chapter's final sentence, Snowden reveals he and Lindsay were married in 2017.  Civil lawsuit  On September 17, 2019, the Federal Government of the United States filed a lawsuit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA. The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir Permanent Record. The complaint lists the publishers Macmillan and Holtzbrink as relief defendants. The government stated that its lawsuit \\"does not seek to stop or restrict the publication or distribution\\" of the book, but instead aims to capture the proceeds Snowden would be earning from it. In December 2019, Judge Liam O'Grady concurred with the plaintiff. Snowden refused during the civil lawsuit to produce documents showing how much he was paid. As a result, federal prosecutors sought sanctions against Snowden. On August 7, 2020, U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan agreed to impose sanctions on Snowden, ruling that he \\"unequivocally acted in bad faith\\". Snowden himself referred to the lawsuit on an episode of The Daily Show, stating it was largely responsible for the book's increased sales via the Streisand effect.  Publication  The book was published on September 17, 2019, by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt and Company. It was purposely published on September 17 to coincide with Constitution Day, which Snowden discusses in the book. On October 6, 2019, the book debuted at number two on The New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction best-sellers list and at number two on the Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction best-sellers list.  Censorship  On November 11, 2019, Snowden posted on his Twitter that the simplified Chinese edition of Permanent Record, published in mainland China, had been censored. Parts of the book were removed, in violation of his publishing agreement. The Chinese version removed Snowden's observation on the motivations of Arab Spring protestors: \\"The crowds were calling for an end to oppression, censorship, and precarity. They were declaring that in a truly just society, the people were not answerable to the government, the government was answerable to the people.\\" The following section, in which Snowden comments on the nature of authoritarian states, was also largely censored. In the section, Snowden writes, \\"Authoritarian states are typically not governments of laws, but governments of leaders, who demand loyalty from their subjects and are hostile to dissent.\\" The Chinese version also censored Snowden's references to the Tor anonymity network, China's military cyber intelligence and its capabilities, China's Great Firewall, as well Snowden's characterization of Hong Kong as having \\"nominal autonomy\\". The Chinese version censored topics not directly related to China as well, including Snowden's commentary on the right to privacy. Snowden invited his Twitter followers to help him create a \\"correct and unabridged version\\" of Permanent Record in Chinese to be published freely online.  Reception  Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"Snowden's book likely won't change the minds of his detractors, but he makes a strong case for his efforts.\\" Greg Myre of NPR wrote, \\"Snowden has no new bombshells in his book. But he offers a very readable memoir about growing up with the Internet, a detailed rationale for his actions, and a look at how government surveillance has evolved since his disclosures.\\" Jill Lepore of The New Yorker wrote, \\"Some people write memoirs; other people craft legends. Snowden, who once aspired to be a model and is in some quarters regarded as a modern messiah, is the second kind.\\" Greg Miller of The Washington Post praised Snowden's \\"lucid and compelling language\\" concerning the architecture of the surveillance networks he exposed but felt the memoir was lessened by withholding \\"any truly revealing material about his own life\\" and lamented its lack of details on Snowden's experience in Russia and any regrets he may have. The Economist called the book \\"well-written, frequently funny\\" but concluded, \\"Whatever his relationship with the Russian authorities, and whenever it began, everything he says in Permanent Record‚Äîabout himself, and about America‚Äîmust be seen through the prism of his dependence on the Kremlin.\\" Publishers Weekly felt the book lacked a strong case for the argument that NSA surveillance \\"leads inevitably to oppressive control\\" but concluded, \\"Still, Snowden's many admirers will find his saga both captivating and inspiring.\\" On the day it was released, Permanent Record reached number one on Amazon's bestseller list.

As a missionary theologian, he created a German mission theology. On 5 October 2018, the Society of Peter Beyerhaus was founded in his name in South Korea. Biography Peter Paul Johannes Beyerhaus was born in Hohenkr√§nig, Brandenburg near K√∂nigsberg, New March. the eldest son of Siegfried Beyerhaus, Lutheran pastor in the east of the Oder river. After graduating from high school, he began to study theology in Berlin, Halle, Heidelberg, Bonn, Uppsala and Bethel. In Uppsala, he met his wife, Ingeg√§rd. He also met Bengt Sundkler there, who was to become his doctoral adviser. He learned from them the history of salvation and redemption of the Bible. His teacher influenced the formation of his missionary theology. Beyerhaus was ordained as a pastor by the bishop of Berlin on 15 January 1955, and was married on 6 August 1955 in the home town of his fianc√©e. The following year, he went to Oxford to study English. After returning to Sweden in the summer of 1956, he served several local churches in Norrk√∂ping. The couple's first daughter, Karolina, was born there. He completed his doctorate at Uppsala University in 1958. The title of the doctoral thesis was Die Selbst√§ndigkeit der jungen Kirchen als missionarisches Problem (The independence of young churches as a missiological problem). He served the Berlin Missionary Society in South Africa until 1965, finally as Rektor of the Lutheran Theological College in Uphumulo, Natal. He was professor of missionary theology and ecumenical theology at the University of T√ºbingen from 1966 to 1997, serving as dean of the theological faculty in 1974/75. He still taught as a professor emeritus at institutions such as Gustav-Siewert-Akademie, Staatsunabh√§ngige Theologische Hochschule in Basel, the faculty of Protestant theology in Heverlee/Leuven in Belgium and the Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. He lectured around the world. In 1972 he became president of the Theologischer Konvent der Konferenz Bekennender Gemeinschaften which he had co-founded. He was president of the IKBG/ICN from 1978 to 2009. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois, in 1995.

Distribution Despite the name, Baltic mixed forests are not found in any of the Baltic countries. These countries are instead dominated by the Sarmatic mixed forests ecoregion, with the exception of southern Lithuania, which is within the northern reaches of the Central European mixed forests. Rather, Baltic mixed forests are found along the western and southern shores of the Baltic Sea, comprising northwestern Poland, northeastern Germany, eastern Denmark and the very southernmost tip of Sweden. More specifically, they are common in lowland areas on the eastern side of the Danish peninsula and submontane areas north of the Elbe and Oder Rivers. Flora The ecoregion's natural habitat type is lowland to submontane beech and mixed beech forests. For the beech, European beech (fagus sylvatica) is dominant. Other tree species that mix in, covers a broad array of mostly deciduous trees, but also conifer to a small extent. Oak, elm, ash, linden, maple, hazel, rowan and birch are common among the many deciduous trees mixed in with beech.

Similarly, the fauna of the region will also be adversely affected, due to the Baltic region's particularly sensitive nature to changes in salinity, which can have a cascading effect on food webs and interaction between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

Hurricane Wilma developed on October 15 in the Caribbean Sea. Four days later, it intensified into the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record as determined by barometric pressure. Wilma weakened as it moved slowly northwestward, eventually making landfall late on October 21 on the island of Cozumel. At the time, it was a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Early the next day, the hurricane made another landfall on the Mexican mainland near Puerto Morelos. Wilma exited the Yucat√°n Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico on October 23, and a day later it struck Florida. The large and powerful hurricane dropped torrential rainfall across the northeastern Yucat√°n Peninsula and on offshore islands. Over a 24-hour period, Wilma produced of rainfall, the greatest 24-hour accumulation ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. Parts of the Yucat√°n Peninsula experienced tropical storm-force winds for nearly 50 hours. The hurricane produced Mexico's strongest wind gust on record: an anemometer recorded a reading of 212 km/h (132 mph) before the instrument failed. Wind gusts were estimated as high as . The hurricane moved ashore with an estimated storm surge, accompanied by waves which reached the third stories of some buildings. Wilma severely eroded the beaches of eastern Quintana Roo and caused flooding in neighboring Yucat√°n. Wilma contributed to eight deaths in Mexico ‚Äì seven in Quintana Roo and one in Yucat√°n. Hurricane Wilma directly inflicted about $4.8 billion (MXN, US$442 million) worth of damage, mostly in Quintana Roo. It was the state's costliest natural disaster. Much of the damage was done to tourism sectors of Canc√∫n and other nearby resort areas. The hurricane's indirect costs were significantly higher due to its disruption of tourism revenue, estimated at $13.9 billion (US$1.3 billion). About 98% of the lodging and resorts in Quintana Roo were damaged, including 110 hotels damaged or destroyed in Canc√∫n. Nationwide, Wilma destroyed 9,463 houses and caused damage to 19,517 others. In Canc√∫n alone, the hurricane left 300,000 people homeless. Background and preparations Hurricane Wilma developed on October 15, 2005 in the Caribbean Sea, as ascertained by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Four days later, it strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with the lowest recorded barometric pressure of any Atlantic hurricane: reconnaissance aircraft recorded a minimum pressure of . Wilma weakened as it drifted northwestward through the Caribbean over the next two days. The hurricane was originally projected to transit the Yucat√°n Channel between Mexico and Cuba, but it maintained its northwest trajectory. Wilma made landfall late on October 21 on the island of Cozumel. The NHC estimated the landfall intensity at , with Category 4 maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). Early on October 22, Wilma made a second landfall on the Quintana Roo mainland near Puerto Morelos. It then drifted across the northeastern Yucat√°n Peninsula, emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 23\\\\. The hurricane later moved to the northeast, striking Florida on October 24\\\\. It accelerated northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean and became an extratropical cyclone on October 26. eye of Hurricane Wilma moving over Cozumelalt=Satellite image with Cozumel visible within the eye of Wilma On October 18, the Mexican government issued a hurricane watch for the eastern coastline of the Yucat√°n Peninsula from Punta Allen to Cabo Catoche, including offshore islands. As the hurricane grew closer, these watches were upgraded to warnings and expanded from Chetumal in southern Quintana Roo to San Felipe, Yucat√°n; a tropical storm warning extended westward to Celest√∫n. The warnings were discontinued on October 23 as the hurricane moved into the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico's national weather service ‚Äì Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional ‚Äì issued 88 notices or bulletins related to Hurricane Wilma. Officials declared a state of emergency in 23 municipalities across the Yucat√°n, and placed Quintana Roo and Yucat√°n under a red alert, the highest on its color-coded alert system. Neighboring Campeche was placed on orange alert; Tabasco and Veracruz were placed on green alert; and Chiapas was placed on blue alert, the lowest warning on the scale. Hurricane Wilma affected parts of northeast Mexico that had been struck by Hurricane Stan just two weeks earlier, as well as Hurricane Emily in July. Ahead of Wilma's landfall, workers trimmed trees near power lines and placed notices on roads. About 75,000 people in northeastern Mexico evacuated the path of the storm. Some 45,000 individuals, many of them tourists, rode out the storm in 200 emergency shelters. Among the facilities serving as shelters were schools, clinics, and in one Maya community, a cave. About 300 people had to be relocated when their shelter in Canc√∫n flooded. Thousands of tourists fled the region before officials closed the international airports in Canc√∫n and Cozumel. Canc√∫n police ordered all residents to stay home during the storm. Los Premios MTV Latinoam√©rica ‚Äì the MTV Video Music Awards Latinoam√©rica ‚Äì were canceled due to the hurricane. The event was originally scheduled to occur in Playa del Carmen on October 20. Schools closures in Quintana Roo, Yucat√°n, and Campeche lasted up to 15 days in some areas. Impact alt=Satellite image of Wilma with an expansive area of rainbands to its east and northeast Hurricane Wilma produced torrential rainfall while moving slowly near the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Over a 24-hour period beginning at 12:30 UTC on October 21, a rain gauge on the offshore Isla Mujeres recorded of precipitation. This broke the record for Mexico's highest 24-hour rainfall total, as well as the highest 24 hour rainfall total in the Western Hemisphere. This was greater than the annual rainfall of Quintana Roo. Of that total, fell in a span of 12 hours. This was just short of the global record for 12-hour tropical cyclone rainfall set by Cyclone Denise in 1966. Other notable rainfall totals include in Canc√∫n, and in Loch√©, Yucat√°n. Wilma lashed parts of the Yucat√°n Peninsula with tropical storm-force winds for nearly 50 hours. A station in Canc√∫n recorded 10-minute sustained winds of 160 km/h (100 mph), with gusts to 212 km/h (132 mph) before the anemometer failed; gusts were estimated at . The gust in Canc√∫n was the strongest ever recorded in Mexico. Wilma was attended by a significant storm surge, estimated as high as by the NHC, which resulted in extensive beach erosion. The hurricane also damaged coral reefs offshore. In Canc√∫n, the wave action washed away about 700,000 m3 (247 million ft3) of sand from beaches. The seawater intrusion upset the microbial composition of the Nichupt√© Boj√≥rquez lagoon system near Canc√∫n, and more broadly injured vegetation near the coast. High waves from the hurricane trapped or immobilized about 3,800 boats in Mexico, with another 96 being damaged. The hurricane also damaged of crops, largely in Yucat√°n. Affected agricultural industries included corn, papayas, tomatoes, chili peppers, and livestock; fences, wind vanes, and other equipment were all damaged. The storm killed about 10% of the region's bees, affecting 83,000 colonies. The storm damaged of grasslands, threatening the food supply of about 100,000 cows. Across the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the hurricane destroyed a cumulative of forest. Across Mexico, Wilma killed eight people ‚Äì seven in Quintana Roo, and one in Yucat√°n. In Playa del Carmen, two people died and another seven were injured when a gas tank exploded. One person died in Yucat√°n after being struck by a fallen tree branch. Three people died on Cozumel. One person in Canc√∫n was electrocuted while preparing for the storm. Another person died in Canc√∫n because of glass from a broken window. Throughout Mexico, Wilma's damage was estimated at $4.8 billion (MXN, US$442 million). The hurricane caused an additional $13.9 billion (US$1.3 billion) in lost economic output and earnings, 95% of which was related to lost tourism revenue. Wilma damaged 28,980 houses along its path. Concrete buildings fared better than those constructed out of local materials. The storm damaged about 10,000 power lines, causing power outages for 300,000 people. Damage to transmission towers and antennas disrupted communications networks. The cost to repair the electrical infrastructure was $397.5 million (MXN, US$36.6 million), mostly in Quintana Roo. Across the region, Wilma damaged 473 schools, including about 60% of such institutions in Quintana Roo. Damage to schools accounted for $156 million (MXN, US$14.4 million) of the hurricane's cost. Hospitals, particularly in Canc√∫n and Cozumel, sustained damage to medical equipment. High winds blew down traffic signals, signs, and fences. Damage was heaviest in Quintana Roo, amounting to an estimated $4.506 billion (MXN, US$415 million); this made it the state's costliest hurricane. Across the state, Wilma destroyed 4,571 houses and damaged another 18,179 to some degree. Wilma also damaged 98% of the hotels in Quintana Roo, which includes the resort towns of Cozumel, Canc√∫n, and Playa del Carmen. The hurricane caused significant damage in Cozumel and Isla Mujeres, both located off the east coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The Cozumel boardwalk was wrecked. Wilma left parts of the Quintana Roo mainland without power, water, and gas. The storm damaged businesses, gas stations, and warehouses. High waves damaged the foundation of a hotel in Puerto Morelos, causing its partial collapse; it was later demolished. The hurricane caused significant flooding damage throughout the municipalities of Benito Ju√°rez and Solidaridad, which include Canc√∫n and Playa del Carmen. Floodwaters on Cozumel reached deep in spots. alt=Photograph of a damaged building and storm debris In Canc√∫n, about 300,000 people were left homeless, while another 700,000 people sustained damage to their homes. The water level in Canc√∫n reached the third storeys of some buildings due to waves atop the storm surge. About half of the buildings at Canc√∫n International Airport were severely damaged. The runway accumulated debris but was otherwise undamaged. Most significant to the city's economy, Wilma destroyed or severely damaged 110 hotels, mostly along Kukulk√°n Boulevard, which connects the line of hotels along the Nichupte Lagoon. The hotel damage was mostly material losses and generally not to the building's structure. Strong winds broke glass, tore off roof tiles, and wrecked water tanks. The storm surge washed away the foundations of two hotels, forcing them to be demolished. The high waves damaged hotel lobbies near the shore at El Miguelito. The sand at Playa Ballenas was entirely washed away, leaving behind the rocky base. Playa Delfines suffered similar effects. Two ferry terminals in Canc√∫n were damaged. Storm damage was estimated at $295.3 million (MXN, US$27.2 million) in Yucat√°n. There, the hurricane damaged 6,230 houses, with 4,892 of those being completely destroyed. Major causes of building failure were severe flooding and flimsy construction materials. Flooding was worst in the low-lying terrain of eastern Yucat√°n. The primary highway connecting Canc√∫n and M√©rida, Yucat√°n was impassible, and workers began restoration work immediately after the storm passed. Public access to the archaeological site Chichen Itza was closed while cleanup work got underway. Roof damage to schools in San Felipe and Tizim√≠n resulted in the destruction of furniture and electrical systems inside. Flooding undermined roads and cut water service in Tizim√≠n. Raging floodwaters battered bridges to Telchac Puerto, Chabihau, and Santa Rosa. High winds heavily damaged the El Cuyo port lighthouse. Aftermath Storm damage to a alt=Photograph of a fast food restaurant showing some damage to its fa√ßade with debris on the adjacent road Storm shelters and affected communities both faced shortages in the immediate aftermath of Wilma. In Canc√∫n, officials distributed food and water from city hall. There were 10 community kitchens across the city, each capable of feeding 1,500 people per day. Local and federal troops quelled looting and rioting in Canc√∫n. Traffic on Cancun's Kukulk√°n Boulevard reopened on October 25 after the roadway was flooded for three days. The Mexican Army partially reopened Canc√∫n International Airport on October 24 to facilitate the movement of aid and equipment; it reopened to the public three days later. While Canc√∫n's airport was closed to the public, stranded visitors filled taxis and buses to M√©rida, Yucat√°n. Located 320 km (200 mi) from Canc√∫n, M√©rida was home to the closest operational airport. Hotels and outgoing flights were filled to capacity in M√©rida for several days after the storm. On October 27, President of Mexico Vicente Fox surveyed the storm damage. Fox's Secretary of Tourism, Rodolfo Elizondo Torres, orchestrated the response with a goal of quick revival tourist areas. President Fox pledged that 75% of the hotels would be repaired by December 15, promising loans and tax breaks to restore the industry. Most hotels in Cozumel, Isla Mujeres, and the Riviera Maya were reopened by early January 2006. The resorts in Canc√∫n took longer to restore, but most were open for business by one year after the storm. On November 28, the Official Journal of the Federation announced a disaster area for 9 of Quintana Roo's 11 municipalities ‚Äì Benito Ju√°rez, Cozumel, Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Isla Mujeres, L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Othon P. Blanco, and Solidaridad. Following the destructive impacts of Wilma and earlier Hurricane Stan, Mexico's state-owned bank, Banobras, authorized $21 billion (MXN, US$2 billion) to states and local municipalities for rebuilding. Mexico's development bank ‚Äì Nacional Financiera ‚Äì provided financial assistance for businesses affected by Wilma and Stan through a $400 million fund (MXN, US$37 million). Quintana Roo's state government began a temporary work program for residents whose jobs were impacted by the hurricane. Other Mexican state governments sent helicopters, machinery, food, and aid to the hardest hit areas. Healthcare workers provided vaccines and focused on preventing vector- borne diseases. About 3,500 people worked to restore water and power service, although total restoration of electricity was expected to take about a month. Mexico's Comisi√≥n Nacional de Libros de Texto Gratuitos sent 250,000 textbooks to Quintana Roo for the thousands of students who lost their academic supplies. To replenish beaches, crews installed geotubes and dredged about 2.5 million m3 (660 ft3) of sand, supported by Mexico's federal government and the Instituto Mexicano de Tecnolog√≠a del Agua. The new beaches were not as smooth or fair in color as the previous ones, which had formed naturally over time. The Mexican Red Cross provided health care and food to emergency shelters. The agency sent 54 tons of food and water supplies to the Yucat√°n Peninsula, along with teams of experts to coordinate the disaster response. It also distributed 3,650 emergency kits to affected residents in Quintana Roo; the kits included plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, kitchen sets, and hygiene supplies. A Salvation Army plane dropped off 10 tons of bottled water to Canc√∫n and took stranded tourists on its return flight. The United States Agency for International Development sent $9.8 million (US$900,000) to the Mexican Red Cross following hurricanes Stan and Wilma. The name Wilma was later retired, meaning it will not be used again for another Atlantic hurricane.

Standifer Construction Company of Vancouver for the United States Shipping Board as part of the wartime shipbuilding program of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) to restore the nation's Merchant Marine. The vessel was largely employed on the East Coast of the United States to Australia route until 1928 when she was laid up. In late 1937 the ship together with several other vessels was bid on and subsequently acquired next year by the Greek tramp operator John D. Chandris to carry cargo from Australia to Greece and United Kingdom. The freighter was also renamed Adelfoi Chandris. Following the surrender of France, the ship was interned in Dakar and passed into Vichy government hands in 1940 and renamed Saint Marin. Under the terms of Nevers Agreement she eventually was transferred to Italy and renamed Catania. In early August 1943 the vessel together with several other ships was bombed and damaged in Naples harbor by the Allied aircraft. Design and construction After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons deadweight designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB. Cokesit was part of the order for 10 vessels placed by USSB with Guy M. Standifer Construction Co. on 8 January 1918 and was laid down on 3 August 1918 and launched on 31 December 1918 (yard number 1), with Miss Ruth Standifer, sister of Guy M. Standifer, principal owner of the G. M. Standifer Construction Co., being the sponsor. Due to the ship being the first vessel launched by a newly established yard, there was a large crowd in attendance consisting of common folk and local dignitaries. Just as with many other vessels being built for the Shipping Board, her name was picked by Mrs. Woodrow Wilson who often chose Native American words for naming purposes. The ship had two main decks as well as forecastle and poop deck and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The freighter had five main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five large hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. She was also equipped with wireless apparatus, had submarine signal system installed and had electrical lights installed along the decks. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Cokesit was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,627. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single 2,800 ihp triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel. The sea trials were held on the Columbia River on 16 April 1919 during which the ship could easily maintain an average speed of on several runs over a measured distance, half a knot above her contract speed. Following their successful completion, the ship was turned over to the USSB two weeks later. Operational history While the steamer was still under construction she was allocated by the USSB to Pacific Steamship Company to transport flour to the East Coast for delivery to Europe. Following an established USSB policy the Shipping Board ship could only continue with cargo to Europe if an equivalent amount of cargo space would be allocated by a foreign shipping operator. After finishing her test trial, the freighter was put back into shipbuilder's yard for minor repairs and painting. She then moved to an elevator where she took on board 7,525 tons of flour and cleared from loading area on May 16. Cokesit then proceeded on a twelve-hour long loaded trail run arriving at Astoria next day at around noon. The vessel finally sailed out on May 19 and arrived at Hampton Roads via the Panama Canal on June 17 where she unloaded her entire cargo of flour. Soon after she was reallocated to Barber Line and proceeded to Savannah where she loaded 6,085 bales of cotton in addition to other cargo and departed for Liverpool and Glasgow on August 22. Cokesit returned to Newport News from her European trip on November 14 and from there proceeded to Tampa on December 15 to load a full cargo of phosphate rock for delivery to Denmark. The freighter made one more voyage for Barber Line in May 1920 carrying a mixed cargo of cotton and phosphates to Le Havre and Ghent and returning to Newport News on July 8. She then remained berthed at Hampton Roads until being chartered for one trip to France and departing with 6,611 tons of coal for Dunkirk on 29 October 1920. She returned to Savannah from her trip in mid-December of the same year and remained idle there for an entire 1921. In December 1921 Cokesit was allocated to Lykes Brothers to serve on their trade route from Galveston to French and German ports and departed Savannah on 6 January 1922 bound for New Orleans. She sailed from there on January 26 for Rotterdam carrying a cargo of grain and lumber. She made one more trip in April 1922 to Bremen with a cargo of 85,731 bushels of rye before being withdrawn from Gulf service in May 1922 due to her being a coal-burning vessel and her inability to hold enough coal to make a round trip voyage to Europe. Upon her return from Europe in June 1922 Cokesit was assigned to the United States & Australia Line to operate between New York and Australian, New Zealand and other Oriental ports. The freighter departed New York on her first trip on the new route on 29 July 1922 carrying full cargo of case oil. She called at Port Natal on September 3 to refill her bunkers, and arrived at Fremantle on September 28. The freighter then visited several ports in Australia unloading her cargo and sailed from Newcastle in ballast on November 6 bound for the Philippines and China. After loading approximately 6,500 tons of general cargo largely consisting of sugar at Cebu, Pulupandan, Manila and Shanghai the freighter arrived at Boston via Comox and Panama Canal on 4 March 1923 and from there proceeded to New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore to unload the freight. Subsequently, she proceeded to James River on July 23 where she was laid up. Cokesit was reactivated at the end of 1924 and arrived at New York for loading on 8 December 1924. She was again allocated to the United States & Australia Line and sailed from New York on December 23 bound for Australia. The freighter continue serving the same route through September 1926. Following a return from one of this trips, Cokesit was allocated to Roosevelt Line to serve on the newly inaugurated route from East Coast to Australia. The ship made only one trip in this capacity leaving New York in November 1926 and returning to Boston on 1 April 1927 with a large cargo of wool, hides and cocoa. She was scheduled to depart for another trip on July 20 of the same year but that trip never happened and the ship remained idle waiting for another opportunity. Cokesit was eventually laid up and relocated to a ship anchorage off Staten Island. After being laid up for approximately nine years Cokesit was designated for sale and disposal in 1936. However, in October 1937 the U.S. Maritime Commission offered a large number of vessels in their reserve fleet for sale and Greek shipowner John D. Chandris stepped in and inquired about buying four large vessels off this list. These steamers, Arcturus, Cokesit, Oakspring and Rockport, were cleared by the Maritime Commission for sale to a foreign entity and were acquired by the Greek firm for 367,536 the same month. Cokesit was renamed Adelfoi Chandris and was immediately put on the company's trade routes in the Baltic and the Mediterranean. The vessel remained in this trade through the entire 1938. Early in 1939 the freighter was chartered for one trip to Australia and New Zealand and departed from Sfax with a cargo of Gafsa phosphates on 11 February 1939 bound for Auckland and New Plymouth. After unloading her cargo in New Zealand the ship continued on to Sydney where she took on board 8,602 tons of wheat and left on 3 June 1939 bound for United Kingdom and Greece. She arrived in England in early September 1939, and due to the start of World War II could no longer be used in the Baltic trade. The ship then proceeded to North America arriving in Vancouver in January 1940. While in British Columbia Adelfoi Chandris loaded approximately 8,000 tons of lead and lumber and departed New Westminster on 19 February 1940, passed through the Panama Canal on March 3 and arrived in Halifax in mid-March. While there, Adelfoi Chandris was made part of convoy HX-29 and sailed from Halifax on 21 March 1940 for Liverpool successfully reaching her destination on April 4. On 23 April 1940 while still at Garston the ship was seized by the French government and put under control of Chargeurs Reunis. The freighter then proceeded to Barry in ballast as part of convoy OB 136 arriving there on April 28. Following the surrender of France the vessel left England and eventually ended up at Dakar on August 8 where she was interned and remained berthed. On 21 October 1941 the vessel was transferred to Soci√©t√© Nationale d'Affr√™tements (SNA) and renamed Saint Marin. She continued her stay at Dakar undergoing repairs from October 1941 through February 1942 before sailing for Marseilles where she underwent further repairs from 5 March through 15 April 1942. Under the terms of Nevers Agreement signed between the Nazi Germany and the Vichy Government on 27/28 August 1942 all foreign merchant ships in French custody were to be transferred to Germany. On 23 October 1942 Saint Marin was restored to their former Greek owners under her original name and simultaneously transferred to Italy and put under control of Societ√† Anonima di Navigazione Italia under a name Catania. On 12 November 1942 the vessel was requisitioned by Regia Marina and remained in their service until 3 March 1943 when the ship charter was annulled. The vessel subsequently was chartered by Regio Esercito and remained under their control until the end of her career. On 4 August 1943 she was heavily damaged during an Allied air raid on Naples. She was further damaged during another air raid on 8 September 1943, and was finally scuttled by the retreating German troops on 15 September 1943 a few days before arrival of Allies in Naples. After the end of the World War II the ship was raised and Italy was allowed to scrap the wreckage in 1949.

The machine are in the streetfighter style and powered by 800 cc three-cylinder engines. Originally introduced in 2014 as the Brutale Dragster 800, part of the Brutale series, the Dragster range was expanded and spun off into its own series. Overview First shown at the 2013 Milan EICMA Show, the Dragster was conceived at a more aggressive version of the naked Brutale. Initial sales were good, the model selling three times more than the predicted sales for 2014. The models were updated for 2018. Engines were updated to meet the Euro4 European emission standards. The cycle parts were also modified, giving a 20 mm longer wheelbase and 8.5 mm greater trail. The engine mounting points were revised to give more torsional rigidity. =Technical details= The 799 cc engine, originally designed by Ezio Mascheroni and first fitted to the F3, uses a DOHC inline three-cylinder layout with four valves per cylinder. A counter-rotating (reverse) crankshaft is used, which counteracts the centripetal forces of the wheels allowing the bike to turn faster. The bore and stroke are 79 mm and 54.3 mm. The engine hangs from a tubular frame and is a stressed member. The machine has 43 mm upside-down Marzocchi forks, a Sachs rear shock absorber, a Brembo four-piston (front) and two-piston (rear) brake system. The wheels and swinging arm are made of aluminium. Other aluminium parts are the frame plates and the fork bridges. The machine has a full electronics suite, including traction control, ABS and four riding modes Model Variants =Dragster 800= Introduced in 2014 as the Brutale Dragster 800, the machine was based on the Brutale 800. The rear bodywork was revised to accommodate a larger 200/50ZR17 tyre. =Dragster 800 RR= The Dragster 800 RR, introduced in 2015, is a more powerful version of the Dragster 800. Intake and exhaust modifications increased power output by 15 bhp to produce 140 (104 kW) bhp @ 13,100rpm. A quickshifter was fitted to the gearbox, allowing clutchless changes both up and down. The suspension was made stiffer and wire-spoked wheels fitted. =Dragster 800 RR SCS= The Dragster 800 RR was further enhanced for 2020 with the addition of the SCS 2.0 Smart Clutch System and designated the Dragster 800 RR SCS. The SCS 2.0 system, which was first fitted on the Turismo Veloce in 2018, allows the rider to use the clutch in a conventional manner with the lever, or simply allow the system to control the clutch. The system is based on the Rekluse clutch, which allows the rider to engage gear at tickover without using the clutch. Once the throttle is opened the clutch engages. The MV system adds electronic control, which optimises clutch engagement based on engine revs and throttle position, during up and down- shifts. The SCS system weighs just 36g more than a conventional clutch. =Dragster 800 RC= 2017 MV Agusta Dragster 800 RC Part of the Reparto Corse line-up, the Dragster 800 RC is a limited edition model produced in 2017. Extensive use of carbon fibre bodywork and forged wheels contribute to reducing the dry weight to 168 kg. The machine used the same 140 bhp engine as the 800 RR. The machine was finished in a red, white and black livery with Reparto Corse graphics, including the number 37, which is the number of world championships MV Agusta have won. Production was limited to 350 units. =Dragster 800 RR LH44= In 2018 the limited-edition Dragster 800 RR LH44 was produced. The machine was designed in collaboration with Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton. Based on the Dragster 800 RR, the LH44 used carbon fibre components and finished in a distinctive red, white and black livery with Lewis Hamilton graphics, including the number 44 which is the number Hamilton races under in F1. Production was limited to 144 units. =Dragster 800 RR Pirelli= First presented in September 2018 at the opening of the P ZERO World of Monte Carlo, the limited-edition Dragster 800 RR Pirelli is a collaboration between MV Agusta and tyre manufacturer Pirelli. Based on the Dragster 800 RR, the tank slider and the fairing are manufactured in a rubber formulated by the Pirelli Research and Development department to resist scratches, scuffs and abrasions. The machine is available in Pirelli yellow/black or ice pearl white/America blue livery with Pirelli graphics. Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa SP tyres are fitted and have yellow or blue stripes on the sidewalls to match the livery. =Dragster 800 RR America= The 2019 Dragster 800 RR America is based on the 800 RR with a red, white and blue finish that plays tribute to the 1975 MV Agusta 750 Sport America and the American flag. The America blue/white/Ago red/deep black livery is complemented by the spoked wheels, which have red hubs, blue spoke retainers, and white rims. Production is limited to 200 units. =Dragster 800 Rosso= Introduced at the 2019 EICMA Milan Show, the Turismo Veloce 800 Rosso is part of MV's entry-level Rosso collection. Changes are minimal, such as the wheels being plain cast alloy rather than the milled finish of other models. The machine is finish is a distinctive red and black livery.

Byrd has released three solo albums (Tough Room...This World, Lifer, Clean Getaway), the latter containing lyrics that focus on addiction, recovery, and hope, drawing on his own past struggles with drugs and alcohol. In recovery for over thirty years, Byrd performs at benefit shows to raise awareness and money for drug and alcohol treatment facilities, and is a certified recovery coach and drug and alcohol counselor. He coined the phrase, \\"Recovery Troubadour\\", as he leads recovery music groups at treatment facilities around the United States. Early life Byrd grew up in the Bronx borough of New York City, and as a teenager listened to British rock, Memphis soul and Blues. He began playing guitar after seeing the Rolling Stones and The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. Early performances were in cover bands at local dances, schools and parties and at 16, while still using his name Ricky Bird, he joined a band called Ruff Stuff. The group performed at Max's Kansas City and Mercer Arts Center in New York City, and other locations before he started going by a new professional name‚ÄîRicky Byrd. Musical career At 21 in 1977, Byrd joined the Power pop band called Susan,. The group released one album, Falling in Love Again! in 1979 on RCA Records, and toured opening for Graham Parker and others. In 1981, rocker Joan Jett was looking for a guitarist to replace Eric Ambel in her band the Blackhearts. After jamming with her band, Byrd joined the Blackhearts and played guitar and sang background vocals on the album in progress, I Love Rock n' Roll. The album sold one million copies in the U.S., went to number 2 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, and sold over ten million copies worldwide. The single, \\"I Love Rock n' Roll\\" remained as Billboard Hot 100 number one for seven weeks. Joan Jett and the Blackhearts toured the world starting in clubs and then ultimately played stadiums. Byrd was a Blackheart with Joan Jett from 1981 to 1991, recording guitar, vocals and co-writing various songs for the followup platinum-selling Album in 1983, Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth in 1984, Good Music in 1986, the platinum- certified Up Your Alley in 1988, The Hit List and Notorious in 1991. During this time, Byrd struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, got clean and sober in 1987, and remained with Joan Jett and the Blackhearts for another four years playing and touring. When he left the Blackhearts, Byrd signed a deal with Sony Music Publishing. During this time, he recorded and toured with Roger Daltrey and toured with Ian Hunter. In 1999, Byrd released his debut solo album, Tough Room...This World, a \\"blues-inflected acoustic-rock set\\" recorded live from a show in New York. Joining him onstage and on record were Todd Rundgren bassist Kasim Sulton and Bad Company drummer Simon Kirke. Byrd released the record on his own label, Kayos Records. Now sober from drugs and alcohol, Byrd began performing at recovery-related fundraisers at treatment centers after the Del Fuegos' Woody Geissmann invited him to play at Right Turn, a Boston treatment facility he founded. \\"I continued to be a part of these benefits for the next few years, and in 2012 I co-wrote my first recovery song called 'Broken is a Place' with my pal Richie Supa,\\" Byrd told Parade magazine. Byrd performed \\"Broken is a Place\\" live at these recovery- type of shows. Byrd's second album, Lifer was recorded in Nashville and New York City, executive produced by Ray Kennedy (five-time Grammy winner who worked with Steve Earle, Ray Davies, Sheryl Crow) and co-produced by Byrd and Bob Stander. The album, released in 2012, was the number 10 Coolest Album in the World 2013 and ‚ÄúThings to Learn‚Äù from the album was Coolest Song in the World the first week of January 2014 on Little Steven‚Äôs Underground Garage radio show. ‚ÄúFrom the time I left Joan Jett and the Blackhearts around 1991, I was really trying to see what I sounded like on my own,‚Äù Byrd told Guitar Player. ‚ÄúI knew who my influences were‚ÄîI grew up on everything from the Raspberries to the Who to the Stones to the Yardbirds to Otis Redding. If you just mix that all in a stew, I guess it comes out Ricky Byrd.\\" In April 2015, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts were inducted into the 30th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Cleveland, Ohio. As a Blackheart, Byrd received the honor as well as the other band members. When Byrd was 30 years clean and sober, in October 2015, he released his third solo album, Clean Getaway, 12 songs focusing on the struggles of drug addiction and the positive side of recovery that he wrote or co-wrote with Richie Supa and Mark Hudson. The album of original songs also includes a cover of Paul Revere and the Raiders' 1966 hit \\"Kicks.\\" Byrd told ABC News Radio that Clean Getaway is \\"kind of like a self-help book with a backbeat.\\" Clean Getaway was produced by Byrd and Bob Stander, and featured players including keyboardist Bobby Whitlock (Derek and The Dominos); drummer Steve Holley (Wings); bassist Stander; keyboardist Andy Burton (Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul); keyboardist Jeff Kazee (Southside Johnny); horn players John Isley and Chris Anderson of the Asbury Jukes (horns); vocalists Christine Ohlman (Saturday Night Live band), Marge Raymond, Mark Hudson, and Sara Devine. \\"My job is to show people you can be sober and still have fun. I tell them, 'Look, I did it, brother,'\\" Byrd said. Recovery work In 2014, as part of a group of musicians in recovery or support the recovery lifestyle, Byrd performed at a Fed Up! rally in Washington, D.C. Two years later, he participated in the Rock and Roll for Children Foundation Annual concert at the Bethesda Blues and Jazz Club, a show that raised $50,000 for The Children‚Äôs Inn at the National Institute of Health. Byrd became a certified recovery coach and a drug and alcohol counselor in 2018, and leads recovery music groups at drug treatment facilities. That year, Byrd joined Michael Des Barres, Liberty DeVitto and Paul Ill at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland for a talk and performance of songs about addiction and recovery. The event benefited Recovery Resources, a Cleveland non-profit behavior healthcare organization. \\"I‚Äôve been in recovery since September 25, 1987. Given that gift, I have a responsibility to pass it on. The way I see it, there is a dark hallway filled with people in active addiction, stuck and struggling between denial and surrender. I‚Äôm here to be a power of example. To show that we CAN and DO recover. When someone is ready to reach out for help, I wanna be there at the end of that dark hallway waving him or her towards the light,\\" explained Byrd. In June 2019, New York State Senator Joseph P. Addabbo, Jr., 2019-2020 President of the Conference of Italian-American State Legislators, honored Byrd as someone who follows the mission \\"to foster and celebrate Italian- American contributions to all aspects of society to the State of New York and beyond.\\" Fellow honorees included former Major League Baseball World Series catcher and manager Joe Girardi, and AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento. ‚ÄúIt was my distinct honor to acknowledge these three outstanding individuals for their impact and inspiration to the lives of others as a result of their actions and accomplishments,‚Äù Addabbo said. ‚ÄúRicky Byrd, for instance, has used his music, notoriety and personal struggle to help countless others who grapple with addiction. I am extremely proud to call Ricky Byrd a friend, constituent, neighbor and fellow Italian-American.‚Äù At the Fourth Annual Gala of the Rockit Live Foundation in August 2019, Byrd was honored for his work with young artists, in music education, and recovery. He performed live for the event that benefit the Rockit Live Foundation Scholarship Fund. All proceeds from this event will benefit the Rockit Live Foundation Scholarship Fund. Also in August, Byrd joined Kathy Valentine (the Go-Go‚Äôs), Liberty Devitto (Billy Joel) and Genya Ravan (Goldie and the Gingerbreads, SiriusXM DJ), at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland to discuss songwriting and perform songs about addiction and recovery. The event, called Rock & Resilience Community Day, was presented by Rock & Recovery (91.3 The Summit) and had booths with information from various recovery and treatment facilities.

She is a reader (associate professor) at University College London and is an expert in social wasps.  Education and career  Sumner was educated at University College London where she was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Zoology and in 1999 was awarded a PhD on Conflicts over reproduction in facultatively eusocial hover wasps'. Her postdoctoral work was with Jacobus Boomsma at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and she then held fellowships at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and at the Institute of Zoology, London. Sumner moved to the University of Bristol as a Senior Lecturer in 2012 and then moved to University College London as a Reader in Behavioural Ecology in 2016, her current position.  Research  Her research looks at the evolution of insect social behaviour and she has studied insect species along a continuum of sociality. She showed that insects can have simple sociality based on behaviour rather than physical characteristic of a caste, and that in these simple societies individuals can change caste from worker to queen, which is not possible in complex insect societies such as honeybees. Sumner made the first use of RFID tags in field research, finding that the movement of paper wasp queens away from their home nests was much higher than expected On more complex insect societies Sumner did some of the first research on the genetic relatedness of bumblebee colonies, showing that sister queens emerging from the same colony travel far apart from each other to establish their new colonies. Sumner has also looked at the effect of social insect populations on their environments such as the impact of Argentine ants on seed dispersal. She has also worked on ants, looking at a parasitic ant species which evolved from and parasitises on a leaf-cutter species in Panama, she found that queens of the parasite species only mate with a single male, compared to the host leaf-cutter queens which mate with multiple males. Sumner is an advocate of the ecosystem services of social wasps saying that \\"wasps are useful and they are essential\\" and that social wasps can be predators that can help control populations of pest insects. Sumner's lab are researching how social wasps might communicate within their colony about where resources are, perhaps like honey bees do the waggle dance. In 2019 she published a Proceedings of the Royal Society B article on showing how social paper wasps can be successful predators of two economically important pests the sugarcane borer and the fall armyworm. Her research on public attitudes to bees and wasps showed that the benefits of bees are widely understood but those of wasps are not, which is also reflected in the amount of scientific research into the two groups, with wasps being underresearched compared to bees. Sumner cofounded the citizen science initiative The Big Wasp Survey in 2017 with Professor Adam Hart to raise awareness of the role and diversity of social wasp species in the UK and to compare the accuracy of citizen science data with long-term biological recording data.  Public activities  With Dr Nathalie Pettorelli of the Zoological Society of London, Sumner cofounded Soapbox Science in 2011, a platform that promotes women working in science. Sumner has taken part in Pint of Science events in 2015, 2018, and 2019 and has talked at the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2016. In 2019 it was announced that Sumner would write a popular science book titled Endless Forms on wasps to be published by William Collins. With the FoAM Kernow lab in Falmouth, Sumner helped create an online game #wasplove for people to create their own wasp societies. Sumner will be an invited speaker at the EntoSci event in 2020 talking about her career to 14 to 18 year olds.

It was issued its first license, as KZC, in December 1921, changed its call letters to KOG a few weeks later, and was deleted less than a year and one half after its start. History August 1922 Western Radio Electric Company advertisement.Western Radio Electric Company (advertisement), Radio Doings, August 19, 1922, back cover. KOG was first licensed as a broadcasting station in December 1921. However the station's owner, the Western Radio Electric Company of Los Angeles, California, already had extensive experience making broadcasts intended for the general public under an earlier Experimental license. Beginning in late 1912, radio communication in the United States was regulated by the Department of Commerce. Initially there were no formal standards for which stations could make broadcasts intended for the general public, and after World War I stations under a variety of license classes, most commonly Amateur and Experimental, began making regularly scheduled programs on a limited basis. In 1919 Les E. Taufenback (as president) and Harold Nunan founded the Western Radio Electric Company, then at 637 South Hope in Los Angeles.\\"LA History section: KZC / KOG - Los Angeles\\" by Jim Hilliker, circa 2003 (oldradio.com) In early 1920, the company received a license for an Experimental station with the call sign 6XD.\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1920, page 5. The \\"6\\" in 6XD's call sign indicated that the station was located in the sixth Radio Inspection district, while the \\"X\\" signified that it was operating under an Experimental license. 6XD was credited with being the first station in the Los Angeles region to conduct experimental entertainment broadcasts, which began around mid-1920.\\"Development of Radio Telephone and C.W. in Southern California\\", Radio, November 1921, page 149. By the fall of 1921 the station was at 550 South Flower Street and featured \\"the latest Victor Records as soon as they are ready for distribution\\" as provided by Richardson's Music Shop.\\"The 'Wesrad' Radio Telephone Station\\", Pacific Radio News, September 1921, page 48.

KZC/KOG In order to provide common standards for the broadcasting activity starting to appear nationwide, the Commerce Department adopted a regulation effective December 1, 1921 requiring broadcasting stations to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on two designated broadcasting wavelengths: 360 meters (833 kHz) for \\"entertainment\\", and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \\"market and weather reports\\".\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10.

Kluge's KQL, issued for Los Angeles under the new regulations. In mid-December 1921 it was announced that Western Radio Electric, now at 550 South Flower Street, was installing \\"a powerful 50-watt continuous wave transmitter\\" at the Kinema Theater at Seventh and Grand Streets, and \\"the orchestra selections, organ solos and songs from the stage will be broadcasted through space\\".\\"Kinema Installs Radio Telephone To Transmit Music\\", Los Angeles Herald, December 17, 1921, page B-2.

Advertisements for KOG variously identified the station as the \\"Kinema Theater Radiophone\\"Western Radio Electric Company (advertisement), QST, April 1922, page 114. and the \\"Herald Broadcasting Station\\". Initially the 360 meter wavelength was the only \\"entertainment\\" frequency available, so stations within various regions had to development timesharing agreements to assign individual operating slots. In mid-May 1922, KOG, in conjunction with the Kinema, was assigned 12:00-12:15 p.m. and 5:00-5:30 p.m. weekdays, plus 8:00-9:00 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday evenings.\\"Broadcasting Times Changed\\" by John S.

One day, Dil√© and √ìbena went out to look for firewood, because they had run out. They met Its√∂, who did them the favor of cutting and loading them with firewood. In gratitude, they let Its√∂ rest for a while in their house and chat with them. He claimed to be an awapa (shaman), so he checks Agata to remove the lice from her hair. However, this was only an excuse to suck √Ågata's blood and flesh, leaving only the skeleton where Serike's fetus was restless, moving from side to side. When Dil√© and √ìbena saw what had happened, they hid, immobile and nervous, climbing a tree while Its√∂ tried to climb to eat them, sucking the wind to pull them. Afterwards, exhausted and without achieving his goal, he left for his home. One day later Tal√° Yakela returns home, and upon seeing what happened, he patiently collected fibers from tree bark and medicinal leaves. With these precious materials he managed to reconstitute all the parts of √Ågata's body, so she could give birth to S√©rike . The next day, Tal√° Yakela took his blowgun and fired at the immense sea, where Its√∂ slept, which was covered with black clouds. He decides to go to Tal√° Yakela's house, where he was surprised to see √Ågata alive, and even more beautiful. There, they forced him to dig a hole in the ground and light a fire in which he was caught in the middle of the hot stones and roasted to death. Tal√° Yakela emptied mud, water and clay into the campfire and steam sprouted, from one eye of Its√∂, a beautiful butterfly with owl eyes that fluttered with its wings, and from the other eye a beautiful owl flew out, calling j√∂√∂√º√º , j√∂√∂√º√º, singing in fright. The moral of the story is that the good and the bad are preserved within each person or animal. = Story of the Sun Lord and the Hurricane Children = Every day the Sun Lord goes to bed very tired, for his great work. As soon as the Sun Lord begins to appear and show the first rays, the Hurricane Children begin to look for it to lift it, because it always costs a lot, turns and covers with the clouds up, but the Hurricane Children always find it, and the first to see it is always the youngest, Yaba Bat√°sku S√©rike. Together they grab and stretch the whiskers (which are those first rays of light in the morning), and so they finish lifting it, every day. = Hurricane Children and Sakabiali = Sib√∂ needed the help of a brave, strong, responsible person with authority to be a leader who made decisions and who was in charge of ruling on earth; So he chose Tal√° Yakela, father of the Hurricane Children. √Ågata, their mother, was in charge of the duties of the home and caring for the children. They listened to multiple stories of their uncle Ol√≥bas√°, who told in each of them the importance of staying together in the house of not going out at night, loving, caring and protecting the works of Sib√∂. Due to their great curiosity, the Hurricane Children escape from their home to know the world; This is why his mother searches for them for a long time without any success and decides to continue with his work. On their trip around the world, the children meet the Sun Lord, who is their uncle and who as such advises them to stop playing so much and to return home to their mother's side; however, the children stay playing for a few more days and then make the decision to return. When the Hurricane Children return home they do not find their mother, but discover a handful of bones. At that time the children heard an echo that comes from the skeleton and was similar to the voice of their mother. √Ågata, through the echo, expresses to her children the sadness she felt for his abandonment and disobedience; but he also tells them how happy she feels to have them back at home and asks them as her last advice, to be good, obedient, kind and respectful children. The children asked their mother's skeleton about what happened, to which the voice answered meticulously that the person who killed her is Sakabiali, the lady of the mountain, who made her run behind a deer through all the paths, hillsides and mountains, up and down, barking like a dog all day until sunset, until in a well-squeezed passage she waited for her and hit her with a piece of stick and then sucked all her blood and ate all her flesh. After the children heard the story they left in search of Sakabiali. She was hidden in a huge lagoon in a place called Janeu, by the Telire river basin, in Talamanca. Upon arrival, the children found the Dululba snake, responsible for devouring all those who commit incest. They decided to play for a while, and afterwards, one of the children remembered that Sakabiali liked spicy chili peppers. They put a piece on a hook and managed to lure her out. The lady of the mountain confessed that she killed their mother because nobody took care of her, and she was very hungry; so the children convince her to show them how she killed her, tricking her and killing her in the same way she killed her mother. Once the children leave, they find their uncle again, Lord Sun and he rebukes them for their actions and advises them to learn to live together and practice good deeds; To obey the rules of the family and not destroy.

It is also known as the Israeli yellow scorpion, It was once considered as a subspecies of Leiurus quinquestriatus but recently it was elevated to the rank of a species.Lowe G, Yagmur EA, Kovarik F. A Review of the Genus Leiurus Ehrenberg, 1828 (Scorpiones: Buthidae) with Description of Four New Species from the Arabian Peninsula. Euscorpius. 2014 (191):1-129. PDF. It is currently known from Israel, but it may live in other countries in the Middle East. Other species of the genus Leiurus are also often referred to as \\"deathstalkers\\".  Description  Leiurus hebraeus is yellow, and long, with an average of .  Geographic range  Leiurus hebraeus can be found in desert and scrubland habitats in the Middle East. Its range covers Israel and its neighboring countries. Since it was declared as a species only recently, further research is needed to determine its range.  Venom  A deathstalker eating a cricket in captivity Neurotoxins in L. quinquestriatus venom include: * Chlorotoxin * Charybdotoxin * Scyllatoxin * Agitoxins types one, two and three =Hazards= The deathstalker is one of the most dangerous species of scorpions.\\"The World‚Äôs Most Dangerous Scorpions\\" Planet Deadly.\\"Not so scary scorpions\\" National Science Foundation. Its venom is a powerful mixture of neurotoxins, with a low lethal dose. While a sting from this scorpion is extraordinarily painful, it normally would not kill a healthy adult human. However, young children, the elderly, or infirm (such as those with a heart condition and those who are allergic) are at much greater risk. Any envenomation runs the risk of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction to the venom. A study from Israel shows a high rate of pancreatitis following envenomation. If a sting from Leiurus quinquestriatus does prove deadly, the cause of death is usually pulmonary edema. Antivenom for the treatment of deathstalker envenomations is produced by pharmaceutical companies Twyford (German) and Sanofi Pasteur (French), and by the Antivenom and Vaccine Production Center in Riyadh. Envenomation by the deathstalker is considered a medical emergency even with antivenom treatment, as its venom is unusually resistant to treatment and typically requires large doses of antivenom. In the United States and other countries outside of the typical range of the deathstalker, there is the additional complicating factor that none of the existing antivenoms are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (or equivalent agencies) and are only available as investigational drugs (INDs). The US Armed Forces maintain an investigational drug application for the AVPC-Riyadh antivenom in the event of envenomation of soldiers in the Gulf War theater of operations, and the Florida Antivenin Bank maintains an IND application for Sanofi Pasteur's Scorpifav antivenom. =Uses= Deathstalker in Negev Desert, Israel. A component of the deathstalker's venom, the peptide chlorotoxin, has shown potential for treating human brain tumors. There has also been some evidence to show that other components of the venom may aid in the regulation of insulin and could be used to treat diabetes. In 2015 clinical trials were beginning of the use of chlorotoxin with a fluorescent molecule attached as brain tumour \\"paint\\" (BLZ-100), to mark cancerous cells in real time during an operation. This is important in brain cancer surgery, where it is vital both to remove as many cancerous cells as possible, but not to remove healthy tissue necessary for brain functioning. In preclinical animal trials the technique could highlight extremely small clusters of as few as 200 cancer cells, compared to the standard use of MRI, with a lower limit in excess of 500,000.  Legality  Possession of L.quinquestriatus may be illegal or regulated in countries with laws prohibiting the keeping of dangerous animals in general. Jurisdictions are increasingly and explicitly including L.quinquestriatus in laws requiring permits to keep animals which are not usual pets, or restricting possession of dangerous animals, and in some cases have prohibited the keeping of L.quinquestriatus save by licensed zoos and educational facilities. In several jurisdictions departments of fish and wildlife require permits for many animals,In the UK a licence is required under the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act and a number of cities and municipal governments have prohibited their possession in their bylaws.

Agyen's research agenda includes both theoretical and applied linguistics, encompassing morphosyntax, language education, and many Turkic languages, particularly Turkish, her native language. She is currently a Distinguished Teaching Professor of linguistics at Northern Illinois University. She has been interviewed on many topics in linguistics, including the language of social media, the significance and benefits of heritage languages such as Kurdish, lexical properties of certain words in the political discourse, and language acquisition. Aygen's wider intellectual interests have led her to translate dozens of articles, a book, and edit many translated books from English to Turkish, transcribe and edit old Ottoman manuscripts. The 8th edition of her translation of Elias Canetti‚Äôs Crowds and Power was published in 1998.  Research Agenda  In theoretical linguistics, she has worked extensively on the nature of finiteness, case, and agreement regarding clausal architecture in the world's languages, as well as the structure of reduced relative clauses and embedded clauses, specificity, scrambling, the copula. In applied linguistics and language education, she cultivated an approach to English grammar, a descriptive linguistics approach not only to assist language learners of all levels to develop and refine their English language use, but also to help those language users understand the deeper structures behind the language, empowering them to not depend on simple memorization. In her book English Grammar: a descriptive linguistics approach, she bridges the so-called contradiction between descriptive and prescriptive grammar by developing a new framework with which prescriptive grammar can be re-analyzed using the linguistic tools of descriptive linguistics. This approach has been adopted to teach English grammar to native speakers or non- native speakers of English. The same approach has been adopted to teaching different aspects of English, such as writing. In Word Choice Errors: A descriptive linguistics approach, this descriptive linguistics approach is applied by enabling language learners to understand their choice of words at a true descriptive linguistics level. In languages other than English, Aygen also worked and published on teaching Turkish as a second language, English as a second language, and gave talks on teaching Kurdish as a second language. She has also authored reference grammars of Kurmanji Kurdish and Kirmancki/Zazaki Kurdish. In sociolinguistics, she has worked on the languages of the Grand Bazaar and in media studies on syntax of the TV series Frasier. She has also co-authored work on morphosyntax of agrammatic aphasia, neurology, and history of neuroscience.  Education  Aygen received her Ph.D. in linguistics from Harvard University, after completing her graduate studies at Harvard and MIT (1998‚Äì2002).

It is his third book in the Jack Ryan Jr. series, which is part of the overall Tom Clancy universe. The novel depicts a breach in the U.S. intelligence community that is connected to Ryan's mission in Poland. It debuted at number three on the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary A mysterious hacker known as CHIBI has been offering classified information to Iranian and Russian intelligence, which then cause a series of attacks on special operations units stationed in Argentina and Syria, respectively. Additionally, a German police officer working undercover in a drug case was killed in a mugging by Iron Syndicate operatives using information from the hacker. The demonstrated attacks then enable the three parties to participate in a secret silent auction to be held by CHIBI in London. Meanwhile, Lawrence Fung is a hacker working for the red team of the recently built IC Cloud, a cloud database storing classified information gathered by the U.S. intelligence community. His job is to exploit any vulnerabilities in the database and patch them. However, he is revealed to be working with CHIBI for ideological reasons, and has been helping him with gathering actionable intelligence for the recent attacks. U.S. senator Deborah Dixon withdraws her support for a foreign policy bill, which would have allowed the construction of a U.S. military base in Poland to counter Russian aggression. President Jack Ryan is convinced that the senator had changed her mind due to her connections with the Chinese, who stand to benefit due to the Belt and Road Initiative, an extensive trade route plan spanning Eurasia which has been bankrolling several interested Western businessmen including Dixon's husband, billionaire Aaron Gage. He discreetly orders an investigation into Dixon's finances. Hendley Associates financial analyst Jack Ryan Jr. is tasked with the Dixon investigation. He finds out that Dixon's stepson, businessman Christopher Gage, does business with Chinese interests in Poland. He travels there, accompanied by Polish intelligence officer Liliana Pilecki, to look for illegal activities in Gage's businesses under the guise of researching for investment opportunities in the country. Initially finding nothing incriminating, they later investigate a Gage-owned warehouse in the Gda≈Ñsk shipyards. They are then abducted and tortured for information by Mathieu Cluzet, a French drug smuggler working for the Iron Syndicate (an organization Ryan had tangled with in previous novel Line of Sight). Afterwards, Cluzet throws Ryan and Pilecki out of his ship in the middle of the Baltic Sea. While Jack is later rescued, his partner drowns. Meanwhile, in Angola, a local rebel force attacks an offshore oil rig under construction by the Chinese. Pressed by his superiors for retribution, Chinese intelligence officer Chen Xing turns to CHIBI for information about the rebel force's whereabouts. The hacker then orders Fung to pinpoint the location of the rebels. Using CHIBI's information, the PLA stages a surgical attack on the Angolan rebels, enabling Xing and Chinese intelligence to enter the auction. The attack on the rebels attracts the attention of Director of National Intelligence Mary Pat Foley. She later finds out that the recent attacks in Argentina, Germany, Syria, and now Angola may have been the result of an intelligence breach within the IC Cloud. The cloud's head of security, Amanda Watson, imparts her suspicions about her colleague Fung, which leads Foley to track him down. However, CHIBI finds out about the manhunt and orders Fung's death, disguised as a suicide. Foley's investigation into the breach prematurely ends. After recuperating in Virginia, Jack travels to Peru to honor his recently deceased friend Cory Chase's wishes. Still distraught over Liliana's death, he later discovers an illegal mining operation led by Cluzet's unnamed brother. Along with former U.S. Army Ranger Rick Sands, whom he had met in the area, Jack dispatches him and his men and then rescues the miners taken against their will. Later reunited with his Campus colleagues, Jack tracks down the leader of the Iron Syndicate, known as the Czech, in the former Czech Republic. He instead reveals CHIBI's plot about the auction of an algorithmic key that would unlock the entire IC Cloud in a tech conference in London. The Campus, as well as Foley, scramble into London to track down CHIBI, who is revealed to be Watson. While the auction is still successful, Foley devises a plan to penetrate the Chinese, Iranian, and Russian intelligence agencies, while Watson is later sentenced to prison. President Ryan informs Dixon about her stepson's association with the Chinese, which is by smuggling drugs around Europe and then laundering the dirty money produced into the senator's charities. After being informed of her brief investigation into Hendley Associates, he blackmails the senator into passing an anticorruption bill instead of being disgraced from politics. Meanwhile, Foley works on dismantling the Iron Syndicate, now deemed a national security threat. Gage is found dead in the Gda≈Ñsk shipyards, while the Czech is killed by a sniper working for Polish intelligence. Jack tracks down Cluzet in Libya and kills him in revenge for Liliana's death.

It was the first theme park in Brazil and in Latin America. It opened on October 10, 1968.Coluna Mem√≥ria, do jornal Di√°rio do Grande ABC, de 10 de outubro de 2008. It was divided into three themed areas. One of the themes is the Amazon, containing a replica of the Amazon Theatre, the Madeira-Mamor√© Railroad and several other characteristic figures of the region. Among its most famous attractions, is a replica of a submarine (with 2.75 million liters of water that was the first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere and the third overall park with this attraction), a plane, the Minhoc√£o (roller coaster), the Casa Maluca (Crazy House), among others. The park was built in the 1950s as a studio for recording the soap opera Reden√ß√£o, from TV Excelsior. Even after the end of the soap opera in 1968, visits by the public to the city continued. This was also the first Brazilian film city. The land and area built for the recording of the soap opera Reden√ß√£o were listed by the Municipal Council of Historical and Cultural Heritage in 1990. Vera Cruz Studios Vera Cruz Studios are adjacent to the grounds of the Cidade da Crian√ßa. At the beginning of the soap opera Reden√ß√£o, a city from the interior of S√£o Paulo was built on that 37,742m¬≤ plot that had been ceded by the City Hall, with a church, police station, forum, train station and some houses as requested by the script. This scene still exists, and is in the Reden√ß√£o region. After the end of the recordings, the land was returned to City Hall, and soon after, then Mayor Aldino Pinotti entered into a public-private partnership for the addition of attractions. Closing Attendance peaked in the 70's and 80's, after which the park went into decline, suffering from competition from Playcenter and Hopi Hari, was reformed in 1970 and had a period of expansion from 1971 to 1976. In 2005 it was closed by the S√£o Bernardo do Campo City Hall due to lack of security and lack of equipment maintenance; the town hall was planning to make the park an educational site. At the time of closing, several attractions managed by third parties were in poor condition. The project to transform Cidade da Crian√ßa into an educational park suffered some setbacks, as the S√£o Paulo State Court of Auditors rejected the resources proposed from the Department of Education, given that the space was not built from a pedagogical project. As a result, the city intended to launch a concession bid for the operation and maintenance of the park. =Closure due to Coronavirus= Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, Mayor Orlando Morando closed the Cidade da Crian√ßa and other municipal parks on March 21, 2020, until October 10, 2020, with security protocols. Reopening The park was reopened to the public on January 17, 2010. At this time, the cable car and submarine attractions were still closed. The park has been widely criticized by the press and visitors during its reopening. Having been closed for renovations for five years, the public expected to find a completely new park, which did not materialize. On the day of the park's reopening, more than 20,000 visitors were surprised by the absence of attractions: only 18 were available. On the same day of the inauguration, the simulator was closed because the air conditioner broke down. Facing criticism, the then Mayor Luiz Marinho proposed a project to open new attractions by the end of that year. The project, almost completed by the city government, would bring new attractions to the park by December. The new attractions are: Minhoc√£o (mini roller coaster), 'Splash', elevator, 'Ferrari Carousel', bumper car, 'Twist', ferris wheel, among others. =\\"Mirim Town Hall\\"= Together with the City Hall of S√£o Bernardo do Campo, \\"Mayor Mirim\\" elections are held in the Cidade da Crian√ßa. This town hall is a project for 4th to 5th grade students elementary school (from public or private schools). When a child is elected, they will participate in the administration of the park. The mandate is voluntary and lasts for a biennium. Assignments The attributions of the Mayor Mirim are: * Know, through the Department of Tourism and Events of S√£o Bernardo do Campo, relevant actions related to the Cidade da Crian√ßa; * Attend quarterly meetings with the staff of the S√£o Bernardo do Campo Department of Tourism and Events and present suggestions from residents and users; * Read and forward emails from residents and park users with proposals, suggestions and complaints about Cidade da Crian√ßa park, as briefly as possible, to the Tourism and Events Department; * At the end of his term, present a report on his experience as Mayor Mirim of Cidade da Crian√ßa. =Benefits= The benefits are: * The ability to invite five friends a month to the park; * Your own institutional email; * The possibility to accompany the Department of Tourism in events related to the park. Incident On July 24, 2019, Ilma Pereira, who was next to her six-year-old daughter, dropped 1.5m (4,9 feet) high from the children's roller coaster \\"Brocumela\\", which reaches a maximum height of 5 meters (16 feet). According to witnesses, she would have passed out. Sao Paulo Fire Department and SAMU were called at 11:10 (BRT). She was referred to the Mario Covas Hospital (Santo Andr√©), with entrance at 12:30 (BRT) and the death was reported by the institution around 14:20 (BRT). According to the hospital, Ilma had cranial polytrauma. A report from the Santo Andr√© Legal Medical Institute indicates that the cause of death was head trauma. Ilma hit her head three times on the toy's support beams before falling to the floor. In a Notice published on Instagram the park gave solidarity to the victim's family, which \\"awaits expert and medical reports to clarify the incident\\" and that in \\"50 years of history, this is the first incident recorded in the Cidade da Crian√ßa.\\" The police investigated whether the park had an emergency structure and according to S√£o Bernardo do Campo's 1st DP holder, until July 25, 2019 the park had not presented a safety report. The Civil Police inspected the attraction and the City Hall of S√£o Bernardo do Campo reported that the park had the Fire Department Surveyor to operate and it meets all operating standards. However, the park kept the roller coaster out of operation until the causes of the incident are clarified. Ilma Pereira was veiled on July 26, 2019. Delegate Alberto Jos√© Mesquita Alves, from the 1st Police District of S√£o Bernardo, cited the need for eventual investigation of manslaughter.

Shanti explored themes of self-love and healing, and blended R&B;, soul, and jazz music. Her debut EP drew praise from Sidney Madden of NPR for her \\"cool delivery and chill-inducing falsetto runs\\" and \\"astute songwriting chops\\". She directed several of her own music videos where she displayed her Indian heritage and \\"rich interiority of women of color like herself\\". In the summer of 2018, she was included in ModCloth's Say It Louder campaign, which aimed to celebrate individuality and strong female icons in music. She was featured alongside other outspoken female musicians like Lizzo, Awkwafina and Hayley Kiyoko. In November 2018, she performed at Tyler, The Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival. In March 2019, Aurora co-headlined the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia, with H.E.R and Toto. On May 31, 2019, she released her debut album Lucid, distributed through Empire Distribution. Lyrically, she explored sensuality, healing from trauma, and spirituality; through tracks like \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Salt Water\\", she opened up about her experience as a sexual assault and abuse survivor.Lucid was met with very positive reviews. Sidney Madden of NPR described Lucid as \\"comforting but nuanced, balancing cultures old and new by mashing up contemporary R&B; with traditions from the South Asian diaspora\\". In a track review for the penultimate track, \\"Petal\\", Vrinda Jagota from Pitchfork wrote: \\"over the course of 12 songs, her sound becomes bolder and clearer, finding strength in everything from sun showers to her mother‚Äôs resilience to her own femininity and womanhood\\". \\"Lucid\\" was named one of the \\"Best Albums of 2019\\" by NPR. Aurora's 2019 single \\"Stronger\\" was named one of the \\"100 Best Songs of 2019\\" by Noisey. Personal life Aurora is openly bisexual.

Harold Fletcher became interested in fossils at an early age, undertook studies in zoology and geology, and worked for the museum in cadetship. His first major field trip was an expedition to Lake Eyre, led by Gerald Harnett Halligan, taking along boats in the expectation of finding islands surrounded by lakes or an inland sea. Fletcher was also engaged in expeditions to Mount Kosciuszko, making collections of invertebrates and plant material in 1929, and made an attempted crossing of the Simpson Desert as second in command to the geologist Cecil Madigan. He was involved in the discovery of a remarkable fossil find at Canowindra, a slab of Devonian rock preserving the remains of one hundred fish. He made many expeditions in sometimes highly adverse conditions, often field trips to obtain fossil specimens, and reported his findings and observations in articles published in the Records and Magazine of his museum.

It stands next to the modern day opera house. Built beneath the ground in 1632, it is the oldest church in the city and was constructed during the period of Ottoman occupation. As it keeps the holy relics of a number of saints, Ruse's cathedral is often visited by pilgrims. Its rich history and underground interior also pose an interest for tourists, making it one of the main attractions of the city. As one of the oldest buildings in Ruse, the Holy Trinity Cathedral was declared a cultural monument of national importance in 1983. It is continually cared for and maintained in order to be preserved for generations to come. Architecture It is a three-nave pseudo-basilica that is 31.20 m long and 15.60 m wide. Two rows of seven columns separate the naves. It was dug four and a half meters below the level of the yard due to the requirements of Ottoman authorities. The remains of catacombs, possibly dating back to the fifth century, are located in the southwest corner of the temple. During Ottoman rule, it was easier to issue permission for the construction of a new church at the location of an older temple. The Christians of Ruse presumably used the old catacomb to build the church. The hexagonal belfry is 19 m high and was built with stones from the fortification facilities around the Ruschuk fortress, demolished by decision of the Berlin Congress from July 1878. There are five bells in the belfry. In the cathedral's narthex are the graves of four bishops of the Dorostolo-Cherven diocese: Grigoriy, Valisiy, Mihail, and Sofroniy. Design and construction The exterior of the Holy Trinity cathedral. Underground interior of the cathedral. The origin of the iconostasis has not yet been clarified, it was made in 1805 ‚Äì 1807, then the icons were painted. During the period 1989 ‚Äì 2000, a complete restoration of the iconostasis by Irina and Vaclav Yosif Kopetski from Sofia was carried out. A church choir was created in 1870, based on the idea of the teacher Todor Hadjistanchev. After the beginning of the 20th century, it became the only church choir in Bulgaria on an annual state subsidy. Two chapels were built with donations after the liberation of Bulgaria, giving the current exterior appearance of the temple. The first chapel is dedicated to Alexander Nevsky and was consecrated on 5 August 1884. It was rebuilt in 1983 and contained a museum exposition for church plates, icons, and old printed books. The second chapel is dedicated to the Holy Brothers Cyril and Methodius. It was consecrated on 16 March 1886 by Metropolitan Gregory Dorostolski and Chervenski. The wooden stairs from which the temple was entered and separated by a railing were replaced by stairs made of stone. Above them, a beautiful cube in Russian style and a bell tower were constructed. The walls of the temple were painted in 1934 by Prof. Stefan Ivanov and Mr. Zhelyazkov.

They are considered core contributors to the tradition of British psychogeography, and part of what Tina Richardson has identified as the 'new psychogeography'. The LRM have also been identified as contributing to the visibility and practices of walking women: they were featured on the BBC Radio 4 broadcast, 'The Art of Now: Women Who Walk' (2018), and are also included in the Live Art Development Agency's Study Room Guide on WALKING WOMEN (2015).  History  Founded in 2006 by Morag Rose, the Loiterers Resistance Movement (LRM) is ‚Äòa Situationist-inspired psychogeography group that roams the city sharing knowledge and experiences of the ever-changing urban environment.' On the first Sunday of every month they facilitate ‚Äòa free communal wander, open to anyone curious about the potential of public space and unravelling stories hidden within our everyday landscape.‚Äô The LRM does not have requirement for consistent membership and ‚Äòpeople float in and out and define their own level of commitment. Rose identifies it ‚Äòas a free floating community‚Äô, stating, ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt tend to show up every month like clockwork, but it‚Äôs also rare to only see a face once.‚Äô Rose founded the group 'motivated by love and curiosity for Manchester and a concern, sometimes rage, at the damage neoliberalism causes to our communities.' The LRM is part of the Walking Artists Network, and participate in network discussions and events. In 2017, Rose was awarded the Living Streets Charles Maher Award for her work with the LRM and her contributions to and engagement with the public space of Manchester.  Theory and Practice  The LRM draws on the practice of the d√©rive and the concept of psychogeography, first theorised by the Letterist International, and further developed by the Situationist International. The LRM describes the d√©rive as 'a way of walking across the city which ignores normal conventions of going from A to B. Instead [the] route is guided by playfulness, feeling and instinct.' They note that a 'variety of methods can be used to shape a wander' and that each exploration is unique and 'shaped by whoever turns up on the day'. Following the Situationist focus on practice, Rose states, 'the LRM do agree that psychogeography has to be practice as well as theory; that praxis belongs on the street and is shaped by our footsteps.' For Rose, 'the d√©rive 'offers alternative ways to think about space and walking together helps to connect, interrogate and explore our city.' The group looks to ‚Äòcomplicate the official narrative and deviate from the official tour‚Äô and explore the city as a site of multiple narratives, diversity and personal history‚Äô Over their ten year history the LRM has engaged the city in a variety of ways. These include 'an attempt to ‚Äúdematerialise‚Äù the new Beetham Tower', and 'impromptu concert with kazoos and tambourines' in an underground car park. = LRM Manifesto = The LRM is guided by a manifesto, founded on the principle that ‚Äòthe Streets belong to everyone‚Äô, which Rose identifies as ‚Äòan aspiration, not a statement of fact.‚Äô > We can‚Äôt agree on what psychogeography means but we all like plants growing > out of the side of buildings, looking at things from new angles, radical > history, drinking tea and getting lost; having fun and feeling like a > tourist in your home town. Gentrification, advertising and blandness makes > us sad. We believe there is magic in the Mancunian rain. Our city is > wonderful and made for more than shopping. The streets belong to everyone > and we want to reclaim them for play and revolutionary fun. = Loitering With Intent (2016) = In 2016 the LRM curated the Arts Council England funded exhibition Loitering with Intent at the People‚Äôs History Museum in Manchester. The exhibition had ‚Äòan explicit political agenda to uncover the powerful dynamics that shape Manchester and offer an alternative way to view them.‚Äô The exhibition featured 'material from The LRM archive, documenting [their] expeditions as well as posters, found objects and handcrafted items used to guide walks such as CCTV Bingo Cards, game pieces made from metal salvaged from car manufacturing and maps transformed into fortune tellers', as well as 'contributions from local, national and international artists inspired by psychogeography' in the form of 'film, drawing, painting, DIY maps, photographs' and a variety of other media.

Early life  Thomas's interest in military rations began in 1997 when his father purchased a case of US rations from an Army Navy Store. The first ration Thomas ate from the case was a ham slice meal manufactured in 1993, which he ate cold because he did not know how to use the heating device.  Internet career  Steve began his YouTube channel in November 2015 and first gained notoriety in January 2016 for a video in which he ate 61-year-old peanut butter from a Korean War-era Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). Later that year, a video review of Steve eating American Civil War-era hardtack from 1863 went viral. Steve has opened, eaten and reviewed a variety of military chocolate, including the notorious World War II-era D ration and Tropical Bar, both manufactured by the Hershey Company. Prior to 1975 several U.S. military rations contained cigarettes, and Steve does smoke and review the cigarettes in older rations, with the oldest cigarette smoked being a cigarette dating to 1942, making it 75 years old when it was smoked. He has reviewed rations from the British Royal Air Force, Royal Canadian Navy, Russian Special Forces and both vintage and contemporary rations from a wide variety of armed forces from all over the world. Steve took a brief hiatus in the middle of 2020 due to injuring tendons in his right arm, according to his pinned YouTube comment in the comment section of his video, \\"1993 US MRE Smoked Frankfurters Review Vintage Meal Ready to Eat Tasting Test\\". As soon as the brace was removed from his arm, he made the video. Despite eating rations that are well beyond the recommended shelf life specified by Natick Laboratories and other manufacturers, Steve has reported that he rarely becomes ill, though he did contract E. coli and had to be hospitalized in 2015, ironically from a ration that was actually within its shelf life. Thomas described a cheese spread from a 1987 MRE as \\"the grossest thing I've ever tasted, because it literally felt like fire. And bitterness.\\" Because many of the rations Steve opens are extremely rare, he has stated that he will only open and review a ration once he has obtained a duplicate that will remain unopened in a private collection. His video voice-overs have gained traction within his subscriber community for their calm delivery, and signature catch-phrases such as \\"nice hiss\\" (when opening a can or pouch resulting in air evacuation), and \\"let's get this out onto a tray. Nice!\\" referencing laying out the ration items onto a table, before hard-cutting to them neatly arrayed on a military-style food tray. Despite his dedication to military rations, Steve has not served in the military.

Ashley, Cheshire, Brereton's birthplace He was born in Ashley, Cheshire, one of the eight sons of George Brereton of Ashley Hall and Sybil Arderne, daughter of William Arderne of Timperley, near Altrincham. The Breretons were descended from Sir William Brereton, who was Earl Marshal of Ireland in the time of Henry VIII. John was baptised at the parish church in Bowdon on 20 June 1576. He attended Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, of which he was later to be a generous benefactor. He practiced as an attorney for some years and was then called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1609. He moved to Ireland and was admitted to the King's Inn in 1613. He was appointed the Irish Prime Serjeant in 1617, with a knighthood, and served in that office until his death on 1 October 1629. In his will he left a generous bequest to Sidney Sussex College, and divided the remainder of his estate between his wife Elizabeth and his brother Randal. Elizabeth was the widow of George Montgomery, Bishop of Meath: she was the daughter of Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee and his wife Mary Smythe, and sister of William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath. In 1631 she remarried Sir John Bramston, the Lord Chief Justice of England. She and Bramston had been in love when they were young, but her father had forbidden the marriage. Her Bramston stepchildren described her unflatteringly in her middle years as small, fat. red-faced and homely, but praised her as a good wife and a kindly stepmother. She died in 1647.

The school provides public education to students from years 7 to 12. It prepares students for the Higher School Certificate (HSC) in Year 12, and the Record of School Achievement (RoSA) for those students who wish to leave school before obtaining the HSC. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2014.  History  = Proposal = On 3 June 1962, a new school was proposed in the Blacktown South region due to the rising population demands in Western Sydney. At the time of the proposal, only three government schools existed in the area ‚Äì Blacktown Boys High School, Blacktown Girls High School and Seven Hills High School. = Construction =  Planning  The school's development was divided into two sections, referred to as stage 1 and stage 2 which both included construction of the main classroom blocks: A, B, C, and D. The final sections in developing the school not included in the initial two stages were building block E, the school hall and the current dedicated school administration office.  Building  = Initial stages = The landscape which the school was provided totalled 6.3 hectares in area, which equated to a final cost of approximately ¬£332,850 ($665,700), which also included the development of stage 1 and stage 2. The two initial stages were completed on 10 June 1964 and the students and staff expected to attend Mitchell High School were moved out of the temporary classes at a school on Hereward Highway and at Blacktown Boys High School and Blacktown Girls High School respectively that they had started the year in. Mr Frank Doyle became the first principal of the school. = E block, school hall, and school administration office = Following the initial construction stages, E block was later completed in 1966 at a price of ¬£90,738 ($181,476). The school hall was then opened on 23 December 1975, and then the current dedicated administration office was opened on 5 August 1993, moving out of the current location of the school library. = D block floor change = Due to the relocation of the administration office in 1993, the lower floor of the original D block was completely changed. The original foyer to the school became a performance space for dance and drama and consequently the embedded brass and marble school crest, which had been donated to the school by Mr Joseph Zarb, the original builder, was covered by the new dance flooring. A photograph of the covered marble crest currently hangs in the waiting room at the school administration office. This also resulted in the library being extended and allowed for space for more classrooms.

Beamish was imprisoned and force-fed and was one of the first to be released under the \\"Cat and Mouse\\" Act and later sentenced to 18 months with hard labour.  Early life  Agnes Olive Beamish was born in Cork in Ireland. Her father was a Protestant farmer. She had brothers. Her parents supported their daughter joining Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1906 and she wore their badge to school, whilst living in Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, England where they were had moved to by 1901. Beamish felt the inferior status of women when her brothers were able to engage in politics for the 1905 election, saying \\"I felt the position keenly, that I would never be equal to them in the political world, and I also realised the inferior position of women, everywhere.\\" Beamish studied at Girton College Cambridge, mathematics and economics in 1912.  Suffrage activism  'Cat and Mouse' Act Beamish began to organise for the WSPU at Battersea London as well as in the East End where she attacked a pillarbox. On 19 March 1913, Trevethan, a mansion house in Egham, Surrey ( whose owner Lady White was out of the country) was ruined in an arson attack and fire, and messages were found in the garden referring to suffragette slogans, including \\"Stop torturing our comrades in prison\\" and \\"Votes for Women\\". Beamish was said by a local policeman as one of the two women cycling very fast, without lights, at one a.m. that night and she was identified under the pseudonym 'Phyllis Brady'. And less than a month later, she was setting fire to Sanderstead station but not caught, and again \\"Phyllis Brady\\"/ Beamish was with Elsie Duval and both were arrested in Mitcham, with paraffin and other inflamables in suitcases. Beamish was sentenced to six weeks in Holloway prison. Beamish went on hunger strike and was force fed. She and Elsie Duval were the first to be released on 28th April 1913 under what became known as the 'Cat and Mouse' Act i.e. the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913 . This allowed prisoners who may be at risk of dying from hunger strike/force feeding to be released on licence to recover and be re- arrested to complete their sentence later. Beamish went to Regents Park area, London and continued militant activities. The WSPU HQ was asked about the whereabouts of the three released under the Act by the Daily Mirror and a spokeswoman talked about the cat being away and the mice able to play, and explained their intentions to make this Act as 'ridiculous as anything the Government has done to frustrate our movement\\" and threatened that suffragettes had plans 'of which they little dream.\\" Dr Flora Murray wrote to the Glasgow Herald that she had carried out urine tests on Kitty Marion and Beamish during their hunger strike, and found high levels of a hypnotic drug bromide which was used as a muscle relaxant (to prevent vomiting during force feeding) which the doctor said \\"could only be harmful\\", and that as Beamish was preparing her defence for the trial, she may have tried to obtain an emetic to make herself vomit the hypnotic drugs. A survelliance image of Olive Beamish (Phyllis Brady) in Holloway prison is in the Museum of London archive.  Later life  During the First World War, Beamish was a social organiser based in Hoxton. She then ran her own typing agency business for 21 years in the City of London to 1930, and was on the executive of the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries.

In 2011, the station refocussed following the end of its grant funding. The organisation already engaged with a diverse range of people across the city, and stated on its website that it would change direction to aim to \\"(empower) people of all ages, all abilities with training and development in radio broadcasting\\". It was also in 2011 that the organisation registered on the Mutuals Register as a Community Interest Company.  Current activities  The station now has 50 active volunteers broadcasting to a 100,000 plus population in the region. The station can often be seen at events in the city, such as Newport County and Dragons sporting events, major entertainment and cultural occasions, and the 2019 Record Store Day in the city. Each year the station organises the Love Live Music Song Contest, aimed at exposing local songwriters and composers to a wider audience, with an awards night held at The NEON each year. In 2017, the station took part in #WeStandTogether, an event held in tribute to the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, alongside Newport City Council, SEWREC, and the Islamic Society of Wales, with the occasion led particularly by young people and families of the same age as those who were victims of the attack. Young people from the station provided a live music set and words of reflection.

The squats were used by feminist, environmentalists, LGBTI, anti-racist and other cultural groups. Between 2017 and 2019, the La Ingobernable was based in a municipal building located at the corner of Paseo del Prado and Calle del Gobernador (hence its name, which means ungovernable). It was then located at Calle Alberto Bosch 4, behind the Prado Museum from March until April 2020, when it was evicted during the state of alarm.  Paseo del Prado  Assembly of La Ingobernable The 3,000m¬≤ building in the centre of Madrid had previously been the headquarters of UNED and a health centre before being left empty. Four years later, in 2017, when the new plans were stalled and the building was derelict, representatives of social movements and civil society organisations from Madrid squatted the building with the intention of claiming public spaces in the city for the neighbourhood. It was occupied on 6 May, 2017, fulfilling the desire of activists to have a self-managed social centre in the heart of the city. A month after being occupied, La Ingobernable claimed to have organized 135 activities, 81 of them cultural. After two years, it was estimated that more than 100,000 people have attended over 170 monthly activities that the social centre organizes and communicates through its website and social networks. Hundreds of people go there every week to participate in a talk, workshop, assembly, exhibition or concert. Inside there is a self-managed bar service, a free clothing store, film library, art workshop and children's space, amongst other things. La Ingobernable served as a logistics centre during the two feminist strikes of 8 March in 2018 and 2019. As well as feminist collectives, the space was used by environmentalists, LGBTI, anti-racist and cultural groups. Demonstration in support of La Ingobernable The first eviction order for La Ingobernable was issued in April 2018 but was not executed. There was a second attempt to evict in June 2018, which also unsuccessful. The centre had called for a day of resistance and met the municipal agents with churros. A spokesperson stated that the centre had offered to undergo a legalisation process but the council was not interested. On 11 May 2019, between 700 and 800 people made a demonstration in support of La Ingobernable on the occasion of its second birthday. The centre was evicted on 13 November, 2019, by a police operation which began at 03.00 and involved 130 agents.  Calle Alberto Bosch  The new occupied building in calle Alberto Bosch After a demonstration on 4 March 2020 which began in front of the Madrid Stock Exchange, La Ingobernable occupied a new building at Calle Alberto Bosch 4, behind the Prado Museum. The former Archivo General de Protocolos building was over 2000m¬≥ and located in one of the most expensive residential areas in the city. It had been empty for five years and was owned by the Ministry of Justice. When the state of alarm began on 14 March because of the coronavirus pandemic, the ministry began an eviction process which La Ingobernable said it had been unable to participate in. The notice of eviction was announced on 14 April, to occur within 48 hours. In the end, the building was evicted on 22 April 2020. There was nobody inside at the time and neighbours told the group the locks had been changed. La Ingobernable was only able to protest online on social media networks. After the eviction, the collective stated it was having internet meetings of 50 people and would squat a new building after the state of alarm was lifted, saying \\"La Ingobernable is a project which goes beyond a space\\".

Founded in 1920 as an African-American cemetery, the cemetery is no longer commercially active, but has drawn attention for large- scale disinterment in the wake of construction and its long-term state of disrepair.  History  Washington Park Cemetery was founded in 1920 by businessmen Andrew Henry Watson and Joseph John Hauer as a for-profit, perpetual-care burial site for African Americans, eventually becoming the largest African-American cemetery in the St. Louis region at the time. Whites opposed the construction of the cemetery and though Watson and Hauer were supportive of segregationist notions regarding land rights, equal interment, and use of public parks, they defended the rights of black visitors to picnic on the grounds. As a result, they were the subject of criticism for ‚Äúdisrupting bucolic country land with the presence of black St. Louisans.‚Äù Beginning in the latter half of the century, the cemetery was impacted by three construction projects. In the late 1950s, 75 acres were claimed for Interstate 70, which bisected the cemetery's property and paved over graves. In 1972, an expansion to the St. Louis Lambert International Airport claimed nine acres. In 1992, an expansion to St. Louis's light rail system, MetroLink, claimed more land. Across these three projects, an estimated 11,974 to 13,600 bodies were disinterred and relocated, resulting in some families losing track of their ancestral graves. The cemetery ceased business operations in 1980, but has since drawn the attention of activists and media for its management, disrepair, and for billboards placed in the cemetery's grounds. The city of Berkeley purchased the cemetery in 2019 for $30.

She later became joint principal of an independent school in New York, USA.  Life and career  Jane Kenney was born in Lees (now Oldham), the eighth child of a family of twelve siblings (eleven of whom survived infancy) of Horatio Nelson Kenney (1849‚Äì1912) and Ann Wood (1852‚Äì1905) both cotton workers. Her father was from Ashton-under-Lyne whose parents were blacksmith's labourer, William and Agnes. Her mother's father was James Wood, a cotton mill worker. Her parents were married in April 1873 at Leesfield parish church, and are buried at Greenacres cemetery, Oldham. Although they lived in poverty, and were largely home educated due to working from a young age, both their parents encouraged them to read and debate. Kenney began working in the cotton mill as a card room hand, but later became a teacher as did two other girls. One brother became a businessman, and another brother Roland became the first editor of the Daily Herald, and later worked in the UK diplomatic service. Their mother died young at fifty-three, at their home at 71 Redgrave Street, Oldham. Kenney was a Montessori teacher, as was her older sister Caroline (Kitty). Jane taught in Accrington, then went to Rome as a student with Maria Montessori 1914, becoming Montessori 'demonstrator' in England.  Suffragette activism  Kenney joined the suffragettes, following leading activists, her sisters Annie and Jessie of the Women's Social and Political Union ( WSPU) Cat and Mouse Act poster Kenney offered refuge or rest for women released following imprisonment, hunger strike and force-feeding, under the Cat and Mouse Act, where she and her sister Caroline (Kitty) ran a Montessori school, at Tower Cressy, Campden Hill, from around 1915. The grand house had been acquired by the Pankhursts, including using money from the WSPU surplus funds to be fitted out for an adoption home and nursery, causing some controversy. There was also a tension with Nurse Pine who was there to nurse the women, but did not approve of the liberal education methods of Montessori.  Move to USA  In 1916, the two sisters (Jenny and Kitty) went to the USA as joint teachers in charge, appointed by Jessica Garretson Finch to run the preparatory school for female pupils moving onto the Lenox School, New York. They retired as joint principals in 1929, when the school had grown to 170 students and 24 staff on the faculty and then taught in Philadelphia before settling in California.

Her works have been featured in exhibits and permanent collections of various museums like the Heard Museum, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Peabody Essex Museum, Philbrook Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, among others. In 2015, she and her sister, Teri Greeves were honored as Living Treasures by the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Early life Keri Sue Greeves was born in 1971 on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Lander, Wyoming to Jeri Ah-be-hill and Richard V. Greeves. Her father was an artist and sculptor of Italian-American heritage and her mother, a member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma with Comanche heritage, ran the trading post at Fort Washakie for nearly thirty years. She and her older sister, Teri grew up on the Eastern Shoshone, rather than the Northern Arapaho part of Wind River Reservation and were strongly influenced by their parents. As a child, Keri watched her father pour metal in his forge for his sculpture and was fascinated by his foundry. She learned both rebellion and an appreciation for the technical skill required for art from her father, and later said that she and her sister, \\"owe our careers to him\\". She also saw her mother market Native American goods to try to bring them to a wider audience and learned to identify the characteristics of quality work. She credits her mother for having taught her to celebrate her Kiowa heritage through her individual expression. Homeschooled until high school, she graduated from The Cambridge School of Weston, near Boston and then at her art teacher, Todd Bartel's suggestion enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design. Career After a year in 1990, Greeves decided to leave school and move to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where her mother had relocated. That year, she legally changed her name to Keri Sue Ataumbi, appending the surname of her grandmother Carrie Susie Ataumbi, after whom she had been named. She briefly worked in retail and then opened a landscaping business with a friend. Simultaneously, she began showing and selling paintings in several art galleries. When her business partner decided to go to medical school, they dissolved the partnership and Ataumbi returned to school as well. She enrolled at the Institute of American Indian Arts to improve her painting skill and after earning an associate degree in 1996, went on to further her education at the College of Santa Fe, now the Santa Fe University of Art and Design, graduating magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in painting, having minored in Art History. She was strongly influenced by her instructor Linda Swanson, who taught her to find her own vision and face critique of her work. After graduating, Ataumbi decided to pursue a master's degree and enrolled at the University of New Mexico. Within six months, she decided to leave, as she did not want to become a teacher and wanted to focus on her art. Taking a beginners course in jewelry making at a local community college, Ataumbi found her niche in the art world and began producing jewelry. Ataumbi's paintings are mixed-media abstracts which often are focused on the opposing beauty and irony of her environment. For example, on a study trip in 2000 to Indonesia, she worked on a series featuring a crumbling wall in Bali, rather than painting the lush surroundings of the island. While she was in Bali, she studied casting techniques with Nyoman Partha to improve her fabrication skills. Her sculptural choices also challenge viewer's perceptions that she must use traditional and accepted Native icons and motifs to be a Native artist. One such sculpture, a Lucite table featuring cast iron legs from a mold of Ataumbi's arms, challenges the notion of stereotyping the work of Native artist, while another, featuring 12\\" Pillsbury Doughboys explores the parallels between iconic objects and the objectifying depiction of Native people in popular culture. Another piece, more traditional, which she created for the Heard Museum is a buckskin-lined silver handbag, decorated with gold and diamond stars to represent the Kiowa Big Dipper legend. Ataumbi's jewelry work typically starts with a theme and then she creates a series of related pieces. For example, in her Insect Series, pieces focused on bees, beetles, damsel flies, water bugs, and yellow jackets. She does not strictly produce pieces with native motifs, believing that contemporary native jewelry does not have to reflect stereotypical design. Instead, her pieces often explore the connections and disconnections of value systems. In indigenous cultures, items of value included things like elk teeth, or feathers, whereas the broader culture focuses on metals and gems. Ataumbi utilizes materials from both cultural perspectives in her work. Though gold is one of her favorite mediums, she also works with silver and platinum combining metals with gemstones, buffalo horn, buckskin or porcupine quills. Her approach is artistic; rather than meticulous attention to stone setting, she combines textures like rose-cut and brilliant-cut diamonds for their artistic effect. One of her pieces, a mussel shell necklace from her Ocean Collection was featured in the touring exhibit, \\"Native Fashion Now\\", which highlighted the works of 75 different Native American fashion designers from North America. The traveling exhibit premiered at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts in 2014 and then moved to other locations like the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Portland Art Museum in Oregon before ending at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan in 2016. Ataumbi's Mommy's Collection is dedicated to reproducing some of the iconic pieces worn by her mother, who died in 2015. One of these was a silver ring originally marketed by Fred Harvey. Ataumbi's twist on the ring was to remake it in gold, setting a small diamond on the underside. It and a pair of earrings Ataumbi designed were worn by Melaw Nakehk'o at the premier of The Revenant in 2015. Another piece from the Mommy's Series featured the painted likeness of her namesake and an interpretation of the clan fetish in the shape of a turtle Carrie Susie had made at Greeve's birth. The painting was combined with metalwork and won best in class in 2016 at the Santa Fe Indian Market. In addition to her own series work, Ataumbi has had several productive collaborative associations. In conjunction with Robin Waynee (Saginaw Chippewa), in 2011 they created an insect-themed earrings-ring-necklace set which was donated to the gala auction to benefit the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA). In 2014, with beader Jamie Okuma (Luise√±o/Shoshone-Bannock), Ataumbi worked on another earrings-ring-necklace set based on historic likenesses of Pocahontas. The mixed media set, which used beads, buckskin, diamonds, fresh water pearls, antique glass, gold and indigenous wampum, was purchased for the permanent collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art. In a second collaboration inspired by the sculpture For the Love of God by Damien Hirst, Ataumbi and Okuma created For the Love of Art, featuring a Marilyn Monroe ring and skull on a bracelet. Though she and her sister, Teri, a noted beadworker, normally do not collaborate in their work, the sisters jointly spoke about heritage and art at the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, after they were honored as Living Treasures by the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture of Santa Fe in 2015. The award, given by a division of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs recognized the sisters, individually and collectively for their \\"museum-quality work\\", which incorporates a story-telling narrative of their cultural heritage.

She develops new treatments for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.  Early life and education  Monje wanted to be a physician from the age of five, when she was in kindergarten. She grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and became interested in biology as a child. Monje was a figure skater during her childhood and taught figure skating to children with developmental disabilities whilst in Junior High. She was an undergraduate student at Vassar College. Monje studied medicine at Stanford University and earned her MD‚ÄìPhD in 2004. She completed her internship at Stanford before leaving to join Harvard Medical School as a medical resident in neurology. Monje worked in the Brigham and Women's Hospital as well as the Massachusetts General Hospital. She completed a fellowship at the Stanford University School of Medicine, where she was mentored by Philip A. Beachy, and was board certified in neuro-oncology and neurological subspecialities in 2013. During her clinical training in neural development, Monje had four children.  Research and career  Her research considers the molecular mechanisms for neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. She looks at how the neural circuits responsible for cognitive and motor functions are developed, and how the microenvironment of a tumour impacts the transition of precursor cells to diseased cells. She studies brainstem tumours as a paradigm for paediatric gliogenesis. Monje works at Stanford University, where she has developed new treatments for brain cancer since 2011. She has extensively investigated Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a cancer for which it is difficult to identify effective chemotherapy and impossible to remove surgically, as the tumour grows in the brainstem. In 2009 she grew the first laboratory cultures of DIPG from deceased donors, which allowed her and her team to monitor the cell's growth and test chemotherapy agents. The tumour tissue resources developed in Monje's laboratory are shared with researchers all around the world. She also uses mouse models to test possible therapies. Monje is leading a Phase 1 clinical trial of panobinostat, a drug which slows the growth of DIPG and has been shown to increase survival rates in mice. She has also engineered immune cells including the chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells to eradicate brain tumours. This work involved screening DIPG tumour cultures for surface molecules that could be targets for CAR-T cells. Monje found that GD2 is present on the surface of 80% of DIPG tumours. Over expression of the sugar molecule is caused by the H3K27M mutation and drives the growth of tumour. Crystal Mackall developed CAR-T cells that attack the GD2, killing cultured DIPG cells which carry the H3K27M mutation. Monje's engineered cells can cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, and have been shown to greatly reduce the number of cancer cells in mice. She was board certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in Neurology in 2018. She was recognised by State senator Jerry Hill with a Certificate of Recognition in June 2019. The campaigning and research of Monje resulted in the United States renaming May 17 as Paediatric Brain Cancer Awareness Day. Her research is supported by family members of children who have suffered from DIPG. Monje serves on the advisory board of Abbie's Army, a non-profit that fights for a cure for DIPG.

Accident  The aircraft, carrying 156 passengers and crew, departed Gimpo International Airport. During landing at Pohang Airport, the aircraft had to initiate a go-around due to rain and thick clouds. During the second landing, the aircraft landed past the threshold of runway 10. For unknown reasons, the flight crew activated the thrust reverse 27 seconds after touchdown, all of this culminating in the aircraft being unable to stop in time.

It was designated a Category B listed building in 1970. History The church was built between 1849 and 1852 as the parish church of an independent congregation which had split from the George Street Congregational Church in 1849. It was built in an English Gothic revival style on the designs of John Thomas Emmett, costing a total of ¬£10,000. It is built of Kenmure sandstone. By 1874 the congregation had declined and the building was sold to James Baird, an industrialist, who donated the building to the Church of Scotland. The church was designated a Category B listed building in 1970. Congregations After the building became a Church of Scotland parish it was taken over by the Blythswood congregation and became known as Blythswood Parish Church. In 1920, the parish united with St Matthew's parish and became St Matthew's Blythswood Parish Church. St Matthew's parish was established in 1835. In 1960 St Matthew's Blythswood united with St Stephen's Buccleuch and the name was changed to St Stephen's Buccleuch Parish Church. St Stephen's parish was originally established in 1835. In 1966 the church was sold by the parish to the Renfield Street Trust to be used by Renfield Parish Church as its new church after the original Renfield street church closed in 1964 and later demolished. Renfield street parish was established in 1848 and united with the Church of Scotland in 1929. In 1967, Cowcaddens parish joined the union and the church became known as St Stephen's. In 1969, the church was refurbished and rededicated. The adjoining church centre was also built on the site of tenement flats and a chapel dedicated to St Matthew was constructed.

Then he introduced the concept of a two-terminal artificial (semiconductor) neuron (International Journal of Electronics, 63, 61, (1987), a parallel asynchronous processing based on artificial neurons (Int journal of Infrared and Millimeter Waves, 9, 1037, 1987), Neural Networks 2, 143, (1989).( Phys. Rev. Lett., 58, 1139, (1987, Neural Information Processing Systems\\", 201‚Äì210, Edited by Dana Z. Anderson, A. I. P., New York, (1988)).  Early life and education  Unil Perera was born in Sri Lanka to Mr. A. G. Weyman Perera and Mrs. Daya Perera. He had his pre- college education at Ananda College of Colombo, the premier Buddhist School in Sri Lanka founded by the Theosophical Society headed by the US visionary Henry Steel Olcott. He obtained a BSc in physics (First Class Honors) in 1981 from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. After serving as an assistant lecturer for one year, he came to University of Pittsburgh and obtained a PhD degree in experimental solid state physics in 1987. After a brief postdoctoral position at the University of Pittsburgh, he was appointed as a research assistant professor in January 1988. In 1992, he accepted an assistant professor position at Georgia State University. He has held visiting research positions at the Institute for Microstructural Studies, National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada, National Institute of Fundamental Studies, Sri Lanka, and [Technical University], Singapore.  Recognition  Perera was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), American Physical Society (APS) in 2005 and as a Fellow of the Society of Photo Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) of the Institute Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2012, he was recognized as the IEEE Photonics Society distinguished lecturer award in 2020 . He became a full professor at GSU in 2001. In 2009, College of Arts and Sciences at GSU awarded him ‚ÄúOutstanding Faculty Scholarship Award‚Äù, followed by the ‚ÄúAlumni Distinguished Professor‚Äù Award from GSU and the ‚ÄúCarl R Nave Award for the Outstanding Educator in Physics‚Äù from the Society of Physics Students, both in 2010. In 2013 GSU awarded him the title Regents‚Äô Professor of Physics. In 2012, Sri Lanka Foundation, , Sri Lanka Foundation a non-profit organization with a mission to educate the citizens of the world on Sri Lanka and the achievements of its people gave Perera their highest award‚Äù Life Time Achievement Award‚Äù. He was instrumental in establishing joint tri partite research programs with the Institute of Fundamental Science, Hantana, Sri Lanka (IFS) and the IIT- Chennai and GSU. He also established a joint PhD program with IFS, where IFS junior researchers can obtain a PhD at GSU. He also organized and chaired an international conference on Infrared detectors in Sri Lanka. He as a member of the APS international Affairs committee, organized webinars on ‚ÄúGraduate Studies in US‚Äù for the south East Asian audiences.  Research  * Homojunction Interfacial work function internal photoemission IR Detectors (HIWIP):, Homojunction interfacial workfunction internal photoemission (HIWIP) infrared detectors Rather than using specific semiconductors for specific wavelength range detection, he developed detectors which can detect IR radiation over a wide range irrespective of the semiconductor material. The idea is based on Metal insulator transitions, where a semiconductor material will behave as a metal under high doping. This will develop an interfacial workfunction (energy gap) at an interface between a highly doped and intrinsic semiconductor junction. The energy gap can be controlled by the doping, leading to a wavelength tailorable detector. (APL, 60 (25) 3168-3170 (1992), JAP 77 (2) 915-924 (1995), APL 66, 2262‚Äì2264 (1995) He used commercially available p-i-n diodes, (Silicon, Ge and InGaAs) to demonstrate a far infrared detector concept which can be used with any semiconductor material system. [App. Phys. Lett., 55, 1738, (1989), Appl. Phys. Lett., 60, 3168, (1992), Superlattice and Microstructures 14, 123‚Äì128 (1993),. LASER FOCUS WORLD, NEWSBREAKS, featured this work in their August 1992 issue. Based on these ideas a wavelength tunable infrared detector patent was awarded. [U.S. Patent # 5,030,831, issued on July 9, 1991.] A complete model to explain the wavelength tunable homojunction interfacial workfunction internal photoemission (HIWIP) detector concepts was developed. [J. Appl. Phys, 77, 915-924, (1995), Appl. Phys. Lett. 66, 2262-2264, (1995)] This idea was successfully tested in MBE grown GaAs and SI HIWIP FIR detectors. JAP 81(7) 3316-3319, 1997, APL 72(18) 2307-2309 (1998). * Quantum Well IR Detectors (QWIPS): Perera demonstrated that the Quantum well detectors can be developed to detect LWIR and VLWIR detectors by continuously extending the threshold to (a) A 14.5 micron threshold quantum well infrared detector demonstrated in 1990.[ Appl. Phys. Lett., 60, 3022, (1992).] (b) He designed and successfully demonstrated a 28-micron threshold QWIP in 1998 [Appl. Phys. Lett. 72, 1596-1598, (1998)] (c) and extended the threshold wavelength to 32 micron in 2000. [Appl. Phys. Lett, 77 741-743, (2000)] The November 2000 issue of PHOTONICS SPECTRA, TECHNOLOGY WORLD BRIEFS featured this work. In each case it was the longest threshold detected in QWIPS at the time. We reported Non- monotonic dependence of the polarization extinction ratio on the parameters of the diffraction grid in QWIP detectors in 2010. (IEEE J of Quantum Electronics 46, 6, 877, (2010). Two back-to-back connected p-i-n photodiodes with InGaAs/GaAs and GaAs/AlGaAs-based quantum wells integrated within the n-regions was designed to detect five bands covering visible to long-wave infrared was demonstrated using a GaAs-based n-p-n-architecture. {APL, 97, 231102 (2010) } * Heterojunction Interfacial Work function Internal Photoemission IR detectors (HEIWIP), Heterojunction Interfacial Work function Internal Photoemission IR detectors (HEIWIP) The hole ‚Äìhole transitions limited the HIWIP detector tailorability and also the high doping contributed to the dark current. This led to his development of Heterojunction (HEIWIP) detectors combining the free carrier idea from HIWIP and the adjustable barrier ideas from MBE growth and Quantum Well infrared detectors. [APL 78, 2241‚Äì2243 (2001), Dark current Wavelength tailorability and bias tunability was demonstrated using different Al fractions in the AlGaAs barriers. Solid State Electronics 45, 87-93, (2001), APL 82 (1) 139-141 (2003), JAP 93 (4) 1879-1883 (2003), JAP 96 (8) 4588-4597 (2004), IEEE transactions of Electron Devices, 44, 2180-2186, (1997), Appl. Phys. Lett., 71, 2677-2679, (1997)]. * Quantum Dot and Ring IR detectors (QDIP): Multicolor QDIP detectors were demonstrated. The effect of well width on the dot in a well structure was studied. [Applied Physics Letters, 83, 2745‚Äì2747 (2003), Photonics Tech. Letts, 17, 1064-1066, (2005), Photonics Tech. Letts, 17, 178-180, (2005)] The three color QDIP results were reported in the December 2003 issue of LASER FOCUS WORLD, NEWSBREAKS. Room temperature operation of a QDIP was demonstrated. [Appl. Phys. Lett, 86, 191106, (2005), IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, 41(7), 974-979, (2005)]. These ideas were extended to detect multiband detection in to the terahertz range. (APL 89, 031117, (2006), APL 92, 011117, (2008)). Quantum rings obtained by annealing the dot structures were demonstrated to detect terahertz radiation. To understand the performance the effect of the dot size and distribution on the intersublevel transmission and absorption coefficients of III-V systems was calculated. * Multiband Junction Detecors: A dual band (NIR and FIR) homojunction detector was demonstrated. [Appl. Phys. Lett, 86, 143510, (2005) & APL 89, 061112,(2006) The idea was extended to UV ‚Äì IR dual band heterojunction detectors, {APL 89, 091113 (2006) APL 89,061112 (2006). A US patent was issued No. 7838869 on Nov. 23, 2010 for this Dual Band detector. June 2005 issue of PHOTONICS SPECTRA, TECHNOLOGY NEWS reported this as their featured article. In order to detect UV and IR simultaneously and separately a three terminal device was developed (Optics Letters, Vol 33, 21, 2422-2424, 2008 ) and a patent was issued on 10/27/2011. * Split off Band IR detectors: A GaAs based Split-Off (S-O) band detector responding in 2‚Äì4 ¬µm at ambient temperature was demonstrated to work at room temperature. (APL 93, 021105 (2008). A model calculating the dark and illuminated currents from the photoabsorption, carrier escape, and transport, explaining the experimental response. (JAP 106, 1064503 (2009), was developed. Hole transitions from the heavy-hole (hh) to the light-hole (lh) band contributing to the 4‚Äì10 ¬µm response range were demonstrated on p-GaAs/AlGaAs detectors. The detectors show a spectral response up to 16.5 ¬µm, operating up to a temperature of 330 K where the lh-hh response is superimposed on the free-carrier response. (APL 97, 091104 (2010)) In contrast to conventional 1-D current models due to carrier transport based on tunneling and/or thermionic emission mechanisms, a 2-D electrical model explained non uniformity degradation of zero-bias differential resistance (R0A) with temperatures as measured on SO detectors. This 2-D characteristic of carrier transport could have limitations on high- temperature performances of detectors. Modifications such as using smaller mesa sizes, higher doping of the p+-GaAs layer, and a higher potential barrier that prospectively provides better electrical uniformity shows the possibility of working at high temperatures.(IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices Vol 57, No 6, 2010). By employing a non-symmetrical band alignment a long-wavelength photovoltaic response (up to 8 lm) in a short-wavelength p-type GaAs heterojunction detector (with the activation energy of EA 0:40 eV), operating at 80 K was demonstrated. (APL 104, 131101 (2014). We demonstrated a new, long-wavelength photodetection principle based on a hot‚Äìcold hole energy transfer mechanism that overcomes the standard cutoff wavelength limit Œªc that is related to the activation energy (or bandgap) of the semiconductor structure (or material) (Œî) through the relationship Œªc = hc/Œî. Using this we demonstrated a very long-wavelength infrared response up to 55 ¬µm, which is tunable by varying the degree of hot-hole injection, for a GaAs/AlGaAs sample with Œî = 0.32 eV (equivalent to 3.9 ¬µm in wavelength). ( Nature Photonics 8, 412-418, (2014). * Physics of internal Photoemission: The temperature- dependent characteristic of band offsets at the heterojunction interface was studied by an internal photoemission (IPE) method. In contrast to the traditional Fowler method independent of the temperature (T), this method takes into account carrier thermalization and carrier/dopant-induced band- renormalization and band-tailing effects, and thus measures the band-offset parameter at different temperatures. Re-examining a p-type doped GaAs emitter/undoped AlxGa1‚àíxAs barrier heterojunction system disclosed its previously ignored T dependency in the valence-band offset, with a variation up to ‚àº‚àí10‚àí4 eV/K in order to accommodate the difference in the T -dependent band gaps between GaAs and AlGaAs. Through determining the Fermi energy level (Ef ), IPE is able to distinguish the impurity (IB) and valence bands (VB) of extrinsic semiconductors. One important example is to determine Ef of dilute magnetic semiconductors such as GaMnAs, and to understand whether it is in the IB or VB. ()PRB 86 195315 (2012) We also employed IPE spectroscopy to directly measure the valence-band Van Hove singularity, and identify phonons participating in indirect intervalence-band optical transitions. Photoemission of holes photoexcited through transitions between valence bands displays a clear and resolvable threshold, unlike previous reports of interband critical points, which become obscure in doped materials. We demonstrated the enhancement of optical phonon-assisted features primarily contributing to the photoemission yield. (PRB 88, 201302 (2013). We also reported the non- commutativity of band offset for GaAs/AlGaAs, i.e., the dependence on the order of the growth of the layers by probing a slightly higher (5‚Äì10 meV) valence-band offset at the GaAs-on-Al0.57Ga0.43As interface compared to that of the Al0.57Ga0.43As-on-GaAs interface, by using internal photoemission spectroscopy. IPE Spectroscopy was also applied to other materials such as HgCdTE (APL 104, 131106 (2014), type-II InAs/GaSb superlattice (T2SL) pBp photodetector (APL 103, 181110 (2013), GaAs and GaMnAs, GaAsSb, InGaAs (JAP 119, 105304 (2016) * Minimally Invasive Disease Diagnostics: Activation of Jurkat T-cells in culture following treatment with anti-CD3 (Cluster of Differentiation 3) antibody was detected was detected within 75 min after the cells encountered specific immunoglobulin molecules by interrogating the treated T-cells using the Attenuated Total Reflection‚ÄìFourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy technique. (APL 104, 243705 (2014). A rapid, simple, cost effective and minimally invasive technique, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, was demonstrated as an effective tool to detect colitis in mice blood serum.(J. Biophotonics 10, 465 (2017). ) The same technique was extended to demonstrate the identification of biochemical changes induced by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and subcutaneous melanoma using EL4 mouse model of non- Hodgkin lymphoma and a B16 mouse model of subcutaneous melanoma.

Possible causes The timing led to suspicion that it was related to the holiday fireworks, although the owner of the grocery store where the fire began speculated that it was started by Indians in revenge for a white man beating an Indian woman. A contemporary news account claimed local citizens found red cards with \\"You have no pity ‚Äì we show no mercy\\" written on them in their yards the next morning. The director of the Kittitas County Historical Museum says the list of possible causes for the fire includes \\"errant fireworks, insurance fraud, faulty electric lights, striking miners, vagrants displaced by the Seattle fire, disgruntled Native Americans, disgruntled Chinese, even a disgruntled circus that had tried and failed to set up their tent on the edge of town in the high winds that were blowing that day.\\" References Category:1889 in Washington (state) Category:1889 fires Category:1889 disasters in the United States Category:Fires in Washington (state) ","title":"Great Ellensburg Fire"},{"id":"61420614","text":"The Elman W. Campbell Museum is a museum in Newmarket, Ontario. Beginning with the first Quaker settlers in the early 1800s, the museum covers the history of Newmarket and the surrounding area, with a focus on local artifacts and their significance. It has several permanent exhibits, as well as space for temporary exhibits. Also available are community group programs for elementary school students and groups such as Scouts Canada. The museum is located at 134 Main Street South and is wheelchair accessible. Exhibits The museum features several permanent exhibits including: * A model railroad depicting downtown Newmarket in the mid 1920s * A replica log cabin setting depicting the life of the early pioneers who lived in the Newmarket area Temporary exhibits have included: * 75th Anniversary of D-Day: Featuring photographs and uniforms of the period * The Great War in Pictures and Objects: Exhibiting pictures, uniforms and artifacts dating from 1914-1918 * Gallery of Festive Trees: Presenting a variety of Christmas trees decorated in the styles of various time periods * History Through Stitches: A collection of handmade quilts by several branches of the Federated Women's Institutes of Ontario along with items from the museum's collection of sewing machines and tools * The annual Scout Display: Presenting the museum's collecting of Scouting memorabilia Founder Born on April 11, 1905, south of Mount Albert, Ontario, Elman W. Campbell attended Newmarket High School and afterwards studied chemical engineering at the University of Toronto. Campbell was blinded by a series of accidents in 1928. He owned the Campbell Stationery and China Shop at 189 Main Street from 1934 to 1974 and gathered many of the early artifacts for the museum. He was also responsible for the establishment of the museum in 1981 with the help of Ray Twinney, mayor of Newmarket at the time. From 1978 to 1982, Elman Campbell served as the president of the Newmarket Historical Society. Current and former buildings When it originally opened in 1982, the museum was located on the top floor of the Old Fire Hall at 140 Main Street South. In October 1990, the museum was moved to 543 Timothy Street in order to take advantage of the greater floor space and available parking. Since 1996, the museum has been housed in the former North York Registry Office, built in 1884. Built in the Classical Revival style, the building was designated in 1987 under the Ontario Heritage Act for its historical and architectural significance. It served as the regional registry office from its construction until 1980, when the records were moved to the recently built Provincial Court Building at 50 Eagle Street West. The building was then used as the location for the administrative offices of York Region until they were moved to the York Region Administrative Centre in 1993. The museum shares the building with the Newmarket Historical Society Archives as well as Heritage Newmarket.

History The four L class tank locomotives that were purchased from Beyer, Peacock and Company for the South Australian Railways in 1880 were meant to work on the Port line. There was a problem straight away with the new locomotives, they were found to have an axle load which was too high for the track and bridges that they would run over. To solve this problem the S.A.R. went and purchased four six wheeled tenders from D√ºbs and Company, Scotland and removed the side water tanks to bring the axle load down to a more acceptable level. With the L class entering service as tender locomotives they were put to work on the northern lines, as far as Riverton and heading further north once heavier track was laid up to Terowie. The L class also worked Kapunda and on the Adelaide to Nairne section of the \\"Intercolonial Railway\\". Later in life the L class worked in the eastern area of Murray Bridge, which included mixed trains to Pinnaroo. When S.A.R. commissioner William Alfred Webb's famous \\"Big Power\\" locomotives arrived in 1926, this put the now smaller L class locomotives to limited work. This eventually resulted in the withdrawal and scrapping of these 4-4-0 locomotives.

CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday Game of the Week. It was one of the largest agreements (to date) between the sport of baseball and the business of broadcasting. On January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (Sunday, Wednesday Night Baseball, doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays, plus holidays). The deal with CBS was also supposed to pay each team $10 million a year. A separate deal with cable TV would bring each team an additional $4 million. Each team could also cut its own deal with local TV. For example, the New York Yankees signed with a cable network (MSG) that would pay the team $41 million annually for 12 years. Radio broadcast rights can bring in additional money. Reportedly, after the huge TV contracts with CBS and ESPN were signed, ballclubs spent their excess millions on free agents. In the end, CBS wound up losing approximately half a billion dollars from their television contract with Major League Baseball. CBS repeatedly asked Major League Baseball for a rebate, but MLB wasn't willing to do this. Year-by- year breakdown =1990= As previously mentioned, on January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (Sunday Night Baseball, Wednesday Night Baseball and doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays), as well as multiple games on Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. On April 15, 1990, ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball debuted with the experienced play-by-play announcer Jon Miller joining retired Hall of Fame player Joe Morgan in the broadcast booth. In its first year, Sunday Night Baseball averaged a 3.0 rating. That was double the number that ESPN as a whole was averaging at the time (1.5). By 1998, ESPN enjoyed its largest baseball audience ever (a 9.5 Nielsen rating) as Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run of the season. When ESPN first broadcast Sunday Night Baseball, they would show at least one game from every ballpark. Also, every team was guaranteed an appearance. It was essentially, the television equivalent to a cross country stadium tour. Meanwhile, Major League Baseball's four-season tenure with CBS (‚Äì) was marred by turmoil and shortcomings throughout. The original plan was for Brent Musburger to be the primary play-by-play announcer for CBS' baseball telecasts (thus, having the tasks of calling the All-Star Game, National League Championship Series and World Series), with veteran broadcaster and lead CBS Radio baseball voice Jack Buck to serve as the secondary announcer (which would involve calling a second weekly game and the American League Championship Series). Former ABC color commentator Tim McCarver was hired by CBS to be Musburger's partner while NBC's Jim Kaat was hired to be Buck's. However, weeks before CBS was to debut its MLB coverage, on April 1, 1990, Musburger was fired by the network over what CBS perceived to be a power grab by Musburger in taking on the assignment (at the time, Musburger was CBS' lead college basketball announcer, host of The NFL Today, and was the main studio host for the NBA and had felt that he had been given too many broadcasting assignments by the network). With Musburger's firing, Buck was moved up to the primary announcing team alongside McCarver. His position as backup announcer alongside Kaat was taken by CBS' lead NBA announcer, Dick Stockton. Studio host Greg Gumbel took over for Stockton as the secondary play-by-play announcer in . Gumbel was in return, replaced by Andrea Joyce, who served as a field reporter for the first three seasons of CBS' coverage. On the teaming of Buck and McCarver, Broadcasting magazine wrote \\"The network has exclusivity, much rides on them.\\" Joining the team of Buck and McCarver was Lesley Visser (who was, incidentally, married to the aforementioned Dick Stockton), became the first woman to cover the World Series in 1990. CBS initially did not want to start their 1990 coverage until after the network had aired that year's NBA Finals (which was the last time CBS aired the Finals before the NBA's move to NBC). Therefore, only 12 regular season telecasts were scheduled The broadcasts would have been each Saturday from June 16 through August 25 and a special Sunday telecast on the weekend of August 11‚Äì12 (the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland on both days). Ultimately, four more telecasts were added ‚Äì two in April and two on the last two Saturdays of the season. Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned rave reviews for his role as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a considerable \\"good-guy air\\"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, \\"This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [on commentary].\\" Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would \\"force\\" something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said \\"Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important.\\" A mildly notorious moment came during CBS' coverage of the 1990 All-Star Game from Wrigley Field in Chicago. In a game that was marred by rain delays for a combined 85 minutes (including a 68-minute monsoon during the 7th inning), CBS annoyed many diehard fans by airing the William Shatner-hosted reality series Rescue 911 during the delay. The 1990 postseason started on a Thursday, while World Series started on a Tuesday due to the brief lockout. Major League Baseball and CBS went with some rather unconventional scheduling during the LCS round, with two consecutive scheduled off-days in the NLCS after Game 2. After NBC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, the network aggressively counterprogrammed CBS' postseason baseball coverage with made- for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers. CBS' first year of Major League Baseball postseason coverage in general, proved to be problematic for the network. First and foremost, none of the teams involved in the ALCS (Boston and Oakland), NLCS (Cincinnati and Pittsburgh), and World Series (Cincinnati and Oakland) involved teams from baseball's largest media markets. This more than likely, helped reduce playoff ratings by 9.4% for prime time games and 3.4% for weekend daytime games. This was below the levels of the playoffs the year before, when they aired on NBC. While the ratings for the 1990 World Series improved to 26.2 compared to 1989, the 1989 Series (which aired on ABC) was interrupted for 10 days by the Loma Prieta earthquake. All in all, the 1989 World Series was at the time, the lowest rated World Series ever. More to the point, the ratings for the 1990 World Series on CBS were significantly lower than any World Series between 1982 and 1988. Although the 1990 NLCS lasted six games, that year's ALCS and more importantly, the World Series, lasted only four out of seven possible games. To put things into proper perspective, by one estimate, CBS lost $5 million for each playoff game not played and US$15.4 million for each World Series game not played. At the end of the day, CBS lost $12 million to $15 million on each of the League Championship Series and World Series games not played, for a total of $36 million to $45 million. =1991= After sustaining huge losses (CBS claimed to have lost about $55 million in after-taxes revenue in 1990, which would go up to $170 million at the end of its four-year contract) from 1990's abbreviated postseason (which ended with the Cincinnati Reds shockingly sweeping the defending World Champion Oakland Athletics in the World Series), CBS made several notable adjustments for 1991. Regular season telecasts were reduced to a meager handful. In return, pregame shows during the League Championship Series were entirely eliminated, to minimize the ratings damage. For CBS' coverage of the 1991 All-Star Game from Toronto, CBS started their broadcast at the top of the hour with the customary pregame coverage. And then, because American President George H.W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney were throwing out the first ball, there was a slight delay from the 8:30 p.m. EDT start. The game eventually started about 15‚Äì20 minutes late. Presumably this, along with CBS' low ratings for baseball, and the costs of doing pregame coverage, led to them starting the prime time broadcasts at 8:30 for the final two years of the contract, with little or no pregame content. The 1991 season was perhaps most noteworthy for CBS having the opportunity to cover the now legendary World Series between the Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves. The tightly contested, seven-game affair between Minnesota and Atlanta earned CBS the highest ratings for a World Series since the 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox on NBC. Earlier in the postseason, CBS' coverage of the ALCS meant that they could not carry the live testimony of Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation to the United States Supreme Court was put into question because of charges of sexual harassment from former staffer Anita Hill. Meanwhile, ABC, NBC, CNN and PBS all carried the testimony. As previously mentioned, as CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped its 8:00 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing sitcoms such as Evening Shade), before finally starting their coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m. Perhaps as a result, Joe Carter's World Series clinching home run off Mitch Williams in 1993, occurred at 12:00 a.m. on the East Coast. After two years of calling baseball telecasts for CBS, Jack Buck was dismissed in December 1991. According to the radio veteran Buck, he had a hard time adjusting to the demands of a more constricting television production. CBS felt that Buck should have done more to make himself appear to be a set-up man for lead analyst Tim McCarver. Jack Buck's son Joe tried to rationalize his father's on-air problems by saying \\"My dad was brought up in the golden age of radio, I think he had his hands tied somewhat, being accustomed to the freedom of radio. I'm more used to acquiescing to what the producer wants to do, what the director wants to do.\\" Buck himself sized up CBS' handling of the announcers by saying \\"CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word- pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [analyst Tim] McCarver run the show.' In television, all they want you to do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up.\\" Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of \\"trying to predict plays, as if to prove he was still on top.\\" Buck also got into deep trouble with CBS executives (namely executive producer Ted Shaker) over questionable comments made towards singer Bobby Vinton in 1990. While on-air prior to Game 4 of that year's NLCS in Pittsburgh, Buck criticized Vinton's off-key rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", making a comment towards Vinton that sounded like a prejudicial remark centered on his Polish heritage. Joe Buck believed that the situation was ironic because his father was \\"trying to help the guy.\\" Buck began receiving death threats from Pirate fans and discovered a footprint on his pillow once he returned to his hotel room. =1992= Jack Buck's replacement was Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Ted Shaker called McDonough about his interests for the top announcing job, and after McDonough hung up the telephone, he claimed that he did not want to \\"act like a 10-year- old\\" but he \\"jumped so high that he put a hole in his ceiling.\\" McDonough, who was 30 years old at the time, became the youngest full-time network announcer to call a World Series when he called that year's Fall Classic alongside McCarver. For CBS' coverage of the 1992 All-Star Game, they introduced Basecam, a lipstick-size camera, inside first base. The 1992 All-Star Game on CBS was also interrupted with coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Over the course of Game 2 of the 1992 ALCS, Jim Kaat was stricken with a bad case of laryngitis. As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and finish the game with Dick Stockton as a \\"relief analyst.\\" There was talk that if Kaat's laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going to replace Kaat on television for Game 3, while Bench would continue to work on CBS Radio. Tim McCarver ran afoul of Atlanta Braves outfielder Deion Sanders during the 1992 postseason, when he made comments on-air criticizing Sanders for his two-sport athletic career; Sanders was playing for both the Braves and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons at the time and participated in both the baseball postseason and the early NFL regular season for the first time in 1992 (Sanders was unable to do this in 1991, as his NFL contract with the Falcons would not allow him to). Sanders retaliated following Game 7 of the NLCS by dumping a bucket of ice water on McCarver (who was wired for sound and feared electrocution). McCarver was not immune to criticism from outside sources, either, as Norman Chad wrote a critique of him in Sports Illustrated during the postseason. Chad said that McCarver was someone who \\"when you ask him the time, will tell you how a watch works\\", a reference to McCarver's perceived tendency to overanalyze things. Chad went further by saying \\"What's the difference between Tim McCarver and appendicitis? Appendicitis is covered by most health plans.\\" McCarver was also known to make gaffes from time to time. One of his more amusing miscues came during the 1992 National League Championship Series when he repeatedly referred to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Tim Wakefield as \\"Bill Wakefield.\\" He finally explained that Bill Wakefield was one of his old minor-league teammates, and he laughed at himself because \\"I forgot my own name!\\" The year prior, during Game 6 of the World Series, McCarver's broadcast colleague, Jack Buck talked about Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton, who hit .367 in the series. Buck said, \\"TP. That's what his teammates call him.\\" A few seconds later, McCarver rather oddly added, \\"TP. An appropriate name for someone who plays on the Braves.\\" During the 1992 postseason, CBS missed covering one of the three debates among U.S. presidential candidates George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and H. Ross Perot. The network had planned to join other broadcast and cable networks in the telecast; however, Game 4 of the ALCS between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics did not end until 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time, about the time the debate ended. The Blue Jays won the game 7-6 in 11 innings. The other networks reported very good ratings for the debate, part of one of the more compelling election campaigns in recent times. =1993= Lesley Visser missed the first half of the 1993 season due to injuries earlier suffered in a bizarre jogging accident in New York City's Central Park. Visser broke her hip and skidded face-first across the pavement, requiring reconstructive plastic surgery on her face and more than a decade later required an artificial hip replacement. She missed the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Jim Kaat would replace her while she recuperated. Jim Gray also served as a reporter for the All-Star Game and World Series. For 1993, CBS made a broadcast booth change by removing Dick Stockton from his role as secondary play-by-play announcer after three seasons, and replacing him with Greg Gumbel. As previously mentioned, also during the 1993 season, Andrea Joyce replaced Gumbel as studio host. Joyce would be joined at the anchor desk by Pat O'Brien. At the 1993 World Series, she became the first woman to co-host the network television coverage for a World Series. Sean McDonough filled in for O'Brien, who was suffering from laryngitis, as the pregame host for Game 6 of the 1993 National League Championship Series. Game 6 of the NLCS by the way, didn't have its first pitch until nearly 8:50 p.m. EST so that CBS could run 60 Minutes in its entirety. On August 3, 1993, Gayle Gardner became the first woman to do television play-by-play for a Major League Baseball game. It was the Colorado Rockies vs. Cincinnati Reds on KWGN-TV in Denver. During CBS' coverage of the World Series, umpires were upset with the overhead replays being televised by CBS. Dave Phillips, the crew chief, said just prior to Game 2 that the umpires want \\"CBS to be fair with their approach.\\" Rick Gentile, senior vice president for production for CBS Sports, said that Richie Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association, tried to call the broadcast booth during Saturday's game, but the call was not put through. Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the Philadelphia Phillies' Ricky Jordan out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6 inches outside. National League President Bill White, while using a CBS headset in the broadcast booth during Game 1, was overheard telling Gentile and the producer Bob Dekas, \\"You guys keep using that camera the way you want. Don't let Phillips intimidate you.\\" The final Major League Baseball game that CBS has televised to date was Game 6 of the 1993 World Series on October 23. Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period, as well as advertising revenues in excess of $150 million a season. =1994= In , ESPN renewed its baseball contract for six years (through the season). The new deal was worth $42.5 million per year and $255 million overall. The deal was ultimately voided after the season and ESPN was pretty much forced to restructure their contract. After the fall-out from CBS's financial problems from their exclusive, four-year-long, US$1.8 billion television contract with Major League Baseball (a contract that ultimately cost the network approximately $500 million), Major League Baseball decided to go into the business of producing the telecasts themselves and market these to advertisers on its own. In reaction to the failed trial with CBS, Major League Baseball was desperately grasping for every available dollar. To put things into proper perspective, in 1991, the second year of the league's contract with the network, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in the third quarter of the year. A decline in advertiser interest caused revenue from the sale of commercials during CBS's baseball telecasts to plummet. All the while, CBS was still contractually obligated to pay Major League Baseball around $260 million a year through 1993. Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period, as well as advertising revenues in excess of $150 million a season. As part of MLB's attempt to produce and market the games in-house, it hoped to provide games of regional interests to appropriate markets. Major League Baseball in the process, hoped to offer important games for divisional races to the overall market. Owners also hoped that this particular technique, combined with the additional division races created through league expansion (the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins had begun play the year prior) and the quest for wild card spots for the playoffs (1994 was the first year of three divisions for each league) would increase the national broadcast revenue for Major League Baseball in the foreseeable future. After a four-year hiatus, ABC and NBC (who last aired Thursday Night Baseball games and the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week respectively) returned to Major League Baseball under the umbrella of a revenue-sharing venture called The Baseball Network. Under a six-year plan (with an option for two additional years), Major League Baseball was intended to receive 85% of the first US$140 million in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales topped a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous TV deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers were reportedly excited about the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included several changes intended to boost ratings, especially among younger viewers. Arranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, to benefit NBC and ABC (who each contributed $10 million in start-up funds) since it gave them a monopoly on broadcasting Major League Baseball games. The deal was similar to a time-buy, instead of a traditional rights fee situation. It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright (in stark contrast to CBS's disastrous contract with Major League Baseball from the 1990‚Äì1993 seasons). NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment for each other and keep an emerging Fox, which had recently made an aggressive and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the television rights for National Football Conference games (thus, becoming a major player in the sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by affiliate changes, as a number of stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in Detroit, WWJ-TV replaced WJBK). The Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994 on NBC with the All-Star Game from Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The NBC broadcast team consisted of Bob Costas on play- by-play, with Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker as analysts. Costas, a veteran presence at NBC, had been the network's secondary baseball play-by-play announcer behind Vin Scully during the 1980s. Morgan, who was also working for ESPN at the time, had spent two years at NBC in the mid-1980s and two years at ABC from 1988-1989. Uecker, the longtime voice of the Milwaukee Brewers, returned to national television for the first time since he worked for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s. Greg Gumbel hosted the pre game show; this was one of his first assignments for NBC after having left CBS Sports following the 1994 College World Series. Helping with interviews were Hannah Storm and Johnny Bench. The 1994 All-Star Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots. This was considered an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost US$300,000. The '94 All-Star game also was broadcast in Spanish on NBC's Secondary Audio Program. Boston Red Sox announcer Hector Martinez and seven time All-Star Tony P√©rez were the announcers for the occasion. ABC, meanwhile, was able to have its primary broadcast team from 1989 return intact. Al Michaels served as the play-by-play announcer once again. Tim McCarver, who had just spent four years at CBS, returned as an analyst along with Jim Palmer. On the subject of Michaels returning to baseball for the first time since the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake interrupted the 1989 World Series, Jim Palmer said, \\"Here Al is, having done five games since 1989, and steps right in. It's hard to comprehend how one guy could so amaze.\\" After the All-Star Game was complete, ABC took over coverage with what was to be their weekly slate of games. ABC was scheduled to televise six regular season games on Saturdays or Mondays in prime time. NBC would then pick up where ABC left off by televising six more regular season Friday night games. Every Baseball Night in America game was scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time if the game occurred on the West Coast). A single starting time gave the networks the opportunity to broadcast one game and then, simultaneously, cut to another game when there was a break in action. The networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service (such as ESPN or superstations like Chicago's WGN-TV or Atlanta's WTBS) or over-the-air broadcaster was allowed to telecast a Major League Baseball game on those dates. Baseball Night in America (which premiered on July 16, 1994) usually aired up to fourteen games based on the viewers' region (affiliates chose games of local interest to carry) as opposed to a traditional coast-to-coast format. Normally, announcers who represented each of the teams playing in the respective games were paired with each other. More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-\\"national\\" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together. Games involving either of the two Canadian-based MLB teams at the time, the Toronto Blue Jays and Montreal Expos, were not always included in the Baseball Night in America package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast the games. When TSN (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the BNIA feed across their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos would be featured on TSN. Also, CBET (the CBC affiliate in Windsor, Ontario) would air Blue Jays games if the Detroit Tigers were not playing at home that night or if the Blue Jays were scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team. In even- numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC would have the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate. When ABC and NBC last covered baseball together from 1976 to 1989, ABC had the rights to the World Series in odd-numbered years while NBC would cover the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in said years. Likewise, this process would alternate in even numbered years, with ABC getting the All-Star Game and both LCS in years that NBC had the World Series. The long-term plans for The Baseball Network began to crumble after players and owners went on strike on August 12, 1994. In addition to the cancellation of that year's World Series, ABC was denied its remaining Baseball Night in America telecasts and NBC was shut out of its game broadcast slate (which in 1994, was scheduled to begin on August 26) altogether. Both networks elected to dissolve the partnership with Major League Baseball on June 22, 1995. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. It should also be noted that under the terms of the agreement, it could be voided by any party if the venture did not produce a minimum of $330 million in revenue over the first two years. Shortly after the start of the strike, Stanford University's Roger Noll argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement ESPN cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected \\"poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters.\\" He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by \\"one-third to one-half\\" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of Baseball and Billions, and a players' union consulting economist, insisted that baseball could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of CBS (which offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), Fox and TBS. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out.\\" =1995= In , ESPN broadcast the American League West tie-breaker game between the Seattle Mariners and California Angels with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan making the call. The networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend broadcasts after 7:20 p.m. Eastern Time. When CBS held the television rights, postseason games routinely aired on the East Coast at 8:30 p.m. at the earliest. This meant that Joe Carter's dramatic World Series clinching home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8:00 p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing sitcoms such as Evening Shade) before finally starting its coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m. ABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss by calling \\"heads.\\" Ken Schanzer, who was the CEO of The Baseball Network, handled the coin toss. Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they would divide up the playoffs. What separated The Baseball Network from previous television deals with Major League Baseball, and was by far the most controversial part of the deal, was that not all postseason games (aside from the World Series) were guaranteed to be shown nationally. To increase viewership by preventing games from being played in the afternoon (the league was the only professional sports league in the country to play postseason games during the afternoon), the National League and American League's division and championship series games were instead played simultaneously in primetime, and affiliates could only air one game each night, which were again determined regionally. If one playoff series had already concluded, the remaining games would be aired nationally. Despite the frustration of not being able to see both League Championship Series on a national level, the 1995 LCS averaged a 13.1 rating. A major problem with Baseball Night in America was the idea that viewers could not watch \\"important\\" games. Marty Noble put it in perspective by saying \\"With the Network determining when games will begin and which games are made available to which TV markets, Major League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy.\\" What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that Baseball Night in America held exclusivity over every market. This most severely impacted markets with two teams, specifically New York City (Mets and Yankees), the Greater Los Angeles Area (Dodgers and Angels), Chicago (Cubs and White Sox), the San Francisco Bay Area (Giants and A's), and even Texas (Astros and Rangers). For example, if Baseball Night in America showed a Yankees game, this meant that nobody in New York could see that night's Mets game and vice versa. Things got so bad for The Baseball Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. KSMO-TV in Kansas City, the primary over-the-air station for the Kansas City Royals, went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being \\"overexposed\\" and violating its territorial exclusivity. Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate for the time zone. For example, if the Detroit Tigers (the only team in their market) played a road game in Seattle, Oakland or Anaheim beginning at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time (a late game), Detroit's Baseball Network affiliate (either WXYZ-TV or WDIV, depending on the network which held the rights to the game) could not air the game because the start time was too late for the Detroit area (11:00 p.m. Eastern Time). Detroit viewers only had the option of viewing the early game of the night. Sports Illustrated columnist Tom Verducci for one, was very harsh on The Baseball Network, dubbing it both \\"America's regional pastime\\" and an \\"abomination.\\" ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson, in announcing the dissolution of The Baseball Network, said \\"The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in Washington, with the advertising community here in Manhattan, or with its TV partners.\\" Five years after The Baseball Network dissolved, NBC Sports play-by-play announcer Bob Costas wrote in his book Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball that The Baseball Network was \\"stupid and an abomination.\\" Costas further wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. He believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game and acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented from watching many of the playoff games that they wanted to see, as all playoff games had been broadcast nationally for decades. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a Big Ten football game between Wisconsin and Michigan. According to Curt Smith's book, The Voice ‚Äì Mel Allen's Untold Story, the longtime New York Yankees broadcaster and This Week in Baseball host was quoted as saying \\"You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS]. What kind of show cancels a twenty- six-week-season's first fourteen weeks?\\" (in response to TBN's tagline, \\"Welcome to the Show\\"). During the 1995 Division Series, the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere mention of it during the Mariners‚ÄìYankees ALDS from public address announcer Tom Hutyler at Seattle's Kingdome brought boos from most of the crowd. To further put things into perspective, 55% of the country was able to get the American League Championship Series (Cleveland-Seattle) while 45% got the National League Championship Series (Atlanta-Cincinnati) for at least the first two games on ABC. The Baseball Network's contract stipulated that negotiations could only take place with NBC and ABC for 45 days, starting on August 15, 1995. But with NBC and ABC's refusal to continue after the 1995 season, baseball had to look at its future options. In October 1995, when it was a known fact that ABC and NBC were going to end their television deal/joint venture with Major League Baseball, preliminary talks rose about CBS returning. It was rumored that CBS would show Thursday night games (more specifically, a package of West Coast interleague games scheduled for the 11:30 Eastern/8:30 Pacific Time slot) while Fox would show Saturday afternoon games. CBS and Fox were also rumored to share rights to the postseason. In the end however, CBS's involvement did not come to pass and NBC became Fox's over-the-air national television partner. Whereas each team earned about $14 million in 1990 under CBS the later TV agreement with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996 earned each team about $6.8 million. To salvage the remains of the partnership, ABC and NBC elected to share coverage of the 1995 postseason including the World Series. ABC wound up broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 of 1995 World Series while NBC would broadcast Games 2, 3, and 6 (which turned out to be the decisive game). Had the 1995 World Series gone to a seventh game, it would have then been broadcast by ABC. As it stands, Game 5 of the 1995 World Series is to date, the final Major League Baseball game to be broadcast on ABC. During the 1995 World Series, NBC's Hannah Storm was the first woman to serve as solo host of a World Series, and the first to preside over a World Series trophy presentation. Others would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the National Football League's television package, which focuses on localized games, with one or two \\"national\\" games. In the end, the venture would lose US$95 million in advertising and nearly $500 million in national and local spending. The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 on average in 1995. Both ABC and NBC soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century, and Fox signed on to be the exclusive network carrier of Major League Baseball regular season games in 1996. However, NBC kept a postseason-only (with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the All- Star Game) deal in the end, signing a deal to carry three Division Series games, one half of the League Championship Series (the ALCS in even numbered years and the NLCS in odd numbered years; Fox would televise the other LCS in said years), and the 1997 and 1999 World Series respectively (Fox had exclusive rights to the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series). Beginning in 2001, Fox would become the exclusive broadcast network for the World Series. =1996= In , ESPN began a five-year contract with Major League Baseball worth $440 million and about $80 million per year. ESPN paid for the rights to a Wednesday night doubleheader and Sunday Night Baseball, as well as Opening Day and holiday telecasts and all postseason games not aired on Fox or NBC. Major League Baseball staggered the times of first-round games to provide a full-day feast for viewers: ESPN could air games at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m. EDT, with the broadcast networks telecasting the prime time game. On November 7, 1995, Major League Baseball reached a television deal with Fox and NBC, allowing the former to obtain MLB game rights (assuming ABC's end of the contract). Fox paid $575 million for the five-year contract, a fraction less of the amount of money that CBS had paid for the Major League Baseball television rights for the 1990‚Äì1993 seasons. Unlike the previous television deal, \\"The Baseball Network\\" (a partnership created through the league's joint contract with ABC and NBC that began in the 1994 season), Fox reverted to the format of televising regular season games (approximately 16 weekly telecasts that normally began on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons. Fox did, however, continue a format that The Baseball Network started by offering a selection of games based purely on a viewer's region. Fox's approach has usually been to offer three regionalized telecasts. The initial deal also gave Fox the rights to broadcast the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series, the 1997 and 1999 All-Star Games, as well as coverage of the League Championship Series (shared with NBC) and five Division Series games each year. When Fox first began carrying baseball, it used the motto \\"Same game, new attitude.\\" to promote the telecasts, which had previously been used to promote the network's National Football League coverage when it began in 1994. Fox's primary goal when it first began airing Major League Baseball games was to promote their weak prime time schedule (which at the time included only a handful of hits, such as established series Beverly Hills 90210, The Simpsons and Married... with Children). Fox Sports president Ed Goren said, \\"We'll use the World Series and League Championship Series to spur our shows\\". Like its predecessor NBC, Fox determined its Saturday schedule by which MLB franchise was playing a team from one of the three largest television markets ‚Äì New York City, Los Angeles or Chicago. If there was a game which featured teams from two of these three markets (involving any combination of the Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, Angels, Cubs or White Sox), that game would be aired on the network. For its first year of coverage in 1996, Fox used the scoring bug on their Major League Baseball telecasts. Within two years, the bug would be expanded to all sports telecasts on Fox and other networks. The first scoring bug was a translucent parallelogram with red borders on the left and right. The Fox logo and inning were on the left side, with the score on the right side. The count and number of outs were underneath. A diamond would be displayed around the bug only when runners were on base. An occupied base was represented by a red dot. As previously mentioned, despite of the failure of The Baseball Network, NBC decided to retain its relationship with Major League Baseball, but on a far more restricted basis. Under the five-year deal signed on November 7, 1995 (running from the 1996 to 2000 seasons) for a total of approximately $400 million, NBC did not televise any regular season games. Instead, NBC only handled the All-Star Game, three Division Series games (on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights), and the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and the World Series, three Division Series games (also on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights) and the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years. Fox, which assumed ABC's portion of the league broadcast television rights, gained the rights to the Saturday Game of the Week during the regular season, in addition to alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series (the ALCS in odd-numbered years and the NLCS in even-numbered years), Division Series and the World Series. From -, NBC aired LDS games on Tuesday/Friday/Saturday nights. Fox aired LDS games on Wednesday/Thursday nights, Saturdays in the late afternoon, plus Sunday/Monday nights (if necessary). Meanwhile, ESPN carried many afternoon LDS contests. At this point, all playoff games were nationally televised (mostly in unopposed timeslots). Also around this particular period, NBC adapted composer Randy Edelman's theme from the short-lived Fox series The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. as the main theme music for its baseball telecasts. However, NBC used Edelman's \\"Emotions Run High\\" from the film The Big Green as the theme for the network's coverage of the 1996 All-Star Game. From 1996 to 2002, and since 2010-2014, MLB International broadcasts the League Championship Series alternately, with the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years. All World Series games from 1981 to 1996 were televised in Canada on CTV, using the feed from the US network broadcaster. The Atlanta Braves became the first Major League Baseball team to appear in World Series broadcast on all four major networks (NBC in 1957-58 and 1995, ABC in 1995, CBS in 1991-92 and Fox in 1996. The Philadelphia Phillies have since duplicated this feat (NBC in 1950 and 1980, ABC in 1983, CBS in 1993 and Fox in 2008-09). For Game 2 of the 1996 World Series (rescheduled to Monday night due to a rainout), Fox used an early start (7 p.m. Eastern Time) to minimize the overlap with Monday Night Football on ABC. =1997= On July 8, 1997, Fox televised its first ever All- Star Game (out of Jacobs Field in Cleveland). For this particular game, Fox introduced \\"Catcher-Cam\\" in which a camera was affixed to the catchers' masks in order to provide unique perspectives of the action around home plate. Catcher-Cam soon would become a regular fixture on Fox's baseball broadcasts. Also in 1997, just before the start of NBC's coverage of the World Series, Don Ohlmeyer, president of the network's West Coast entertainment division and former executive producer for NBC Sports, came under fire after publicly announcing that he hoped that the World Series would end in a four-game sweep. Ohlmeyer believed that baseball now lacked broad audience appeal (especially in the aftermath of the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike). As opposed to teams from the three largest television markets (New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) in the U.S., the 1997 World Series featured the matchup of the upstart Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, which made their second World Series appearance in three years. In addition, Ohlmeyer feared that the World Series would disrupt NBC's efforts to attract enough viewers for its new fall roster in order to stay on top of the ratings heap. Ohlmeyer said \\"If the A&E; channel called, I'd take the call.\\" Game 5 fell on a Thursday, which had long been the highest rated night on NBC's schedule, if not on all of television. Game 7 of the 1997 World Series caused a scheduled Chicago Bears- Miami Dolphins game to be postponed to Monday night. It was seen on ABC in the Chicago and Miami markets, and was intended to air on Fox. The rest of the nation received the scheduled Green Bay Packers-New England Patriots game, the only time a rematch of a previous season's Super Bowl aired on ABC. =1998= Fox's scoring bug was slightly modified in 1998. The layout remained the same but it now was a square. The teams and scores also now had a white background, with a red arrow indicating which team was at bat. Occupied bases were now represented by a yellow triangle. Also beginning in 1998, pitch speed began to briefly cover the count and outs area after a pitch was thrown. In 1998, Bob Uecker abruptly left NBC Sports before a chance to call the All-Star Game from Coors Field in Colorado. Uecker underwent a back operation in which four discs were replaced. For the remainder of the contract (1998‚Äì2000), only Bob Costas and Joe Morgan called the games. Also in 1998, NBC's coverage of the ALCS was the highest rated for any League Championship Series since before the 1994 strike. NBC averaged a 9.4 rating for the six games, which was a 6% increase than the network's coverage of the 1997 NLCS in the same time slot. The rating was 13% more than Fox's ALCS coverage in 1997 and 12% more than NBC's coverage in 1996. Also in , ESPN broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were on the call. =1999= In 1999, Fox unveiled a new scoring bug that was nearly identical to the NFL bug unveiled the previous fall. A permanent baserunner graphic (with a design that would be used through 2008) was on the left side of the bug and occupied bases would light up in yellow. The team scores were on a black background on the right side of the bug. A bar with the Fox logo and the inning (now with a standard up or down arrow to indicate top or bottom of the inning) extended from the top. A bar with the count and the number of outs extended from the bottom. Also in , Bob Costas teamed with his then-NBC colleague Joe Morgan to call two weekday night telecasts for ESPN. The first was on Wednesday, August 25 with Detroit Tigers playing against the Seattle Mariners. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the Atlanta Braves playing against the New York Mets. ESPN also broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game (this time between the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds) once again with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan once again on the call. The 1999 World Series was NBC's 39th and, to date, final World Series telecast. Fox would air the next World Series as part of the contract in place, and acquired the exclusive broadcast rights of Major League Baseball beginning in 2001. With the Knicks having played in the NBA Finals in June, this was the second championship series in 1999 that NBC broadcast involving teams from New York. Bob Costas, Jim Gray, and Hannah Storm were involved both times. Costas with play-by-play, Gray as a reporter, and Storm as pre-game host. Prior to Cleveland in 2016, this was the most recent year of a same city hosting both NBA Finals and World Series in the same year. During the World Series, NBC field reporter Jim Gray, who had previously covered Major League Baseball for CBS, came under fire for a confrontational interview with banned all-time hit king Pete Rose. Just prior to the start of Game 2 of the World Series, Gray pushed Rose ‚Äì on hand (by permission of Commissioner Bud Selig) at Turner Field in Atlanta as a fan-selected member of MasterCard's All- Century Team ‚Äì to admit to having wagered on baseball games as manager of the Cincinnati Reds ten years earlier. After NBC was flooded with tons of viewer complaints, Gray was forced to clarify his actions to the viewers at home prior to Game 3. Regardless of Gray's sincerity, Game 3 hero Chad Curtis of the New York Yankees boycotted Gray's request for an interview live on camera; Curtis had hit a game-winning home run to send the World Series 3‚Äì0 in the Yankees' favor. Curtis said to Gray, \\"Because of what happened with Pete, we decided not to say anything.\\" Despite the heavy criticism he received, Gray offered no apology for his line of questioning toward Rose: Although Dick Ebersol (then-president of NBC Sports) and Keith Olbermann ‚Äì among others ‚Äì have maintained that Gray was simply doing his job, in 2004 Pete Rose would admit to betting on baseball (along with other sports) while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 and the former Register of the National Estate on 28 September 1982.  History  In 1854, a Militia Act was passed in South Australia, giving the Government the power to call out a force of 2000 volunteers. This early military force was based at the Mounted Police Barracks off Kintore Avenue in Adelaide. A military parade ground was located in the area now occupied by the north and east wings of the South Australian Museum. A permanent military force was authorised in 1878, and in 1884 a force of one officer and 20 men was raised. As early as 1889, the unification of Australia's colonial military forces was suggested. With the Federation of Australia, South Australia's defence force, along with the other colonial defence forces, was taken over by the Commonwealth. As the development of a Commonwealth public works department took some time, the responsibility for constructing and maintaining Commonwealth Government buildings in South Australia, specifically post offices, customs and defence buildings, was initially given to the South Australian Public Works Department. In 1912, a contract was let for the construction of a Military Headquarters at Keswick in South Australia for a cost of 21,990 pounds. Contracts were also let for the Royal Australian Field Artillery Barracks at 14,565 pounds and for stables, gun park, barn, farriers shop, gym, quartermasters store and sick horse bay for 12,999 pounds. The Headquarters Building was completed in 1913 and was the first substantial Commonwealth building to be constructed in South Australia. In 1940, an additional storey was constructed on the flat roof of the Headquarters Building. The architect for this work was W. H. Hanal. In 1969 the boiler house and toilet block on the western side of the building were removed. Keswick Barracks continues to be used for defence purposes.  Description  The Headquarters Building is a three-storey brick building in the Federation Academic Classical style is on the northern corner of the Keswick Barracks site. The facade features two large towers, placed at either end of the building, and a central section with a segmental pediment, containing a coat- of-arms. The towers and the central section feature stucco detailing that imitates rustication. A two-storey colonnade runs between the towers and the central section. The building is in good condition. It has been used as a military headquarters since completion and has therefore undergone few alterations. An extra floor was added in 1940, but this reflects the development of the army during WWII, and is therefore of significance. A boiler room and toilet block was removed in 1969. (1992)  Heritage listing  The Headquarters Building, Keswick Barracks, built in 1912-13, is significant as the first substantial Commonwealth building constructed in South Australia. It was built as part of a Commonwealth program to expand defence infrastructure following Federation and it has been used for defence purposes since it was completed. The Headquarters Building is a central building at Keswick Barracks, one of the first significant barracks to be established in Australia after the formation of the Australian Army. Keswick Barracks has remained the headquarters of the Army in South Australia. The Headquarters Building is important as a good example of an early twentieth- century purpose-built military headquarters. Constructed in the Federation Academic Classical style, the building demonstrates attitudes to the design and planning of military buildings in the Federation period.

He has been an archbishop and had the rank of nuncio since 1990. Biography Erwin Josef Ender was born on 7 September 1937 in Steingrund in Lower Silesia Province (now Kamienna, Poland). He spent his childhood there until the end of World War II when the region became part of Poland. The German population of Silesia was relocated and from 1945 on his family lived in L√ºdinghausen in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As a seminarian Ender studied philosophy and theology at the Westf√§lische Wilhelms-Universit√§t in M√ºnster and then at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Collegium Germanicum in Rome. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of M√ºnster on 10 October 1965. He received his doctorate from the Gregorian in 1970 with a thesis on the work of the work of John Henry Newman. He then entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 10 August 1970 and worked until 1990 in the offices of the Secretariat of State. On 15 March 1990, Pope John Paul II appointed him Titular Archbishop of Germania in Numidia and gave him two diplomatic assignments: Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Sudan and Apostolic Delegate to the Red Sea Region. On 5 April he received his episcopal consecration from the pope. On 26 March 1992 his title changed from Delegate to the Red Sea Region to Delegate to Somalia. In Sudan in 1996, he accused the government of torturing a priest to extract a false confession of planning anti-government sabotage. On 9 July 1997, John Paul named him Apostolic Nuncio to the Baltic States: Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. A month later, on 9 August, he was given the additional responsibility of Apostolic Administrator of Estonia. On 19 May 2001 he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to the Czech Republic. On 25 November 2003, he was named Apostolic Nuncio to the Federal Republic of Germany. On 15 October 2007, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Ender's resignation as Apostolic Nuncio in Germany and appointed Jean-Claude P√©risset as his successor. Pope Benedict named him a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 9 May 2009. On 2011 he led the delegation of the Holy See to a United Nations-sponsored conference in Moscow on discrimination and persecution of Christians.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. The Forest Service refers to this area as ‚ÄúBear Creek‚Äù, but the Wilderness Society prefers the name ‚ÄúCrawfish Valley‚Äù because the valley is larger and serves as a divide between Reed and Bear Creeks, two of the principal drainages in the area. The largest inventoried roadlesss area in the Jefferson Forest, the immense area includes a section of the Appalachian Trail and 24 miles of other trails making the area popular with hikers and horseback riders. Bounded by Walker Mountain on the north and Brushy and Little Brushy Mountain on the south, the area possesses the size and shape needed for making its preservation as a potential wilderness practical. The area is part of the Walker Mountain Cluster. Location and access Reed Creek Mill in Wytheville, VAThe area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, just east of Interstate 81 and about 7 miles west of Wytheville, Virginia. A 4.1 mile section of the Appalachian Trail crosses the southern end of the area. Hikers traveling south enter the area at Tilson Gap and leave at the crest of Brushy Mountain. The trail intersects with the Black Lick-Plaster Bank Turnpike 0.2 miles south of Tilson Gap. a turnpike used to carry gypsum (plaster) from Plaster Bank, where it was mined, to Black Lick for shipment. Gypsum was used as a fertilizer before being replaced by petroleum-based products. Continuing south, the trail passes the Crawfish Valley Trail and the Walker Mountain Trail, then reaches Reed Creek in the Crawfish Valley. Good campsites are found here. In another 1.1 miles the trail reaches the crest of Brushy Mountain where it intersects once again with the Crawfish Valley Trail, offering the possibility of a loop hike that combines this section of the AT with the Crawfish Valley Trail. The trail leaves the wild area at the crest of Brushy Mountain. The Appalachian Trail is closed to horses and mountain bikes, but a trail for horse and mountain bikes is nearby. Other trails into the area include: *Bear Creek Trail; Forest Trail 159; 3.5 miles; rated easy-moderate in difficulty; yellow blazed; hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. *Crawfish Trail; Forest Trail 6506; 10.0 miles, moderate-difficult; orange blazed; hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding *Walker Mountain Trail; Forest Trail 6501; 12.3 miles; moderate; yellow blazed; hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding *Ceres Trail; Forest Trail 804.1; 2.5 miles; moderate, no blazes, hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding The Ceres Turnpike, Forest Service Road 804.1, is an unimproved, 2.1 mile road now gated and managed as closed. Boundary of the Crawfish Valley wildland as identified by the Wilderness Society The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. The map can be enlarged by selecting the icon in the lower right of the image. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley, Trails Illustrated Hiking Maps, 787). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Crawfish Valley wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Nebo, Rural Retreat, Big Bend, and Garden Mountain. Natural history The area is part of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock, white pine and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. There are a few stands of table mountain pine, a tree that has become uncommon because it requires fire to reproduce. There are about 70 acres of wildlife opening and old fields, mostly along and above Reed Creek, maintained by prescribed burns and mowing. There are also two artificial waterholes for wildlife. Golden-winged Warbler, Tawas Point State Park, 17 May 2014 (14031168117)The area provides habitat for the golden-winged warbler, a species listed by the Department of Interior as a ‚ÄúBird in Jeopardy‚Äù as well as on the locally rare species list maintained by the National Forest. The Tennessee dace, found in Bear Creek and Reed Creek, is listed as a federally sensitive species by the Forest Service. There are potentially 1262 acres of old growth forest. Along Reed Creek there is a mature woodland with a hardwood forest on adjacent hillsides as well as meadows and marshland in low-lying areas/ The variety of features creates habitat for a great diversity of birds, with ruffed grouse, wild turkey, and a large number of warblers including northern parula, blue, black-and-white, Blackburnian, American redstart, ovenbird and common yellowthroat. And there are many other woodland species as well. Topography The wildland is part of the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Ecosystem Section. Ridges, composed of sandstone and shale, run northeast/southwest, with parallel valleys created from limestone or shale. The area includes three mountains, Walker, Brushy, and Little Brushy, as well as the headwaters of Bear Creek, Reed Creek and Guillion Fork. Monster Rock, located on the eastern end of the area, is a huge outcrop sticking out from the ridgetop of Walker Mountain. The lowest elevation of 2360 feet is found in Six Valley, and the high elevation of 3955 feet is found at a point on the crest of Walker Mountain. Forest Service management Congress has declared a 5503-acre section on the Smyth County side of the area a National Scenic Area called the Bear Creek National Scenic Area. In this section logging and road building are prohibited, but other activities, such as mountain biking, are allowed. Most of the remaining area has been inventoried and is listed as an inventoried roadless area. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in inventoried roadless areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Since most of Crawfish Valley was inventoried in the roadless area review, it is protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area in Smyth County is a national scenic area, the remaining area in Smyth Countyii, located near Newman Hollow Rd. (Rt. 6261) in Smyth county, was designated ‚ÄúBlack Bear Habitat‚Äù. Most of the remaining area on the Wythe County side is designated as ‚ÄúBackcountry-Natural Processes‚Äù or ‚ÄúBackcountry-Nonmotorized‚Äù. A large part in Six Valley is designated ‚ÄúRuffed Grouse Habitat‚Äù, and the eastern end of the wildarea has a section designated ‚ÄúMaintenance/Restoration of Forest Communities‚Äù and ‚ÄúScenic Corridor‚Äù. The highest level of protection for backcountry areas is the ‚ÄúBackcountry-Natural Process‚Äù designation. The area includes 243 acres of land for which the mineral rights are privately owned. Cultural history The Mozer Place, an old homesite in Crawfish Valley, is next to the Crawfish Trail. As of March 1998, a survey for cultural resources in about 1085 acres found nine prehistoric transient camps. There is a high probability of finding historic farmsteads within the area.

The term can mean a type of English heavily influenced by another language (typically the speaker's L1) in accent, lexis, syntax, etc., or to the practice of code-switching between languages. In some cases, the word refers to the use of the Latin alphabet to write languages that use a difference script, especially common on computer platforms that only allow Latin input such as online chat, social networks, emails and SMS.

Life  Digby Moran grew up on Cabbage Tree Island on the Richmond River in New South Wales, Australia. His father was a member of the Dunghutti race and his mother a Bundjalung. His grandfather, Robert Moran, was a wood carver and from an early age Digby worked with him, making boomerangs and walking sticks. In his early adult years he worked as an agricultural cane cutter and also as a boxer with Jimmy Sharman's touring troupe. Eventually Moran returned to that first love of his people's art and completed a TAFE arts course in 1991. After a nationally and internationally recognised career as a visual artist, Moran died in Lismore in January 2020.  Work  An early work, 'Lizard and Snake' was made for the Lismore branch of the Aboriginal and Torres State Islander Commission, depicting the creation story of the Goanna headland at Evans Head. In 2006, Moran held an exhibition Memories of the island exhibited at the Tweed River Art Gallery. Moran's work was represented in the I saw the sun - east coast exhibition at the Lismore Regional Gallery in 2007 together with Jenny Fraser, Frances Belle Parker, Fiona Foley, Ian Abdulla and Vincent Serico.

The jury would eventually decide in 1999 that there was a conspiracy perpetrated by Jowers and other conspirators. Background In 1993, Loyd Jowers appeared on the ABC News program PrimeTime Live. He claimed that he was paid $100,000 by alleged Memphis mobster Frank Liberto to help organize the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Jowers owned a Memphis coffee shop on the first floor of the rooming house from which King was allegedly shot by James Earl Ray. Jowers had remained silent for twenty-five years after King's assassination, but he only produced his confession after Ray's HBO mock trial. He claimed that he was part of a larger conspiracy to assassinate King and frame Ray as a patsy. He also claimed that \\"Raoul,\\" Memphis Police Officers, and the mafia had been involved. Jowers named Memphis Police Lieutenant Earl Clark as the shooter. Trial In 1999, a civil suit brought by Coretta Scott King alleged that Jowers and others had conspired to assassinate King. The King family turned to William Pepper, who had defended Ray in his HBO mock trial, to represent them in the wrongful death lawsuit, King family vs. Loyd Jowers and other unknown co-conspirators. During the four-week trial, Pepper brought forward over 70 witnesses and thousands of documents. Jowers testified that Ray was only a scapegoat and that Memphis police officer Earl Clark actually fired the fatal shots instead. Decision upright The jury that heard the case took only one hour of deliberations to reach a unanimous verdict: that King was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.https://thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial They found Jowers responsible, and also found that \\"governmental agencies\\" were among the conspirators. The King family was granted the $100 they requested in damages, and they saw it as vindication. King's son, Dexter, said: \\"This is the period at the end of the sentence. So please, after today, we don't want questions like, 'Do you believe James Earl Ray killed your father?' I've been hearing that all my life. No, I don't, and this is the end of it.\\" Dexter further emphasized that \\"the shooter was the Memphis Police Department Officer, Lt. Earl Clark.\\" Coretta King said after the verdict: \\"There is abundant evidence of a major, high-level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband.\\" The jury found that the mafia and various government agencies \\"were deeply involved in the assassination. ... Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame.\\"https://www.courierpress.com/story/opinion/columnists/jon- webb/2018/04/06/50-years-later-conspiracies-still-swirl-around-martin-luther- kings-death/491685002/ Result and Criticism The decision caused the Department of Justice to reopen the case. In 2000, Attorney General Janet Reno announced, that after looking into the assassination, no evidence of a conspiracy could be found. The Department of Justice found numerous inconsistencies in Jowers' statements. They also concluded there was no proof Frank Liberto belonged to the mafia and that the witnesses that supported Jowers were not credible or contradictory in their opinion. Furthermore, they expressed their belief that Jowers fabricated his story for financial reward. Gerald Posner, an investigative journalist who wrote the book Killing the Dream in which he makes the case that Ray was the killer, said after the verdict: \\"It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.\\" Robert Blakey also criticized Pepper's theories on the case.

The precipitation patterns are forming as a reaction of two electrolytes: a highly concentrated \\"outer\\" one diffuses into a hydrogel, while the \\"inner\\" one is dissolved in the gel itself. The colloidal precipitate which builds up the patterns is trapped by the gel and kept at the location where it is formed. , similar to the Liesegang rings. The first representative of this class of reactions was the NaOH (outer electrolyte)+CuCl2 (inner electrolyte) . Later the NaOH+AgNO3 , the CuCl2+K3[Fe(CN)6] , the NaOH+AlCl3 , and the NH3+AgNO3 reactions in several hydrogels have also proved to show similar behavior. Precipitate patterns forming in these reactions are exceptionally rich. Besides the macroscopic shapes like layered structures, helices and cardioids, regular sheets of colloidal precipitate may also emerge with a periodicity even less than 20 micrometers (microscopic patterns). Macroscopic patterns The arrangement that best shows the sequence of events leading to the formation of macroscopic patters is the one in which the outer electrolyte penetrates in a thin gel sheet located between two glass plates. In this case, the diffusion front has a quasi-one-dimensional shape. If there are some impurities or obstacles in the gel, the precipitation may cease at these points, and the traveling precipitation front following the diffusion front will split. As the broken precipitation front advances, its active segments are getting shorter, resulting in triangle-like regions free of precipitate behind the front. The reason why the precipitation temporarily or permanently stops in these regions is that the oblique, passive edges of the precipitate act as a semipermeable membrane, blocking the diffusion of the outer electrolyte . The mechanism behind the regression of the active front segments is not fully understood. It is believed that a diffusive intermediate compound forms at the active segments having reduced concentration at the sides, and a critical concentration is required for the precipitation to occur. When the outer electrolyte is poured onto the top of a gel column in a glass tube, the diffusion front takes roughly the form of a disk. In this case, the precipitation fronts involved in pattern formation can perform more complicated motions, leading to more complex patterns that depend on the outer and inner electrolyte concentration. These include the formation of multi- armed helices, intermingled cardioids, Voronoi tessellations, so-called target patterns and other, even more complex shapes. Microscopic patterns In certain conditions, for example when the cation of the inner electrolyte is Cu2+ or Ag2+, regular sheets consisting of colloidal grains are formed . This phenomenon is especially striking when the reactions run in poly(vinyl)alcohol gels, and the speed of the precipitation front falls below about 0.3 Œºm/s. The finest microscopic patterns have been observed in the NaOH+AgNO3 reactions, where the periodicity dropped below 10 Œºm.

Maxwell, an officer of dragoons, spent much of his career with the English and subsequently the Irish Royal Army; during the Williamite war in Ireland he was a member of the Jacobite party, remaining loyal to the deposed James II. Following the Jacobite defeat in Ireland and a period of imprisonment in England, Maxwell entered French service on the Continent, where he was killed in battle soon afterwards. Life Maxwell's wife Jane, widow of the 6th Duke of Norfolk Relatively little is known of Maxwell‚Äôs origins. His family were members of the tiny Scottish Roman Catholic minority, and were a cadet branch of the family of Maxwell of Kirkconnel, Kirkcudbrightshire. He entered the Scots College, Douai in 1662, but transferred to the Royal Scots College in Madrid in 1664 at his own request. Although as a Catholic his career prospects were limited, Maxwell joined the army in 1671. After the accession of the Catholic James II to the throne, Maxwell's prospects improved, particularly as a protege of James's close advisor the Earl of Melfort. He was appointed colonel of Princess Anne of Denmark's Regiment of Dragoons in England in 1688, replacing John Berkeley, 4th Viscount Fitzhardinge. While stationed in England he married Jane Howard, widow of the 6th Duke of Norfolk. Several engraved portraits of Maxwell after a now lost portrait by Closterman exist. Williamite War At the time of the Glorious Revolution of late 1688, Maxwell was among the officers who stayed loyal to James after his deposition by his Protestant son-in-law William. Travelling to Ireland, where the army remained under James‚Äôs control, he was given the colonelcy of the Seventh Regiment of dragoons; he was stationed at Bangor in eastern Ulster at the time of the main Williamite landings in 1689. During the subsequent conflict Maxwell was present at the Jacobite defeat at the Boyne. Commissioned as one of six Jacobite major-generals, he was one of the officers appointed to advise James‚Äôs illegitimate son the Duke of Berwick, who was given overall command of the army during the later part of 1690. Maxwell and Berwick were supporters of the plans of James‚Äôs viceroy Tyrconnell to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict. Another faction of the Jacobite leadership, led by Patrick Sarsfield, opposed seeking a settlement; when in late 1690 they sent fellow generals Luttrell and Purcell to France to argue their case, Berwick ordered Maxwell to accompany them, with secret instructions to have them arrested on arrival. According to Berwick's memoirs, Luttrell and Purcell discovered the plan during the voyage and suggested throwing Maxwell overboard, before being dissuaded by the Bishop of Cork. During the 1691 campaign Maxwell was assigned as commander of the garrison of Athlone during its siege by the Williamite army; the efforts of his regiment of dragoons to defend the bridge over the River Shannon later became a celebrated example of bravery. He was taken prisoner when the defences were overrun; Sarsfield's faction later unfairly accused Maxwell of treachery due to his links with Tyrconnell. Maxwell was sent to the Tower of London along with William Dorrington and several other senior Jacobites captured at Aughrim shortly after the fall of Athlone. The main Jacobite force eventually capitulated at Limerick in October, ending the war. Death After his release in January 1693, Maxwell rejoined the remainder of the former Jacobite army, which had entered French service under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick. He was killed at the Battle of Marsaglia in October.

The Upper Fortress was destroyed in the 10th century by the Arabian conqueror Abul Kassim but was restored in the 12th century by King George III who used it as a treasury.

It peaked at No. 75 on the ARIA Charts. A limited edition vinyl was released of only 600 copies. Background and promotion According to In Hearts Wake guitarist Ben Nairne, a collaboration between the two bands had been in the works since at least 2015, however both band's busy schedules didn't permit them any free time. The extended play was recorded in secret and released without any prior announcement on 20 April 2016. To promote the EP, Northlane and In Hearts Wake co-headlined a tour in June. Supporting them were Hands Like Houses and Ocean Grove. A music video for the entire EP was released on 19 October. Writing and composition In Hearts Wake frontman Jake Taylor described it as a \\"surprise twelve-minute EP odyssey\\". Equinox contains messages and themes of environmental preservation and other politically relevant issues. The track \\"Refuge\\" concerns the then- current issue of illegal immigration to Australia. \\"Hologram\\" describes how communities can be destroyed by people who are controlled by fear.

Disputes  This map continues to be used in news media, but Vietnam does not in fact claim EEZ to the blue line, which is an extrapolation based on projection from the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam avoided in its 2009 submissions to CLCS. Vietnam‚Äôs disputes are mainly with the People's Republic of China. Vietnam rejects China's nine-dash line which extends much further than China's from its shores. The nine-dash line cuts straight through Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the South China Sea and would reduce Vietnam's EEZ by 3/4th. This line also cuts the EEZ of the Philippines and Malaysia in half. Brunei would lose 90% of its EEZ. According to former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, \\"China's nine-dash line territorial claim over the entire South China Sea is against international laws, particularly the United Nations Convention of the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS)\\". Vietnam also rejected the Chinese claim, citing that it is baseless and against the UNCLOS. In the spring of 2014, China and Vietnam clashed over China's Haiyang Shiyou oil rig in Vietnam's EEZ. The incident left seventeen Vietnamese injured and damaged both China's and Vietnam's ships. = Paracel and Spratly Islands = The Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands are historically part of Vietnam. The Geneva Accords of 1954, which ended the First Indochina War, gave South Vietnam control of the Vietnamese territories south of the 17th Parallel, which included the islands in the Paracels and Spratlys. In 1974, during the Vietnam War, the PRC used military force in the Paracel Islands and took Yagong Island and the Crescent group of reefs from South Vietnam. Since the 1990s China still occupies and controls all of the Paracel Islands. The PRC controls all of the features in the Paracels. Vietnam controls 29 features of the Spratly Islands. However, since 2013 China has been constructing artificial islands on reefs and military bases which changed the balance of power in favour of the PRC in the South China Sea.

Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the history of the Harvard Society to become a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the MIT Media Lab. The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other applications. Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is ‚Äúcoded‚Äù in various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that can ‚Äúdecode‚Äù these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy. Early life Canan Daƒüdeviren was born in Istanbul, Turkey on May 4, 1985. She is the oldest of three siblings, and has two younger brothers. Canan completed her primary education in ƒ∞zmit, where she also attended middle school. However, her family was forced to leave the city after the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake, and she continued her high school education in Adana. Dagdeviren was drawn to scientific exploration from a very young age. In an interview with Discover Magazine, she recalls being fascinated by smashing rocks together and producing sparks, saying ‚ÄúI loved the idea that you deform this material and create sparks -- it was very exciting.‚Äù Another source of inspiration came from a book that her father gave her on the life of Marie Curie. She quickly became infatuated not just with Curie's work, but also with the research conducted by her husband Pierre Curie, who Dagdeviren considers her ‚Äúscientific love.‚Äù Pierre and his brother Jacques first described piezoelectricity in 1880, a concept that would later serve as the driving force behind many of Dagdeviren's own projects and applications. Finally, at the heart of her work is Dagdeviren's own family. An early source of inspiration was learning about her grandfather, who died of heart failure at age 28. Even as a young girl, she promised herself that someday she would create technology that would decode and monitor similar health issues to honor his memory. Education & Academic Career Canan Dagdeviren studied Physics Engineering at the Hacettepe University in Ankara, graduating in 2007. She obtained a Master of Science degree from Sabancƒ± University in Istanbul, and won a Fulbright scholarship for study in the United States. With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where she focused on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts mechanical energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices. It is soft and flexible and conforms to the heart as well as other soft tissues. This technology could extend the battery life of implanted electronics or eliminate the need for battery replacement, sparing patients from repeated operations and the risk of surgical complications. In August 2014 she received her PhD degree. Her advisor was John A. Rogers, and the title of her PhD thesis was Ferroelectric/Piezoelectric Materials Flexible/Stretchable/Wearable/Implantable Sensors, Actuators, Mechanical Energy Harvesters, Transducers, Microfabrication. Dagdeviren then went to Cambridge, MA to become a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University‚Äîthe first Turkish scientist in the history of the Harvard Society to do so‚Äîas well as a postdoctoral research associate at MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Her postdoctoral advisor was MIT Institute Professor Robert S. Langer. Currently, Dagdeviren is an Assistant Professor at MIT. She teaches a course on conformable devices every semester, and also serves as a freshman advisor. Recently, she was invited to present to the World.Minds community at the annual invitation-only symposium in Zurich, Switzerland. Her most recent research and achievements are summarized in her World.Minds talk.  Projects & Publications  = YellowBox = alt=The YellowBox is a cleanroom used by Conformable Decoders at the MIT Media Lab, which Dagdeviren designed and constructed from the ground up in 2017. When she was a PhD student, she promised herself that if she ever had the opportunity to build her own space, it would be physically transparent so that anyone passing by would have the ability to observe, take notes, and learn from her without needing any special permissions. This inclusivity is part of what makes YellowBox such a unique scientific environment. Another unique aspect of YellowBox is that it is organized using 5S Methodology. 5S is a system which uses five guiding practices to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain. Essentially, 5S is an organizational methodology that uses visual labels‚Äîcolor-coded based on functionality‚Äîto organize spaces and increase safety, identifying potential hazards and procedural information. As a result of this highly organized and efficient system, YellowBox achieved a Green Labs certification by Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) in 2017‚Äîthe first research lab at the MIT Media Lab to receive this designation since its founding in 1985. Recently, Dagdeviren published an article featured in Advanced Intelligent Systems describing her group's experience with greater efficiency, as a result of the 5S Methodology principles.148x148px = Conformal Piezoelectric Mechanical Energy Harvesters: Mechanically Invisible Human Dynamos (PZT MEH) = In 2014, Dagdeviren and her team developed conformal piezoelectric mechanical energy harvesters, which have been described as ‚Äúmechanically invisible human dynamos.‚Äù This project seeks to develop conformal piezoelectric patches integrated into personal garments to extract energy from body movements such as the motion of arms, fingers, and legs. In the future, this work could improve quality life for people and potentially provide environmentally friendly power. Since these energy harvesters are powered by human motion instead of battery power, the need for replacements and high risk/high cost surgical procedures to change depleted batteries could be eliminated. = Flexible Piezoelectric Devices for Gastrointestinal Motility Sensing (PZT GI-S) = 161x161px In 2017, the PZT GI-S project (essentially ‚Äúa Fitbit for the stomach.\\") was published. Dagdeviren and fellow collaborators designed an ingestible, flexible piezoelectric device that senses mechanical deformation within the gastric cavity. They demonstrated the capabilities of the sensor in both in vitro and ex vivo simulated gastric models, quantified its key behaviors in the gastrointestinal tract using computational modelling, and validated its functionality in awake and ambulating swine. The proof-of-concept device may lead to the development of ingestible piezoelectric devices that might safely sense mechanical variations and harvest mechanical energy inside the gastrointestinal tract for the diagnosis and treatment of motility disorders, as well as for monitoring ingestion in bariatric applications. = Miniaturized Neural System For Chronic, Local Intracerebral Drug Delivery (MiNDS) = 162x162px In 2018, Dagdeviren and her team developed an implantable, remotely controllable, miniaturized neural drug delivery system permitting dynamic adjustment of therapy with pinpoint spatial accuracy. Recent advances in medications for neurodegenerative disorders are expanding opportunities for improving the debilitating symptoms suffered by patients. Existing pharmacologic treatments, however, often rely on systemic drug administration, which result in broad drug distribution and consequent increased risk for toxicity. Given that many key neural circuitries have sub‚Äìcubic millimeter volumes and cell-specific characteristics, small-volume drug administration into affected brain areas with minimal diffusion and leakage is essential. Dagdeviren and her team demonstrates that this device can chemically modulate local neuronal activity in small-animal (rodent) and large-animal (nonhuman primate) models, while simultaneously allowing the recording of neural activity to enable feedback control. = Electronic Textile Conformable Suit (E-TeCS) = E-TeCS In 2020, Dagdeviren and her team created a tailored, electronic textile conformable suit (E-TeCS) to perform large-scale, multi-modal physiological (temperature, heart rate, and respiration) sensing in vivo. The rapid advancement of electronic devices and fabrication technologies has further promoted the field of wearables and smart textiles. However, most of the current efforts in textile electronics focus on a single modality and cover a small area. E-TeCS introduces a new platform of modular, conformable (i.e., flexible and stretchable) distributed sensor networks that can be embedded into digitally-knit textiles. This platform can be customized for various forms, sizes and functions using standard, accessible and high-throughput textile manufacturing and garment patterning techniques.  Exhibitions  = The Bees of Science = 180x180px In June 2019, Dagdeviren blended media, art, and science to create an exhibition which was featured in the lobby of the Media Lab for 8 months. The exhibition displayed her students‚Äô work, and was titled The Bees of Science. In a blog post, she explained ‚ÄúLike bees, my students work at the intersection of nature, art, and science, drawing on both their experiences in diverse fields of science and engineering and also their diverse cultural backgrounds, much as the bees draw nectar from a host of different flowers. They then apply their minds, hearts, and hands to create unique micro- and nano-scale, mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems for human health monitoring‚Äîtheir scientific ‚Äúhoney.‚Äù Awards & Honors In 2014, Dagdeviren became the first Turkish scientist to be elected as a Junior Fellow of Harvard. In 2015, MIT Technology Review named her among the \\"Top 35 Innovators Under 35\\" (inventor category), and Forbes magazine selected her as one of the \\"Top 30 Under 30 in Science.\\" The following year she received many honors, including being named a Gifted Citizen by Ciudad de las Ideas of Puebla, Mexico, and the Spotlight Health Scholar by Aspen Institute. She placed first in the Medical Innovation Category of Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World (TOYP) by Junior Chamber International (JCI), and received the 2017 Innovation and Technology Delegate of the American Academy of Achievement Award. Dagdeviren was also awarded the Science and Sci Life Prize for Young Scientists in Translational Medicine Category by Science/AAAS and SciLifeLab, and attended the Nobel Prize Ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden. Since beginning her current position at the MIT Media Lab, Dagdeviren and her students published a paper ‚ÄúTowards personalized medicine: the evolution of imperceptible healthcare technologies,‚Äù published in the November 2018 issue of Foresight, a journal of future studies, strategic thinking, and policy. The paper was selected by the journal's editorial board as an Outstanding Paper for the 2019 Emerald Literati Awards. In 2019, Dagdeviren was awarded the Kadir Has University Promising Scientist Award, and recognized in Fortune Turkey's ‚Äú40 Under 40.‚Äù She was also named as one of the United States's ‚Äú87 brightest young engineers‚Äù by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and took part in the NAE's 25th annual US Frontiers of Engineering (USFOE) Symposium.  Media  Dagdeviren's work has been featured in many media outlets, including The Washington Post, IEEE Spectrum, Forbes, Discover Magazine, MedGadget, Stat News, Nature Materials, AP News and more. = UN Talk = In addition to her work in the materials science and engineering fields, Dagdeviren seeks to inspire an upcoming generation of young scientists, specifically young women pursuing STEM careers. She uses social media as a tool to connect with young minds across the globe, specifically through her Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts. In February 2018, she was invited to speak at the Women in Science in Diplomacy for Sustaining Peace and Development event as part of the celebration of International Day of Women and Girls in Science at the United Nations. Since 2015, she has participated in numerous Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) panels across the globe and in various outreach activities that target women. = Blog = Dagdeviren enjoys sharing her personal take on leading a research group, teaching, and working in YellowBox through perspective posts on her blog.  Personal  In an interview, Dagdeviren said that she was inspired for science by two books; a book on the life of the twice Nobel Prize-winning Polish-French physicist and chemist Marie Curie (1867‚Äì1934) and Turkish theoretical physicist Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º‚Äôs (1926‚Äì2007) book of his memories (Anƒ±lar ve D√º≈ü√ºnceler). She also finds great inspiration in Rumi, a 13th-century Turkish poet who practiced Sufism‚Äîa movement to understand the universe under the lenses of sensation, beauty and love as well as care about integrity, dignity and sincerity.
