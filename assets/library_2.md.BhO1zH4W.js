In 1994, he pleaded guilty to robbing 14 banks in the United States, receiving a 12-year sentence, but was released in 2004, and fled the country while on parole. He then robbed 21 banks in Canada, before fleeing to France on his French passport. In 2016, he was extradited to Canada, and in 2017, was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to pay back nearly $450,000 in restitution after pleading guilty to seven counts of robbery using a firearm. Early life Shuman was born in Los Angeles County, California, U.S. in 1962. He is a dual citizen of the United States and France, acquired through his maternal grandmother who immigrated to the United States from Southern France in 1946. After high school, he served in the U.S. Navy and studied fashion merchandising before working in the mortgage and banking field between 1985 and 1987. He moved to Miami, Florida in the early 1990s and worked as a land developer, living a lavish lifestyle despite having no sales for three years. Bank robberies =United States= Between 1992 and 1993, Shuman robbed over a dozen banks in Florida and Tennessee jumping over the counters and raiding the cash drawers. In 1993, while driving in Alabama, he was stopped for speeding; officers searched the trunk of his rental car and found a trash bag with a police radio scanner, an air pistol, plastic gloves, maps of Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee and baseball caps under the spare tire. He only received a traffic citation, but within days, a warrant was issued for bank robbery and the FBI arrested him in Miami. In 1994, he pleaded guilty to robbing 14 banks, receiving a 12-year sentence, but was released in 2004. He fled the United States while on parole. He was dubbed the \\"Reebok Bandit\\" by FBI agents because he wore tennis shoes during his heists. =Canada= Six years later, Shuman began robbing banks in Canada, 12 in York Region, Ontario (Markham, Richmond Hill and Vaughan), four in Calgary, Alberta, two in the Region of Peel, Ontario, and one in each of Hamilton, Ottawa and Toronto between 2010 and 2015 ‚Äì a total of 21 robberies in Canada. Shuman became more violent as the robberies progressed, waiting for employees to open the banks in the morning and holding them at gun point locking them in the vault. He managed to steal a total of about $450,000 from the robberies, most of which were successful. Extradition and sentence After Shuman's last robbery in Mississauga, Ontario, on May 8, 2015, he fled Canada to France using his French passport. York Regional Police issued an international arrest warrant, and four months later, on September 15, 2015, with the help of French, German, Swiss and Danish authorities who monitored his activities in Europe, tracked him down to Geneva, Switzerland, where he was arrested on his way from France. Shuman was due for extradition to Canada on February 23, 2016, however, Shuman faked chest pains over French airspace in an attempt to force the commercial plane to land in France since the country does not extradite their citizens. Instead, the plane landed in London, England where Shuman was taken to hospital with no evidence of heart problems. Due to this situation, commercial airlines would not allow him to fly, so a private jet was arranged landing in Toronto. Shuman faced 31 criminal charges, including 11 counts of armed robbery. On July 25, 2017, Shuman was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to pay back nearly $450,000 in restitution, in a Newmarket courthouse, after pleading guilty to seven counts of robbery using a firearm.

As a young man he had represented Scotland at rugby on three occasions. During the First World War he jointly published an account of the value of sphagnum moss as a wound dressing which led to its widespread use by the British Army for that purpose. As conservator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) he enlarged the museum accommodation, expanded the museum collection with the addition of over 1,300 new specimens and a large collection of histological slides. His creation of the first comprehensive catalogue of the museum collection greatly enhanced its value as a teaching and research resource. His textbook A Surgical Handbook, written jointly with Francis Caird and first published in 1889, became a best seller running to 19 editions by 1921.  Early life  Charles Walker Cathcart was born in Edinburgh on 16 March 1853, the son of James Cathcart, a Leith wine merchant and his wife Helen (n√©e Weir). He attended Loretto School, Musselburgh, where he was captain of the school rugby team. From school he went on to take an arts course at the University of Edinburgh, which included classes in logic and philosophy and he graduated MA in 1873. Cathcart then entered the university medical school and graduated MB CM in 1878. As an undergraduate he represented the university at rugby and in athletics at Scottish Inter-University sports competitions. Rugby Union career =Amateur career= Cathcart played rugby for the University of Edinburgh. =Provincial career= Cathcart represented Edinburgh District and played in the world's first non-international representative match in December 1872; the \\"inter-city\\", the inter-district match between Edinburgh District and Glasgow District. Cathcart also played for East of Scotland in 1876.https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000060/18760228/032/0006 =International career= He was capped three times for Scotland, his debut coming in the second international match in 1872 when Scotland played England at The Oval, London. His only score in international rugby was a drop goal against England.  Surgical career  Cathcart was house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) under Professor Thomas Annandale. Showing an early interest in a career in surgery he passed the examinations to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd) in 1879 and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (FRCSE) the following year. He went on to become a lecturer in anatomy and then a lecturer in surgery in the extramural school of medicine at Surgeons' Hall. His surgical career progressed when he became assistant surgeon in the RIE in 1884, advancing to Surgeon-in-ordinary in 1901. During the First World War he became Extra Surgeon before retiring in 1918 and becoming Consulting Surgeon. The Liston Victoria jubilee prize was awarded to him by the RCSEd in 1893. In 1908 Cathcart joined the newly established Territorial Force, forerunner of the Territorial Army, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He served in the surgical unit of 2nd Scottish General Hospital at Craigleith (later the Western General Hospital), going on to become chief surgeon at the Bangour military hospital in West Lothian. In 1919 he became surgeon to Edenhall Hospital, Musselburgh which had been established as a specialist hospital to care for servicemen who had lost limbs. Cathcart was gazetted CBE (military) for his wartime service. Cathcart had a flair for mechanical design. He designed a microtome for frozen section, a technique which had only recently been introduced into surgical practice. Aseptic surgical technique was at an early stage of development when he designed and built a steriliser for surgical dressings. This had the dual advantages of being cheap to produce and easy to work. He adapted a version of the Sprengel vacuum pump so that it could be used safely for bladder drainage. A popular teacher he distilled much of his surgical teaching into his Surgical Handbook For the Use of Students, Practitioners, House- Surgeons, and Dressers, which he wrote jointly with Professor Francis Caird. This became popular because it contained much practical advice and guidance and the single volume was small enough to fit into a coat pocket. The book went through 19 editions between 1889 and 1921. In later life, he produced jointly with his colleague J. N. Jackson Hartley an expanded and updated version of the original entitled Requisites and methods in surgery. = Sphagnum moss in surgery = Sphagnum moss wound dressings being made at the University of Toronto c. 1914 Sphagnum moss had been used as a wound dressing by German practitioners since the 1880s, but had not been used to any extent in Britain. It is known to have absorbent properties and antiseptic properties as it creates an acidic environment in wounds which inhibits bacterial growth. In 1914 Cathcart and his friend Professor Isaac Bayley Balfour, Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (RBGEd) wrote an article for The Scotsman. In this they described how the moss could absorb and hold 20 times its own weight of water, and, as this could equally apply to lymph, wound exudate, blood or pus, they suggested its use as a wound dressing. It was more absorbent than the standard cotton wool dressing and at the time cotton wool was becoming more difficult to obtain as supplies were being used in the manufacture of gun cotton for explosives. Moreover, they argued, cotton wool had to be imported, at considerable expense and risk, while the moss was widely available in the colder, wetter areas of the British Isles and was free. They pointed out it had been shown in Germany to have antiseptic properties and to promote wound healing. Aware of the irony in copying an idea from an enemy country, they wrote, quoting Ovid: \\"Fas est et ab hoste doceri\\"‚Äîit is right to be taught even by the enemy. Cathcart subsequently published an account in the British Medical Journal and asked the War Office for permission for its general use as a wound dressing. The War Office Medical Department agreed to this request in February 1916. Cathcart then set up a local arrangement in Edinburgh for the collection and drying of the moss and its packaging as dressings. A similar enterprise was set up in Dublin, in England and then in the United States when it joined the war, most using Cathcart's model as an exemplar. In 1916 the London Graphic reported that \\"the collecting, drying and making into surgical dressings of Sphagnum moss has become a national industry in Scotland ... the work is being extended all over Ireland, England and Wales.\\" It was estimated that by 1918, around one million moss dressings each month were being sent to the Western Front and more distant theatres of war.  Museum conservator  Cathcart's appointment as conservator of Surgeons' Hall Museum in 1887 marked the start of a period of regeneration for the museum. Finding that the catalogue was decades out of date he created a new catalogue using modern terminology and arranged the layout of the specimens to correspond to this, greatly increasing the value of the collection as an educational resource. He introduced some 1300 specimens into the collection in addition to a large collection of histopathology slides. In several of the older museum specimens the diagnosis was in doubt, so he also took samples from these and made slides using the microtome whose design he would later improve as the 'Cathcart microtome'. Using his expertise in interpreting such slides and with the help of pathologists, he was able to confirm or refute earlier diagnoses. He was responsible for the expansion of the museum accommodation which took place in stages between 1894 and 1908. Although he resigned as conservator in 1900, he became chairman of the museum curators and continued to influence the development which he had started.  Family and later life  In 1885 Cathcart married Mary Guthrie Tait (1857‚Äì1946) and they had three daughters and a son. Their son Francis John Cathcart (b. 1894) was killed in action in the Mesopotamian campaign in the First World War on 9 June 1916 serving in the Royal Field Artillery. In memory of his son, Cathcart arranged for a play area to be built for the children of the Cowgate and Grassmarket at the Cowgate mission of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society which he actively supported. Cathcart died on 22 February 1932.

She was married to Harry Harlow from 1946 until her death in 1971. Early life Margaret Ruth Kuenne was born in St. Louis on 29 August 1918 to Edward S. Kuenne and Margaret E. Kuenne; she was the oldest of three children (her siblings were economist Robert E. Kuenne and atomic physicist Dorothy Kuenne Stearns). She received her bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, at the age of twenty, and her master's degree from the same university two years later in 1940. She received her doctoral degree in psychology from the University of Iowa, where she studied Hull's theories of conditioning in children under Kenneth Spence, in 1944. Her dissertation considered how theoretical research could be conducted with children to bridge the gap between studies with mature humans and studies with animals such as monkeys. Career After receiving her doctorate, she worked as an instructor at the University of Minnesota for two years before becoming an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin in 1946. Shortly after her arrival at the University of Wisconsin, she was recruited by Harry Harlow to run studies with children to supplement his work on learning with monkeys. She assembled a small group of children with high IQs, and measured the speed at which they learned to solve puzzles for a small reward. She remained at the University of Wisconsin until her death, where she worked closely with Harlow, whom she married in 1948, and served as a project associate in his primate laboratory. (The university's nepotism rules meant that she was not allowed faculty status for the majority of her time there.) Toward the end of her career, she raised monkeys in nuclear family situations to study the effects of paternal love. In 1965, she returned to teaching as a lecturer in the Department of Educational Psychology, and was made a full professor in 1970. Margaret Harlow was a talented editor and administrator as well as an accomplished psychologist. She was a leading member of the Society for Research in Child Development. She founded the publications office of the American Psychological Association (now the Office of Publications and Databases) in 1950, and served as its first director. With Harry Harlow, she published numerous articles and co-edited the Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology. Personal life While working with Harry Harlow at the University in Wisconsin, the two gradually developed affections for each other, and married on 3 February 1948 in Anamosa, Iowa. They kept the marriage quiet in hopes of evading the university's nepotism policies, but the administration eventually found out, and Margaret was forced to step down from her professorship (though the Harlows managed to circumvent university policy by employing her as a project associate in Harry's primate lab). Though her family had always called her \\"Margaret\\", Harry called her \\"Peggy.\\" They had two children together; their daughter Pamela was born in 1950, and their son Jonathan in 1953. The family lived in a house that was close to both the university and the zoo. In 1967, Margaret was diagnosed with breast cancer. She continued to work for several more years, citing a desire to teach as a full professor as a driving force, but regretted that she likely would not see the results of her nuclear family monkey studies. She died on 11 August 1971.

IDF Commander in Gaza Strip was a 1992 case argued before Israel's High Court of Justice. Justice G. Bach delivered the majority opinion. Mohammad Alamarin filed a petition seeking to prevent the confiscation and demolition of his family's home after his son confessed to murdering 15 year old Helena Rapp. The HCJ held that the IDF commander acted within his authority under r.119 of the Defence (Emergency) Regulations when he ordered the demolition of the petitioner's sons home. Background Mohammed Alamarin's son, Fuad, was arrested by the police after the murder of 15 year old Helena Rapp. On the morning of the murder Fuad left his house with two knives he had taken from the kitchen of his home. With the knives on his person, he traveled by taxi to Bat Yam in Israel.. He told police he decided to kill the girl because he was unable to find work. Fuad admitted that he left his home with the knife because he wanted to hurt \\"Jews or an Israeli Arab.\\" He confessed to stabbing Helena three to four times before running away. In his statement Fuad said he \\"continued stabbing her even when she fell.\\"Alamarin, at ¬∂ 2. After Fuad's confession IDF Commander ordered the house sealed pending demolition. The confiscation and demolition of Fuad's house was authorized by the military commander under the Defence (Emergency) Regulations. Fuad's family who also lived in the same house challenged the demolition order, arguing that Fuad was not the sole resident of the house. After the legal adviser in Gaza rejected the family's petition, Fuad's father filed his petition in the High Court of Justice (HCJ). The demolition was barred pending the outcome of his case before the HCJ. The Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945 authorized the IDF commander in this case to destroy a building inhabited by a person who has committed a violent offense.Defence (Emergency) Regulations, 1945, r.119; See also (holding that IDF commander's decision to destroy petitioner's house was \\"not unreasonable\\" because petitioner's son had committed a murder). The family's petition objected to the demolition on two grounds. #They argued that the sealing, confiscation and destruction of Fuad's family home was not permitted under r.119 of the Regulations because Fuad had committed the murder in Israel. This argument relied on the territorial limitation of the Regulations.Alamarin, HCJ 2722/92 at ¬∂4. #They further argued that the Regulations would only permit the confiscation and destruction of the guilty party's room, not the entire building. Many members of Fuad's family shared the residence and they had not taken part in Fuad's actions.See (Cheshin, J., dissenting) (discussing the need to construe r.119 narrowly to limit commander's authority to only the residential unit of the suspect). Issue Does r. 119 of the Regulations permit the destruction of a house in the occupied territory of Gaza for a violent offense that was committed in Israel by a resident of that house? The High Court Decision =Majority= The HCJ ruled that the demolition was reasonable under the circumstances. The majority opinion was written by Justice G. Bach. In its opinion the HCJ wrote that an offense was committed under r.59(b) of the Regulations when Fuad left his home carrying a \\"particularly long knife\\" with the intention of killing or causing serious injury for a person, within the meaning of r.59(b): > \\"No person shall - .................. (b) have in his possession any weapon, > instrument or article or thing designed or adapted for causing death or > serious injury...\\"Alamarin, at ¬∂ 5 (alteration in original) (citation > omitted) Based on this language, the HCJ reasoned that r.119 did apply to the facts at issue in this case. They held that the confiscation and demolition order were within the commander's authority with regards to the first issue raised by the family's petition. The HCJ then considered the petitioner's second objection, that the commander was at most permitted to destroy only the separate unit of the building where Fuad lived. The HCJ relied on the language of r.119 to resolve that the military commander may destroy any house \\" . . . the inhabitant or some of the inhabitants of which he is satisfied have committed\\"Alamarin, at ¬∂6 (alteration in original) (citation omitted) a violent offense under the Regulations.See Defence (Emergency) Regulations, 1945, r.59(b) The ruling relied on the HCJ's prior decision in Hizran v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip(holding that commander's authority under r.119 is broad and is not limited only to the residence of the guilty party, but \\"extends beyond this to the whole building (and even to the land), the inhabitants or some of the inhabitants of which have committed an offence\\"). The HCJ found no basis in \\"either the literal text or in the spirit\\" of the regulation to limit the commander's authority under r.119.. Proportionality Although construed broadly, the HCJ maintained that the commander's authority under r.119 is limited by \\"reasonable discretion and a sense of proportion.\\" Justice Bach proceeded to explain that the HCJ holding \\"does not mean . . . that this court is not able or bound to intervene in the decision of the military authority, whenever the latter intends to exercise its authority in a way and manner that are unthinkable.\\" Alamarin, at ¬∂ 7. Critical Scholarship Israel's policy of home demolition in Palestine has spawned a voluminous body of scholarly work. Numerous law review articles have criticized the policy for being immoral, ineffective, contrary to Jewish morals and international law, and some have argued that it may amount to an international crime. Some scholars have argued that the Israeli High Court's jurisprudence in home demolitions cases like Alamarin is not in accordance with public international law.Harpaz, at 403. =Response to Criticism= Israel has argued that collective punishment is an effective deterrent against terrorism. Alan Dershowitz has said that all Palestinians who \\"passively support\\" terror attacks are guilty even if they do not provide any direct aid to the attackers. He argues that collective punishment is moral as long it is proportional to complicity.See, e.g., (arguing for a moral gravity requirement that would \\"exclude conducts such as Israel's house demolitions practice\\" from the Rome Statute's prohibition on collective punishment).

The show is a mixture of live action, animation, and puppets. Characters included Ernie, who sang a song about the letter M; Snorkee, a reptile who is often oblivious to his surroundings and lacks common sense; Maynard, an elderly man who laments over his wasted youth; and Piggle, a pig with a big appetite, among others. Production and release The series was directed and produced by John Horton and Mark V International and released by Televidics Productions. Most of the puppets were created by Dann O'Quinn, but volumes four through six also featured puppets created by Dave Chapman. Human characters included \\"The Story Lady\\" (played by Melody Knighton, who also assisted in the operations of some of the puppets) and \\"Magic Megan\\" (played by Deanna Hawkins). Additionally, animated segments were done by \\"Those Designers\\", Inc., and the music was composed by Tuesday Productions and John Horton. Most likely due to very poor sales, budget problems, and/or negative reviews, the series was cut short and was canceled sometime in 1988. By this point, the six volumes had already gone out of print. For at least 1990 and 1991, it was distributed to Low-Power TV stations by Enoki Films USA. Reception and inspiration Nick Antosca, creator and showrunner of SyFy's series Channel Zero, watched Peppermint Park and other \\"really creepy old children's TV shows\\" for inspiration for the puppet show in season one, Candle Cove (2016). American artist Andrew Norman Wilson remembered as a kid \\"being terrified of an unexplained dance sequence by a breakaway puppet dressed to look like a scarecrow.\\" But rewatching clips posted online a few years ago he said, \\"my relationship with the dancing scarecrow has shifted from horror to obsession.\\" He created Reality Models, an extended remake of that scene for a 2016 exhibit. Screen Rant included the series in a 2017 list of forgotten creepy kid's shows. They suggested it is the \\"uncanny valley\\" and \\"melancholy voice acting\\" which makes the episodes \\"unnerving\\". In 2019, Cracked.com included the series in a list of nightmarish children's characters.

Affiliates of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), namely the YPG/YPJ and local Arab tribes, attacked the settlement in an attempt to capture it from Jihadist and Islamist groups, led by the Al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. After four days of heavy fighting, the Islamists were defeated and expelled from al-Yaarubiyah.  Background  Anti-government protests in al- Yaarubiyah in January 2012 The Syrian Civil War reached al-Yaarubiyah in early 2013, when a group of locals formed Ahrar al-Jazeera and started an uprising against the government. These local rebels were not very successful until they were reinforced by the al-Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham, and Ghuraba al-Sham, who captured al-Yaarubiyah in March 2013. Soon thereafter the insurgents began to fight each other over control of the town. The rebels in al-Yaarubiyah only banded together again in July, as the conflict between Islamists and pro-PYD factions in the al-Hasakah Governorate escalated. From then on, Islamist forces used the town as important staging point for attacks against YPG-held areas. The YPG launched a general counter-offensive, code-named \\"Martyr √áekjin Efrin Revolutionary Operation\\", in early September, in course of which it captured several villages near al-Yaarubiyah. As the rebels in al-Yaarubiyah were forced on the defensive, Ahrar al-Jazeera fell out of favor with the other rebel groups, and was forcibly expelled from the town on charges that it was corrupt. As result, al-Yaarubiyah was left under the control of four Jihadi groups by October 2013: The al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Ansar al-Khilafa, and Liwa al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad. Both Ansar al-Khilafa and Liwa al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad consisted of local Islamists, though they were much weaker than ISIL/al-Nusra. In addition, Sky News Arabia reported that some Ahrar al-Sham fighters operated in the town. The Jihadist rule of al-Yaarubiyah was harsh, as locals were forbidden from listening to music and forced to fast and pray, while dissidents were either imprisoned or beheaded. Food prices increased and fuel became scarce. In response to these policies and the fighting in the area, most of the town's population fled to YPG territories. Eventually, a delegation of 90 leading tribesmen from al- Yaarubiyah asked the YPG to drive the rebels from the town, to which the militia responded positively.  Battle  YPG fighters in 2013 The YPG and YPJ launched the offensive to conquer al-Yaarubiyah on 23 October, beginning with the \\"Tƒ±rbespiy√™\\" and \\"Til Elo Martyrs\\" operations, which aimed at securing the countryside around the town. By the next day, the Kurds and forces of the Shammar tribe, which were supported by local guides, had captured four villages and three hamlets surrounding al-Yaarubiyah. In the night of 25 October, the Kurdish militias finally began their three-pronged assault on the town's outskirts, first seizing two strategic villages. The local cement plant, which had served as rebel headquarters, was captured by YPG/YPJ forces during a second assault in the early hours of the next day, while the town's border crossing and another village fell to the Kurdish units around dawn. The YPG and YPJ then began their attack on al-Yaarubiyah itself, and in course of two days drove the Islamists from the town. The last pockets of resistance consisting of ISIL, al-Nusra Front, and Ahrar al-Sham holdouts were cleared out on 27 October. The YPG subsequently claimed that they had inflicted heavy casualties on the Islamists and captured five tanks, as well as large amounts of weapons and ammunition. After the town's fall, the Syrian rebels as well as the National Iraqi Alliance accused the Iraqi Army of having directly intervened in the battle on the side of the YPG/YPJ. There were also claims about strikes on the town by the Iraqi Air Force. Iraqi authorities strongly denied that any intervention had taken place, with expert Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi saying that there was \\"no evidence of active Iraqi military aid to the YPG\\". Instead, the Iraqi Army had simply reinforced their side of the border during the battle in an attempt to prevent ISIL fighters from retreating into Nineveh Governorate. Iraqi officials admitted, however, that wounded YPG fighters had received medical aid from the Iraqi Army.  Aftermath and reactions  The capture of al-Yaarubiyah was hailed as great success by the PYD, but was also welcomed by the Kurdish National Council, a local political opponent of the PYD. Similarly, Syrian pro-government media reported the defeat of the Islamist rebel forces at al-Yaarubiyah with satisfaction. The Syrian National Coalition, however, another Syrian opposition group and rival of the PYD, condemned the YPG for expelling the \\"Free Syrian Army\\" from the town, even though no FSA forces had been present during the battle. In contrast, the Ahrar al-Jazeera Brigade took an intermediate stance, and officially denounced the purported Iraqi invasion of al-Yaarubiyah, while at the same time trying to negotiate a power-sharing deal with the YPG. Meanwhile, the YPG continued to advance in the countryside around al-Yaarubiyah, and on 30 October managed to encircle the elements of Liwa al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad that had survived the battle at the town. As a result, much of the militia surrendered, even though it had declared shortly before that it would fight together with ISIL against the YPG until the very end. Some Liwa al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad fighters remained active, however, and joined a counter-attack by the al-Nusra Front, ISIL, and Ansar al-Khilafa in early November, which aimed at retaking al-Yaarubiyah. Although the Jihadists, supported by Ahrar al-Sham, managed to advance into the town's outskirts, the attack ultimately failed. In the following weeks al-Yaarubiyah was rebuilt, and on 22 November 2013 many of its civilian residents returned. Opposition activists claimed, however, that thousands of other local Arabs had fled from the region rather than stay under PYD rule.

His parents died at young age, and he was educated by his uncle the reverend Eugenius Rubens.  Career  He entered Hemiksem Abbey in 1693 and took his vows. After his ordination he studied in Louvain in the College of the Order. In 1722 he was elected Abbot and followed to Cornelius Addriaenssens as Abbot of Hemiksem Abbey. His arms are the ones of the House of Rubens and his Motto was in Pace et equitate. He took a seat of the States of Brabant, though his political influence was not important. The archduchess, however, sent him to Orval Abbey to fight Jansenism, which was considered as a major problem. During the period of his abbacy, the abbey acquired many important grounds and the abbey managed to grow to an important economic institution. With this financial capital, the abbot spent important sums to the decoration of the abbey church and the abbey library.

Logan by sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Alexander Phimister Proctor, in a setting by architect Stanford White. Installed in Chicago's Grant Park, in the U.S. state of Illinois, the statue and pedestal sit atop a memorial mound, with a ceremonial stairway leading to the summit. History The monument was created during 1894‚Äì1897 and dedicated on July 22, 1897. Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company served as the founder, and additional assistance was provided by Daniel H. Burnham, Annette Johnson, and Mary Lawrence Tonetti. The unveiling of the memorial in 1897 was a major event in Chicago. People from across the country attended and the coverage was equally widespread. The dignitaries included Russell A. Alger, Secretary of War represented President McKinley, Governor James A. Mount of Indiana and Governor Silas A. Holcomb of Nebraska. Illinois Governor John Riley Tanner accepted the memorial on behalf of the state of Illinois and an oration was delivered by George R. Peck. Three revenue cutters fired salutes on Lake Michigan and the memorial was unveiled by Logan‚Äôs grandson, seven-year-old John A. Logan III. In 1913, Eugene F. McDonald, a representative of the Anderson Electric Car Co. (and future founder of Zenith Radio Corporation) used the steps leading up the memorial to demonstrate the ability of a Detroit Electric to climb hills for one of his customers. He was arrested for the stunt but made the sale. In February 1923, the South Park commissioners in Chicago suggested that the Logan Memorial be taken off its mound and put on a pedestal. The mound contains a tomb intended for the General and his wife. Mrs. Logan fought the move, writing letters to the head of the commission. Civil War veterans rallied in support of Mrs. Logan. She died a little over a week later. The statue was never moved. General and Mrs. Logan were both buried at the U.S. Soldiers‚Äô and Airmen's Home National Cemetery in Washington, DC and have never been returned to Chicago. In 1939 it was reported that the inscription above the vault that read ‚ÄúWithin this crypt the mortal remains of the hero are buried‚Äù had been chipped away to just a handful of letters by vandals. In 1968, during the anti-war protests surrounding the Democratic National Convention, demonstrators climbed the statue and organizers spoke from in front of its base.

Attack At the time of the attack the town was under the control of Ahrar al-Sham.

The only known son of King Binnya E Law had a rival in his half-cousin Binnya U to be heir-apparent. He died of smallpox, and did not succeed his father as king. Brief Binnya E Laung was born to Prince Binnya E Law and a concubine in the 1320s. E Laung was probably born in Pegu (or less probably in Sittaung), the towns where his father was governor.Per (Pan Hla 2005: 42), E Law was governor of Sittaung and later Pegu prior to his accession as king in 1330. Given that E Laung was still young child, he was probably born in Pegu. He was a still a young child when his father brought him to the capital Martaban (Mottama).Pan Hla 2005: 42 His father had been summoned by Queen Sanda Min Hla to take over the throne. But E Law did not bring E Laung's mother, a concubine, to Martaban.According to the chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 42), E Law did not bring any concubines to Martaban because he was concerned that his half-sister and new chief queen Sanda Min Hla, who had engineered the deaths of the previous two kings, might get into a jealous rage. As a result, E Laung grew up without his biological mother. He was raised by a nanny named Hnin An May Han. Although he was the only son of E Law, the prince was not officially appointed as heir-apparent. E Laung had a rival in his half-cousin Binnya U, son of Sanda Min Hla. The king was careful not to antagonize his chief queen, and never officially announced who his heir was. The ambiguity disturbed E Laung. One day, he organized an attack on U's camp. The two princes fought on elephant-back, and E Laung was defeated. The king finally chose sides, and arrested U.Pan Hla 2005: 43 The king freed U only after intense protestations by queens Sanda Min Hla and Tala Shin Saw Bok, mother and aunt of U.Pan Hla 2005: 43‚Äì44 At any rate, E Laung died shortly after from smallpox.Pan Hla 2005: 44 Notes References Bibliography * Hanthawaddy dynasty Deaths from smallpox ","title":"Binnya E Laung"},{"id":"53726224","text":"Brice√±o (also anglicized as Briceno) may refer to: Places * Brice√±o, Antioquia, town and municipality in Antioquia Department, Colombia * Brice√±o, Boyac√°, town and municipality in Boyac√° Department, Colombia People * Alonso de Brice√±o (1587‚Äì1668), Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of Caracas * Antonio Brice√±o (born 1966), Venezuelan photographer and environmental activist * B√°rbara Brice√±o (born 1996), Peruvian volleyball player * Carlos Briceno (born 1967), American volleyball player * Daniel Brice√±o (disambiguation), multiple people, including: **Daniel Brice√±o (Colombian footballer) (born 1985), Colombian footballer **Daniel Brice√±o (Chilean footballer) (born 1982), Chilean footballer * Francisco Brice√±o (died 1571), Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of Almer√≠a * Germ√°n Brice√±o (born 1919), Venezuelan sports shooter * Humberto Brice√±o (born 1928), Venezuelan sports shooter * Johnny Brice√±o (born 1960), Belizean politician who served as leader of the People's United Party * Jos√© Gregorio Brice√±o (born 1965), Venezuelan politician * Lorena Brice√±o (born 1978), Argentine judoka * Luis de Brice√±o (fl. 1610s‚Äì1630s), Spanish guitarist and music theorist * Maria Briceno, Venezuelan road cyclist * Mario Brice√±o (born 1996), Chilean football winger * Mario Brice√±o Iragorry (1897‚Äì1958), Venezuelan intellectual and cultural analyst * Omar Brice√±o (born 1978), Mexican football defender * Oscar Brice√±o (born 1985), Colombian football forward * Rohel Brice√±o (born 1984), Venezuelan footballer * Thomas Brice√±o (born 1993), Chilean judoka * Ulices Brice√±o (born 1993), Mexican footballer * Gustavo Rangel Brice√±o (born 1956), Venezuelan military officer and minister of defense * Jorge Valero Brice√±o (born 1946), Venezuelan ambassador ","title":"Brice√±o"},{"id":"53726229","text":"Ragnar Arved Arvedson, (4 December 1895 ‚Äì 2 October 1973) was a Swedish actor, director, writer and producer.

On each side a pair of faired struts braced the spars to the lower fuselage longerons. Its overhung ailerons were aerodynamically balanced. The D.14 was powered by a Lorraine 12E Courlis W12 engine, water-cooled with a pair of Lamblin radiators. Part of the fuel was in wing tanks and part in the fuselage. The engine was enclosed under a closely fitted cowling which followed the three banks of cylinders. Behind the engine the fuselage had a rectangular cross-section defined by four longerons. The pilot's open cockpit, offset to port, was in the wing leading edge. The central, windowed part of the fuselage contained passengers and freight and was divided into three compartments. The forward one, under the wing, could either be given over to freight or contain two passenger seats. A central compartment provided four seats and the rearmost contained a toilet and had separate entry doors to the cabin and a baggage hold. The empennage was conventional with a swept, straight-edged tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and a triangular fin. Both rudder and elevator were balanced, the latter with overhung tips like those of the ailerons. The D.14 had conventional, fixed landing gear. A pair of V-struts, splayed slightly outwards, were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and supported a rigid axle, with the mainwheels apart. The forward components of the V-struts were telescopic, with shock absorbers and coil springs inside their streamlined fairings. Operational history The D.14 first appeared in public, still unflown, at the Paris Aero Salon held in December 1924. In January it was at Villacoublay, with trials scheduled to begin in the week starting 20 January. It had flown by 4 February 1925. In December 1925 the D.14 was about to start commercial trials with CIDNA, fitted with a Farman 12We W-12 engine. The following May it was tested at Toussus-le- Noble, its performance reported as \\"much improved\\" because the geared-down Farman engine had allowed a larger diameter propeller to be fitted. In August 1926 it was at Villacoublay, still with this engine, now reported as delivering .

Early years Volokhonsky was born in Leningrad and graduated from university with a degree in chemistry. In 1973, he emigrated to Israel and then moved to Germany in 1985. Between 1985 and 1995, Volokhonsky lived in Munich, where he worked for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and in 1995 he moved to T√ºbingen. His sister, Larissa Volokhonsky, eventually became a translator. Career Volokhonsky began writing poetry in the 1950s. He published several books of poetry, some of them together with Alexei Khvostenko. Most of the poetry is ironic and is considered to be descended from Oberiu. Perhaps his most famous piece was lyrics on \\"Canzona by Francesco da Milano\\", written by Vladimir Vavilov, the song called \\"The City of Gold\\" (). The song, in turn, would become a hit in the 1980s when it was performed by Aquarium for the soundtrack for the film Assa. Volokhonsky also worked with Leonid Fyodorov, the frontman of the Auktyon, and wrote texts for his albums. He also translated Catullus and fragments of Finnegans Wake by James Joyce into Russian. Death He died on 8 April 2017 in Rexingen, where he had lived since 2004.

It was discovered in May 2014 by astronomers at the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Arizona - a project of NASA's NEO (Near Earth Object) Observations Program in collaboration with the University of Arizona.  Orbit and classification  belongs to the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Apollos are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members. It is also a potentially hazardous asteroid due to its sufficiently large size (an absolute magnitude brighter than 22), and its Earth-MOID (see below) of less than 0.05 AU. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.25‚Äì3.90 AU once every 3 years (1,086 days; semi-major axis of 2.07 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.89 and an inclination of 25¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. This makes it also a Venus- and Mercury- crossing asteroid. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Pan-STARRS in May 2011, or 3 years prior to its official first observation at Mount Lemmon. = Close approaches = This asteroid has a minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of , which translates into 4.3 lunar distances.  2017 Earth flyby  made a close flyby of Earth on 19 April 2017, and at its closest approach on that date came within 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) of the planet.

In 2014, further research based on NEOWISE data indicated an object of 650 m in diameter and albedo 0.25.https://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/2014JO25/2014JO25_planning.html Based on a generic magnitude-to-mean-diameter conversion, measures approximately 720 m in diameter, using an absolute magnitude of 18.1 and assuming an albedo of 0.20, which is typical for stony asteroids. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 818 meters based on an absolute magnitude of 17.8. Observation of the asteroid with the Goldstone Solar System Radar were performed between April 15 and 21, 2017 by Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar. Results show that the largest dimension of this contact binary is at least 870 meters. = Rotation period = The 2017 radiometric observations at Arecibo and Goldstone also gave a rotation period of approximately 4.5 hours. Also in April 2017, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station () in California.

Usually an older person plays with a younger one (mostly a child), with the child sitting on the older person's lap.  Example  In the German language the following 'Kniereitvers' (Hoppe, hoppe Reiter) is most popular (here translated into English): Hop hop rider, when he falls then he will cry, If he falls into the ditch, the crows will eat him. If he falls into the swamp the rider will go plop! There are verses that have one or more lines added, for example: Hop hop rider, when he falls then he will cry. If he falls into the ditch, the crows will eat him. If he falls into the hedge, the snails will eat him. If he falls into the green grass, he will get wet. If he falls into the water, he will get even wetter. If he falls onto the stones, his legs will hurt. If he falls into the swamp, the rider will go plop! There are also versions in different dialects, depending on the area in Germany. Accompanying actions While playing and reciting the verses, the child sits on a parent's knees or lap facing the parent. The parent moves the knees up and down, imitating riding a horse. The parent holds on to the child's hands imitating holding reins. When it comes to the part where the parent says \\"the rider will go plop\\" the parent opens the legs or knees so that the child slips down towards the floor while holding hands the entire time. The parent will then pull the child back onto the lap. This little acting game is a lot of fun for the child, anticipating the 'fall' from the 'horse' and being saved by the parent, staying safe and sound.

History The citadel was designed by the Italian engineer Francesco Paciotto and built on the orders of the Duke of Alva. Initial construction was completed in 1572. After the Sack of Antwerp (1576) the citizens partially demolished the fortification, but it was reconstructed after the Fall of Antwerp (1585). The citadel saw action towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when it was defended by diehard Bonapartists. The Siege of Antwerp (1814) continued for a month after Napoleon's abdication. After the Belgian Revolution of 1830, Dutch forces remained in control of the citadel until the Siege of Antwerp (1832). Demolition began in 1874 and was completed in 1881.Piet Lombaerde, Antwerpen versterkt (University Press Antwerp, 2009), pp. 127-133.

In 1914, he graduated from the Teacher's Seminary in Lviv. He was a Ukrainian storywriter and playwright who moved for a time from Europe to North America, and continued to write about his European experiences while in the new world. He was also editor of a number of publications in Europe and Canada.  Ukrainian Civil War  The first story he wrote was at the age of 17 entitled Meeting (–ó—É—Å—Ç—Ä—ñ—á) using the penname Irchan. His first collection of sketches and short stories was titled Nirvana‚Äôs Laughter (–°–º—ñ—Ö –ù—ñ—Ä–≤–∞–Ω–∏), a condemnation of war. He became a soldier in the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen and the Ukrainian Galician Army shortly after the outbreak of World War I. He fought in three different armies:Austro-Hungarian, Galician, and the Red Army of Ukraine.Krawchuk, Peter, The Unforgettable Myroslav Irchan. Translated by Mary Skrypnyk. Kobzar Publishing Company Ltd. , Edmonton, Alberta 1998. When he ended up in the ranks of the Red Ukrainian Galician Army, he edited its periodical Red Archer (–ß–µ—Ä–≤–æ–Ω–∏–π –°—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Ü). He wrote two plays about the Ukrainian Civil War in the middle of the war.Balan, Jars. The Ukrainian Canadian stage, in Slavic Drama. University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada 1991, page 228. The first of these plays was The Rebel (–ë—É–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä), begun in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War in April 1920, and completed January 12, 1921 in Uman. It received 26 performances in eight months throughout Kyiv Oblast and Podolia. Printed by Kultura publishers in 1922, 3,000 of its 10,000 copies were distributed in North America. It is set in a Galician city early in 1920, as the Red Army offensive against Poland was stalling, and tells of a failed insurrection organized by pro-Soviet Ukrainian activists in the workers movement. Married Life Following the end of the civil war, Irchan settled in Kyiv where he met and married his wife Zdenka. She was the daughter of a Czech doctor, and when her parents returned to Prague in 1922, the young couple followed them. In Prague, Irchan enrolled at Charles University and participated in Ukrainian student activities. He was well known as a writer by this time, and continued to publish articles and stories, some of which were printed in North America. Canada In 1923, Irchan was invited to come to Canada through ULTA (Ukrainian Labour Temple Association) to edit their journal Working Woman (–†–æ–±—ñ—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü—è), to which he had already contributed articles. At this time Canadian Immigration only accepted immigrants as labourers, so he and his wife were invited to come to Canada by a Canadian farmer, in Gonor, Manitoba, where they lived for a time and he continued his literary activities. Drama In Canada, he was to experience the most creative literary period of his life, as editor, poet, storywriter, and playwright. The first play he wrote in Canada was The Family of Brushmakers (–†–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ —â—ñ—Ç–∫–∞—Ä—ñ–≤). In all cases where the drama of the doubting and confused mind is Irchan's interest, his work takes on a rich texture and offers many possible readings and many complex interpretations. The Family of Brushmakers, in four acts, written between 1923‚Äì24, tells the story of a family of four people ‚Äì three of whom at the outset of the play are blind. Only the son can see. In Irchan's own words, ‚ÄúIn 1915, while I was lying ill in a German hospital in the Austrian capital Vienna, I read in a German newspaper a story in a small corner of its last page that a blind brushmaker and musician living in Germany had a blind wife and daughter. His only son, who had vision, was conscripted into the German army. In time, the son returned home, but to the glory of the Kaiser and the great German Empire, he had given up his eyesight. He had lost it during a poisonous attack at the front. So the only member of the family with sight, the son, was now blind in a blind family.‚Äù The play was a great success, staged 74 times from Montreal to Vancouver, and even the English Press had something to say about this ‚Äúdangerous production‚Äù. Myroslav Irchan (seated), as the son, in his play A Family of Brushmakers Departure The reasons for his departure from Canada are manifold. First, his wife Zdenka who was in poor health, with their daughter, Maya, returned to her parents in Prague. Secondly, the organizational activities which entangled him more and more with ULTA in Winnipeg left him little opportunity to develop as a writer. Finally, some of the membership of ULTA may have encountered problems with his work, possibly finding it too much that of the expression of an individual rather than of their organization. Whatever the reasons, on May 22, 1929, he left Winnipeg on his journey back to Europe. Tragic Fate Irchan returned to Ukraine at a time when Stalin‚Äôs repression of artists, academics, and gifted individuals in all fields was intensifying. Irchan moved to Kharkiv, at that time the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city had writers‚Äô organizations and publishers, and he had friends here in the writing community. In 1934, he was one of many writers arrested by the State Political Administration. His wife and daughter joined him in Omsk, Siberia, though it is unclear whether Zdenka did this voluntarily. In a letter she wrote to a friend in Winnipeg, she says, ‚ÄúPlease do not send me anymore newspapers, and notify New York to do the same thing, because they are causing me unpleasantness. Some day I will write more. Greetings to all. Zdenka.‚Äù But nothing more was heard. Thirty- four years after Irchan's official rehabilitation in the Soviet Union, which was the result of Khrushchev's report revealing the criminal activity under Stalin's direction, the detail of Irchan's fate was made public. Irchan was interrogated by Pavel Postyshev who is considered to be one of the principal architects of the famine of 1932‚Äì1933, known in Ukraine as Holodomor. Irchan was accused of ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù to the nationalist Ukrainian counter-revolutionary organization, which worked to overthrow Soviet rule in Ukraine by military means. It now seems he was shot with so many other Ukrainian intellectuals on 3 November 1937 at Sandarmokh in Karelia. References Bibliography * Balan, Jars. The Ukrainian Canadian stage, in Slavic Drama.

Japan's netlabel phenomenon was the first time in the history of the nation's music industry where underground musicians could produce their works however they wanted to and have their music noticed by the public; this is an aspect that was previously absent at a time when major labels in the country followed a conservative method where they managed how artists would produce their music. Starting in the 2010s, the netlabel scene has crossed over to the mainstream music landscape and all across the world, with netlabel producers transitioning into working for bigger labels and western producers like Cashmere Cat and Ryan Hemsworth being influenced by the music of Japanese netlabels. History and notable labels =Background and Minus N= Ryosuke Hidaka estimated that Netlabels began increasing publicity outside Japan around 1999 and 2000.St. Michel, Patrick (March 18, 2013). \\"Not All Imprints Make CDs ‚Äì Enter the Netlabel\\". MTV 81. Viacom. Retrieved April 6, 2017. Minus N was the first netlabel to be based in Japan, forming in 2003. While Minus N set the model of distribution of Japan's netlabel community in that every release was issued for free online, it garnered the most attraction from Western territories due to acts from all across the world on the label. =Maltine Records= Maltine Records is one of the most popular imprints in the netlabel scene of Japan. There have been more than 130 releases under the label as of December 2014. In 2005, high school freshmen Tomohiro Konuta, also known as Tomad, and Syem, his real name not revealed, formed the electronic dance music netlabel Maltine Records as a way to distribute their music. Konuta explained, \\"During that time, there were a lot of internet labels starting to pop up overseas, and people uploading their music online for free‚Äîthis influenced me and gave me the idea to start Maltine.\\" With Maltine, the two also released tracks from artists they found on internet bulletin boards and services such as 2chan and Myspace. In the words of journalist Patrick St. Michel, the label gained attention due to \\"a combination of reoccurring musicians and one-off releases.\\"St. Michel, Patrick (May 19, 2011). \\"Online Maltine learns old-school tricks\\". The Japan Times. Retrieved April 9, 2017. Starting in the early 2010s, Maltine has used methods to spread their music around to those who don't have computer internet access; this included making and releasing the compilation album MP3 Killed The CD Star? (2010) on CD and a free iPhone application for listening to music by the netlabel. Maltine has crossed over into the mainstream ever since the 2010s.Harwood, Nick (June 30, 2014). \\"Meet the Man Behind Ryan Hemsworth‚Äôs Favorite Tokyo Label, Maltine Records\\". The Fader. Retrieved April 9, 2017. In 2013, Maltine collaborated with Tokyo Girls' Style for its producers such as tofubeats, Avec Avec and okadada to create remixes of songs by the girl group in what was titled Maltine Girls‚Äô Wave. The Fader described the project as \\"wonderfully weird fusion of corporate-sponsored pop and quirky internet funk.\\" Maltine's music has served as stylistic influences for the works of Western artists such as Cashmere Cat and Ryan Hemsworth; Hemsworth has featured Maltine's music on the mixes and live sets. According to St. Michel, almost every track Maltine releases are dance music re-interpretations of J-pop: \\"None of the songs scattered across Maltine‚Äôs website resemble AKB48, but rather are a re-imagining of Japanese mainstream pop created for the dance floor rather than an ice-cream commercial.\\" Maltine began releasing breakbeat and gabber tracks before they expanded to releasing music of various styles such as synthpop, house music, drum 'n' bass, techno, ambient music, 2-step, jersey club, indie pop and rap. St. Michel wrote that most Matline releases are \\"strange\\" takes on the way electronic dance and pop music is made; for instance, several music released by the netlabel contain anime and video game samples over \\"normal\\" dance instrumentals, thus creating \\"faster releases imagining a world where Aphex Twin really liked Sailor Moon and decided to incorporate it into his music.\\" A track by Maltine regular contributor Gassyoh is a house song featuring samples from the role-playing video game EarthBound (1994). =Bunkai-Kei Records= Bunkai-Kei Records is an ambient and glitch music netlabel that is also one of the biggest imprints in the Japan netlabel scene. The netlabel had been around a few years before Maltine began, but did not start gaining attention until after the popularity of Maltine. One of their releases is a record by Vocaloid musician kz. Their later works included singing from vocalists such as Tokyo singer Smany, pornographic actress Yura Sakura, and Brooklyn-based singer Abigail Press. =Bump Foot= Formed in 2005, the netlabel Bump Foot release two types of records: \\"Bump House,\\" which issues techno and house albums, and ‚ÄúFoot Side,‚Äù which is for \\"music meant to be absorbed,\\" as St. Michel wrote. Bump Foot has the most releases out of all the Japanese netlabels (More than 400 as of December 2014), and also features the highest number of non-Japanese artists. =MarginalRec.= The Tokyo netlabel MarginalRec. has released what St. Michel described to range \\"from remixes of popular J-pop songs, to anthemic floor fillers, to fidgety built- for-headphones numbers.\\" He cited it as an \\"essential\\" to the Japan netlabel community for its heavy focus on live nightclub events known as Another Weekender, which are also streamed to the internet via Ustream. =ALTEMA Records= ALTEMA Records has issued music in a variety of electronic music genres, including brostep, intelligent dance music and tracks featuring samples of sounds from 1990s computer programs. St. Michel spotlighted the netlabel's heavy emphasis on anime, with many of the cover arts including cute anime drawings. He noted ALTEMA's aesthetic as an example of the obsession towards anime art that is commonplace in Japanese netlabels. =Trekkie Trax= The netlabel Trekkie Trax originated as a party titled \\"Under 20\\" that took place in the Akihabara area of Tokyo. It soon transformed into an online label that issued dance music touching on genres such as juke house, 2-step, brostep, and grime-influenced dub music.

The law ended in 2015. =Otherman Records= Otherman Records is a breakcore netlabel that began in 2010 and have released works with elements of chiptune and drum'n'bass. It has released the harshest-sounding music that has been a part of the netlabel scene. =Indie netlabels= While a majority of music that comes out of the Japan netlabel landscape is based on electronic dance music, there have also been Japanese netlabels that have mainly issued indie pop and rock music. Canata Records Formed in November 2011 by producers Azusa Suga and Yoshiki Iwasawa, Canata Records is a Tokyo-based label for bedroom musicians from around the world. Iwasawa was inspired to start an indie label following a conversation with a book store buyer who suggested there was going to be an indie revival in Japan, a \\"third Summer of Love\\" that would be ‚Äúpartly influenced by Japanese indie music and anime culture.‚Äù Thus, the works of Canata include aspects of anime series and indie music. Canata's music has touched on styles such as shoegaze, indie pop, Vocaloid rock and, in the words of St. Michel, \\"nostalgic, sample-heavy\\" chillwave and vaporwave works by founder Azusa Suga. St. Michel noted the label's \\"weird\\" experimentation of the indie pop genre; an example would be its first releases by the groups Mane Laundering and The Hatsune Mikus, who works combined Vocaloid singing with indie and twee-pop elements. Ano(t)raks The label Ano(t)raks began on July 1, 2012 by Dai Ogasawara, also known by the moniker Twangy Twangy, and focuses on guitar- heavy twee pop inspired by the works of Sarah Records.St. Michel, Patrick (October 25, 2012). \\"Netlabels Ano(t)raks and Canata Records give the old DIY spirit a go with some new tools\\". The Japan Times. Nifco. Retrieved April 8, 2017. The name of the label is a play on the word anorak, clothing that is often associated with most indie-pop artists from the United Kingdom. Ogasawara formed Ano(t)raks out of desire to release music with the groups The Paellas and Post Modern Team that he first met via Bandcamp. Ano(t)raks' first release was an extended play by The Paellas. On September 14, 2012, they released what St. Michel described as \\"the best snapshots\\" of Japan's indie scene, a compilation album titled Soon V.A. which features music from indie acts throughout the country, such as Old Lacy Bed from Nagoya and Homecomings from Kyoto.\\"Soon V.A.\\". Ano(t)raks Official Bandcamp. Retrieved April 9, 2017. The album received attention from music blogs across the world, and led to some of the bands featured on the record gaining gig opportunities according to Ogasawara. Ano(t)raks is cited as one of the few labels to increase the popularity of indie pop in Japan in 2012. Homecomings and the Paellas, two acts formerly from the netlabel, have gone to become part of major labels. =Tanukineiri Records= Tanukineiri Records is a Japanese netlabel that St. Michel highlighted for its lack of stylistic \\"identity\\" uncommon in the scene. Their styles range from four-on-the-floor dance music to folk music to experimental lo-fi music to Indonesian indie pop. While most of their music is issued for free online like all the other Japanese netlabels, they've also released some works on compact disc. Origins and impact Kill Screen writer Caty McCarthy summarized that the ability to create whatever music an artist wanted to in Japanese netlabels was \\"welcome in a music scene where cookie- cutter idol groups are common, and diversity among their style is rare.\\" She categorized Japan's netlabel scene as a counterculture against the nation's major labels who would've otherwise not allowed how producers in the netlabel community made their work: \\"For largely the first time, underground musicians were given the voices and agency they so desperately desired.\\"McCarthy, Caty (January 28, 2016). \\"Pop, politics, and everything in between: the virtual families of netlabels\\". Kill Screen. Archived from the original on May 27, 2016. Retrieved April 10, 2017. She also highlighted the Japan netlabel landscape to have more of an \\"actual, tangible community\\" than netlabel scenes in other territories, noting it to have \\"grandiose roster-wide celebrations\\" and \\"subterranean bass-heavy parties.\\" As St. MIchel wrote, \\"the most influential Japanese netlabels have already helped shepherd a new generation of producers to greater awareness while shaping the future of popular Japanese music.\\"St. Michel, Patrick (December 3, 2014). \\"10 Essential Japanese Netlabels\\". Pitchfork. Conde Nast. Retrieved April 8, 2017. In a March 2013 interview, Hikada said that around 2008, there were approximately 20 netlabels located in Japan; he saids that the amount rose to around 150 five years later. An attribute to the success of Japanese netlabels is the popularity of social networking services like Facebook and Twitter that the imprints use to promote new artists and releases. Hikada marks this social network element of the scene to also come into play into live performances that are a part of the community. As St. Michel explained, \\"Hikada says party goers spend a lot of time tweeting at these nights, using hashtags to keep up with everyone else there and using the social-media site to toast one another. At one Maltine party in 2012, a large swath of attendees brought laptops with them, and many live-streamed themselves dancing on the floor‚Ä¶to others in the same room.\\" In the 2010s, the scene started to cross over in the mainstream. Netlabel musicians that transitioned in working for mainstream labels include Avec Avec, Yoshino Yoshikawa, tofubeats and Fazerock; tofubeats became a solo act for Warner Bros. Japan, collaborating with American singer Liz and providing a mix for the radio series Diplo and Friends. However, in a December 2014 feature, St. Michel also wrote that many Japanese netlabels have very short lifespans: \\"browsing the ‚Äúlinks‚Äù pages of still-thriving netlabels leads to lots of 404 errors or domain-for-sale pages. Minus N's site is now riddled with script mistakes.\\" Live performances There are very few netlabels in Japan that have the budget to set up and hold live events. However, all of the live events that have occurred have been successful, St. Michel analyzed. In December 2012, the Tokyo nightclub Womb held \\"an all-netlabel party\\" featuring acts from netlabels such as Maltine, Bunkai-Kei, No Disco and On Sunday Recordings.

They play at Lystrup Idr√¶tsanl√¶g in Lystrup, East Jutland. History = Founding and early decades = Lystrup Idr√¶tsforening was founded on 10 February 1934. However, there is some uncertainty about the exact date, which may ascribed to the fact that other sports activities were exerted in the area before that year. In the 1920s, two clubs were located in the area: Lystrup-Elsted Idr√¶tsforening and Lystrup Boldklub, who would both be disbanded. Co-founder and first chairman of Lystrup Idr√¶tsforening, or Lystrup IF in short, was N.J. Nielsen. During the first years of existence, association football was the only sports department in the club, but gymnastics and badminton would soon join. In the 1930s, the club at one point changed its name to \\"L.B.\\", either referring to a \\"Lystrup Boldklub\\" or \\"Lystrup Badmintonklub\\". Until 1950, Lystrup IF had its training facilities on the fields surrounding the town, after which grass pitches were installed. In 1969, another pitch and a clubhouse were constructed by Lystrup Enge, which provided a new home ground for the club. A gym, Lystruphallen, was built in 1973, and in the following year Lisbjerg IF joined Lystrup IF. = Recent years = In 2013‚Äì14, Lystrup IF reached promotion to the Denmark Series, the fourth highest level of Danish football. The following season, the club reached the third round of the Danish Cup, in which they were knocked out by Danish Superliga club AaB, after forfeiting their home advantage. The match ended 0-4.  Smukfest incident (2019)  In August 2019, Lystrup IF reached national Danish media following an incident, which involved first-team players attending Smukfest, an annual music festival, meaning that Lystrup were forced to forfeit their Danish Cup matchup against Skive IK. After facing pressure from Divisionsforeningen, representing the Danish divisions, and criticism from Skive's director of football, Rasmus Brandhof, Lystrup head coach John Stoltze Madsen stated that he simply did not have enough players available to compete. Club chairman Susanne Pedersen later explained that Smukfest was not the reason for players cancelling the cup match, but that the main reason was the club's relegation from the Denmark Series to the Jutland Series, which had seen many players leave the club during the summer. The following day, Lystrup announced that a mixture of first-team and veteran's team footballers could form a competitive team, which meant that cancellation was avoided. The match was played on 8 August, and ended in a 16-1 loss to Lystrup. It is tied with BK Pioneren's 1-16 defeat by Br√∏ndby IF in 1982 as the biggest defeat ever in the Danish Cup.

She was one of the founders of the Western Association of Writers, and served as its secretary from its organization until June 1888, when she retired. She wrote much in both verse and prose, but she never published her works in book form, and little of her work has been preserved. Early years and education Mary Louise Newland (later Marie) was born in Bedford, Indiana, on October 31, 1849. She was the second daughter of Dr. Benjamin Franklin Newland (1821‚Äì1889) and Louisa Ann (Curry) Newland, who were educated and considered to be intellectuals. Her early life was spent in Bedford, where she was mainly educated in private schools. She was a student at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, in St. Agnes' Hall, Terre Haute, Indiana, and at Hungerford Collegiate Institute, Adams, New York, which was destroyed by fire shortly before commencement, so that Andrews was not formally graduated. Andrews spoke French and German, and was familiar with Latin and modern language literature. Career In the winter of 1885‚Äì86, while working as an editor at the Indianapolis Herald, Andrews and other contributors to the paper, including John C. Ochiltree, Dr. James Newton Matthews, Richard Lew Dawson, and Dr. Henry William Taylor, became the founders of the Western Association of Writers movement, discussing the idea of a writers‚Äô association publicly through the Herald's columns. Andrews, a co-founder of the association, served as its secretary from its organization until June, 1888, when she retired from the office. Among her acquaintances were many of the prominent writers of the Western United States, and at the annual conventions of the association, she was always a conspicuous member. She was also remembered as a brilliant conversationalist and an effective impromptu speaker. The Western Association of Writers owed its organization and establishment largely to Andrews' indefatigable efforts. Andrews was not an author in the technical sense of having written a book, yet she gained a well- merited reputation as a ready and versatile writer of poems, essays, and sketches, contributing to various periodical publications. Her interest in literary work was much broader than a purely personal matter. The development of western literature, and its recognition by the country and the world at large, had been on her mind for some time before she was given the opportunity to demonstrate the practicability of her ideas in the association with which her name was closely identified. She foresaw the growth of literature in the west, and her ideas regarding that growth and of the best means of fostering it were embodied in the association. It served as a means of introducing scores of talented writers to the public. She was one of the most active promoters of the organization in its inception, and was one of its most steadfast friends through the years when its continuance seemed questionable. Personal life On May 15, 1875, she married Albert M. Andrews, then of North Vernon, Indiana. Soon afterwards, they moved to Connersville, Indiana where he worked in the pharmaceutical business. She was in Indianapolis for several winters, supervising the education of her son, Albert Charlton Andrews, who was her only child. Andrews died at Connersville on February 7, 1891.

Its name is corrupted from the Sicilian or Italian word guardia, meaning to watch). Although the name of the hamlet has Arabic lexicons, it was probably named later when Maltese, then an Arabic dialect, remained a dominant language. The hamlet is bordered with Bidnija, Buƒ°ibba, San Martin and Pwales. Several archeological remains are found in the whereabouts, proving that it was inhabited in pre-history and the Roman period, and it has always been mainly a rural village. From the 16th till the 18th-centuries it saw a shift into a hunting zone with the construction of several hunting lodges and chapels. A number of knights and noble families built their country residences, originally to be used for hunting and retreats. A number of 19th and 20th century structures were also erected in the area. Some houses are still owned by the descendants of the original builders, while others are now used for multiple purposes such as private homes, commercial accommodation, events and weddings receptions. There are two schools, one for local students and one for foreign students. There are a number of public and private chapels dating from the rule of the Order of St. John till the 20th century. Some houses have buttressed walls, possibly for defense purposes or general support, while other have defense features exclusively for decorative intent. A World War I battery was constructed in the whereabouts of Wardija, and its gun emplacements are still on site. A rental complex, known as the Wardija Hilltop Village, and the Headquarters of the Ecumenical Order, known as Castello Dei Baroni, are located at the inner part of Wardija. Wardija consist of a low and high land, its hill is a plateau, and Qannotta Valley is located within its boundaries. Rain water in Wardija is vital for agriculture, as a primary source of production, while it also flows into areas around such as to the now defunct Xemxija Aqueduct.

The first recorded emigration of Ryukyuans was in the 15th century when they established an exclave in Fuzhou in Ming Dynasty (China). Later, there was a large wave of emigration to Hawaii at the start of the 20th century, followed by a wave to various Pacific islands in the 1920s and multiple migrations to the Americas throughout the 20th century. Ryukyuans became Japanese citizens when Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1879; therefore Ryukyuan immigrants are often labeled as part of the Japanese diaspora. Regardless, much of the Ryukyuan diaspora views themselves as a distinct group from the Japanese (Yamato).  History  After Japan (Meiji era) legalized emigration from Okinawa Prefecture, thousands of Ryukyuans started to settle in other countries. The first group of Okinawan emigrants arrived to Hawaii on January 8, 1900 under the leadership of Kyuzo Toyama, who is often referred to as ‚Äúthe father of Okinawan emigration‚Äù. Today, there are 45,000 - 50,000 Hawai ªi residents of Ryukyuan ancestry, totaling around 3% of the state‚Äôs population. Brazil received its first migrants from Japan at the port of S√£o Paulo on June 18, 1908. Half of these migrants were from Okinawa Prefecture, despite Okinawa having less than 2% of Japan‚Äôs total population.

She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1907, and died in New York in July 1994 of leukemia. She studied ballet with Jenny Moller and teachers from the Royal Danish Ballet. Her schooling was at the Institute Jeanne d'Arc, Denmark.  Personal life and education  She moved to Paris as a young woman to study ballet with the famed Russian ballerina and teacher, Olga Preobrajenska. It was in her studio that she met her future husband and dancing partner, Vladimir Dokoudovsky, son of Count Dokoudovsky of Tula, Russia. Her partner in later years was the danseur, Kenneth MacKenzie, whom she met while on tour together in the Original Ballets Russes. Her daughter with Vladimir Dokoudovsky, Ludmila Dokoudovsky, was directress of the St. Louis Ballet Company, along with her husband, Antoni Zalewski.  Career  She began her career in the season of 1935-36 as Ballerina with Ballet Russe de l'Opera Comique of Paris. She was then hired as Ballerina with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo by Leonid Massine and Rene Blum, who then dubbed her, Nina \\"Stroganova\\" while dining in a restaurant together. She came to the United States in 1937, along with her husband, V. Dokoudovsky, to be Ballerina in the Mordkin Ballet company, with whom she danced notably in Peter and the Wolf, until 1940, when fellow dancer Lucia Chase hired her to be Prima Ballerina with her new company, Ballet Theatre, later known as American Ballet Theatre. With World War II threatening the lives of male dancers, Nina and Vladimir joined the Original Ballet Russe company of Colonel de Basil, which toured Latin America throughout the war years, to keep the male dancers from being drafted. After the war, Nina and Vladimir settled in New York City. She performed as a guest artist at the Royal Danish Ballet, along with her husband, in Giselle and Swan Lake, Act II. She also performed as a guest ballerina with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1950-51. She and her husband headed the Stroganova-Dokoudovsky Ballet Company in performances including at Jacob's Pillow, where the ballet The Abyss featuring a commissioned score by Alexander Tcherepnin was premiered. They joined the faculty of the renowned Ballet Arts school in Carnegie Hall, where they led classes crowded with luminaries of the dance world for many years. They later founded their own school, the New York Conservatory of Dance, now led by Patricia Heyes Dokoudovsky. Nina Stroganova also taught at School of Classical Ballet in Englewood, New Jersey, and after leaving the NY Conservatory, continued teaching noon classes at the studios of City Center Theater for a number of years until her sudden death at the age of 78. Students in Stroganova's noon classes included Alexandra Danilova, Eugene Collins, Gemze de Lappe, Bambi Linn, Agnes de Mille, Zizi Jeanmaire, Roland Petit, Nora Kovach, Istvan Rabovsky, Inge Sand, Toni Lander, Bruce Marks,Irina Lebedeva -¬ßhttp://liballetacademy.com LI Ballet Academy & Dance, Andrea Vodehnal, Michael Maule, Richard Marsden, Carl Corry, Daniel Baudendistel, Nicole Fox, Christine Dakin, Linda Giancaspro, Saul Davis, Charles Perrier, Diana Lasky, Trutti Gasparinetti, Marilyn D'Honau and other professional and amateur dancers.

It first aired on 21 February 2017, on BBC Two. The episode was written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, and was directed by Guillem Morales. \\"The Bill\\" focuses on four men‚ÄîArchie, Malcolm, Kevin, and Craig‚Äîarguing over who should pay the bill in a restaurant at closing time, much to the dismay of the waitress Anya. It addresses themes of masculinity and competition, and the English north‚Äìsouth divide is a recurring issue; Craig, the visiting southerner, is wealthier than the other three, and unfamiliar with some of their terminology. The episode was inspired by a real dispute seen by the writers, and also influenced by Yasmina Reza's play Art. \\"The Bill\\" starred Pemberton as Malcolm, Shearsmith as Archie, Jason Watkins as Kevin, Philip Glenister as Craig, and Ellie White as Anya. Callum Coates played Tim, who appears in the episode's final scene. Though set in northern England, the episode was filmed in a Hendon restaurant. Commentators compared the episode to the television series Hustle, the work of the director Quentin Tarantino‚Äîincluding his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs‚Äîand Roald Dahl's 1948 short story \\"Man from the South\\", which was adapted for both the television series Tales of the Unexpected and the 1995 anthology film Four Rooms. Critics responded positively to \\"The Bill\\", praising its humour, direction and acting. Glenister, Watkins, and White were all singled out for particularly compelling performances. Despite considerable praise for the writing and timing, some commentators questioned the effectiveness of a twist in the closing minutes, several criticising the final scene. \\"The Bill\\" won Shearsmith and Pemberton the Best TV Situation Comedy award at the 2018 Writers' Guild Awards. Production The second series of Inside No. 9 aired from 26 March 2015 to 29 April 2015, and in October the BBC confirmed a third series. Further information, including hints at settings and confirmed performers, was released in January 2016, around which time the series was filmed. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\", the first episode of this third series, was shown as a Christmas special on 26 December 2016 on BBC Two. \\"The Bill\\", the second episode of the third series and the first of a run of five episodes, followed a few months later, on 21 February 2017. =Writing and filming= Inspiration for \\"The Bill\\" came when Shearsmith and Pemberton, the creators of Inside No. 9, saw a group arguing over a bill at a Muswell Hill restaurant. The writers had an office in the area, and had lunch at the same restaurant every day while writing the programme's third series. The group was made up of three older people: two women and a man. Pemberton said that, unexpectedly, \\"they were arguing about wanting to pay it, and we just came out and thought, 'Could that be one episode?' ... And then it's about sustaining that one idea\\". For him, \\"when you're in the writing phase, you can see anything in day-to-day life that could spark your imagination\\"; after seeing this dispute, the writers immediately returned to their office to begin writing. Another inspiration, according to Shearsmith, was Yasmina Reza's play Art, which, like \\"The Bill\\", involves escalating arguments between friends. Richard Bean's stage version of the 1987 film House of Games, meanwhile, was identified by Shearsmith as sharing an \\"intensity\\" with the more violent moments of \\"The Bill\\". Much of the script was originally written prior to the decision to include the twists in the episode's closing minutes, and some parts that were written were not filmed. This included the characters playing a word-based drinking game with limoncello. Limoncello remained a part of the narrative, however, and formed the basis of a joke that was one of Shearsmith's favourites from the series: a quip that the thickly accented waitress was likely to bring a lemon and a cello rather than glasses of limoncello. For Pemberton and Shearsmith, the episode was particularly claustrophobic, and, in this sense, it mirrored \\"Sardines\\" and \\"La Couchette\\", the first episodes of the first and second series of Inside No. 9 respectively. The episode was filmed in a restaurant/nightclub in Hendon, London. The location, which was close to Pemberton and Shearsmith's homes, was found by the Inside No. 9 producer Adam Tandy. \\"The Bill\\" is set in the north of England at night; this introduced particular filming challenges. Takes had to be re-shot or edited if a London bus was visible out of the restaurant's windows, and some takes, including many of the character Craig (as his chair faced away from the restaurant's windows) could only be done later in the working day, otherwise daylight would be visible on-screen. =Cast= Philip Glenister (pictured, 2017) starred as Craig, a wealthy Londoner. As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"The Bill\\" starred Shearsmith as Archie, Pemberton as Malcolm, Jason Watkins as Kevin, Philip Glenister as Craig, Ellie White as Anya, and Callum Coates as Tim. For his role, Pemberton wore an Eddie Large-inspired wig, but had his own beard. He also wore padding to appear larger. Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith work hard to make roles attractive to accomplished actors, claiming that Glenister had hoped he would not like the script, looking for an excuse to turn down a week's work in his busy schedule. Pemberton and Glenister had known each other for many years prior to \\"The Bill\\"; they shared a mutual friend, and Glenister had appeared in productions for Pemberton's theatre company 606 Theatre. Glenister and Watkins, too, had worked together on a play read-through in the past. Prior to filming, Watkins had not met White, a less- well-known performer, who was sought out by Pemberton and Shearsmith due to her appearance in People Time, an acclaimed pilot that was shown as part of BBC Three's Comedy Feeds. Watkins had previously starred in Shearsmith and Pemberton's black comedy television programme Psychoville; the pair say that though they generally have a rule against \\"reusing\\" actors from Psychoville in Inside No. 9, so as \\"to keep surprising and avoid familiarity\\", they broke it \\"because [Watkins is] brilliant\\". He was not the only actor for which the writers broke this rule. Performers were also reused in \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" and \\"Cold Comfort\\", for example. Pemberton highlighted working with Watkins again as one of the highlights of the series. Watkins said he was attracted to Inside No. 9 by the chance to work with Pemberton and Shearsmith again. He described the episode as \\"like a beautifully constructed little play for television\\" with \\"a great mix of characters and surprising plots\\". His character, meanwhile, he called \\"put-upon and pathetic and petty\\". Plot Anya closes a restaurant where four men‚Äînortherners Archie, Malcolm, and Kevin are entertaining Londoner Craig‚Äîhave finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, but he and Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, Archie being unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin claims to be the poorest. Archie, Malcolm, and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. The dispute becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, and Malcolm reveals that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. Archie reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour. A distressed Malcolm leaves the table only to return furious; Archie was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists it is not about the bill, and fetches a knife and chopping board. Archie and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya's throat. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who will remove the body. The clean-up will cost ¬£200,000; it is needed tonight, in cash, meaning only Craig can pay. He calls his au pair, but treads on Anya's hand, and she yells. Kevin declares the plan a failure; Archie, Malcolm, Kevin, and Anya had been hustling Craig. Kevin, now in control, demands Craig's phone. Craig refuses, but is locked in the restaurant. In a final scene, a waiter closes the restaurant while the hustlers (\\"Archie\\", \\"Malcolm\\", \\"Kevin\\", and \\"Anya\\") entertain the well-dressed Tim. \\"Archie\\" requests the bill, and \\"the waiter\\" is revealed to be Craig, who has joined the hustlers to satiate his cravings for excitement. Analysis \\"The Bill\\" opens with the mundane image of men eating at a restaurant and arguing about the bill, but then, in the words of one critic, \\"takes that familiar scenario and pushes it to impressively baroque extremes\\". In a reversal of the norm, all diners want to pay the whole bill, rather than wanting to limit their payment. In this dispute, \\"The Bill\\" explores themes of masculinity, losing face, competitiveness, passive aggression, and rivalry. Andrew Billen, writing in The Times, compared this aspect of the episode to the television series Mad Dogs, which had also starred Glenister; one critic suggested that Glenister's character in Mad Dogs and Craig in \\"The Bill\\" are similar. The characters tell \\"well-rehearsed anecdotes and blokey jokes\\", while Craig is \\"all flash-cash and inappropriate comments to the waitress\\". Pemberton's Malcolm, for Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph, \\"appeared to have wandered in\\" from a Mike Leigh production; several critics commented on his striking hairpiece. All four of the men are unpleasant people. The English north‚Äìsouth divide is a key feature of the plot and humour, with many references to north‚Äìsouth caricatures. Craig is unfamiliar with the northern phrases used by Archie, Malcolm and Kevin, including diddlum, piss-mints, and bluecock (a \\"tight-fisted wanker\\"). Craig is wealthier than the other characters, and mocks them with stereotypes about northerners as poor and stupid. For one critic, the significance of the north‚Äìsouth divide in the episode means that it could have been called \\"Revenge of the Northerners\\". After the revelation in the closing minutes of \\"The Bill\\", the character of the episode changes. The biggest changes come about in Watkins's Kevin and White's Anya. Kevin changes from a timid penny pincher referred to as \\"the professor\\" apparently in jest to a menacing criminal mastermind. Anya, initially reminiscent of Manuel of Fawlty Towers or a character from 'Allo 'Allo!, faces criticism from her co-conspirators for taking her characterisation too far, allowing the writers, for one critic, to have their cake and eat it‚Äîany exaggerated characterisation is the fault of the character, not the writers. The script also acknowledge the plot's \\"silliness\\" in an almost-fourth-wall-breaking piece of dialogue, when Shearsmith's Archie declares that the characters' plan \\"was too elaborate\\". For one commentator, \\"The Bill\\" was the closest episode of Inside No. 9 to The League of Gentlemen, an earlier project of Shearsmith and Pemberton's, due to its use of gallows humour and back-and-forth dialogue. Critics also compared the episode to the television series Hustle, to the work of the director Quentin Tarantino‚Äîincluding the 1992 film Reservoir Dogs‚Äîand to Roald Dahl's 1948 short story \\"Man from the South\\". This latter story was adapted for the television series Tales of the Unexpected, a key influence on Inside No. 9 as a whole, and by Tarantino for the 1995 anthology film Four Rooms. Meanwhile, the premise was compared to that of \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", a 1991 episode of Seinfeld. Reception \\"The Bill\\" was generally positively received by critics, being given ratings of five out of five by Mike Ward of the Daily Express, four out of five by Hogan (The Daily Telegraph) and the freelance journalist Dan Owen, and three out of five by Andrew Billen of The Times. It was praised as \\"a tight, gloriously stressful half-hour\\", \\"hugely enjoyable\\", \\"an intricate, wonderfully well-executed tale\\", and \\"terrific fun\\". Mark Butler, writing for inews.co.uk, said that while there had been Inside No. 9 episodes \\"with greater atmosphere, invention or ideas\\", this episode, \\"as a 30-minute exercise in darkly comic suspense, ... did the trick\\". It was not, for Butler, among the best episodes; after the conclusion of the fourth series, he identified \\"The Bill\\" as the 20th best episode, out of 24. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau described \\"The Bill\\" as \\"quite a low-key opener for the series proper\\". Ian Hyland, writing in the Daily Mirror, considered \\"The Bill\\" a competitor with \\"The 12 Days of Christine\\" for the distinction of the best episode of Inside No. 9 ever. The episode was praised as genuinely funny, with a range of different kinds of humour. Praise was also directed at Morales, both Louisa Mellor (Den of Geek) and Owen commenting on his ability to give the impression of movement, even while the episode revolved mostly around four men sitting at a table. Critics commended the performances; Dessau called the cast \\"uniformly excellent\\", and Owen said that the script was \\"brilliantly performed\\". Ellen E Jones, writing for the London Evening Standard, praised both Glenister and Watkins; Hogan did likewise, but argued that Watkins \\"stealthily stole the show\\". Owen suggested that, in the episode, \\"Watkins again proved why he's one of the most underrated comic actors around right now\\". Mellor identified Watkins and White as offering the strongest performances. Hogan praised White for offering \\"estimable support\\", while Billen identified White as the performer who \\"stole the half-hour\\". The story, for Mellor, was strong; \\"the shocks have the intended impact and the whole half-hour works a treat\\". She commended the \\"good writing [and] excellent structure\\". Hogan considered the episode \\"ingeniously plotted\\", and Owen called it \\"delightfully written\\". The timing was also praised. Critics were less convinced by the revelation at the end of the episode; though Butler initially called it \\"satisfying and surprising\\", he later characterised \\"the overly-elaborate ending\\" as lowering the quality of the episode. The ending was criticised as lacking in meaning, and as \\"prosaically disappointing\\". For Billen, the reveal made the episode's premise \\"less interesting\\", and, for Owen, the characters were too quick to admit defeat. The final scene, in particular, was criticised, some commentators suggesting that, if thought about too much, it was not fully convincing; it was described as \\"arguably unnecessary\\" and as offering the episode's only \\"punch [that failed] to connect\\". =Writers' Guild Award= At the 2018 Writers' Guild Awards, administered by the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, Shearsmith and Pemberton won the Best TV Situation Comedy award for their work on \\"The Bill\\". The award was presented by Brenda Gilhooly. The other nominees were Daisy May Cooper and Charlie Cooper, the writers of This Country, and Simon Blackwell, for his work on Back.

A key faction the Pegu court led by Chief Minister Zeik-Bye opposed the Maha Dewi‚ÄìMaru faction, and they tried to undermine Maha Dewi's influence by publicizing the affair. At any rate, the Maha Dewi‚ÄìMaru faction was firmly in power by the early 1380s. By 1382, she was the de facto ruler.Pan Hla 2005: 81 Maru's end came in late 1383. In October, Maha Dewi, now in her official capacity as princess regent asked Maru and Zeik-Byet to lead the Pegu army to put down Prince Binnya Nwe's rebellion at Dagon.Pan Hla 2005: 129 However, Zeik-Bye secretly supported Nwe's rebellion, and provided intelligence to Nwe's camp. On 19 November, Maru's vanguard force was driven back.Pan Hla 2005: 154Fernquest Spring 2006: 6 After Binnya U's death on 2 January 1384, Maru tried to rally the court to put him on the throne. When he found no support, he and his wife tried to flee. But they were both captured. On 5 January 1384,The chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 158) says the coronation ceremony was held on Tuesday, 1st waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME, the day after the court had chosen Binnya Nwe as king. But 1st waxing is a typographical error. Per (Pan Hla 2005: 356, footnote 1), the Burmese language version of the chronicle states that Razadarit became king on Monday, 12th waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME (Monday, 4 Jan 1384). It means the coronation ceremony was held on Tuesday, 13th waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME (5 January 1384), and Maru died on that day. Binnya Nwe, who became king the day before, ordered Maru's immediate execution right before proceeding to his coronation ceremony.Pan Hla 2005: 160 (Maru's wife Thiri apparently escaped the execution. The chronicle does not say that the new king, who was about to take the title Razadarit, ordered the execution of his half-sister.)

She was the first woman elected to serve in the Latvian parliament. Active in women's rights, during her time in the Riga City Council and the Saeima, she strove to enact laws and policies to promote women's equality and protect families. When Soviet troops occupied Latvia, she was deported to Siberia, her life was removed from encyclopedias, and she died in a gulag. Early life Berta Ziemele was born on 28 September 1883 in the Code parish of the Russian Empire, in what is now the Baltic state of Latvia, to Liza (n√©e Kula) and Jekabs Ziemelis. Her parents worked a farm and ran an inn. Ziemele attended the Girls' Grammar School, a state operated primary facility in , before attending the Beƒ∑eris Girls‚Äô Preliminary Gymnasium in Bauska, which offered women four years of secondary schooling. Career In 1901, Ziemele began teaching in Kharkiv, now in Ukraine. Between 1904 and 1908, she studied in Berlin under Dr. Liebman to learn speech therapy techniques to assist disabled children. The following year, she traveled to Switzerland and Russia to expand her knowledge of educational systems. Returning to Latvia in 1910, Ziemele married Ermanis Pƒ´pi≈Ü≈°, (1873‚Äì1927), who was a book reviewer, journalist and literary critic. The couple subsequently had three children: daughters, Biruta and Nora and son, JƒÅnis. When Latvia gained its independence in 1918, Pƒ´pi≈Üa began active participation in social and political issues. She was one of the founders of the Democratic Center Party and was elected to serve on its Central Committee, the first woman elected to serve on a party's central governing body. In 1919, she was elected to the Riga City Council and began working on issues like public drinking and concerns focused around women and children. She was appointed to the Supply Commission and spoke at numerous events about women's issues. Around 1922, she joined the Latvian Women‚Äôs National League and that same year, the League joined the International Council of Women (ICW). In 1925, Pƒ´pi≈Üa became president of the League, which organized charitable work, such as founding a kindergarten, operating a library, establishing Sunday schools, and hosting educational and needlework courses for women. The organization also provided free legal advice to women, which Pƒ´pi≈Üa believed was part of the organizational goal of uniting women, educating them to bring up succeeding generations and helping them develop a national spirit. Between 1925 and 1928, Pƒ´pi≈Üa headed the Riga Department for the Destitute and then until 1931 served on the Riga Audit Commission, which monitored the municipal offices. She began publishing in 1928, with a piece, KƒÅ es runƒÅju ar saviem bƒìrniem par dzimumdzƒ´vi (How to talk to my children about sexuality), which was intended to help women educate their children. In 1930, she was involved in founding the Council of Latvian Women‚Äôs Organizations, an umbrella organization to advance the social and political equality of women. She served on its board and was appointed as the organization's leader. In 1931, Pƒ´pi≈Üa became the first woman to serve in the Saeima and was the only female parliamentarian of the 100-member body during the interwar period. She was elected as a deputy representing the Democratic Center and served as an assistant to the Chair for the Commission on Self Government and as secretary of the Petitions Commission. Pƒ´pi≈Üa strove to seek legal protections for women and families. When a law was proposed to force married women to relinquish their employment, Pƒ´pi≈Üa created a stir in stating her opposition, drawing the scorn of KƒÅrlis Ulmanis. She also worked on laws to provide state support for families and the poor, and was often ridiculed by her male colleagues and the press for her positions. During the same time, Pƒ´pi≈Üa participated in international women's conferences, attending \\"ICW Congresses in Vienna (1930), Stockholm (1933), Paris (1934), and Dubrovnik (1936)\\", and women's meetings held in Austria, Hungary and Russia, among others. In 1934, she co-founded a monthly periodical, Latviete (Latvian woman). The purpose of the journal was to educate women on issues concerning the nation and fight the \\"patriarchal stereotypes\\" that prohibited women from being treated as equals in society. That same year, Pƒ´pi≈Üa terminated her work with the Riga City Council and in 1935, she stepped down from her leadership of the umbrella council. She published a novel, Lejaskrodzinieka meita (Innkeeper's daughter, 1935) and in 1936, she became a vice president of ICW. When the authoritarian regime came into power in 1934, Pƒ´pi≈Üa remained active as a journalist but withdrew from politics. In 1940, when the Soviet troops occupied Latvia, she became a target and was deported to Siberia in 1941. Death and legacy Pƒ´pi≈Üa died in a labor camp on the Ob River in 1942. During the Soviet period, she was considered as an enemy of the state, having served in the independent parliament of Latvia and her biography was purged from encyclopedias. Her importance in the political history and in the women‚Äôs movement re-emerged after Latvia regained its independence.

The nonresidential users include industrial (I), commercial (C), and institutional (I) sub-sectors, which are often jointly designated as ICI or CII sector. Public water supply deliveries in the United States, shown as million gallons per day and percent share Estimates of total CII use In the United States, a USGS nationwide compilation of public supply withdrawals and deliveries indicates that in 2010 the total daily volume of nonresidential use was approximately 12,000 million gallons per day (mgd) and accounted for about 29 percent of public supply withdrawals (or 45 gallons per capita per day when divided by the estimated 268 million people who relied on public-supply water). This estimate is obtained by subtracting from total public supply freshwater withdrawals (41,700 mgd) the reported domestic (residential) use (23,800 mgd) and allowing for 14 percent of unaccounted for water (because of leaks, hydrant flushing, tower maintenance, and other system losses, also called non-revenue water). The estimates of average water loss in public supply systems in the U.S. range from 12 to 16 percent.. Summarizes the water loss percentages reported by 110 municipal respondents with the average and median reported values, respectively, were 12.1 percent and 9.9 percent The share of CII use varies across water utilities; in a sample of 31 utilities in Texas it ranged from less than 4 percent of metered use in Lamar County WSD to 79 percent in Borger MWS, with average share of 35 percent. In order to achieve improvements in the efficiency of CII water use, it is necessary to obtain information about the existing conservation potential in different types of establishments and about specific end uses of water in each CII category. Studies of water use in the CII sector were conducted by the American Water Works Association, Pacific Institute, Colorado WaterWise Council, Conserve Florida Water Clearinghouse (CFWC), and The Water Research Foundation (WRF). CII user categories and subcategories Nearly a hundred specific end uses within seven major groupings (i.e., washing and sanitation, domestic-type uses, landscape irrigation, outdoor and indoor water features, cooling and heating, food service, and process water) were compiled in the WRF study. Typically, the total CII use in an urban area or a region is broken down by categories of commercial establishments (and types of institutions or industrial plants) based on the kinds of goods and services provided, or their function. The category's water use is then separated into several end uses (or purposes). The following list of 14 major CII categories of nonresidential buildings or establishments (with examples of possible subcategories) are commonly found in an urban water service area of a public water supplier (or water utility): *Establishments/sites with a dominant water end use: commercial/industrial laundries, laundromats, car washes, city parks and recreation areas, public pools and water parks, golf courses, irrigated landscape areas. *Office buildings: large offices w/cooling towers, office complexes w/irrigation, small office buildings. *Lodging places: hotels, motels and inns, resort hotels (with and without irrigation and cooling). *Eating places: full-service restaurants, fast food outlets, bakeries and cafeterias, bars and clubs. *Food sales: grocery stores and supermarkets, convenience stores. *Retail outlets: retail stores, strip shopping centers and enclosed malls, liquor stores. *Schools: pre-schools and day care, primary and secondary schools, university/college campuses. *Health care: hospitals and sanitariums, medical centers, doctor offices, laboratories. *Service: auto service (auto sales, gas stations, auto repair shops), personal services. *Public assembly buildings: community centers, meeting halls, convention centers, health clubs, bowling alleys, ice rinks, museums, theaters, cinemas, sports arenas, libraries, funeral homes, exhibition halls. *Public order and safety facilities: police stations, fire stations, prison, reformatory, or penitentiary, courthouse or probation office *Religious buildings: churches, synagogues, monasteries, mosques, sanctuaries. *Elderly care facilities: retirement homes, residential care/assisted living, hospices. *Manufacturing: heavy industry, light industry, food and beverage processing, machine shops. These CII categories and subcategories account for a high percentage of the total CII use. Some of these building/establishment types are identified at some levels of aggregation of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and former Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Also, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) identified 85 types of commercial buildings and facilities which were grouped into 16 general categories. Many of these overlap with the list of 14 groupings listed above. Water use metrics and benchmarks Water use intensity (WUI) metrics in gallons/1000 square feet/day: Average values from EIA data on large commercial buildings and Median values from EPA Portfolio Manager data Water conservation planners (at water utilities) and CII customers use several metrics of water use (and their associated benchmarks) in order to assess their success in achieving water use efficiency goals. A ‚Äúmetric‚Äù (or ‚Äúperformance indicator‚Äù) is a unit of measure (based on a formula) that can be used to calculate the rate of water use during a given period of time (and at a given level of data aggregation). A ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù is a particular (numerical) value of a metric that denotes a specific level of performance, such as a water-use efficiency target. When quantifying water use in the CII sector, the total volume of consumption (over any given time interval) at any given CII facility is ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù by the scale of water-using activity, which corresponds to the rate at which water is used (also referred to as water use intensity or WUI). Two scaling factors (or \\"proxy\\" measures of scale), the number of employees and the square footage of buildings (or facilities) are commonly used in the CII sector because the employment and floor space data are generally available. Examples of the corresponding proxy metrics are: water use per employee in manufacturing plants, or water use per square foot in office buildings. However, more appropriate are \\"functional\\" metrics such as water use per occupied room in hotels, or water use per meal served in restaurants, since they are linked more directly to water use. National surveys of commercial buildings by the U.S. DOE Energy Information Administration and EPA Energy Star provided proxy metrics data on the mean and median values of water use per square foot of buildings floor space. The median values are useful when placing water use in a CII establishment among its peers because the sample distributions typically have a pronounced right tail skew. Mean (or average) values are useful to planners who need to estimate total category use based on results from a sample of establishments. Water utilities often adopt water efficiency programs that are directed specifically to CII customers. The programs often target the largest water users as well as specific categories of CII customers including government and municipal buildings, large landscape areas, schools and colleges, office buildings, restaurants and hotels. Water use information in these and other readily recognizable functional classes of CII users from several studies of the CII sector are briefly characterized below. Water use in major CII categories =Office buildings= In the U.S. cities, the share of the total CII use of water in office buildings ranges from 12 percent (in Tampa, Florida) to 30 percent (in New York City). The three largest uses of water in office buildings include restrooms, heating and cooling, and landscape watering. The reported proxy metrics of water use intensity (WUI) for office buildings range from 25 gallons/1000 square feet/day (g/ksf/d) to 129 g/ksf/d with reported weighted average use from eight utilities from Florida and Texas of 88 g/ksf/d. The reported median values range from 34 g/ksf/d to 62 g/ksf/d. Estimates of average daily use per employee range from 9 gallons/employee/day (ged) to 18 ged with the median value of 13 ged in the EPA‚Äôs Energy Star Portfolio Manager data.. Nationwide, there are approximately 1,012 thousand office buildings with a combined floor space of 1,952 million square feet.EIA CBECS Assuming the WUI of 88 g/ksf/d as representing average office usage in the U.S., the total country-wide use would be 1,400 mgd or close to 12 percent of CII use. Significant quantities of water can be saved in older office buildings by replacing bathroom fixtures, cooling tower efficiency retrofits, and adopting efficient landscape irrigation measures. Estimates of potential water conservation savings range from 19 percent in southwest Florida to 30 percent or more in California. =Retail outlets= Retail (also classified under mercantile or commerce) includes retail stores, vehicle dealerships, strip shopping centers, and enclosed malls. Retail outlets account for significant percentage of CII use; examples include 4 percent in Oakland CA (East Bay MUD), 5 percent in Austin TX, about 15 percent in Tampa FL, 17 percent in Phoenix AZ, and 20 percent in New York City. The major end uses in retail stores are space cooling, restrooms and landscape irrigation. The reported proxy metrics on water use intensity in retail outlets include an estimate of 122 gallons/1000 square feet/day (g/ksf/d) in Phoenix AZ, 40 g/ksf/d in Santa Fe NM, and 98 g/ksf/d for one-story stores and 115 g/ksf/d for community shopping centers based on data from eight utilities in Florida and Texas. According to the EIA survey there are 438 thousand retail stores (other than malls) and 164 thousand enclosed and strip malls in the U.S. Their estimated total floor space is, respectively, 5,439 and 5,890 million square feet. Assuming the WUI of 98 g/ksf/d for retail stores and 115 g/ksf/d for shopping centers, the combined use of retail outlets in the U.S. would be 1,210 mgd or 10 percent of total CII use. =Restaurants= Restaurants (and fast food places) account for about 3 percent of total CII use in Austin, Texas and 5 percent in Oakland, California (EBMUD) and up to 8 percent in the State of Florida. The largest uses of water in restaurants result from kitchen activities such as washing dishes, making ice, and preparing food. A significant amount of water is also used for restrooms. The proxy metrics data show WUIs in restaurants ranging from 474 to 578 g/ksf/d in selected Colorado utilities, an average of 589 g/ksf/d in Austin, Texas,, as referenced in and 670 g/ksf/d in Florida. Somewhat wider range of 356 to 907 g/ksf/d was reported in an earlier study. Data on functional metrics suggests that restaurants would use around 6 to 9 gallons of water per meal served, 20 to 31 gallons per seat per day, and 86 to 122 gallons per employee per day. Other studies reported 17 gallons/seat/day in Santa Fe, New Mexico and 29 gallons/seat per day in Colorado utilities. Given the total floor space of 380 thousand food service buildings of 1,819 million square feet and assuming average use of 521 g/ksf/d, the total U.S.-wide use in restaurants would be 950 mgd or close to 8 percent of CII use. Restaurants can save significant amounts of water by maximizing the efficiency of pre-rinse spray valves, food disposal systems and upgrading dishwashers, ice machines, and steam cookers to Energy Star¬Æ qualified models that use less water. =Schools= The shares of total CII use in schools range from 3.5 percent in Phoenix, Arizona to 6.5 percent in Tampa, Florida and up to 8 percent in Oakland, California. Most schools use water for restrooms, cooling and heating, irrigation of outdoor playing fields and lawns, locker rooms, laboratories, and cafeteria kitchens. An expected intensity of use (WUI) in schools would be between 22 and 44 g/ksf/d for indoor use and from 110 to 255 g/ksf/d of total use. More recent studies show observed school use of 33 to 52 g/ksf/d in Colorado and 76 g/ksf/d in eight utilities from Florida and Texas. The EPA Energy Star‚Äôs Portfolio Manager shows median use of 27 g/ksf/d. Data on functional metrics show schools' use between 3 and 15 gallons per school day per student for indoor use. and between 4.7 and 23.6 gallons/student/day in Santa Fe, New Mexico. There are 389,000 school buildings in the U.S. with the total floor space of 12,239 million square feet. This building count includes preschools and day care, elementary and middle schools, high schools, and colleges and universities. Given the total floor space of these educational facilities and assuming average use (WUI) of 68 g/ksf/d, as representing average use in the U.S., the total use in schools would be about 830 mgd or close to 7 percent of the total CII use. Because most water is used in restrooms and locker rooms, installing WaterSense labeled showerheads, toilets, bathroom faucets, and flushing urinals and also periodically checking automatic sensors on these fixtures would help ensure they are operating properly and thus eliminate unnecessary water use. =Hotels and motels= The share of total CII water use by hotels and motels in the U.S. cities ranges from 3 percent in Oakland, California and 4 percent in Austin, Texas to 13 percent in the State of Florida. Average daily use in hotels depends on the type and size of the hotel and the presence of the major end uses of water including cooling towers, on- site laundry, dining and kitchen, swimming pool, and landscape irrigation. For example, in a sample of 706 hotels in New York City, average daily water use intensity in 2011 ranged from 60 to 456 gallons per 1000 square feet (g/ksf/d), with the median use of 215 g/ksf/d. In other areas the median use per 1000 square feet were reported at: 257 gallons in Florida, and 219 gallons in Austin, Texas. The EPA Energy Star‚Äôs Portfolio Manager that tracks water use at CII facilities found median use in hotels of 102 gallons/room/day. Given the existing inventory of about 5 million hotel rooms in the country with the combined floor space of 3,319 million square feet, and assuming average use of 209 g/ksf/d, the estimated total water use would be 694 mgd or about 6 percent of the CII use. A popular way of saving water in hotels is by encouraging guests to reuse towels and bed linens in order to cut down on the amount of water used in hotel laundry and also by upgrading guest rooms with EPA WaterSense labeled faucets, shower heads, and toilets. =Hospitals= Water use by hospitals and other health care facilities accounts for about 3 percent of CII use in Phoenix, Arizona, and about 11 percent in New York City. The EPA Energy Star‚Äôs Portfolio Manager, (designed to track water use of CII facilities) found hospitals to be the third most intense use category, at around 150 gallons per 1000 square feet per day (g/ksf/d), following senior care facilities and hotels, with some facilities reporting WUIs of greater than 410 g/ksf/d. Other studies reported average use of 159 g/ksf/d in Austin, Texas, and a median of 140 g/ksf/d in EPA's Portfolio Managers data set. Data from medical offices show usage rates of 156 g/ksf/d in Florida. and 64 g/ksf/d in Santa Fe, New Mexico. With respect to functional metrics, the Portfolio Manager data show the median hospital use of 315 gallons of water per hospital bed per day. Given the total floor space of 2,374 million square feet in 10 thousand inpatient care (hospital) buildings and assuming the average WUI of 186 g/ksf/d, the total use in hospitals would be 442 mgd or close to 3.7 percent of CII use. In addition, there are 147 thousand buildings with outpatient care clinics and medical offices with the total floor space of 1,780 million square feet. Assuming average use of 132 g/ksf/d, the total use in outpatient care would be 235 mgd or close to 2.0 percent of CII use. Hospitals can save water by employing water-efficient practices through operational improvements and upgraded equipment, especially cooling towers and other cooling and heating equipment. =Elderly care facilities= Nursing homes and assisted living communities account for 3.2 percent of CII use in the State of Florida and 5.4 percent in the urban area served by Tampa Bay Water. The reported estimates of WUI are 232 g/ksf/d in eight utilities from Florida and Texas and a range from 170 to 277 g/ksf/d in Colorado. There are approximately 15,600 nursing homes (with 1,663,300 beds) and 30,200 residential care communities (with 1,000,000 beds) in the U.S. Based on the total floor space of 1,275 million square feet and an assumed average use of 232 g/ksf/d, the total water use by elderly care buildings in the U.S. would be 296 mgd or 2.5 percent of CII use. =Car washes= There are 113 thousand commercial car washes in the U.S. and about 8 million cars are washed each day. Average use of fresh water to wash a car is about 38 gallons per vehicle (gpv) in automatic bay and conveyor types and about 15 gallons in self-service bays. Significantly less fresh water is needed in washes with reclaim water systems. Total estimated use of water in commercial car washes is about 2 percent of CII use. =Supermarkets/food sales= Water used in food stores and supermarkets represents about 1 percent or less of total CII use. Supermarkets use considerable quantities of water to cool the condensers units for the refrigeration systems, such as display coolers and freezers, storage coolers and freezers, butcher shops, delis, and bakeries. In addition, water is used in the cleaning and preparation of the fresh produce, meats, and fish before the products are put onto the shelves. Data on the intensity of water use include the estimate of 113 g/ksf/d in Santa Fe and a range from 161 to 295 g/ksf/d in other Southwestern U.S. locations. EPA's Portfolio Manager reported median use of 66 g/ksf/d. Other metrics include estimated 2.6 to 4.5 gallons per transaction. In the U.S., there are 177 thousand buildings involved in food sales. These include convenience stores, grocery stores and supermarkets with the total floor space of 1,252 million square feet. Given the total floor space and assuming average use intensity (WUI) of 65 g/ksf/d, as representing average use in the U.S., the total use in food sales would be 81 mgd or 0.7 percent of CII use. =Manufacturing= Use of public supply water by manufacturing category varies greatly across U.S. cities depending on the presence (or absence) of water-intensive manufacturing plants and the availability of local sources of water supply. The available data indicate shares of 9 percent in Tampa, Florida and New York City; 15 percent in Austin, Texas, 21 percent in Oakland, California (East Bay MUD) and 13 percent in North Carolina. in the U.S. there are 170,169 manufacturing establishments with a combined floor space of 11,100 million square feet. Most large manufacturing plants have their own source of water supply and purchase some amounts of drinking quality water from public systems. In 2010, the self- supplied industrial use (excluding thermoelectric plants and mining) was 15,900 mgd. The amount purchased from public systems was reported to be 4,750 mgd in 1995 (or about 40 percent of total CII use). Based on the total floor space of 11,100 million square feet in manufacturing buildings in the U.S. and assuming average use of 215 g/ksf/d, the total use of publicly-supplied water by the CII manufacturing category in the U.S. would be about 2,400 mgd or about 20 percent of the total CII use.

Its primary mission is to ensure that Vancouver becomes the greenest city in the world by the year 2020.\\"Greenest City 2020 Action Plan ‚Äì the City's Sustainability Plan\\" (PDF). Retrieved 1 March 2014. The GCAP originated based on the 2009 work of the Greenest City Action Team, a committee co-chaired by Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson. The GCAP was approved by Vancouver city council in July 2011. The GCAP consists of 10 primary goals that focus on 3 primary topics: carbon, waste, and ecosystems. Within each of the 10 goals, the plan establishes measurable targets and offers baseline data against which to compare those targets. It offers ‚Äòhighest priority actions‚Äô and broader ‚Äòkey strategies‚Äô to achieve the targets it sets out.  Goals  The GCAP outlines the following 10 discrete goals: Greenery in Vancouver's downtown Robson Square * Green economy: double the number of green jobs and businesses with green operations * Climate leadership: require all new buildings built after 2020 to be carbon neutral * Green buildings: reduce CO2 emissions in existing buildings by 20% over 2007 levels * Green transportation: reduce driving and make the majority of trips by foot, bicycle, and public transit traffic * Zero waste: reduce solid waste going to landfills to 50% of 2008 levels * Access to nature: increase accessibility of green parks, greenways, and other green space, so that all Vancouver residents live within 5 minutes of these spaces * Lighter footprint: reduce Vancouver's ecological footprint by 33% over 2006 levels * Clean water: increase water quality and reduce water consumption per capita by 33% from 2006 levels * Clean air: increase air quality, measured against Metro Vancouver and World Health Organization guidelines * Local food: increase amount of locally grown food  Current status  Siwash Rock, visible from the sea wall on the north end of Vancouver's Stanley Park There have been many steps taken to reduce waste and recycle more in the city. Out of all the priority actions, 80% have already been completed. Many ‚Äúbeaches, shorelines and waterfronts throughout Vancouver‚Äù have been cleaned up and restored. ‚ÄúGreenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) have been reduced by 7% across the city‚Äù which is an 18% decrease per capita since 2007. Newly constructed buildings are now using 50% less energy than those built elsewhere in the province. Cycling and walking networks within the city have been expanded, with the addition of a 28 kilometer cycling path (the Vancouver Seawall) along the ocean. Additionally, two million dollars have been funded to community-led projects for a greener Vancouver. The City of Vancouver also ‚Äúopposed the Kinder Morgan pipeline, [to prevent] a sevenfold increase in oil tanker traffic in Vancouver‚Äôs harbor‚Äù, which would put the shoreline and climate at risk. Further, ‚Äúthe creation of a new coal export terminal on the Fraser River‚Äù was opposed by the city, which banned any future coal facilities from being built in Vancouver to protect residents from toxic dust and the planet from rapid climate change. Currently, ‚Äúabout 76% of the waste created through the construction of new buildings or the demolition of old ones is recycled or in the case of wood, used for energy‚Äù; however, this is still far from ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù. By fostering a closed-loop economy, which means using material like metal, wood and other materials in ‚Äúa single direction‚Äù, they still need to be replaced with materials that can be reused for other purposes. Establishing Neighbourhood Food Networks (NFNs) is another way that the city is working towards sustainable food consumption systems. Since the GCAP's implementation, there have been five grants that have funded NFNs in the City of Vancouver. The Greenest City Neighbourhood Grants program of 2010 and Social Responsibility Fund of 2011 are a few examples of funding that has been provided for projects on a variety of green initiatives such as gardening, workshops, and community kitchens. In November 2013, cigarette recycling bins were placed around the city, becoming the first city to do so. The city claimed that cigarettes were the most littered item in the city as the reason for the rollout, as part of the Greenest City action plan. The collected items are sent to TerraCycle for recycling.  Reception  West Vancouver, seen from the ocean-side bicycle path in Vancouver's Stanley Park = Criticism = In 2015, Vancouver sought input from the general public on the initiative. Some respondents emphasized that the action plan is not enough and that ‚Äúwe need to do more to protect what we have rather than react to what we‚Äôve lost.‚Äù Thus, having an active and proactive approach is emphasized rather than a reactive approach. Former city councillor Fred Bass commented that to ‚Äúsave our ecosystems, we need to be heroic [as] we‚Äôre facing a real ecological emergency.‚Äù The public‚Äôs criticism is that they want to see measurable and concrete results instead of objectives such as to ‚Äúsecure critical and sensitive habitats and environmental corridors‚Äù. The public wants to know how are these objectives being implemented and if they are being achieved. There needs to be doable actions and specific measures taken towards each goal without more development projects that would have adverse results of hurting the environment. = Support = Support for the initiative has come in the form of international recognition. In 2015, Vancouver won a C40 Cities award, given in recognition of cities that demonstrate world-leading sustainability initiatives. Vancouver was recognized as the third greenest city in the world according to the 2016 Global Green Economy Index, behind only Copenhagen and Stockholm.\\"2016 Global Green Economy Index\\" (PDF).

Jean Aubin on the other hand, proposed Bakr beg Mawsillu as her maternal grandfather. She also had a sister named Beksi Khanum.  Marriage  According to Angiolello and Ramusio, the Safavid shah Ismail I (r. 1501‚Äì1524) married Tajlu Khanum after defeating the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Murad ibn Ya'qub in 1503, but according to the Safavid-period historians such as Budaq Monshi Qazvini, she was the wife of the Afrasiyabid ruler Kiya Husayn II, who had during the dissolution of the Aq Qoyunlu confederation expanded his rule from western Mazandaran into parts of Persian Iraq. Ismail I invaded the latters territories and put an end to his rule in 1504, where he afterwards took Tajlu Khanum into his harem.

At the time, Alauddin was the governor of Kara in Delhi Sultanate, which was ruled by Jalaluddin Khalji. Alauddin kept his march to Devagiri a secret from Jalaluddin, because he intended to use the wealth obtained from this raid for dethroning the Sultan. When Alauddin reached Devagiri, the Yadava king Ramachandra retreated to the hill fort, and Alauddin's army thoroughly ransacked the lower city. The defenders were under-prepared for a siege, as the Yadava army was away on an expedition under Ramachandra's son Simhana and the fort of Devagiri had insufficient provisions. Therefore, Ramachandra agreed to a peace treaty, offering Alauddin a large sum of money. However, Simhana soon arrived in the capital and engaged Alauddin in a battle. Alauddin emerged victorious, and forced the Yadavas to agree to a peace treaty. This time, the Yadavas were forced to pay a much larger war indemnity, and had to offer the revenues of the Achalpur province to Alauddin as tribute. Alauddin returned to Kara after spending some days in Devagiri. He subsequently dethroned Jalaluddin, and sent a second expedition to Devagiri in 1308, which forced Ramachandra to become his vassal.  Background  Alauddin Khalji was a nephew and a son-in-law of Jalaluddin Khalji, the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. At that time, he was the governor of a province within the Sultanate and lived in the provincial capital Kara. The Yadava kingdom was located to the south of the Sultanate, in the Deccan region. The Paramara and the Chandela kingdoms, which separated the Delhi Sultanate and the Yadava kingdom, had declined in power. Alauddin wanted to usurp the power from Jalaluddin and had decided to plunder other kingdoms to raise money towards this objective. During his 1293 raid on Bhilsa, he had come to know about the immense wealth of the Yadava capital of Devagiri. Over the next few years, he made preparations to attack Devagiri. He intended to complete the raid secretly and in a very short time, to avoid suspicion of Sultan Jalaluddin and to prevent any countermeasures by the Hindu kingdoms of Deccan. Therefore, he spread the false news that he was marching to Chanderi. He handed over the administration of Kara to Ala-ul-Mulk (the uncle of Ziauddin Barani), who sent fabricated news about Alauddin's movements to Jalaluddin.  March to Devagiri  On 26 February 1296, Alauddin left Kara with an 8000-strong cavalry. He marched to Chanderi, and then secretly moved to Bhilsa. Next, he crossed the Vindhya range, and reached Achalpur. Until this point, Alauddin had moved quickly to prevent any attacks from the local rulers of central India. However, at Achalpur, he allowed his troops to rest for two days to prepare for the raid. To avoid any attacks, he spread the news that he was a discontented nobleman who had come to seek asylum after rebelling against Jalaluddin. From Achalpur, Alauddin marched to Devagiri via a pass known as Ghati Lajaura (or Lasaura). At this pass, Alauddin faced resistance from Kanhan, a feudatory of the Yadava king Ramachandra. According to the 14th-century historian Isami, Kanhan's army included two women commanders who fought like \\"tigresses\\", and forced Alauddin to fall back. However, Alauddin's second charge was successful and resulted in a complete rout of Kanhan's forces.  At Devagiri  Devagiri was a fortified city, but it was largely unprotected when Alauddin reached there. The fortifications had weakened because of complacency of the Yadavas, who had not faced any recent attacks on their capital. The major portion of the Yadava army was away on an expedition led by the crown prince Simhana. In addition, the fort was short on provisions. The old Yadava king Ramachandra retreated to the fort, which was located on the top of a hill. Alauddin's army plundered houses and businesses in the lower part of the city, which had been left undefended. The invaders imprisoned the prominent merchants and Brahmins of the city. They also captured 30-40 elephants and around 1,000 horses from the royal stables. Meanwhile, Alauddin spread a rumour that his force was only the vanguard of a 20,000-strong cavalry, which would shortly reach Devagiri. Under these circumstances, Ramchandra realized that he would not be able to withstand a siege. Therefore, he sent messengers to Alauddin, warning him that Simhana would arrive with the Yadava army anytime, and it would be in Alauddin's best interests to agree to a peace treaty. Alauddin wanted to return to Kara quickly, in order to keep his march a secret. Therefore, he accepted Ramachandra's offer of a monetary payment, and in exchange, promised to release all prisoners and leave the city within a fortnight. However, before the treaty could be realized, Simhana returned to Devagiri. When he arrived near Devagiri, Ramachandra sent him a message advising him to honour the peace treaty, as the invading army was very powerful. However, Simhana ignored his father's advice, and sent a message to Alauddin, asking the invader to return all the loot and retreat. According to the 16th-century historian Firishta, this message angered Alauddin so much that he blackened the faces of Simhana's messengers, and paraded them in his camp. Alauddin left a 1000-strong cavalry under Nusrat Khan in the city and led the rest of his men to fight against Simhana. The Yadava army, which outnumbered Alauddin's force, overcame the invaders in the initial part of the battle. When Nusrat Khan received this news, he left the city without waiting for Alauddin's order and led his army to the battlefield. The Yadavas mistook his contingent for the rumored 20,000-strong cavalry and fled from the battlefield in panic. Alauddin then returned to the fort and laid a siege. He ordered several Brahmin and merchant prisoners to be killed, and paraded close relatives and nobles of Ramachandra in front of the fort. At first, Ramachandra considered seeking assistance from the neighbouring Hindu kings. However, it was soon discovered that the fort did not have sufficient food provisions: the Yadavas had bought inside the fort around 2,000-3,000 bags left by panicked merchants when Alauddin's army first reached the city. They had assumed that these bags contained grain, but it was discovered that they contained only salt. A dejected Ramachandra then pleaded with Alauddin for a peace treaty. Alauddin, who wanted to return to Kara quickly, agreed to a truce. This time, he demanded a much larger sum as war indemnity. According to the 14th-century chronicler Ziauddin Barani, the wealth obtained by Alauddin during this raid was so much that even after being squandered by Alauddin's successors, a large part of it remained till the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq in the 1350s. According to the 16th-century historian Firishta, the wealth obtained by Alauddin included: * 600 mann of gold * 1,000 mann of silver * 7 mann of pearls * 2 mann of precious stones including rubies, sapphires, diamonds, and emeralds * 4,000 pieces of silk and other items In addition, Ramachandra agreed to send the revenues from the Achalpur province to Alauddin. As part of the treaty, Alauddin released the surviving prisoners. He left Devagiri five days after he had entered the city.  Aftermath  Alauddin's raid was the first successful Muslim invasion of Deccan. Instead of surrendering the loot from Devagiri to Sultan Jalaluddin, Alauddin took it to his residence in Kara. Later, he invited Jalaluddin to Kara and killed him there. He then proclaimed himself as the new Sultan. In the 1300s, when Ramachandra stopped sending yearly tributes to Delhi, Alauddin sent a large army to subdue him. This second expedition to Devagiri resulted in Ramachandra becoming a vassal to Alauddin. Alauddin married Ramachandra's daughter Jhatyapali, who was the mother of his son and successor Shihabuddin Omar and Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah. Historian Kishori Saran Lal believes that Ramachandra gave his daughter to Alauddin after the 1296 raid, but historian Satish Chandra states that this probably happened after the second expedition.

He served as the palace treasurer and head of customs under the reign of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II. Biography =Early life= G√§bre-Heyw√§t Bayk√§da√± was born to Ras Makonmen (his father) in Adwa, but was raised by a Swedish mission in Eritrea. Influenced by his father's fascination with Japan's commitment and success in modernisation, Heyw√§t formed a predilection for capitalism and its capacity as a means to economic development. After the completion of his secondary studies, Heyw√§t went on to study in both Germany and Austria. After working for a period in Germany, he was soon recruited to work as an interpreter for a German diplomatic mission to Addis Ababa. Through this expedition, Heyw√§t developed a close relationship with Menelik II prior to the latter's ascension. =Ethiopian Governance= Becoming an important member of Menelik's entourage, Heyw√§t served as a senior counsel and advised on and was a strong proponent of Ethiopia's modernisation. Specifically, Heyw√§t sought to integrate Ethiopia into the global economy while maintaining Ethiopia's cultural and political integrity. Deeply concerned with the state of the Ethiopian economy, and understanding the economic importance of a productive middle class, Heyw√§t pushed for structural social, political, and economic reform, which are partially reflected in efforts to remove unjust taxation and patrimonialism, while bureaucratic rationalism, the prohibition of slavery, and the elimination of noble privileges were promoted. Heyw√§t exerted a considerable degree of influence over Menlik's making of policy, which was compounded by the influence of other senior policymakers that were informally grouped as the 'Young Japanisers' - a loose grouping that sought to replicate Japan's industrialisation, which included the likes of Heruy Wolde Selassie. A lead advocate of industrialisation, Heyw√§t's publication of Government and Public Administration advised the emperor to 'follow the example of the Japanese government' or 'be enslaved'. Following Menelik's death and the 1916 coup, he was first appointed controller of the (French built) railways and later collector of customs in D√©rre Dawa, where he died.Salvadore, 2007Whyte, 2014  References  1886 births 1919 deaths Government ministers of Ethiopia 19th-century Ethiopian people 20th- century Ethiopian people ","title":"G√§bre-Heyw√§t Bayk√§da√±"},{"id":"53727537","text":"Hanspeter Pfister is a Swiss computer scientist.

It is of the genus Camellia of flowering plants in the family Theaceae. C. taliensis is an important wild relative to the cultivated tea plant Camellia sinensis. It also belongs to the same section Thea as C. sinensis. It is an endangered species due to human overpopulation causing fragmentation of the plant's natural habitat and from overpicking of the leaves for the tea market.Chen et al. 2005  Nomenclature and taxonomy   Description  Camellia talensis has five locules per ovary while in comparison C. sinensis has three locules per ovary. It grows primarily in the southwestern portion of Yunnan province in China and in neighboring areas in Thailand and northern Myanmar. C. taliensis has larger leaves than C. sinensis var. sinensis closer to the size of C. sinensis var. assamica. And, in several chemical composition and morphological comparisons, C. taliensis is also closer to C. sinensis var. assamica than to C. sinensis var. sinensis. However, the closer similarity may also be due to human selection (which causes reduction in genetic diversity) as C. sinensis var. assamica is the tea variety traditionally cultivated in Yunnan. Like C. sinensis, C. taliensis contains both theanine and caffeine. C. talensis can be easily crossed with C. sinensis, and the resulting crossbred plants are intermediate between species both morphologically and chemically indicating true hybrids.  Cultivation  Camellia taliensis is locally used to make white tea, black tea, and pu'er tea.https://sevencups.com/shop/lao-shu-dian-hong-old-tree- yunnanhttps://teatrekker.com/product/yunnan-da-bai-silver-needles/Liu et al. (2012) Yue Guang Bai (ÊúàÂÖâÁôΩ \\"Moonlight White\\") is a white tea made from the plant.

Multiple officials from the United States condemned the handling of the protests by the Venezuelan government. Some officials proposing targeted sanctions on Venezuelan government officials that they say violated human rights, however, these proposed sanctions have been debated. :*President of the United States Barack Obama stated, \\"Rather than trying to distract from protests by making false accusations against U.S. diplomats, Venezuela's government should address the people's legitimate grievances.\\" and called on Venezuela to release detained protesters. President Obama also said, \\"Along with the Organization of American States, we call on the Venezuelan government to release protesters it has detained and engage in real dialogue.\\" In a personal letter to a resident of Miami, President Obama also said that \\"he was concerned for the Venezuelan people and is working behind the scenes to do what he can to support the people oppressed\\". :*Vice President of the United States Joe Biden called the situation \\"alarming\\", accused the government of, \\"Confronting peaceful protesters with force and in some cases with armed vigilantes; limiting the freedoms of press and assembly necessary for legitimate political debate; demonizing and arresting political opponents; and dramatically tightening restrictions on the media\\" and said that instead of working on dialogue, \\"Maduro has thus far tried to distract his people from the profound issues at stake in Venezuela by concocting totally false and outlandish conspiracy theories about the United States.\\" :*United States Secretary of State John Kerry expressed grievances towards affected families of the violence and is \\"particularly alarmed by reports that the Venezuelan government has arrested or detained scores of anti-government protesters and issued an arrest warrant for Leopoldo Lopez\\".

Kelly, United States Marine Corps general and Commander of the United States Southern Command, said to a Senate committee that in Venezuela, \\"It is a situation that is obviously just coming apart in front us, and unless there is some type of a miracle that either the opposition or the Maduro government pulls out, they are going down catastrophically in terms of economy, in terms of democracy,\\" Kelly also wished that, \\"somehow Venezuelans resolve this themselves\\" and that, \\"larger U.S. government agencies are paying close attention\\" to monitor the cyber tools the Venezuelan government is allegedly using against its citizens. :*Members of the United States Congress pushed for the United States to place sanctions on Venezuela due to human rights violations during the protests. However, President Obama only concentrated on imposing individual sanctions on Venezuelan officials. On 5 March, John Kerry said that the United States was ready to place sanctions on Venezuela if the OAS did not get involved with dialogue. On 8 May, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing discussing human rights violations by the Venezuelan government and proposals of sanctions by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen that later passed through the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The bill, called the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act (H.R. 4587; 113th Congress), passed the House of Representatives in a voice vote on May 28, 2014. The sanctions performed under the bill would be directed at Venezuelan government officials who were involved in acts that mistreated protesters and would result in those who were sanctioned having their assets frozen and being barred from entering the United States. :*On 30 July, the spokeswoman for the State Department, Marie Harf, stated that, \\"The Secretary of State decided to impose restrictions on travel to the United States a number of Venezuelan officials responsible for or complicit in human rights violations\\" and concluded stating \\"Our message is clear: those who commit such abuses will not be welcome in the United States\\". :*On 20 November, the US Deputy National Security Advisor of President Obama, Tony Blinken, stated that the Obama administration would work with the United States Congress to move forward and impose targeted sanctions on Venezuela after diplomatic efforts by Latin American countries failed to release opposition leaders and lead toward electoral changes. A month later on 18 December 2014, President Obama sign the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 into law, granting targeted sanctions such as freezing assets or denying visas of those in Venezuela accused of violating human rights during the protests. * ‚Äì President of Uruguay Jos√© Mujica considered that the demonstrations are a result of the ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela. * ‚Äì Secretary of State of the Vatican, Monsignor Pietro Parolin, met with Jorge Roig discussing the situation in Venezuela and the need for dialogue. Parolin once again affirmed the Catholic Church's commitment to help bring peace to the people of Venezuela. =Catholic Church= 15px Holy See ‚Äì Pope Francis asked for an end to violence and said, \\"I sincerely hope the violence and hostility ends as soon as possible, and that the Venezuelan people, beginning with the responsible politicians and institutions, act to foster national reconciliation through mutual forgiveness and sincere dialogue.\\" * The president of the Venezuelan Bishops Conference, Bishop Diego Padr√≥n said that, \\"the claim of the official party and authorities of the Republic to implement the so-called plan of the country (established by the late President Hugo Chavez), behind which the imposition of a totalitarian government is hiding\\" and denounced \\"the abusive and excessive repression against them (the protesters), the torture they have undergone many of the detainees and the prosecution mayors and contrary Members of the ruling (...) The government is wrong to want to solve the crisis by force, repression is not the way\\". Padr√≥n also asked the government to, \\"ensure protection for the demonstrators, to provide explanations for the arrests and list charges against those in custody, and to listen to the people\\". The Venezuelan Bishops Conference condemned the government over an abuse of authority saying it \\"has gone beyond the limits causing unfortunate and irreversible consequences\\" and asked the government to stop \\"colectivos\\" from \\"committing criminal actions\\". On 11 July, during the 102nd Ordinary Meeting of the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference (CEV), the CEV demanded the release of political prisoners, said that a \\"totalitarian political model and a centralized education\\" is threatening in Venezuela, denounced criminalization of the protests and said there will be no solution to the protests until the \\"causes of the protests are met\\". ** Cardinal Jorge Urosa Savino said that he has seen some vandalism by opposition protesters, but with the government, \\"There is a serious violation of human rights that must be addressed and must be punished\\" and that, \\"deaths and injuries are from attacks against peaceful demonstrations\\". ** Monsignor Victor Hugo Basabe said that some churches were attacked during masses and that, \\"We have churches in areas where conflict has been high and have also been attacked by violent groups,\\" ** Monsignor Ovidio P√©rez Morales called the government's \\"Homeland\\" plan \\"unconstitutional\\" and said that it is trying to implement \\"Castro- socialism\\". =Others= * Amnesty International ‚Äì Amnesty International has asked the government to investigate the deaths. Guadalupe Marengo said: \\"It is extremely concerning that violence has become a regular feature during protests in Venezuela. If the authorities are truly committed to preventing more deaths, they must ensure those responsible for the violence, demonstrators, security forces and armed civilians alike face justice. The Venezuelan authorities must show they are truly committed to respect people's rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly by ensuring they can participate in protests without fear of being abused, detained or even killed. It is essential that journalists are allowed to report events freely and human right defenders are able to monitor demonstrations.\\". They have claimed that the government has started a \\"witch hunt against opposition leaders\\" after the arrest of Daniel Ceballos. * Carter Center and the Friends of the Inter- American Democratic Charter ‚Äì a 20 February statement strongly condemned the detention of students; expressed particular concern about the arrest of Lopez and the raid of the office of his political party without a warrant; and expressed similar concern about the obstacles to media reporting. Point-by- point, they \\"condemned\\" the \\"repression of peaceful demonstrations and the arbitrary detention of Venezuelan students\\" and the \\"arbitrary arrest of political leaders\\"; called for the release of detainees and independent inquiries into the violence; asked the Venezuelan government to adhere to the Inter-American Democratic Charter; and reminded all Venezuelans that protests should be peaceful. * Club de Madrid ‚Äì A group of 96 former heads of government of numerous countries gathered denouncing the \\"rapid deterioration\\" of human rights in Venezuela and signed a statement asking the government, \\"to immediately release political prisoners and Leopoldo L√≥pez and the cessation of the persecution of political leaders\\" and asked the international community \\"to join in a concerted effort to strengthen democracy and the preservation of peace in Venezuela\\". * Council on Hemispheric Affairs ‚Äì commends the Venezuelan government for \\"show[ing] restraint and resolve in the face of violent anti-Chavista mayhem.\\" * European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left ‚Äì condemns \\"the attempted coup in Venezuela, violence by opposition groups in Venezuela, and regrets the loss of life and destruction of public property in the country. We likewise denounce the undemocratic and insurgent aims of this destabilisation campaign, unleashed onto the streets of Caracas and other Venezuelan cities by extremist groups. We hold the opposition forces and the Venezuelan right (supported by the U.S. with links to the dominant forces in the EU) responsible for these actions and their dire consequences\\". * Human Rights Foundation ‚Äì condemned the crackdown on the political opposition with the chairman of Human Rights Foundation, Garry Kasparov, saying, \\"The shadow of dictatorship is quickly falling upon Venezuela. The imprisonment of a prominent human rights activist and hundreds of students inside the political police's dungeons is a step toward the complete silencing of civil society by the Venezuelan regime\\". * Human Rights Watch ‚Äì Jos√© Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said: \\"What Venezuela urgently needs is for these killings to be investigated and the killers brought to justice, no matter their political affiliation. What Venezuela does not need is authorities scapegoating political opponents or shutting down news outlets whose coverage they don't like.\\" * International Socialist Committee for Latin America and the Caribbean ‚Äì asked the Venezuelan government for the release of \\"all students and political prisoners and an end to the persecution of opponents\\" and also asked for the life and safety of Venezuelans. * Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights - President Kerry Kennedy said she is \\"deeply concerned about the deaths during protests, censorship and intimidation against members of the press, and arrests of students and opposition leaders\\" and condemned \\"government repression of peaceful demonstrators and the arrest of elected officials\\". * Socialist International ‚Äì Socialist International said they understood the causes for protest because of \\"people being killed and injured, opposition leaders being persecuted, with restrictions on freedoms, including the freedom of information, amongst others\\". Socialist International also condemned the deaths of protesters asking the government to stop irregular groups that shot protesters from acting with impunity. * Washington Office on Latin America ‚Äì called for \\"renewed commitment to dialogue on behalf of the government and protesters alike\\", and encouraged \\"both President Maduro and opposition leaders to take every opportunity to unequivocally condemn acts of violence, regardless of the source.\\" * Hackers from multiple countries, including the internet vigilante group Anonymous, have infiltrated Venezuelan government websites due to the alleged repression and censorship of the people in Venezuela. A member of Anonymous said, \\"I would say this is one of the biggest cooperative operations involving South American Anons and Anons from the rest of the world to date\\" when members of another hacker group, LulzSec Peru, also hacked into the government's United Socialist Party of Venezuela Twitter official account. * International celebrities DJ Steve Aoki, Cher and Rihanna all asked for prayers and peace in Venezuela. At the 2014 Oscars, Jared Leto said in solidarity with the opposition during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor, \\"To all the dreamers out there around the world watching this tonight in places like Ukraine and Venezuela, I want to say we are here, and as you struggle to make your dreams happen and live the impossible, we are thinking of you tonight.\\" Also, during the 2014 Oscars, Kevin Spacey said, \\"Venezuela don't give up, everybody has the right to express themselves!\\" with Forest Whitaker also saying he was \\"deeply saddened by the violence in Venezuela\\" and that, \\"Everybody has the right to have their voice heard.\\" Madonna took sides with the opposition saying, \\"Apparently Maduro is not familiar with the phrase \\"Human Rights\\"! Fascism is alive and thriving in Venezuela and Russia.\\" Singers Enrique Iglesias, Willie Col√≥n, and Rub√©n Blades also supported the opposition, with Blades criticizing President Maduro for not being able to \\"direct such a complex country\\". Maduro responded to Blades's criticism by inviting him to the country to perform a peace song along with Maduro which Blades turned down.

The insignia recognizes those members of the Navy's enlisted force who have acquired the specific professional skills, knowledge, and military experience that result in qualification for service in the information warfare activities of the Navy. The EIWS warfare designation program (formerly Enlisted Information Dominance Warfare Specialist (EIDWS)) was implemented in 2010 to qualify Information Warfare Corps (IWC) personnel in the aerographer's mate (AG), cryptologic technician (CT), intelligence specialist (IS), information systems technician (IT), and Operation Specialist (OS) ratings. Attainment of EIDWS designation signifies that an eligible Sailor has achieved a level of excellence and proficiency in Information Dominance (ID). Additionally, the EIWS insignia means the Sailor is competent in his or her rating and has acquired additional general knowledge to enhance his or her understanding of the role of the Information Dominance Corps (IDC) as it pertains to warfighting, mission effectiveness, and command survivability. Sailors can earn EIWS qualification only through a formal qualification program. Prerequisite for EIWS The basic prerequisite for the Enlisted Information Warfare Specialist insignia is that a service member be assigned to a command under administrative command of the NAVIDFOR. In addition to all commands under Administrative Control (ADCON) to NAVIDFOR after Oct 1, 2014, the following commands are authorized to manage an EIDWS program: * Fleet Cyber Command (FCC) * Naval Strike and Air Warfare Command (NSAWC) * Naval Network Warfare Command (NAVNETWARCOM) * Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) * Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NAVMETOCCOM) * Navy Information Dominance Corps Reserve Command (IDCRC) * Numbered Fleet Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) * Unified Combatant Command (COCOM) Joint Intelligence Operations Centers (JIOC) * Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) * Defense Information System Agency (DISA) * Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) * Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG) * Special Reconnaissance TEAM 1 and TEAM 2 (SPECRECON TEAM 1/ 2) * Navy Expeditionary Intelligence Command (NEIC) * Center for Information Dominance Units; Corry Station, Monterey, Hampton Roads and San Diego * Ships of CVN, LHD, LCC, LPD or LHA designation * Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Units 1 and 2 Qualification process The qualification process to obtain the insignia begins with the Enlisted Information Personal Qualification Standards, also known as PQS. There are three PQS for the Enlisted Information Warfare Specialist insignia. The first is the Common Core which consists of concepts, policies, and tasks that are common throughout information warfare and provide a foundation for the sailor's knowledge. The second is a platform-specific PQS which consists of both classified and unclassified information outlining the intelligence community and how the prescribed platform conducts its mission within the community. The third book comprises command specific material that is classified encompassing the full mission of each command that administers the program. The entire PQS normally takes approximately one year to complete from the point of enrolling in the program. First-term sailors will have 30 months to complete the qualification. E-5 and above initial qualifiers will receive 18 months and all re-qualifications will have 12 months. Those completing the Enlisted PQS must then pass a written examination and a review board conducted by senior enlisted personnel, normally the rank of Chief Petty Officer or above. Upon passing both the examination and the oral board, the Enlisted Information Warfare Specialist insignia may be presented. An enlisted person who has qualified for his or her EIWS pin places the designator IW after his or her rate and rating; for example, Cryptologic Technician Collection Second Class Jones, having qualified for his EIWS pin, is identified as CTR2(IW) Jones. If attached to a command within the information warfare community, IW will be the primary designator. For example, IT2(IW/SW) Moore. Upon transfer to the sailor's next command, he or she is required to complete an abbreviated re-qualification process to familiarize the sailor with the differences between various platforms. This process must be completed within 12 months of reporting aboard or the sailor loses the right to wear the EIWS insignia and may receive punitive measures such as an SP evaluation. The Enlisted Information Warfare Specialist insignia is not required for continued advancement in the Navy, however for those in information warfare rates the insignia must be obtained by three years as a Petty Officer Second Class. Those failing to obtain the insignia may be ineligible for advancement to Petty Officer First Class, or reenlistment in their current rate. The Enlisted Information Warfare Specialist insignia is the primary insignia of the enlisted Information Warfare Community, though members outside the community may qualify if assigned to a command with an EIWS program (YN, CS, LS, LN, MA, Seabees). In 2014, NAVIDFOR substantially revised previous instruction COMNAVCYBERFORINST 1414.1B to align requirements and the number of commands authorized to run their own EIWS program.

Kaiser's service began in April 1861 as she left for St. Louis, Missouri. She soon after witnessed the battle of Carthage and felt inspired to get involved in the war effort. Kaiser soon found a service opportunity at the United States Post Hospital where she left her name to be called upon if needed. In the meantime, she remained in St. Louis to help the soldiers as she could. For example, Kaiser often wrote letters to prominent community members asking for supplies. During this time, Kaiser stayed at a hotel in St. Louis and served out of her own good will and expense. On August 29, 1861, Kaiser traveled to Rolla, Missouri for service. Upon her arrival, Kaiser immediately noticed rampant disease: measles, fevers, colds, and even homesickness. Much like in St. Louis, supplies were incredibly scarce. In September of the same year, Kaiser committed to service in the Jefferson Barracks Hospital where she saw a great need for assistance. Once again, she took it upon herself to garner supplies for the severely under-stocked hospital. Kaiser also took up the cleaning of the ward. Though there weren't many injured or ill patients, Kaiser did not a fear that men from the regiments had been taken as prisoners of war. As new patients arrived, however, Kaiser took on work that typically was completed by the doctor in addition to her nursing duties. Despite her best efforts, on November 1, a soldier reported Kaiser, alleging that she did not give him enough food despite the scarcity of food and rations. Kaiser persisted in her efforts. A new doctor and steward arrived during her service, but they weren't attentive to the needs of their patients. Kaiser, once again, took on the extra work without complaint. Even with all of her work, the hospital was severely neglected, which was frustrating for Kaiser. In February 1862, Kaiser transferred to the Benton Barracks. Her work load did not decrease, however; Kaiser acted as a supervisor and a nurse, as well as overseeing kitchen and laundry operations. When the opportunity presented itself, Kaiser followed the regiment to Pittsburgh Landing to battle. Despite numerous objections, Kaiser boarded a hospital ship heading to the battleground. Once the battle at Shiloh completed, Kaiser remained at the battlefield to help evacuate and treat the wounded soldiers. Kaiser soon repeated this experience at the Battle of Vicksburg: she left for battle on May 17, 1863. During her service at Vicksburg, Kaiser met both General Grant and General Sherman. Once again, Kaiser helped evacuate wounded soldiers via hospital ship. Kaiser resigned from the service in June 1864 after over three years of service. The saddest part of her entire experience, according to Kaiser, was not only seeing the horror of war first hand, but especially writing letters to the wives and mothers of deceased servicemen.

Hearst Castle's Gothic Suite designed and painted by Camille Solon Early life Camille A. Solon was one of nine children born to Marie Antoinette Laure Arnoux and Louis Marc Solon. He was born on 27 March 1877 in Stoke-on-Trent, the centre of England's pottery industry. His mother was the daughter of L√©on Arnoux, art director of Mintons Limited. His father had joined the same firm in 1870 and became the preeminent master of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te technique of porcelain decoration. Minton vases designed by Camille Solon's father in the p√¢te-sur-p√¢te style, 1880, on display at Mount Holyoke College Art Museum In 1887, at the age of ten, Solon enrolled at Cotton College, a boarding school in a rural part of Staffordshire.

Work  Roman Pool (Hearst Castle)In 1914 Solon immigrated to California and joined his brother Albert Solon, who was the pottery director at Arequipa Sanatorium in Fairfax, California. Arequipa was a ceramic therapy program for patients recovering from tuberculosis. Albert Solon later founded Solon and Schemmel Tile Company and Camille Solon likely worked at his brother's company early on. Albert's company, now known as Stonelight Tile, is one of only three major California tile manufacturers from the 1920s to have survived to the present. Hearst Castle Roman Pool From 1925-1940 Solon was a designer and art director for William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon. Solon designed the blue-and-gold Venetian glass tile mosaics used in the indoor Roman Pool at Hearst Castle. The mosaics that cover the walls, ceiling, and pool are made up of one-inch square smalti glass and fused gold tiles. The inspiration for the designs came from the 5th Century Mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Solon also designed and painted the murals in the Gothic Suite of Casa Grande's private 3rd floor. In the 1940s, he worked with Julia Morgan to design murals and decorative details for the Chapel of the Chimes crematorium in Oakland. He also designed, ‚ÄúThe Creation,‚Äù an interior mural in the Temple of Religion and Tower of Peace building at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco.  Personal life  The Arnoux family had been well established in the European pottery and ceramic industry for over 300 years, dating back to Toulouse in the late seventeenth century. Many of Solon's siblings also became respected artisans in their own right. In 1920, Solon married Sylvia Wallace, a fellow British immigrant. As he aged, Solon suffered from failing eyesight and used a beloved German Shepherd guide dog to aid him. Solon died in Marin County on 8 January 1960 and was buried at Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery in San Rafael.

He joined a volunteer regiment in 1792. He fought in the Italian campaign of 1796 and participated in the French invasion of Egypt in 1798. He became a general of brigade in 1801 and took part in the Expedition to Saint-Domingue in 1802. While sailing back to France he was captured by the British. After being exchanged, he fought at Jena and Pultusk in 1806, Friedland in 1807 and Wagram in 1809. Transferred to Spain, Boyer led a dragoon division at Salamanca and Battle of Venta del Pozo in 1812 and Vitoria in 1813. He earned the nickname \\"Pedro the Cruel\\" for brutal actions against Spanish partisans. He led an infantry division at the Nivelle and the Nive in late 1813. His division was transferred to the fighting near Paris and he was promoted general of division in February 1814. He led his troops at Mormant, Craonne, Laon and Arcis-sur-Aube. Because Boyer rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he was compelled to flee to Germany for a short time. After he was retired in 1824, he helped train the army of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Restored to active service after the July Revolution of 1830, he was placed in command of Oran during the French conquest of Algeria. His superior complained about his harshness toward the local people, but Boyer was not relieved until 1833. He retired from active service in 1839 and died in 1851. BOYER is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 7. Spain Boyer was chief of staff in Jean- Andoche Junot's VIII Corps during Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na's invasion of Portugal in 1810. The VIII Corps was held in reserve at the Battle of Bussaco but was involved in a skirmish with the British in the Battle of Sobral on 13‚Äì14 October 1810. 1814 On 19 January 1814, Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult received the order to begin the transfer of the infantry divisions of Boyer and Jean Fran√ßois Leval to Napoleon's army operating near Paris. They began their march on 21 January. Boyer's division left behind Jean-Baptiste Pierre Menne's brigade, the 118th and 120th Line Infantry Regiments, and instead took David Hendrik Chass√©'s brigade, the 16th Light, 8th Line and 28th Line. Boyer received promotion to general of division on 16 February 1814. A detachment under √âtienne Gauthier arrived in time to join Marshal Nicolas Oudinot's corps for the Battle of Mormant on 17 February. Present were two battalions each of the 2nd Light and 122nd Line and one battalion each of the 24th Line and 33rd Line. The 33rd was a new unit of conscripts that joined along the way. On 22 February, Antoine Gruyer led 3,600 men of the 2nd Light, 24th Line, 36th Line and 122nd Line plus the 6th Chevau-l√©ger Lancers in an attack on M√©ry-sur- Seine. There were 5,000 Russians and 1,200 Prussians in opposition. Both sides suffered about 800 casualties including Gruyer wounded. Chass√©'s 2nd Brigade, which was made up of the 16th Light, 8th Line, 28th and 54th Line, was not engaged. In the action, the French overran the village of M√©ry, but were unable to hold the part of the town on the north bank in the face of an Allied counterattack. Boyer later reported that the army of Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher was moving west along the Seine River. This alerted Napoleon that the Prussian general might be trying to cut his communications with Paris. On 27 February, Napoleon followed Blucher's army which had moved northwest toward Meaux. At this time, Gruyer's brigade, under Boyer, was attached to Napoleon's army. Boyer's other brigade was left in the south with the army of Marshal Jacques MacDonald. Boyer's brigade was involved in a skirmish with Russian forces on 6 March. The next day during the Battle of Craonne, Boyer's brigade operated with Marshal Michel Ney's Young Guard corps. That morning Ney prematurely launched the divisions of Boyer and Claude Marie Meunier against the Russian left flank. Because Ney failed to provide artillery support, the initial attacks failed. When the French guns arrived, Meunier and Boyer's troops fought a costly battle with their enemies for several hours. At 2:30 pm, Boyer's men finally captured the village of Ailles on the extreme French right flank. For the rest of the day, Boyer followed up the Russian withdrawal.

Often referred to as \\"el poeta villero\\" (the poet from the ghetto), his popularity has grown since he published his first book, La Venganza del Cordero Atado, in 2010, soon after completing imprisonment in a youth detention center for the fourth time. The publication of La Venganza del Cordero Atado included illustrations from , Argentinean plastic artist who became interested in his work and who also worked on the album art of renowned artists such as Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, Charly Garcia and Frank Zappa. In light of the fact that he, quite unusually, pursued a career in the arts after a difficult upbringing that involved time in prison, he has labelled to himself as \\"the exception that confirms the rule\\". This aspect of his character and background has, at times, attracted attention from a number of cultural journalists and literary critics in Argentina. Because of his own experience and him being an avid reader of philosophers, sociologists and anthropologists including Gilles Deleuze, Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, his work often appoints the issues of social stigmatization towards the villas or ghettos both in Argentina and the rest of the world, and the violence of the jail system. Besides his published books and his movies, he is involved in many projects that attempt to link and visibilize the artistic movements from several villas, including writing for magazines and music video productions for rappers like \\"El As\\" (from Fuerte Apache) Fili Wey (from Puerta de Hierro) and Alan Garvey (as Gonz√°lez, from Villa Gardel).

History  The majority of the diplomatic visits between the two countries have been visits by Swazi officials, often to attend the annual CII-EXIM Bank Africa Conclaves and other multilateral events. From India, the highest level visits to Swaziland have been at the level of minister of state. The Minister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur and the Minister of State for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation visited Swaziland in May 2011 and July 2015 respectively. Both ministers met with King Mswati III. King Mswati III met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during the second India‚ÄìAfrica Forum Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in May 2011. He made the first ever visit by a Swazi King to India in October‚ÄìNovember 2015 to attend the third India Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi. Mswati met with President Pranab Mukherjee on 27 October, and with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the following day. Apart from other government officials, the King was accompanied by 15 wives, 30 children and 100 servants. Mswati made his second visit to India in March 2017, accompanied by a 70-member delegation including ministers of foreign affairs, trade, economic planning, health and agriculture. Unlike the previous visit, the King brought only one of his wives and one child. The Indian Express described the move as a sign that the trip was \\"strictly business\\". Mswati met with Prime Minister Modi and President Mukherjee, was the guest of honour at the CII-EXIM Bank Conclave, and also participated in Holi festivities. He also visited Anand, Gujarat to learn about animal husbandry and dairy farming practices, as well as Rajasthan and Gurgaon. Mswati sought India's assistance to establish a science park and renewable energy infrastructure in Swaziland. Following his return to Swaziland, Mswati stated that Swaziland would benefit from the SZL 131 billion financial assistance that India had pledged to African countries at the CII- EXIM Bank Conclave. India voted against Swaziland's proposal to legalise the international sale of white rhino horns at the 17th Conference of the Parties (CoP 17) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) held in Johannesburg, South Africa in October 2016. The proposal was defeated with 100 countries voting against, 26 in favour and 17 abstained. Swaziland's supports India's candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.  Trade  Bilateral trade between India and Swaziland totaled US$61.97 million in 2014-15, declining by 58% from the previous fiscal year. India exported $39.94 million worth of goods to Swaziland, and imported $22.03 million. While India's exports to Swaziland grew by 76.49% from 2013-14 to 2014-15, its imports from the country declined by 82.35% during the same period. The main commodities exported by India to Swaziland are pharmaceutical products, gold and precious metal jewellery, pearl/semi-precious stones, industrial machinery, fertilizers, Shellac, organic chemicals, aluminum products and electric machinery and equipment. The major commodities imported by India from Swaziland are industrial machinery, gold, residual chemical, medical and scientific instruments, pharmaceuticals, organic chemicals, electrical machinery, electronic instruments, pearls and semi-precious stones.

By January 1677, nearly all coastal towns from Surabaya to Cirebon (except Jepara) were taken.  Background  The Trunajaya rebellion began in 1674 as Trunajaya's forces conducted raids against the cities under Mataram control. In 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 invaded East Java from their base in Madura, and took Surabaya ‚Äì the principal city of East Java ‚Äì shortly after. Mataram King Amangkurat I sent a large army to oppose him under the Crown Prince (later Amangkurat II), but this army was decisively defeated on 13 September at the Battle of Gegodog in northeast Java. After Gegodog, the Javanese north coast was open to Trunajaya's forces.  Offensive  The rebel forces quickly proceeded westwards after the victory. The Javanese northern coastal region ‚Äì also known as the Pasisir ‚Äì contained many trading towns, such as Surabaya (already taken by Trunajaya before Gegodog), Tuban, Juwana, Pati, Jepara, Semarang and Kendal. Trunajaya's forces met their first significant resistance in Jepara. In response to the rebellion, Amangkurat had installed a military man, Angabei Wangsadipa as governor in Jepara overseeing the entire northern coast. Subsequently, the town's defenses had been reinforced and additional cannons had been placed. Jepara's defender also had help from a Dutch East India Company (VOC) force of 200 men, who was reinforced by sea \\"just in time\\". They arrived there on 20 November 1676 and begin besieging the city. The joint Mataram-VOC defense, as well as with quarrel between the Madurese and Makassarese elements of the attackers, caused the attack to ultimately fail. After failing to take Jepara, Trunajaya's captains ‚Äì whose forces were augmented by Javanese defectors eager for booty ‚Äì attacked other towns along the coast. The attacks were made easy because many towns had their fortifications dismantled during or after their conquest by Mataram's Sultan Agung about five decades before. Trading-towns were laid in ruin and ships were taken over to carry out further attacks. According to H. J. de Graaf, Mataram troops conducted \\"courageous\\" defenses of Kudus and Demak, but they ultimately fell. In 5 January 1677, Trunajaya reached as far west as Cirebon and took the town, after other coastal towns (except Jepara) had been taken or forced to acknowledge Trunajaya's authority. VOC forces in their Batavia headquarters prevented a further westward advance.

Phytocosmetics is a part of cosmetology, which consists of using plants in cosmetics. The popularization of the use of plants in cosmetics is attributed to the fact that these additives do not need regulation, being considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration, in addition to providing different benefits offered by the vast composition of plants that for the most part are known and enshrined by popular medicine.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia were part of the 1972 United States presidential election. Iowa voters chose eight electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Iowa was won by the Republican nominees, incumbent President Richard Nixon of California and his running mate Vice President Spiro Agnew of Maryland. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic nominees, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and his running mate U.S. Ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland. Nixon carried Iowa with 57.61 percent of the vote to McGovern's 40.48 percent, a victory margin of 17.13 percent. This would be the last time until Donald Trump in 2016 when a Republican presidential candidate won Wapello County and Des Moines County.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Statewide results =Results by county= {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" -

Notice  Title page of the Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de Luigi Boccherini, suivie du catalogue raisonn√© de toutes ses ≈ìuvres, tant publi√©es qu'in√©dites, Paris, 1851. Although Picquot had a job far from music - he was a tax collector in Bar-le-Duc - his work reached a general recognition. among musicologists, musicians, music historians, publishers etc. In his patient compilation effort, Picquot contacted all those who may have information and documents about the composer, particularly Fran√ßois de Fossa (who played the Quintets with guitar), or the son, Josef Mariano and grandson Fernando, as well as his widow. The 135-page book, published in 1851, was printed \\"at Philips, a publisher of music,\\" with a long title, as was customary at the time, but at the same time modest, for he opted for the word \\"Notice\\" to describe it. For decades, Picquot's work was the core of Boccherinian studies, since it was far superior to the content of the Biographie universelle by F√©tis. The book was reprinted only in 1930, by Georges de Saint- FoixBoccherini: notes et documents nouveaux (and a translation, in Spanish, with three context studies, in 2005). Georges de Saint-Foix, a musicologist, added a 45-page introduction, where he corrected many errors and added new data collected by other researchers or by himself. Today, Picquot is still an important Boccherinian source, on condition of being aware of the inevitable gaps and errors and also of some blurred opinions..
