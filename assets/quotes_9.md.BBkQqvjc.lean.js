He was also widely known for his laudable usage of the Turkish language. Early life Boran was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1928 as the son of Hikmet Boran, a graduate of the medical college. At the age of ten, Orhan enrolled at the famed Galatasaray High School, where he was a boarder even on weekends. His first stage experience came when he was still at Galatasaray as he took part in school drama productions. The plays were directed by Necdet Mahfi Ayral, a fine actor with the Municipal Theaters, and Boran had the leading role. Career Boran's stage career was launched when he graduated from high school in 1946. A year after joining the ranks of the Municipal Theaters, Boran found the opportunity to go to Paris and work as an intern with a theater known as Les Mathurins. He came back to Turkey in 1949, feeling that the theater was not for him. That same year, when Radio Istanbul went on the air, he ‚Äòfound his calling,‚Äô as he puts it. The programs he did then, at the age of 21, gave him instant celebrity. And it was at this time that he began doing one-man stints in night clubs, laying the foundations for the Stand-up Banter that has become synonymous with the name Orhan Boran. In 1956, by taking first place in an examination given by the British Consulate in Istanbul, Orhan Boran found himself in London, where he worked for the Turkish service of the BBC. He was also London correspondent for the Turkish daily news Dunya. His success as a correspondent was to bring him within the sphere of H√ºrriyet and Milliyet, leading Turkish newspapers, and start his 25 years in print. On returning to Turkey in 1960 he quickly went back into radio. It was also at this time that the 'Stand-up Banter' performances began, forerunners of today's stand-up comedy in modern Turkey. Boran's stories were mostly based on his imaginary family and the conversations between the family members. At a time when he hosted nearly all the radio quiz programs in Turkey, he also created a famous fictitious character named Yuki (a rabbit- like character voiced by Boran himself) for a radio show during the 1960s. Boran created other characters besides Yuki, entertaining listeners for years and years with the stories of the derelict brother-in-law, the sister-in-law doomed to be an old maid, and many more. In the late 1990s, an animation version of Yuki based on scripts taken from the early radio programs was produced as a series of for television, however, because of the marketing problems, it failed to hit the screen. Boran ended his long stage career in 1981 with a show called A Musical Belly-Laugh, written by himself and featuring a number of artists. He then started to host his own television programs: Panel, Hello Friends (Merhaba Arkada≈ülar), Sunday Nights With Orhan Boran (Orhan Boran ile Pazar Geceleri), and Moments With Orhan Boran (Orhan Boran'lƒ± Dakikalar). Having won numerous awards from the Ministry of Culture and the Turkish Language Association, Boran in 1992 joined the faculty of the Marmara University School of Communications in order to share what he had learned with the younger generation who have always meant so much to him. But although he loved being an academic, his heavy work schedule forced him to resign from this post. After 59 years, Boran retired from show business on 10 June 2005. Orhan Boran died on 26 May 2012 at the age of 83. He had been suffering from bone marrow disease for two years. He was laid to rest at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery following the religious funeral ceremony held in Galippa≈üa Mosque in Erenk√∂y, Kadƒ±k√∂y.

In 1861, Fairbank was hired by Julia Macklem to survey 100 acres of land in Oil Springs that she purchased from Charles Tripp and subdivide the property into 198 half-acre lots. After finishing the surveying job, Fairbank leased a half-acre plot of land from James Miller Williams and began to dig for oil, naming the well \\"Old Fairbank.\\" Although the fluctuation in the price of oil in 1862-1863 nearly drove Fairbank to bankruptcy, his fortunes reversed in November 1863 when he netted $150 in profit in a single day. An upturn in the oil market in 1863-1864 further benefited Fairbank, and through steady reinvestment of his profits, he became the largest oil producer in Canada until the early 1900s. In 1865, Fairbank sold his half acre property at Oil Springs for $6000 and relocated to Petrolia, Ontario. = Jerker-line Pumping System = In the mid-1860s, Fairbank developed the jerker-line pumping system, which was ideally suited to the closely spaced, low-output oil wells in Lambton County. In this system, wooden rods connected to a single power source pumped dozens of wells at the same time. Before the invention of jerker-line system, a steam engine was required at each well. The resulting cost savings made it economically viable to pump hundreds of small oil wells that otherwise would have had to be abandoned and made it possible to work wells that were too deep and \\"too hard to work by manpower.\\" Fairbank never patented the jerker-line system, thinking that the invention did not qualify for patent protection. The jerker-line system quickly spread after its creation in Petrolia as Lambton oil drillers utilized the invention when opening up oil fields in Central Europe, Indonesia, Mexico, the Middle East and South America. = Career in Petrolia = After arriving in Petrolia in 1865, Fairbank opened a grocery and liquor store in partnership with Benjamin Van Tuyl. Quickly after its foundation, the store expanded into hardware and oil-well fittings. Above the store there was a room known as \\"Fairbank Hall,\\" which served as a meeting place for oil producers before the construction of the Oil Exchange Hall in 1871. The store closed in November 2019. In 1866, Fairbank led local efforts to build a spur line that would connect Petrolia to the Great Western Railway line at Wyoming. The producers sold the track to the railway company in late 1866 for the cost of construction and it quickly became one of the most profitable railway branches built in Canada due to the shipment of oil.Phelps, Charles. (1965) John Henry Fairbank of Petrolia (1831-1914): A Canadian Entrepreneur (Master‚Äôs Thesis). Western University. p.54. In 1869, Fairbank and Leonard Vaugh established Petrolia's first bank, known locally as \\"the little red bank\\" due to the colour of the building. Thirteen years later, Fairbank, Jacob Englehart and other businessmen from Petrolia formed the Crown Savings and Loan Company. Throughout the 1870s, Fairbank took the lead in forming various producer groups that sought to limit production of oil to market demand and combat the growing power of oil refiners. Alongside 105 other oil producers, Fairbank joined the Lambton Crude Oil Partnership in June 1871, but the association was abandoned when the price of oil collapsed in 1873.Following the Lambton Crude Oil Partnerships' collapse, Fairbank and other oil producers formed the Home Oil Works Company. Fairbank was appointed President and Manager of Home Oil for eight years and the company constructed a refinery in Petrolia that was capable of refining 3,000 barrels of oil per week. In 1892, Fairbank came into possession of a refinery in partnership with Samuel Rogers and Company of Toronto after its owners declared bankruptcy.Phelps, Charles.

History Recorded in 2005, Magic Fingers is a showcase of the Balinese guitarist I Wayan Balawan's ability in arranging, composing and his blending of musical styles, combining guitar playing with the traditional instruments of Bali. This album contains eleven tracks. The short opening instrumental, \\"Prelude\\", is followed by \\"Magic Reong\\", an instrumental with two people playing a Balinese reong, believed to be one of the most difficult instruments to play because of the complicated accent and pattern combination. There is also a kecak part as an introduction before Balawan's rocking guitar solos began. The third song is \\"Semua bisa bilang\\", a famous Indonesian song in the 1970s. Balawan rearranged this song with European gipsy jazz bossanova styles with accordion and violin, with Balawan's soft singing style reminiscent of Chet Baker. \\"Sesaat Kau Hadir\\" is another famous Indonesian hit from the 1980s, rearranged with a mix of many Balinese instruments (gangsa, kendang, cengceng). A famous Balinese traditional song, \\"The Dances of Janger\\", with an extra introduction, showcases Balawan guitar playing with two gangsa players, technically a very difficult song to play. \\"Menanti\\" is an original Balawan song with bass guitar, Balinese drum, percussion, flute and Balawan's voice. \\"Mainz in My Mind\\" has Balawan tapping his guitar, sounding like a pianist. \\"Arti Kehidupan\\", originally by Mus Mujiono and written by the famous Indonesian songwriter Oddie Agam, is rearranged with simple guitar, bass guitar, drum and a romantic voice. \\"Trade wind\\" is a Brazilian-style instrumental with Balawan's acoustic guitar playing and composition. \\"Like a Bird\\" is the only song in English on this album, composed as a modern R'n'B style with a mix of Balinese gamelan instruments. The closing track on this album is \\"Country Beleganjur\\" with a Balinese cengceng (similar to cymbals) performed by four people playing a complicated syncopation of Balinese music.

For the Metropolitan Opera, she played Adele in the national tour of Garson Kanin's production of Die Fledermaus, from 1951 to 1952. MacWatters's house debut was also as Adele, with Regina Resnik, and, later, Eleanor Steber, as Rosalinde von Eisenstein. From 1953 to 1955, she was also heard there in La boh√®me, opposite Victoria de los √Ångeles as Mim√¨. She returned to the Met in 1957, for Fiakermilli in Arabella, with Lisa della Casa conducted by Erich Leinsdorf. In 1957, a twenty-five year dual performing and teaching career began for MacWatters at Indiana University when she was offered a position on the voice faculty. Known as \\"Miss Mac\\" to her students, her devotion to teaching was apparent. In 1979, she was awarded IU's most prestigious honor, the Frederic Bachman Lieber Memorial Award for excellence in teaching.

Contents The Wilderness Survival Guide covers adventures in the wilderness, including rules and guidelines for weather and its effects, encumbrance and movement, hunting, camping, first aid, natural hazards, fatigue, beasts of burden, and handling combat and magic in the wilderness. The book also details new equipment and skills, called proficiencies, pertaining to the wilderness. The book provides an overview of the types of wilderness, including desert, forest, hills, mountains, plains, coastal areas, and swamps. Much of the material in the book details the environment, about terrains, major wilderness hazards, and weather. The book also covers PC resources, such as: adding to the proficiency system introduced in the Dungeoneer's Survival Guide; appropriate clothing for different climates; clarifying normal vision, infravision and ultravision; details on mounts; and rules on encumbrance and movement rates in the wilderness. The book also details how the environment affects PC activities, and includes new information on survival techniques, air and waterborne travel, combat in unusual circumstances, and magic. In addition to new abilities, the Wilderness Survival Guide introduces difficulties and handicaps that players will have to cope with, such as the effects of sleeping in armor and the ease with which a fire can get out of hand. The book includes a short section entitled Starting from Scratch that shows how to design a bit of topography using a step-by-step method of creating a viable environment. It includes tables dealing with encumbrance (for characters and animals), effects of wind on missile fire and waterborne vehicle characteristics, including modifiers for a thief's climbing rates, climbing for non-thieves, temperature effects and damage, reactions of animals, and effects of lack of sleep. Most of the tables are reprinted at the back of the book, where there are also three pages containing different sizes of hex. Publication history Kim Mohan began working on the Wilderness Survival Guide in early April 1986, and he spent his time researching the wilderness and figuring how to translate this knowledge into rules for AD&D.; The book features cover art by Jeff Easley, and was published by TSR in 1986 as a 128-page hardcover. The book features interior illustrations by Mark Nelson, Jim Holloway, Easley, Larry Elmore, and Valerie Valusek. The book was repackaged with a totally new book of adventures, called Wild Things, and released in 1990, as a way to get rid of excess copies of the first edition of Wilderness Survival Guide.http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=9271 Reception Carl Sargent reviewed Wilderness Survival Guide for White Dwarf No. 85, stating that a good wilderness adventure rulebook is hard to write, because of the lack of sharp discontinuities as opposed to dungeon adventures, although \\"Mohan has pulled it off brilliantly.\\" Sargent called the weather system \\"splendid\\", and felt that the rules on encumbrance and movement rates \\"make sense and work easily\\". He noted some odd details, such as a draft horse being able to carry 80% of the load of an elephant, and the fact that druids gain wilderness proficiencies slower than any other class. However, he felt that \\"for every error there are a dozen good points of details; the WSG gets proficiency checks 'right', correcting a major DSG error\\". He felt that the book provides valuable material not only for AD&D;, but for any D&D;, RuneQuest, or Middle-earth Role Playing game master. Sargent praised Kim Mohan's writing style, calling the book \\"the best written rulebook I've ever read; indeed, for style and content the WSG is the best AD&D; book to date\\". Sargent concluded his review by stating, \\"This book will revolutionize wilderness adventuring. It makes the wilderness more challenging, dangerous and exciting than almost any dungeon ‚Ä¶ Simply, the Wilderness Survival Guide is absolutely terrific.‚Äù Robin Parry reviewed the Wilderness Survival Guide for the British magazine Adventurer #7 (February 1987). He points out the need for a DM to be prepared to deal with facts concerning the natural (and unnatural) world, in order to run a credible campaign: \\"No book can completely alleviate the need to develop the odd interest in, say, geology or obscure tribal customs, but the Wilderness Survival Guide answers most of the questions likely to be asked when players venture in the wilds.\\" He comments that the book \\"deals with the many aspects of outdoor adventuring [...] with comprehensive clarity\\". He calls the Starting from Scratch section \\"sensible\\" and wonders \\"why this section is reserved for the Dungeon Master's eyes only, as it is no more revealing of pertinent facts than the rest of the book\\". He felt that the information on weather \\"is dealt with, as completely as anyone but the most niggling simulationist could wish. The system presented is eminently usable and covers (as do all the climatic bits) the tropic, the arctic, and everything in between.\\" He found some of the tables particularly useful, \\"although all the tables should prove valuable sooner or later\\". Parry complimented the look of the book: \\"Another admirable Jeff Easley illustration graces the cover, the drawings inside range from good to poor. Printing and production are, as usual, good; no typos or glaring gaps.\\" He also complimented the writing: \\"Kim Mohan has written a worthy companion volume to Doug Niles' Dungeon Survival Guide, especially considering that the subject is much broader.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #36 (Feb 1987) References Dungeons & Dragons books ","title":"Wilderness Survival Guide"},{"id":"13238029","text":"Salisbury Center Bridge is the only covered bridge in Herkimer County, New York State.

In the U.S. state of New York, US 219 extends from the Pennsylvania state line at Carrollton to an interchange with the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) at exit 55 in West Seneca, southeast of downtown Buffalo. In Cattaraugus County, the area surrounding US 219 is predominantly rural. However, in northern Cattaraugus County, US 219 becomes an expressway leading through Erie County and into the heart of Buffalo. The route serves the villages of Ellicottville and Springville, where it meets New York State Route 242 (NY 242) and NY 39, respectively, and indirectly serves Hamburg via NY 391\\\\. The path of US 219 in New York mostly follows that of New York State Route 62, a route assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York that extended from Great Valley north to Buffalo via Ellicottville, the hamlet of Ashford, Springville, and Hamburg. From Ellicottville to Springville, NY 62 utilized modern NY 242 and NY 240\\\\. It was renumbered to NY 75 , and became part of US 219 from Hamburg south when the U.S. Highway was extended into New York . The section north of Ellicottville has been realigned in the years since to follow a two- lane road from Ellicottville to Springville and the Southern Expressway from Springville to West Seneca. Long-term plans for the expressway call for it to extend from West Seneca south to Salamanca. Route description =Cattaraugus County= US 219 crosses the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania border at Carrollton. The road begins by heading northward towards the Southern Tier Expressway, paralleling Tunungwant Creek. Just after the Pennsylvania border, East Main Street becomes Hillside Drive and soon after Old U.S. Route 219 as it parallels US 219 for a short time. The road quickly merges into the current alignment as the U.S. route enters the hamlet of Limestone. A second incarnation of Old Route 219 parallels the U.S. route throughout Limestone. The road merges in just north of Limestone and US 219 continues northward. South Nine Mile Road (County Route 30 or CR 30) leaves to the right just before the road merges into the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY 17). Also present at this intersection is US 219 Business. The three roads overlap for six miles (10 km) until exit 21, where US 219 leaves the Southern Tier Expressway in Salamanca. Southbound on US 219 in Limestone. At right, a sign indicates that the road has at-grade intersections for the next . US 219 crosses through the city of Salamanca and heads north towards Ellicottville. While in Salamanca, US 219 and NY 417 become concurrent for about one mile (1.6 km). At the end of the concurrency comes the end of the business route. CR 49 terminates just north of Salamanca as US 219 enters Peth. In Peth, CR 67 leaves to the right. In Great Valley, NY 98 leaves to the north. US 219 enters Ellicottville and intersects with NY 242. The two roads become concurrent for a short distance when US 219 turns to the north. Several Cattaraugus County roads intersect in the distance from Ellicottville to the Erie County border. The first is CR 75, the second is a concurrency between CR 53 and CR 85, and the third is CR 12, which has a brief concurrency with US 219 before leaving to the east. After an intersection with CR 77, US 219 has a brief concurrency with CR 85 before it becomes a limited-access highway and crosses Cattaraugus Creek as it enters Erie County. =Erie County= US 219 is a freeway for its entire length in Erie County. About from the county line, US 219 connects to NY 39 at an interchange west of the village of Springville. The highway continues to the northwest, connecting to CR 49 (Genesee Road) later and CR 233 (Rice Road) after another . Five miles later, US 219 encounters NY 391 in Creekside. US 219 southbound at the interchange with NY 179 (Mile Strip Road) in Orchard Park The route continues, connecting to CR 44 (New Armor Duells Road), a highway leading to NY 240 in the village of Orchard Park. Not far to the north is the next interchange with US 20A, which provides access to nearby New Era Field. North of the village but still in the town of Orchard Park, US 219 crosses over US 20 prior to meeting NY 179 at an interchange just north of the US 20 overpass. The highway continues, curving to the northwest as it enters West Seneca and approaches the New York State Thruway (I-90). Instead of immediately merging with the Thruway, US 219 runs parallel to the Thruway for roughly , with the northbound lanes running alongside the east side of the Thruway and the southbound lanes running alongside the west side. The two highways share an interchange with Ridge Road before US 219 finally merges into the Thruway. History =Origins and designation= When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, NY 18 was assigned to an alignment extending from the Pennsylvania state line north of Bradford to downtown Buffalo. NY 18 went north from the state line to Bradford Junction, where it intersected NY 17 (now NY 417), another route assigned in 1924. The two routes converged here and overlapped each other northwest to Salamanca, where NY 17 continued westward toward Jamestown while NY 18 proceeded northwestward toward Little Valley. NY 18 originally connected to PA 6 at the state line; however, by 1929, it connected to US 219 instead. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the highway connecting NY 17 and NY 18 in Salamanca to Great Valley was designated as part of NY 98.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering Assigned at the same time was NY 62, a route extending from Great Valley to NY 18 in downtown Buffalo by way of Ellicottville, Ashford, Springville, and Hamburg. Carollton (former US 219) crossing the New York state line from Pennsylvania US 62 was extended into New York ; as a result, the portion of NY 62 south of Athol Springs was renumbered to NY 75 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway. The remainder of old NY 62 became part of an extended NY 5. US 219 was extended into New York , overlapping NY 18, NY 98, and NY 75 northward to a junction with US 62 in Hamburg. The overlap with NY 75 was eliminated by 1940 when NY 75 was truncated northward to US 62 in Hamburg. The other two overlaps ceased to exist when NY 18 and NY 98 were truncated to Lewiston and Great Valley, respectively. =Realignments= When it was first extended into New York, US 219 continued north from Ellicottville to Springville as it does today; however, it initially overlapped NY 242 between Ellicottville and Ashford and utilized what is now NY 240 between Ashford and Cattaraugus Street southeast of Springville. Within Springville, US 219 was routed along Cattaraugus Street and Buffalo Street and intersected NY 39 in the village center. Outside of the village, US 219 went north on Springville‚ÄìBoston Road and Boston State Road to North Boston, from where US 219 continued to Hamburg by way of modern NY 391. In the early 1950s, construction began on a western bypass of Springville that connected US 219 just north of the village to East Otto Road south of Springville. The portion of the highway north of Waverly Street was completed by 1954. The remainder of the bypass was finished by 1956, at which time US 219 was realigned to follow the bypass around the village. At the south end of the bypass, US 219 continued south to Ellicottville by way of pre-existing, previously unnumbered highways. However, the segment of modern NY 240 vacated by US 219 did not become part of an extended NY 240 until the mid-1960s. In the 1990s, US 219 was rerouted to follow the Southern Tier Expressway between exit 21 in Salamanca and exit 23 just south of Bradford Junction. The old alignment of US 219 through Carrollton and Salamanca became US 219 Business. =Southern Expressway= Construction began in the early 1970s on the Southern Expressway, a limited-access highway connecting Buffalo to Springville. The first segment of the expressway‚Äîbetween the New York State Thruway east of Lackawanna and US 20A west of Orchard Park‚Äîopened to traffic by 1973 as a realignment of US 219\\\\. In between the end of the expressway and North Boston, US 219 temporarily overlapped US 20A and NY 277. The freeway was extended south to North Boston in the mid-1970s and to Springville in the early 1980s. Both segments became part of US 219 upon opening. The former surface routing of US 219 between North Boston and Hamburg was redesignated as NY 391 following the completion of the expressway's first segment in the early 1970s while the remainder of US 219's former routing south to Springville was transferred to Erie County upon the completion of the entire Springville‚ÄìBuffalo segment of the Southern Expressway. 2008 photo of the twin arch bridges that carry the Southern Expressway over Cattaraugus Creek. Both were still under construction at this time. Plans to extend the Southern Expressway southward from NY 39 in Springville to Peters Road in Ashford, a distance of , had been in development for years before they were finally put into action in the mid-2000s. Project specifications called for the installation of a four-lane right-of-way (two lanes in each direction) and the construction of 11 bridges, including twin bridges over Cattaraugus Creek. The number was later revised to nine. Areas near parts of the new freeway were to become a wetland habitat. A portion of NY 39 near the current southern terminus was also reconstructed in 2007 and 2008 to accommodate for the completed interchange with US 219. The rights to the project were awarded to Cold Spring Construction on January 26, 2007, with work commencing on June 1. Altogether, the project was initially expected to cost $86 million and be completed in late 2009. The lengthy construction time was largely due to the need to construct two bridges over the Zoar Valley gorge. As of March 2009, the projected cost of the extension had risen to $116 million. Since 2007, the project had encountered several delays due to landslides in the vicinity of Scoby Hill Road and the need to conduct a second environmental impact study on the road's impact on wetlands in the area. As a result, the $86 million in state funding that was devoted to the project was reallocated to other projects in New York, a move confirmed by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in March 2009. At the same time, however, NYSDOT left open the possibility of eventually restoring the funding. It was restored sometime afterward, and the highway was completed on November 19, 2010, with a total price tag of $125 million. Ownership and maintenance of the former surface alignment of US 219 north of Peters Road‚Äînow known as Miller Road, and including the two-lane, high-level bridge that currently carries it across the valley surrounding Cattaraugus Creek‚Äîwas transferred from the state of New York to Erie and Cattaraugus counties. The two sections of road leading to and from the bridge were transferred immediately while the bridge itself was not turned over until a state-funded rehabilitation project was completed in 2013. The latter half of the plan drew criticism from Erie County officials who believe that the state should continue to maintain the bridge due to its size, importance and the resulting cost of upkeep. Because of safety concerns, the bridge was closed to traffic on January 5, 2012 and remained closed until April of that year while repairs were made to the structure. On July 6, 2014, the New York State Department of Transportation announced the extension of the Western New York Southtowns Scenic Byway, a scenic byway through Erie County from Orchard Park to Springville, into Cattaraugus County. The new extension would involve US 219 from NY 39 in Springville to the Great Valley town line and NY 240 down to NY 39 and NY 242. Future Long-term plans call for the Southern Expressway to be extended southward to the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY 17) in Salamanca. Planning wise, this section comprises four segments of the Southern Expressway, with the first five completed segments reaching from south of Springville to West Seneca. Construction of the remainder of the freeway has been delayed by two major factors: the inability to obtain rights from the Seneca nation that would allow the highway to go through the Allegany Reservation, and the lack of funding due to the state's financial woes. Work on the proposed highway's environmental impact study was suspended indefinitely in June 2009 as a result of the latter. NYSDOT intends to resume work on the study when the state's financial situation improves and funding can be restored to the project. US 219 Business U.S. Route 219 Business is a business route of US 219 that extends for in the vicinity of Salamanca. The southern terminus of the route is at exit 23 of the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY 17) in Carrollton, where US 219 departs the expressway and follows the right-of-way of US 219 Business south to Pennsylvania. The northern terminus of US 219 Business is at an intersection with US 219 and NY 417 in downtown Salamanca. From its northern terminus in Salamanca to the hamlet of Bradford Junction, US 219 Business is concurrent to NY 417. The segment between the I-86 / NY 17 interchange and NY 417 is designated NY 954T, an unsigned reference route. Until the 1990s, US 219 Business was the routing of US 219 through the Salamanca area.

Using these abilities, the player progresses through the game by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces. A preliminary version of Braid (without the final artwork) won the \\"Innovation in Game Design\\" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival, while the final version received additional accolades. The game received universal critical acclaim, eventually becoming the highest rated title on Xbox Live. Some reviewers, however, criticized the game's price relative to its length of play. It is seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development, and Blow and its production were documented in the 2012 film, Indie Game: The Movie. The game had total revenue nearing $6 million, , which Blow used to fund his next game, The Witness, a 3D puzzle game released in 2016. Braid is considered by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time.  Gameplay  Braid is played by solving physical puzzles in a standard platform game environment. The player controls the protagonist Tim as he runs, jumps, and climbs across the game's levels. Tim jumps and stomps on enemies to defeat them, and can collect keys to unlock doors or operate levers to trigger platforms. A defining game element is the player's unlimited ability to reverse time and \\"rewind\\" actions, even after dying. The game is divided into six worlds, which are experienced sequentially and can be entered from different rooms of Tim's house; the player can return to any world previously visited to attempt to solve puzzles they missed. Each world has its own time-based game mechanic: * 2. Time and Forgiveness plays as an ordinary platform game, except that the player may rewind time to undo their actions. The section includes several challenges that would be unplayable or unfair in an ordinary platform game, but become feasible when the rewind mechanic is available. * 3. Time and Mystery introduces objects surrounded by a green glow that are unaffected by time manipulation; for example, switches will remain flipped even if time is rewound to before the action occurred. Rewinding can thus be used to change the synchronization between objects that can and cannot be rewound, the basis of many puzzles in this section. This theme is also used in later worlds to denote objects unaffected by the player's time manipulation. * 4. Time and Place links the passage of time to the player character's location on the horizontal axis. As the player moves toward the right, time flows forward, while moving toward the left reverses the flow; standing still or moving vertically will pause time. The player's location must be carefully managed in relation to enemies and objects. * 5. Time and Decision involves a \\"shadow\\" of the player character appearing after the player rewinds time and performing the actions that the real player character rewound; if the timeline expires, the shadow will complete any initiated falls and jumps but will otherwise stand still before disappearing. Things coloured in violet can interact both with the main character and his shadow at the same time. Puzzles in this section revolve around using this mechanic to carry out multiple actions at once. * 6. Hesitance provides the player with a magic ring which, when dropped, warps the flow of time around itself; the closer moving objects (including Tim) are to it, the slower time passes for them. The regular rewind control remains available. * The final world is labeled simply \\"1.\\" In this world, time flows in reverse. Rewinding time returns the flow of time to its normal state. Each stage contains puzzle pieces that must be collected to create jigsaw puzzles that tell the story, and to unlock the last stage. On completing the main game, a speedrun mode becomes available for select levels and the entire game. There are also eight stars hidden throughout the world of Braid that correspond to the stars in the constellation of Andromeda just outside the main character's house.  Plot  Tim is a man searching for a princess who \\"has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster.\\" His relationship with this princess is vague at best, and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or, if possible, erase. As one progresses through the six worlds in Braid, storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for the princess, and alludes to the overarching gameplay mechanic of each level. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration. The final level, in which everything but Tim moves in reverse, depicts the princess escaping from a knight, and working together with Tim to surpass obstacles and meet at her home. Tim is suddenly locked out of the house, and, as time progresses forward, reversing Tim's actions, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight. Tim is revealed to be the \\"monster\\" the princess is running from. Following completion of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb‚Äî\\"Now we are all sons of bitches\\"‚Äîis that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development. Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braids plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as \\"You must look back to go forwards\\" as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he \\"would not be capable\\" of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is \\"something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly.\\" Blow considered Braid to be \\"about the journey, not the destination\\". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide \\"a longer-term challenge\\".  Development  alt=A young adult male addressing an audience behind a podium. Jonathan Blow created Braid as a game that deconstructed current video games trends, \\"bringing together the abstract parts of a complex puzzle, revealing deep moral and philosophical questions\\". Blow came up with the concept of Braid in December 2004 while on a trip to Thailand, and started development work on it in April the following year. By December 2005, a version of the game was completed that had the same number of worlds and puzzles as the final version, but lacked the final artwork; this version won the Independent Games Festival game design award at the 2006 Game Developer's Conference. While working on the art direction, Blow tightened the presentation and mechanics of the puzzles to improve their playability. During the game's three years of development, Blow put about US$200,000 of his own money into its development, most going towards hiring David Hellman for artwork and for living expenses. Originally, Blow had envisioned the game to be broken into several different worlds as in the final game, each exploring facets of space, time, and causality, but with each world having very different high-level mechanics. One mechanic that he could not develop further was a world with no \\"arrow of time\\" that would have required the player to traverse the level in a manner that could be repeated in reverse. For example, the player would have been forbidden to jump down from a tall height while moving in forward time, as they would not be able to jump that height in reverse time. While this idea was not used, Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects. Another game mechanic that Blow considered was to show the player the expected result of an action they would take; while this concept was informative, he did not find it to be an entertaining game mechanic. Blow had previously explored this in a prototype game called \\"Oracle Billiards\\", the game predicting each billiards shot before it was made. He had found the billiards setting too chaotic for this idea and this led him to try out similar ideas in a simpler \\"Mario-style\\" setting. After selecting the game mechanics he wanted, he began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on his views on game design in general. After brainstorming more puzzles and concepts, Blow dropped the least interesting puzzles and worlds from the game. Blow wanted to include significant consequences of rewinding time, not found in games such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Blinx: the Time Sweeper, and TimeShift in which rewinding time creates few or no changes to the game's world. While these games immerse the player with these time-shifting effects using a first- or third-person perspective, he decided to use a 2D presentation. Blow noted that some of the puzzles in Braid would have been more difficult or impossible to solve in any other perspective. One of Blow's design goals was to achieve gameplay innovation naturally through the artistic expression of the game. He used Rod Humble's The Marriage as an example, in which Humble set out to make a game that related his feelings of being in a marriage, instead of developing game concepts first and adding the story later. As such, Blow noted that while there were no new gameplay mechanics, the gameplay felt different from any other game. Another concept that he used for Braids development related to the game's presentation to the player. Blow recognized that many games present a complex interface to the player that get in the way of understanding the game, but at times are needed to explain the game's rules to draw in players. Blow referenced Jeff Minter's Space Giraffe, pointing out that the game never communicated the purpose of playing the game upfront to the player, citing that as one of the reasons for the game's poor reception. Braid was developed to promote this non-verbal communication to the player, explaining the fundamental rule of each world at its start and allow the player to interact with that rule throughout the world. Commenting during the development of his following game, The Witness, Blow noted that he would run into difficulty in demonstrating Braid through video footage alone, as it would not show \\"what happens in the player's mind during the puzzle-solving process\\", a problem that he had also encountered with The Witness. Blow recognized that the puzzles in Braid had a range of difficulties, with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others, and did not have any set difficulty curve. He designed most of the game's levels to let the player bypass the puzzles, allowing them to experience the rest of the game even if they could not solve a difficult puzzle. Only certain boss fights require the player to defeat the enemy character before continuing on, using a combination of the time mechanics. Blow hoped that players would be able to find solutions to puzzles they had skipped by completing puzzles later in the game. Blow felt that \\"unearned rewards are false and meaningless\\", and thus included collectibles earned only after solving a puzzle. He strongly discouraged players from using a walkthrough to work their way through Braid, instead encouraging players to solve them on their own so that they \\"will feel very good about\\" completing the puzzles without help; Blow created his own official \\"walkthrough\\" that initially appears to guide the player, but then instead restates his insistence that the player work through the puzzles on their own. Some puzzles pay homage to other video games; one level features a Donkey Kong-inspired puzzle, and the ending of most worlds tells the player that \\"the princess is in another castle\\", similar to the end of each world in Super Mario Bros. The game's story was influenced by such works as Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams, Robert A. Heinlein's The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, and David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Specifically, while Blow took the unique narrative model of Invisible Cities, he did not like the homage to it in Einstein's Dreams, and thus avoided taking the story in that direction. Blow's goal was that Braid would \\"be mind-expanding\\" and that \\"people [would] get experiences from it that they [had] not gotten from anything else\\". Blow opted to present his story through on-screen text instead of in-game cutscenes, asserting, against criticism of the lack of such cut- scenes, that Braid was \\"conceived as a videogame with its story presented in the tradition of a few books that I respect\\". = Artwork = The game's artwork took more than a year to complete. Background artwork for the game went through initial rough color concepts created by Mike Corriero (creative illustrator and concept artist) and ultimately the final artwork was created by David Hellman, artist of the critically acclaimed webcomic A Lesson Is Learned but the Damage Is Irreversible. Blow gave Hellman rough images of the level's layout and told him to draw over it. Hellman and Blow iterated through several styles before settling on final versions. Through these changes, the two worked to identify and remove elements of the art that could confuse the player, while retaining aesthetic elements that would be generalized by the player as non-functional parts of the level. Once the game's overall artwork was created, Blow and Hellman broke out functional pieces that could be used in Braids level editor. As each world was built up using these pieces, Blow suggested more changes that reflected the tone of each world and avoided art that distracted from the gameplay. \\"Time and Forgiveness\\", the first world the player encounters, was drawn to create a feel of exploration and forgiveness, while artwork for \\"Time and Decision\\" used a mix of \\"luxurious domestic objects (nice furniture and fabrics) with rugged outdoor objects (swampy water, rotting piers and nautical rope)\\" to create an intentionally \\"incongruous\\" look to convey aspects of alternate realities. Several variations on the game's backgrounds were done until they arrived at the concept of blurring the background elements to make them appear out of focus, while keeping the foreground elements sharply in focus and clear to the player. Particle effects were applied to both background and foreground elements to add apparent motion to them, such as the waving of grass blades or the movement of clouds. The character visuals were originally created by Edmund McMillen, but were later redrawn by Hellman \\"to better match the now- predominant style of the backgrounds\\". = Music = Braid features licensed music from Magnatune artists Cheryl Ann Fulton, Shira Kammen and Jami Sieber. Part of Blow's decision to use licensed music was to reduce development costs. He also felt that those who regularly compose video game music did not have the necessary skills needed to create the mood he wanted for the game. He ultimately selected eight tracks that were sufficiently long to avoid notable looping while a player attempted to solve a difficult puzzle, and that provided a \\"different and interesting\\" sound when played in reverse to match the reverse time mechanic of the gameplay. Blow also selected tracks that were \\"organic and complex\\" as to help set the game's mood and aimed \\"to present something that isn't necessarily clear-cut\\". The selection of the music influenced the creation of the background artwork for the game. Both Kammen and Sieber received favorable feedback from listeners as a result of their works' inclusion in Braid. Magnatune released a soundtrack of the game's music on April 9, 2009, which includes two additional track remixes that incorporate some of the time-shifting elements from the game. The pieces included in Braid are: * \\"Maenam\\" by Jami Sieber, from Hidden Sky * \\"Undercurrent\\" by Jami Sieber, from Lush Mechanique * \\"The Darkening Ground\\" by Jami Sieber, from Lush Mechanique * \\"Tell It by Heart\\" by Jami Sieber, from Second Sight * \\"Long Past Gone\\" by Jami Sieber, from Second Sight * \\"Downstream\\" by Shira Kammen, from Music of Waters (The entire track is actually composed of three pieces of music. The first is \\"Downstream\\" itself, composed by Kammen, the second is \\"O Son do Ar\\", composed by Luar Na Lubre, and the third is Eric Montbel's \\"Borr√®ia d'Aragon\\") * \\"Lullaby Set\\" by Shira Kammen and Swan, from Wild Wood * \\"Romanesca\\" by Cheryl Ann Fulton, from The Once and Future Harp  Release  Prior to release, Blow withdrew Braid from the 2007 Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition in protest after the controversial Super Columbine Massacre RPG! was dropped from the competition despite being one of six finalists. Several other developers followed suit and later withdrew their games, including thatgamecompany's flOw and The Behemoth's Castle Crashers. Braid was originally developed as a Windows title with possible console versions, though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first. Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start-up title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if he was forced to add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level. The Windows version was originally slated for a late 2008 release but slipped to at least October 2008. Blow decided to prevent Braid being overwhelmed by a number of large titles that were scheduled for release in late 2008 and pushed the release to early 2009. The PC version benefited from the work by Blow to create Braid on a standardized platform like the Xbox 360 in order to finish the core game before dealing with various compatibility issues inherent in PC development. Prior to the game's release for Microsoft Windows, Blow had priced the game at , using pricing models for other games such as World of Goo and Crayon Physics Deluxe. However, this was priced $5 more than the Xbox Live version, leading many to criticize his pricing choice. Due to this response, Blow reduced the price to meet the Xbox Live cost, stating that he would \\"rather have people talking about the game itself\\" than complaining about its cost. Hothead Games ported Braid to both the PlayStation 3 and Macintosh platforms. A Linux port was done by Ryan C. Gordon and released in December 2010 as part of the second Humble Indie Bundle alongside the Windows and Mac version. It was further added as a bonus to the Humble Indie Bundle V. Blow said that a WiiWare version would not be possible under Nintendo's current size restrictions. Blow has expressed that he has no current plans to release more levels or make a sequel; however, he specified that \\"if another developer out there really likes the time mechanics and wants to make a game that uses them, and perhaps some new ones, with their own new level designs, then hey, awesome.\\" Shortly after the PC release, Blow released resources for a level editor for Braid that allow users to import new graphics into the game. Since then, several mods containing new puzzles and story content have been released. =Anniversary edition= An anniversary edition was announced in August 2020 for planned release in early 2021 for across Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The updated version will include high-resolution graphics, additional music, and developer commentary. Reception Upon its release to Xbox Live Arcade, Braid received critical acclaim, with an aggregate review score of 93/100 at Metacritic, making it the top-rated Xbox Live Arcade game and the 10th highest-rated Xbox 360 game. Braid was purchased by more than 55,000 people during the first week of release. According to Blow, Braid was the second-largest selling Xbox Live Arcade title in 2008 and sales were \\"very profitable\\", making him more money than if he had been working at a high-paying job for the time it took to develop the game. The game had sold 450,000 copies by April 2012. By 2014, Blow had stated that sales of Braid brought in more than $4 million in revenue, much of which he used towards the development of his 2016 game, The Witness. Braid has been considered a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation and the need to understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if \\"years of gaming blinders have been ripped away.\\" Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were \\"elaborate and formidable\\", but \\"impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve\\", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was \\"the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you to come to terms with its mature tale the next\\". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not \\"feel immature\\" as it \\"expects [as] much\\" of the player as any other form of media and \\"doesn't short you in any respect\\". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork \\"juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments\\", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were \\"eye-catching but never distracting\\". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids \\"beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision\\", and that \\"the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles\\". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to rewind time indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's \\"core challenges\\". The game was primarily criticized for its short length. IGN's Hilary Goldstein stated that the game offers \\"no reason to come back\\" once you've completed all the puzzles. However, others compared Braids short experience to similar criticisms with Portal in that its length \\"can be disregarded in the face of its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas\\". The game's price was also seen as a negative for the game, though McShea wrote that \\"Braid is worth every penny\\". Blow later said that he expected the price to be , but Microsoft, in promoting the game as part of its Summer of Arcade, made the price $15. Edge also noted that while Blow had tried to integrate the story and gameplay throughout the game, this only worked well in the final world, and otherwise the story was \\"a little trite in its self-conscious obscurity\\". However, others ‚Äî including new media academics ‚Äî have disagreed, praising the philosophical complexity of the game, with John Finlay Kerr writing \\"Jonathan Blow's Braid is the sort of ontological labyrinth that Jorge Luis Borges might have made. Embedded in the simple gameplay design are genuinely huge concepts.\\"Kerr, John Finlay (2009) Review: The Pleasures of Computer Gaming, Film-Philosophy, vol. 13, no. 1: pp. 165-175. The PC version of the game was considered to be \\"faithful\\" to the Xbox 360 version of the game, retaining the same content without adding any new features. Reviewers commented that Braid benefited from keyboard controls. However, as a port of the Xbox 360 version, the lack of initial support for optimizing the graphics display for one's computer, either through larger screen resolutions or turning off certain game effects, was seen as a drawback, though it is expected that patches will be released to add these options. Both the PlayStation 3 and Macintosh ports of the game by Hothead Games were found to be easily accessible on the system and retained all the innovation and challenge of the original Xbox Live game. = Awards = In addition to winning the Independent Games Festival award in 2006 during its design, Braid was selected by GameSpot for their 2008 awards in \\"Best Original Downloadable Console Game\\", \\"Best Platformer\\", and \\"Best Licensed Music\\", and by Official Xbox Magazine for their 2008 awards of \\"Xbox Live Arcade Game of the Year\\", \\"Best Soundtrack\\", and \\"Best Ending\\" and one of their \\"Indisputably Incredible Runners-ups to Game of the Year\\". Braid was awarded the \\"Casual Game of the Year\\" at the 12th Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Awards. Braid was nominated for five Xbox Live Arcade 2008 awards, winning one award in the category of \\"Best Innovation\\". MacWorld included Braid in its 2009 Game Hall of Fame. IGN named Braid the 8th best Xbox Live Arcade game in a September 2010 listing, and the 25th best PlayStation 3 game in a September 2013 listing.  Legacy  Developers have cited Braid as an influence on their game design. Japanese video game developer Goichi \\"Suda51\\" Suda, developer of killer7 and No More Heroes, stated that playing Braid made him want to try making a 2D title. Tim can be unlocked as a playable character in Super Meat Boy, a game designed by independent game developer Edmund McMillen who had previously created Gish and the original character designs for Braid. Braid has also garnered academic interest and acclaim for its complexity, with narratologists saying \\"Anyone who thinks... the unique constraints of game play cannot possibly be used to best structure a story has probably not encountered Braid, which marries pure mechanics and story into a philosophical platform.\\" Braids use of narrative elements and puzzle-making has been compared to similar techniques of \\"imperative storytelling\\" in novels such as Life: A User's Manual and Through the Looking-Glass. Braid is considered the definitive title that launched wide interest in independently developed video games starting around 2008 and onward. The Guardian considered the game as the \\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\\" of indie gaming, a potent symbol for the saleable potential of non-mainstream productions\\". Joshuah Bearman for The New York Times called Braid the \\"Easy Rider moment\\", showcasing how a small developer can be as successful as a large one. Indie game studios Playdead, Supergiant Games, and Amanita Design stated that Braid was not unique as it was released on newly-created digital distribution services alongside other successful indie titles like Castle Crashers, World of Goo, and Super Meat Boy. However, they continued, Braids financial success without aid of a publisher showed that small teams could achieve mainstream success, paving the way for many future indie games developed out in a similar manner. Others saw Braids legacy in its art form; Sam Machkovech for Ars Technica compared the game to The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, a transformative work in the genre that used familiar elements in a new manner. Braid, along with Jonathan Blow's insight on the game, was featured in Indie Game: The Movie.

The campaign was fought during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era in the region of Dabieshan (Â§ßÂà´Â±±, literally meaning Great Departure Mountain) and resulted in communist victory. This campaign was part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Central and Southern China. Order of battle Nationalist (17,000 total): *People's Self-Defense Army of the Hubei ‚Äì Henan ‚Äì Anhui Border Region Communist (30,000 total): *71st Division of the 24th Army *126th Division of the 42nd Army *Two garrison brigades of the Northern Anhui Military District *Three regiments of the Henan Military District *Independent 3rd Division of Hubei Military District *Units of Huanggang Military Sub- District Campaign In order to eradicate the 17,000 strong People's Self- Defense Army of the Anhui ‚Äì Hubei ‚Äì Henan Border Region (the nationalist guerrilla consisted of mostly bandits) under the command of Wang Zongxian (Ê±™ÂÆ™Âèä) Fan Xun (Ê®äËøÖ) in the Dabie Mountain, communists deployed over 30,000 troops including 71st Division of the 24th Army, the 126th Division of the 42nd Army, two garrison brigades of the Northern Anhui Military District, three regiments of the Henan Military District, the Independent 3rd Division of Hubei Military District, and units of Huanggang Military Sub-District. A new command was created as the Hubei ‚Äì Henan ‚Äì Anhui Border Region Bandit Eradication Command. The communist second commander-in-chief of Hubei Military District of Central China Military Region, Wang Shusheng (ÁéãÊ†ëÂ£∞) was named as both the commander-in-chief and the political commissar of the newly formed command in August 1949, and he was later to be awarded with rank of Senior General in 1955. On August 10, 1949, the communists made up their strategy in attacking the enemy in three fronts: east, west and south. On September 5, 1949, communists launched their simultaneous attacks on the nationalist guerrilla mostly consisted of bandits and the nationalist stronghold Golden Camp, (Jinzhai, ÈáëÂØ®) county fell into the communist hands on the same day. The bandits attempted to fight a guerrilla war in smaller formations and communists countered by eliminating their adversary's guerilla bases in regions including Liangban (‰∏§Áïà) precinct of Golden Camp, (Jinzhai, ÈáëÂØ®), Green (Èùí) precinct of Shangcheng (ÂïÜÂüé) county, Muzi Shop (Êú®Â≠êÂ∫ó) of Macheng (È∫ªÂüé) county,. Communists in the eastern front attacked regions around Golden Camp, (Jinzhai, ÈáëÂØ®) county and Gushi (Âõ∫Âßã). On September 30, 1949, the nationalist guerrilla headquarter in Hat Top Mountain (Maodingshan Â∏ΩÈ°∂Â±±) 30 km to the south of Golden Camp, (Jinzhai, ÈáëÂØ®) was discovered by a detachment of the communist 71st Division, who immediately attacked and annihilated the nationalist guerrilla consisted of mostly bandits. Soon after, another 1,700 bandits under the command of nationalist commanders Zhang Lianhe (Âº†ËøûÂêà) and Wang Yaonan (Ê±™ËÄÄÂçó) were completely annihilated by the communists. The nationalist commander-in- chief Wang Zongxian (Ê±™ÂÆ™Âèä) and the first deputy commander-in-chief Fan Xun (Ê®äËøÖ) of the local nationalist guerrilla command were both captured alive. In the meantime, communist force at the northern front concentrated attack in the region to the south of Shangcheng (ÂïÜÂüé) county, annihilated more than a thousand local bandits, including their commander, Feng Chunbo (ÂÜØÊò•Ê≥¢). Communist force at the southern front concentrated on the regions including Golden Camp, (Jinzhai, ÈáëÂØ®), Hemp City (Macheng, È∫ªÂüé) county, and Luotian (ÁΩóÁî∞), annihilated over 1,200 bandits under the command of Zhou Xiangbo (Âë®È¶ôÊ≥¢) and Rao Guodong,(È•∂ÂõΩÊ†ã). By the end of November 1949, over 12,000 nationalists had been killed or captured, and nationalist force with strength over 100 troops no longer existed in the region, and the large scale military operation had thus turned into mop up operations of much less scale, with much increased political and propaganda pressure, which lasted until the end of the campaign. Conclusion In March 1953, the Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Dabieshan ended with communist victory. In addition to completely annihilating over 15,400 nationalist guerrilla troops, the communists also succeeded in capturing 81 artillery pieces, 13,883 firearms, and large amount of supplies.

Samuel Young (26 February 1822 ‚Äì 18 April 1918) was an Irish brewer and Protestant nationalist politician. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for East Cavan from 1892 until 1918, becoming the oldest serving member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Born in Dunevelly, near Portaferry in County Down, Young grew up in a Church of Ireland family and attended the Old Presbyterian School in Belfast before becoming a draper, eventually coming to run his own store. In 1872, he went into partnership to open a brewery in Limavady. Among his employees was future Nationalist Party leader Joseph Devlin. Despite his Protestant faith, Young supported the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and the cause of Home Rule. With Devlin's support, he was elected for the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation in East Cavan at the 1892 general election. Already seventy years of age, he won the seat with a majority of nearly six to one over his Unionist opponent. In 1894, he founded the Ulster Liberal Land Committee, while in 1896 he sat on the Royal Commission for Liquor Licensing Laws. Unlike the majority of the Federation, Young held conservative views. He opposed the Gaelic League and in 1900 was criticised by the United Irish League (UIL) for attending a garden party at Buckingham Palace. Although he followed the Federation by joining the merger with the UIL in the re-united Irish Parliamentary Party that year, he was again criticised for attending the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. He defended himself as a \\"loyal subject\\" and called for Ireland under Home Rule to retain the British monarchy and share armed forces with Britain. Young retained his Parliamentary seat, never facing any further opposition at elections,Walker, op. cit, 333 until his death in 1918 at the age of 96. By this time, he had become the oldest ever member of the UK Parliament at Westminster, and the oldest in any of its predecessor Parliaments since Francis Knollys in the sixteenth century.

The film was directed by Tamar Simon Hoffs, and stars Malcolm McDowell and Max Beesley. It was released in 2008.  Plot  Amid a haze of cigarette smoke and uneaten food, the family of Enda Doyle (Malcolm McDowell) gathers in Dublin for his wake. A university librarian, poet, and complicated man, he has left behind a trail of unresolved issues, a dysfunctional family, and a disturbing mystery. Red Roses and Petrol, a darkly comic feature film by director Tamar Simon Hoffs, explores the emotional twists and turns of familial relationships. Enda's dazed widow, Moya (Olivia Tracey), anxiously prepares for the next day's funeral with her still stuck- at-home, twenty-something daughter Medbh (Maeve) (Heather Juergensen), lending a loving hand. Moya's desperation to keep her family together and Medbh's sharp tongue provide the backdrop for the arrival from New York of headstrong older sister Catherine (Susan Lynch), with her handsome but awkward boyfriend Tom (Greg Ellis) in tow. They doubt that London-based Johnny (Max Beesley), the angry black sheep brother of the family, will appear at all. Sorting through boxes of Enda's books, the women discover a cache of self-recorded video diaries that might shed light on who Enda Doyle really was, and some of the secrets of his life that he was never able to share with them. At the funeral, the daughters see a distraught young woman from the university, Helen (Catherine Farrell), rumored to be having an affair with Enda. They're stunned that she would show up so brazenly at a family gathering for the deceased Enda. Returning home, they find Johnny emerging half-naked from the shower, after a quick tryst with a stewardess he met on his flight from London. A brilliant, wounded slacker, Johnny manages to irritate everyone to the edge of violence with his biting and sarcastic recall of the family's long buried memories. Johnny's confrontational behavior and bitter assessment of life with father, incite the clan into what can only be called unchecked family therapy. Throughout the ensuing arguments, which reach a fevered pitch as the family gets inebriated waiting for guests to arrive for the wake, we learn about the powerful and ambiguous force that was Enda Doyle. Finally, Catherine cannot contain herself and accuses Moya of being blind to her husband's infidelity and by extension causing great harm to herself and her children. In a surprising twist, Enda's own videotapes give the family the answers they returned home to find.

Located outside the Orlando city limits, the community is desirable for its proximity to the city's downtown, its location within the Butler chain of lakes, and as a local status symbol of wealth and grandeur. Isleworth traces its roots to the Chase family, a group of citrus grove owners from Philadelphia who purchased land in the area after the U.S. Civil War. Sidney and Joshua Chase referred to their property as the \\"Isle of Worth,\\" because its citrus trees seemed naturally resistant to periodic cold snaps. In 1984, Chase descendants sold their lands to Arnold Palmer, who with developers designed an extra large golf course for wealthy members. In 1993, the Tavistock Group purchased the golf course and surrounding area and began developing the large, expensive and magnificent mansions that are a hallmark of the community. Isleworth is home to a championship 18-hole golf course originally designed by Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay, later re-designed and modified by Steve Smyers. The course consistently ranks as the longest and toughest course in the state by the Florida State Golf Association (FSGA). It complements another Tavistock development on the other side of Orlando, Lake Nona. Late in 2007, the community became a bone of contention between Orange County officials and nearby Windermere when the city announced plans to annex Isleworth. With property tax rolls totaling $800 million that year, it generated $3.5 million in tax revenues for the county that the city was anxious to redirect to its own coffers. Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty quickly threatened to end county fire and sheriff services to Isleworth if annexation plans went forward.\\"Isleworth's tax revenue spurs face-off,\\" by David Damron, Orlando Sentinel, 19 December 2007.

In 1592, he painted an Annunciation, once attributed to Lama, for the church of the Santissimo Corpo di Cristo di Maddaloni. He painted an Adoration of the Magi (1595) for San Pietro ad Aram. In 1598, he painted a Marriage of the Virgin with Lama for Ss. Corpo de Cristo. That same year, he also painted a Enthroned Madonna with San Martino and Santa Fede as well as a St Aniello with Saints Peter and Biagio, now found in Ss. Corpo de Cristo. For the latter church he would later paint a Last Supper, a Christ carrying the Cross, a Maddonna dell'Arco, and a Madonna del Carmine with St Catherine. He painted an altar-piece for the church of San Matteo at Naples, representing the Virgin with the Infant Jesus in clouds surrounded by angels.

Patrick Anderson was the son of James Anderson, an early Scot (c. 1707) immigrant to Pennsylvania and Elizabeth Jerman (Jarman), the daughter of Thomas Jerman, a Welsh Quaker, who purchased one of William Penn‚Äôs first grist milling licenses (History of Tredyffrin Twp, PA ). Patrick was born at ‚ÄúAnderson Place,‚Äù in then Charlestown Township, Pennsylvania now Schuylkill Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He was the first person of European descent born in Charlestown Township. He was educated in Philadelphia and returned home to farm. He built, opened and taught at the first school house in the Valley Forge area. He was married 3 times, the first time to Hannah Martin in historic Christ Church, Philadelphia . Patrick was captain of a company of Chester County men who served in the French and Indian War. At the time of the Revolution, Patrick was serving on Anthony Wayne's first Chester County Committee of Safety. The Assembly sent a Captain's Commission to him, and, although an older man, being 55 at the time, Patrick accepted it, called together his old soldiers, and the entire company of fifty-six men enlisted. His company was known as the Chester County Minute Men of 1775. Patrick paid for and outfitted his entire company but was never compensated by the Continental Congress, and lost half of his farm, which he had mortgaged to a neighbor. In March 1776, he was appointed senior captain of the Pennsylvania Battalion of Musketry (sometimes called Samuel Atlee's Battalion)(Pennsylvania Archives¬ªSeries 5¬ªVolume II¬ªThe Musketry Battalion. Colonel Samuel J. Atlee. March 6, 1776.(a)¬ªPage 467 ) and fought for one tour of the Revolution, until the impairment of his health compelled his retirement. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He fought bravely at the Battle of Long Island, Battle of Fort Washington, the Battle of Brandywine and Battle of Germantown. A letter from Patrick to Benjamin Franklin describing the disarray of the Pennsylvania troops after the Battle of Long Island is preserved in the Pennsylvania State Archives (Penna.

Newsday.com, September 15) was an American ecologist and Professor Emeritus at the Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University, State University of New York. He was one of the leading pioneers of modern ecology. His innovative thinking and research, provocative teaching, and visionary leadership helped transform ecology into a modern science, with deep links to evolution.  Biography  Slobodkin was born in 1928 in the Bronx, son of Louis Slobodkin and Florence (Gersh) Slobodkin. He was strongly influenced by the artistic, intellectual, cultural, and political milieu in which he developed; his mother was a writer and his father a noted sculptor who later became a well-known illustrator and writer who received the distinguished Caldecott Award for his watercolor illustrations of the children's book, Many Moons as well as biographies of the legendary revolutionaries Garibaldi and Lenin. While absorbing the lessons of art and literature, Slobodkin developed a guiding interest in biology, which he pursued first at Bethany College in West Virginia, and later under G. Evelyn Hutchinson at Yale University, where he received his doctorate in 1951 at the age of 23.Futuyma DJ, Colwell RK (2009) Lawrence B. Slobodkin (1928‚Äì2009): Integrating Theory, Models, and Experiments in Ecology. PLoS Biol 7(12). pp.1-2 (licensed under CC BY 2.5) After completing his Ph.D., Slobodkin worked for two years for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, where he developed a novel, theoretically informed hypothesis for the origin of red tides. He then joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in the Department of Zoology in 1953. In 1968 he moved to the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Among his many other activities, Slobodkin held a key post as instructor and director of a marine ecology course, taught at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole for many years in the 1960s, that served as a training ground for prominent ecologists. He was a visiting scholar at Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, and Ben-Gurion University, as well as the Weizmann Institute, in Israel, twice a Guggenheim Fellow, twice a Fulbright Fellow, and a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He was honored by being elected as Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and as Foreign Member of the Linnean Society of London. He was president of the American Society of Naturalists in 1985 and the Society for General Systems Research in 1969. In 2005, Slobodkin, then Emeritus Professor of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University, was named Eminent Ecologist by the Ecological Society of America.ESA Bulletin (2005) Eminent Ecologist Award, Lawrence B. Slobodkin, State University of New York at Stony Brook. Volume 86, Issue 4, October, p. 215  Work  Hutchinson, one of the most renowned ecologists of the 20th century, sought broad theoretical principles for ecology, and with his students helped to build a modern theoretical and mathematical framework on foundations that Volterra and Gause had already laid. Slobodkin played an important role in developing this framework via his research, teaching, and his very influential book, Growth and Regulation of Animal Populations, which served as a blueprint for generations of students of ecology at all levels. His doctoral research, a detailed study of the role of age structure in the growth of experimental populations of the microcrustacean Daphnia, epitomized his approach‚Äîa quantitative experimental test of a mathematical theory that was intended to apply broadly. = University of Michigan = At the University of Michigan Slobodkin pioneered the use of calorimetry as a tool for studying the \\"efficiency\\" of energy flow in ecosystems, a field in which his groundbreaking experimental work left a permanent legacy. He initiated a research program on brown and green hydra that explored such problems as the joint role of food and predation on limiting population growth, and the continuum of species interactions that lie between mutualism and parasitism. Together with Nelson Hairston, Sr. and Frederick Smith, he wrote one of the most influential papers in the history of ecology, a four-page essay in The American NaturalistHairston N. G, Smith F. E, Slobodkin L. B (1960) Community structure, population control, and competition. The American Naturalist 879: 421‚Äì425. that is still required reading for many students in this field. Submitted under the title \\"√âtude\\" (unacceptable to the editors), HSS (as the paper is often referred to, for Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin) offered a simple but closely reasoned hypothesis for the regulation of populations at each trophic level in terrestrial ecosystems. The \\"world is green\\", they reasoned, despite the insatiable appetite and enormous diversity of herbivores, because herbivore populations are held in check by their own natural enemies‚Äîpredators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens. This hypothesis was both controversial and inspiring, and stimulated much later research on tri-trophic interactions, food web dynamics, and trophic cascades. Larry Slobodkin enthusiastically shared his personal vision of science as a form of art. Thus, he asked a class of undergraduate students to look closely at the mounted skeleton of a cat he brought into the room with him - but to first look at it as an example of visual flow like a statue and only then as an example of adaptation. His quick and sophisticated wit, infusing both his conversation and teaching, was legendary. During a lecture at the University of Michigan, held in a basement-level auditorium where the podium was flanked by a door to the building's loading dock, he described the musical genius that blessed successive generations of the Bach family to illustrate principles of heredity. At that moment, a great clattering of garbage cans issued from the loading area. The noise had hardly stopped when Slobodkin quipped, ‚Äúthe janitors here prefer Tchaikovsky‚Äù. = State University of New York at Stony Brook = By the time he moved to the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1968, Slobodkin was one of the most distinguished ecologists in the world. The department he established there - the Department of Ecology and Evolution - was one of the first of its kind, and soon became recognized as a preeminent department in its field under his leadership. While at Stony Brook, Slobodkin served as department chair for five years and directed its graduate program for seven years, in addition to serving as co-editor of The American Naturalist, and writing two more books, most recently A Citizen's Guide to Ecology. Many of the Ph.D. students he mentored first at the University of Michigan and later at Stony Brook went on to become well known ecologists, environmental scientists, and evolutionary biologists. = Research accomplishments = Slobodkin's research accomplishments were broad. He was an innovative thinker whose ideas provided the foundations for many topics that are still studied today. His research and writings were infused with erudition and wit that extended to his lectures and conversations. No one who knew him will forget his ability to express an idea, explanation, or his own experiences in the most incisive and humorous way. His ability to recall poetry, biblical references, arcane historical anecdotes, or Jewish jokes to fit any situation was legendary. He was vocally liberal and sensitive to the needs and feelings of immigrants and others who he thought might feel marginalized. When asked to write a piece for the Ecological Society of America's series, What Do Ecologists Do?, after receiving the award, Slobodkin wrote, \\"My own advice on career development is that there are three career paths open and it is wise to excel at one of them: the first is to become an expert on some group of organisms that excites you‚Ä¶. Second, you [could] become very good at the most popular current techniques at the highest technical level you can imagine. In contrast, you can take the third, and most dangerous, path. You can strenuously avoid doing what everyone else is doing and search for new ideas and new tests for old ideas.\\" Larry Slobodkin followed, with intensity, that third and most perilous path.

The championship debuted on October 14, 2007 at the Bound for Glory pay-per-view (PPV) event under the name the TNA Women's World Championship; it was renamed the TNA Women's Knockout Championship in 2008 through 2010, then simplified to TNA Knockouts Championship until the promotion changed its name in March 2017. It is currently the only female championship in Impact Wrestling. It had been complemented by the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, which was introduced at the No Surrender PPV event on September 20, 2009, but was deactivated on June 27, 2013. At Slammiversary XV, the championship was unified with the GFW Women's Championship. There have been 54 reigns shared between 23 wrestlers. The first champion was Gail Kim. History =TNA Knockout= TNA Knockout, or just Knockout for short, is the term used by TNA to refer to its onscreen female performers; this is similar to TNA's main rival World Wrestling Entertainment and their Divas pseudonym. TNA's first women's accomplishment was announced at TNA's first weekly pay-per-view event on June 19, 2002. It was called the \\"Miss TNA\\" crown. The holder of the crown was determined in a lingerie battle royal on June 19, 2002, which aired on June 26, 2002. The participants in the match were Alexis Laree, Elektra, Erin Bray, Francine, Miss Joni, Sasha, Shannon, Taylor Vaughn, and Teresa Tyler. Vaughn last eliminated Elektra to win the crown. The TNA Knockout of the Year is another award in TNA given to the knockout who achieved the most or had the best run that year. The most recent Knockout of the Year was Gail Kim in 2007; no award has been given out since. On the August 20, 2009 episode of TNA Impact!, backstage interviewer Lauren announced that TNA were planning to host an eight-team single elimination tag team tournament to crown the first-ever TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. The tournament began on the following Impact! and continued on for four weeks, concluding on September 20 at TNA's No Surrender PPV event. There, the team of Sarita and Taylor Wilde defeated The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky) to become the first champions. Two DVDs on the topic of the TNA Knockouts have been released by TNA. The first was named \\"Knockouts: The Ladies of TNA Wrestling Vol.1\\" and was released on August 29, 2006. \\"Knocked Out: The Women of TNA Wrestling\\" was the second, released on October 7, 2008. =Creation= TNA first announced in early September 2007 through their TNA Mobile service that they planned to start an official women's division and debut a women's title soon. Later that month, TNA began to promote a 10 knockout gauntlet match to be held on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event to crown the first-ever TNA Women's Champion. At the event, Gail Kim defeated Ms. Brooks, Christy Hemme, Awesome Kong, Roxxi Laveaux, Talia Madison, Shelly Martinez, Jackie Moore, ODB, and Angel Williams to become the first champion. The championship was renamed in 2008 to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship until 2010 when it became simply known as the TNA Knockouts Championship. =Belt designs= During the championship's history, the belt has had four designs. Its first design featured a white leather strap that is covered with two small gold plates that are encrusted with silver. In the center of each plate stands a figure resembling a globe made out of gold. On the outer edge of the plate are red gems, which circle the entire plate. The center golden plate of the belt has TNA's official logo engraved in the very center with the word above it and the word \\"Champion\\" below it. At the very top of the center plate is a queen's crown. The word \\"Knockout\\" does not appear anywhere on the belt. At the end of December 2014, TNA uploaded a photo on their Instagram account, in which the Knockouts Championship has a new design, replacing the white strap with a black strap, with the red color scheme changed to blue to coincide with the company's color scheme and the plates are now fully gold thus the encrusted silver is removed. As with the previous belt, the word \\"Knockout\\" does not appear on the belt, despite its current name. After Slammiversary XV, the Impact Knockouts Championship and the GFW Women's Championship were carried together, with the unified championship representing the lineage of the Impact Knockouts Championship. At Destination X 2017, a recoloured version of the former GFW Women's Championship was created to represent the championship.

The book was written by Douglas Niles, and published by TSR, Inc. in 1986. Contents The Dungeoneer's Survival Guide describes how to run underground adventures in great detail and includes special rules for movement, combat, mining, and skill proficiencies. The book contains a Dungeon Master's section that covers the underground environment and ecology, as well as the cultures of underground creatures. It includes information on how to make three-dimensional maps, and describes a campaign zone called \\"Deepearth\\". The book includes special game rules for underground activities, combat, travel, and mining, in addition to descriptions of the Underdark and the ecology and cultures of its underground inhabitants, as well as a set of Battlesystem rules for mass-combat in underground settings. The Dungeoneer's Survival Guide includes new proficiencies, as well as ideas for the creation of underground adventures. Characters gain proficiencies by way of \\"non-weapon proficiency slots\\", which can be filled with a variety of secondary skills. This book also provides rules on actions such as how well non-thieves climb walls and trees, how far characters can leap across chasms, and how long characters can hold their breath underwater. The book describes the types of caverns, how player characters may find and enter them, and what may be found there along with the effects of natural hazards, such as cave-ins, floods, underground streams, poisonous gases, volcanoes and lack of oxygen. The book covers the history and relationships of the underground races, and provides advice on how to run interesting underground campaigns. Publication history Dungeoneer's Survival Guide was written by Douglas Niles, with cover art by Jeff Easley, and was published by TSR in 1986 as a 128-page hardcover. It also features interior illustrations by Doug Chaffee, Greg Harper, Jim Roslof, and Jeff Easley.

Bambra noted that while the book covers the Underdark in detail, it is also a major expansion of the AD&D; rules. He felt that the new proficiencies \\"add a whole new dimension to 'AD&D;' gaming\\", as PCs \\"can now do more than just fight and cast spells\\". He also noted that, with proficiencies, characters \\"are able to make armour and weapons, train animals, cut gems, fight effectively in the dark, climb mountains, swim, and perform many other activities that were simply impossible before ... A skill system is something 'AD&D;' has been lacking for a long time, and it is good to see that this one ... fits smoothly and easily into the game.\\" Bambra praised author Doug Niles for creating a sourcebook that \\"proves that underground adventures can be a lot more than simply killing the monster and grabbing its treasure ... the underground has been transformed from a bleak and dirty dungeon to an exciting and intriguing underground fairyland\\". He adds that the suggestions on how to run underground campaigns form one of the best discussions on designing adventures, finding it relevant for any campaign, even those belonging to other game systems. Bambra concludes the review by stating \\"Dungeoneer's Survival Guide is an excellent product which opens many new and exciting opportunities to adventurers everywhere. Don't be put off by the title - 'DSG' contains plenty for ... even the most adamant of wilderness adventurers.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #34 (Aug 1986) Further reading *\\"Sage Advice\\", Dragon #118.

The company was founded by 3 friends, Jack Ward, John Kelland-Knight and Ian Howie in 1946. They each put up ¬£100 to turn Jack's wine making hobby into a business. The Merrydown enterprise, named after Jack's house, was underway. The very first batch of Merrydown Apple Wine was fermented from 450 gallons of apple juice using a 300-year-old oak cider press borrowed from a local farmer and within a year the scale of production had outgrown Mr Ward's garage at his home in Rotherfield and the partners bought Horam Manor nine years later, with seven acres of land. By 1955, production had risen to 400,000 gallons. During the 1980s the cider was sold in 1 litre bottles as either dry (silver label) or sweet (gold label) and had an ABV of 8.2%. However, during the late 1990s the strength was reduced to 7.5% due to potential excess duty costs. The cider (along with the brewery) was acquired by The SHS Group in 2005.BBC NewsStevenson, RachelDecision News Media SAS The SHS Group is a privately owned ¬£400m food and drink company, based in Belfast, who also market Shloer, bottlegreen and WKD. In 2004, Merrydown decided to close its factory and contract out production to other cider manufacturers. Merrydown is available in 750ml glass bottles as well as 440ml cans and 500ml bottles. All Merrydown is still made to the original recipe first developed by the founders back in 1946 and uses eating and culinary apples which gives it a unique appley taste. All Merrydown cider is free from artificial flavourings and sweeteners and is suitable for vegetarians and vegans and is gluten-free. Instead of using cider yeast, yeast from the champagne-ardennes region is used which is why it is slightly sparkling.

Elihu Root Elihu Root was born and grew up in the immediate vicinity of this house, which became his home as an adult. He graduated from Hamilton College and the New York University School of Law. He served as both United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention. President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of War in 1899 and he continued in this capacity under Theodore Roosevelt. Root made many changes to the structure of the American Army, including the establishment of the U.S. Army War College and creation of the General Staff. Root was Secretary of State from 1905‚Äì1909. He was instrumental in improving relations with Japan and with Latin America during this time. Root also was an advocate of the World Court. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, in 1912. After leaving the cabinet, Root was a United States Senator from New York. He was a bitter critic of Woodrow Wilson. History View of east (left) side of houseView of east portico The Elihu Root House was also known as the Grant House due to the marriage between Root's daughter, Edith, and Ulysses S. Grant III. The Grants lived in the house after Root's death. The main part of the Federal style house was built in 1817 as a home for a Hamilton College professor. By the time Elihu Root purchased the house in 1893, there had been many additions and modifications to the structure. A long dormitory had been added during the house's stint as a college boardinghouse. Victorian porches and a staircase were added. The wing to the east was increased from one story to two. After Mr. Root acquired the house, he replaced the Victorian porches with ones more suited to the house. He also had built the portico on the east side of the house and servants quarters at the rear of the building. Mr. Root considered the house his home until his death in 1937. It was listed to the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972, at which time it was still owned by Root's descendants. and The Elihu Root House is located on the campus of Hamilton College, an institution with which Root was affiliated throughout his life.

The two-digit display can be seen on the right. SupraFAXmodem 144 LC modem (1996) Sticker on bottom of SupraFAXmodem 144 LC modem The SupraFAXModem 14400 was a v.32bis modem. When it was Launched by Supra, Inc. in January 1992 at a $399 price point,Difference sources list the price between $349 and $399 the 14,400 bit/s model was less expensive than most existing 9600 bit/s models. This price/performance ratio made it a disruptive technology, and its introduction drove modem prices sharply downward. Whereas a 9600 bit/s modem was perhaps $599 only a month before its introduction; by the end of the year $250 14400 bit/s modems were not uncommon. Background Supra had been a small player in the computer market through the mid-to-late 1980s, known originally for their external hard drives for the Atari ST and a variety of follow-on products. During 1991, Rockwell International's chip-making arm developed a new modem driver chipset that included all of the latest standards that were then under development. Supra, never having been known as a \\"player\\" in the modem world, designed a modem based on the new chipset, and arranged a short-term exclusivity agreement. Design Not content with simply being the first consumer v.32bis modem on the market, Supra made a number of improvements over existing designs. One was the use of a much smaller case, about half the size of most models. The size and shape of modems had initially been set by the original Hayes Smartmodem in 1981, and its case design was widely used a decade later in spite of the internals having shrunk in size considerably over the years. The Supra's smaller design made it much easier to fit on a desk. Additionally, Supra replaced many indicator lights with a two-digit green electroluminescent display that showed the speed of connection and other information such as \\"RI\\" for ring indication and \\"CD\\" for carrier detect. Later models such as the LC (\\"Low Cost\\") used individual lamps that were a common feature of external modems. Software In addition to the basic modem, Supra also introduced software to make better use of all the features of the modem. In particular, Supra re-packaged FAXstf as FAXCilitate, a Macintosh fax application that allowed any application that supported printing to send the output as a fax instead. They later introduced Supra VoiceMail, another Mac application written by STF Technologies that turned the computer into a digital answering machine with caller id routing and similar features. Problems The SupraFAXModem was by no means a perfect product. Continued high-speed use caused the driver chipset to heat up, and as the case lacked any airflow, the modems would eventually get hot enough to lose the ability to connect and start dropping calls. Another minor issue was that the status display codes in the alphanumeric display rotated through several different indications, and important information like CD would only be displayed every few seconds. Both of these issues make them unsuitable for \\"host side\\" use on a bulletin board system or Internet service provider, but on the client end these issues were simply not important. Other models Supra also released a v.32 version at the same time, but it seems to have been fairly uncommon if it was ever really available. Mentions of it disappear by late 1992. The 144LC was a low-cost version that lacked the alphanumeric display and replaced it with conventional LED indicator lamps. They followed up the 14400's with the SupraFAXModem 288, the first consumer v.34 modem, and then a series of various versions with different features. The SupraExpress was a low-cost series that scaled to lower price points, housed in an all-plastic case and lacking most of the indicator lights.

It follows Logan, a lonely 14-year-old boy who adopts a dog from an animal shelter and names her Jack. The pair's relationship is soon threatened by an incurable prion disease spreading across the nation. Infected dogs become unnaturally violent and bloodthirsty, culminating in the deaths of several people. As public fear heightens and the government intervenes to control the outbreak, Logan struggles to reform his life and remain with Jack. The Last Dog on Earth largely focuses on the impact of disease and both public and governmental panic. Society is ravaged by fear over the epidemic, endangering Logan and Jack despite the two being uninfected. Additionally, the novel presents a coming of age story in which Logan, a troubled youth, matures through his relationship with Jack, his only friend. Despite 17th Street Productions holding the rights to The Last Dog on Earth, Dell Publishing gained permission to publish it. The company released the novel in hardcover in 2003 and in paperback in 2004. Throughout 2009, the book was published on various e-book readers, including the Nook, Kindle, and several Apple Inc. products. The Last Dog on Earth was a winner of the Texas Lone Star Reading List and recognized by YALSA on a 2006 book list for young adults. The novel garnered mixed feedback from critics, who generally felt that the plot held appeal, but that Ehrenhaft tended to rely on coincidence. Plot Logan Moore is a troubled 14-year-old boy living with his mother Marianne and stepfather Robert in Newburg, Oregon. Logan does not get along well with Robert or his mother, and holds a grudge against his biological father for leaving when he was young. After an incident at a barbecue, Robert decides to purchase a Labrador Retriever in order to teach Logan responsibility. Eager to rebel against his stepfather, Logan convinces his mother to adopt a dog from an animal shelter. He plans to choose an ugly dog and teach it destructive behavior. At the shelter, Logan encounters a young female mutt who immediately takes a liking to him. Logan adopts the dog and names her Jack after Robert's former dog. Meanwhile, a new prion disease named Psychotic Outburst Syndrome (or POS) is affecting dogs, causing friendly pets to become violent. Officials struggle to control the disease and immediately terminate any dogs that catch it. Humans soon begin to contract the disease. Logan quickly bonds with Jack and values her as his only friend. After getting into trouble while attempting to protect her, Logan is sent to boot camp while Jack remains at home. Both he and Jack manage to escape, find each other, and begin traveling together. During their journey, they encounter another dog called White Paws: Jack's brother who has become infected with POS. White Paws attacks Jack and severely wounds her before dying. Logan worries that Jack may have contracted the disease through contact with White Paws. The pair continue their journey until they reach the town of Dayville. Logan faintly remembers that his biological father lives in the town and decides to find his father and confront him. While Logan is stealing food from a local shop, Jack is found by three men who, fearing that she may be infected, beat her. Logan is arrested and manages to find his father's address at the police station before escaping. He returns to find Jack nearly dead and carries her, attempting to find his father's house, until he faints from exhaustion. He awakens in the house of his biological father, Dr. Craig Westerly, who had found Logan unconscious by his car. Logan learns from Craig that he had not abandoned him and his mother, but that Marianne had divorced him. Logan fears for Jack's life, afraid that she is infected or will be euthanized. Craig runs tests on the dog and learns that Jack, despite having been in contact with POS, isn't infected: she is immune. Craig decides to take Jack to a doctor so that a vaccine can be created. During the meeting, Rudy Stagg, a man infected with POS who had been killing dogs in order to contain the outbreak, stumbles into their room. Rudy ignores pleas to spare Jack and shoots at her, but Logan dives in front of the dog and is shot instead. Logan suffers a collapsed lung and falls into a coma. He awakens weeks later and learns that Jack is on life support. He says a final goodbye to Jack before her life support is turned off. Jack's immunity to POS leads to the creation of a vaccine and cure, and Logan is finally able to reconcile with Robert, Craig, and Devon Wallace--a childhood enemy whose dog died due to POS. The novel's epilogue, written as a newspaper article, reveals Logan and his family hold a private ceremony to honor Jack. Themes and style Ehrenhaft deals with several themes over the course of The Last Dog on Earth. Kirkus Reviews commented on the \\"backdrop of rising governmental and public panic\\" that interfere with Jack and Logan; despite escaping the disease, they are unable to escape the panic. Rachel Seftel, author of a Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy review, also commented on the \\"mass hysteria\\" that arose due to POS and noted the novel's core theme of a troubled youth being taught \\"valuable lessons until an external force threatens to tear them apart.\\" In order to track particular events and plot points related to POS, Ehrenhaft inserts various messages, faxes, and articles throughout the novel. Publication history 17th Street Productions, a branch of Alloy Entertainment, holds the rights to The Last Dog on Earth. Dell Publishing (a division of the larger publisher Random House) made arrangements with 17th Street to have it released under their name. On February 11, 2003, the novel was released in hardcover, and was later reprinted in paperback under Dell's Yearling book imprint on June 8, 2004. In January 2009, the novel received a Barnes & Noble Nook release in the United States, enabling it to be read on the Nook e-book readers. The listed file size of The Last Dog on Earth is 2224 KB for the brand. On January 21, 2009, the book was released for the Kindle, Amazon.com's online e-book reader. Its listed file size is 448 KB. On February 3, 2010, The Last Dog on Earth was released on Apple Inc.'s iTunes. It is listed as being compatible with the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Later, on February 25, 2009, the novel was released digitally with EPUB and mobile- specific file types for the Borders Group e-book app. Reception and influence The Last Dog on Earth has been nominated for several awards. The novel was recognized and listed on the Texas Library Association's 2004‚Äì2005 Texas Lone Star Reading List. The book was also a nominee for the 2005 Mark Twain Award and 2007 Minnesota Young Reader Award. The Last Dog on Earth was named on \\"Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults 2006\\", a list created by YALSA (Young Adult Library Services Association), a division of the American Library Association. The list is conceived by a committee and compiles various novels that hold appeal to teen readers. The Last Dog on Earth was included in the \\"What Ails You?\\" category, comprising literature \\"about how diseases, disorders, and other general health related symptoms affect our lives\\". In a 2005 interview, Daniel Ehrenhaft mentioned that a school in Chicago created an extracurricular activity wherein \\"kids designed games and gadgets\\", having been inspired by Logan's hobby of inventing devices. The Last Dog on Earth has received mixed reception from critics, who have praised the plot, but criticized the heavy use of coincidences to advance the plot. Kirkus Reviews commented that \\"happenstance plays a large role in the plot\\" and thought Ehrenhaft had \\"a tendency to trot in typecast characters, then summarily drop them\\", but wrote that it would appeal to \\"disaster-tale fans with a taste for the lurid\\". Within the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, Volume 47, Rachel Seftel reviewed the novel. She felt that The Last Dog on Earth's main strength was the \\"well-developed and sympathetic protagonist\\" Logan, but noted that the \\"memos and several subplots\\" interspersed between chapters and Ehrenhaft's \\"[somewhat] heavy-handed\\" attempts to foreshadow were drawbacks. Seftel concluded that, despite Ehrenhaft's \\"reach at times [exceeding] his grasp,\\" The Last Dog on Earth was \\"an interesting and absorbing variation\\" of the slightly conventional \\"boy-and-his-dog story.\\" See also *Countdown novel series *Drawing a Blank References External links *Daniel Ehrenhaft's website *Alloy Entertainment *Random House 2003 American novels Novels about dogs American children's novels American thriller novels American young adult novels Novels set in Oregon Children's novels about animals 2003 children's books ","title":"The Last Dog on Earth"},{"id":"13238918","text":"Cerro Toco is a stratovolcano located in the eastern part of the Atacama desert in Chile's II Region (Antofagasta), approximately south of the border between Bolivia and Chile and SE of the Juriques and Licancabur volcanoes.

Previous seasons = 2000 = Balmain coach Wayne Pearce was the initial coach of the Wests Tigers and new recruit Jarrod McCracken was named captain. A large crowd attended the first trial match played by the team. Before the first round the Tigers were controversially denied a place in the double header at Stadium Australia. It was rumoured that the NRL did not believe the side would be competitive against their opening round opponents and competition heavyweights Brisbane. The debut match for the side was therefore held at Campelltown where after leading 18-6 the side snatched a 24-all draw after falling behind late. The Tigers surprised many by maintaining a high place on the ladder for most of the year (often in second place). Heartbreaking losses to Penrith (after leading 31-8) and in the snow against Canberra combined with injuries to key players saw the Tigers slide out of the 8. The loss of inspirational captain Jarrod McCracken from a spear tackle against Melbourne was a crucial blow. = 2001 = 2002 was a bitter year for the joint venture club, including off- field incidents. After Wayne Pearce announced he would no longer coach the team, Terry Lamb was appointed to the position. This was a controversial selection because of animosity from Balmain supporters due to an incident involving Ellery Hanley in the 1988 Grand Final (see Terry Lamb entry for more information). Early in the season key players Craig Field and Kevin McGuinness tested positive to cocaine and received long suspensions. Field was the team's halfback and playmaker whilst McGuinness was a leading try scorer for the club. Later in the season another big name player was suspended: John Hopoate earned worldwide notoriety when he was charged with inserting his finger into the anus (pushing the players' shorts) of opposition players. Hopoate quit the club and received a long suspension. Lamb was criticised for seeming to condone the activity. = 2002 = During the season the club announced Terry Lamb would not have his contract renewed. The side struggled near the foot of the ladder and only a large victory over Souths moved them clear of the wooden spoon position. The coaching job for 2003 was offered to (and rejected by) both Craig Bellamy and Ian Millward before Tim Sheens was selected. The selection was by no means seen as a positive move by the media as Sheens most recent coaching stint had seen him sacked by the North Queensland Cowboys. = 2003 = The 2003 season was notable for the emergence of new young players through the team as the club moved away from the era of big names and big money signings and focused on developing junior talent. Most notably Benji Marshall, then a schoolboy prodigy with no senior league experience, made his debut against the Newcastle Knights. = 2004 = The Tigers improved greatly in 2004 aided by astute signings of players such as Brett Hodgson and Pat Richards who began to blend well with the younger players emerging as talents. The Tigers narrowly missed the playoffs after losing their final three games when a single victory would have guaranteed finals football for the first time. Key injuries to play makers played a large part as did a long list of errors and tough calls by officials during the year. = 2005 = 2005 was the Wests Tigers best season yet, as they not only made it to the finals for the first time, but also reached the top four in the round robin part of the competition, setting crowd attendance records at three different grounds: Campbelltown Stadium (20,527), Telstra Stadium (29,542) and Leichhardt Oval (22,877). After a slow start, bookmakers rated the Tigers a 150-1 chance to win the premiership. However the club emerged from the bottom half of the table to win a club record 8 in a row before finishing 4th. The team developed a reputation as a flamboyant attacking side who played at a rapid pace to compensate a lack of forward size. The Tigers played their first ever final as a joint venture club at Telstra Stadium against North Queensland. Backed by a passionate crowd the team won 50‚Äì6. They then beat the Brisbane Broncos 34-6 and premiership favourites St George Illawarra Dragons 20‚Äì12 to book a spot against the North Queensland Cowboys. 2005 Grand Final Based on their winning form (they had won 11 of their last 13) and their big win over the Cowboys in the opening finals game, the Wests Tigers were rated favourites to win the 2005 grand final. After a slow start, Bryce Gibbs and Pat Richards scored tries to give the Tigers a 12‚Äì6 lead. The Richards try has been called one of the all-time great Grand Final tries. The try was started by five- eighth Benji Marshall, who received the ball from Brett Hodgson 98 metres from the opposition tryline. He beat Cowboys five-eighth Johnathan Thurston and Matt Sing. He then ran 60 metres, only to be caught by Cowboys fullback Matt Bowen. He made a flick pass to Pat Richards, who then fended off Rod Jensen to score. In the 2nd half the Tigers gained control with tries to Anthony Laffranchi and Daniel Fitzhenry. After withstanding a Cowboys fightback, a Todd Payten try on full-time sealed a 30‚Äì16 win. Captain Scott Prince was then awarded the Clive Churchill medal for 2005. Prince joins football great Peter Sterling who was the original recipient of the medal. Ben Galea, John Skandalis, Benji Marshall among others starred for the Tigers. The premiership victory meant that the club joined an exclusive group that won premierships in their first finals appearance, which had not been achieved in almost 100 years. The group also includes Souths in 1908 and Newtown in 1910. = 2006 = Following the premiership win several key players left the club. From the grand final team, Mark O'Neill, and Pat Richards signed with English clubs. New signings included Jamaal Lolesi (Bulldogs), Keith Galloway (Cronulla Sharks) and Ryan O'Hara (Canberra Raiders). As defending premiers, the Tigers began the season by travelling to England to play ESL champions the Bradford Bulls. Missing many of their star players the Tigers tried hard but were eventually beaten 10‚Äì30. After a come from behind win over competition heavyweights St George-Illawarra, the team struggled with injuries to key players. Most notably Benji Marshall and Brett Hodgson missed large portions of the season. The team suffered a number of narrow losses late in games and also two golden point (extra time) matches in controversial circumstances. The Tigers narrowly missed the finals and the chance to defend their title. One highlight of the season was the debut of several players including Chris Lawrence and the emergence of up and coming players such as Dean Collis. Brett Hodgson played for the NSW State of Origin team in all three games. = 2013 - The Worst Year for the Tigers = In 2013, the Wests Tigers had a horror season and finished on the ladder in 15th and did not qualify for the finals.

Juran and released by Columbia Pictures. Starring Janette Scott and Ronald Lewis, the film is set in the time of King Arthur but as with many Arthurian themed films, the sets and style are from medieval England. The plot is also heavily influenced by Robin Hood. Plot King Arthur learns one of his knights is plotting to take over and marry his daughter. Soon the soldiers of double-dealing Edmund of Cornwall slay the king. However his daughter Katherine escapes with the help of outlaw Robert Marshall. Claiming she is dead Edmund makes ready to usurp the throne in league with Saxon invaders. After coming close to death more than once at the hands of the sinister limping man, Katherine and Robert and other loyal countrymen rescue the great wizard Merlin from the hands of Edmund's men to help them save Camelot and England. They arrive at Camelot just as Edmund is about to be crowned. On Merlin's advice, Robert challenges Edmund to kill him as a traitor using Arthur's sword Excalibur. Edmund is unable to draw the sword from the scabbard, whereupon Robert presents the sword to Katherine, the rightful heir, who draws it out easily. Katherine is recognised by the court as the new Queen, and following a battle against Edmund's remaining men and the invading force of Saxons, Katherine's armies prevail and she offers the lands of Edmund and other renegades to Robert so that he can rule alongside her as King. Cast * Janette Scott as Katherine * Ronald Lewis as Robert Marshall * Ronald Howard as Edmund of Cornwall * Mark Dignam as King Arthur * John Laurie as Merlin * Jerome Willis as the Limping Man * Charles Lloyd-Pack as the Doctor * Francis de Wolff as the Blacksmith Production Producer Charles Schneer made it after a series of fantasies with Ray Harryhausen. This and East of Sudan were made over 15 days using stock footage. \\"Columbia had a lot of unused footage in their library,\\" said the producer. \\"If 10 percent or less of a film made in the United Kingdom was stock footage, you received a government subsidy. I decided that would be a good commercial opportunity, so I made both pictures that way. I took the big action sequences out of Columbia's library.\\" Siege of the Saxons used The Black Knight and East of Sudan used footage from Beyond Mombassa. It was the first of three consecutive films director Nathan Juran made for producer Charles Schnee in England. Shooting was conducted around the Home Counties in England and at Bray Studios in Berkshire. Oakley Court near Windsor, Berkshire was used for the castle interiors, Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire was the forest, and the final battle scenes were shot at Callow Hill, Virginia Water, in Surrey. The film reused a lot of costumes, props, and footage from the earlier and bigger- budgeted 1954 Columbia film, The Black Knight, starring Alan Ladd and costumes and props from the 1963 film Lancelot and Guinevere directed by and starring Cornel Wilde. The hero dons Alan Ladd's armor from The Black Knight. King Arthur wears the same costume as Brian Aherne did as Arthur in Lancelot and Guinevere and even looks much the same as Aherne. The film also uses sequences from some of Columbia's Robin Hood films. Release The film was released on a double bill with Schneer's Jason of the Argonauts (1963), a film best remembered for its Ray Harryhausen special effects. Schneer later hired Juran to direct another pair of films for a similar double bill: a large budget fantasy with special effects by Harryhausen, The First Men in the Moon, and a lower-budgeted English adventure heavily reliant on stock footage, East of Sudan.

The vehicle was found abandoned on a roadside in Italy with terminal engine problems. The main gun had been removed, and a boom & winch assembly had been fitted to the turret. No other Tiger tanks modified in this manner were ever recovered. Naming At the time the vehicle was found it was assumed the vehicle was intended as a tank recovery vehicle. Germans used the \\"berge\\" prefix to denote recovery vehicle versions of tanks, such as the \\"Bergepanther\\" and \\"Bergepanzer\\". Thus the allies dubbed the vehicle they had found the \\"Bergetiger\\". No official German name for this vehicle has ever been located. Dispute Over Bergetiger's Purpose The Bergetiger's role as a recovery vehicle has been disputed ever since its discovery. The evidence often cited against it being a recovery vehicle is that its crane was not designed to tow the weight of a tank, nor was it equipped with any other common recovery equipment. A popular alternate theory is that the vehicle was field-modified (possibly after suffering damage to the main gun) as either a mine-clearing vehicle, or to drop explosives to clear battlefield obstacles.

In 1968, the family moved back to New York when his father took a position at the United Nations. From 1971‚Äì73, they lived in France, where El-Erian's father was the Egyptian Ambassador to France.

The campaign was part of the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era fought in northeastern Guizhou, and resulted in communist victory. This campaign is a major part of Campaign to Suppress Bandits in Southwestern China during the Chinese Civil War in the post-World War II era.

Five counties in northeastern Guizhou including Daozhen (ÈÅìÁúü), Zheng'An (Ê≠£ÂÆâ), Wuchuan (Â©∫Â∑ù), Yanhe (Ê≤øÊ≤≥), and Dejiang (Âæ∑Ê±ü) were controlled by the nationalist guerrilla the communists decided to eliminate these threats. In September 1950, communists gathered enough troops from various detachments and formed the Bandit Eradication Command, and the deputy commander-in-chief of the communist Eastern Sichuan Military District, Zen Shaoshan (ÊõæÁªçÂ±±) was put in charge of the new command. The first stage of the campaign begun on September 22, 1950 when 20 communist battalions totaling around 13,000 begun their simultaneous attacks on the following four counties: Daozhen (ÈÅìÁúü), Zheng'An (Ê≠£ÂÆâ), Wuchuan (Â©∫Â∑ù), and Yanhe (Ê≤øÊ≤≥), all of which fell into communist hands immediately. By the beginning of October, 1950, the organized resistance of bandits have mostly ceased. Communists strengthened their political pressure and most bandits were forced to surrender. In the period of fifty ‚Äì days, over 28,000 bandits were annihilated, including over 22,000 surrendered and defected to the communists. The second stage of the campaign begun on November 18, 1950 and a total of ten communist battalions concentrated their efforts in the Fanjing (Ê¢µÂáÄ) Mountain region where surviving bandits had fled to. After eleven days of fighting, over 4,100 bandits were annihilated, with major bandit chief either captured or killed. The communists subsequently declared the campaign was over as the northeastern Guizhou region was secured.

It was a single-seat, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable landing gear. Development The first prototype of the Caproni Vizzola F.5. The F.5 was developed in parallel with the Caproni Vizzola F.4, with which it shared a common airframe. Design began in late 1937 by a team led by F. Fabrizi. The aircraft had a welded steel-tube fuselage and wooden wings; the fuselage was covered with flush-riveted duralumin, while the wing had a stressed plywood skin. The F.5 (standing for Fabrizi 5) had a two-row 14-cylinder Fiat A.74 R.C. 38 radial engine, unlike its cousin the F.4, which Fabrizi and his design team intended to be powered by a water-cooled engine. The F.4 project was not pursued immediately because the Italian Air Ministry held its proposed engine in disfavor, but development of the F.5 continued.Green and Swanborough, p. 109 The F.5 prototype first flew on 19 February 1939. The aircraft displayed very high maneuverability during official testing, prompting an order for both a second prototype and 12 preproduction models. The last of the preproduction aircraft was selected for use as a prototype in a renewed F.4 program, but the rest of the F.5 order was delivered to the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force). No F.5 production models were built as Caproni decided to produce the more developed Caproni Vizzola F.6M fighter instead. Operational history A preproduction Caproni Vizzola F.5.

Youth and high school Sirr Parker, who was raised in South Central Los Angeles and graduated with honors from Alain Leroy Locke High School, was abandoned by his father when he was three, his mother, who struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse, and raised by his grandparents, and later Parker and his infant brother Donyea stayed with his aunt and uncle. Parker became the Los Angeles Times player of the year, first-team all-state and a second-team All-American pick by USA Today by leading the Los Angeles area in rushing (4,000 yards) and scoring (50 touchdowns) as a senior at Locke High School while playing for a team that went 0‚Äì9 that season. He was also the homecoming king and an honor roll student with a 3.9 grade-point average. College Parker was a running back at Texas A&M;, where he was known for his speed and playmaking ability. He ran a 4.24 40-yard dash which is still a school record, and held the school vertical leap record of 40.5 inches (later broken by Terrence Murphy). Although injuries cut down on his playing time, he finished his college career by leading the Aggies to the 1998 Big 12 Conference championship his senior year. He helped A&M; rally to defeat number 2-ranked Kansas State in the championship game, scoring a touchdown and a two-point conversion late in regulation to tie the score. He scored the winning touchdown on a 32-yard slant from Branndon Stewart on third-and-17 in the second overtime, sealing a 36‚Äì33 victory and earning the Aggies an invitation to the Sugar Bowl. On the year, he rushed for 226 yards and a touchdown on 69 carries while catching eight passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns, and returning nine kicks for 200 yards. His best overall season was his junior year, when he rushed for 800 yards and a team-leading 10 touchdowns on 149 carries (for 5.4 yards per carry) on his way to becoming a Doak Walker Award nominee. He also caught 18 passes for 194 yards and returned five kickoffs, including a 78-yard touchdown return‚Ä¶ As a sophomore, he led the Aggies in rushing with 704 yards and two touchdowns on 149 carries while taking the only kickoff he returned 100 yards for a touchdown. As a true freshman, he finished third on the team with 312 yards on 71 carries while catching four passes for 77 yards. Overall as an Aggie, Parker rushed for 2,042 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. Professional career =NFL= Although Parker was not chosen in the 1999 NFL Draft, he was signed as an undrafted free agent by the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers released Parker in August 1999; he was then signed by the Carolina Panthers. However, he was unable to join the active roster because of a lingering hamstring injury that he sustained at Texas A&M.; Parker was placed on the inactive list before being waived once again. Prior to the 2000 season, Parker was picked up by the Cincinnati Bengals. Because of both his speed and the team's lack of depth in the secondary, the Bengals switched Parker to cornerback, a position he had not played since high school. He spent most of the season on the practice squad. Although he was activated for the last three games of the season (seeing playing time in the final two), he did not record any offensive or defensive statistics. Upon his arrival at Cincinnati's mini- camp in May, Parker was released from the team. =CFL= Parker was signed by the British Columbia Lions prior to the 2001 season, but was released before the start of the season. He signed as a free agent with the Calgary Stampeders the following year. In his first preseason game, he rushed for 66 yards on three carries, but did not make their opening roster, and was once again released. =AFL= Parker was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Desperados to play receiver and defensive back in December 2002. He was inactive for the first nine games of the season before being placed on injured reserve in April 2003. He was activated with one game remaining in the season, but did not play in the season finale or in the playoffs. In January 2004, the Austin Wranglers traded for Parker, but he did not see playing time for the team. =Semi- pro= Parker played the 2005 and 2006 seasons for the Inglewood Blackhawks, a professional developmental football (minor league) team in the La Belle Community Football League. In 2006 Parker was named League Offensive MVP and team MVP when he had 95 receptions and 16 receiving touchdowns, both league records. His 6,578 total yards gained that season is second all-time in minor league football history.

Over the next thirty years, Walker designed and built some 100 homes in Southern California. He designed numerous \\"case-study\\" homes, exploring the adaptability of new ideas in small houses. He was known for his ability to hold down construction costs. From 1958, Walker lived in the 4,300 square foot hilltop home in Ojai, California, that he had designed and built, and which he considered his masterpiece.

The Chaimite was originally an unlicensed derivative of the Cadillac Gage Commando assembled and later produced in Portugal, with a number of improvements and technical modifications. There were two versions of the Chaimite, the VBTP V-200 and the VBPM V-600. The VBTP (Viatura Blindada de Transporte de Pessoal, Armoured Personnel Transport Vehicle), had an 11-man capacity and was armed with one .50 Browning heavy machine-gun, while the VBPM, (Viatura Blindada Porta-morteiro, Armoured Mortar Carrier Vehicle), had only a 4-man capacity and was armed with one Browning .30 heavy machine-gun and one 81 mm mortar. These vehicles had diesel engines with 155 hp (115 kW) at 3300 rpm with automatic gear capable of taking on speeds to a maximum of 99 km/h (62 mph). The armour of this APC was capable of defeating rounds up to 7.62 mm NATO. The Chaimite was gradually phased out of Portuguese Army service since 2008 and replaced by the Austrian Pandur II 8x8 APC,Monteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), pp. 80-95. though the last operational Chaimite armored cars were only retired in 2016.Monteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), pp. 152-156. History Designed in the mid 1960s for the Portuguese Army, in its original incarnation the Chaimite resembled a modified Cadillac Gage Commando, leading to speculation that Bravia had produced it under license from the United States. A hearing held before the United States House of Representatives in 1977 verified that no such license had been granted, and that two former Cadillac Gage employees had been prosecuted for illegally transferring the technical knowledge for the Commando design to Bravia. The first prototype Chaimite appeared in 1966, and was designed primarily for direct fire support, with a large turret ring and braced chassis to carry a 90mm low-pressure cannon. In 1968 or 1969 the prototype was sent to Portuguese Guinea for combat trials, where it performed well but was later destroyed by African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) insurgents with an RPG-2 or RPG-7. The base Chaimite subsequently spawned several variants designed for internal security, anti- tank purposes, and medical evacuation. By the time production ceased, over 600 had been manufactured for the Portuguese Army and export. Variants *V-200: armoured personnel carrier *V-200 Armada 60: special variant for the Portuguese Marines of the V-200 armed with a multiple 60 mm rocket launcher *V-300: light fire support with 7.62 NATO to 20 mm gun *V-400: heavy fire support with 90mm or 75mm low-pressure gun *V-500: communications and command vehicle *V-600: mortar carrier with 81 mm or 120 mm mortars *V-700: anti-tank with Swingfire or HOT missile launcher *V-800: ambulance *V-900: armoured recovery vehicle *V-1000: anti-riot with water cannon Combat history =Africa= Libya placed an order of 60 V-200 Chaimite armored cars in June 1976, though only 13 or 16 were delivered. The Libyan government cancelled the order upon hearing that the Portuguese government had decided that same year to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, an act that infuriated President Muammar Gaddafi who immediately severed the diplomatic and commercial ties with Portugal in protest, which left the remaining 25 vehicles still in production at the assembly line of the Bravia VM plant in Samora Correia.Monteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), pp. 41-55. The batch of V-200 Chaimite armored cars that was shipped to Libya prior to the break-up of diplomatic relations was assigned to the Presidential Guard, with one of the vehicles being later sent to Lebanon; the other remaining vehicles were kept in service until the overthrow of the Gaddafi Regime in October 2011. Their present status is unknown, though some unconfirmed reports claim that they have been used in combat on the ongoing Libyan Civil War. =Asia= Twenty V-200 Chaimite armored cars were acquired in 1973 by the government of the Philippines for its Philippine Army units fighting the Muslim separatist guerrillas in Mindanao during the Moro conflict, but only 13 were actually delivered before the order was cancelled by the Philippine authorities.Monteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), pp. 36; 55. =Middle East= Lebanon was the first Middle Eastern country to place a request in December 1972 of thirty V-200 Chaimite armored cars for its Internal Security Forces (ISF), though only twenty-one vehicles had been delivered by April 1975, when occurred the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990), a conflict in which they saw considerable action.Monteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), p. 41. During the Battle of the Hotels in October 1975, the ISF used their own V-200 armored cars alongside loaned M113 and Panhard M3 VTT armored personnel carriers (APCs) by the Lebanese Army in a successful operation to evacuate more than 200 people ‚Äì including the staff and residents, most of them tourists ‚Äì trapped in the Holiday Inn and adjoining hotels located at the Minet el-Hosn hotel district of downtown Beirut. When the ISF collapsed in January 1976, the Christian Tigers Militia and Guardians of the Cedars (GoC) militia were able to seize an unspecified number of V-200 armored cars, which the GoC later employed against the Syrian Army at Houche el-Oumara during the Battle of Zahleh on April‚ÄìJune 1981.An ex- ISF V-200 Chaimite employed by the Guardians of the Cedars pictured at Houche el-Oumara during the Battle of Zahleh, April‚ÄìJune 1981. The vehicles operated by the Tigers Militia were reportedly employed in the defense of the Christian-controlled east Beirut quarters during the Hundred Days' War in February‚ÄìApril 1978, but after the forcible disbandment of the militia in October 1980 they were eventually returned to ISF ownership. The Lebanese ISF Command was so impressed by the performance in the field of its V-200 Chaimite armored cars ‚Äì notably, the Lebanese crews praised the ability of their vehicles armored hull to withstand in an Urban combat environment small-arms fire, landmine blasts and even RPG-7 anti-tanks roundsMonteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), p. 42. ‚Äì that they requested further nine or 10 vehicles in 1980, which were delived by 1982. Later in August 1990, the Lebanese showed interest in acquiring an additional thirty V-200 armored cars along with 15 Bravia Commando MK III patrol cars for the ISF, but those plans were eventually scrapped upon the conclusion of the civil war in October that same year. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla factions operating in Lebanon received from Libya a single vehicle in 1981, which was later captured in the Beqaa Valley by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) during the 1982 Lebanon War.http://www.ecsbdefesa.com.br/fts/Chaimite =Latin America= Peru was the first foreign customer of the Chaimite, purchasing in 1970 twenty V-200 armored cars for its Marine corps, which were delivered in 1971‚Äì1973.Monteiro, Berliet, Chaimite e UMM ‚Äì Os Grandes Ve√≠culos Militares Nacionais (2018), pp. 33; 55.

It was designed by the German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt. At various stages, Spain and India were involved in the development program. Spain was financing two projects, the HA-200 and the Hispano HA-300, but cancelled the HA-300 project before a prototype was built due to overruns. Egypt then took over financing, and the program was transferred to Egypt where both it and its engine would be made, and where the aircraft was successfully flown. Near the end of the program, India began financing the development of the E-300 engine for use in the Indian HF-24 Marut jet fighter. The HA-300 was an ambitious and costly project for Egypt, at a time when it was seeking to expand both its civilian and defence aviation industry. Six aircraft had entered service before the project was terminated in 1969. Design and development = Origin = Following their defeat at the end of World War II, the West Germans were prohibited from undertaking any research or development related to aircraft until 1955, which left Willy Messerschmitt looking for work. He therefore moved to Spain where he joined Hispano Aviaci√≥n and started designing an ultralight fighter aircraft in 1951. A lack of funds slowed the aircraft's development and Messerschmitt was able to build only a delta-shaped tailless plywood glider. Towed by a CASA 2.111, the test flight for the glider was prematurely terminated due to instability and the airplane did not become airborne. Due to funding problems and the resultant long development time, Spain abandoned the project in 1960. Front view of HA-300 showing tailed delta-wing and the undercarriage Egypt then acquired the design from Hispano Aviaci√≥n. The design team, headed by Messerschmitt, moved to Helwan, Egypt, to continue its work on the HA-300, which now stood for Helwan Aircraft 300. Ferdinand Brandner, an Austrian jet engine expert, was also invited to develop a turbojet for the new fighter. Egypt aimed to produce a lightweight supersonic, single-seat fighter that could join the Egyptian Air Force as an interceptor. =HA-300= Development of the Egyptian HA-300 started in the test facilities and workshops in Factory No. 36 in Helwan, southeast of Cairo, under the supervision of the Egyptian General Aero Organisation (EGAO), beginning officially in 1959. The first prototype of the HA-300, powered by a 2,200 kgp Bristol Siddeley Orpheus 703-S-10, first flew on 7 March 1964, and achieved Mach 1.13. Egypt sent two Egyptian pilots to India in 1964 to prepare for the HA-300 flight development. It was followed by a second Orpheus-powered prototype which first flew on 22 July 1965. The third and last prototype was fitted with the Egyptian E-300 engine, which it was hoped would make it capable of attaining and Mach 2.0 within 2.5 min after takeoff. This prototype was flight-tested at least once when it achieved a speed of Mach 2.1 with the Egyptian Brandner E-300 engine. A total of 135 million Egyptian pounds was spent on the development, while the E-300 engine was transferred to the Indian government for use in the HAL HF-24 Marut fighter. =E-300 Engine= Brandner E-300 engine The HA-300 fighter was originally designed around the afterburning Bristol Siddeley Orpheus Orpheus 703-S-10 turbojet, but aside from whether the British would even release it for use by the Egyptians, President Nasser saw that being dependent on a British engine was a major threat to national security, due to the potential for an embargo to ground the aircraft thanks to continued British hostility toward Egypt following the 1956 Suez crisis when Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt. The HA-300 was modified for the Egyptian Brandner E-300 engine, whose planned output was to have been of thrust on afterburner, which would also improve the HA-300's performance. India assisted in funding its development in exchange for their use of it as the powerplant for their HF-24 Marut. The E-300 ran successfully for the first time in July 1963. =Termination= The Helwan-300 project was cancelled on May 1969. The reason was not publicly stated but financial and political factors likely played a part. The German engineers working on the design were forced to leave Egypt after receiving multiple death threats from the Israeli Mossad. In order to fill the now vacant role, Egypt established close contacts with the Soviet Union and purchased Soviet aircraft instead of continuing to develop indigenous designs.

It was formed in 1986 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Jouni M√∂mm√∂ and lead guitarist Arto \\"Otra\\" Romppanen. Their musical style could be described as a mixture of goth and death rock, punk and metal with heavy stoner rock and hints of grunge. Career Before Mana Mana, M√∂mm√∂'s band was Silmienvaihtajat (\\"Eye changers\\"), named after the poem of Uuno Kailas. Most of the band's lyrics had been written at that time. This band's music can be heard on Silmienvaihtajat: 1985-1986 (Svart SVR077CD). Mana Mana's trademark was to use multiple overdubbed, distorted guitar tracks in their studio recordings, as many as 8‚Äì12 per track. Their heavy music was accompanied by haunting vocals by M√∂mm√∂ sung in Finnish. Jouni M√∂mm√∂ wrote all the lyrics for the group, and the texts often dealt with topics filled with religious symbolism, personal revelations, the apocalypse, death, psychedelia, insanity and stories of love gone wrong. The lyrics were often blaming (sometimes attacking Christianity) and typically depressing, gloomy and mentally disturbed. The name of the band is apparently a reference to the concept of mana in Polynesian mythology. Their career was rather short; during their original existence Mana Mana made only a few vinyl singles and one LP album, \\"Totuus Palaa\\" (engl. The truth is burning), which was released in 1990. Their inability to continue was because of M√∂mm√∂'s deteriorating mental condition ‚Äì he suffered from schizophrenia, had been in and out of a mental institute and became almost catatonic at some point, thus making it impossible for the band to create new material and to do live shows. One of their final efforts was to re-record vocal tracks with English translations of some of their songs from \\"Totuus palaa\\" in order to achieve a possibility of success abroad. These songs were \\"Totuus palaa\\" (retitled \\"Truth is Burning\\"), \\"Ilmestyskirjan peto\\" (\\"The Beast\\"), \\"Kuolla El√§v√§n√§\\" (\\"To Die Alive\\") and \\"Ket√§ s√§ rakastat?\\" (\\"Who Do You Love?\\"). However, M√∂mm√∂ was already too deranged to perform and his voice was barely audible. The recordings weren't released until after his death on the \\"Complete ... Kaikki\\" CD compilation. Jouni M√∂mm√∂ committed suicide by taking an overdose of drugs on 26 October 1991. He was 35 years old. After M√∂mm√∂'s death, Mana Mana played many live shows as a tribute, with two different vocalists, Kimmo \\"Kaltsu\\" Kuosmanen and Sami Tiilama. In 1998, lead guitarist Otra Romppanen started to compile song material out of old 4-track demos, rehearsal tapes and notebooks. A new Mana Mana album, \\"Murheen Laakso\\" (engl. A Valley of Tears) was released in 2000 as a tribute to Jouni M√∂mm√∂. Sami Tiilama did most of the vocal parts, and Antti Litmanen from Babylon Whores featured as one of the guitarists on the album. He also accompanied on Mana Mana's \\"burial tour\\" the same year. A live CD was made of their final show at Tavastia Club, Helsinki in the 2001. It was titled \\"Kuolla el√§v√§n√§\\" (engl. To Die Alive) and was released in 2004. After the official split-up of the actual band, former Mana Mana members have continued performing tribute concerts under moniker Murheen laakso. Many Finnish artists have covered their songs in their live acts, and Finnish groups such as Kotiteollisuus, PMMP and Viikate have recorded their own cover versions of Mana Mana songs.

The word may also refer to a bezel setting for a stone, which is a general term for a setting holding the stone in place using a raised surrounding for the stone with a lip encircling and overlapping the edges of the stone, thus holding it in place.\\"A bezel setting is a metal rim that holds the gem in a finger ring. The term is used in a transferred sense by horologists to denote the ring that secures the glass in a watch or clock, and by metal specialists to describe the ring inside the lid of silver and pewter objects\\", Campbell. Modern bezel settings typically use a band of metal containing a groove and a flange (i.e. projecting lip) to hold a watch crystal or gemstone in its setting. This was the earliest method of setting gemstones into jewelry. In historic examples, such rings were often made by leaving a hole or slot in the ring with a thin lip which was bent over once the stone was inserted, holding it in place. An extension of the word used in this sense can refer to a rotatable rim on a clock or watch used to indicate certain data such as elapsed time.Oxford English Dictionary (all editions to 2013), \\"Bezel\\", n. 3. However the OED definition misses the primary sense given in its own citations, such as: \\"1616 J. Bullokar Eng. Expositor, Bezill, the broad part of a ring, in which the stone or signet is set.\\", only defining it as \\"The groove and projecting flange or lip by which the crystal of a watch or the stone of a jewel is retained in its setting.\\" For examples of \\"bezel\\" referring to flat, thick parts of rings with no gems, flanges or lips see the over 2,000 uses of the word (in records with images) in the British Museum collection database.Webster's New World College Dictionary (2005) Other types of bezels, less used in modern jewelry, are \\"swivel bezels\\" where the bezel, perhaps just formed of a stone with a metal rod through it, can rotate, and \\"box bezels\\", where a \\"box\\" or cage forms the bezel, often sitting on the main ring hoop, and perhaps open at the top where there is a stone.Examples in the British Museum, with descriptions: Gold ring with movable circular box-bezel decorated with a griffin (also swivels); box bezel, no stone; The \\"Ashburnham Ring\\", with swivel bezel. In gem-cutting the term bezel is used for the sloping faces (or facets) of a cut stone surrounding a flat \\"table\\" face.OED, \\"Bezel\\" noun, 1 and 2; \\"In lapidary usage, the oblique sides or faces of a cut gem\\", Campbell. More broadly, bezels are found on tools and appliances. The sloping face of a chisel is known as a bezel. In vehicles, it is the part of the vehicle's bodywork that surrounds a headlight or turn signal.\\"bezel\\". Dictionary.com. Based on the Random House Dictionary. Retrieved July 11, 2013.

Bezel settings Diamond held in its setting with a bezel In making a typical modern bezel setting, the bezel is shaped into the size and shape of the gem and then soldered into place on the metal of the jewelry. The prepared stone is then placed into the bezel and the metal is pressed down over the edges of stone, locking it into place. A cabochon stone, a gemstone that is not faceted, usually relies on the shallow angle cut into the side of the stone, which helps the metal to stay in place. With a clear faceted stone, such as a diamond, a shallow groove is cut into the bezel itself. The girdle, or widest part of the gem stone, is placed in the bezel, which is then pushed down over the girdle. The pressure of the bezel over the edge of the diamond keeps it in place. Bezel settings for diamond rings are also called rub-over settings; they have a diamond completely surrounded by a precious metal band which fastens the diamond securely into place. Bezel settings use a type of elevated collar which wraps the rim of the diamond in a complete metal edging. This type of diamond ring setting is the most secure fastener for the stones. The bezel setting also protects the diamond better than other types of settings, such as the prong setting. A flush setting for diamond rings is a variation on the rub-over or bezel setting. In the flush setting, the stone is placed into an opening and affixed at the bottom of the stone. The top of the diamond is extended above the base. Advantages One advantage of the bezel setting, as compared to the prong setting, is that the diamond is better protected from accidental rubbing or blows, and is less likely to allow the diamond to scratch whatever it may come into contact with. The bezel setting is also more secure, so the diamond is less likely to be dislodged.

It carries Estero Boulevard (County Road 865) and is long from end to end. Each bridge on the Bonita Beach Causeway is named after the body of water it crosses. Route description Estero Boulevard (which crosses the causeway) begins just south of the Bonita Beach Causeway on Little Hickory Island, splitting off from Hickory Boulevard (County Road 865). It heads north and crosses Big Hickory Pass Bridge, which lands on Big Hickory Island. After a short distance, it then crosses the New Pass Bridge, and lands on Long Key, and enters the Lovers Key / Carl E. Johnson State Park. After crossing the Little Carlos Pass Bridge onto Black Key, Estero Boulevard turns west and crosses the Big Carlos Pass Bridge, a small single-leaf drawbridge, onto Estero Island, and the town of Fort Myers Beach. History Before the causeway's construction, the only way to access Estero Island and Fort Myers Beach by car was via the Matanzas Pass Bridge (which was still a small swing bridge at this time). The swing bridge's machinery was highly unreliable, which concerned islanders who feared the bridge would break down in the event of an emergency, such as a hurricane evacuation. The islanders felt having a second exit for the island for safety reasons would be wise. The county then decided the most feasible location was to run the causeway from the south end of the island over barrier islands to Bonita Springs. The causeway's exact routing was selected by surveyor Carl Johnson (for whom Lovers Key / Carl E. Johnson State Park was named), and he became known as the father of the project. Construction began in 1963, and the causeway opened on July 4, 1965.

The story is heavily action driven being influenced by on the author's love of video games and action films. Surprisingly, the book rests upon a foundation of classical literature and the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and David Hume. Reception Kirkus Reviews said \\"from the start, the action is fast, the suspense constant and the story always entertaining. Narrative techniques include an omniscient narrator, bold-faced comments and pep talks, letters and flashbacks. A complex mix of fantasy and science fiction will appeal strongly to adventure fans, gamers and reluctant readers. The combination of ambitious narrative, some overly explicit violent episodes and a few vulgarities will require maturity on the part of readers.\\" Christi Voth Esterle in her review for School Library Journal said that \\"the narration has the free-flowing, engrossing rhythm of oral storytelling, punctuated by poetic interludes that comment (sometimes ironically) on the action.

With his brother Les, he recorded \\"Bandstand Boogie\\", the theme to the long-running dance show American Bandstand. Biography Elgart was born in 1922 in New London, Connecticut, four years younger than his brother, Les, and grew up in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Their mother was a concert pianist; their father also played piano, though not professionally. Larry and Les both attended Pompton Lakes High School.Jackson, Kenneth T. \\"Elgart, Les(ter) Elliot\\" in The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, p. 147. Gale, 2000. . Accessed September 3, 2017. \\"During the 1930s the family moved several times, finally settling in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, where the brothers attended Pompton Lakes High School.\\" Both brothers began playing in jazz ensembles in their teens, and while young Larry played with jazz musicians such as Charlie Spivak, Woody Herman, Red Norvo, Freddie Slack and Tommy Dorsey. In the mid-1940s, Les and Larry started up their own ensemble, hiring Nelson Riddle, Bill Finegan and Ralph Flanagan to arrange tunes for them. Their ensemble was not successful, and after a few years, they scuttled the band and sold the arrangements they had commissioned to Tommy Dorsey. Both returned to sideman positions in various orchestras. In 1953, Larry met Charles Albertine and recorded two of his experimental compositions, \\"Impressions of Outer Space\\" and \\"Music for Barefoot Ballerinas\\". Released on 10\\" vinyl, these recordings became collectors' items for fans of avant-garde jazz, but they were not commercially successful. Larry and Albertine put together a more traditional ensemble and began recording them using precise microphone placements, producing what came to be known as the \\"Elgart Sound\\". This proved to be very commercially successful, and throughout the 1950s, Larry and Les enjoyed a run of successful albums and singles on the Columbia label. Their initial LP, \\"Sophisticated Swing,\\" released in late 1953, was credited to The Les Elgart Orchestra, because, according to Larry, Les was more interested than his brother in fronting the band. In 1954, the Elgarts left their permanent mark on music history in recording Albertine's \\"Bandstand Boogie,\\" for the legendary television show originally hosted by Bob Horn, and two years later, by Dick Clark. In 1956, Clark took the show from its local broadcast in Philadelphia, to ABC-TV for national distribution as \\"American Bandstand.\\" He remained host for another 32 years. Variations of the original song surfaced as the show's theme in later years. In 1955, the band became The Les and Larry Elgart Orchestra, but the brothers split in 1959, each subsequently releasing his own series of LPs. Larry signed with RCA Victor. His 1959 album, \\"New Sounds At the Roosevelt,\\" was nominated that year for a Grammy Award. From 1960-62, he released music on MGM Records. Larry and Les reunited in 1963 and recorded several more albums, ending with 1967's \\"Wonderful World of Today's Hits,\\" after which they went their separate ways. Les moved to Texas and performed with The Les Elgart Orchestra until his death in 1995.\\"Les Elgart, 77, Dies; Led a Dance Band\\", The New York Times, July 31, 1995. Elgart's biggest exposure came in 1982, with the smash success of a recording titled \\"Hooked on Swing\\". The instrumental was a medley of swing jazz hits - \\"In the Mood\\", \\"Cherokee\\", \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\", \\"American Patrol\\", \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\", \\"Don't Be That Way\\", \\"Little Brown Jug\\", \\"Opus #1\\", \\"Take the A Train\\", \\"Zing Went the Strings of My Heart\\" and \\"A String of Pearls\\" - that became so popular it even cracked the US Billboard Pop Singles chart (at No. 31) and Adult Contemporary chart (No. 20). This was the final hit for any artist in the year-long \\"medley craze,\\" that lasted from 1981 to 1982. Billed as \\"Larry Elgart and His Manhattan Swing Orchestra,\\" the LP from which the tune was taken hit No. 24 on the US charts. The follow-up, Hooked on Swing 2, debuted at No. 89 on the album charts, and soon after Larry was back to the jazz touring circuit. He continued to tour internationally and record into the 2000s.

The mall was originally anchored by Maryville-based Proffitt's (a regional department store), Walmart, JCPenney, Sears, and Goody's Family Clothing (a regional discount junior department store). Walmart has relocated outside the mall, with Belk taking part of its space, including an outside and mall entrance. A regionally based chain of pottery stores, Dixie Pottery, had a location adjacent to Belk. The store, which had no mall entrance, closed in 2007. The Proffitt's location closed after the chain was bought out by Belk; College Square had been the only mall in the region with locations of both Proffitt's and Belk.Cynthia Yeldell, Speculation on Turkey Creek's new tenants, Knoxville News Sentinel, November 18, 2005 In 2007, Kohl's moved into the Proffitt's space after expanding the building into a former parking lot. In 2008, a new twelve-screen Carmike Cinema was built over a large portion of the southern parking lot. The former theater was demolished. In addition, the Goody's Family Clothing store in the mall closed in 2009 with the bankruptcy of the retail chain, and then returned on March 17, 2011, within its former space. Sears closed in 2013. TJ Maxx went into half of the old Sears store along with Longhorn Steakhouse. On January 12, 2016, JCPenney announced it was closing in spring 2016.

The 1998 census gave the total of the Majangir population as 15,341, but since they live scattered in the hills in dispersed settlements (Stauder 1971), their actual total number is undoubtedly much higher. They live around cities of Tepi, Mett'i, and scattered southwest of Mizan Teferi and towards Gambela. Traditional toom instrument  Culture  They traditionally lived in small groups, farming for three to five years, then moving on as the fertility of the soil diminished (Stauder 1971). They were active bee keepers, collecting honey from hives consisting of hollowed logs placed in trees. They did some hunting and snaring of game and trapping of fish. They raised the bulk of their own food by farming, animals providing only a small part of their diet. Food production has changed since Stauder's time. The single most obvious change is that people are now living in permanent settlements. Livestock was not traditionally raised, but many Majangir have begun small scale livestock raising since about 1980. In addition, they have begun planting fruit and coffee trees, plants that take a number of years to produce a crop. The Majangir traditionally had a very egalitarian society, with no standing political leaders (Stauder 1971, 1972). The only people in official positions were people in the role of \\"tapad\\" (final implosive d), who served as ritual leaders. These were from the Meelanir clan, a group has links with similar- named privileged clans in other Surmic groups (Unseth and Abbink 1998). In case of a serious disagreement, one party would simply move away. There was no standard social reconciliation mechanism as is found in highland Ethiopian cultures. The Majangir have over 70 clans, with clan identity passed down through the male line. A person cannot marry a person from the same clan (exogamy), nor should they marry a person from their mother's clan (Stauder 1971, Unseth 1998a). Title page of the New Testament in the Majang language, 2018 The Majangir traditionally made two kinds of alcoholic drink: one from grain \\"t√°√°j√°n\\" (cf. tella) and one from honey \\"√≤g√≤√≤l\\" (cf. tej; Teramoto et al., 2005). The Majangir have traditionally used a number of musical instruments, sometimes to accompany singing and sometimes played without. Their instruments include a five-string lyre, thumb piano, drum, rattles, panflute. In addition, they play a vertically suspended marimba with as few as three wooden bars, but this is seen as a way of passing time, especially when guarding fields, rather than an instrument for music. Their vocal music includes singing of both harmonies and antiphonal parts. Often, this results in two parts being sung by women and two parts by men. Changes are happening rapidly to their traditional way of life. Since about 1971, many Majangir have become Christians (Hoekstra 2003 and Sato 2002). Further, since the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, with its subsequent remapping of Ethiopia by ethnic lines, the Majangir have felt very marginalized politically, their territory now divided among three kalil or administrative Regions (Sato 2000 and 2002). This frustration has led to some armed fighting with the government (Vaughan 2003:268).  Language  The Majangir language is part of the Surmic cluster, however it is the most isolated language in that cluster (Harold C. Fleming 1983). A language survey has shown that dialect variation from north to south is minor and does not seriously impede communication The language has implosive consonants (bilabial and retroflex), but no ejective consonants (Bender 1983). There are seven vowels, and length of duration of the vowel is also distinctive, such as goopan 'punishment' and gopan 'road'. In addition, two tones also distinguish meaning, on both the word level and the grammatical level: t√°≈ã (higher tone) 'cow', t√†≈ã (lower tone) 'abscess'.

Beginning with the 2011-12 school year, sixth grade will be provided at each elementary school while seventh and eighth grades will be provided at the recently renovated and underutilized high school building. The superintendent reported that closing of the middle schools would save district taxpayers about $800,000. C.W. Rice Middle School enrollment was 314 (2010). Sunbury Middle School enrollment was 355 students (2010).

Grace S. Beck School and Chief Shikellamy School were on the 15% lowest-achieving schools in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 2013, Chief Shikellamy School was once again listed. Parents may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year, the Pennsylvania Department of Education publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. The two Shikellamy schools were the only ones in Northumberland County on the list. According to the state report, parents in 414 public schools (74 school districts) were offered access to these scholarships. For the 2012-13 school year, seven public school districts in Pennsylvania had all of their schools placed on the list, including: Sto- Rox School District, Chester Upland School District, Clairton City School District, Duquesne City School District, Farrell Area School District, Wilkinsburg Borough School District and Steelton-Highspire School District.Olsen, Laura, State list of failing schools has 53 in county, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 26, 2012 Funding for the scholarships comes from donations by businesses which receive a state tax credit for donating.

With the State standards and everything we have to do with the state and Federal No Child Left Behind regulations, we have to really ramp up what we are doing.\\"WKOK radio 1070, Leaders and Lawmakers interview, December 20, 2007 In October 2009, Dr Lonoconus announced his resignation effective in November 2009. The district's policy is that if a student does not achieve proficiency on the PSSAs, a retest will be administered during the senior year for deficient subject areas. Failure to achieve proficiency in the retest requires a passing grade on a final examination and a passing course grade for any and all deficient subject areas reported by the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment. The student must pass both the course and the final examination in order to graduate. If a student fails to show evidence of this proficiency, the student can achieve a Shikellamy diploma by passing a summer school course or by returning for an additional school year to achieve a passing grade.Shikellamy School District Administration, Shikellamy Student Handbook, August 2010 The curriculum is currently under revision to align it with the 1999 Pennsylvania State Academic Standards. These standards are assessed in the third through eighth and eleventh grades under the guise of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment. These tests last several days and cover Reading, Writing, Speaking, Mathematics and Science. Revision of the Shikellamy School District's mathematics curriculum, to bring it into compliance with Chapter 4 regulations of 2000, was to begin in fall 2007. The poor academic performance of students in the district is evident beginning in 3rd grade with three of the four elementary schools far below the state average for reading. Oaklyn Elementary School achieved 81% of 3rd graders on grade level in reading in 2009. Mathematics scores, for 3rd graders, were similarly low with Grace S. Beck School having 55% on grade level in math, in 2009. It was the lowest- performing school in the IU16 region.

In 2013, Shikellamy School District administration reported that 514 pupils, or 17.2% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 42.4% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2011, the Shikellamy School District administration reported that 469 pupils, or 15.7% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 41% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2009, Shikellamy School District administration reported that 423 pupils, or 14.6% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 40.7% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Shikellamy School District has offered full-day kindergarten since 2003. Shikellamy School District has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves and has repeatedly sought an exception to raise taxes due to escalating special education costs. Full-day kindergarten has yielded no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress.Pennsylvania Bureau of Special Education, Pennsylvania Parent Guide to Special Education Services, 2008 To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. By Pennsylvania law, the district has 60 calendar days, after receiving parental consent, to complete the evaluation. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Shikellamy School District (SSD) received a $1,769,952 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011-2012 Fiscal Year, 2011 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. For the 2014-2015 school year, SSD received an increase to $1,812,375 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 *2015-16 - $1,873,958 *2016-17 - $1,916,284PDE, Education Budget 2016-17 by LEA Special Education Funding, 2016 *2017-18 - $1,955,255Finnerty, John., Spending Plan heads to Wolf, The Daily Item, July 1, 2017 In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. The cost of special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 31 or 1.09% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In June 2011, the school board approved a $36.2 million budget for 2011-12 that closed the two middle schools effective July 2011. The budget also froze administration pay and that reduced staffing by 24 positions. Beginning in 2011-12, the sixth grades will remain at the elementary schools, while seventh and eighth grades will be provided at the high school. The high school has been overstaffed, according to Superintendent Robin Musto, with 24 teachers not working a full teaching schedule and having 2 or more planning periods each day. Additionally, class size at the high school has been as low as 9 pupils for 15% of the classes, while many classes have 10-15 students. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, enrollment in the Shikellamy School District has declined 12.5% over the past five years, to a low of 2800 pupils. In 2006, the enrollment was reported by the administration as 3200 pupils. The Shikellamy School Board set the budget at $34.62 million for 2007-2008. The board levied a variety of taxes to support its programs. Taxes include 62.5 mills real estate tax in 2007. Per capita taxes are $5 per resident. An occupational tax, which charges a set amount based on job title, earns approximately $1.7 million. Many see this tax as particularly unfair, as people classified in the same job title often earn vastly different amounts, but pay the same amount of tax. An earned income tax of one-half of 1 percent of income yields a revenue of approximately $1.8 million. Additionally, the real estate transfer tax of one-half percent (Northumberland Borough, Point Township, Rockefeller Township) and one percent (Snydertown borough) is levied on real estate transfers. In October 2015, Shikellamy School board and the Shikellamy teachers union entered into a contract that assures teachers a 3% raise each year June 2014 to June 2019.Rick Dandes., Shik pact has 3% pay hikes, benefits revisions, The Daily Item, October 10, 215 Some adjustments were made to the benefits package offered teachers. During the negotiations, the board issued a last best offer to the union. In 2014-15, the district's mandated teacher pension contribution rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total salaries. Shikellamy School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education.

She earned two battle stars in service during World War II. Early career Antares was originally built under Shipping Board contract as the steel-hulled freighter Nedmac, and constructed by the American International Ship Building Corp.; acquired by the Navy on 14 November 1921 under the terms of Executive Order No. 3570 (29 October 1921) which authorized her transfer from the Shipping Board, she was renamed Antares and classified as a \\"miscellaneous auxiliary\\", AG-10. She was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 February 1922, Lieutenant Commander Howard E. Pinkham, USNRF, in command. After fitting out, Antares joined the Fleet Train, replacing the old auxiliary . In March 1923, the ship became flagship for the Train, Scouting Fleet, a squadron of auxiliaries that supported those elements of the Fleet operating along the U.S. East Coast. Though her unit was later administratively incorporated into the Fleet Base Force as Squadron 1, Antares continued to wear the flag of the officer who commanded the auxiliaries on the Atlantic coast. Throughout that period, the ship also served as the fleet target repair and photographic ship, a vital auxiliary to the fleet's gunnery training in the 1920s. Employed at East Coast ports and operating areas, ranging from the Southern Drill Grounds to the Caribbean, Antares, like other naval vessels, occasionally gathered oceanographic data in the course of her voyages; she re-plotted landmarks for range finder and compass calibration charts, furnishing the Hydrographic Office with data needed to complete the calibration chart of Culebra, Puerto Rico, during the fiscal year 1924. During this time period, Antares participated in fleet concentrations and maneuvers in Cuban waters and in the Panama Canal Zone. Antares brought the planes of Utility Squadron 2 (VJ-2) back to Naval Air Station (NAS), Hampton Roads, following the winter maneuvers in 1925, and for the winter maneuvers of 1926, transported three assembled and one crated plane from VJ-2 to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, where they towed sleeve targets for the Scouting Fleet's cruisers. Antares then transported VJ-2 to Coco Solo, and from there back to Guantanamo Bay. She again served as an aviation transport that summer, returning to Cuban waters in company with the repair ship . From 1 January 1934, Antares served as a supply ship for the Special Service Squadron and, from January to March 1935, as a Mobile Base for the Fleet Marine Force. She then operated in the Caribbean until 1 June 1936 under orders of the Chief of Naval Operations. Placed in reduced commission as of 4 June, Antares served as receiving ship at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Placed in full commission on 17 May 1937 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Antares was assigned temporary duty with the Naval Transportation Service (a forerunner of the later Military Sea Transportation Service and the Military Sealift Command), and operated on both east and west coasts. She also operated with the Training Detachment, United States Fleet, and while assigned to this unit participated in Fleet Landing Exercise No. 4 in February 1938. In his report of the evolution, Rear Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson‚ÄîCommander, Training Detachment‚Äîconsidered that Antares‚Äîwhich had acted as a \\"utility auxiliary\\"‚Äîhad proved \\"indispensable\\". He commended her performance of duty, which had been performed in spite of a \\"crammed schedule, allowing little or no time for upkeep.\\" Antares was the only ship available which could handle the experimental tank lighter, artillery lighter, and other heavy marine equipment. \\"Her design,\\" Johnson wrote, \\"except for speed, is ideal for the type of duty performed, and without her services serious curtailment of the operations would have been necessary.\\" The planned conversion of the ship to a general stores issue ship caused consternation at Headquarters, Marine Corps, General Thomas Holcomb pleading with the Chief of Naval Operations‚ÄîAdmiral William D. Leahy‚Äîto leave Antares in her current configuration, since she had proved so invaluable in the development of equipment and tactics in landing on a hostile shore. Ultimately, however, the conversion was carried out despite the marines' earnest entreaties. Resuming her work with the Base Force, United States Fleet, from mid-June 1938, Antares operated principally out of San Pedro, California, but later expanded her area of operations to the Hawaiian Islands and changed her base to Pearl Harbor. On 30 November 1940, the ship was reclassified to a general stores issue ship, AKS-3. During 1941, Antares operated between Pearl Harbor and the U.S. West Coast (San Pedro, Mare Island Navy Yard, and San Francisco, California), and Pacific islands such as Palmyra and Canton. World War II Antares was provided as transport to the Hawaiian Department, U.S. Army, during the urgent program to develop an air ferry route through the southern Pacific to the Philippines that would avoid the Japanese mandated islands of the central Pacific. On 3 November 1941 she left Oahu for Canton Island with three hundred and eight military (components of the 804th Engineer Battalion) and civilian personnel, supplies and towing a 500-ton barge with 804th Engineer Battalion construction equipment and two small barges that foundered en route. On 7 December 1941, Antares stood toward the entrance to Pearl Harbor at 06:30 with a steel barge in tow, having arrived from Canton and Palmyra and expecting to transfer the barge to a tug and then proceed into Pearl. Not sighting the tug at the appointed time, Antares altered course, turning slowly to the east, when her watch suddenly spotted a suspicious object about on the auxiliary's starboard quarter. Antares notified the destroyer , on patrol off the harbor entrance, and the latter altered course toward the object which proved to be a midget submarine. A PBY Catalina from Patrol Squadron 14 showed up almost simultaneously and dropped smoke floats in the vicinity; meanwhile, Ward went to general quarters and attacked, sinking the intruder. While the report of this incident off the harbor entrance was making its way up the chain of command with glacial slowness, Antares spotted the tug at 07:15. At 07:58, Antares spotted explosions in Pearl Harbor and Japanese planes; two minutes later an enemy aircraft strafed the ship, and soon thereafter, bomb and shell fragments (perhaps American \\"overs\\" or unexploded antiaircraft shells) hit the water nearby. As Antares captain‚ÄîCaptain Lawrence C. Grannis‚Äîsubsequently reported of events at that point, \\"As this vessel is not armed, no effective offensive or defensive tactics appeared possible.\\" Passing the tow to Keosanqua at 08:35, Antares zigzagged and turned to a position between the restricted waters of the entrance to Pearl Harbor and the entrance to Honolulu harbor, inshore of the warships beginning to sortie. \\"As it was apparent that the continued presence of the Antares offshore was placing the ship and personnel in constant jeopardy,\\" Grannis later reported, he requested permission to enter Honolulu. With permission granted at 10:54, Antares stood in and moored at 11:46 to berth 5-A. Although the work necessary to repair the damaged ships there took precedence, Antares underwent an availability at Pearl Harbor. During this period of alterations, she received her authorized main and secondary battery: two guns, four guns and eight anti-aircraft autocannons. Her alterations completed by 27 April 1942, the ship held brief trials and then began loading stores. Then, her holds full, she sailed for Pago Pago, Samoa, on 20 May, arriving 11 days later. Proceeding thence to Tongatapu, in the Tonga (or Friendly) Islands, soon thereafter, Antares reached her destination on 7 June. She remained there as a general stores issue ship until 1 September, when she shifted to Noumea, New Caledonia. She issued stores to fleet units at Noumea until 5 February 1943, when she sailed to the Fiji Islands and Auckland, New Zealand, ultimately returning to New Caledonia on 7 March. During March 1943, Antares took part in the successful salvaging of ‚Äîwhich had run aground on Garanhua Reef, off New Caledonia, on the 17th of that month‚Äîbefore being sent to Samoa, and from there to San Francisco, California, where she arrived on 6 May 1943. Following drydocking and general repairs, Antares returned to Samoa on 10 June, and proceeded from there to Espiritu Santo, arriving there on 18 June. A week later, she sailed for Efate, and thence to New Caledonia, arriving there on 5 July. Ordered back to the United States, Antares reached San Francisco on 1 August and, after reloading supplies and undergoing voyage repairs, again sailed for the South Pacific on 10 September, arriving at her destination, Espiritu Santo, on 4 October. Moving to Tulagi, in the Solomons, a week later, Antares replenished ships there until 24 October, when she returned to Espiritu Santo, and from there set course for the U.S. Reloading at San Francisco, Antares returned to Efate on New Year's Day 1944, but, eight days later, moved to Espiritu Santo and the Guadalcanal-Tulagi area. Expending her stores there, the ship proceeded from there to Auckland, and thence to the New Hebrides and Solomons, operating and issuing general stores in these areas until January 1945. Assigned then to Ulithi, in the Carolines, Antares arrived there on 10 January and issued stores until returning to Espiritu Santo in late January. She remained there until returning to the Carolines, reaching Ulithi on 11 April. Ten days later, the ship moved to Guam, and from there to Saipan for further routing to Okinawa to support the ongoing operations there. Antares reached her destination‚ÄîKerama Retto‚Äîon 10 May, and issued stores in that forward area until she was ordered to Pearl Harbor, via Saipan. Antares sailed alone from Saipan on 25 June 1945, bound for Pearl Harbor. At 13:29 on the 28th, Antares' lookouts reported a periscope and wake on her starboard quarter. Going to general quarters, the ship increased speed; her captain‚ÄîLieutenant Commander N. A. Gansa, USNR‚Äîtook the conn and maneuvered the ship hard right; the torpedo missed astern, but a close-range battle soon ensued. Simultaneously, lookouts observed what looked like a human-controlled torpedo (kaiten) in the port wake, turning to the right. At 13:31, the ship commenced firing at a periscope wake while she commenced an erratic zig-zag maneuver to avoid the kaiten on the port quarter, close at hand. While Antares stern swung to starboard, the No. 2 2 in gun, firing down the side of the ship, scored a hit on the kaiten and it disappeared. Another periscope soon appeared at 13:44; Antares after a 5 in gun opened fire, the concussion dazing the crew of one of the 3 in guns nearby (a severed phone connection had prevented them from getting the word to secure) and ripping open the ready-use boxes for the 3 in guns. Simultaneously, the stores issue ship's call for help was being answered; YMS-468 and the destroyer closed the scene of the battle to lend a hand. At 14:14, Antares sighted what appeared to be a large submarine commencing to surface; her 5 in gunfire, however, or the timely arrival of help, soon forced what looked like a quick dive. At 1418, Antares captain ordered \\"cease fire\\", but maintained the evasive action he had begun at the outset of the action. During the action, Antares expended 11 rounds of 5 in, 35 rounds of 3 in, and 130 rounds of 20 mm. She suffered four men wounded when a 20 mm shell hit a splinter shield; seven men suffered broken ear drums from the concussion of the 5 in gun going off directly over the 3 in gun they manned. Postwar records reveal Antares assailants to be , whose torpedoes missed their target, and the kaiten-carrying , which had departed Hikari on 15 June 1945 for the waters east of the Marianas as part of the \\"Todoroki\\" squadron‚Äîa special kaiten attack unit. Navy planes flying out of Saipan subsequently sank the latter on 29 June. Antares brought her eventful voyage to a close at Pearl Harbor on 9 July. She sailed for Ulithi on the 28th, and arrived there on 12 August as the war in the Pacific was coming to a close. Sailing for Okinawa on the 14th, she arrived there on the 19th. The ship subsequently supported the occupation of Korea and China, issuing stores and clothing to forces at Jinsen (now Inchon), Korea; Taku Bay, Weiheiwei and Tsingtao, China into the spring of 1946, departing Tsingtao on 18 April for Guam. Reaching that port a week later, on 25 April, Antares sailed for the U.S. on 2 May. Ultimately reaching San Francisco, California, late in May, the ship completed discharging her remaining goods and commenced inactivation. Decommissioned on 2 August 1946 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Antares name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 September 1946. On 18 September 1947, she was sold to Kaiser and Co. for scrapping. Military awards and honors Antares was awarded two battle stars for her World War II service.

Roy Genders considered that Bale's keeping in 1911, when Worcestershire came ninth in the County Championship ‚Äî their best finish until 1939 ‚Äî \\"contributed greatly towards such an excellent season\\". Bale played for Surrey's Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship as early as June 1902, but his first-class debut came exactly two years later, when he appeared for London County against Leicestershire at Crystal Palace Park. Bale claimed a single dismissal, of Harry Whitehead, scoring 4* and 22* with the bat. Later that month, Bale made his Surrey debut, against Oxford University at The Oval, and for the remainder of the season he divided his time between Surrey and London County. Following his final game for London County, he did not play another first-class game for almost four years. Bale played a few times for Surrey's Second XI in 1905, but then determined to qualify for another county, Worcestershire. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1953. He made his debut for Worcestershire in May 1908, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's; he performed two stumpings, held one catch, and scored 2 and 27. Although he only played eight more games that summer, the following year he was selected on 13 occasions, and by 1910 he had taken over from George Gaukrodger as Worcestershire's number one keeper. He was selected for The Rest to face champions Kent at the end of the season, and Wisden adjudged him second only to Strudwick in England. Bale played in two official Test Trial games in 1911, but made little impression in either and, with Strudwick now in possession of the England keeper's spot, never came so close to England selection again. For Worcestershire, however, he continued to play consistently up until the First World War; he made his highest score of 43 for the county against the touring South Africans in May 1912. After the war, he played a few more times for Worcestershire, but his place behind the stumps was now mostly being taken by the ill-fated Arthur Jewell and Bale retired from the game in 1920. Bale was an occasional bowler, and took the first of his nine first-class wickets for London County in 1904, claiming the scalp of Warwickshire's Tom Fishwick. His best bowling of 3‚Äì46 was achieved for Worcestershire against H. K. Foster's XI at Hereford in 1919.

It was the first part of the old canal to be designated a National Historic Landmark, prior to the designation of the entire New York State Barge Canal as a NHL in 2017. History =Tiononderoge and Fort Hunter= Located at the south east corner of the confluence of the Mohawk River and Schoharie Creek was the Native American fortified village of Tiononderoge. The name is Mohawk meaning \\"the meeting of the waters\\". The settlement was occupied from around 1710 to the beginning of the American Revolutionary War in 1776. It has been estimated that approximately 360 people lived in the village in 1713, declining to 204 by 1750. Europeans called the village the Lower Castle from its position as the major eastern settlement (furthest downstream) of the Mohawk. Fort Hunter and Queen Anne's Chapel In 1710, Peter Schuyler, mayor of Albany, invited three Mohawk chiefs and one Mahican chief (of the Algonquian-speaking peoples) to travel to England and visit Queen Anne to solidify their trading alliance. The Mohawk chiefs asked for help in defense against the French, including Anglican missionaries to offset French Catholic influence among their people. Numerous Catholic Mohawk had moved up to the St. Lawrence River valley, where they settled south of Montreal at a village they named Kahnawake, after their former Caughnawaga in the Mohawk Valley. The Mohawk offered help in settling Palatine German refugees in New York, who had arrived that year and were working in English camps along the Hudson River. Hendrick Tejonihokarawa offered Mohawk land near the Schoharie. Later it was offered to the Germans through Governor Hunter, and some settled in the Schoharie Valley. As a result of the Mohawk request for aid, Queen Anne authorized Schuyler to build Fort Hunter, named after Colonial Governor Robert Hunter; the complex was completed in 1712, located near where Schoharie Creek entered the Mohawk River. The fort was 150-foot square with a blockhouse at each corner. The main gate faced north. A wooden chapel was built at the center. The chapel was named after Queen Anne, who sent communion silver and other items to furnish it. In 1741, Queen Anne's Chapel was rebuilt using limestone blocks that were quarried locally. By 1775, colonists estimated 600 \\"praying Indians\\" (Christians) lived at Fort Hunter. Shortly thereafter, fighting broke out in the Mohawk Valley and across the colonies as part of the American Revolution. The Mohawks sided with England, as they had for the previous century in conflicts with the French. Fighting alongside the British at the Battle of Oriskany and the Battle of Freeman's Farm, the many of the Mohawk soon became disgusted with the British management of the conflicts and left to join their cousins, the Turtle clan, in the Saint Lawrence Valley. In 1780, Mohawk warriors joined Sir John Johnson and Joseph Brant in fighting against the rebellious colonists in the Mohawk Valley. They participated in raids known as the \\"Burning of the Valleys.\\" During one of the raids, a group of men retrieved Queen Anne's gifts, which had been buried at Fort Hunter. Today they are displayed at Brantford and Tyendinaga, Ontario, Canada. After the American Revolutionary War, Queen Anne's Chapel was used for a time as a tavern and stable, to house the many migrants at Fort Hunter, which had developed into a village. They were moving west along the valley into areas of New York state newly opened for European-American settlement since the Iroquois, as allies of the British were forced to cede their lands after the British defeat. The chapel was torn down during the construction of the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825. =The Original Erie Canal= Construction for the Erie Canal was begun on July 4, 1817 in Rome, New York. Within six years the section of the canal through Fort Hunter was completed (1822). The canal originally crossed through the creek in a slack water pool that was created by a log and stone dam. Remnants of which can be seen when the water is low, further down the creek. Boats would then be towed across while mules and horses were ferried. A towpath bridge was later built to help mules cross but the boats still had to make the dangerous crossing. The East Guard Lock and Original Erie Canal Prism remain at Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site is one of the only sites where the Original Erie Canal remains. It runs from the Schoharie Creek to the Enlarged Erie Canal Lock 29 - also known as Empire Lock. Along the way are some significant features. *A guard lock was constructed on the east side of the Schoharie Creek. This lock did not raise the level of the canal but rather protected the canal banks from high and often tumultuous waters in the Schoharie Creek. The Fort Hunter guard lock is the only guard lock that survives from the original canal. Folk lore states that the lock was built using the limestone blocks from Queen Anne's Chapel, which was razed to make way for the canal. *Further down the canal, near the Enlarged Erie Canal Lock 29, is the Original Erie Canal Lock 20. Lock 20 is the only lift lock that survives from the original canal. Though carefully filled in during the early 1980s to avoid total collapse of the stonework, this lock demonstrates the dimensions as well as situation of the original canal in reference to the Enlarged Erie Canal. Both Lock 20 and the guard lock were filled with gravel in 1980 to stabilize them. A view of Empire Lock 29 from the Enlarged Era Erie Canal. =The Enlarged Erie Canal= Soon after the original Erie Canal was completed, traffic outgrew it. By the 1830s, it was decided that the entire length would have to be enlarged to keep up with growing trade. The Enlarged Erie Canal construction era lasted from 1836 to 1862. During this time the overall length of the canal was reduced as well as number of locks. The canal locks were \\"doubled\\" - meaning that two chambers were constructed side by side. Schoharie Aqueduct, showing the canalway In Fort Hunter, the path of the canal was moved so that an aqueduct could be constructed across Schoharie Creek. Construction began on the Schoharie Aqueduct in 1839 by Otis Eddy and was completed in 1841. Fourteen arches spanning 624 feet carried the Enlarged Erie Canal and towpath across the Schoharie Creek from 1845 until 1916. In the 1940s, the Army Corps of Engineers demolished the easternmost six arches of the aqueduct to alleviate ice jams. A seventh arch collapsed during a 1977 flood, and an eighth collapsed on August 16, 1998. Six arches remain standing today. The aqueduct was named a National Historic Landmark in 1960. and The Schoharie Creek Aqueduct is on the Preservation League of NYS \\"Seven to Save\\" list for 2018-2019. Putman's Canal Store with Lock 28, also known as \\"Yankee Hill\\" Lock, of the Enlarged Erie Canal in front. The Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site includes many other remnants of the Enlarged Erie Canal. \\"Yankee Hill\\" Lock 28 and Putman's Canal Store are located off of Queen Anne Street. The lock was built during the enlargement in the 1840s. Putman's was built in 1856 by the family of Garrett Putman and was used as a canal store through the early 1900s. There is a small exhibit inside the building about canal stores of the era. \\"Empire\\" Lock 29 is located just east of East Church Street in Fort Hunter. It was constructed in the 1840s by James Ott and is one of the best preserved locks from the enlarged Erie Canal. Lock 30 was built by James Stewart in the 1840s. In 1956, the lock was filled in and paved over to make way for an adjustment to Main Street. =Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site= alt= The Fort Hunter Canal Society was formed in the 1950s to preserve the ruins of the Erie Canal in Fort Hunter. In 1966, the state-owned land at Fort Hunter was transferred to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site was formed. Throughout the years, many changes, additions, and improvements have been made. The Visitor Center - which opened in 1987 - is located at 129 Schoharie Street in Fort Hunter, Montgomery County, New York. When the parking lot was put in, remains of a stone wall were uncovered. The remains were believed to be associated with the original Fort Hunter and Queen Anne's Chapel. During the flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011, the parking lot was washed away, revealing the foundation for the mid-18th century Fort Hunter. A new exhibit in the Visitor Center, \\"Pathway to Empire: How the Erie Canal Helped Build America\\" opened in 2018 to mark the celebration of the canal's bicentennial. The permanent exhibit at the site interprets the history of the Erie Canal as well as Fort Hunter. It brings visitors through the progression of the canal system in New York from concept to construction and on to modern usage. Restrooms and a gift shop are located here. Yankee Hill Lock Picnic area is located on Queen Anne Street by Lock 28 and Putman's Canal Store. A boat launch and picnic area are located at the end of Dufel Road on the west side of the Schoharie Creek.

Easier immigration after the fall of Communism The fall of the Iron Curtain has permitted an easier movement of people in Europe. However, this movement has been accompanied by an increase in human trafficking by the organized crime. The victims of human traffickers are not free to pursue their business, but are usually compelled to work for the traffickers, typically in prostitution. Areas in central and Eastern Europe are now exploited as recruiting and transit locations to the west as well as final destinations for human trafficking. ‚ÄúAccording to Lidove noviny, 16 cases of human trafficking were uncovered in the Czech Republic in 2005, while it was three cases fewer in 2004. Growth of modern-day slavery Ten cases were registered by the police in 2003.‚Äù Despite the efforts of the international community, the modern day slavery is growing tremendously and is well covered up. Presently, women and children are the main victims of human trafficking. ‚ÄúLydie Err, in her report to the Parliamentary Assembly, said that 78% of women victims of trafficking were from central or eastern Europe‚Äù. Such figures arise due to the great unemployment especially among women, increased cross border movement, and corruption of local law enforcement organizations. Promises of marriage, jobs or education Cases where criminals promise great education for children from poor families and then force them into labor have also been detected. \\"According to the French human rights organisation, Albania is the county most involved in the sex trade, with women and children being lured to go to the West with false promises of marriage, jobs or education\\".

He was called the \\"world's rudest, worst, most insulting waiter\\" and worked at Sam Wo restaurant. Life Fong was born and raised in San Francisco's Chinatown. He worked the second floor of the Sam Wo Restaurant on Washington Street. (The restaurant name means \\"three in peace\\", a reference to its founding partners.) As head waiter, Fong greeted visitors with an admonition to \\"Sit down and shut up!\\" He was known for calling patrons \\"retarded\\" and \\"fat\\", criticizing people's menu choices and then telling them what they should order, slamming food on the table, and complaining about receiving only 15% tips. An imposing man with a crew cut hair style, he also was notorious for seating people with strangers, forgetting orders, cursing, spilling soup on customers, hazing newcomers, refusing to provide forks or English menu translations, and busing tables before diners were finished. Fong was made famous by columnist Herb Caen, who often described the misanthropic Fong during his visits to Sam Wo. Caen would interview Fong on matters of local politics and gossip, then reprint Fong's Yogi Berra-like responses, which Fong would in turn proudly show to his loyal regulars. Caen included Fong in his guide of things to do in San Francisco, under \\"58. See the world's rudest waiter\\". Shirley Fong-Torres described Edsel Fung as one of the main attractions of Sam Wo in her 2008 book The Woman Who Ate Chinatown, saying that customers \\"came to see and be verbally abused by Edsel\\". Although genuinely rude, his style was self-conscious and his role at the restaurant was not just to serve food but also to be a resident \\"entertainer\\" and \\"madman\\", with one longtime patron recalling him as \\"[not] rude. He was actually certifiably crazy. He didn't act that strange to locals, but the tourists got to him after a while.\\" Legacy Edsel Ford Fong food stand at AT&T; Park Fong was a regular recurring character in Armistead Maupin's series of Tales of the City novels, and was played by Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad in the 1993 Channel 4 miniseries. Fong had a cameo in the 1981 Chuck Norris film An Eye for an Eye. Robin Williams referred to Fong in his 1997 eulogy of Herb Caen: \\"'Oops, she (Pamela Harriman) is missing our table, going right to God's.' I hope they have a waiter like Edsel Ford Fong who goes, 'No water here. Only wine!'\\" A series of club-level bistros at Oracle Park are named \\"Ford Fong's\\" in his honor. He is also memorialized by a portrait on \\"Gold Mountain\\", a mural depicting Chinese contributions to American history on Romolo Place in North Beach, a few blocks from the restaurant. Sam Wo Restaurant continued to operate in Chinatown until 2012, still listed in one tourist guidebook as being where Fong practiced a \\"wicked sarcasm [that] took on aspects of performance art\\". The restaurant announced its temporary closure in April 2012, citing the age of the building and kitchen as a contributing factor in the closure.

Biography =Early years and World War II= He was born in C√¢mpulung. His father, Captain Ion Arsenescu, fought in World War I and was killed in action at the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti. Gheorghe Arsenescu graduated from the \\"Dinicu Golescu\\" High School in his hometown, and then, following in the military tradition of his father, enrolled in the Higher War School, in Bucharest. After graduating in 1924, he joined the 30th Regiment Doroban»õi from C√¢mpulung. At the start of World War II he was Operations Chief for the 2nd Mountain Division (V√¢nƒÉtori de munte), under the command of General Ioan Dumitrache. He fought in the Crimean campaign, was wounded, and then returned to the front. During the war he rose to the rank of colonel. He was decorated in 1940 with the Order of the Star of Romania, 3rd Class, and in 1941 with the Order of the German Eagle. After being discharged in 1946, he joined the National Liberal Party‚ÄìTƒÉtƒÉrescu. He started a small farm to provide milk to the C√¢mpulung market; accused of economic sabotage, he went into hiding. =Anti-communist resistance= In the summer of 1947 Arsenescu hid firearms at the in CetƒÉ»õeni. The following spring, he set up the \\"Dragoslavele\\" rebel group, which included Gheorghe Hachenzelner, Petre Cojocaru, Longhin Predoiu, Ion MicƒÉ, and Ion and Gheorge Purnichescu, and had the support of the monastery abbot, Pimen BƒÉrbierul. In the fall of 1948, the group dispersed, and Arsenescu, after spending some time hidden in C√¢mpulung-Muscel, went to Bucharest. There, together with a fellow army officer, Toma ArnƒÉu»õoiu, he formed in December 1948 a group named \\"Haiducii Muscelului\\" (Romanian for \\"The Hajduks from Muscel\\"). In March 1949, the two of them went to Nuc»ôoara, where they found shelter with ArnƒÉu»õoiu's parents and brother. Arsenescu started recruiting locals, arguing that he possessed armament, that he had personal contacts with the French Embassy, and that the West was bound to start a war with the Soviet Union, therefore the days of the Communist regime were numbered (a belief popularly known as Vin americanii!). His resistance group operated out of the Southern FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains; according to reports by the Communist authorities, the group was responsible for a number of robberies and murders. On the night of June 18, 1949, members of Arsenescu's group were ambushed by troops of the Securitate; in the ensuing firefight, two officers were killed, but the group of partisans escaped through a security cordon thrown around the area. After this close call, ArnƒÉu»õoiu and Arsenescu decided to split into two separate groups, so as to minimize chances the resistance in the area would be decapitated if they were caught together. Later that year, Arsenescu narrowly escaped capture yet again, once in Bughea de Sus and once in MƒÉ»õƒÉu, after being betrayed by some neighbors. In 1950, the Pite»ôti branch of the Securitate demonstratively executed, without trial, at Izvoarele, one of Arsenescu's aides, Traian Marinescu Geagu, a peasant student from D√¢mbovi»õa County. In the fall of 1951, Arsenescu was ambushed by the security forces while crossing R√¢ul T√¢rgului; badly wounded by gunfire, he managed to hide in the woods and found refuge in the home of Apostol Postoaca. =Capture and death= Arsenescu was finally captured by the Securitate on February 1, 1960. In February 1962 he was sentenced to death by the Bucharest Military Tribunal for \\"terrorist acts perpetrated as organizer of an armed group of anti- communist resistance\\", and was executed on May 29, 1962 at Jilava Prison. A notable member of Arsenescu's resistance movement was Elisabeta Rizea, who was captured by the Securitate at the same time as he was.

Economy =Ahmedpur sugar mill= The West Bengal government purchased the assets of the National Sugar Mills through a court sale on 4 June 1973, during its liquidation, enabling the West Bengal Sugar Industries Development Corporation to achieve its objective of promoting and developing the sugar industry, and also preventing job losses in the closed mill. After the Corporation took possession of the mill on 1 September 1973, it was renamed Ahmedpur Sugar Mill. It went into production in the 1974‚Äì75 season. It has a crushing capacity of 600 tonnes per day, and procures sugarcane from an area comprising the whole of Birbhum District, part of Bardhaman, Nadia and its captive farms in the district of Murshidabad, covering a distance over 25 km to 130 km from the mill gate. However, the scattered situation at a far off distance from the mill prevents the purchasing of an optimum quantity of sugarcane for crushing due to high costs related to transport. As a result of the difficulties for downscale plantations of sugarcane in Birbhum district and insufficient source of sugarcane from other zones, the working results of the mill for the above seasons were poor. This sugar mill has not been functioning for around 7‚Äì8 years. Another traditional industry is rice milling. Ahmedpur has a number of rice mills, some of which date from the pre-independence era. Ahmedpur also has the oldest Solvent Extraction Plant for Rice Bran Oil in West Bengal. Apart from the sugar mill there is also one wine processing factory. =Business= Ahmedpur is a growing centre for small and home-based business. Good transport links with Kolkata have enabled the development of a large market. Good transport facilities have allowed the growth of many small-scale handicraft industries. Goats, cattle and other animals are also sold in the market of Ahmedpur. Transport Katwa to Ahmedpur Narrow gauge railway line Ahmadpur Junction railway station is situated on the Bardhaman - Sainthia section of Sahibganj Loop. The 52 km long narrow gauge (2' 6\\") Ahmedpur Katwa Railway terminates in Ahmedpur. Four pairs of trains run daily in the section. It has remained a single line since its opening. Indian Railways took over the narrow gauge tracks between Katwa and Ahmedpur, and Katwa and Bardhaman from McLoyd and Company in 1966. The railways have identified low passenger numbers and unwillingness to buy tickets as the reasons behind the losses incurred by the narrow gauge section. The section has not been functioning for the last few years and the whole Ahmedpur-Katwa stretch is currently being converted to the broad gauge line. Nowadays the authority decided to turn this section off. The authority decided to make broad gauge railway instead of this narrow gauge. Construction of the new railway is currently underway. In a few days, passengers can enjoy a better railway service here. Now the conversion from narrow gauge to broad gauge is completed and also overhead electrification is done. On 22 November 2017 a trial journey took place from Ahmedpur to Katwa. Notable residents Rajat Bhushan Dutta, along with Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee (father of former Indian President Pranab Mukherjee) who was deported to Andaman Islands for 12 years for his involvement in the Birbhum Conspiracy Case, was born at Ahmedpur in 1908.

Somersville was founded in the 1850s by gold miners. It was named after Francis Somers who had discovered the Black Diamond Mine. Somersville was home to the Manhattan, Union, Eureka, Pittsburg and Independent mines. The town is no longer populated and is within the boundaries of the East Bay Regional Park District's Black Diamond Mines Regional Park. Somersville Road was named after the town; it is a major north- south arterial trunk road in the closest existing neighbor: Antioch. Somersville's ruins have a fairly extensive number of graves in the Rose Hill Cemetery, many of which contain dead miners who died in accidents in the coal mines. However the Rose Hill Cemetery was heavily vandalized till the East Bay Regional Park District took over in the 1970‚Äôs. The Somersville mines are now sealed to prevent entry due to frequent incidents of people becoming lost inside them during the mid 20th century. A post office operated at Somersville from 1863 to 1910. The name is in honor of Francis Somers, coal mine founder. A reporter for the Antioch Ledger, May 7, 1870 described the town: \\"...Somersville has a four general merchandise stores, one drug store, one hotel, two large boarding houses, several minor ones, a doctor, barber, shoemaker, no tailor, four saloons, purs et simple, not counting liquors dispensed at groceries. As an offset, we have a flourishing Lodge of Good Templars and Sons of Temperance. Odd Fellows and Red Men each have an organization. A Protestant and a Catholic Church shed their humanizing influence around, both being well attended. The public school is maintained nearly all the year round, by a special tax when the State funds fails; from seventy-five to one hundred scholars is the average daily attendance. There are two departments, and two lady teachers, under whose painstaking auspices the fundamental branches flourish.\\" In 1979, Somersville gained fame as the site of the largest historical archaeology excavation ever done in the U.S. at the time. Over 200 students from U.C Berkeley scraped and sifted through the eastern part of the townsite, recovering thousands of artifacts. The Public Broadcasting System examined the project in a documentary series on archaeology, Odyssey: Other People's Garbage.

He is the brother of Nashville politician David Briley and the grandson of Beverly Briley, Metro-Nashville's first mayor. Education and career Briley graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science from the University of Colorado in 1991, and obtained his J.D. and from Vanderbilt Law School in 1997. Briley was elected as a Tennessee state representative beginning with the 101st Tennessee General Assembly (1999‚Äì2000). During his 5 term tenure was a member of the House Ethics, Finance, Ways and Means Committee, Rules, Calendar and Rules, and Joint Workers Compensation Committees, and of the House Civil Practice and Procedure, and Criminal Practice and Procedure Subcommittees. He was Chair of the Judiciary Committee at the time of his resigning his position as a representative in 2008. Briley currently works as an attorney. His wife filed for divorce due to his infidelity. Legislative positions Briley voted against a bill that would have allowed Tennesseans with gun carrying permits to take their firearms into recreational facilities like state and local parks and playgrounds. He stated that a House bill that would have allowed citizens to carry guns in establishments that serve alcohol was a ploy by Republicans to get Democrats to vote against gun rights. He also stated that the bill shouldn't have been allowed to have been brought up because it was voted down in the same committee the previous year. Briley came out against a bill that makes it easier for men to end child support payments for children if paternity tests prove the children do not belong to the men. In the floor debate, Briley said \\"Yet you want to punish a child as the result of an adulterous situation,\\" said Briley. \\"You put the child in the position of bearing the burden of a parent's conduct.\\" Drunk driving incident Briley allegedly rammed the rear of a truck in Dowelltown, Tennessee on September 8, 2007, after which state troopers cited him for driving under the influence, evading arrest, and violating the implied consent law. The charges arose as a result of his allegedly having tried to escape the officers who pulled him over in Wilson County, starting a chase that, according to Watertown police, topped speeds of over 100 miles per hour (161 km/h). Briley was charged with drunk driving and leaving the scene of the two accidents after Watertown police stopped his vehicle. March 6, 2015  Ex-state Rep. Rob Briley found God on a linoleum floor  Brad Schmitt  During the incident, Briley asked police officers twice, to shoot him in the \\"fucking head,\\" and he called the Wilson County Sheriff's Department deputies \\"goddamn Nazis.\\" To one deputy, he said, \\"You're not an American, are you? You're a goddamn German!\\" Inside his car, police found a bottle of bourbon and three bottles of pills. Democratic leaders said that he would keep his legislative seat and Judiciary Committee chairmanship for now, though Governor Phil Bredesen said he should step down from his post as chair of the Judiciary Committee. On September 15, 2007, he resigned from his position as Chair of the Judiciary Committee. He stated he was being treated at Cumberland Heights alcohol and drug treatment center.  September 10, 2007  State Representative Rob Briley charged with DUI, other crimes  Walker Duncan  On March 4, 2008, Briley announced that he would not seek re- election to his seat in the state House. Following these events, Briley admitted that he is an alcoholic during a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives. Further reading * Brad Schmitt, 2015, \\"Ex-state Rep.

Central state institution, that oversaw economic and financial affairs in Habsburg lands, was the Court Chamber (), also known as the Aulic Chamber (), formed in 1527 by Ferdinand I, and centered in Vienna. History With the abolition of serfdom in the 18th century, the Habsburg Monarchy, with the major industrial, mining areas and forestry of regions Moravia and Bohemia leading the way, began to experience unprecedented economic growth. Beginning in 1841 per capita annual growth in the Habsburg monarchy approached 3.6 percent, a number rivaling that of neighboring Germany. While this growth was rapid and astonishing, it was not sustained. Within the next decade, a period of stagnation occurred, while other European countries began to experience a continued, steady growth. This slow down can be accredited, for the most part, to a period of ongoing war, beginning in 1848 and ending in 1866 with the Habsburgs' defeat by Prussia. This period of war, and a mounting budget deficit, took resources away from private industry, which discouraged industrial growth. This factor eventually brought the economy to a halt in the years after 1855. The Habsburgs' wars in the mid 19th century caused considerable economic backwardness through the rest of the 19th century. As other European economies had grown from the 1850s on, the Habsburgs' had shrunk, a consequence of the Habsburgs' continuing wars and Eastern Europe's continuing neutrality.

Early life Born Katharine Tennant in 1903, she was the daughter of the Scottish industrialist and politician, Sir Charles Tennant, Bt. (then seventy-nine years old) and his second wife, Marguerite Miles, daughter of Colonel Charles William Miles, MP and was cousin of Sir Philip Miles. As a child, she played in the nursery of 10, Downing Street, the home of her much older half-sister, Margot Asquith, the wife of then Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. Tennant when visiting her sister, threw her teddybear out the window of 10 Downing Street at the protesting Suffragettes. Tennant was educated at home by governesses, then at Abbot's Hill School and finally in Paris. She was presented at court to George V as a debutante but later stated 'I was more interested in politics than parties' and grew up with strong Liberal ideals.The Scotsman, 18 November 1989 Later studying at the London School of Economics, she was also an accomplished violinist, organist, equestrienne, golfer and fluent in French. Marriage On 2 April 1934, Tennant married Walter Elliott, a doctor and Unionist Party MP who was at that time the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald. At the height of his career Elliot was probably the most significant Conservative politician of Scotland. She was his second wife; his first had died on their honeymoon fifteen years earlier. Elliot was the son of a livestock auctioneer and she became an expert in trading farm animals and agricultural equipment. A donation of one shilling was also given by almost every farmer in Britain towards a wedding present, from which she purchased a tractor. Politics Elliot then became involved in Conservative affairs, wrote speeches for, and campaigned in elections for, her husband, as well as promoting his enactment of the Milk Marketing Board. Still in touch with her Liberal roots, she favoured prison reform and was an opponent of capital punishment. From 1939‚Äì49, Elliot was chair of the National Association of Mixed Clubs and Girls' Clubs (later known as Youth Clubs UK) and she sat on the Home Office advisory committee on the treatment of offenders from 1946‚Äì62, during which time she visited every prison in the kingdom. She also served on the advisory committee on child care in Scotland from 1956‚Äì65, was chair of the Conservative Women's National Committee from 1954‚Äì57 and was chair of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations from 1956‚Äì67. She became the first chair of the Consumer Council in 1963. On three occasions, in 1954, 1956 and 1957, she was a member of the UK delegation to the United Nations and in the absence of ministers during the Suez crisis in 1956, she made a speech denouncing the Soviet invasion of Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1946, awarded the Grand Silver Cross of the Order of Merit of Austria in 1963. In an 1958 episode of the BBC television programme The Brains Trust she described herself as an \\"unrepentant defender of votes for women\\". Following the death of her husband in 1958, Elliot took over from him as chair of the family auctioneering firm and stood in his place as parliamentary candidate of Glasgow Kelvingrove, but lost by a narrow margin of votes to the Labour candidate Mary McAlister in the 1958 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election. Knighthood and ennoblement In 1958, Elliot was promoted as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and created Baroness Elliot of Harwood, of Rulewater in the County of Roxburgh. As one of the initial four women who were created peers under the Life Peerages Act 1958, she was the first peeress to speak in the House of Lords,House of Lords Debates 4 Nov 1958, col 161. the first peeress to propose the loyal address and the first peeress to pass a private bill through the House (which was at the request of Margaret Thatcher from the House of Commons, making the bill the first to be taken through both houses by women). Death At the State Opening of Parliament in November 1993, Elliot tripped over her parliamentary robes and fell as she left the House of Lords. She was taken to hospital and died at Hawick Cottage Hospital near her Scottish home of Harwood, on 3 January 1994, aged ninety. She was buried at Hobkirk parish church on 8 January and a service of thanksgiving was held in her memory at the Church of St. Margaret, Westminster, on 14 April.

Boven (March 6, 1925 ‚Äì March 10, 2011) was an American basketball player, coach, and university instructor. He was a World War II veteran who was a standout athlete at Western Michigan University. After playing professional basketball, he served as an instructor at the University for more than 30 years. In the 1980s, Boven retired from his teaching duties but remained active in sporting circles and became involved in voluntary public service in his Michigan township. Early life and military career Boven was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1925. He was the second of four sons born to Thomas Boven and Jessie Knapper. His parents were immigrants from the Netherlands, having come from Groningen. Boven was raised on the north side of Kalamazoo and attended Lincoln Junior High School. He then developed into a successful athlete at Kalamazoo Central High School where he lettered in football, baseball, and basketball. He graduated from Central in 1943 and, after his graduation, enlisted in the United States Army to serve in Europe during World War II. He was a Gunnery Sergeant with the American Third Army and arrived at Omaha Beach on D-Day plus two. He also fought with the Third Army at the Battle of the Bulge. Following World War II, Boven returned to Kalamazoo where he enrolled at Western Michigan University with the help of the G.I. Bill to study for a degree in education. Basketball career =Western Michigan= Don Boven attended Western Michigan University from 1946 to 1949. He was an athletic standout while at Western and earned 11 varsity letters in football, basketball and baseball. In his final year at Western, he received the University's Academic-Athletic Excellence Honor Medal. On the basketball court at Western Michigan, Boven set the career scoring record with 1099 points between 1946 and 1949, though this record has since been broken. He is remembered as having successfully competed against players that were much taller than he was, such as Bowling Green's Don Otten. Boven also remains among the top ten for free throws made and free throws attempted. As a junior, Boven was named a second team All-American and in 1949, the senior was named a first team All-American. After college, Boven received offers to play professionally from the Detroit Lions in football, the Chicago Cubs in baseball, and several professional basketball teams. He chose to play basketball and was selected by the Indianapolis Olympians in the 6th round of the 1949 BAA draft. =Professional career= Don Boven shown on the lower right cover of the Waterloo Hawks' 1949‚Äì1950 program Boven began his career playing for the Waterloo Hawks in 1949. During his college and professional playing days, he stood 6'4\\" (1.93 m), weighed 210 pounds (95 kg), and played most of his career as a small forward. The team finished fifth in the NBA Western Division with a 19‚Äì43 record. Boven averaged about 10 points and two assists per game and was in the top 20 in the league making 37% of his field goals. The following season, the Waterloo franchise left the NBA to join the original National Professional Basketball League during its only season in existence. Boven led the entire league in scoring with 781 points. He was also named a member of the league's all-star team. More than half of the league's teams folded over the course of the year and no championship game was played. Boven's Hawks and the Sheboygan Red Skins made claims to being the champions, but the league was dissolved before the matter could be resolved. Waterloo finished the season with the most wins of any team behind Boven's scoring, but Sheboygan defeated the Hawks in 8 of their fifteen meetings. When the Waterloo franchise folded along with the NPBL, Boven was signed with the Milwaukee Hawks for one season. This team finished fifth in the NBA's western division and Boven put up numbers similar to his first year in the NBA. One lasting distinction came during that season. Boven was tied for third most personal fouls in the NBA behind George Mikan and Vern Mikkelsen. He also set a league record by fouling out of six consecutive games that season. Though this record was nearly broken in 1982 and skirted by Shaquille O'Neal in 2007, it still stands as of 2016. For the 1952‚Äì53 season, Boven was traded to the Fort Wayne Pistons by way of the Baltimore Bullets. Though his stats were slightly lower than his previous seasons, the Pistons made it to the playoffs after finishing with a record of 36‚Äì33. Boven and the Pistons competed in the Western Division semifinals, beating the Rochester Royals two games to one. The Pistons then lost to George Mikan and the eventual NBA champion Minneapolis Lakers in the western division finals. This was Boven's last season in the NBA and he finished his professional career with averages of 10.2 points, 2.0 assists, and 4.2 rebounds per game. Coaching and later life =Western Michigan University= After retiring from professional basketball, Boven began a long career as a coach and instructor at Western Michigan University. He initially taught sports and physical education classes while serving as assistant coach for the football, basketball, and baseball teams. During the 1958‚Äì59 season, Boven was promoted to head coach of the Bronco's basketball team. Boven's first season was not very successful and the Broncos went 2‚Äì20. In 1959‚Äì60 Boven put together the first of two winning seasons (12‚Äì11). The other came in 1961‚Äì62 when the team went 13‚Äì11. Boven coached at Western Michigan until 1966 ending his coaching career with a record of 75‚Äì112 (). His record in the Mid- American conference was 36-60 (). His relatively poor winning percentage has been explained by the fact that he scheduled his team to play the best competition available in order to improve their skills on the court. While he was working at Western, Boven also earned a master of arts degree in education from the University. He also played semi-professional baseball during the summer months for the Sutherland Paper Company team until the late 1950s. After his semi-professional career ended, Boven worked during the summers for the Kalamazoo Parks and Recreation Department as the director of the city's summer playground program. Boven was inducted into Western Michigan's hall of fame in 1975, at which time the school's athletic director noted \\"He commands respect with the history he represents in our university. He was an outstanding teacher and coach who continued to support Western.\\" =Retirement and personal life= Boven retired from Western Michigan University in 1985 after 32 years of working with the institution. After he had completed his professional basketball career, Boven married Charlotte Kniese on April 25, 1953 and the couple had three children. The two had met while both were students at Western Michigan University. The family lived on a small lake near Mattawan, Michigan.http://www.wmubroncos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4600&ATCLID;=205114961 He served as Texas Township Clerk for 12 years and was very active in his retirement. Boven had remained involved in basketball in his later years, playing in reunion games with the Waterloo Hawks as late as 2004. He was also a member of the National Basketball Retired Players Association. Charlotte Boven died in June 2010 and Donald died as a result of amyloidosis in his heart on March 10, 2011. He and his wife were buried at Fort Custer National Cemetery.

Prior to the publishing of Undersea, she wrote marine based radio scripts; these writings influenced her later works. The article broadcasts themes of ecology and the unwavering will to survive that marine organisms embody. After her article was published, Dutch-born children's author Hendrik Van Loon became interested in her work. He encouraged and supported her to continue this type of depiction of nature in her writing, as well as advised her about publishing.Lear, Linda J. Rachel Carson, Witness for Nature. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1997. Rachel Carson furthered these messages from her article and expanded these perspectives in Under the Sea Wind. These writing styles continued to appear in her following pieces. In the Penguin Classics publication, Under the Sea Wind was described as Carson's personal favorite book she authored. The failure to initially sell Under the Sea Wind is assumed to have been due to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and America entering World War II the same year the Under the Sea Wind was published.Chambers, John Whiteclay II, ed. The Oxford Companion to American Military History. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, 819-830.Lear, Linda. Under the Sea-Wind. RachelCarson.org. http://www.rachelcarson.org/UnderTheSeaWind.aspx Under the Sea Wind was popularized with the publication of the second book in the Sea Trilogy, The Sea Around Us, and it was this second text that truly established her as a natural history author. Description Under the Sea Wind describes the behavior of organisms that live both on and in the sea on the Atlantic coast. Under the Sea Wind consists of three parts, each following a different organism that interacts with the sea, and viewing it from a personified organism‚Äôs perspective. The first section, Edge of the Sea, follows a female sanderling Carson names Silverbar. The second section, The Gull‚Äôs Way, follows a mackerel named Scomber, and the third section, River and Sea follows Anguilla, an eel. The narrative follows these creature's migration habits over the span of a year. Viewing ocean life from a broader ecological perspective was crucial to Carson, rather than just isolating parts of the sea. The term \\"sea wind\\" was Carson's way of referring to the entirety of the shore, sea, and sky. Carson had a poetic way of writing about nature, while still maintaining the scientific accuracy of her observations. Her work draws connections between nature and home, the borders of interrelated communities, and the growing separation between man and nature. Carson took inspiration from natural history authors such as Henry Williamson and Henry Beston, and uses her scientific expertise to ground Under the Sea Wind in scientifically accurate detail on each animal's appearance, diet and behavior.Stewart, Frank. A Natural History of Nature Writing. Island Press, 1995, p. 170. .Quaratiello, p. 29. Carson's stated goal of using poetic prose and personifying sea life was \\"to make the sea and its life as vivid a reality for those who may read the book as it has become for me during the past decade.\\"Quaratiello, Arlene. Rachel Carson: A Biography. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004, pp. 26‚Äì27. . This writing style brought scientific observations to a larger audience, and as stated by fellow marine environmentalist author Joel Hedgpeth in a review of the book, allowed for \\"turning the subject of the sea to a respectable reading matter for the clientele of the New Yorker and Readers' Digest sets, and inspiring a fashion in literature about the sea, its ways, and creatures.\\" The style of Carson's writing makes the book suitable for children as well as adults, and the appeal is enhanced with illustrations, originally by Howard Frech. These were eventually replaced in 1991 with illustrations by Robert W. Hines. Though Under the Sea Wind is a story of struggle and chance survival, the style that Carson presents is in stark contrast to her later work, Silent Spring, which is much more dire and analytical.

Remes (born 1954) is an American lawyer. Remes was a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling. Most recently, Remes was \\"Counsel\\" at the Washington, DC law firm Gilbert LLP. Remes has been recognized for his human rights work. Volunteered to serve Guantanamo captives Remes is notable for volunteering to serve as a pro bono attorney for some of the captives held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. Remes played a role in a challenge focussed around the captives' detention based on an avenue of appeal that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) opened. The DTA closed the opportunity for captives who had not yet had writs of habeas corpus filed on their behalf. But the DTA allowed captives to challenge the determinations of their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, that they were properly classified as \\"enemy combatants\\". The DTA allowed captives to challenge the enemy combatant determination if the Tribunal failed to follow the rules laid out in their mandate. One aspect of that challenge was a request that the court force the DoD to release more information on the evidence used to justify the captive's detention. Leading officials in the United States counter-terrorism establishment appealed a July 20, 2007 appeals court ruling forcing the release of information about the captives on national security grounds. Remes responded: Remes is one of the attorneys for Saifullah Paracha, a Pakistani businessman who lived in the USA for several years, who is suffering from serious heart disease. Paracha has been appealing to get permission to travel temporarily to an American hospital for heart surgery. Camp authorities claim his heart surgery could be performed in Guantanamo's infirmary. They complained that $400,000 had been spent preparing the infirmary for his surgery. Paracha's lawyers have argued that previous procedures at Guantanamo have been botched. Brought Guantanamo cases to Federal court under the Detainee Treatment Act The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) closed off the right of Guantanamo captives to submit new petitions of habeas corpus. (Pending cases were left open.) The DTA opened a path for Guantanamo captives to submit a limited appeal to Federal Courts of appeal in Washington DC. The Military Commission Act of 2006 (MCA) closed down the pending habeas corpus cases. Attorneys for the captives have both initiated a challenge to the constitutionality of the MCA's stripping of the right to habeas corpus; and they have initiated appeals in the DC Federal Courts of appeal. The DTA's limited avenue of appeal only allows challenges as to whether the Combatant Status Review Tribunal correctly followed their rules. Remes was one of the first lawyers to initiate an appeal in the DC courts. Remes reacts to the Governments desire to \\"rewrite detainee evidence\\" On June 20, 2008 the Associated Press reported that the Government wanted to \\"rewrite detainee evidence\\". The impetus to rewrite the evidence is a reaction to the Supreme Court's June 12, 2008 ruling on Boumediene v. Bush. The Supreme Court had ruled that Guantanamo captives were entitled to challenge the basis for their detention through the US Justice System, because the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were not an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. According to the Associated Press: The Associated Press quoted Remes reaction to this development. Defense of Adnan Latif Remes continued his pro bono legal work on behalf of captives held in extra judicial detention at Guantanamo Bay, taking on the case of Adnan Farhan Abd Al Latif one of his most notable clients. Though Latif was ordered to be released in 2004, 2007, 2009 and lastly in July 2010 by district court Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., an appeals court that handles Guantanamo habeas cases reversed the decision in October 2011, and in 2012 the Supreme Court turned down the Latif case. Remes was quoted in a CNN article as saying related to the Latif case and efforts to get Latif transferred or released \\"So now, the executive is against transfers, Congress is against transfers and the courthouse doors are shut,\\" \\"All three branches of the government are aligned against us.\\". On September 8, 2012 Latif, who had a history of mental illness, was said to have committed suicide by the Department of Defense. and Remes via Amnesty International promised to continue his work on behalf of Guantanamo detainees who have been ordered released, only to have their cases reversed by appeals courts. However, Latif's cause of death is now in question. Publications * References 1954 births Living people Guantanamo Bay attorneys Place of birth missing (living people) Lawyers from Washington, D.C.

History Salisbury Hall, the main administrative building at Newbold College of Higher Education Moor Close Newbold College of Higher Education opened in 1901 as Duncombe Hall College in Holloway, North London to train church workers and ministers. It has undergone a number of name changes. The Newbold name was taken from its Newbold Revel location to the east of Rugby, Warwickshire, during World War II. Another wartime Warwickshire location was Packwood Haugh, between Solihull and Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire. In 1945 the College purchased Moor Close, which expanded to the present-day campus. One factor for this choice was its proximity to Oxford and London. The existing campus is located near the Heathrow Airport. =Moor Close= Moor Close is a Grade II listed redbrick Jacobethan house built in 1881. It was extended and altered c. 1914, with a complete Jacobethan interior, by architect and garden designer Oliver Hill for financier Charles Birch Crisp, to complement the terraces and gardens which Hill created over 1910‚Äì13. These are listed Grade II* in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Extending to the south and east of the house, the grounds contain a number of terraces on different levels, many linked by circular steps. There are courts, pergolas, staircases, balustrades and lily pools. Hill also built a stone bridge over a ravine, leading to Sylvia's Garden, named after Crisp's daughter. Moor Close was Hill's first major project, and was influenced by the work of garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. Campus Campus facilities include Salisbury Hall, Murdoch Hall, Roy Graham Library and Egremont which are the main academic and administration buildings. Moor Close, Keough House and Schuil House are student residence halls, and family housing is located north of the campus at Ashgrove, Beechwood and Ceder Close. Sports facilities include a gym equipped for basketball, volleyball, floorball, football, badminton and a football pitch.

He was president of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba during the 1970s, and later joined the breakaway Progressive Party. His son-in-law, Paul Edwards, was leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1993 to 1996.Bruce Owen, \\"Strong roots\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 April 1995. Early life and career MacKay was born in Winnipeg. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Winnipeg in 1950, and a Bachelor of Law degree from the Manitoba Law School in 1955. He led an inquiry into labour negotiations into the glass industry, and subsequently served as chair of the Manitoba Labour Board for seven years. He was also a member of the Manitoba Development Corporation board. Once a member of the Liberal Party, he later joined the New Democratic Party and served as its provincial president from 1972 to 1974. Political career MacKay was the New Democratic Party's candidate for the division of Wolseley in the 1973 provincial election. On election night, official results showed that he had received the same number of votes as Liberal Party leader Izzy Asper. Jim Maloway, the returning officer, cast a tiebreaking vote for MacKay and declared him as the elected member; a subsequent recount, however, determined that Asper actually won by four votes. Herb Schulz's memoirs indicate that MacKay would have been appointed as Justice Minister in Edward Schreyer's government, had he been elected.Herb Schulz, A View From The Ledge, Manitoba: Heartland Associates Inc., 2005, p 216. Asper resigned his seat in 1975, and MacKay contested a by-election to replace him. He finished third against Progressive Conservative candidate Robert Wilson in a close three-way contest. He contested Wolseley for a third time in the 1977 provincial election, and lost to Wilson by only 74 votes. MacKay was a founding member of the Progressive Party, which was created by former NDP cabinet minister Sidney Green in 1981. He again sought election in Wolseley in the 1981 provincial election, and was resoundingly defeated. After politics MacKay was also part-owner of Superior Cheese Canada Ltd. in the 1980s. He initially supported a union shop for the plant, but later announced that he had \\"second thoughts\\" and argued for an open shop structure.\\"Ex-head of board questions union at his cheese plant\\", Globe and Mail, 30 September 1981, P11. In 1996, he argued that Manitoba should abandon the Rand formula of mandatory dues collection and allow workers to opt out of union membership. Peter Olfert, president of the Manitoba Government Employees' Association, described this suggestion as regressive.John Collison, \\"Province's labour laws cause strikes, lawyer says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 August 1996, A9.

It was a scaled-up version of the CASA C-202 Halc√≥n and was designed for the domestic civil market. The C-207 received no civil orders, but the Spanish Air Force ordered ten. The first model, designated T.7A entered service in 1960. Ten more aircraft were ordered and configured for paratroop or cargo transport, designated CASA 207C(T.7B). The CASA 207 was one of the first aircraft to be designed by CASA in order to replace the transports in current service at the time, like the CASA 2.111 (Heinkel He 111) and the CASA 352 (Junkers Ju 52). The two prototypes and 20 production aircraft served in the military until the early 1980s. Additionally, most of the aircraft were delivered to the 35th Transport wing. Development The CASA 207 was developed as an airline-suited aircraft, for the short- to mid- range routes that were common in Spain and Europe. The Azor was deemed to be obsolete and uneconomical for its time and standards, for which better aircraft were available for its role. So, CASA turned its marketing attention to the Spanish Air Force, which had interest in a \\"modern\\" transport aircraft. CASA Had previously experimented with transport aircraft to replace types already in service, such as the CASA C-201 and CASA C-202. They were plagued with underpowered engines and were cancelled. CASA decided to make a version of the 207 for the Spanish Air Force that would follow up to the C-201 and 202. The CASA 207A was built for the Air Force with a capacity of 40 passengers plus a crew of four. A batch of ten C-207C (or T.7B) were built with large doors and capacity for 37 Paratroopers.

The best known species, D. terrelli, is famous as the \\"world's first vertebrate apex predator,\\" and is estimated to be up to in length: other species, however, such as D. raveri, are estimated to be in length. =Eastmanosteus= Eastmanosteous is a diverse genus of medium to somewhat large predatory arthrodires very similar in anatomy to the species of Dunkleosteus. Eastmanosteus differs from Dunkleosteus in having a unique tubercle-ornamentation on the dermal surfaces of the plates, a distinctively shaped nuchal plate, and sutures that are more zigzagging. The best studied species, E. calliaspis may not be of this genus due to its recently appreciated relationship to the Emsian-aged genus Xiangshuiosteus. =Golshanichthys= Fossils of Golshanichthys are found in Frasnian-aged marine strata near Kerman, Iran. =Kiangyousteus= Kiangyousteus yohii This Middle Devonian genus represents the first arthrodire described from China.

The NAS was responsible for preparing long‚Äìrange analytical assessments of international issues. The foreign intelligence assessment functions of JIO were assumed by the Office of National Assessments (ONA) in 1977 and the JIO was fully replaced by the Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO) in 1990. History Following World War II, defence and foreign intelligence functions were shared between the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force. There also existed a Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB) within the Department of Defence responsible for geographic, infrastructure, economic, scientific and technical intelligence in the Asia-Pacific region.

Background Turkey first applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in July 1959, the EEC having been established in 1958. The EEC responded by suggesting the establishment of an association as an interim measure leading to full accession. This led to negotiations which resulted in the Ankara Agreement on September 12, 1963.Official Journal of the European Communities 1973, C113p2 Agreement The Ankara Agreement was signed on 12 September 1963 in Ankara.Official Journal of the European Communities 1973, C113 p2 The Agreement initiated a three-step process toward creating a customs union to help secure Turkey's full membership in the EEC. Upon creation, the customs union would begin the integration of economic and trade policy, which the EEC considered necessary. An Association Council, set up by the Agreement, controls its development and gives the Agreement detailed effect by making decisions. In 1970, Turkey and the EEC agreed an Additional Protocol to the Agreement.Official Journal 1973, C113, p18 One part of the Agreement was to be financial assistance from the EEC to Turkey, including loans worth 175 million ECU during the period from 1963 to 1970. The results were mixed; EEC trade concessions to Turkey in the form of tariff quotas proved less effective than hoped, but the EEC's share in Turkish imports rose substantially during the period.Duzenli, Esra, \\"Free Movement of Turkish Workers in the Context of Turkey's Accession to the EU,\\" Middle East Technical University, < The Agreement sought the free circulation of workers, establishment and services, including virtually total harmonisation with EEC policies relating to the internal market. However, it excluded Turkey from political positions and precluded its recourse to the European Court of Justice for dispute resolution to some extent.Duzenli, Esra, \\"Free Movement of Turkish Workers in the Context of Turkey's Accession to the EU,\\" Middle East Technical University, < With the European Union replacing the EEC with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Ankara Agreement now governs relations between Turkey and the EU. =Individual rights= The Agreement, its Additional Protocol and Decisions of the Association Council are part of EEC law. The European Court of Justice has decided that these give specific rights to Turkish nationals and businesses that the EEC Member States are required by EEC law to respect.

He fought in the War of 1812 and was Attorney General of Michigan Territory.  Biography  = Early life = Charles Larned was a native of Pittsfield in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. He was the son of Berkshire County Sheriff Simon Larned, who was born in Connecticut and, during the American Revolutionary War, was Colonel of the 9th Regiment United States Infantry, and aide-de-camp to General Washington. Larned graduated from Williams College in 1806 and then studied law in Kentucky in the offices of Henry Clay. = Military career = During the War of 1812, while Larned was dining with a group of prominent citizens in Shelby County, Kentucky, word came to the group from Governor Isaac Shelby that General William Henry Harrison was in danger of being overwhelmed by British General Henry Procter and his Indian allies. One of the group, Colonel Owen, undertook the organization of a regiment, including Larned and commanded by Governor Shelby himself, to reinforce Harrison's troops. Many of the regiment were slaughtered by the Indians after surrendering to the British, in an event known as the River Raisin Massacre. Larned himself survived and soon rose to the rank of major, and later participated with the regiment in the Battle of the Thames. While stationed in Detroit, Larned, along with eighty others (including General Lewis Cass) learned of General William Hull's plan to surrender Detroit to the British without a fight. The men signed a document, found among Larned's personal papers, agreeing to seize Hull and depose him in order to prevent the surrender. Hull learned of the plan and instead sent Larned and many of the others south to Ohio to meet a supply convoy. While returning to Detroit, they received word that Hull had surrendered and they were to become prisoners of the British. = Practicing law in Detroit = After the war, Larned began practicing law in Detroit, and served as Attorney General of Michigan Territory during the Black Hawk War, under Territorial Governor George B. Porter. In 1813 he married Sylvia Easton Colt. He served on the Board of Trustees of the University of Michigan from 1821 until his death. He survived the cholera epidemic that swept Detroit in 1832. When cholera returned in 1834, Larned worked to alleviate the suffering of others, at one point going without sleep for 48 hours straight. In the end, he succumbed to it and died August 13, 1834. Charles C. Trowbridge, Mayor of Detroit paid tribute to him, saying he left \\"a family, a city, and a State in mourning.\\" He was buried in Elmwood Cemetery. His wife died August 24, 1845.

Often described as a financial sponsor, each firm will raise funds that will be invested in accordance with one or more specific investment strategies. Typically, a private equity firm will raise pools of capital, or private equity funds that supply the equity contributions for these transactions. Private equity firms will receive a periodic management fee as well as a share in the profits earned (carried interest) from each private equity fund managed. Private equity firms, with their investors, will acquire a controlling or substantial minority position in a company and then look to maximize the value of that investment. Private equity firms generally receive a return on their investments through one of the following avenues: * an initial public offering (IPO) ‚Äî shares of the company are offered to the public, typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares; * a merger or acquisition ‚Äî the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company; * a recapitalization ‚Äî cash is distributed to the shareholders (in this case the financial sponsor) and its private equity funds either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution. Private equity firms characteristically make longer- hold investments in target industry sectors or specific investment areas where they have expertise. Private equity firms and investment funds should not be confused with hedge fund firms which typically make shorter-term investments in securities and other more liquid assets within an industry sector but with less direct influence or control over the operations of a specific company. Where private equity firms take on operational roles to manage risks and achieve growth through long term investments, hedge funds more frequently act as short-term traders of securities betting on both the up and down sides of a business or of an industry sector's financial health. A primer: Hedge funds, private equity & venture capital, USA Today, August 17, 2007. Ranking private equity firms According to an updated 2008 ranking created by industry magazine Private Equity InternationalTop 50 PE funds from Private equity international (The PEI 50), the largest private equity firms include The Carlyle Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Goldman Sachs Principal Investment Group, The Blackstone Group, Bain Capital, Sycamore Partners and TPG Capital. These firms are typically direct investors in companies rather than investors in the private equity asset class and for the most part the largest private equity investment firms focused primarily on leveraged buyouts rather than venture capital. Preqin ltd (formerly known as Private Equity Intelligence), an independent data provider, provides a ranking of the 25 largest private equity investment managers. Among the largest firms in that ranking were AlpInvest Partners, Ardian (formerly AXA Private Equity), AIG Investments, Goldman Sachs Private Equity Group, and Pantheon Ventures. Because private equity firms are continuously in the process of raising, investing, and distributing their private equity funds, capital raised can often be the easiest to measure. Other metrics can include the total value of companies purchased by a firm or an estimate of the size of a firm's active portfolio plus capital available for new investments. As with any list that focuses on size, the list does not provide any indication as to relative investment performance of these funds or managers.

The shopping center was inaugurated on August 11, 1978, and flourished for three decades, containing 249 stores during its heyday as the largest and highest-grossing mall in Tennessee. Many factors led to its decline during the late 2000s, plummeting to a mere 12 retailers by the year 2012 and thus considered a dead mall. Between 2012 and 2016, over $50 million has been invested in revitalizing the Hickory Hollow property and 58 tenants now occupy the internationally themed mall (47.8% occupancy) as of 2016. History Antioch was a small rural community of farmers in the 1960s. A massive population influx in the 1970s was fueled by the construction of numerous apartment complexes after the sewer system was extended to the outskirts of Nashville. Hickory Hollow Mall opened on August 11, 1978, on 27 acres of land in Nashville's burgeoning southeastern neighborhood amidst the explosive growth. It was Middle Tennessee's fifth mall, its second super regional mall, and one of Tennessee's first two-tiered indoor shopping centers. For its first three years, it was the largest retail space in the state of Tennessee, surpassing Goodlettsville's Rivergate Mall, which opened in 1971. The mall's structure featured three wings in a T-shaped layout connected by a large two- story atrium hub, containing a total of 137 tenants, including an arcade and a movie theater. On opening night, Mall Cinemas 1-2-3 operated by Consolidated Theatres featured newly released movies on all three screens including Animal House at 7:00 p.m., Grease at 7:15 p.m., and Hooper at 7:30 p.m. Local department store, Cain-Sloan, opened on August 9, two days prior to the mall's inauguration, and was situated on the south side of the central hub (as the south wing did not yet exist). Two other department stores served as the original anchor tenants, including national franchise Sears in the west wing, and locally founded Castner Knott in the east wing. Big-name retailers occupying the inner core of the building included national chains B. Dalton Booksellers, The Gap, Kay Jewelers, Thom McAn, and Hallmark Cards. Original tenants also included locally based Kirkland's, The Tennessee Coffee Company, and the initial location of Angelo's Picnic Pizza. Natural light was abundant through the atrium-style glass ceiling and steel latticework and the mall's center court included a glass elevator and a water feature. The Food Garden, a food court located in the west wing, was designed with multi-level seating and landscaped vegetation with eateries that included locally based The Cookie Store, as well as Swensen's Ice Cream Factory, Tater Junction, and the first Chick-fil-A in Tennessee; one of the first expansions of this franchise outside of Georgia and The Carolinas. The premises contained 5,795 parking spaces. At some point the main office obtained the phone number (615) 731-MALL. On October 7, 1981, the Mall of Memphis opened in West Tennessee with of retail space, surpassing Hickory Hollow in retail square footage but not in overall structural size. On August 5, 1987, the $180 million facility Hamilton Place opened in Chattanooga with an overall size of , surpassing the Mall of Memphis as the largest in Tennessee. That structure held the title until 1998 when West Town Mall in Knoxville completed an expansion. Expansion and renovation In 1982, the J.C. Penney Company department store was added to anchor the north wing along with 24 stores in a $10 million expansion project. Cain-Sloan was sold to national chain Dillard's in 1987, occupying the space for the next four years, while the mall theater was acquired Carmike Cinemas in July 1989. In 1991, a $25 million expansion converted Dillard's into 30 smaller shops while a new Dillard's and parking garage were constructed in what was previously parking lot space. On September 20, 1991, the non-profit company Hickory Hollow Mall Merchants Association, established on opening day in 1978, was dissolved. The food court was expanded in 1993 as Hickory Hollow remained competitive despite the opening of five new malls in the Nashville area. On April 25, 1997, Carmike Cinemas opened the Hickory 8 in the east parking lot leading to the closure of the mall's original theater shortly thereafter. In 1998, Castner Knott's 100-year history came to an end when they were acquired by Dillard's, the anchor of the east wing undergoing a constant metamorphosis over the next seven years. In Nashville, all five of Castner-Knott's high-volume mall locations were within shopping complexes that already contained Dillard's. To avoid antitrust violations, those spaces were sold to Saks Incorporated and rebranded as Proffitt's including the Hickory Hollow location which was then extensively remodeled. In 2001, Proffitt's was sold to The May Company and all stores were converted to Hecht's. Founded in 1877, The May Company was bought out by Federated Department Stores in 2005 and their Hecht's locations became Macy's. CBL & Associates, the real estate investment trust that manages Chattanooga's Hamilton Place, bought Hickory Hollow Mall for nearly $200 million in the summer of 1998. By the year 2000 roughly 702,000 inhabitants resided in the mall's primary trade area (20-mile radius) and secondary trade area (40-mile radius), a number that would swell to nearly one million by 2015. To compete with the city's newer malls, more renovations took place in 2002 and 2003 adding a children's play area and a revamped food court along with new carpeting, updated fixtures, and architecturally enhanced entrances. Decline By 2005 Hickory Hollow Mall's appraisal value had slipped to $70 million. After enjoying a relatively low vacancy rate throughout its existence, 2006 would prove to be a pivotal year in the mall's history. Numerous dynamics during the mid-2000s caused the shopping center to become a victim of Suburban Retail Decline. Contributing factors included drastic changes in community demographics, a sharp increase in Antioch's violent crime rate, and several well-publicized shootings on mall property within a relatively short span of time. Subsequent dwindling mall traffic, competition from more modern shopping venues, and the untimely economic struggles of several large retailers dealt a crushing blow to the mall. The earliest recorded shooting in the immediate mall vicinity occurred on November 3, 2004. Brian Schweitzer was fatally shot outside the U.S. Courthouse Credit Union bank on the east side of the mall by Metro Police officer Shawn Taylor. Schweitzer, himself a former policeman, had robbed two other banks that morning and attempted to flee when officer Taylor identified the suspect outside the Antioch bank and fired. Taylor was the same officer who arrested Tennessee Titans star quarterback Steve McNair the previous year on May 22, 2003 for DUI. The population of the 37013 ZIP code rose dramatically from 2000 to 2010, increasing from 51,343 to 78,406. While the state's population had grown by 13.4%, the Antioch vicinity had experience a 68.01% growth rate. With the population explosion came major demographic changes, whites accounting for a mere 16.8% of the increase. The black population nearly doubled and the Hispanic population increased by 35.2%, causing the white population to drop below 50% for the first time in the town's history. By 2006, the median household income had plummeted from $46,063 to $36,170 and the violent crime rate had surpassed the national average for the first time. The rate of property crimes had escalated to four times the national average and within a few years the murder rate had soared to over three times the national average. With the opening of Opry Mills on May 12, 2000, patrons on the east side of Nashville now had a flashy modern shopping destination. To the south, Stones River Mall in Murfreesboro completed major renovations between 2006 and 2008, while in October 2007, The Avenue Murfreesboro, a large outdoor shopping area, opened in a rapidly growing area just six exits south of Hickory Hollow. In early 2006 JCPenney became the first anchor to depart the mall, ending its 24-year presence in the north wing, and reopened on March 1st in Mt. Juliet's new Providence Marketplace in the eastern suburbs of Nashville. In their absence, mall occupancy had fallen from 91% (2003) to 82% (2006) when the JCPenney space was acquired by Steve & Barry's University Sportswear in May 2006. Antioch's Starwood Amphitheatre closed on October 21, 2006 after 20 years as a legendary concert venue in Middle Tennessee. In 2008, Hickory Hollow would lose three of its largest tenants. Dillard's began liquidating its inventory in May and closed on August 2, initiating the mass exodus of smaller stores. That same year, Linens ‚Äòn Things closed all national stores to exclusively operate online, while Steve & Barry's announced their bankruptcy on November 20, 2008 and closed in early 2009. By that time, large stores outside the mall had also closed their doors, including Circuit City, closing all locations nationally, as well as Toys \\"R\\" Us, Pier 1 Imports, Michaels, and Office Depot. At the end of 2009, store occupancy had fallen below 70%, and Hickory Hollow was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's 10 most endangered malls. Sales dropped to $187 per square foot of retail space, under 45% of the national average of $420, and the value of the mall was severely downgraded to $12.6 million. By early 2010, the north and south wings were practically vacant, while the food court lost vital franchises Subway on January 3 and Chick-fil-A on January 8. Major tenants The Children's Place, Hot Topic, New York & Company, and Lane Bryant announced they would vacate the mall by January 23, citing poor sales since the departure of Dillard's and JCPenney. Meanwhile, the east and west wings, respectively flanked by Macy's and Sears, remained heavily occupied by such notable franchises as A√©ropostale, Charlotte Russe, Wet Seal, Bath & Body Works, Electronic Express, and Buckle. The Hickory Hollow Action Partnership began meetings on March 9, 2010, formed under chairman Ben Freeland, owner of nearby Freeland Chevrolet Superstore, with the hope of changing the community's negative perception. News coverage of several violent acts that occurred on mall property influenced the perception of a lack of safety at Hickory Hollow Mall. On May 11, 2010 around 9:00 p.m., 18-year old Marcus Caruthers robbed two shoppers at gunpoint, taking their purchases along with their wallets and cell phones. On November 18, 2011 around 9:20 p.m., a mall patron was shot in the leg during an armed robbery attempt in the mall parking lot outside of Sears. On January 20, 2012 around 8:00 p.m., two gunmen approached a woman outside the south end of the mall and ordered her into a vehicle demanding cash. Four male friends approached the vehicle in her defense when one of them was shot in the shoulder. On December 27, 2011, CEO Louis D'Ambrosio announced the struggling Sears franchise would close 100 to 120 nationwide locations. Two days later, the Sears that had anchored the west wing since the mall's opening in 1978 learned they would be one of those closures. Six days after that, on January 4, 2012, CEO Terry J. Lundgren announced that Macy's intended to close five locations nationwide that no longer met their performance standards, including their Hickory Hollow store. By mid-March 2012, Sears had closed in the west wing and Macy's had vacated the east wing, leaving the mall with no department stores. In April 2012, it was announced that the final big box tenant around the mall would be departing as Best Buy closed 50 stores nationwide, part of the company's plan to eliminate its underperforming stores. The Hickory Hollow location was shuttered on May 12. With only 83 stores remaining on Hickory Hollow's directory, CBL & Associates vice president Katie Reinsmidt announced on June 1, 2012 that the company was terminating the leases of all but 12 stores in an effort to reinvent itself. The remaining tenants were given 30 to 60 days to vacate the mall, with the rest closing by July 31. Reinsmidt stated \\"We are working closely with local officials to explore options that would recreate Hickory Hollow and allow the center to best serve the needs of the community.\\". On the weekend of June 22‚Äì24, 2012, Game Galaxy Arcade hosted the Midwest Championship video game competition, a regional qualifier for the 2012 Evolution Championship Series in Las Vegas. At the competition's conclusion, Game Galaxy Arcade closed on June 24 and relocated on the opposite side of Bell Road, in the strip mall occupied by Best Buy (originally by Hills department store). Game Galaxy has since moved this location to Smyrna, TN. Hickory Hollow's arcade had been a popular attraction since the mall's beginning, opening originally as The Gold Mine, before being occupied by Tilt, and finally by the locally owned, retro video gaming Game Galaxy Arcade. On November 7, 2012, Target, located just on the opposite side of I-24 (around 1 mile from the mall), announced that it would close its 31-year old Hickory Hollow area store on February 2, 2013 due to poor financial performance. On June 17, 2013, WKRN reported that within a one-mile radius of the mall, there had been 422 crimes reported over the past year in contrast to 399 around Rivergate Mall and 202 around Opry Mills. Revitalization projects During the summer of 2012, CBL & Associates announced a multimillion-dollar plan to revitalize Hickory Hollow Mall in conjunction with the Nashville Board of Parks and Recreation, the Metro Arts Commission, and the Nashville Public Library. Nashville Mayor Karl Dean was active in the effort to transform the struggling mall into a mixed-use facility. Nashville State Community College purchased the former Dillard's space for around $3 million and spent another $12.5 million converting it into a satellite campus, debuting its first classes on August 25, 2012. In late October 2012, real estate investor Rajesh Aggarwal and his wife Dr. Reita Aggarwal, a doctor of internal medicine in nearby Murfreesboro, offered to purchase a small space in the mall for $1 million with the intention of starting a medical clinic. Instead, the Aggarwals were offered the entire inner portion of the mall for $1 million by owners CBL & Associates (not including former department store spaces and the vacant Electronic Express location) and the couple made the purchase under the name Global Mall Partnership. Securing lease agreements with 60 new proprietors reflecting the diversity of Antioch, especially Middle Eastern and Latino business owners, the Aggarwals made plans to fill the first level with American franchises and the second level with international retail stores by late 2012 and early 2013. They announced on January 8, 2013 that the facility would be renamed Global Mall at The Crossings. The grand re-opening was held on May 18, 2013, rebranded as Tennessee's first international mall with 20 restaurants and retailers and plans to expand to 80 tenants by mid-summer. In December 2013, Brentwood businessman Charles Jones bought the former Macy's space for $1.6 million, converting the converted the space into a venue for trade shows, corporate meetings, and weddings. On October 9, 2013, Nashville's Metropolitan Sports Authority and the Nashville Predators professional hockey franchise broke ground for a $14 million facility containing dual NHL-sized ice rinks on the north side of the mall just outside the former JCPenney location. Becoming the Nashville area's third dual ice rink, The Ford Ice Center opened on August 19, 2014 to high school hockey team practices and public ice skating sessions. The official grand opening took place September 12 in conjunction with the Nashville Predators Rookie Tournament, while the team's AHL affiliate the Milwaukee Admirals held their September pre-season training camp there. As part of the Nashville Predators‚Äô initiative to spread hockey throughout Middle Tennessee, the team will host hockey camps at the facility but will rarely practice here, remaining at the Centennial Sportsplex. The rink will however host the Vanderbilt club hockey team, the Junior Preds organization, and many local high school hockey games. Olympic gold medalist and NBC figure skating announcer Scott Hamilton, a Middle Tennessee resident, operates his skating academy at the facility with assistance from former Olympian Bill Fauver. The building features a pro shop for hockey equipment and a restaurant-style concession stand. On January 15, 2015, the Nashville Predators held their first practice at the Ford Ice Center open to the public from 11:00 a.m. to noon. In mid-October 2014, the Aggarwals listed the building for sale. Represented by the real estate firm CBRE, both tenants and a potential buyer were being sought with prospects of a charter school, call center, medical facilities, and large anchor retailers occupying the inner core of the mall. On October 17, 2014 the Nashville Global Market, a massive international grocery store, opened in the space formerly occupied by Foot Locker and Lerner New York bringing the mall's occupancy up to 30%. The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County purchased the old J.C. Penney building, opening the Southeast Branch of the Nashville Public Library and Southeast Community Center on October 21, 2014. Featuring an NBA-sized basketball court and a youth basketball partnership with the Memphis Grizzlies, it is the largest rec center in Nashville at . The new library encompasses , doubling the size of the previous neighborhood library, and the value of both complexes and the adjacent Southeast Davison Complex Park is roughly $15 million. On November 17, 2014, plans were finalized by developer Oldacre McDonald for a massive 300-acre shopping center and residential complex at the Hickory Hollow Parkway exit on the opposite side of I-24, but to date that development has not begun. By the end of 2014, only 25% of the mall's retail space was occupied. In 2015, Metro Council District 32 Councilwoman Jacobia Dowell, who represents the district in which the Global Mall is located, addressed the negative perception of Antioch crime. She explained that crime incidents occurring in the general Southeast Nashville vicinity are often mistakenly associated with Antioch. Movie theater attack At 1:15 p.m. on August 5, 2015, 29-year old Vincente David Montano entered the Carmike Hickory 8 movie theater (now the AMC CLASSIC Antioch 8), just outside the east wing of the mall, carrying two backpacks and armed with a hatchet and a pellet gun. He unleashed copious amounts of pepper spray inside a theater where eight people were viewing Mad Max: Fury Road. Montano was shot dead by a SWAT team officer as he tried to escape. Current status There are 58 current tenants and 7 rental spaces among the 136 available retail units. There are seven restaurants operating with an average health score of 98 according to 2015 inspection data. The mall serves as headquarters for the Spanish radio station El Jefe 96.7 FM (alternatively WMGC 810 AM) and for the Spanish newspaper El Crucero. Original mall hours for Hickory Hollow were 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 12:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Sunday. Now, the Global Mall is closed on Mondays with hours of operation being 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 6:00 p.m. Sunday. Retailers are now exclusively influenced by Hispanic, African, and Middle Eastern cultures reflecting the demographics of Southeast Nashville. Target temporarily expressed interest in the former Sears location, the last big-box anchor unsold at the mall, but later backed out. In March 2016, Brentwood-based real estate firm Crestview Resources (owner of the headquarters of Brookdale Senior Living) finally purchased the property, including 17 acres of surrounding space, from Sears Roebuck and Co. for $5 million. On July 6, 2016, the Bridgestone tire company headquartered in Nashville announced plans to relocate its IT and customer service centers to the upper floor of the former Sears space. On April 23, 2019, local television news station WKRN reported that tenants were being told by mall management to leave and that demolition plans were \\"in the works\\". Additionally, the previous month, there were numerous codes violations found within and around the building, some dangerous. On June 10, 2019, the Tennessean newspaper reported that local Antioch business owner and investor Ben Freeland, of Freeland Chevrolet in Hickory Hollow, was under contract to purchase the mall from the Aggarwals. He proposed various ideas for redevelopment, but expressed that it would not contain retail space. To date, the only remaining farm in Antioch is the 156-acre Hurt family property where Angus cattle are raised.

It is one of the few companies offering 53-foot containers, which offer up to 40% more cubic capacity than other container sizes. History Trailer Bridge was founded in 1991 by Malcom McLean, who is recognized in the industry as \\"The Father of Containerization\\". McLean had previously started McLean Trucking Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which he built into one of the largest trucking companies in the United States. He saw the need for a service that could, in the words of the company, provide \\"true single-carrier responsibility across the United States and on to Puerto Rico\\".Company profile In April 1991, McLean founded Trailer Bridge, and in the following February, Trailer Bridge made its first shipment from Jacksonville, Florida, to San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1997, Trailer Bridge went public on NASDAQ and moved its headquarters to Jacksonville. Over the years, it expanded its fleet and capacity, and in 2000, it unveiled its shipment tracking tool. In 2004, Trailer Bridge purchased all of Kadampanattu Corporation's stock, thus gaining two 736-foot, triple-deck, ro/ro barges. In 2010, Trailer began offering weekly service to and from Jacksonville and Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. During the 4th quarter of 2011, the company had notes totaling $82.5 million come due. Unable to meet this obligation, they filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In the first quarter of 2012, a judge approved their reorganization plan which effectively gave Seacor Holdings control of the company with three of seven directors on the Trailer Bridge board. A press release from Trailer Bridge stated that Seacor Holdings ‚Äúintends to use its extensive maritime transportation experience to assist the company in implementing its strategy to return it to sustainable and profitable operations.‚Äù Seacor Holdings did not comment, but a Credit Suisse analyst stated, ‚ÄúDistressed acquisition opportunities [are the company‚Äôs] bread and butter. Management does not like losses; therefore, we do not expect Seacor to hold onto businesses not generating their cost of capital.‚Äù In 2012, Trailer Bridge celebrated the 20th anniversary of its inaugural voyage and five years of service to Puerto Plata, DR, and also reached its one millionth customer booking, established TB Logistics, and added more containers, making it one of the world's largest fleets. Trailer Bridge was recognized in 2016 as one of Jacksonville's best places to work by the Jacksonville Business Journal. Operations Trailer Bridge is a U.S. flag (Jones Act) transportation provider and carrier offering cargo shipping, vessel chartering, barge chartering, and vehicle shipping services between Jacksonville, Florida, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic on a weekly basis. The company's logistics management services include Less than truckload shipping, truckload, and intermodal services through its third party logistics unit. Its fleet of 53-foot by 102-inch containers offers about 40% more capacity compared to other containers and their 3,860 cubic feet translates to more value for customers. Trailer Bridge also offers car shipping to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Customers can use Trailer Bridge's AutoBridge service to get instant quote for shipping a car to Puerto Rico from Florida and more. And with TB Quick Track, customers can easily track their shipments. Trailers destined for Puerto Rico are picked up almost anywhere in the continental U.S. and driven to Jacksonville, where they are loaded onto a barge for the five-day trip to San Juan. In 2007, the company added the Dominican Republic as a shipping destination and is, according to The Jacksonville Business Journal, the only service \\"between the U.S. and the Dominican Republic using U.S.-flagged ships.\\"Jacksonville Business Journal: August 13, 2007-Trailer Bridge starts Dominican service The company expects to service Cuba when the US permits it.

The serotype is determined by the antibody recognition of Œ±1 subset of HLA-A Œ±-chains. For A1, the alpha \\"A\\" chain are encoded by the HLA-A allele group and the Œ≤-chain are encoded by B2M locus. This group currently is dominated by A*0101. A1 and A are almost synonymous in meaning. A1 is more common in Europe than elsewhere, it is part of a long haplotype that appears to have been frequent in the ancient peoples of Northwestern Europe. A1 is a frequent component of the AH8.1 haplotype. A1 serotype positivity is roughly linked to a large number of inflammatory diseases and conditions believed to have immune system involvement. Because of its linkage within the AH8.1 haplotype many studies showed association with A1 or A1,B8 only later to show the association drift toward the class II region gene alleles, DR3 and DQ2.5. While it is not clear what role A1 has in infectious disease, some linkage with infection rates in HIV remain associated within the A1 region of the haplotype. Serotype In all instances so far, HLA-A1 has been found to be linked to disease by association, but there are few that define HLA-A1 has a predominant genetic risk relative to other gene-alleles in the vicinity of the A1 gene on the larger haplotype. =A1 and autoimmune diseases= A1 serotype was associated with a number of diseases as \\"HL-A\\"' antigens were first being described. The associations rapidly expanded to include 'HL-A8' HLA-B8, as the HLA A1 and B8 were found to be commonly linked. As DRw3 was characterized, autoimmune risk drifted toward the class II region. A1-B58 haplotype (A1-B17 where B58 is dominant) may remain associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) A1 in diabetes With the exception of type 1 diabetes, most of the evidence for direct association of A1 with autoimmune diseases evaporated as DR3 and DQ2 genes were characterized. While type 1 diabetes shows an extended association on the HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype, the association appears not to extend beyond the HLA-B locus. A recent study of DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 phenotype found that A1-cw7-B8 was actually lower than expected relative to other A-B types, indicating that risk associated genes are located between B8 and DR3. However a study elsewhere showed that A*0101 appears to alter risk for type 1 diabetes but not Cw7-B8. The type 1 diabetes example shows the inherent difficulty in the use of linkage analysis alone to cipher risk. =A1 and allergic disease, sensitivities= Early in the study of HLA an association was found between HL A1,B8 in allergic disease, these are found to link to extended HLA A1-B8 region. Oddly, A1 was also found associated with methotrexate-induced liver cirrhosis. Whereas A1 was found negatively associated with other disease such as coal workers pneumoconiosis and leprosy. =A1 and infectious disease= Within the early studies, A1 was found associate with or protected against some infectious diseases. Some diseases found associated with A1 actually link to the extended A1-B8 haplotype, viral induced hepatitis and accelerated progression of HIV are examples. A1 with B8 showed an increase risk of measles infection, however, the significance was not consistent. A more recent paper showed an association of A*0101 with lower than average responses to measles vaccine. With rubella, A1-B8 was more frequently found in people infected as a result of maternal transefance. A1 was also found to associate with circumoral herpes. An association between A1 and cold sores was also described. Subsequently, the association for herpes simplex was also shown. =A1 in Lymphoma= In Hodgkin's lymphoma HLA-A1, but DR3 was not found higher. The A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype has a known association with Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, approximately 70% of patients are homozygotes for DQ2 with at least one copy of DR3-DQ2. Alleles Most of the disease risk conferred by A*0101 are represented by either A1 serotype risks, or A1-B8 serotype risk (In Europe A1-B8 is almost always composed of A*0101 and B*0801). The other alleles, A*0102 and A*0103, may confer specific risks. For example, A*0102 was found linked to a type of stroke seen frequently in children with sickle cell anemia. There is a report that in the Somali communities within the US 2/3 of A1 bearers have the A*0103 isoform. A1-B haplotypes *A1-B8 Western Irish, N.

He received a gold basketball emblematic of his selection on the All-America basketball team appearing in The Sporting News, a national sports newspaper. He played for the Waterloo Hawks (1949‚Äì50), Boston Celtics and Tri-Cities Blackhawks (1950‚Äì51) in the National Basketball Association for a total of 109 games. In his 1948‚Äì49 season for Waterloo, Boykoff's shooting average (41.3%) was the fourth-highest in the league. While playing for the Celtics, he was the highest paid NBA player, at around $15,000 per year. He became so proficient at blocking shots that because of his play, the rules of the game were changed to prevent shots being blocked on their way down toward the basket (goaltending). Personal Even with his outstanding record, Boykoff remained humble. He was quoted as saying: > I'm not an athlete, I'm just a big guy and a lucky one. Later in life Boykoff appeared in films and television shows such as Star Trek, Frasier, Town & Country, The Crew, on McDonald's cups and commercials, and a few others. Boykoff died in California at age 78, a victim of lung cancer.

According to trinitarian Christianity, Jesus Christ is God, so cultural depictions of Jesus in film and television are also portrayals of God.  Religious views on portraying God  Islam and Judaism both prohibit pictorial representations of God. However, television and Hollywood cinema emerged from a largely Christian tradition‚Äîthat whilst it shared the prohibition on idolatry was more relaxed about religious iconography‚Äîand the many cultural depictions of God in that tradition that preceded the invention of television and cinema. Whilst even the humorous portrayals of God are rarely irreverent, portraying God is not without controversy. The animated television series God, the Devil and Bob portrayed God as being a beer- swilling, ex-hippie character who closely resembled The Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia, which raised objections from fundamentalist Christian groups in the United States, causing the show to be pulled from broadcasting in the United States after just 3 episodes (although the entire series was broadcast in the United Kingdom). One of the last films that British activist Mary Whitehouse campaigned against was Irvine Welsh's The Granton Star Cause, which portrayed God as drunken and abusive. Ironically, the campaign backfired, only serving to advertise the film more widely.  Casting and acting the role of God  The role of God is a difficult one to play, and also a difficult one to cast. The casting of Alanis Morissette as God in Dogma was influenced by the singer's own public dialogue with her faith, as expressed in her songs. The casting of African American Morgan Freeman as God in Bruce Almighty took the movie stereotype of a \\"black angel\\" to a new level. On the subject of playing the role, Ella Shohat observes that God is a \\"rare challenge\\" for actors, raising the questions of how a method actor could possibly prepare for the part, and what possible personal feelings or experiences an actor could draw upon in order to portray a character that is omniscient, omnipotent, and the creator of the universe. God has largely been cast as white and male, Freeman and Morrissette being exceptions to this, that line up alongside William Keighley's 1936 film The Green Pastures, where all characters, including God, are played by African American actors (Rex Ingram in the case of what the movie calls \\"De Lawd\\"). The opening prologue of that film included what amounted to a disclaimer, to make the movie palatable to the white audiences in the United States of the time, asserting that: A similarly unusual piece of casting can be found in Lars von Trier's 1996 movie Breaking the Waves, where God is both a woman and identical to the movie's (human) protagonist. Whilst in silent movies, the voice of God was simply an on-screen written caption, in the talkies, God's voice has presented a particular casting challenge, in biblical epics especially, since vocal intonation and accent carry with them implications of class, gender, and race. Although in both the Bible and the Qur'an God speaks, that voice is nowhere described. A filmmaker thus faces a choice about the voice to use, with no scriptural guidance to work from. This conflicts with the filmmaker's perceived task, in the case of biblical epics, of presenting scripture without interpretation or exegesis. In biblical epics and similar movies, God's voice is generally cast to provide a sense of authority. It is deep, resonant, and masculine, and usually the American English of Southern California (sometimes with a touch of British English). One unique approach, used by the movie Switch, was to have God as two voices, one male and one female, speaking simultaneously. Director John Huston provided the voice of God in his 1966 epic The Bible: In the Beginning.  Different portrayals  God has in fact been portrayed in movies ever since the days of silent cinema, in biblical epics, experimental films, everyday dramas, and comedies. A cantankerous animated God instructs King Arthur and his knights with their mission in the 1975 comedy Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Robert Mitchum portrayed a cigar- smoking, American, God in Fr√©d√©ric Fonteyne's 1992 comedy Les Sept p√©ch√©s capitaux. A suicidal supreme being identified as \\"God Killing Himself\\" expires in an act of self-immolation in E. Elias Merhige's 1991 avant-garde feature Begotten. In Carlos Diegues' 2003 movie Deus √© Brasileiro, God is a down-to- Earth character, exhausted from his labours, who is taking a rest in the north east of Brazil. God as a character is often mentioned or intervenes in the plot of the CW show Supernatural. He seems as a loving, smart, serious, strategic, all-seeing, father, that observes events play out, but ignores them unless he absolutely needs to fix something = Oblique portrayals = One new portrayal of God was in the television series Joan of Arcadia. In that series, God is portrayed, in accordance with the programme's theme song (Joan Osborne's \\"One of Us\\"), as simply a proverbial \\"stranger on a bus\\". God is portrayed as taking on human form in a wide variety of shapes, from a piano tuner to a telephone repairman. Neuhaus characterizes this portrayal as an \\"unknowable but visible God, who sees and is seen and is among us always, in all kinds of forms, participating in our everyday life but not interfering with humanity's free will, and who nonetheless calls us into service\\". This portrayal was criticized in the first series for being ecumenical, almost to the point of being secular. The creator of the series, Barbara Hall, set out how God would be portrayed in some directives to the series' writers, named the \\"Ten Commandments of Joan of Arcadia\\". Thus, in the words of Amber Tamblyn, Joan of Arcadia is \\"not religious, we're philosophical\\". Neuhaus deduces that this portrayal of God was in part motivated by the fact that Joan of Arcadia is a television show, a product, that has to appeal to a broad a range of viewers. Thus God, as portrayed in the show, does not call for proselytisation. Similarly, the portrayal of God is prepared to poke fun at Christian doctrine. Further, Joan of Arcadia's God spurns the supernatural. A more oblique portrayal of God occurs in the television series Wonderfalls, where God appears not as a person, but as a series of inanimate objects, that lead the protagonist of the series to perform good works in other people's lives. The word \\"God\\" is never mentioned in the show in relation to these encounters. = Off-screen portrayals = Some portrayals of God are entirely off-screen. For example: The God who gives the stone tablets to Moses in The Ten Commandments is, in the words of Paul Schrader's commentary to the film, \\"off-screen to the right\\". Such biblical epics have less trouble with this obliquity than non-biblical works. This because whilst there is no visual representation of God himself in the source text that such movies are based upon, there are visually representable elements that can be used, from burning bushes to clouds and fire, in the manifestations of God. So whilst biblical epics are constrained by their source text to aniconism, they are not denied spectacle.

Early history CBM began in the mid 1970s with research headed by Stan Deno at the University of Minnesota.Deno, S.L. (1985). Curriculum-based measurement: The emerging alternative. Exceptional Children, 52(3), 219‚Äì32 Over the course of 10 years, this work led to the establishment of measurement systems in reading, writing, and spelling that were: (a) easy to construct, (b) brief in administration and scoring, (c) had technical adequacy (reliability and various types of validity evidence for use in making educational decisions), and (d) provided alternate forms to allow time series data to be collected on student progress.Skinner, Neddenriep, Bradley-Klug & Ziemann (2002) Advances in Curriculum-Based Measurement: Alternative Rate Measures for Assessing Reading Skills in Pre- and Advanced Readers. The Behavior Analyst Today, 3(3), 270‚Äì83 BAO This focus in the three language arts areas eventually was expanded to include mathematics, though the technical research in this area continues to lag that published in the language arts areas. An even later development was the application of CBM to middle- secondary areas: Espin and colleagues at the University of Minnesota developed a line of research addressing vocabulary and comprehension (with the maze) and by Tindal and colleagues at the University of Oregon developed a line of research on concept-based teaching and learning.Espin, C. & Tindal, G. (1998). Curriculum-based measurement for secondary students (pp. 214‚Äì53). In M.R. Shinn (Ed.), Advanced applications of curriculum-based measurement. New York: Guilford Press. Increasing importance Early research on the CBM quickly moved from monitoring student progress to its use in screening, normative decision-making, and finally benchmarking. Indeed, with the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, and its focus on large-scale testing and accountability, CBM has become increasingly important as a form of standardized measurement that is highly related to and relevant for understanding student's progress toward and achievement of state standards. Key feature Probably the key feature of CBM is its accessibility for classroom application and implementation. It was designed to provide an experimental analysis of the effects from interventions, which includes both instruction and curriculum. This is one of the most important conundrums to surface on CBM: To evaluate the effects of a curriculum, a measurement system needs to provide an independent \\"audit\\" and not be biased to only that which is taught. The early struggles in this arena referred to this difference as mastery monitoring (curriculum-based which was embedded in the curriculum and therefore forced the metric to be the number (and rate) of units traversed in learning) versus experimental analysis which relied on metrics like oral reading fluency (words read correctly per minute) and correct word or letter sequences per minute (in writing or spelling), both of which can serve as GOMs. In mathematics, the metric is often digits correct per minute. N.B. The metric of CBM is typically rate-based to focus on \\"automaticity\\" in learning basic skills.Hale, A.D.; Skinner, C.H.; Williams, J.; Hawkins, R.; Neddenriep, C.E. & Dizer, J. (2007). Comparing Comprehension Following Silent and Aloud Reading across Elementary and Secondary Students: Implication for Curriculum- Based Measurement. The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(1), 9‚Äì23. BAO Recent advancements The most recent advancements of CBM have occurred in three areas. First, they have been applied to students with low incidence disabilities. This work is best represented by Zigmond in the Pennsylvania Alternate Assessment and Tindal in the Oregon and Alaska Alternate Assessments. The second advancement is the use of generalizability theory with CBM, best represented by the work of John Hintze, in which the focus is parceling the error term into components of time, grade, setting, task, etc. Finally, Yovanoff, Tindal, and colleagues at the University of Oregon have applied Item Response Theory (IRT) to the development of statistically calibrated equivalent forms in their progress monitoring system.Rachel M. Stewart, Ronald C. Martella, Nancy E. Marchand-Martella and Gregory J. Benner (2005): Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior. JEIBI, 2(3), 115‚Äì24.

The brigade received a lot of publicity for its raid behind the separatist lines allegedly inflicting heavy losses on separatist and Russian forces during the war in Donbass. History The 95th Training Center of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces was created in the early 1990s in Zhytomyr (Korbutovka base) from the 242nd Training Tank Regiment. The 242nd Tank Training Regiment had been part of the 117th Guards Tank Training Division. A second base, Bohunia, was also used for the training center. In 1995, the training center was reorganized into the 95th Separate Airborne Brigade. All of the units except the staff and reconnaissance company moved to Bohunia. The first jumps in the Brigade occurred in 1994. The brigade was also one of the first airmobile units to receive its Battle Flag, on 5 October 1994. Until the spring of 1996 all of the jumps were done from Mi-8 helicopters. By the end of the northern hemisphere summer of 1996 soldiers began jumping from Il-76 transport aircraft. All the jumps were conducted in the region of Smokovka, and in the Brigade's training range, located in the area of the Starokonstantinin road across the Teterev river. Currently, the brigade's drop zone is located near the Singury settlement, from Zhytomyr. The brigade originally had four battalions, one of which was later disbanded. Soldiers from the brigade took part in peacekeeping missions in Lebanon, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, former Yugoslavia, Kosovo, and between 2003 and 2005 in Iraq.Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Official Bulletin In 2000 the brigade was reorganized into an Airmobile Brigade and was subordinated to the 8th Army Corps. Currently, the brigade includes the 13th Separate Airmobile Battalion, which consists of professional soldiers instead of conscripts. The brigade also includes the 2nd Airmobile Battalion which consists of conscripts based in Korbutovka (A-1910). Brigade headquarters and the conscript 1st Airmobile Battalion, specialized, artillery, and logistics units are based in Bohunia (A-0281). In 2014 the 95th Brigade took part in the Siege of Sloviansk and the Kramatorsk standoff during the War in Donbass.More than 30 killed in Odessa blaze as Ukraine violence spreads, Channel NewsAsia (3 May 2014) The number of dead commandos during Kramatorsk increased to seven - SBU, Ukrayinska Pravda (13 May 2014) On May 13, 2014, seven Paratroopers from the unit were killed during an ambush by separatists in Kramatorsk. In August 2014 the brigade conducted a raid behind the separatist lines. The 95th Airmobile Brigade, which had been reinforced with armor assets and attachments, launched a surprise attack on separatist lines, broke through into their rear areas, fought for 450 kilometers, and destroyed or captured numerous Russian tanks and artillery pieces before returning to Ukrainian lines. They operated not as a concentrated brigade but rather split into three company-sized elements on different axes of advance. According to Phillip Karber, it was one of the longest raids in the military history. The unit was deployed to Donetsk Airport on 21 November 2014 as part of a regular rotation of Ukrainian troops stationed in the area.

The huge monument depicts victorious Hussite warriors and Protestants who were forced into exile 200 years after Hus in the wake of the lost Battle of the White Mountain during the Thirty Years' War, and a young mother who symbolises national rebirth. The monument was so large that the sculptor designed and built his own villa and studio where the work could be carried out. It was unveiled in 1915 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Jan Hus' martyrdom. The memorial was designed by Ladislav ≈†aloun and paid for solely by public donations. Born in 1369, Hus became an influential religious thinker, philosopher, and reformer in Prague. He was a key predecessor to the Protestant movement of the sixteenth century. In his works he criticized religious moral decay of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, the Czech patriot Hus believed that mass should be given in the vernacular, or local language, rather than in Latin. He was inspired by the teachings of John Wycliffe. In the following century, Hus was followed by many other reformers - e.g. Martin Luther, John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli. Hus was ultimately condemned by the Council of Constance and burned at the stake in 1415. This led to the Hussite Wars. Symbolism Marian Column in Prague To the people of Bohemia and other regions around Prague, Jan Hus became a symbol of dissidence and a symbol of strength against oppressive regimes. His opposition to church control by the Vatican gave strength to those who opposed control of Czech lands by the Habsburgs in the 19th century, and Hus soon became a symbol of anti-Habsburg rule. He is said to stand arrogantly in the square in defiance of the cathedral before him. In 1918, a Marian Column that had been erected in the square shortly after the Thirty Years' War was demolished in celebration of independence from the Habsburg monarchy. When Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule, sitting at the feet of the Jan Hus memorial became a way of quietly expressing one's opinion and opposition against the Communist rule. The memorial was restored in 2007.Sculptor Ladislav Saloun, radio.cz, 2007, Pavla Hor√°kov√°, retrieved 6 November 2013 Another statue of Jan Hus * Statue in the Union Cemetery in Bohemia, New York .

It is owned by a consortium comprising Transurban, AustralianSuper and Tawreed Investments It has its headquarters at Eight Mile Plains. Ownership  The company began operating in 1980 as the Gateway Bridge Company. On 2 June 2009, the Queensland Government announced the 'Renewing Queensland Plan' that would sell assets to raise $15 billion, and avoid a further $12 billion required in future capital investment. Queensland Motorways was included in this process. In 2011, the Queensland Government transferred ownership of Queensland Motorways to the Queensland Government‚Äôs Defined Benefit Fund (a superannuation scheme for Queensland public servants) managed by the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC). Queensland Motorways now operates under a 40‚Äìyear Road Franchise Agreement with the state. This transfer set out that the Queensland Government would continue to own the road and bridge infrastructure on the Gateway and Logan Motorways, while QIC would own the QML business and the right to toll the motorways. It also limited toll increases to not exceed CPI increases. On 12 December 2013, QIC announced that Queensland Motorways, with an estimated value of more than $5 billion, would be auctioned off. It was claimed that a change of ownership would not have any impact on existing tolls. Indicative bids will be made by the end of January, and then shortlisted bidders will then be requested submit binding bids, with the process scheduled for completion in April 2014. On 2 July 2014 a consortium comprising Transurban, AustralianSuper and Tawreed Investments completed financial close on the acquisition of Queensland Motorways for $7 billion.Queensland Motorways seels for $7 billion to private consortium ABC News 25 April 2014 In late January 2015 the Queensland Motorways corporate brand was replaced by the Transurban brand and logo. Tolling system Queensland Motorways launched its toll payment brand, go via (now known as Linkt) in 2009 to support the introduction of a non-stop, electronic tolling system on its toll road network and on other Australian toll roads. Vehicles are detected as they travel through a toll point and tolled in two ways. Firstly, with an in-vehicle tag device. Alternatively with video sensors identify the vehicle and registration plate number as it passes through a toll point. Motorists have three days to pay their tolls. If tolls are not paid within that time, offending motorists will receive toll notices, which will include an administration fee, in addition to the toll charge. If payment is still not made upon receipt of the toll notice, a motorist may be issued with a Penalty Infringement Notice. Acquisitions In December 2013 Queensland Motorways acquired the rights to manage and toll the CLEM7 tunnel in a $618 million deal with RiverCity Motorway's receivers.http://www.qldmotorways.com.au/media/News.aspx?NewsCode=503 See also *Road transport in Brisbane References External links *go via - go via website. *go via network - go via network website.

Opened in 1990 as Bellevue Mall, it had capacity for over 90 stores on two floors totaling . The mall itself opened in 1990, began showing signs of decline during the early 2000s recession, and closed in 2008, however two anchor tenants continued to operate beyond the mall's closing. The building was demolished in 2015, and construction began on renovating the property in the 2010s. History The first plans for Bellevue Mall were announced in 1971, when Nashville, Tennessee-based real estate developer Roy Shainberg submitted approval plans for a mall to the city of Nashville's planning and zoning commission on behalf of Cleveland, Ohio-based developer M. H. Hausman Co. The original plans called for a mall to be built on U.S. Route 70S between Interstate 40 and Sawyer Brown Road in the city of Bellevue. Construction was to begin in 1973 and would consist of two phases, with the first to be completed in 1975 and the second in 1977. The first phase would consist of of retail space with three anchor stores; the second phase would consist of of additional shop space and space for up to two more department stores. The design of the mall would include marble flooring and fountains, and it would consist of two levels connected by escalators. The Cleveland, Ohio-based firm of William Dorsky and Associates would be the mall's architect. A newly built road would encircle the mall in order to address concerns from local residents over increased traffic, while a \\"buffer zone\\" of shrubbery and trees would make its design \\"harmonious\\" with the rest of the community. Also planned for the mall's periphery were a supermarket facing U.S. Route 70S, a 200-room hotel, and a business park facing Interstate 40. Overall building costs were estimated at $50 million, and it would be the largest mall in the state of Tennessee upon completion. By March 1974, Shainberg had announced that Nashville-based real estate company Belz Enterprises and department store chain J. C. Penney would be co-developing the mall, with the latter also serving as one of the anchor stores. According to The Tennessean, both companies had agreed to join in the development after M. H. Hausman had begun to undergo negotiations with prospective tenants, since J. C. Penney had just begun a real estate development division and Shainberg had previously handled land acquisition and leasing for Belz's 100 Oaks Mall, also in Nashville. In 1978, Taubman Centers announced that it had replaced J. C. Penney as co-developer, but that the latter would still be building a store in the mall. The planning and zoning commission approved Taubman's conceptual site plan for the mall in late 1978, under which the mall would begin construction in early 1979 and open in 1981. In addition to all of the features conceptualized by M. H. Hausman, Taubman's plans also called for carpeted seating areas, planters, skylights, and modern sculptures commissioned specifically for the mall. Construction was further delayed due to difficulty in finding suitable anchor stores and tenants, along with delays in rezoning the property for commercial use, and road improvements along Interstate 40 and U.S. Route 70S. By late 1987, Taubman had also confirmed that Castner Knott and Dillard's had signed on as two of the mall's anchor stores. =1990s= Bellevue Center originally opened on August 9, 1990 with Castner Knott and Dillard's situated at the far ends of the trident-shaped mall. Spaces for two other anchors were included in the design. One of these (the one closest to Dillard's) was delegated for Nashville's first Macy's store, but the project was canceled and nothing was ever built on the site. Macy's eventually came to the mall in the former Castner Knott location after a series of acquisitions (first Castner Knott to Proffitt's, later Hecht's before Macy's in 2006). Other tenants included KB Toys, Limited Too, Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., and Electronic Express. Bellevue Center's upscale offerings showed initial promise, but foot traffic at the mall began to decline soon after, with competition from the Mall at Green Hills and Cool Springs Galleria, where new locations of stores previously exclusive to Bellevue Center began to open. Sears came to Bellevue Center in 1999 (shortly after Castner Knott became Proffitt's), building a new store on the empty anchor space in the northeast corner of the mall. Despite the arrival of a third anchor, foot traffic continued to suffer, and retailers began abandoning the mall in the early 2000s. Mall space began to be filled by professional services, churches, and the instructional arts. When Dillard's eventually closed its store and sold its property to the mall's owners (Oaktree Capital Management) in 2007 following years of declining sales, drastic plans for redevelopment were announced. Bellevue Center officially closed on May 31, 2008, when the last of its non-anchor tenants moved out. Since-abandoned redevelopment plans included converting the former Dillard's building into a branch of the Metro Nashville Public Library (bottom floor) and Kohl's department store (top level). The area formerly occupied by the mall itself would have been replaced with an open-air lifestyle center. Sears and Macy's announced initial intentions to remain open through the redevelopment process and anchor the redeveloped property, but Macy's chose Bellevue as one of eleven stores nationally to close during the late 2000s recession. When Macy's closed on March 15, 2009, Sears was left as the final operating retailer at Bellevue Center. In May 2015, Sears began liquidating its store, with plans to permanently close it in August 2015. During the fall of 2011, the Metro Government announced its intent to build a new Bellevue library elsewhere, abandoning its plans to locate at the mall site. Around the same time, Crosland Southeast began a new redevelopment plan for the former mall, which also was later withdrawn. The latest redevelopment plan, also by Crosland Southeast, was unveiled in November 2014. It calls for the demolition of the mall, replacing it with a mixed-use center called \\"One Bellevue Place\\", which would feature a hotel, a community ice rink facility operated by the Nashville Predators, 300 multifamily residential units, up to of professional and medical office space, a cinema multiplex, and up to of retail space. It was expected to be completed in 2018. One Bellevue Place opened in 2018. The renovated mall includes an AMC movie theater, along with Burlington, Michaels, Ulta Beauty, hotels, and an ice rink.

Holland's music career spans more than 30 years. She received a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist in 1981, following her eponymous debut album containing the single \\"How Do I Survive\\". Early life Amy Celeste Boersma was born in Palisades, New York, into a musical family. Her mother was country singer Esmereldy and her father was opera singer Harry Boersma. Holland is of Dutch descent and changed her name from Boersma to Holland (after her ancestors' origin country), because she thought it would make a better stage name. As a teenager, Holland moved to Los Angeles, California, in hope of making a career as a singer-songwriter. At the age of 15 she auditioned for the Beach Boys' Brother Records, but after the company folded, she signed with Capitol Records instead. Musical career Holland's eponymous debut studio album, produced by the Doobie Brothers' former lead singer Michael McDonald, was released in 1980 and featured the hit \\"How Do I Survive\\", which peaked at No. 22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Her second studio album titled On Your Every Word followed in 1983, featuring the single \\"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\\" a duet with Chris Christian, which peaked at No. 88 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it also peaked at No. 21 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That same year she contributed two songs to the soundtrack to the film Scarface. One of the songs Holland recorded for Scarface, \\"She's on Fire\\", was also featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto III. Holland went on to sing backing vocals on McDonald's albums, in addition to singing backing vocals on albums by other artists and bands such as First Call. In 2008, Holland released her third studio album, The Journey to Miracle River, on Chonin Records. Produced by her long-time friend Bernie Chiaravalle (singer/guitarist for McDonald since 1988), the album was recorded in Nashville over an 8-year period. Holland co-wrote 10 of the 12 songs with Chiaravalle along with other writers John Goodwin, Jon Vezner, and McDonald. Other songs were also penned by Robben Ford and Chazz Frichtel. This album marked Holland's return to the music industry after several years of hiatus to raise a family and deal with health issues. In 2016, she released her fourth studio album, Light On My Path. The album features a duet, \\"Prove That by Me\\" with Michael McDonald, in addition to background vocals by David Pack (Ambrosia), Joseph Williams (Toto), and David Crosby. Personal life Holland has been married to Michael McDonald since 1983. The couple live in Santa Barbara, California, and they have two children, Dylan and Scarlett. In 1995, Holland was diagnosed with cancer, and after many years of therapy, she is now in good health.

History The ASC was formed in 1974 and wholly incorporated in 1981. Originally known as 'The Gorillas', the football team wore a navy blue guernsey with an ACC monogram in reference to the Aberfeldie Community Centre which began in 1944 and evolved into the humble beginnings of the football section. Recently, club historian Gary Wicking has pored over vintage newspapers on microfilm dating back over a hundred years and has determined that there was documented evidence of fore- runners of the current club as early as 1893 for both football and cricket in the district. The first team to represent the club under its inaugural banner was an Under 17's team in 1948, winning the Club‚Äôs first premiership in 1951. The Senior club was established in 1950 winning the 1953 B-Grade premiership. The 1960s produced only one premiership, the Under 17's in 1966. After finishing second last in A-Grade in 1973 the club won the premiership in 1974. Several Grand Final appearances followed without success before being relegated to B-Grade in 1979. With Runners up in 1980 and 1981, the club won the B-Grade premiership in 1982 and promotion to A-Grade for 1983. Subsequently relegated back to B-Grade the club won the 1995 B-Grade premiership losing only one match for the season. Now also commonly known by the nickname 'Abers', the club's original playing strip was retired in 1999 and the following year (2000) a new striking design was implemented. That strip featured the official club colours Sky Blue with a Navy Blue flash (or zig zag) on the front panel. Over the next few seasons, the junior section replicated the new strip for each under age group until all teams were identical. However, after 12 seasons with this strip the club reverted to its original sky blue and navy blue yoke jumper for Season 2012. And like its predecessor, the junior sections adopted this version from Season 2013. Aberfeldie fielded 15 under age junior teams and in Season 2012 and ultimately, six of those teams won premierships which is an outstanding effort. The club's Under 18's which comes under the jurisdiction of Senior Football, won five consecutive premierships 2000‚Äì2004 which is an EDFL record for a single team and again in 2008 and 2012. This bodes well for the future with many players graduating from the ranks of the Under 18s to full senior level. In Seasons 2013 and 2014, the flagship senior teams coached by Mal Michael made their respective Grand Finals but lost both. With the appointment of Adam Potter as Coach for Season 2015, the team won all home and away matches and finals, taking out the ultimate prize‚Äîthe first senior Grand Final win in 41 years‚Äîa magnificent achievement for all concerned. The Under 18 teams also concurrently won a premiership each (Premier Division and Division 2) culminating a fantastic year for the club. With Adam Potter continuing as Senior Coach again in 2016, the flagship senior team made it to the Grand Final but were beaten by Keilor Football Club. The Under 18 team won their fifth consecutive premiership in a row. All look forward to further success in Season 2017. In 2017, the Essendon District Football League moved to an odd- numbered competition for all junior grades. This mechanism brings the EDFL in line with all other metropolitan Leagues across Melbourne. In a highly successful junior and senior season the Gorillas claimed the ultimate prize yet again despite losing several key players at the end of 2016. The much younger senior team claimed the club's second senior premiership in three years under Adam Potter with a dominant performance over Greenvale. In 2018 the senior team went back to back for the first time in the club's history with a convincing win over Keilor. Premierships Premiers: * A-Grade 1974, Premier Division 2015, 2017, & 2018\\\\.

It focuses on the misadventures of two 20-something women living in Brooklyn, New York. It was updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 1026 strips were published. The comic has been featured in an article in the New York Daily News. Octopus Pie ended on June 5, 2017. Content The comic largely follows a character-based narrative, mixing drama and light humor that sometimes borders on the surreal. With some swearing and partial nudity, it greatly relies on the juxtaposition of the two protagonists, as well as their relationships with and the relationships between other characters. Octopus Pie has the feel of an indie comic, focusing on young urbanites, usually from Gen Y. Main characters Everest \\"Eve\\" Ning Eve is a creative writing graduate from Brooklyn who has already become embittered at just about every aspect of her life, and the universe in general. Grumpy, cynical, and introverted, Eve has a menial job at Olly's Organix, an organic grocer, and has no clear idea about what she wants to do with her future. Early chapters of the strip focused on Eve's initially rocky relationship with her roommate Hanna, but the two have since become very close friends, despite their contrasting personalities and lifestyles. Eve's inhibitions and emotional distance have led many of her friends to view her as strong-willed and resilient, but Eve does not see herself this way. Hanna Thompson Eve's free-spirited, strong-willed and outgoing roommate Hanna is Eve's opposite in many respects, and early story arcs often focused on their Odd Couple-like relationship. Hanna moved in with Eve after Eve's mom found her on \\"the Craig List\\" and remembered Hanna as Eve's preschool classmate. Hanna's uninhibited, marijuana-fueled lifestyle is sometimes a source of friction between her and Eve. In contrast to the stereotypical stoner, Hanna is a professional, hard-working small-business owner. Her business, Bake'N'Bake, provides baked goods (which Hanna prepares while high on marijuana, lending the business its name) to a variety of cafes and specialty grocers throughout the city, including Eve's employer, Olly's Organix. She has been in a happy long-term relationship with her live-in boyfriend Marek since the strip began. Marek Kulasenski Hanna's warm-hearted, gentle boyfriend Marek is a Polish citizen attending graduate school in the city. He possesses a Zen- like calm and patience, and has almost never been provoked to anger. His relationship with Hanna is stable and happy, and Marek's accommodating nature is often instrumental in keeping the peace between the two. It's been hinted that Marek one day wants to raise a family, which may foreshadow darker times for the couple, as Hanna is adamant in her desire to never have children. Will LeBlanc Will is a bartender, marijuana dealer, and general \\"urban mercenary.\\" Will is charismatic and thoughtful, but his short temper and impulsive nature sometimes lead him to make poor decisions. He was briefly involved in a romantic relationship with Eve, but she ended their relationship when she learned that he was a drug dealer. Will lives with his longtime friend Larry, a sleazy-yet-likeable scam artist. A lengthy relationship with Hanna's friend Marigold ended with a nasty break-up. He is now dating a woman named Aimee, who he began seeing before breaking up with Marigold. It has been hinted that he and Eve still have some feelings for one another. Marigold Fuchs Hanna's best friend from college, Marigold is kind, easy-going, naive, and somewhat impressionable. She began as a minor character in Hanna's circle of friends, but has gradually become a central character. During Marigold's relationship with Will, she was in awe of the perceived glamor and excitement of Will's life as a drug dealer until she accompanied him for a day on the job and learned that it was actually fairly mundane. In the aftermath their very rough and painful break-up, Marigold cut off her dreadlocks and reevaluated her life. Although disillusioned with her job, Marigold eventually decided to accept a lucrative promotion at Bed and Bath 3000 and moved into an upscale Manhattan apartment using her new salary. Plot arcs Introductions Fairly self-explanatory, introduces the general flow of the comic. Eve has just broken up with her boyfriend, James, and Hanna moves in. Eve's job and the general state of her life is introduced. Bicycle Rights Eve's bicycle (Mr. Pedals) is stolen, which prompts her to become paranoid about security. Bake n' Bake Explores the mystery of what Hanna does for a living, also introduces Marek and Will. A link to the official Bake N' Bake website can be found here. Grocery Misconduct Hanna goes topless in Central Park while Marek gives Eve the inspiration to learn of 'Duck Zen' when she spots her ex-boyfriend James with another girl. Then When Olly, Eve's boss, needs to come up with a new ad campaign for the store, Eve jokingly draws a crude dog that calls the store \\"The Fukken Shit\\" - not knowing that the drawing will be seen as Olly's temporary downfall and Eve's temporary popularity. Natural Phenomenon When James, Eve's ex-boyfriend unexpectedly shows up at their front door, Eve and Hanna make a run for it (Hanna thinking James is a Narc), and Eve eventually winds up hanging out with Will. Eve then discovers that Will is Hannah's drug dealer. Skate or Don't On an ice skating outing, Hanna cracks her coccyx and Eve confronts a rival from her childhood. Eve's father appears in flashbacks. Our Brooklynian Life While hanging out with Hanna, Eve finds and cares for a parrot. While the parrot gives her added attention, she also has to deal with the return of Will. Tag Eve's old friends and Hannah's stoner buddies collide for a game of Laser Tag as Eve rekindles a romance with ex-boyfriend Park. Renaissance Unfair Hanna recruits her friends to help her gain independence from Olly's Organix at a Renaissance Fair. Will becomes embroiled in courtly love and a fight with the coordinator's son. Octopus Pie Love Comics A brief interlude starring Julie of Olly's Organix in her quest for love. Dumbo Olly's latest attempt at staying profitable is Ollyween, and all his employees must participate. Interview Park interviews for a law firm with some pretty awful results. Exile on Jericho Turnpike Eve visits her brother and her father for his birthday and troubles about the amount of influence she has in their lives. Love Anxiously It's Valentine's Day and everyone gets a little lesson in jealousy. Lifetime TV The Ning siblings grew up wishing they could be contestants on their favorite shopping-based gameshow. Today, they stumble upon reality. This is How I Deal Feeling hopeless in her day-to-day life, Marigold decides that surely, Will's job must be more interesting. A drug- dealing adventure awaits! Snowy Patrol Hanna agrees to watch Park's dog Snowy for the weekend, in hopes of gaining his trust. Meanwhile, the possibility arises that Park (and Eve, by extension) could be leaving town soon. Beer Your Own Boss Olly figures out that beer is made by people, and orders Eve, Julie and Jacob to make some for the store. Fear Part 1 The annual bike festival is upon Brooklyn, and with it comes a whole laundry list of anxieties. Fear Part 2 The bike festival concludes with Hanna and her unicycle-riding rival, Park's secret is revealed, and Eve's bittersweet conclusion about fear. Who Are Parents A visit to Hanna's parents' house leads to the discovery of a terrible, terrible artifact. Eve, meanwhile, is pondering the role of parents in her life. Couch Sitter Eve, Hanna and Marek have a soft-spoken house guest named Victor. Frontwards Eve and Park's relationship has reached a crossroads, and whatever happens is going to suck. Moving On Eve, Hanna and Marek suddenly decide to leave home. Apartment-hopping abound. GO Team Willary Will is rejoined by his partner and friend Larry, who has a new business venture. Their reunion is not without some girl troubles and introspection. Octopus DIE A non-canon whodunnit as Will rents out a mansion for what is supposed to be an awesome Halloween party. Pretty much everyone dies. The Brownout Biscuit Some unfortunate events disrupt the adults' social group. Hanna and Eve each take the blame for Marigold's despair, and try to fix things in unimaginable ways. Social issues While Octopus Pie is primarily a humorous strip, it has dealt with wider social issues, such as the right for women to go topless.

(1906). Dictionnaire d‚Äôhistoire et de g√©ographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). \\"Niwa,\\" Nobiliare du Japon, p. 43; retrieved 2013-5-5. The Kodama clan was one of several samurai clans originally located in Musashi Province. A branch of the clan settled in Owari Province, of which a branch resided in Niwa District. It is uncertain when they adopted the \\"Niwa\\" surname, but during the Muromachi period were in service of the Shiba clan, who were the shugo of Owari Province. The clan rose to prominence in the Sengoku period. Niwa Nagahide became a senior retainer of Oda Nobunaga and after Nobunaga was assassinated at the Honn≈ç-ji Incident, helped Toyotomi Hideyoshi defeat the forces of Akechi Mitsuhide at the Battle of Yamazaki. He also assisted Hideyoshi at the Battle of Shizugatake, and was rewarded with the provinces of Wakasa and Echizen and two districts of Kaga Province, for a total kokudaka of 1,230,000 koku, making him one of the most powerful Sengoku-daimy≈ç. However, after Niwa Nagahide died in 1585, the clan's fortunes under Niwa Nagashige fell with equal rapidity. During the Siege of Toyama against the forces of Sassa Narimasa, Hideyoshi accused the Niwa clan with collaboration, and seized most of their territories, leaving the clan with only Wakasa Province at 150,000 koku. During the subsequent Ky≈´sh≈´ Campaign in 1589, one of the Niwa clan retainers was again accused of collaboration with the enemy, and the clan was reduced further to a small 40,000 koku holding around Komatsu in Kaga Province. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was mercurial in his moods, and in response to Niwa Nagashige's efforts at the Siege of Odawara, his status was brought back to 120,000 koku. In 1600, the Niwa clan sided with Ishida Mitsunari's Western Army against the Tokugawa at the Battle of Sekigahara and was thus dispossessed. The victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu chose to be magnanimous, and with the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, awarded Niwa Nagashige with a 10,000 koku domain in Hitachi Province. Nagashige's forces fought well at the 1614 Siege of Osaka, and in 1619 his revenues were increased to 20,000 koku, and in 1622 he was transferred to the 50,000 koku Tanakura Domain in Mutsu Province. In 1627, he was transferred once again to Shirakawa Domain, at 100,700 koku. In 1643, Nagashige's son, Niwa Mitsushige, as transferred to Nihonmatsu Domain (100,700 koku), where the clan remained until the Meiji restoration. During the Boshin War, Niwa Nagakuni joined the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei in 1868; however, his forces were defeated by the Satch≈ç Alliance and Nihonmatsu Castle was burned. The victorious Meiji government reduced the domain to 50,700 koku under the final daimy≈ç Niwa Nagahiro, who subsequently served as imperial governor until the abolition of the han system in 1871. In 1884, he became a viscount (shishaku) under the kazoku peerage system. Another clan, the Isshiki-Niwa, who were daimy≈ç of Mikusa Domain (10,000 koku) in Harima Province from 1746 to 1871, bears the same Niwa but is not directly related to the above.

It was taken out of service in 1964 when Mill Brook Road was relocated a short distance to the south, but remains in excellent condition and is open to foot traffic. In 1999, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Structure The bridge is located on the west corner of the junction of Mill Brook and Fred Davis roads a short distance east of the Delaware County line. The area is wooded, just under in elevation with the ground sloping gently to the northeast. It spans the brook, a tributary of the East Branch of the Delaware River that drains into New York City's Pepacton Reservoir, just to the west of a more modern bridge carrying vehicle traffic. It is a single span, in length, supported by rough abutments of dry-laid fieldstone. Its superstructure incorporates the Town lattice truss design. Both chords and the diagonals, connected by wood pins at each intersection, are formed by heavy paired planks. Planks laid on stringers form the deck; alternating timbers protrude to create a series of four buttresses on the sides of the bridge. Vertical board sheathing on horizontal nailers constitutes the bridge's siding; the roof and buttresses are clad in wood shingles. History In 1902 the town of Hardenburgh awarded local carpenter Edgar Marks the contract to build a bridge over Mill Brook near the county line, a couple of miles below its headwaters on Balsam Lake Mountain. It would serve the small population of farmers and millers that lived in the remote valley. With help from his son Orrin, he got to work hauling the stone and cutting the planks. He used the Town lattice truss, a reliable design for building a lasting bridge of this size from local materials. With the help of several other local craftsmen, the bridge was opened late that year. It took its popular name from a mill two miles (3 km) to the west at the intersection of Mill Brook and what is now Kittle Road. Grant's Mill was often used in giving directions, as at that time the road was not maintained year-round. Marks called it the Lattice Bridge in his reports to the town; officials referred to it by his name.Baker, Betty. Notice posted in bridge. December 2004. It would later withstand and serve automobile traffic as well. When Mill Brook Road was realigned in 1964, the bridge was taken out of service. It remained in place despite the neglect. In the early 1990s Marks' descendants restored it. The town board renamed it the Millbrook Bridge in 2002, after it had been listed on the Register, to avoid further confusion.

He is known for publishing a series of significant volumes of English Renaissance drama, including works by William Shakespeare, Robert Greene, John Lyly, and Thomas Nashe. Beginnings Burby (\\"sometimes confused with Cuthbert Burbage,\\"Halliday, p. 77. John Payne Collier thought the two were one and the same. though there is no known connection between the two men) was the son of Edmund Burby, a farmer in Erlsey, Bedfordshire. Cuthbert Burby was apprenticed to the stationer William Wright for eight years as of Christmas 1584, and became a \\"freeman\\" (full member) of the Stationers Company on 13 January 1592. He did business in London between 1592 and 1607. As his title pages attest, his shops were located 1) \\"under Saint Mildred's Church in the Poultry,\\" 2) \\"at the Royal Exchange,\\" and 3) \\"in Paul's Churchyard at the sign of the Swan.\\" He had \\"a large, flourishing, respectable business....\\"Sheavyn, p. 69. Early in his career as a publisher, Burby issued works in the famous controversy between Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey. Curiously, Burby published works in their exchange by both Nashe and Harvey; his connection, it appears, was not personal or ideological ‚Äì just business.Sheavyn, pp. 86‚Äì7. He also published Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller (1594) and Lenten Stuff (1599). Shakespeare Regarding Shakespeare: Burby published two key editions of Shakespearean works, the first quarto of Love's Labor's Lost (1598; printed by William White) and the second quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1599; printed by Thomas Creede). The title page of the R&J; Q2 states that that edition was \\"Newly corrected, augmented, and amended\\" ‚Äì which has been interpreted to indicate that Q2 was issued as a deliberate correction and replacement for the defective Q1, the \\"bad quarto\\" printed by John Danter in 1597. The title page of Burby's Q1 of LLL, the earliest play text to be printed under Shakespeare's name, also claims that that edition was \\"Newly corrected and augmented\\" ‚Äì which has been taken by some commentators as a possible indication of an earlier \\"bad quarto\\" of LLL that has not survived.Halliday, pp. 77‚Äì8, 288‚Äì9, 420. Burby had subsidiary connections with the Shakespeare canon as well. He published Palladis Tamia (1598) by Francis Meres, which contains an important reference to Shakespeare and a list of Shakespearean works produced up to 1598. Burby also published (with no attribution of authorship) the first two quartos of The Taming of a Shrew (Q1, 1594; Q2, 1596), the early alternative version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.Scholars dispute the precise relationship between The Shrew and A Shrew; see Steven Roy Miller's 1998 edition of A Shrew from Cambridge University Press. Also, Burby issued the two early quartos of Edward III (1596, 1599), the one play of the Shakespeare Apocrypha that is most commonly seen as having at least some of Shakespeare's work in it. Other drama Burby published a number of other plays, attributed or anonymous, during his career: * The Cobbler's Prophecy, Robert Wilson (1594) * George a Greene, or The Pinner of Wakefield (1599) * A Knack to Know an Honest Man (1596) * Mother Bombie, John Lyly (1594, 1598) * Orlando Furioso, Robert Greene (1594, 1599). Burby's relationship with the texts of Robert Greene is worth noting; in addition to Orlando Furioso, Burby issued Greene's pamphlets The Third and Last Part of Coney-Catching and The Repentance of Robert Greene (both 1592). The play George a Greene has sometimes been attributed to Greene's pen. Burby often worked with the printers John Danter and Simon Stafford, as with many of the texts listed above. Other works Also in 1594, Burby published The Second Report of Doctor Faustus, Containing His Appearances, and the Deeds of Wagner ‚Äì an anonymous prose work that elaborated the story of the magician, and which was written to capitalise on the success of Marlowe's famous play Doctor Faustus. And he published Thomas Lodge's Wit's Misery and the World's Madness in 1596. Burby published other books on a range of subjects. He was one of the three publishers who issued Robert Allot's verse anthology England's Parnassus in 1600 (the other two being Nicholas Ling and Thomas Heyes). He published many religious works, as did all the publishers of his era; and he issued some of the multi-volume chivalric romances that were the best-sellers of the age, like The Mirror of Knighhood and Champions of Christendom. Post mortem The exact date of Burby's death is not known, though it fell between 24 August and 26 September in 1607. In 1609 Burby's widow assigned his copyrights ‚Äì mainly of theological works ‚Äì to the publisher's former apprentice Nicholas Bourne. Bourn had printed no dramatic works in his career, but was a successful publisher of news who worked for many years in partnership with Nathaniel Butter.Plomer, p. 29.Jayne E. E. Boys, London's News Press and the Thirty Years War, Suffolk and N.Y., 2011 The overall quality of Burby's work as a publisher has been variously evaluated. Commentators have complained about the quality of the printing in some of Burby's texts; while Burby was not a printer, it can be asserted that he should have employed better craftsmen. It has even been argued that the printing in the \\"bad quarto\\" of Romeo and Juliet, Danter's 1597 Q1, is superior to the printing of the Burby/Creede Q2, the \\"good\\" quarto of 1599 ‚Äì that Q2 \\"is on the whole less carefully printed than Q1.\\"Evans, p. 208.

Plot On a dark and stormy night, an elderly pharmacist falls asleep at his stool while mixing poisonous chemicals in a glass bottle. After he falls asleep, the night takes a sudden fantastical turn as his poisonous bottle‚Äîtopped with a \\"skull and crossbones\\" stopper as a warning label‚Äîsuddenly springs to life, becoming a malevolent cackling skeleton. Laughing evilly, and screaming \\"Death walks tonight!\\", the skeleton douses the pharmacist with chemicals that mysteriously cause him to shrink. Waking up, the pharmacist sets out to explore his store in his new minuscule form and finds that all of the bottles in the pharmacy have similarly sprung to life, with most of them taking on colorful personalities based on their contents: three baby bottles become a trio of crying babies, a bottle of Scotch whiskey becomes a jolly Scotsman (married to the bottle of rum that sits next to him), a bottle of Absorbine and Absorbine Jr. become a father and son, a container of vanishing cream playfully vanishes and reappears, a bottle of smelling salts sniffs everyone in close proximity, and a bottle of India ink takes the form of an Indian snake charmer‚Äîcharming a tube of \\"Cobra Toothpaste\\" that becomes a live snake. With the evil skeleton nowhere in sight, the pharmacist joins the bottles in their merriment as they all begin to sing, dance and frolic in turn: three bottles of Cuban rum sing a Spanish song, a pair of rubber gloves spring to life and tap-dance, a bottle of Carmencita-brand powder and a bottle of toilet water dance a flamenco dance, a pair of salt shakers come to life as Dutch children and go ice-skating on a mirror while a bottle of talcum powder drops imaginary snow on them, a bottle of shaving cream happily takes up a shaving razor, and the pharmacist finally takes up a smoking pipe and begins playing it like a tuba. But all is not well in the pharmacy, as the skeleton has secretly formed an alliance with a small cadre of evil bottles that inhabit the darker corners of the shelves: a bottle of witch hazel springs to life as an old witch, and several bottles of spirits of ammonia open up to release a trio of mischievous singing ghosts. As the witch and the skeleton mix a poisonous brew in the pharmacist's beakers and test tubes, the ghosts fly out to snatch up the pharmacist and bring him back to the skeleton. As the skeleton cackles triumphantly, the ghosts hurl the pharmacist into the glass distiller as it bubbles with chemicals. Helpless, the pharmacist is sent hurtling through the twisting tubes of his distiller, chased and ground up in a mincer (which splits him up into tiny duplicates of himself), only to be hurled back into the distiller after the skeleton sucks him up in a syringe. After sending him through the distiller twice, the skeleton finally traps the pharmacist in a glass beaker, laughing as he ties him up with rubber tubing and attacks him with a pair of scissors, threatening to snip him in half. Finally, when the pharmacist's death seems certain, he wakes up at his stool, unharmed and back to his normal size. Looking to his bottle of poisonous chemicals, the pharmacist realizes that he had merely been having a nightmare, and laughs in relief. Characters The Pharmacist is an old and ancient man who is working late making some magical chemicals, liquids and potions around the interior of the old, and vintage apothecary building with windows, top and glass bottom shelves, and a table with a stool.

In 1996 she was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame for her development of the Silicon Eye and other computational systems. She died by suicide at age 33. Early life and education Mahowald, known as Misha, was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, daughter of Alfred and Joan Fischer Mahowald. She had a younger sister, Sheila. After graduating high school, she attended the California Institute of Technology, graduating with a degree in biology in 1985. She continued at Caltech as a PhD student in Computation and Neural Systems under the supervision of Professor Carver Mead, a specialist in VLSI. For her thesis, Mahowald created her own project by combining the fields of biology, computer science, and electrical engineering, to produce the silicon retina. Career The silicon retina used analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells, cone cells, and other non-photoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye. The invention was not only highly original and potentially useful as a device for restoring sight to the blind, but it was also one of the most eclectic feats of electrical and biological engineering of the time. This remarkable example of engineering earned Mahowald a well-deserved reputation as one of the most famous female engineers of her age. Her work has been considered \\"the best attempt to date\\" to develop a stereoscopic vision system. She was awarded a doctorate in computational neuroscience in 1992, and her invention of the silicon retina and the silicon neuron earned her articles in the prestigious scientific journals Scientific American and Nature, as well as four patents and the Clauser PrizeClauser Prize, California Institute of Technology for her dissertation. A revised version of her dissertation was subsequently published in book form.Mahowald, M: \\"An Analog VLSI System for Stereoscopic Vision\\", Kluwer Academic press, 1994 Mahowald then re-located to the University of Oxford for one year to do a post-doctoral fellowship with eminent neuroscientists Kevan Martin and Rodney Douglas. After the completion of this project, Mahowald moved to Z√ºrich to help found the Institute of Neuroinformatics (Institut f√ºr Neuroinformatik) at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, a research institution whose mission is to discover the key principles by which brains work and to implement these in artificial systems that interact intelligently with the real world.Home page of the Institute of Neuroinformatics In 1996, she was made a member of the Women in Technology International (WITI) Hall of Fame.Dr. Misha Mahowald page in the WITI Hall of fame Mahowald died in Z√ºrich at the end of 1996, taking her own life at the age of 33.

Bui Thanh Nhan (Thich Tri Quang), and Bhante Kassapa Bhikkhu, Assistant Abbot. Tradition: Theravada  Activities and Schedule  The temple holds regular services in Vietnamese at 11 a.m. on Sundays and English on Sundays at 2 p.m. with a Pali chanting class that follows the service at 3 p.m. Also, there is a weekly meditation class every Wednesday at 7 p.m. There are many festivals held throughout the year including the very popular and well visited Lotus Blossom Festival, which also is part of the Vesak celebration. During this celebration, the temple's well- known water gardens are visited by upwards of several thousand people over one weekend in early June.  Demographics  The congregation consists of Vietnamese immigrants and their children. Since the meditation classes have started in February 2007, a medium-sized group of non-Vietnamese Americans have started attending regularly. This temple has the largest amount of non- Vietnamese speaking people in a Theravada Vietnamese Temple in the United States.  Teachers  = Bhante Kassapa Bhikkhu = He served in the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War. He then began his formal training in the Jesuit Associate Program in Houston. Eventually, Bhante Kassapa Bhikkhu joined the Franciscan order as a monk. When he left that order, he spent 16 years studying Buddhism while working in the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority in Tampa, Florida. He was ordained as a novice monk in October 2006 at Phat Phap Buddhist Temple in St. Petersburg, Florida. After one full year, he became a fully ordained bhikkhu at Buu Mon Buddhist Temple in Port Arthur, Texas. Bhante Kassapa Bhikkhu is currently a resident monk at Buu Mon Buddhist Temple, a Theravada Vietnamese temple in Port Arthur, Texas. He is the chaplain to the Buddhist inmates at the minimum security federal correction facility in Beaumont, Texas. Since he took over the prison ministry from the previous chaplain, the attendance went from 7 inmates to 20 inmates and growing. He also runs a weekly meditation group that usually ranges from 20 to 40 people each week. He hopes to one day create an American-style Theravada Buddhist temple. Averaging every six weeks, he also speaks at the Unity Church of Beaumont to their weekly meditation group. He gave one of the two keynote speeches at Oklahoma City University for the 10th Annual Oklahoma Buddhist Conference. Also, he spoke at the 2008 Human Rights Torch Relay Demonstration in Houston Texas, South East Texas World Peace Event in 2007, and a Lamar University World Religions course.

History Interior of Oak Court Mall The mall began as a freestanding, 3-story Goldsmith's, a Memphis-based department store, in 1961. In the early 1970s, Goldsmith's constructed a 3-story structure immediately to the west of the existing store. The upper two levels of this structure served as parking, while the bottom level was connected to the first floor of the existing store and served as additional retail space. In the late 1970s, Goldsmith's once again expanded with an addition of the original building to the north. This addition contained 2 floors of above ground retail space. A portion of this expansion was converted to Goldsmith's Furniture Gallery in the late 1980s when the rest of the mall was built. In 1986, Belz Enterprises began construction on the mall immediately to the west of Goldsmith's. The first floor of the mall was constructed below ground while the second floor was at ground level. The mall opened in 1988 with the anchors of Lord & Taylor and Goldsmith's. Lord & Taylor closed its store in 1992. The former Lord & Taylor store became Dillards, which was formerly located in Poplar Plaza. In 1995, Dillards built a store expansion in the center court of the mall for the men's and children's store while the existing Dillards on the west end of the mall became the women's store. In 2005, Federated Department Stores rebranded all of the Goldsmith's locations as Macy's. This mall was home to the first Starbucks location in the state of Tennessee. The shop was closed in 2013 and relocated to the second level of Macy's.

The New York Times reviewed the book, writing that it gives \\"the reader an intimate sense of the president‚Äôs personality and how it informs his decision making.\\" He has also written a novel Hadrian's Walls, published in 1999, which The New York Times called \\"deft and occasionally ingenious.\\" In April 2012, Draper published Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives, which the Huffington Post described as \\"much-discussed and heavily-reported.\\" Writing in the Wall Street Journal, ABC News senior political correspondent Jonathan Karl called the book \\"a refreshingly balanced account that captures the drama of one of Congress's most combative and maddeningly frustrating years in memory.\\" Personal life Draper was married to Meg Littleton in the late 1990s and early 2000s. On November 16, 2016, fellow journalist Kirsten Powers announced her engagement to Draper. Bibliography =Books= * *Hadrian's walls, Knopf, 1999,  * =Essays and reporting= * Kate del Castillo.

This film was made in 2006, after the Orange Revolution which took place in Ukraine. It was directed by Oleksandr Kyryenko with the Cinema Production. Mini-Synopsis The movie tells of a love story of two greatly different young people. The heroine, Ivanna is a young girl with ambitiously nationalistic beliefs in the power of democracy. She expresses her patriotism by voicing, often protesting the present regime of Ukraine in the favor of revolutionary ideals. Mark, the protagonist, on the other hand is a privileged son of a government official whose life is filled with excitement from being able to get everything his heart desires. The two meet in the midst of a national crisis when a series of massive protests and political events were unfolding in Ukraine. Of course with the meeting, the two fall in love forever changing each other's paths. Mark is unwillingly becoming estranged from his comfortable life and seeks to obtain understanding of what drives Ivana and her friends to stand up to authority. Eventually two are united in one cause: fighting for a better future for their country. The movie uses a semi-reenactment of the actual events of the winter in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution. The protests, the rioting, the cold weather are all there.

It was erected in 1865, one of the first bridges over the river in what was then still a largely unsettled region of the Catskill Mountains. It uses an unusual modification of the lattice truss design perfected earlier in the 19th century by Ithiel Town. There is some dispute over which of three men claimed as its builder actually did; it is likely that all of them had some role. It is one of the 29 historic covered bridges in New York State. After undergoing some repairs over the course of the late 20th century, in 2007 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the northernmost property listed in Sullivan County and the only one of four covered bridges in it to be listed. Repair and maintenance efforts continue. Structure The bridge is located along Campsite Road (County Route 30) in an area with the public campground, one of the oldest in the Catskill Park, on both sides of the river. It goes almost due east-west across a south-flowing stretch of the Beaver Kill's generally east-southeast flow at this point, nearly above sea level. The entire area is heavily forested and minimally developed. The road curves from the Cragie Clair Road junction to the south and ends at Berry Brook Road just across the bridge, a short distance south of the Delaware County line. It is a hemlock lattice truss bridge supported by dry-laid fieldstone abutments faced in concrete at either end. On the east a ten-foot (3 m) approach ramp supported by a steel I-beam leads up slightly to the portal past a rustic wooden fence along either side of the road that becomes timber guide rails. A plank deck wide is supported by eight irregularly spaced stringers atop wood planks. Four of the cross beams extend beyond the bridge where they connect to the upper chord via sway braces. On either side vertical board-and-batten siding begins a foot below the lower chord and rises to a gabled metal roof, high, supported by tie-beam rafters with transverse metal rods and diagonal cross-bracing. Interior clearance is only , enforced by metal height restrictors near the portals. Two sets of heavy timber planks serve as the top and bottom chords, with a secondary lower chord at deck level. Twelve-inch (30 cm) diagonals, fastened at each intersection by two- inch (5 cm) treenails, radiate out from the middle to either end. They are supplemented by additional diagonals at the ends and four wooden buttresses along the exterior on either side. History The bridge was an early step in bringing civilization to a remote area that had remained mostly unsettled well into the 19th century. It remained long after the small town that grew around it went into decline. In the mid-20th century a proposal to replace it aroused community opposition, and it has received extensive repairs since then. =1865‚Äì1880s: Core of a tannery town= For much of the early 19th century northern Sullivan County remained largely unsettled, partly due to ongoing land title disputes from the Hardenburgh Patent and partly due to its ruggedness and shortage of arable land. Only loggers, hunters and trappers ventured into the remote valley of the Beaverkill above its confluence with Willowemoc Creek via an 1815 road. A tannery was established near the bridge site in 1832, processing the bark of the abundant Eastern Hemlock trees in the region into tannin for the leather industry. The small hamlet of Beaverkill grew up around it, and several other tanneries followed. That remained the only settlement in the area for some time. In 1859 the Town of Rockland was still described as \\"a rough, wild region\\". Seven years after the bridge was built in 1865, it had a population of roughly a hundred, a school and a post office. A bridge probably existed, though no record has been found.Bennett, 4. The bridge has long been attributed locally to John Davidson, a Scottish immigrant whose father had settled the family in Downsville to the north to raise sheep. After his marriage, Davidson moved to Shin Creek (today Lew Beach) where he farmed, logged and owned a sawmill while raising a family of 14. One of the younger children, J.D. Davidson, said in a letter late in his own life, in 1942, that his father had built the bridge, along with two other covered bridges in the town over the Willowemoc, only one of which (Van Tran Flat) is extant. In the 1970s, descendants of Davidson's younger brother Thomas claimed it was he who had built the bridge. An 1895 Delaware County biographical review further credits James Coulter of Bovina with the Beaverkill bridge as well as several others. Coulter's biography says, he had moved from bridge building to general carpentry by 1859, before the bridge's construction date. He was, however, still alive at the time the biographical review was published and could have served as a source for it. It is likely that all three worked on the bridge. Coulter was also the son of Scottish immigrants to the area and likely acquainted with the Davidsons. On a large public project it is also likely that several local people with the requisite expertise were involved to some degree. The bridge's design is the lattice truss patented earlier in the century by Ithiel Town in 1820. Its distinctive feature is the diagonals connected to the lower chord by pins, which eliminated the need for vertical members on longer bridges. It remained popular through the American Civil War, making the Beaverkill bridge one of the last of its kind. A major deviation from Town's design are the additional diagonals at the ends, which distribute the load over a smaller area and eliminates the need for long abutment seats of bolster beams. A patent was granted in 1863 for a similar variation on Town's design, so it is quite likely that this technique was not developed by the builder of the Beaverkill bridge. It is, however, unusual for New York. Davidson's three are the only ones known to have been built in the state. =1880s‚Äìpresent: Restored community icon= The bridge is first shown on local maps in 1875. After the 1880s, the combination of depleted hemlock stands and a synthetic process for making tannin led to the demise of that industry along the upper Beaverkill. It was replaced by seasonal visitors who came to appreciate the scenic beauty of the area, now with some landholdings part of the state's recently created Forest Preserve and thus kept \\"forever wild\\", and its recreational offerings, particularly dry-fly fishing for trout in the upper Beaver Kill. Railroads, and later automobiles, made the valley more accessible than it had been to previous generations of anglers, and litter and other overuse problems began developing along those stretches of the river accessible to the public. In response, during the 1920s the state began constructing areas where those anglers could camp. While the hamlet of Beaverkill had dwindled to almost a ghost town, it was the site of a trout pool popular with anglers,Bennett, 5. and thus the area on both sides of the bridge was turned into the second public campground in the Catskill Park after North-South Lake. Its facilities were further refined by Civilian Conservation Corps workers in the late 1930s; it became the prototype for other state-owned campgrounds in and outside of the Catskills. The town proposed to replace it with a more modern metal bridge in 1948. It abandoned the plan in response to preservation efforts led by a local citizen. Instead of demolishing it, the town board spent $700 (equivalent to $ in ) to restore it, although it is not known what work was done. As part of the preservation, ownership of the bridge was transferred to the county. Over the next several decades, it made repairs and replacements as needed, including facing the abutments in concrete, the only significant change in the bridge's appearance since its construction. In the late 1990s, the bridge was surveyed and inventoried for the Historic American Engineering Record. At that time, the county opposed listing it on the National Register since its Department of Public Works felt that could hamper their efforts to assure its safety. The local bridge committee also feared that designating it as a historic structure would increase the costs of running the bridge in a way that could not be offset by the grants available. The height restrictors and load limit were imposed at the end of the 20th century.Bennett, 2 and 5. Along with a century-old iron bridge nearby, the Beaverkill Bridge is the only crossing into the rest of the town and county for the residents on the river's north side. Both are regarded as structurally deficient for modern needs and have reduced load limits that may preclude their use by heavier service and emergency vehicles. In 2000 the state studied what it could do to address that problem. Eight years later the bridge was closed for repairs, requiring a three-mile (5 km) detour via Craigie Claire Road. A $72,000 federal grant the following year, 2009, was meant for further repairs.

He was Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge for Wisconsin's 5th circuit for the last 37 years of his life. Biography George Clementson was born in Yorkshire, England, to Joseph Clementson and Elizabeth (Peacock) Clementson. In 1849, the Clementson family emigrated from England to the United States, settling in Hazel Green, Wisconsin. His father was a wheelwright and wagonmaker, and Clementson worked in his shop as a young man. He saved his money and used his leisure time to study, and in 1865 he attended the University of Michigan. He was unable to complete his studies and returned to his father's shop in 1866. In the fall of 1867, Clementson began the study of law in the office of J. Allen Barber, who at that time had served as district attorney and had been elected several times to the Wisconsin Legislature. Clementson was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin in 1868, and later that year he was elected district attorney for Grant County. He was re-elected two years later. In 1869, he and Barber formed a partnership, which prospered after Barber's election to congress in 1870, and lasted until Barber's death in 1881. In April 1882, Clementson was elected Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge for the 5th circuit. He defeated incumbent Judge Montgomery Morrison Cothren and was subsequently re-elected six times, dying in office in 1920. Family left George Clementson married Mary Asenath Burr on May 11, 1869. Mary was a niece of his law partner, J. Allen Barber, and a descendant of Aaron Burr. Their first child was George Burr Clementson, who followed in his father's footsteps, establishing his own law practice in Lancaster; within three years of his 1892 graduation from Cornell Law School, George B. Clementson had authored the first treatise on bicycle law.History of Grant County, Wisconsin. Chicago: Western Historical Company, 1881, pp. 887‚Äì888. Clementson died in Lancaster on March 30, 1920.

Initially the union was intended to be an organizational body through which the interests of writers in Hungary could be represented. It grew to become a major voice of dissension against the Communist regime in Hungary during the 1950s and had a significant role in sparking the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.  History  After the ascension of a communist government in Hungary, the Hungarian Writers Union became a tool through which the communist regime imposed its Stalinist literary policies and propaganda. Its weekly paper, the Irodalmi √öjs√°g (Literary Gazette), propagated communist literary works and culture. In the early 1950s, however, the Union's membership shifted to an increasingly less communistic ideology. By 1955, most of the high-ranking members of the Union were non-communists and decided to use the Irodalmi √öjs√°g as a means to call for reforms in the Hungarian government. This shift in ideology was instrumental in encouraging several other unions within Hungary to do the same.  Sparking the revolution  On the afternoon of 23 October 1956, approximately 20,000 protesters convened next to the statue of J√≥zsef Bem - a national hero of Poland and Hungary.Video (in Hungarian): The First Hours of the Revolution P√©ter Veres, President of the Writers‚Äô Union, read a manifesto to the crowd,Hungarian Revolt, 23 October‚Äì4 November 1956 (Richard Lettis and William I.

Later that day, a large crowd gathered at the Radio Budapest building, which was heavily guarded by the √ÅVH. The flash point was reached as a delegation attempting to broadcast their demands was detained and the crowd grew increasingly unruly as rumors spread that the protesters had been shot. Tear gas was thrown from the upper windows and the √ÅVH opened fire on the crowd, killing many.UN General Assembly Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary (1957) The √ÅVH tried to re-supply itself by hiding arms inside an ambulance, but the crowd detected the ruse and intercepted it. Hungarian soldiers sent to relieve the √ÅVH hesitated and then, tearing the red stars from their caps, sided with the crowd. Provoked by the √ÅVH attack, protesters reacted violently. Police cars were set ablaze, guns were seized from military depots and distributed to the masses and symbols of the communist regime were vandalized.UN General Assembly Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary (1957) During the night of 23 October, Hungarian Working People's Party Secretary Ern≈ë Ger≈ë requested Soviet military intervention \\"to suppress a demonstration that was reaching an ever greater and unprecedented scale.\\" The Soviet leadership had formulated contingency plans for intervention in Hungary several months before. (page 160). Gati states: \\"discovered in declassified documents, the Soviet Ministry of Defense had begun to prepare for large-scale turmoil in Hungary as early as July 1956. Codenamed \\"Wave\\", the plan called for restoration of order in less than six hours... the Soviet Army was ready. More than 30,000 troops were dispatched to‚Äîand 6,000 reached‚ÄîBudapest by the 24th, that is, in less than a day.\\" By 2 a.m. on 24 October, under orders of the Soviet defence minister, Soviet tanks entered Budapest.UN General Assembly Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary (1957) Early that morning, Gyula H√°y and the Hungarian Writers' Union broadcast a desperate plea for Western aid in several languages: Via playwright Juilius Hay, \\"To every writer in the world, to all scientists, to all writers' federations, to all science academies and associations, to the intelligentsia of the world! We ask all of you for help and support; there is but little time! You know the facts, there is no need to give you a special report! Help Hungary! Help the Hungarian writers, scientists, workers, peasants, and our intelligentsia!\\"Paul Lendvai, \\"One Day That Shook the Communist World: The 1956 Hungarian Uprising and Its Legacy\\", (Princeton University Press, 2010), 154. Western aid did not come and the revolt was put down. Although the Writers Union was banned at the end of the revolution, some of its editors emigrated to western Europe and kept the organization alive. The first copy of Irodalmi √öjs√°g printed outside of Hungary was published in London on March 15, 1957. In 1962, the Union set up editorial offices in Paris and the last copy of Irodalmi √öjs√°g was printed in 1989, 33 years after the Hungarian Revolution.

Major functions of an OMS  Major functions usually found in an OMS include: * Prediction of location of transformer, fused, recloser or breaker that opened upon failure. * Prioritizing restoration efforts and managing resources based upon criteria such as locations of emergency facilities, size of outages, and duration of outages. * Providing information on extent of outages and number of customers impacted to management, media and regulators. * Calculation of estimation of restoration times. * Management of crews assisting in restoration. * Calculation of crews required for restoration.  OMS principles and integration requirements  At the core of a modern outage management system is a detailed network model of the distribution system. The utility's geographic information system (GIS) is usually the source of this network model. By combining the locations of outage calls from customers, a rules engine is used to predict the locations of outages. For instance, since the distribution system is primarily tree-like or radial in design, all calls in particular area downstream of a fuse could be inferred to be caused by a single fuse or circuit breaker upstream of the calls. The outage calls are usually taken by call takers in a call center utilizing a customer information system (CIS). Another common way for outage calls to enter into the CIS (and thus the OMS) is by integration with an interactive voice response (IVR) system. The CIS is also the source for all the customer records which are linked to the network model. Customers are typically linked to the transformer serving their residence or business. It is important that every customer be linked to a device in the model so that accurate statistics are derived on each outage. Customers not linked to a device in the model are referred to as \\"fuzzies\\". More advanced automatic meter reading (AMR) systems can provide outage detection and restoration capability and thus serve as virtual calls indicating customers who are without power. However, unique characteristics of AMR systems such as the additional system loading and the potential for false positives requires that additional rules and filter logic must be added to the OMS to support this integration. Outage management systems are also commonly integrated with SCADA systems which can automatically report the operation of monitored circuit breakers and other intelligent devices such as SCADA reclosers. Another system that is commonly integrated with an outage management system is a mobile data system. This integration provides the ability for outage predictions to automatically be sent to crews in the field and for the crews to be able to update the OMS with information such as estimated restoration times without requiring radio communication with the control center. Crews also transmit details about what they did during outage restoration. It is important that the outage management system electrical model be kept up to current so that it can accurately make outage predictions and also accurately keep track of which customers are out and which are restored. By using this model and by tracking which switches, breakers and fuses are open and which are closed, network tracing functions can be used to identify every customer who is out, when they were first out and when they were restored. Tracking this information is the key to accurately reporting outage statistics. (P.-C. Chen, et al., 2014)  OMS benefits  OMS benefits include: * Reduced outage durations due to faster restoration based upon outage location predictions. * Reduced outage duration averages due to prioritizing * Improved customer satisfaction due to increase awareness of outage restoration progress and providing estimated restoration times. * Improved media relations by providing accurate outage and restoration information. * Fewer complaints to regulators due to ability to prioritize restoration of emergency facilities and other critical customers. * Reduced outage frequency due to use of outage statistics for making targeted reliability improvements.  OMS based distribution reliability improvements  An OMS supports distribution system planning activities related to improving reliability by providing important outage statistics. In this role, an OMS provides the data needed for the calculation of measurements of the system reliability. Reliability is commonly measured by performance indices defined by the IEEE P1366-2003 standard. The most frequently used performance indices are SAIDI, CAIDI, SAIFI and MAIFI. An OMS also support the improvement of distribution reliability by providing historical data that can be mined to find common causes, failures and damages. By understanding the most common modes of failure, improvement programs can be prioritized with those that provide the largest improvement on reliability for the lowest cost. While deploying an OMS improves the accuracy of the measured reliability indices, it often results an apparent degradation of reliability due to improvements over manual methods that almost always underestimate the frequency of outages, the size of outage and the duration of outages. To compare reliability in years before an OMS deployment to the years after requires adjustments to be made to the pre-deployment years measurements to be meaningful. References * Sastry, M.K.S.

The channel broadcasts regional coverage of professional sports events throughout New England with a major focus on Boston area teams, as well as several original analysis, magazine and entertainment programs. It is available on cable providers throughout Massachusetts, eastern and central Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island; it is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV. NBC Sports Boston, along with NBC owned and operated WBTS-CD (channel 15), Telemundo O&O; WNEU (channel 60), and New England Cable News (NECN), are all based at the NBCU Boston Media Center on B Street in Needham. History =Early history= NBC Sports Boston originally launched on November 6, 1981 as PRISM New England. A spin- off of the Philadelphia-based film and sports-oriented premium service PRISM, it was founded by that channel's parent company, Spectacor. Along with carrying entertainment programming, the network also served as the cable television home for the NHL's Hartford Whalers and the NBA's Boston Celtics, as well as various college sports teams. In late 1982, Spectacor sold PRISM New England to Cablevision Systems Corporation. On January 1, 1983, the network was rebranded as SportsChannel New England, becoming the second network of what would become the SportsChannel group (after SportsChannel New York). =As a Fox Sports Net outlet= On June 30, 1997, News Corporation and Liberty Media ‚Äì which had created a new group of regional sports networks, branded as Fox Sports Net, in November 1996, through News Corporation's partial acquisition of the Liberty-owned Prime Network ‚Äì purchased a 40% interest in Cablevision's sports properties including the SportsChannel networks (as part of a deal that included partial ownership of Madison Square Garden and its NBA and NHL team tenants, the New York Knicks and New York Rangers). Cablevision, News Corporation and Liberty Media formed the venture National Sports Partners to run the owned-and-operated regional networks. As part of a gradual rebranding of most of the SportsChannel networks that began that month (the lone exception being SportsChannel Florida, which did not become an owned-and-operated outlet until 2000), SportsChannel New England joined Fox Sports Net on January 28, 1998, officially rebranding as Fox Sports New England. That month, MediaOne acquired a 50% interest in the network. The channel was rebranded as Fox Sports Net New England in 2000, as part of a collective brand modification of the FSN networks under the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" banner. That year, AT&T; Corp. bought MediaOne, including its stake in the network; in January 2001, AT&T; proposed to sell the stake, along with its interest in seven other cable networks, in a filing with the Federal Communications Commission. Comcast acquired the stake in November 2002 as part of its merger with AT&T; Broadband. The network's name was shortened to FSN New England in 2004, through the de-emphasis of the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" brand by the regional networks. In later years, the network carried selected New York Mets games in parts of Connecticut that were not served by MSG or FSN New York (now MSG Plus), which then produced the games. =As a Comcast SportsNet outlet= In February 2005, Cablevision acquired News Corporation's interest in FSN New England, FSN New York, and FSN Chicago in a trade deal in which Fox sold its interest in Madison Square Garden and the arena's NBA and NHL team tenants in exchange for acquiring sole ownership of FSN Florida, FSN Ohio, and FSN's national programming and advertising division. Comcast retained its 50% stake in FSN New England; at the time, analysts speculated that Comcast would eventually acquire full control of the network for integration into its Comcast SportsNet group of regional sports networks. CSN New England logo, used from 2016 through October 2, 2017 On April 30, 2007, Comcast announced that it would purchase Cablevision's stakes in FSN New England and FSN Bay Area from Cablevision, giving it full ownership of FSN New England. The network was rebranded as Comcast SportsNet New England on October 1, 2007. CSN New England, along with the other Comcast SportsNet-branded networks, was revamped with a new logo and graphics package (similar to that first used by sister network Comcast SportsNet Bay Area after it dropped the FSN brand) in August 2008. With Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2011, Comcast SportsNet was also integrated into the new NBC Sports Group, culminating with the addition of the peacock logo and an updated graphics package to mirror that of its parent network. That year, the network reached an extension of their rights deal with the Boston Celtics that saw the team acquire a 20% equity stake in Comcast SportsNet New England. On August 6, 2014, satellite provider Dish Network dropped Comcast SportsNet New England in a dispute over a proposed increase in retransmission consent fees during carriage agreement negotiations. Comcast rebranded the network as NBC Sports Boston on October 2, 2017, as part of a larger rebranding of the Comcast SportsNet networks under the NBC Sports brand. Programming =Sports coverage= NBC Sports Boston holds the regional cable television rights to the NBA's Boston Celtics (the only remaining sports property that has aired its games on the network since its launch in 1981), the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (which first broadcast its games on the network from 1996 to 2007, before returning to the network in 2010), the Boston Cannons of Major League Lacrosse and the Maine Red Claws of the National Basketball Development League (which have aired its games on the network since the team's formation in 2011). Until 2012, Comcast SportsNet New England also carried programming distributed nationally by Fox Sports Networks in lieu of a regional FSN affiliate. This includes access to a variety of college sports, notably Pac-12 Conference basketball games on various nights, as well as Saturday telecasts of football games from the Pac-12 and Big 12 Conferences during their respective seasons. The channel also aired studio shows produced by Fox Sports Networks (such as The Best Damn Sports Show Period and FSN Final Score), prior to the premiere of the network's own sports news program, SportsNet Central, in December 2009. Comcast SportsNet New England, along with four other CSN networks, dropped FSN programming on August 1, 2012, after the NBC Sports Group could not reach a deal to continue carrying FSN programming. The network formerly carried games from the NHL's Hartford Whalers from its launch in 1981 until the team's relocation to North Carolina (as the Carolina Hurricanes) in 1997. The network also served as the television home of the Boston Breakers of the United States Football League, broadcasting the team's games that were not nationally televised by ABC or ESPN for one season in 1983. =Current and former original programming= * The Baseball Show (airs Sundays from 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. during baseball season) ‚Äì Hosted by Bob Neumeier with analysts Lou Merloni, Sean McAdam, Dan Shaughnessy, and Steve Buckley, it is a call-in program featuring studio discussions, and opinions and comments from viewers and listeners about the latest issues regarding the Boston Red Sox.

It is owned by Rhode Island Public Radio. On November 23, 2018, the FCC granted a construction permit for W275DA, an FM Translator station on 102.9 MHz, to simulcast the then-WRPA in the Providence area.FCC facility record for W275DA History The station went on the air in 1947 as WNAF; the call letters were changed to WDEM in 1949. It changed to WICE in 1952 to signify its broadcasting the Providence Reds hockey team. During the 1960s, WICE presented a top 40 music format. By the 1970s, WICE had switched to a news/talk format featuring Kurt Oden, who later served as an aide to Mayor Buddy Cianci. It was owned by Susquehanna Radio. It switched to Portuguese programming as WRCP in 1983. It changed to English public radio programming as WRNI in 1998. It changed to Spanish programming in 2011, and finally to the call sign WRPA in 2018. =As WICE= The station was officially renamed to WICE on February 30, 1952. The change was in reference to the ice the Reds skated on at the Rhode Island Auditorium where the studios were. In 1952, the station manager was Sumner Pearl who also hosted programs throughout the day. In the early days, WICE was full of sports content. WICE Sports Ace Chris Schenkel would broadcast a 'Feature Race of the Day' from Narragansett Park. They would also cover all the Providence Reds games both home and away. This made them competitive with the all powerful WPRO. 1953 fire On January 4, 1953, a small fire broke out in a storage closet where the WICE studios were located. Local announcer Sherm Strickhouser discovered the fire, and alerted the authorities. After the fire was extinguished, they found the body of 26 year-old popular local disc jockey, Jay Creedon. Creedon was scheduled to return to the air that morning after a four-week hiatus. He had slept the previous night in the storage room, falling asleep with a cigarette in his hand. =As an English-language public radio station= WRNI's logo from 1998 to 2008, when it was operated by Boston University. In the 1990s, a group of Rhode Islanders formed the Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio in order to bring a local public radio station to the state. At the time, Rhode Island was the only state in New England (traditionally one of the bedrocks of support for NPR) and one of only two in the entire country (the other being Delaware) that didn't have a full-service NPR station within its borders. Most of the state got at least a grade B signal from Boston's WGBH (with Providence itself receiving a city-grade signal) and WBUR. After a few years of looking, they found a partner in Boston University, owner of WBUR. BU agreed to buy WRCP for $1.9 million; the foundation conducted a statewide drive to help raise the funds. On May 1, 1998, WRCP's calls officially changed to WRNI, and the license was officially transferred to the WRNI Foundation, a separate fundraising group set up by WBUR to handle local underwriting. Even though BU doubled WRNI's transmission power from 5,000 to 10,000 watts, its signal was not strong enough to reach the southern and western portion of the state (though it provides a city-grade signal to Newport, southern Rhode Island's biggest city). Accordingly, in 1999, BU bought WERI in Westerly, which had been on the air since 1949. BU changed WERI's calls to WXNI, and made it a full-time satellite of WRNI. The station brought a city-grade NPR signal to southern Rhode Island for the first time ever. BU and WBUR had ambitious plans for WRNI at first. It moved WRNI from its longtime studio on Douglas Avenue to a state-of-the-art facility at Union Station. It also started a daily two-hour local news magazine, One Union Station.NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush It also had plans to set up a third station to fill the gaps in WXNI's 1,000-watt signal.Current.org  Struggle over WBUR's Rhode Island stations, 2004 However, budget problems brought on by the September 11, 2001 attacks forced One Union Station's cancellation. It was replaced with a one-hour news magazine that was canceled in 2004. At that point, WRNI's local operations were significantly cut back, with most of the station's staff either laid off or transferred to Boston. This resulted in WRNI's schedule becoming almost identical to that of WBUR. Controversy over sale On September 17, 2004, with no advance warning, WBUR Group general manager Jane Christo announced that WRNI and WXNI were being put on the market. She wouldn't give any specifics, only saying that it was time for Rhode Islanders to buy the stations if they wanted to keep NPR programming in the state. Indeed, WBUR claimed that it never intended to operate WRNI on a long-term basis, and had only intended to help develop it into a self-sustaining service. The reaction in Rhode Island was, not surprisingly, hostile. In an editorial, The Providence Journal said that WBUR had made numerous long-term commitments to WRNI, and claimed that if the station's local backers had to buy WRNI, it would be tantamount to buying the station twice. The announcement led state attorney general Patrick Lynch to open an investigation into WBUR and WRNI. On September 27, BU interim president Aram Chobanian delayed the sale of WRNI and WXNI, citing concerns raised by both Lynch and Rhode Island Governor Don Carcieri. Memos obtained by The Boston Globe revealed that WBUR felt the Rhode Island stations were money bleeders, and had decided to either lease or sell the stations at the earliest opportunity. The furor over the WRNI sale was one factor in Christo's resignation almost a month later.Current.org  Christo resigns at WBUR, 2004 In June 2005, BU took WRNI and WXNI off the market. It promised to hire a full-time general manager based in Providence, and also stepped up local news coverage. As a result, Lynch closed his investigation in November 2006. On March 21, 2007, WBUR announced that it was selling WRNI to Rhode Island Public Radio‚Äîformerly the Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio‚Äîfor $2 million. Rhode Island Public Radio also announced it was buying WAKX in Narragansett Pier from Davidson Media to serve as a repeater for WRNI in southern Rhode Island. WAKX, which signed on in 1989, had been a smooth jazz station. As part of the sale agreement, BU would continue to provide engineering and programming assistance to RIPR for five years. RIPR officially took control of WAKX on May 17, 2007, changing the call sign to WRNI-FM. The addition of WRNI-FM made WXNI 1230 AM redundant, and BU sold that station separately to Diponti Communications, which renamed it WBLQ. RIPR took control of WRNI on September 1, 2008. RIPR registered the domain name ripr.org on February 13, 2007; the site was live as of June 2007. =As a Spanish-language public radio station= On October 8, 2011, RIPR dropped its English-language public radio programming from the 1290 AM signal and brokered its airtime to Latino Public Radio. The move also made LPR eligible for Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding. LPR's programming had previously been heard part- time on The Wheeler School's WELH (88.1 FM); that station replaced WRNI as flagship of the Rhode Island Public Radio network, which also includes WNPN (89.3 FM) in Newport, WNPE (102.7) in Narragansett Pier, and WCVY (91.5 FM) in Coventry. With the end of LPR's five-year lease approaching in October 2016, RIPR elected to sell WRNI and, as part of the lease, gave LPR right of first refusal.Providence Journal; November 19, 2016 \\"Rhode Island‚Äôs Latino Public Radio in danger of going off the air\\" RIPR entered into an agreement to sell the station to LPR for $400,000 on August 11, 2017, with LPR being required to change the station's call letters; LPR requested the call sign WRPA. On February 15, 2018, a notice of non-consummation was filed and the sale to LPR nullified, however the FCC granted the call letter change to WRPA on February 28. On March 23, it was announced Latino Public Radio had requested termination of the lease, effective March 31, 2018. =Currently= At 12:04 a.m., April 1, 2018, WRPA shut down and Latino Public Radio programming was ended. At 9:30 a.m. on April 10, 2018, WRPA resumed broadcasting using a simulcast of WNPN. The license remains owned by Rhode Island Public Radio. , the station is up for sale.https://stationsale.com/wrpa-translator-cp-w275da- providence-ri/ The call letters were changed to WPPB on July 10, 2020.

Hesper was a wooden- hulled, single-screw, triple-masted, cargo ship built by the Bradley Transportation Company in Cleveland, Ohio. She was used to haul both iron ore and grain, two products important to Minnesota's economy at the time. Hesper was caught in a late-spring snowstorm on 4 May 1905, with a strong nor'easter with winds of 60 mph (97 km/hr) driving her off her intended course and smashing her into a reef that now marks the southwest end of the harbor in Silver Bay, Minnesota. The ship foundered and sank in about of water. The crew was able to escape in the ship's lifeboats, but the ship was a total loss. The wreck of Hesper is well preserved and lies in 30 to 48 feet (9 to 15 meters) of water about halfway down the west breakwall of the Silver Bay harbor. The hull is split apart at the turn of the bilge, and the port and starboard sides of the ship lie alongside and roughly parallel to the ceiling of the hull. The sides both contain timbers that were used to mount the decks, which are no longer present. The decks are presumed to have washed ashore after the ship sank. The aft end of the hull contains a number of long bolts that were used to mount the engine.

Background The late Canadian Graphic Designer Enrique Salazar.Enrique Salazar was a founding member of the BC chapter of the GDC in the 1970s and served as BC's National Representative. He was a dedicated and talented designer who shared his passion and knowledge of design through teaching at Capilano University as well as working in the commercial field running his own creative agency Salazar Graphics in partnership with his brother Santiago Salazar, A.K.A. Lisa Salazar. Unfortunately the industry lost Enrique to cancer in June 1985 and the Salazar Awards were created by GDC and founding sponsor Met Printers to continue on his passion and commitment to design and communications education. The Salazar brothers were born in Colombia and in 1960 their family moved to the United States, making their home in San Jose, California. Enrique attended West Valley College and hoped to eventually become an architect. In 1968, during the height of the war in Vietnam, he accepted a job offer as a draftsman at a new startup high-tech company in Vancouver, Canada. In the meantime, Santiago graduated from high school and enrolled at San Jose State University to study graphic design. Enrique eventually shifted his focus to graphic design as well and without any formal training, began to produce marketing materials for the company he worked for. One day he saw an ad for an in-house graphic designer at Finning Tractor, the largest Caterpillar dealer in North America, where he honed his skills and learned about print production. After Santiago's graduation in 1972, Enrique convinced him to move to Vancouver so they could start their own studio. Reluctant at first, Santiago eventually caved in to Enrique's persuasion, arriving in Vancouver in 1973. Salazar Graphics was founded the following year, with an office at the west end of Vancouver's Gastown district, which at the time had become the epicenter for graphic designers. In 1980, the Salazar brothers were introduced to the retiring head of the Graphic Design and Illustration program at Capilano University and were invited to develop a course, which they titled \\"Studio Production,\\" and the two brothers taught the course as a tag-team, alternating each week. For the fall semester in 1984, due to family business obligations, Santiago had to leave the teaching to Enrique. It was at the end of the semester Enrique's health began to deteriorate and resigned as instructor. Santiago returned to teaching the following year. Since 1956 the GDC has been dedicated to improving graphic design standards and practice, in the workplace and in schools, and the importance of nurturing design professionals and attracting young talent to the industry cannot be over-emphasized. This is the primary reason for events such as Salazar Awards. The Salazar Student Design Awards encourage and support students in taking their design education to a level that will better prepare them for professional practice. A judging committee of top design professionals review submissions and select winners and honourable mentions based on strategy and rationales provided, as well as the level of visual execution. Winning students and honourable mentions are promoted to the design, advertising and business communities through an awards evening and exhibit of their work. Speakers at recent Salazar awards ceremonies have included Coudal Partners founder Jim Coudal [2006], Rethink Creative Director Ian Grais [2007], legendary designer Stefan Sagmeister [2008] and Michael Osborne of MOD & Joey's Corner [2009]. Winners Previous notable winners have included Jim Skipp (1988), Kiky Kambylis (1989), Sean Carter (1990), Nancy Wu (1991), Oliver Oike (2000) and Don Williams (2002). 2006 winners included Andrew Clequin, Christopher Swift, Henry Huynh, Sherry Jang, Robyn Sommerville, Olga Gryb, Kathryn Wright, Bart Sciana, Yoonju Chung and Sanaz Afshar. 2007 winners included Carlos Guimaraes, Jeff Greenberg & Eric Wada, Jeff Kwok, Stefan Belavy, Ryan Uhrich & Marcos Ceravolo, Ross Milne, Chelsea McKenzie, Megan Brooks, Kim Ridgewell, Penelope Tse, Ashley Hostasek, Ryan Mah, Abi Huynh & Ross Milne, Terry Chau, Eric Arnold, Megan Seely, Ross Milne, Megan Brooks, Marty Chow and Eric Arnold 2013 winners include Daniel Gleiberman & Elena Syrovatkina from Emily Carr University for Motion & Video; Joan Gurney, Capilano University for Interactive; Alex Harvey-Wickens, Capilano University for Print; and Camille Segur, Capilano University for Brand Identity.

Thus the military campaign is also known as the \\"Emperor's Crusade\\" (echoing the name \\"Kings' Crusade\\" given to the Third Crusade).The Crusades, C. 1071-c. 1291 By Jean Richard, Jean Birrell, pg. 237 While his forces were already on their way to the Holy Land, Henry VI died before his departure in Messina on 28 September 1197. The emerging throne conflict between his brother Philip of Swabia and the Welf rival Otto of Brunswick made many higher-ranking crusaders return to Germany in order to protect their interests in the next imperial election. The nobles remaining on the campaign captured the Levant coast between Tyre and Tripoli before returning to Germany. The Crusade ended after the Christians captured Sidon and Beirut from the Muslims in 1198. Background On 2 October 1187 the Ayyubid sultan Saladin captured Jerusalem and large parts of the Crusader states. In an effort to reclaim the Outremer estates, the Third Crusade was launched by King Philip II of France, King Richard I of England, and Emperor Frederick I of the Holy Roman Empire in 1189. Frederick departed with a huge army, defeated a Seljuk contingent near Philomelion and captured Iconium, but then drowned in the G√∂ksu River near Silifke in Cilicia. Upon his death, Frederick's German crusading host, totaling perhaps 12,000 to 15,000 men, mostly disbanded and a much smaller contingent led by Frederick's son Duke Frederick VI of Swabia continued to the Holy Land, where they joined the Siege of Acre. The crusade ended in the 1192 Treaty of Ramla signed by Sultan Saladin and King Richard I, establishing a three-years armistice and allowing the Muslims to retain control over Jerusalem, while the Crusaders maintained Acre, Jaffa, and other key coastal cities. Henry and Pope Celestine, from Liber ad honorem Augusti by Peter of Eboli, 1196 Henry VI, elected King of the Romans since 1169, succeeded his father Frederick and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Celestine III in 1191. In his struggle with the Princes to enforce his succession, the tide turned in his favour when the returning crusader King Richard was captured in Austria and only released against an oath of allegiance and an enormous ransom. In 1194 Henry could assert the inheritance claims of his wife Constance by conquering the Kingdom of Sicily. By declaring a new Crusade to reconquer Jerusalem, Henry aimed at an agreement with Pope Celestine III to acknowledge his rule over Sicily. In 1195 the armistice concluded by King Richard ended. Sultan Saladin had already died in 1193 and a conflict over his succession raged in the Ayyubid lands. In view of these favourable developments, the emperor hoped to continue the momentum of the previous campaign. Henry VI decided to take advantage of his father's threat of force against the Byzantine Empire, affected by the rebellions in Serbia and Bulgaria as well as by Seljuk incursions. Emperor Isaac II Angelos had maintained close ties with the Sicilian usurper king Tancred of Lecce, but he was overthrown in April 1195 by his brother Alexios III Angelos. Henry took the occasion to exact tribute and had a threatening letter sent to Alexios III in order to finance the planned Crusade. Alexius immediately submitted to the tributary demands and exacted high taxes from his subjects to pay the Crusaders 5,000 pounds of gold. Henry also forged alliances with King Amalric of Cyprus and Prince Leo of Cilicia. Call for Crusade Babenberg pedigree, Klosterneuburg Monastery, During the Holy Week (March) of 1195, Emperor Henry made a pledge and at the Easter celebrations in Bari publicly announced the Crusade. Henry's original plan in April 1195 was for a force of 1,500 knights and 3,000 sergeants, but this total would be exceeded. In the summer he was travelling through Germany in order to gain supporters. Despite the stalemate of the Third Crusade, a large number of the nobles responded, among them: *Archbishop Conrad of Mainz, the Archchancellor of Germany, and Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen *Nine Bishops, including Wolfger of Passau, Conrad of Hildesheim *Five dukes: Henry of Brabant, Berthold of Merania, Frederick of Austria, his uncle Henry of M√∂dling and the emperor's cousin Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia *Various counts: including Henry V of the Rhine, Meinhard II of Gorizia, Eberhard of D√∂rnberg, Albert of Arneburg A large number of minor nobles also joined the Crusade and before long, according to Arnold von L√ºbeck in his Arnoldi Chronica Slavorum, a powerful military host of 60,000, including 7,000 German knights, was on its way. A contemporary chronicler gave a lower estimate of 4,000 knights and an unknown amount of infantry. German historian Claudia Naumann suggested in 1994 that the Crusade had 16,000 men, including 3,000 knights. Bretislaus III, Duke of Bohemia had agreed to join the Crusade at the Diet in Worms in December 1195, and planned to do so, until he fell ill and died on 15 or 19 June 1197. In March 1197 Henry proceeded to the Kingdom of Sicily. The crusaders embarked for Acre, while the emperor first had to suppress an armed revolt in Catania. A force of 3,000 Saxon and Rhenish troops in 44 ships under Count Palatine Henry V and Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen sailed from northern Germany and arrived in Messina in August, where they merged with the emperor's troops and sailed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Still in Sicily, out for hunting near Fiumedinisi in August, Emperor Henry fell ill with chills, possibly from malaria. He died on September 28 before he could set sail for the Holy Land. Campaign Reconquest of Beirut, Alexandre Hesse, 1842 On 22 September 1197, a substantial German army under the command of Archchancellor Conrad of Mainz and Marshal Henry of Kalden landed at Acre, where their presence aroused the displeasure of the French forces of Queen Isabella of Jerusalem. As the German Princes denied the authority of Henry of Kalden, they elected Duke Henry of Brabant their commander and the crusaders proceeded to Tyre, initiating a campaign to expel the Muslims from Beirut and to subject the Levant coast up to Tripoli. They captured the wealthy and important city of Sidon and on October 24 entered Beirut. With the support of the Princes, Emperor Henry's vassal King Amalric of Cyprus married Queen Isabella and was crowned King of Jerusalem (as Amalric II) in 1198. The crusaders continued their campaign and by reconquering the estates around Byblos Castle (Gibelet) restored the land link to the County of Tripoli. They even marched against Damascus and laid siege to Toron, when news of the emperor's death reached them. By July 1198, most of the nobles had returned homeRiley-Smith (1990) p.64 to get their fiefs confirmed by Henry's successor. The remaining crusaders concluded another armistice in June 1198 with the Ayyubid emir al-Adil I, who acknowledged the rule of King Amalric II over the reconquered lands. In his capacity as King of Jerusalem, Amalric II enfeoffed the Lordship of Beirut to John of Ibelin and the Lordship of Sidon to Reginald Grenier. On his way back to Germany, Archbishop Conrad of Mainz in January 1198 crowned Prince Leo of Cicilia as King of Armenia in Tarsus. Aftermath Overshadowed by Henry's death, the Crusade did not realize his high-flying ambitions. Nevertheless, the weakening of the Byzantine Empire persisted and established a basis for the Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. At the same time the originally intended reconquest of Jerusalem was abandoned, when the armistice with the Ayyubid dynasty was renewed for another six years. The German Princes later on concentrated on their land acquisitions in the territories of the Polabian Slavs initiated by the Wendish Crusade of 1147. The Teutonic Order, established during the Siege of Acre in 1190 and elevated to a chivalric order during the German Crusade in March 1198, played an important role in the German eastward expansion to Prussia and the adjacent Baltic region in the 13th century.

The movie follows the early artistic career of Marla Olmstead, a young girl from Binghamton, New York who gains fame first as a child prodigy painter of abstract art, and then becomes the subject of controversy concerning whether she truly completed the paintings herself or did so with her parents' assistance and/or direction. The film was bought by Sony Pictures Classics in 2007 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. Taglines * \\"Inspiration or Manipulation? You Decide.\\" * \\"American dream or art world scheme?\\" Summary Marla's father, an amateur painter, describes how Marla watches him paint, wants to help, and is given her own canvas and supplies. A friend asks to hang Marla's pictures in his coffee shop and is surprised when people ask to buy them. A local newspaper reporter, Elizabeth Cohen, writes a piece about Marla, after first asking her parents if they really want her to do so. Cohen's story is picked up by The New York Times, and Marla becomes a media celebrity, with appearances on television and shows at galleries in New York and Los Angeles. Sales of her work earn over $300,000. The tone of the documentary turns with a scene of Marla's parents watching a February 2005 report by CBS News' 60 Minutes II that questions whether Marla painted the works attributed to her. 60 Minutes enlisted the help of Ellen Winner, a child psychologist who studies cognition in the arts and gifted children. Seeing video images of some of the paintings attributed to Marla, Winner initially reacts positively, stating: \\"It's absolutely beautiful. You could slip it into the Museum of Modern Art and absolutely get away with it.\\" The 60 Minutes reporter, Charlie Rose, then shows Winner what he describes as \\"50 minutes of videotape shot by us and by Marla's parents.\\" After seeing this footage, Winner states: \\"This is eye-opening to me, to see her actually painting.\\" Rose asks her how this is \\"eye-opening.\\" Winner responds: \\"Because she's not doing anything that a normal child wouldn't do. She's just kind of slowly pushing the paint around.\\" Rose then states that after \\"our interview,\\" the Olmsteads agreed to permit CBS crews to set up a hidden camera in their home to tape their daughter painting a single piece in five hours over the course of a month. When Winner reviewed the tapes, the psychologist said, \\"I saw no evidence that she was a child prodigy in painting. I saw a normal, charming, adorable child painting the way preschool children paint, except that she had a coach that kept her going.\\" Winner also indicated that the painting created before CBS's hidden camera looked \\"less polished than some of Marla's previous works.\\" Asked to explain the difference, Winner states: \\"I can only speculate. I don't see Marla as having made, or at least completed, the more polished looking paintings, because they look like a different painter. Either somebody else painted them start to finish, or somebody else doctored them up. Or, Marla just miraculously paints in a completely different way than we see on her home video.\\"New Questions About Child Prodigy from 60 Minutes II Marla's parents film her creating a second work, Ocean, but Bar-Lev is not fully convinced. A couple are shown considering the purchase of Ocean. The woman complains that Ocean does not look like the other works by Marla. They buy it anyway. In a slide show, Bar-Lev compares Ocean with the 60 Minutes piece and then with several other works attributed to Marla. Viewers are left to make their own judgments. The film also raises questions about the nature of art, especially abstract expressionism, the nature of the documentary process, and the perception that the media imparts fame to subjects only to later subject them to intense scrutiny and criticism. Reception In his October 2007 review of Bar-Lev's film, Roger Ebert stated: \\"My own verdict as an outsider is, no, Marla didn't paint those works, although she may have applied some of the paint. In the last analysis, I guess it all reduces to taste and instinct. Some paintings are good, says me, or says you, and some are bad. Some paintings could be painted by a child, some couldn't be.\\"Roger Ebert's review of the film at rogerebert.suntimes.com In his review of Bar-Lev's film, LA Weekly's art critic Doug Harvey reveals a different viewpoint. \\"The works created by Marla on camera are different from some of her canvasses, similar to others and better than many.

He attended the University of Notre Dame, and has an MA in Theatre from SUNY Stony Brook. Having lived in New Orleans and Key West, Florida, Reese now divides his time between St. Petersburg, Florida, and Paris, France. Reese's first novel, The Book of Shadows (William Morrow and Company, 2002), appeared on the extended New York Times bestseller list. It tells the story of Herculine, a French hermaphrodite born on the Breton coast in 1806. Reese styled the book in accord with the conventions of both the nineteenth-century novel and Gothic fiction. Indeed, Reese cites the early Gothicists as his prime models, and The Book of Shadows incorporates supernatural elements with a mix of history and horror. Herculine's story continued in The Book of Spirits (Wm. Morrow & Co., 2004) and concluded in The Witchery (Wm. Morrow & Co., 2006). In the former novel, Herculine arrives in Richmond, Virginia, in the years prior to the American Civil War and befriends a young Edgar Allan Poe and his sister, Rosalie. Events soon take Herculine to Havana, Cuba, and the Florida Keys, where The Witchery brings the Herculine Trilogy to a close. HarperCollins released Reese's The Dracula Dossier in October, 2008. Modeled on Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula, the novel imagines an encounter between Stoker himself and Francis J. Tumblety, a real-life suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders. Reese's books have been published in Russian, Romanian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, and Spanish.

Plot A recent transplant from California, Dr. Paula Spencer has just lost her husband and is about to begin her new job at a local hospital. While she is there, a seemingly loving mother, Monica Shaw, brings her son, Eric, in for treatment for his illness. But Dr. Spencer suspects that there is something wrong, and theorizes that Monica is deliberately and abusively making her son sick all the time so that she could have him admitted to the hospital for all of the attention that it gives her. However, hospital administrators are skeptical, and when Eric's young roommate also develops a similar illness, it only serves to make them even more dismissive. Adding to Dr. Spencer's stress is her troubled relationship with rebellious teenage daughter, Amanda, who is still grieving over the loss of her father and trying to fit in at a new school. To top it off, the two are later victims of a robbery by the woman Dr. Spencer hired as a housekeeper, whose take included some irreplaceable jewelry Amanda had received as gifts from her late father. When Dr. Spencer decides to ban Monica from being around her ill son and get child services to help him, Monica gets back by trying to get her and the hospital sued. Some of the other employees at the hospital board disagree with Dr. Spencer's diagnosis of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy by thinking she is overreacting. Even when Monica is kept away from Eric, he is getting worse and no better. With what seems like the whole hospital against her, Dr. Spencer takes on the help of a lawyer and the case goes to court. The court case determines whether social services will take care of the son or whether Monica can keep the child. However, Dr. Spencer believes that losing the court case will mean Eric's death. At first, things seem to be going in Monica's favor. However, an unexpected break occurs when a young patient tells Amanda (who works as a candy striper at the hospital) that she saw Monica in Eric's room the night before, thus violating the restraining order against her. The next day in court, the prosecution drops a bombshell with the revelation that between 1989 and 1994, while he and his mother lived in Seattle, Eric had been admitted to various hospitals with unexplained abdominal cramps a total of twenty-six times, which was eventually diagnosed as laxative abuse. Furthermore, it is revealed that back in 1982, Monica had a child out of wedlock, who also died of laxative abuse when he was only 18 months old. The revelation of this fact prompts Monica to have a breakdown on the witness stand and results in her losing custody of Eric, who is placed in the care of his grandmother. Despite her misgivings, satisfied that she had saved Eric's life, Dr. Spencer now realizes she also needs to improve her relationship with Amanda, telling her she loves her and promising to change.

At one point, it was compatible with the client for Second Life but compatibility has waned for several years. Features OpenSimulator is written in C# and is designed to be easily expanded through the use of plugin modules. OpenSimulator can operate in one of two modes: standalone or grid mode. In standalone mode, a single process handles the entire simulation. In grid mode, various aspects of the simulation are separated among multiple processes, which can exist on different machines. OpenSimulator uses loadable modules for most of its functionality. These loadable modules can be independently developed to add functionality to the server. OpenSimulator currently uses a modified Second Life protocol for client to server communication, and requires retrofitting to the Second Life client in order to connect. Interoperability with Second Life protocols was once a design goal since 2007. Interoperability with Second Life was no longer a design goal as of OpenSimulator Community Conference 2015. During OpenSimulator Community Conference 2018, the core developers announced they will not maintain compatibility with Linden Lab's Second Life Protocols, and will change them to fix and change whatever they need. OpenSim has a number of features not available in Second Life. These include extensions to the scripting language that enable saving and retrieval of text data to avatar inventory in notecard format and the creation and management of non-player characters (NPCs). OpenSim also uses an architecture known as \\"Hypergrid\\", which allows users to teleport between multiple OpenSim-based virtual worlds by providing a hyperlinked map which indexes public grids. This allows for public grids to retain teleportation links to each other without having to be on the same grid. The number of hypergrid enabled opensimulator grids fluctuates.

Gozen is assumed to be the daughter of Dota Masahisa, also known as Tsuchida Masahisa, a samurai possibly descended from the Rokkaku clan, but this is unconfirmed. Gozen was married to Oda Nobuhide, a deputy shugo of Owari Province and the head of the powerful Oda clan. Gozen the mother of Nobunaga, his three brothers, Nobuyuki, Nobukane and Hidetaka; and two of his sisters, Oinu and Oichi. According to rumors, Gozen did not like her eldest son Nobunaga, notorious in Owari for his eccentric and unconventional behavior, and instead preferred his well-mannered younger brother, Nobuyuki. When Nobuhide died in 1551, Gozen moved to Suemori Castle to live with Nobuyuki, and supported him in the succession crisis that occurred. Although Nobunaga was the legitimate heir as head of the Oda clan, Nobuyuki and other family members plotted against his succession. When Nobuyuki attempted to usurp Nobunaga but failed, Gozen stepped in and asked Nobunaga to take mercy on his brother, which he accepted and turned his attention to other rivals. However, Nobuyuki eventually tried to usurp Nobunaga again and, this time, Nobunaga killed him and destroyed Suemori Castle in the process.

A bill introduced by McClendon required would-be used auto salesmen and auto repair shop owners to ask the Metro Council for permission before opening a new shop, by creating a site plan that the council could then sign off on. =Votes= Amanda McClendon voted to raise pay rates for city council members from $6,900 to $15,000, the vice mayoral salary from $8,900 to $17,000, and the mayoral salary from $75,000 to $136,500. On the third reading, she voted for the proposal for a new ballpark for the Nashville Sounds, which included provisions for hotels, condos, shops and other businesses on the land adjacent to the stadium.

He spent most of his career in Austria and Bohemia, where he wrote both sacred and secular music. Biography Regnart was born at Douai, one of five brothers. His first documented appearance is in 1560 as a tenor at the Hofkapelle in Prague under Habsburg ruler Archduke Maximilian; Regnart claimed to have worked there since 1557. In 1564 his first works were published; he moved to Vienna and then Italy, where he studied from 1568 to 1570. The first fruits of these studies, Il primo libro delle canzone italiane, would be published in 1574, with many subsequent volumes to follow. In November 1570 he became an instructor for Maximilian's chapel choir, and upon Maximilian's death, Emperor Rudolf II hired him as a member of his Hofkapelle. It was in the 1570s that his volumes of three-voice Teutsche Lieder (German songs) appeared, printed by the Gerlachs of Nuremberg; they sold very well, were reprinted several times, and were arranged in tablature by several composers. In October 1579, he became vice-Kapellmeister, succeeding Alard du Gaucquier; the next year, Orlandus Lassus gave his name as a replacement for Antonio Scandello's position as Kapellmeister in Saxony, but Regnart did not accept the position, preferring to remain employed under the Habsburgs. However, in 1582, Archduke Ferdinand asked him to replace Alexander Utendal as vice-Kapellmeister, and he accepted, moving to Innsbruck in April 1582. In 1584, Regnart produced music for a comedy written by the Archduke, though this is now lost. On New Year's Day 1585, Regnart became Kapellmeister, and revamped the court's musical activities to great success, hiring many new Dutch and Italian singers and becoming quite wealthy himself. In 1588, Regnart published a collection of motets which displayed his support for Catholic reform. In 1590, Regnart and three of his four brothers, all of whom were accomplished musicians, published a joint collection of motets. Ferdinand had planned to make him a noble for his efforts, but died before he could do so; Archduke Matthias, his successor, completed the process in 1596. When Ferdinand died, his Hofkapelle was dissolved, and Regnart moved from Innsbruck back to Prague in 1596, where he became vice-Kapellmeister under Monte until his death in 1599. Regnart's works were regularly anthologized well into the 17th century, and his music was held in high regard by such theorists as Michael Praetorius and Jacob Burmeister. The first modern edition of his works was completed by Richard Eitner in 1895; a new edition was published by Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae in the 1970s.

Fidelity, always considered a strong contender to buy Mariner, bought another large suburban chain of weeklies, News-Transcript Group, in late 1994, fueling speculation that a deal for Mariner was close behind.

Boston Herald, November 23, 1994. The deal was not struck until early 1995, however. Fidelity's subsidiary, Community Newspaper Company, purchased Mariner for an undisclosed sum. At the time, CNC chairman William Elfers said Mariner \\"sort of fills out the map,\\" giving CNC an uninterrupted belt of papers surrounding Boston, from Cape Cod through MetroWest to the Massachusetts North Shore. The Mariner purchase raised CNC's weekly circulation to 1,018,000.Nutile, Tom. \\"Fidelity Unit Buys South Shore Papers\\". Boston Herald, April 8, 1995.

The plant is locally known as Niando.Dr. Duke's Database Description Alchornea floribunda is a large, straggly shrub that grows into a bush about tall. Uses This plant has many traditional uses. The leaves are sometimes cooked and eaten as a vegetable and may be eaten with meat or fish as an antidote to poison. They are also consumed as a remedy for ovarian problems and gastro- intestinal disorders. A decoction of the dried leaves is used to treat diarrhoea and the leaves are pulped to promote the healing of wounds. The dried leaves and fibrous root scrapings are used as a substitute for tobacco. The powdered rootbark is highly prized in traditional medicine as a stimulating intoxicant and aphrodisiac. This plant is preferentially used by chimpanzees in making tools for catching termites in the Dja Faunal Reserve in south eastern Cameroon. The animals hunt through the forest for the shrub and make short poles out of it. Thicker poles about half a metre long are used to dig into and disturb the termite mound, and thinner, flexible poles are inserted for the angry termites to climb onto. The chimpanzees then scoop the termites clinging to their fishing rods into their mouths.

Friedlaender was born in Berlin as the son of Carl Friedlaender (1817‚Äì1876), a professor of economics. His grandfather was Nathan Friedlaender (died 1830), a Berlin physician and university lecturer. Among his siblings was Immanuel Friedlaender (1871‚Äì1948), a distinguished volcanologist. He studied mathematics, physics, botany, and physiology in Berlin, earning a Ph.D. in zoology in 1888. As a well-to-do donor, he supported the anarchist journal Kampf and published in the journal Der Sozialist. He gave substantial financial support to Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (Wissenschaftlich-humanit√§res Komitee, or WhK) in Berlin. The primary goal of the WhK was to work against Paragraph 175 of the Imperial Penal Code, which criminalized \\"unnatural vice\\" between males. The WhK assisted defendants in criminal trials, conducted public lectures, and gathered signatures on a petition for the repeal of the law. It found some parliamentary support for its law reform efforts in the Social Democratic Party. With Adolf Brand and ten others, Friedlaender founded the homosexual organization called Gemeinschaft der Eigenen (GdE), usually translated as Community of the Special, in 1903. The word Eigenen can mean both \\"peculiar, distinctive, odd\\" (as in Oddfellows) and \\"owned, possessed\\", and the GdE's name was inspired in part by Max Stirner's libertarian philosophy of \\"self-ownership\\" or autonomy. The GdE repudiated Hirschfeld's understanding of homosexuality in a transgender spectrum and instead emphasized the masculinity of male-male sexuality, as did Andr√© Gide in 1924 in his Corydon. Some members of the GdE advocated the classical Greek practice of having a relationship with a younger man while being married. The GdE also spurned Hirschfeld's efforts at law reform and coalition-building with the Social Democrats and the feminist movement, adopting instead a diffusely anarchist outlook inspired by Stirner's individualism and the sweeping cultural criticism of Friedrich Nietzsche. Friedlaender nonetheless maintained his membership in the WhK until 1906, when he broke with Hirschfeld and founded a third gay organization named \\"Secession from the WhK\\". Later renamed \\"League for Manly Culture\\", this organization folded shortly after Friedlaender's death by suicide on 21 June 1908 in Berlin. Friedlaender wrote several books on different themes. His work Die Renaissance des Eros Uranios, which called for the revival of \\"Greek love\\", had an important influence on Hans Bl√ºher.

After the success of the play Sita Swayamvar Vishnudas Bhave staged plays on episodes of the Ramayana. He traveled a lot with his troupes for the plays. He also ventured into puppet shows. Vishnudas Bhave died on 9 August 1901. In Maharashtra the theatrical activity began in 1843 with Vishnudas Amrut Bhave's Sanglikar Natak Mandali. This drama company was influenced by the English plays. Vishnudas Bhave was an extremely gifted scholar - playwright, director and able organiser. A drama school was also set up in Sangli. Vishnudas Bhave came to Mumbai in 1853 and in the beginning he staged his \\"Khel-Akhyan\\" (play-narrations in verse) and plays in the wada of Shri Vishvanath Shimpi in the Girgaum locality of the city. The stories of his plays were rooted in Sanskrit mythological and religious literature. Songs and music were the strengths of Vishnudas Bhave's dramas. His play Sita Swayamvar became very popular and received much encomium. For the most part, Bhave's plays were one-man shows, with other cast playing strictly supporting and secondary roles only when their presence was needed. The tradition of full-fledged drama was revived much later in 1880 by Annasaheb Kirloskar, who is credited more often than Bhave as the pioneer of Marathi theatre. The Maharaja of Sangli Chintamanrao Appa Saheb Patwardhan gave his patronage and much encouragement to Vishnudas Bhave, who had extended his drama activity from Mumbai to Pune also. The history of Marathi Theater records that \\"Bhave produced plays in Marathi with music composed on Karnataki base. His play was much admired by the Governor's Secretary... religious spirit, scientific singing by a sort of chorus in the midst of dialogues by other characters, crude dances and quaint costumes and make-up and certain skillful sword-play were their outstanding qualities. One has to remember that the audience was very devotional in character\\". Besides Vishnudas Bhave's company other drama companies also came into existence, chief among them being Mumbaikar Natak Mandali, Amarchand Wadikar Natak Mandali, and Chaulwadi Hindu Natak Mandali. The plays by these drama companies attracted large audiences. Before 1843 in Tamil Nadu, Tanjore Maratha king Raja Shahaji Bhonsle had written plays, which were performed in the court and the temple. It was after 1843 that the Marathi theater began to progress. University education had begun in Maharashtra. In 1868 Vinayak Kirti entered the Marathi Theater with his historical drama Madhavrao Peshwa. The plays by Vishnudas Bhave and later playwrights were distinguished by excessive prominence to songs and music but Vinayak Kirti's Madhavrao Peshwa had absolutely no songs or musical recitals; instead the whole drama was acted with dialogues which were totally in prose. Here the Marathi drama branches off in two directions - Prose Plays and Verse Plays. Now the Marathi Theater was on its un-interrupted march.

Fasque was the property of the Ramsays of Balmain, and the present house was completed around 1809, replacing an earlier house. It was purchased in 1829 by Sir John Gladstone, 1st Baronet, father of Thomas Gladstone and William Ewart Gladstone, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who often stayed there. Fasque was a family home of the Gladstones until the 1930s, and was open to the public during the last quarter of the 20th century. In 2010 Fasque House was bought by Fasque House Properties Ltd and restoration work was begun. Etymology The name comes from the Gaelic word fasgadh, meaning \\"safety\\", or \\"dwelling place\\", and for reasons of potential tautology, \\"house\\" was never officially added. The name is a baroque, eighteenth-century corruption of the original Gaelic word. History A previous house, known as Fasque, or Faskie, was located roughly north of the present site. In about the 1750s, Sir Alexander Ramsay, 6th Baronet of Balmain, who had been a local Member of Parliament, planted the beech avenues that survive today. William Adam (1689‚Äì1748) prepared a plan for the house which is illustrated in his Vitruvius Scoticus, although it was never executed. By 1790, the house was growing increasingly prone to damp, and was demolished only forty years after completion. Sir Alexander, by then known as Alexander Ramsay-Irvine, died without heir in 1806, and the estate passed to his nephew, Alexander Burnett, who was made a baronet in 1806, and adopted the Ramsay surname. Although begun by Sir Alexander Ramsay-Irvine, the current house was not completed until about 1809. Approximately ¬£30,000 was spent on the project. The house took over ten years to construct, with contemporary guide books describing its central hallway being open to the elements, as the world's largest indoor double spiral staircase was being constructed at the back of the hall. Following his death in May 1810, the younger Alexander's 2nd. son, also Alexander Ramsay, inherited the estate and the baronetcy, and kept Fasque for 19 years before having to sell it in the face of rising costs of its upkeep. =Fasque under the Gladstones= In 1829, the house was sold for ¬£80,000 to John Gladstone, a Scottish merchant from Liverpool whose family (originally called Gledstanes) had been farmers in Biggar, before becoming wine merchants in Leith in the years following 1745. John Gladstone built up a business empire in property and international trade that by the 1820s had made him extremely wealthy. Through his estates in the West Indies, by the end of plantation slavery in the British colonies in 1833 Gladstone was one of Britain's biggest owners of enslaved people. He received ¬£106,769 in compensation (equivalent to ¬£ in ) under the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 for the 2,508 slaves he owned across nine plantations, more than any single other plantation owner. Following the death of their eldest daughter, Anne, in 1829, it took four years for the Gladstones to move up to the new property, from the now-demolished Seaforth House on the shores of the Mersey. In the winter of 1833, John, his wife Anne McKenzie, and their youngest daughter Helen, moved into Fasque for the first time. Their arrival coincided with one of the worst spells of weather ever recorded in Kincardineshire, with many of the trees to the north of the house (which had been planted originally in 1745) being blown down in high winds. The cold and the damp of the new house had a detrimental effect on Anne McKenzie Gladstone's health, and she died in 1835. Ten years later, in 1845, the Baronetcy of Fasque and Balfour was bestowed upon the elderly Sir John Gladstone, and to commemorate this, he built the Fasque Episcopalian Church in the grounds of the house, which is still used to this day. In its first decade, the Church also saw the burial of one of William Ewart Gladstone's offspring who died in childhood, and in the same year as its founding. In December 1851, Sir John Gladstone died, passing the house on to his oldest son, Thomas, the eldest brother of William. Thomas's sibling rivalry had been strong over the years, but now, as the second Baronet (and from 1876, Lord Lieutenant of Kincardineshire), Thomas Gladstone and his wife Louisa Fellows, a relative of Queen Victoria, ran Fasque as an effective house for nearly 40 years, adding servants' quarters to the building itself, along with a school in the grounds. During that time, William Ewart Gladstone (who had come into possession of Hawarden Castle in north Wales, through his wife's family, the Glynns) visited his elder brother many times, and practised his hobbies of walking and tree-felling across the moors of the estate. The estate lands had slowly expanded during Thomas's tenure to encompass , bordering Balmoral to the north. Sir Thomas died in 1889, passing the Baronetcy on to his eldest son John, a bachelor soldier, who came home to run the estate with his sister Mary in the 1890s. After Thomas' death, William did not visit his nephew's estate again, and himself died in May 1898. Fasque House remained a working home until 1932, when Lady Mary, who had survived her brother John by six years, passed on. At this point, Fasque House became disused, with much of the furniture covered with sheets, and rooms locked up for decades. The estate itself operated as before, but the main house was empty, although it remained \\"immaculately well preserved\\". Eventually, the Baronetcy passed through various family lines to end up with the 7th Baronet, Sir William Gladstone, great-grandson of the prime minister, and a former Chief Scout. In 1978, Sir William's younger brother, the naturalist Peter Gladstone, re-decorated Fasque, apparently whitewashing almost every wall surface himself, and opened it to the public for the first time in the September of that year, partly capitalising on the then-current popularity of the TV show Upstairs Downstairs. Fasque House remained open to summer visitors for over two decades, with the house's east wing almost entirely open to the public, and the west wing providing a home for Peter's family. A large auction sale of items from the house gained much publicity when it was held in the grounds in 1997. Peter died in 2000, with the estate now being run by Charles Gladstone, son of Sir William, the 7th Baronet. In 2003, the house was closed to the public, and since then specially arranged coach parties and wedding services have also been discontinued. =Recent developments= In August 2007, Fasque House was sold to a local developer who intended to convert the building into flats. However, it was quickly put back on the market, with an asking price of ¬£1.9 million. In May 2009 it was still being marketed, though at the reduced price of ¬£1m. In 2010 Fasque House was bought by Fasque House Properties Ltd, and a complete restoration of the house was begun. The building's use as a wedding venue was reinstated, alongside conference facilities and cottage rentals. This sale did not affect the Fasque and Glen Dye Estate, which is still owned by the Gladstone family. Architecture The house is a large sandstone building, in a symmetrical castellated style, with octagonal towers at the centre and corners of the main facade. The structure remains relatively unchanged since its completion. Sir John Gladstone added a third storey to the central tower in 1830, and built the portico of rusticated pillars in the 1840s. The drawing room was expanded in 1905, and some servants' quarters were added before the beginning of the First World War. Innovative use of electricity meant that Fasque was possibly the first house in Scotland to be lit by electric lights, and had an electric buzzer system as early as 1890. It was also noted for having innovative firefighting and health and safety equipment in the 1920s. The house is a category A listed building. Current management The property is managed by Inverlochy Castle Management International. ICMI also manages the luxury hotels Cromlix House in Perthshire, Greywalls Hotel & Chez Roux in East Lothian and Inverlochy Castle Hotel in Fort William.

Well known within the Hungarian borders for his vast influence on postwar Hungarian poetry, Pilinszky's style includes a juxtaposition of Roman Catholic faith and intellectual disenchantment. His poetry often focuses on the underlying sensations of life and death; his time as a prisoner of war during the Second World War and later his life under the communist dictatorship furthered his isolation and estrangement. Born in a family of intellectuals in 1921, Pilinszky went on to study Hungarian literature, law, and art history at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, Budapest, in 1938. Although he failed to complete his studies, it was during this same year that his first works of poetry were published in several varying literary journals. In 1944 he was drafted into the army; his unit being ordered to follow the retreating German allies, he arrived at Harbach, a small village in Germany, after a march of several weeks. Adrift in Germany, he witnessed several camps before he could return to Hungary after the end of the war, most notably the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. What he saw in the camps was an experience he never forgot and later commemorated in a great number of poems, most notably, (\\"KZ oratory\\"), (\\"Passion of Ravensbr√ºck\\"), , etc. Following the publication of his first body of work in 1946, (\\"Trapeze and Bars\\"), he was awarded the Baumgarten Prize in 1947. While Trap√©z √©s korl√°t consists of only 18 poems, it established Pilinszky as a major poetic force in Hungary. His next publication, 1959's (\\"On the third day\\"), was not released for over 10 years as a result of his being labeled ‚Äúpessimistic‚Äù by the ruling Hungarian Communist Party in the 1950s. Harmadnapon contains his poem (\\"Apocrypha\\"), considered his chef-d'oeuvre, which many see as one of the highest peaks of Hungarian poetry. The poem has the return of the prodigal son to his parents in its center, and summarises Pilinszky's poetic world from his experiences in the lagers to his alienation and the painful absence of God from the world. From 1960 to 1970, he traveled the United States and Europe taking part in several poetry readings. In 1971 he was awarded the J√≥zsef Attila Prize for his collection entitled (\\"Metropolitan Icons\\"). His monumental and visionary poems gave way to short, epigrammatic verses over time. 1972 saw the publication of (\\"Splinters\\"), followed by (\\"D√©nouement\\") in 1974. His last collection, (\\"Crater\\") was published in 1975, containing both new poems and the majority of his rather short, but extremely substantial and concise oeuvre rearranged in cycles. He was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1980 before returning to Budapest where he died of a heart attack in 1981. Pilinszky lead a very reserved private life. Eventually, he married a French woman, Ingrid Ficheux, 11 months before his death. His poems were translated into several languages; most notably, his English translator was Ted Hughes (in collaboration with J√°nos Csokits), while most French translations were made by his friend Pierre Emmanuel.

It is native to the Central African Republic, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania. Taxonomy Though it is formally classified as P. t. schweinfurthii, Colin Groves of the Australian National University argues that there is enough variation between the northern and southern populations of this population of chimpanzees to be split into two subspecies instead of one; the northern population as P. t. schweinfurthii and the southern population as P. t. marungensis. Threats and conservation The 2007 IUCN Red List classified them as Endangered. Although the common chimpanzee is the most abundant and widespread of the non-human great apes, recent declines in East Africa are expected to continue due to hunting and loss of habitat. Because chimpanzees and humans are physiologically very similar, chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans. If not properly managed, research and tourism also presents a risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees. This subspecies has been extensively studied by Dr. Jane Goodall at Gombe Stream National Park. Physical description Adult chimpanzees in the wild weigh between . Males can measure up to and females up to in height. The chimpanzee's body is covered with coarse black hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Both of its thumbs and its big toes are opposable, allowing a precision grip. Habitat A nest on a tree where chimpanzees sleep overnight The chimpanzee spends time both in trees and on the ground, but usually sleeps in a tree, where it builds a nest for the night. They once inhabited most of this region, but their habitat has been dramatically reduced in recent years. Behaviour and ecology A group of chimpanzees grooming Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time traveling in small parties of just a few individuals. The eastern chimpanzee is both arboreal and terrestrial and spend its nights in the trees, while most of its daytime hours are spent on the ground. Chimpanzees walk using the soles of their feet and their knuckles, and they can walk upright for short distances. Common chimpanzees are 'knuckle walkers', like gorillas, in contrast to the quadrupedal locomotion (a form of land animal locomotion using four legs) of orangutans and bonobos known as 'palm walkers' who use the outside edge of their palms. When confronted by a predator, chimpanzees will react with loud screams and use any object they can get against the threat. The leopard is the chimpanzee's main natural predator, but they have also fallen prey to lions. =Diet= Male chimpanzee with its prey, a bushbuck Like humans, chimpanzees are omnivorous, meaning their diet consists of plants and animals. Some of the foods a chimpanzee will eat include seeds, fruits, leaves, bark, insects such as termites and small prey. Chimpanzees will often use a twig as a tool to help them reach termites or ants in nests and have been seen using sticks to hunt other small mammals. There are also instances of organized hunting. In some cases, such as the killing of leopard cubs, this primarily seems to be a protective effort, since the leopard is the main natural predator of the common chimpanzee. However, common chimpanzees sometimes band together and hunt Western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius) for meat. Isolated cases of cannibalism have also been documented.

Although Titov's works are not widely known today, he was famous during his lifetime, and his importance was acknowledged in Russia by both pre-revolutionary and Soviet musicologists.Dolskaya-Ackerly, 206. Biography The scant biographical materials indicate that Titov was born in the 1650s. He joined Tsar Fedor's choir, the Gosudarevy Pevchie Diaki (–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä–µ–≤—ã –ü–µ–≤—á–∏–µ –î—å—è–∫–∏, The Tsar's Singers) when he was in his twenties; his salary is recorded in 1678. He quickly rose to prominence as both singer and composer. In the 1680s he collaborated with Simeon Polotsky (a famed churchman, man of letters and tutor to the children of Tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich), composing musical settings of Polotsky's psalter and an almanac of sacred poetry. In the 1680s Titov also joined Tsar Ivan's choir. When Tsar Fedor died in 1682, Titov retained his position in Tsar Ivan's choir. Tsar Ivan died in 1696 and the choir was disbanded in 1698. It is not known precisely what happened next to Titov. He may have taken up a position as choir master in a church of the Moscow Kremlin and/or head of a music school in Moscow. Nothing is known of his last years, except that he wrote some compositions associated with the Battle of Poltava in 1709 and died soon after that.Dolskaya-Ackerly, 207. Style Titov wrote more than 200 compositions, all of them vocal music. They include complete settings of Divine Services (Sluzhby Bozhie, –°–ª—É–∂–±—ã –ë–æ–∂–∏–µ) and a psalter (by Simeon Polotsky), as well as numerous vocal concertos for feast days. His works range from short, three-voice pieces to large-scale compositions for 12- and 24-voice choirs. Titov was one of the most important followers of Nikolay Diletsky's Idea grammatiki musikiiskoi (1679), an influential treatise on composition.Abraham, Grove. Znamenny Chant was another important influence on Titov's work: he even wrote a Service setting based entirely on the chant. In Titov's music the text is the most important element, as it defines both the overall form and the shape of the melodic lines, sometimes resulting in accomplished word-painting.Dolskaya-Ackerly, 214. The musical language is largely tonal; melodic lines are treated individually in horizontal manner, with many motivic ornaments. Titov's textures in his large-scale works suggest that these pieces were meant not to separate the choirs in alteration, but to unite them, so there is no direct connection to the antiphonal style of the Western Baroque.Dolskaya-Ackerly, 207‚Äì210. A characteristic feature is the so- called variantnost (–≤–∞—Ä–∏–∞–Ω—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å), the linking of melodic motifs by continuous subtle alterations which is also an important element in Russian chant and folk polyphonic traditions.Jensen, 981.Dolskaya-Ackerly, 208. The prayer Mnogaya leta (–ú–Ω–æ–≥–∞—è –ª–µ—Ç–∞), or Bol'shoe mnogoletie (–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–µ) proved to be the most enduring of Titov's compositions, possibly because its polyphony was more simple and therefore in line with the ideals of Classical music era. It was sung in Russian churches up to the October Revolution.Dolskaya-Ackerly, 220.

During a sign war, campaign workers, both staffers and volunteers, seek to have a greater sign presence than their opposition. Sign wars may consist of tens of thousands of signs in standard sizes ranging from placards to 4'x8's and may include a wide variety of signs that have been improvised by campaigns and their volunteers. Sign wars as a campaign tactic Journalists frequently report on sign wars during the campaign season. Particularly for campaigns that aren't large enough to have a regular stream of polling data for the local news media to report on, journalists will use other numbers based metrics such as the number of yard signs for each candidate in the district to help gauge support for individual candidates. Candidates and campaign staff often stoke the fires of election sign wars to claim that their candidate has popular support among the voters in the district. Notable sign wars A notable sign war occurs during the popular Shad Planking in Wakefield, Virginia. Every April, locals and politicians from all around the Commonwealth gather for some politicking, beer drinking, and fish eating. Nationally, in August 2007, Democrat presidential hopefuls John Edwards and Barack Obama each claimed victory for his side in the sign war that occurred at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Probably one of the most famous sign wars occurs every presidential election year at the Jefferson Jackson dinner in Des Moines Iowa.

The school was founded in 1983 at Woollahra. Emanuel School currently caters for approximately 800 students from Kindergarten to Year 12. The Principal has been Mr. Andrew Watt since 2018. The school is affiliated with the Jewish Communal Appeal, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), and the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA). The heritage-listed school site has previously served as a school, monastery, seminary and gentleman's private residence. The school is located at 18-20 Stanley Street, Randwick in the City of Randwick local government area. The site was designed by Edmund Blacket (Aston Lodge and now Saunders Administration Building) and built from 1864 to 1936. It is also known as Aston Lodge; Loreto Sisters' School; Mount St. Joseph; Little Sisters of the Poor Novitiate; International Grammar School. The site was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. School history In 1982, under the leadership of Rabbi Brian Fox and with the support of many other members of Temple Emanuel Woollahra (now known as Emanuel Synagogue) and the wider Jewish community of Sydney, the idea of Emanuel School was born. On 2 February 1983 the first 53 students from Kindergarten to Year 6 were enrolled in rooms at Temple Emanuel. Later in 1983, Years 3 to 7 moved to an unused school in Watsons Bay, in the grounds of Our Lady Star of the Sea. In 1984, with significant financial assistance and personal support from Mr Aron Kleinlehrer, together with communal generosity, Emanuel School purchased their present site in Randwick. The School opened its doors in 1985 with 230 students from Years K-8. The Prime Minister at the time, The Honourable R. J. Hawke officially opened the school in 1986. In 2001 the Emanuel School Board took on a new management plan, which included the appointment of a new school Principal ‚Äì Dr Bruce Carter It's an honour entry - Bruce Northleigh CARTER, Member of the Order of Australia - 10 June 2002 . \\"For service to education as a principal, administrator and educator, particularly through Cranbrook School and professional educational bodies and forums.\\" In 2005, under the auspices of the NSW Jewish Communal Appeal, the Emanuel School ran a successful Capital Appeal which primarily aids in debt reduction and some property development. At the end of 2017, Anne Hasting retired from her position as principal of The Emanuel School; as of 2018, Andrew Watt is the principal. Site history =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities - rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1,500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841 as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sand hills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stable hands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Aston Lodge estate= Gentleman's Estate (1862-1901) The area of land which subsequently was developed into the Aston Lodge Estate was offered for sale by the NSW Government in August 1862. The Crown land, released for sale under the recently enacted Crown Lands Alienation Act, 1861, offered a total of 18 lots. The public auction was undertaken by Messrs W. Dean and Co. of Pitt and O'Connell Streets. Lots 1, 2, 11, part 3 and part 10 of Section 8 (being a total of 11 acres which formed the Aston Estate) was purchased by John Watkins. Watkins also purchased another 12 acres of land to the east in the block bounded by present-day Carrington Road, Hooper Street, Bella Lane and Darley Road, it adjoins Queens Park. The Torrens Title land title deed for the 11 acres was registered by the Registrar General and issued to John Watkins in August 1864. The Crown grant included a Building Covenant to the effect that \\"only one residence with the necessary out-buildings shall be erected on the said land..\\" This Restriction was rescinded in May 1899. Watkins is known to have engaged the architect Edmund Thomas Blacket to design the extant double storey, sandstone built, suburban villa known as Aston Lodge. A tender for a dwelling house in Randwick was placed by Edmund Blacket in The Sydney Morning Herald on 20 May 1863 which may relate to Watkins house. Blacket was born in England in 1817. Blacket's professional training included a period as railway surveyor. He had a considerable interest in English medieval architecture, which later provided Blacket with the intellectual background for his work in Australia in the Gothic Revival style. Blacket arrived in Sydney in November, 1842. For the first seven years in the colony he was largely preoccupied with church and school commissions. In December 1849 he succeeded Mortimer Lewis as the Colonial Architect of New South Wales (which at that time was also responsible for what is now Queensland). He resigned from this position in September, 1854. During this period Blacket was responsible for a number of varied, but small scale projects. Back in private practice he produced a variety of residential, ecclesiastical and commercial works. He died in 1883. The first entry for Watkins residency at Aston Lodge is 1865.5 John Watkins was born in Monmouth, Wales on 22 May 1811. It is believed Watkins came to Australia in 1843 and initially resided in Tasmania. He married Ann Frazier in 1844, and the couple had at least two children - John Leo (1849) and Aston James (1852), but there may have been others as the published genealogies of this family are often contradictory in their detail giving different places of marriage, birth, etc. He was a Catholic. The Watkins family came to Sydney in 1853. By the time of residency at Randwick he was in partnership with James M. Leigh trading as Watkins and Leigh, importing merchants with premises in George Street, and a bonded store in Phillip Street. Watkins residency of Aston Lodge was for the years 1865-1867, 1871-1875 (the house appears to have been left vacant through all or part 1876), and from 1877 until his death in 1884 (on 21 April at the age of 74 years). Mrs John Watkins continued to reside in the house until 1887. During his life Watkins served as an alderman of Randwick Council for the years 1874- 1880 (being the alderman for West Ward (which included Aston Lodge) for 1875-1880) and as mayor for the terms 1870-1872, and 1884. He was also a Board Member of the Society for Relief of Destitute Children. For the interims of Watkins non-residency the house was tenanted as follows:- 1868 to c.1871 by, Walter Bradley (1836-1893). Bradley's tenure is believed to have occurred due to the building of his own residence at this time, Sunnyside, also situated in Randwick. For the latter half of this period (1870-1871) he served as mayor of Randwick Council. Bradley arrived in Sydney in the mid-1850s, and established a large auctioneering house which later traded as Bradley Newton Lamb. Apart from his commercial interests (which included the noted coaching company Cobb and Co.), Bradley was instrumental in establishing a number of ornithological societies and the Sydney Zoological Gardens. As mentioned, Bradley was mayor of Randwick for the terms of 1870, 1871, 1872 and 1884. He was also the M.L.A. for East Sydney for a time. In 1873 the house was tenanted by William Colbum Mayne. In 1886 this being Henry Grimslow, and in 1889 Henry G. Lomax (squatter), and then from 1890 to 1892 by the Hales family. In January 1894 John Watkins's first born son, John Leo, was registered as the owner of the Aston Lodge Estate. John Leo after education at Sydney Grammar School and Christ's College, Cambridge was called to the London Bar in 1872. Having returned to Sydney in 1873, in 1874 he was admitted to the N.S.W Bar. He married Agnes Jane Makinson daughter of Thomas Cooper Makinson of the legal firm ? in 1879, and subsequently resided at Llanthony, Hunters Hill in 1885. After at period at the Bar, John Leo was appointed to the position of N.S.W. Parliamentary Draftsman in 1892 and retained this position until 1918. As such he was involved in the drafting of many pieces of legislature during this period, and, with Edmund Barton and others, the draft constitutions for the Commonwealth of Australia. =Private then religious schools (1891-1901)= In 1891 the first of two schools which operated in Aston Lodge in the closing years of the nineteenth century was established by Misses Anne A. Hales (Hales father? George, a tea merchant, was also resident at this time). Hales' residence and presumably school continued until May 1892.14 This school was one of about seven such private schools operating in the Randwick area at the time. In July 1892 the Loreto Sisters of Ballarat, Victoria opened their first school (with convent) in New South Wales at Aston Lodge. The Loreto Sisters had arrived in Sydney in mid-January 1892 initially staying at Avonmore Terraces, The Avenue, Randwick. After a brief lease of a property known as Selbourne on Alison Road between late January and April 1892 (which was considered too far from Randwick village and tram route) a lease of Aston Lodge (with 11 acres) was negotiated with John Leo Watkins at an annual rental of ¬£300. The Loreto Sisters' school was advertised as a Boarding and Day School run by the sisters under the charge of M.M. Dorothea Frizell for a \\"limited number of Young Lady Boarders\\". The use of the site by the Loreto Sisters included the residence as a convent, school, chapel and boarders' dormitories. Within a short period of time a double storey timber dormitory was also constructed, the architect for which was Richard Dennehy. (This building is reported to have been later removed to the Loreto's Normanhurst campus). The Sisters of Loreto Order was established in Germany in the early seventh century by a number of expatriate English Catholics. The work of this Order was first extended to Australia in 1875 from the Irish Mother House with the establishment of Mary's Mount Ballarat, Victoria. The Order expanded into New South Wales at the beginning of 1892 with four nuns under the charge of Mother Mary Dorothea Frizelle. The Loreto school proved very successful within its first years of opening providing courses in instruction at moderate cost for both boarders and day girls who whom were prepared for the Senior, Junior and Matriculation Public examinations. The goal of the Sisters was to train the girls in \\"character, and to educate them without cramming. In point of fact, to bring them up naturally, moulding their lives into those of women of genuine piety and nobility of nature, developing their intellects.\\" The Sisters adopted the \\"kindergarten system\\" for instruction of younger children. In June 1894 'after lobbying by the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney Cardinal Moran, the Sisters assumed responsibility for religious education of primary school girls in the Randwick Parish. Histories of the Loreto Sisters mention that a wooden school building was erected in the grounds of Aston Lodge for this purpose, which was blessed and opened by the Cardinal, and that his building was later removed to the Loreto's Normanhurst campus, but it not entirely clear if this a mistaken reference to the boarder's dormitory previously mentioned. In October 1897 the boarders and four nuns moved to the new purpose built school and convent established in the upper North Shore suburb of Normanhurst. The day girls continued to be educated at Randwick until the school at Kirribilli was opened in 1901 (occupying their present premises in 1907)20. The last move was reported to have been due to Kirribilli being more convenient for the school's pupils in terms of contiguity to the tram, ferry and rail services. =Aged care and novitiate/Mount St. Joseph (1901-1984)= Commencing in early 1901, the Aston Lodge Estate site was subdivided by John Leo Watkins. The present-day curtilage of the site 3 acres 2 roods 20 114 perches (being Lots 1, 2 and 11 of this subdivision) bounded by present-day Avoca Street, Stephen Street, Stanley Street and Chepstow Street) was acquired by the Little Sisters of the Poor in July 1901. The Little Sisters gave the Loreto Sisters one month's notice to leave the premises. The Little Sisters of the Poor Order was established in France by Jeanne Jugan in 1839 with the role of caring for the elderly poor in the community. By their own fundamental rule, the Order could not accept any funds or any permanent endowment, with their help extended to the poor coming from providential dispensation of daily charity. The members of the order practice four vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and hospitality. By the turn of this century the Order comprised approximately 5,000 sisters around the world. The mother house (La Tour St. Joseph) is at St. Pern, France. The first congregation of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Australia was founded in Melbourne in November 1884. The second foundation in Australia followed two years later in Sydney with seven nuns arriving in November 1886. The invitation to undertake charitable work in Sydney came from the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Moran, with the provision of financial help came from prominent Catholics of the day such as John Hughes, M.L.C. and member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and a Miss Sharkey and her Ladies' Association of Charity. The Little Sisters of the Poor were one of about seven comparable Catholic religious caring orders established in New South Wales in the late nineteenth century. The other orders were: - Aston Lodge was converted to a novitiate for the Order with its first 7 postulants starting in 1901. A wooden chapel was built soon after, replaced by the present chapel in 1921. Its interior was intended to recall the chapel at the Order's Mother House in St.Pern, France. Further additions comprised a laundry and old men's quarters built in 1929 to the design of Scott, Green and Scott, who also designed a gate house built in 1932-3. In the 1930s with increasing numbers of young women wishing to enter the order, an extensive new Novitiate building was built in 1936-7 designed by Scott, Green & Scott. A building known as Marian House on the Chepstow Street side was built for extra accommodation. By the 1970s, the number of young women wishing to enter the Order had declined dramatically. In 1982 the Little Sisters of the Poor proposed selling Aston Lodge to developer Beinda P/L for $3.1m to raise funds to rebuild and upgrade their aged care facilities nearby at Mount St. Joseph's. To facilitate the sale the Order sought a rezoning of the site from church use to 2 (C2) to allow high rise development. The original scheme had a number of 3 and 8 storey flat buildings and 20 town houses and necessitated demolishing the 1921 chapel and 1936 novitiate and converting Aston Lodge to flats. It met widespread opposition from the community and interest groups. The Heritage Council of NSW placed a section 130 order on Aston Lodge (stopping demolition) on 15 May 1983. The Heritage Council refused the development application in 1983. The Novitiate subsequently relocated to its Hastings, New Zealand establishment and the Aston Lodge novitiate site was sold in 1984. Randwick City Council approved the Mount St. Joseph's development in April 1984 and the old buildings there were demolished and the site redeveloped. =Emanuel School (1984-present)= Emanuel School, pictured in 2015. In February 1984 the Little Sisters of the Poor conveyed part of the Aston Lodge site under lease-purchase agreement to the International Grammar School, a non-denominational independent school. Under the arrangement the IGS acquired an interest in the use of the novitiate, Aston Lodge and chapel for school purposes. Simultaneously the Emanuel School expressed an interest in purchasing the site and entered negotiations with the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Order decided in favour of The Emanuel School in July 1984, who in turn offered to accommodate the IGS for two years to allow them to find a new site. IGS leased the site through 1984 and relocated to Surry Hills in 1985. In February 1985 title of a substantial area of the property was registered to The Emanuel School. The remainder of the present site, at the corner of Chepstow and Stanley Streets, was bought in 1986. This allowed The Emanuel School to consolidate their schools for infants, primary and secondary pupils on a single site. In February 1986 Government approval was granted to use the property as an infants and secondary school. It was officially opened by Prime Minister Bob Hawke on 17 August 1986. A range of works converted Aston Lodge to offices (now called the Saunders Administration Building), deconsecration of the chapel to convert it to classrooms and library, conversion of laundry into Art Block, novitiate into classrooms (Brender Moss Building), assembly hall and synagogue, converting Marian House to use as the Adler School, building a new entrance off Stanley Street and two demountable classroom blocks. Since 1986 the School embarked on a major capital works program, with a new hall, kindergarten, various blocks, new perimeter walls etc. A conservation management study was prepared for the property by Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners in 1999 and updated in 2002 with more of a focus on the landscape components of the school grounds.NBRS & Partners, 2015, 10-12 =Laundry Block (Art Building) history= The Lynette Sandra Phillips Art Building was built in brick with terracotta tile roof as a laundry and adjacent drying yard in 1929, designed by Scott, Green & Scott.NBRS & P, 2015, 13-14 It sits on a sandstone retaining wall which may date to the second half of the 20th century.NBRS & P, 2015, 16 Perhaps during the 1940s dormer windows were modified and verandahs on north and south sides enclosed.NBRS & P, 2015, 15-16 Facilities and curriculum The School has a compulsory Instrumental Programme for students from Year 3 to 6 and students are encouraged to continue this until year 12. This ensures that music is one of Emanuel's focal points. Sport is another focal point of Emanuel's students. The Emanuel School Learning Centre has specialised educators who support classroom learning across the entire school. Experienced and specially trained practitioners lead the \\"Gifted and Talented Programme\\" and \\"Opportunity Classes\\". Students benefit from the Laptop Programme which requires laptops for all primary Opportunity Classes and all High School students. The Kornmehl Centre Emanuel Pre-school is situated on the same campus as the K-12 school and caters for 60 children from 3 to 5 years of age. = Condition = While outside the scope of this report (see section 1.5), the place may be of Aboriginal archaeological potential in that it is probably sited on the same massive dune system as the Prince of Wales Hospital site where in recent years shell middens have been unearthed through controlled archaeological investigation. The site has a documented European occupation back to the mid-19th century. It is the location of one of a comparatively small number of large domestic residences built in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. A succession of surveys dating from -1930s and photographs from s-s describe the physical evolution of the site to indicate that the first permanent capital improvement was made for a stone residence and stables for the Watkins family which has been altered, adapted and extended with addition of new buildings over time to the present. Within this known occupational history, the earlier c.1864-1901 phase in view of the generally domestic nature of land uses and improvement may be of archaeological potential in that: * the physical survey indicates that there have been few major internal alterations to Aston Lodge. Controlled intervention may therefore reveal details of original/early space finishes and fittings and potential deposits within concealed sub-floor spaces; * while the site has potentially been disturbed by building works undertaken from c.1920 there are areas in the vicinity of Aston Lodge, in particular within the enclosed kitchen/work yard which may not have been disturbed and may therefore be of archaeological potential for features such as latrines and wells, food dumps, sewerage and drainage works, etc.; * landscaping works in the form of paths, drives, etc. laid out during this period may be extant under the existing reinforced concrete system. Of the next phase, c.1901- say c.1940, that being the construction and operation of the former Novitiate, the site may be of archaeological potential in that: *archaeological investigation may therefore reveal new information about the configuration and uses of a number of now demolished buildings shown on a c.1930s survey (figure A4.9); *archaeological investigation may reveal new information about the configuration of some of the extant buildings located near the entrance drive and their potential date of construction.CMP, 1999, 42-3 = Modifications and dates = *1860s+: 11 acre estate - Aston Lodge (Watkins, who also purchased another 12 acres of land to the east) *1891: run as a boarding school privately. *1892: Loreto Sisters opened their first school in NSW on this site. *1901: subdivision down to c3ha site; sale to Little Sisters of the Poor for a home for the aged poor, and novitiate *1983 - part of site leased to International Grammar School *1984 - site sold to the Emanuel School.

Blacket which is of exceptionally high integrity, with remnant garden planting, and a fine and simple chapel (1921) and novitiate (1936) buildings constructed for the mendicant Roman Catholic order of the Little Sisters of the Poor who owned the site between 1901 and 1985. Set on one of the highest points of the North Randwick ridge, within expansive grounds, parts of the site, in particular the novitiate building of 1936, are highly visible from areas in Queens Park, Centennial Park, Woollahra and Bondi Junction and as such it is one of the most prominent landmarks in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. The site has important social and historical associations with the development of the Randwick area through the occupation of James Watkins, merchant and alderman of Randwick Council, and his large villa estate, the development of late 19th century private education in the eastern suburbs of Sydney with the Loreto Sisters' school, and the development of social welfare in NSW with the use of the site as the novitiate for the Little Sisters of the Poor who ran the adjoining Mount St. Joseph home for the aged which was one of about three non-government aged homes operating in New South Wales in the late 19th century. The site also contains a number of features which are historically associated with the use of the site by the Little Sisters of the Poor which are notable aesthetically within the Randwick area. These include the high enclosing walls (late 1920s & 1930s), the gate lodge (1932), the laundry (1929), and paths, drives and early plantings (s) by Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1999:46; modified slightly by Mayne-Wilson & Associates, 2002, 55). Emanuel School was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Place served as the novitiate for the Little Sisters of the Poor since purchase of the site in 1901 up to closure in the 1980s. The novitiate was the first and only such establishment founded by the Little Sisters of the Poor in this country. The novitiate was for the whole of the Little Sisters of the Poor's sphere of operation in Oceania which included homes in Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. In Auckland and Dunedin, New Zealand, and Noum√©a and New Caledonia. The use of the place as the novitiate for the Little Sisters of the Poor in Oceania is rare in the context of the worldwide history of this Order's operation.Clive Lucas Stapleton & Partners, 1999 See also * List of non-government schools in New South Wales * Judaism in Australia References = Bibliography =   = Attribution = External links *A more detailed history of the school.

Its status in the IUCN Red List is critically endangered, with an estimated wild population of 482-632 animals. Taxonomy Cyclura cychlura inornata is one of three subspecies of the Northern Bahamian rock iguana, the others being the Andros Island iguana (C. c. cychlura) and the Exuma Island iguana (C. c. figginsi). It was found to be genetically indistinct from C. c. figginsi further south down the chain of the Exuma Islands. The different populations were likely one unbroken one 18,000 years ago during the last ice age, when the islands of the chain were likely all joined together in one large island. Description The Allen Cays rock iguana is a large rock iguana of which the localised population on Allen's Cay attains a total length of close to . The iguana is normally half the size and a sixth the weight of those on Allen's Cay. Its coloration is dark-gray to black, with yellowish green or orange tinged scales on the legs, dorsal crest, and the head. When the animal matures, the yellow coloration changes to a bright reddish orange color in contrast to the animals darker striped body and black feet. This species, like other species of Cyclura, is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. Distribution This rock iguana subspecies is endemic to the northern Exuma Island chain in the Bahamas. Before the 1990s, it was restricted to only the uninhabited Leaf Cay and U Cay, but it then began to colonise neighbouring Allen's Cay and other nearby islands such as Flat Rock Reef Cay. It arrived on these islands perhaps swimming or floating the distance in some cases, or perhaps helped by humans. Small numbers of up to five animals are sometimes found on the tiny surrounding islets. It was purposely spread to Alligator Cay thirty kilometres to the south, and from there appears to have spread to Narrow Water Cay and Warderick Wells Cay. The IUCN red list assessment of 2018 states most of the introductions to other islands are human assisted. Research at genetic divergence in the different populations found some discernible genetic difference between the U and Leaf Cay populations, but also evidence of recent admixture blamed on unauthorised human introductions between islands. Leaf Cay appears the source for all the introductions to other islands. Ecology It is found in low, open forest, coastal shrubland and along beaches in elevations from sea level to 10m. The forests here can reach to seven metres high. From December through April there is a cooler dry season. Among the restricted amount of plant species found growing on its islands are Borrichia arborescens, Bumelia americana, Casasia clusiifolia, Conocarpus erectus, Coccoloba uvifera, Drypetes diversifolia, Eugenia foetida, Guaiacum sanctum, Ipomoea indica, Jacquinia keyensis, Leucothrinax morrisii, Manilkara bahamensis, Pithecellobium keyense, Rhachicallis americana, Solanum bahamense, Suriana maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Sophora tomentosa, Thalassia testudinum and Uniola paniculata. 48 species of plant are said to grow on Leaf Cay. On Alligator Cay there are 24 species of plant of which the most abundant are Borrichia arborescens, Cyperus sp., Guapira discolor, Pseudophoenix sargentii and Rhachicallis americana. Others are similar to the other Cays, but there is more mangrove here, as well as an Opuntia sp. and Erithalis fruticosa. There are only a few introduced species of plants, but there are some ornamentals such as palms. It requires areas for nesting with a layer of sand of at least half a metre deep. The cays where it lives have a type of native night heron that will occasionally snack on a baby iguana. It is diurnal, spending nights in 'retreats' under the leaves of thatch palms, in tunnels they sometimes dig and sometimes in the open. It also uses crevices and holes in limestone rocks as retreats and will congregate in areas rich in these. Outside of the mating season, male rock iguanas have dominance hierarchies rather than strictly defended territories like cyclura from other islands. This has been attributed to the regular food supply from tourists feeding the lizards on the beach causing a disruption in their social structure. However, a 2000 report demonstrated this theory tested on Alligator Cay, which is free from tourists, and also found a low amount of male-to-male aggression in this species. The author of that study pointed to the small nature of the inhabited islands as a reason for reduced aggression. =Diet= All iguanas except the largest adults climb into the vegetation to feed, including up the smooth boles of thatch palms. Even adults have been found up in a Pseudophoenix palm to eat the flower buds. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on fruits, leaves, and flowers of most available plants. Individuals can survive on very tiny islands from the available plants. On Alligator Cay the population eats mostly Rhachicallis americana and Suriana maritima, the former is more common and is eaten more, but the lizards show a preference for the latter, which is relatively much more uncommon on the island. Two studies in the remains of their faeces found occasional crab claws, insects, molluscs and fledgling birds, and they have been observed to be occasionally carnivorous. They also have been found to eat their shed skin. On Alligator Cay three plants were not observed to be eaten: Hymenocallis arenicola and Strumpfia maritima, and the mangrove Rhizophora mangle. More than a quarter of the faeces were made up of fruit. The iguana ate the large fruit of Casasia clusiifolia and Manilkara bahamensis, as well as the small fruit of the sea grape Coccoloba uvifera, and the palms Coccotrinax argentata and Pseudophoenix sargentii. Casasia fruit are produced throughout the year and represented 9.6% of the total faecal matter, the second most prevalent item. The iguanas feed on more leaves when they are forced to during the cool and dry season. Biologists Kristen Richardson, John Iverson and Carolyn Kurle investigated the diets of the Allen Cays Rock Iguanas on islands in the Bahamas. Their 2019 study made use of carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to estimate iguana diets in order to explain why iguanas on Allen's Cay were ~2 times longer and ~6 times heavier than the same subspecies on nearby Leaf Cay and U Cay, the populations being only a generation removed and separated by a channel. They had hypothesized that the gigantic iguanas were eating shearwater carcasses killed by mice and barn owls, but they found no evidence for that hypothesis. Instead they determined that their gigantism was due to their consumption of plant material containing more nutrients than the plants on the other cays. The added nutrients came from the ocean in the form of seabird guano; the largest colony of Audubon's shearwaters (Puffinis iherminieri) are located on Allen's Cay. None of the other cays have large populations of seabirds and so are missing the extra amounts of nutrients that arrive in the form of guano on Allen's Cay. Their evidence strongly supports that these iguanas are herbivores and the giants on Allen Cay are so large because their plants contain higher levels of nutrients from seabird guano. Tourists often feed the iguanas human food items on Leaf Cay and sometimes U Cay. The iguanas have come to expect to be fed and may congregate in large numbers awaiting the tourists. =Mating= Mating occurs in May, and eggs are usually laid in mid-June to mid-July, in nests excavated in sand. The females migrate to suitable areas to nest. On the newly colonised Allen's Cay there is no sand on the jagged honeycomb limestone beaches, and the iguanas have never bred there. The subspecies previously bred on only the two original islands U and Leaf Cay, but on the islands of Alligator Cay and Flat Rock Reef Cay there are suitable breeding sites. Only one in three females nests in a given year, although the largest females nest annually. One to ten eggs are laid; larger females lay more eggs than do smaller females. Hatching occurs with a success rate of 79% in late September and early October after an incubation 80-85 days at nest temperatures of . Conservation =Status= The IUCN assessed the population to be endangered in 1996 and 2000, but in 2018 it assessed that the populations had become critically endangered. In the early 1900s the population was almost wiped out, but had increased to some 150 iguanas by 1970 on the only two islands were it bred. In 1982, this had increased to a bit over 200 animals. In the early 1980s the population was growing at some 20% annually, and it had recovered by the end of the century to the limit of the carrying capacity of its original islands. In 2000, it was estimated that the current global population was less than 1,000 and it was said to be declining, although it was actually increasing. In 2018 the population was assessed to be 482-632 (mature adult) individuals, with 482 being the amount of mature adult iguanas on U and Leaf Cay in 2016 based on recapture counts. This number does not include over 150 adult iguanas found on islands where it believed they cannot breed. The population on Allen's Cay was at 20-25 for a number of decades according to Iverson, but it was reduced to ten individuals in 2013 indirectly due to bird conservation activities. In the 1990s, a number of iguanas were moved to nearby islands. Iverson and P. Hall, a warden of Exumas Cays Land and Sea Park moved only eight sub-adults to Alligator Cay between 1988 and 1990, of which at least seven had survived ten years later, and these had increased to between 75 and 90 individuals in 1999 based on recapture analysis of 28 caught and tagged iguanas during four visits. Mostly larger lizards were caught and it was expected there were many more juveniles, and the island had not reached carrying capacity. According to the IUCN the population declined over the next decade due to hurricane damage of the vegetation and emigration to the nearby island of Narrow Water Cay. Hines reported seeing 28 iguanas on Alligator Cay and an estimated 38 iguanas on Narrow Water Cay in 2013, and found that apparently some iguanas had successfully emigrated to nearby Warderick Wells Cay. The Flat Rock Reef Cay population was introduced in the mid-1990s, apparently without authorisation. It rapidly increased to around 200 individuals by 2012, although the IUCN claimed in 2018 that the island would not sustain this population due to its low carrying capacity. =Threats= The primary threat to this species according to IUCN in 2018 is ecotourism and the feeding of the lizards by tourists. A number of tour operators and sometimes private yachts moor at either of the islands, bringing a few hundred tourists a day to see the lizards on both Leaf and U Cay. Tourists may transmit diseases and parasites and sometimes feed the iguanas unnatural food such as foreign fruit, bread, brownies or meat which is believed to contribute to health problems for the lizards such as faecal impaction and high levels of cholesterol. Despite dogs and cats being banned, tourists continue to bring their pets and a single loose dog could eliminate a population. Furthermore the IUCN alleges that tour operators may have moved some of the largest lizards off to other islands where they cannot scare the tourists, because they found a tagged individual on and islet eight kilometres away from where he was tagged, and they state large iguanas appear to be becoming rarer in the population. The iguanas are the primary tourist attraction to this area of the Bahamas. A century ago, in the early 1900s, the Allen Cays rock iguana was almost wiped out due to being hunted for food by locals. As of 2003 the animals were still said to be hunted for food and captured for sale in the pet trade. In 2018 this was repeated by the IUCN, although there is no documentation that this has occurred. =Recovery efforts= Like all Bahamian rock iguanas, this species is protected in the Bahamas under the Wild Animals Protection Act of 1968. It is listed in Appendix I of the CITES convention. Allen's Cay was formerly over- run by the common house mouse (Mus musculus), an invasive species, and these were in their turn attracting barn owls (Tyto alba) from neighbouring islands. In May 2012, Island Conservation and the Bahamas National Trust worked together to remove invasive house mice from Allen's Cay to protect the Audubon's shearwater and hopefully also native species such as the Allen Cay rock iguana and the Bahama yellowthroat. As it was feared the Allen Cay rock iguana might eat the rodenticide used to rid the island of the mice, eighteen were transplanted to nearby Flat Rock Reef Cay, where another small population already existed. Sixteen of these had starved to death by 2013. It is now thought this was because the plants on Flat Rock Reef Cay lacked the extra nutrients found on Allen's Cay. After this eight iguanas survived on Allen's Cay, and including the two from Flat Rock Reef Cay there are now ten iguanas thought to be left on the island. In 2012, Iverson had begun a project to fill a small sinkholes on the island with sand to create suitable breeding ground. The population on Alligator Cay was released there as part of a conservation translocation program. It was seen as quite successful in 2001. Alligator Cay and surrounding islands are part of the national Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park. There are no captive breeding programmes which have been undertaken in this subspecies.

Its ancient name was Senusret Petei Tawi (Senusret beholds the two lands).Lehner, M. (1997). The Complete Pyramids. London:Thames and Hudson Ltd. The pyramid was 105 meters on each side with a height of 61.25 meters; the slope of the four faces was 49¬∞ 24'. The pyramid used a method of construction never before seen in an Egyptian pyramid; four stone walls radiated from the center built of rough-hewn blocks that decreased in size the higher their placement. The eight sections formed by these walls were then subdivided by three more walls, splitting the pyramid into 32 different units which were then filled with slabs of stone as well as debris. An exoskeleton of fine limestone then covered the structure. This new method of construction was not particularly efficient, however, and the completed pyramid suffered from stability problems. Unusually, clear evidence for the ramps used to construct the pyramid also remain.  Complex  Surrounding the actual structure was a comparatively large complex, which consisted of a mortuary temple, a rectangular structure with a courtyard in the center, and nine smaller pyramids for Senusret's queens. From the mortuary, a limestone causeway with carved statues set every 10 cubits ran to a public temple outside the perimeter wall of the compound. Little of this is visible today, however, because later Roman buildings were built over the complex.  Excavations  The pyramid has been severely damaged over time, and little of its limestone cladding remains. It now appears as little more than a hillock of stone. None of the excavations penetrated to the burial chamber due to high water levels, but much was learned about pyramid construction from the surrounding quarries, which contained one of the highest concentrations of ancient debris of any Egyptian archaeological site. =Gautier and Jequier= The pyramid was first explored by archaeologists Gautier and Jequier between 1894 and 1895. = Metropolitan Museum of Art = From 1906 to 1943, the pyramid was excavated by a team from the Metropolitan Museum of Art headed by Lythgoe, Mace and Ambrose Lansing. = Dieter Arnold = From 1984 to 1987, further excavation was carried out by Dieter Arnold.

Two skin heads are attached to a single hollow, often intricately carved wooden shell. The preferred wood is jackwood, although other woods like rosewood may be used. Both left and right heads are usually made from cow hide that is stretched around a thin metal ring (sometimes lizard skin is used for the right head). The outer circumference of each head is perforated with approximately seven to eight holes. The two heads are held in tension by a continuous rope that is woven around the drum in a V-shape pattern. Additional small coils of string or metal are tied around each pair of ropes near the left head. These coils can be slide horizontally along the length of the drum, increasing or decreasing the tension between the heads as necessary. For example, during the monsoon season the drum heads will slacken so much that the instrument becomes unplayable. Using these coils drummers can easily rectify such problems. Technique The urumi is slung with a cloth strap across the shoulder and played by the drummer horizontally. This simple harness allows the drummer to play standing or walking. The urumi is played entirely with sticks. There are five basic sounds that can be played on the drum: an \\"open sound\\" produced by striking the right head, a deep resonant \\"moaning\\" sound produced by striking the right head while simultaneously rubbing the left head with the edge of a long curved stick, a bent \\"talking drum-like\\" tone in which the right head is stuck while the left hand squeezes and releases the rope holding the heads together, and two closed (non-pitched) sounds produced by striking and pressing/muting with the left and right stick respectively. Castor oil is often applied to the left head in order to facilitate the drummer's ability to produce the \\"moaning sound\\" described above. Notation As an oral tradition, Tamil folk music does not have a codified system of written notation. Musicians learn through years of unconscious absorption, conscious listening, imitation, and practice. History and performance context This drum is widely believed to possess supernatural and sacred powers. When played in religious ceremonies and processions, the performance of specific beats on the urumi may induce spirit possessions or Trance. The urumi is also played in the South Indian state of Kerala, which borders Tamil Nadu. The urumi is most often performed in two types of ensembles: *Urumi Melam *Naiyandi Melam Urumi melam ensembles usually consists of double-reed instruments Nadaswaram, a pair of double headed drums called pambai, and one to three urumi drums; this particular ensemble is associated exclusively with funerals and other inauspicious occasions. The naiyandi melam is the most common type of folk ensemble associated with ritual and dance. A typical naiyandi melam is composed of two double-reed nadaswaram, one or two thavil (barrel drums), a thamukku (kettle drum played with leather straps), a pambai, and an urumi. In the popular dance known as Devarattam (dance), usually 2 to 3 urumis will be played with specific beats; sometimes a thappu (parai) is played in the background to keep a tempo. It performs for a number of festive occasions including dance-dramas, menstruation ceremonies, weddings, harvest festivals, and staged folk dances such as :- -Devarattam - Performed by the Rajakambalathu Nayakkar community \\\\- Poikkal Kudirai (dummy horse dance) \\\\- Mayil Attam (peacock dance) \\\\- Puli Attam (tiger dance) \\\\- Kavadi Attam (a devotional dance to Lord Murugan) and many others.

Biography Noyes was born in Norway, Maine, and was the son of Amos Oscar Noyes and Anna Chase Noyes. Since A. Oscar Noyes neglected the family as he was away much of the time attending to his business interests and civic commitments, George's mother Anna had the most influence on him. As a result, young George spent extended periods with his grandfather Chase in the western mountains of Maine where he came to embrace the solitude of the Maine wilderness, rejecting formal education and organized religion. He was known as the thoreauvian of Maine. In the summer of 1890, while in Fryeburg, Maine, George went to the nearby White Mountain artist colony in North Conway, New Hampshire to pursue his interest in art and talked with some of the many artists who came there every summer. It is not known how many artists he met, but it's on record that George spent the day and night at the home of Benjamin Champney, the famous landscape artist. Noyes kept an undated journal in which he wrote his thoughts on life, God, religion, children, war, pitfalls of modern life and the spiritual beauty of nature. The writing style addressed the presence of a future reader and makes frequent use of colloquial spellings to make points. Much of his writing takes the form of allegories in which he comments on the absurdity of social norms and human folly. The 1,500-page journal was profusely illustrated with some 300 monochrome ink wash landscapes and pencil sketches, many in a chiaroscuro style, capturing atmospheric lighting conditions. These paintings, influenced by the White Mountain art style, were masterfully done with confident bold strokes and surprising textural details as captured only by someone who lived close to nature. His creative work expresses his lifelong optimism and belief that nature was the divine expression of God. In the 1920s the Erichman Print Gallery of New York city had an exhibition of a number of his paintings and sketches. Although a well-known artist, due to his particular solitary wilderness life, he never pursued art as a livelihood but as a private expression of his spiritual reverence for nature. During his life he worked as a mineral collector and operated the Noyes Mountain Quarry in Greenwood, Maine, known today as the Harvard Quarry. Many of the finds made there are in museums, including the Field Museum of Natural History Chicago. Noyes counted among his friends and associates George R. and Freeland Howe, Robert Bickford, Vivian Akers, Tim Heath, George Frederick Kunz, and others. In 1884 George married Belle H. Smith, they suffered the death of an infant son and had one surviving child Max. It appears that before or about 1905 George and Belle were separated. With their only child, Max serving in World War I, George by his own admission writes he is again alone and \\"orphaned\\" to the world. After his death in 1945, his journal and paintings were discovered and remained in a private family collection until 2007 when nearly all of the paintings and much of the manuscript was auctioned off to collectors.

Formerly known as Swan & Maclaren and Swan & Lermit, it was the most prominent architectural firm in Singapore when Singapore was a British colony in the early 20th century. History =Early history= The company began in Singapore, Straits Settlements as Swan & Lermit in 1887, a civil engineering firm formed by two surveyor engineers, Archibald Swan and Alfred Lermit. Lermit later withdrew from partnership in 1890, and later in 1892, it became Swan & Maclaren after another surveyor engineer, James Waddell Boyd Maclaren, joined as partner. =Rise to prominence= The Victoria Memorial Hall (right) was designed by RAJ Bidwell of Swan and Maclaren, who duplicated the adjacent original Town Hall that subsequently became the Victoria Theatre (left). Bidwell also designed the clock tower joining the two buildings. In 1897, Regent Alfred John Bidwell joined the firm, arriving in Singapore from England after a short working stint at the Public Works Department in Kuala Lumpur of the Federated Malay States. He was the first professionally trained architect in Singapore since George Drumgoole Coleman had practised in the town in the 1820s and 1830s. Bidwell found an opportunity in Singapore to exercise his knowledge of the full range and variety of Western architectural vocabulary. Because of Bidwell's talent and reputation for designing handsome government buildings, Swan and Maclaren became the dominant architectural firm in colonial Singapore. Bidwell dominated its work between 1897 and 1911. The firm proceeded to win the most prestigious commissions in Singapore, and many of its early buildings are still extant today. Some of these buildings have been gazetted as national monuments, and these include Raffles Hotel (1899), Teutonia Club (1900, now Goodwood Park Hotel) and Victoria Memorial Hall (1905, now Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall). One of Swan and Maclaren's most prominent projects was the Raffles Hotel, now a national monument. The Raffles Hotel was one of the first of the numerous projects by Bidwell under Swan and Maclaren, which was to build a substantial number of buildings in a large variety of architectural styles. The firm was commissioned to rebuild the Teutonia Club in 1900 in its new location on Scotts Road, after it moved from its location near Raffles Hotel on North Bridge Road. Bidwell applied the south German architectural style in his design of the clubhouse. In Singapore's downtown area, Bidwell also designed the three-storey Stamford House (formerly known as the Oranje Building), completed in 1904. By 1904, Swan and Maclaren was the largest architectural firm in Singapore. In 1905, Swan and Maclaren worked on the extensions and rebuilding of the Victoria Memorial Hall. In the same year, the Chesed-El Synagogue on Oxley Rise was built. In 1907, the Singapore Cricket Club was extended and refurbished, and the 'Eastern Extension' (later 'Telegraph House', today Sofitel 'So Singapore) on 35 Robinson Road was constructed. In that year, the firm also designed and built one of the largest shops in early Singapore, the John Little department store in Raffles Place, located on the opposite side of the square from Robinson & Co. Between 1906 and 1912, Swan and Maclaren rebuilt the Saint Joseph's Church on Victoria Street, dedicated to the Lady of Fatimah, in the Gothic style. In 1911, Bidwell left Swan and Maclaren to establish his own practice. By then, he was the most important architect in Singapore. =After RAJ Bidwell= Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam In 1913, Swan and Maclaren built a large villa for the Chinese businessman Eu Tong Sen on Mount Sophia. The Eu Villa was built at a grand cost of $1 million. In the same year, the firm designed the Jinrikisha Station on Neil Road. In the years between World Wars I and II, the firm continued to lead the local market with projects such as the Sultan Mosque (1924‚Äì28), Ocean Building (1923), Bank Chambers (now HSBC Building) (1925), Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church (1930) and the Singapore Turf Club (1934). In 1927 they completed the construction of the ‚ÄòEastern Extension‚Äô at 35 Robinson Road (later to be known as Telegraph House), the intersection of the ten most important overseas telegraph cables. It is today the (Sofitel) So Singapore. Swan and Maclaren also designed the Cenotaph, a granite memorial at the Esplanade Park that commemorates the soldiers who died in World War I. Its reverse side was inscribed with the names of soldiers who died in World War II. After World War II, Swan and Maclaren remained important continuing with projects such as Singapore Polytechnic's original campus at Prince Edward Road. They did, however lose some of its dominance due to increased competition from both local and foreign companies. =Since 1999= In May 1999, Swan and Maclaren Architects was awarded the architectural tender for the new National Library building on Victoria Street to replace the main library on Stamford Road that was demolished. It was shortlisted out of five for the final selection in National Library Board's architectural design competition, from the 30 firms that made submissions. In September 2000, the firm's team leader, Malaysian architect Ken Yeang, ended his partnership with Swan and Maclaren Architects, which had originally been contracted to see the project through to completion. Subsequently, NLB released the firm from its contract, and called for new tenders for the construction of the new National Library building. The National Library building was eventually opened on 22 July 2005, after three years of construction.

United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court. which upheld congressional power to fetter judicial review and to delegate broad and flexible law-making power to an administrative agency in this constitutional challenge to the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. The wartime anti-inflation measure, intended to expedite price control enforcement, conferred on the federal district courts jurisdiction over violations of Office of Price Administration (OPA) regulations made under the act. But judicial power to consider the constitutionality of such regulations was excepted. Congress specified that challenges to their validity be initially reviewed under stringent time limitations by the OPA and on appeal exclusively by a special Article III tribunal in the District of Columbia--the Emergency Court of Appeals--and thereafter by the Supreme Court. Background Massachusetts meat dealer Albert Yakus, criminally prosecuted for violating the wholesale beef price ceiling, had failed to launch a procedurally difficult pre-enforcement attack on the OPA regulations constitutionality and was barred from collateral challenges during his trial. The Court affirmed his conviction, holding that ‚Äúso long as there is an opportunity ‚Ä¶ for judicial review which satisfies the demands of due process,‚Äù the bifurcated enforcement and constitutional proceedings were permissible (p. 444). In dissent, Wiley Rutledge, with Frank Murphy, asserted that once Congress conferred jurisdiction, it could not compel the district judges to ignore Marbury v. Madison or violate the Constitution by enforcing the criminal sanctions, a statute, and regulations devoid of due process. A Yakus‚Äêlike incontestability provision reached the Court in Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States (1978).. Statutory construction facilitated evasion of the constitutional issues, but Lewis Powell, concurring, questioned the validity of Yakus except as an exercise of war powers. Nevertheless, modern environmental legislation contains judicial review schemes similar to that upheld in Yakus. Justice Roberts, who also dissented, embraced the non-delegation doctrine argument and held that the OPA had exercised unconstitutionally delegated congressional powers. The New Deal Court majority reacted by stipulating that statutory standards need only be sufficiently defined to permit ascertainment of the administrative agency's obedience to the congressional will. Implications for Administrative Law The Supreme Court's decision of Yakus v. United States was a major decision in determining the development of American administrative law. in particular, Yakus addressed the misunderstood nondelegation doctrine. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice Stone argued that an administrative agency could correct a problem of delegation if it limited its own power: > The standards prescribed by the present Act, with the aid of the \\"statement > of the considerations\\" required to be made by the Administrator, are > sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts and the > public to ascertain whether the administrator, in fixing the designated > prices, has conformed to those standards . . . Hence we are unable to find > in them an unauthorized delegation of legislative power.Yakus, 321 U.S. at > 426. Thus, Yakus held that an administrative agency could \\"save\\" an otherwise unconstitutional delegation of power through a narrowing construction that constrains the agency's own discretion. This would become a key principle in American constitutional law and would be followed by lower courts in striking down challenges to laws based on the nondelegation doctrine for the next fifty years. This Yakus principle was logically flawed however: how could an administrative agency itself cure a problem of delegation? If the problem of delegation is one of excessive legislative power transferred to the executive branch, then the actual delegation problem happens at the time of the passage of the statute--the act of an executive agency limiting that power is too late and does not correct the problem (it really only limits the problem). As some say, allowing the agency to correct a delegation problem is liking locking the barn doors after all the horses have already escaped. The Supreme Court finally came to this conclusion in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc.. In so doing, Justice Scalia denied that the Supreme Court had ever adopted such a stance on constitutional law: \\"We have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute.\\" Thus, in striking down its previous jurisprudence, the Supreme Court seems to have forgotten about its holding in Yakus.

He is generally thought to have worked at the Papal court at Avignon in the 1370s as his ballade, Par les bons Gedeons, praises antipope Clement VII. However, it has been suggested that Philippus never left Italy, that he wrote the above ballade at Fondi near Caserta, where Clement was elected Pope, and that he worked at the francophile court of Gian Galeazzo Visconti.Reinhard Strohm, The Rise of European Music, 1380‚Äì1500\\", Cambridge University Press, 1993, , pp.59-74Yolanda Plumley and Iain Fenlon, Early Music History, vol. 18: Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Music, Cambridge University Press, 2001, , pp.334-346. Music Most of his surviving works are ballades, although a Credo was recently discovered, and a rondeau has been attributed to him. His ballade En attendant souffrir was written for Bernab√≤ Visconti, confirmed by the presence of Visconti's motto in the upper voice. Two of Caserta's pieces, En remirant and De ma dolour, use fragments of text from chansons by the most famous composer of the century, Guillaume de Machaut. Caserta's own repute was significant enough for Johannes Ciconia to borrow portions of Caserta's ballades for his own virelai, Sus une fontayne.

Like many other peasant party leaders in Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria in 1945‚Äì1947, Petkov was tried and executed soon after postwar Soviet control was established in his country.Judt, Tony Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, p. 175. Penguin Press (2005), He was a son of the politician Dimitar Petkov. His brother Petko Petkov was shot dead by an unknown assassin in 1924. Nikola Petkov was among the founders of the Fatherland Front (FF) in 1943 and participated in the establishment of the new government before becoming its target.  Early years  He graduated from the 1st Sofia Boys High School in 1910 and after that studied law and politics at the Sorbonne, Paris. He returned to Bulgaria to participate in the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913) serving in a Guards regiment. After World War I Petkov continued his studies in Paris and graduated with excellent marks in 1922. He worked in the Bulgarian legation in Paris. After the coup of 9 June 1923 when the BZNS government under Aleksandar Stamboliyski was removed from office, Nikola Petkov resigned and stayed in France where he worked as a journalist.

He prepared and published a book on Aleksandar Stamboliyski in which he made political analysis and characteristics on the personality and the activities of the agrarian leader. After the coup of 19 May 1934 Petkov cooperated with democratic parties including the Labours' Party ‚Äì the legal organization of the banned Bulgarian Communist Party. He was elected to the 24th National Assembly (1938‚Äì1939). Due to his anti-fascist activity his election as a member of the parliament was invalidated in December 1938 and Nikola Petkov was interned in Ivailovgrad. After Dr G. M. Dimitrov emigrated in 1941, Nikola Petkov took the leadership of BZNS \\"Aleksandar Stamboliyski\\". That same year he was sent to the Gonda Voda camp. He negotiated with the other democratic parties for the establishment of the Fatherland Front and represented BZNS in the national council of the FF. In 1943 Nikola Petkov was interned in Svishtov where he continued with his political activity and was engaged in the organization of the FF. He was meeting with Kosta Lulchev and other political activists. Petkov returned to Sofia in the summer of 1944.  Political activity  Memorial plaque on the facade of the house, where Petkov lived from July 1944 to June 1947 The house on 12 Tsar Ivan Shishman Str., Sofia From 9 September 1944 to 26 August 1945 he was a minister without portfolio in the first government of the FF. From January 1945 he became a leader of the anti-communist United opposition. From 26 November 1946 he was an MP in the 6th Great National Assembly. His struggle to preserve parliamentary democracy was viewed by the communists as a form of counter-revolutionary activity. His parliamentary immunity was lifted on 5 June 1947 and he was arrested in the Parliament building itself; colleagues who tried to prevent the arrest were beaten up.Gellately, Robert, Stalin's Curse Battling for Communism in War and Cold War, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 2013, p 249 After a show trial in which the defence was denied the rights to legal representation or to present evidence, he was found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death on 16 August that year.Crampton, R. J. A Concise History of Bulgaria, p.186. Cambridge University Press (2005), Though he protested his innocence during his staged group trial with four other 'co-conspirators,' and despite the protests of Western nations, Nikola Petkov was tortured and murdered with a hammer. His corpse was then hanged on 23 September 1947 and buried in an unknown grave. The Bulgarian secret police arranged for a false confession to be publicly printed after Petkov's death, but it was so obviously faked that the move quickly became an embarrassment and ceased to be mentioned by the authorities.Judt, Tony Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, p. 175. Penguin Press (2005), Petkov had been denied a Christian burial or last rites, despite being one of Bulgaria's few genuinely religious public figures.Crampton, R. J.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Career =Toronto Blue Jays = V√©lez's career began when the Toronto Blue Jays signed him on August 27, 2001. He had to beg his mother, who wanted him to be an engineer, to sign for him (because he was only 19), but she reluctantly did. He began his professional career with the Pulaski Blue Jays in 2003. After three solid years in the minors, he was selected by the San Francisco Giants from the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2005 minor league Rule 5 draft.http://www.baseball-america.com/today/news/051208rule5.html =San Francisco Giants = In 2006, the Giants assigned V√©lez to the A Augusta GreenJackets. He had an exceptional year, winning the South Atlantic League's Most Valuable Player award. He won the award by batting .315 with 63 extra base hits, 64 stolen bases and organization-high 91 runs batted in.http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070304&content;_id=186794&vkey;=news_milb&fext;=.jsp The following year, he was placed on the Giants' 40-man roster.http://www.baseballforum.com/san-francisco-giants-2007-40-man.html He started the year with the AA Connecticut Defenders, but he played so well he earned a promotion to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies. However, he only played four games with Fresno before the Giants called him up for the first time. He made his debut on September 5, as a pinch hitter, as the Giants beat the Colorado Rockies 5-3.http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2007/B09050COL2007.htm He finished the year with four stolen bases, although he only had three hits in 11 at-bats (in addition to two walks). In 2008, V√©lez made the Giants out of spring training, but he was sent down to the Grizzlies in May for Travis Denker. After playing well at Fresno, though, he was recalled on July 8, 2008. On August 30, 2008, he hit his first career home run against the Cincinnati Reds.http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2008/B08300CIN2008.htm In 2009, V√©lez once again made the Giants out of spring training. He would play in both San Francisco and Fresno during the year, but he spent the majority of time with the Giants. He finished the year with an acceptable .267 batting average. V√©lez made the Opening Day roster in 2010. His first appearance of the season came in the Giants' 10-4 victory to complete a three-game sweep of the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park on April 7. He entered the contest replacing Mark DeRosa in left field as part of a double switch in the seventh inning.

V√©lez' poor play during the start of the '10 season led to his removal from the Giants active roster when the Giants acquired Pat Burrell. He was called up at times during the later part of the '10 season. On July 26, while sitting in the dugout during a Giants' 10-4 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, V√©lez was struck in the head by a foul ball, coincidentally off the bat of Burrell, and hospitalized briefly afterward. He was placed on the disabled list for a short time after that, but was eventually pronounced fine. However, coincidentally or not, once Velez returned to action in August, he would go hitless (in 9 at-bats) for the rest of the season, and then 0-for-37 the following season with the Los Angeles Dodgers (although he would hit well over .300 in minor league action in 2011.) =Los Angeles Dodgers= On December 13, 2010 he signed a minor league contract with an invite to spring training with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He joined the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. He hit .339 in 55 games with the Isotopes and on July 4, 2011 he was called up to the Dodgers. On August 22, V√©lez tied J. D. Drew for the worst offensive start for the Dodgers since 1919 by failing to get a hit in his first 25 at-bats. On September 23, he struck out three times to break a 75-year-old record for most at-bats in a season without a hit (36) and tie a 102-year-old record for most consecutive at-bats without a hit spanning more than one season (45).Kemp belts 37th as Dodgers top Padres In the last game of the season, V√©lez ground out as a pinch hitter in the eighth inning, finishing the year 0-for-37, the most at-bats in a season without a hit by a position player in Major League history. He also extended his overall hitless streak to 46 at-bats, breaking the record previously shared by Bill Bergen, Dave Campbell and Craig Counsell. On April 8, 2019, Chris Davis of the Baltimore Orioles broke the record when he recorded his 47th consecutive at bat without a hit.

It also provided a hub of social and cultural activities for the local residents. John Charles Cawood was appointed Government Resident of Central Australia in 1926 and was to be based at the capital, Stuart (as Alice Springs was formerly known). Description The Residency was one of a type of house designed for an arid climate. The building had foundations, but the concrete floors were laid directly onto the earth. The hollow concrete bricks, which resembled stone, were made on site in wooden sculpted moulds. Only one type of brick was actually used, but was concealed by a varied laying pattern. Cawood telegraphed the Department of Home and Territories pointing out that sand suitable for cement could be found in the Todd River. The building was completed in 1927. The main feature of the building was a breezeway running through the centre of the house. This area was mainly used as the lounge in the earlier days. It was fitted out with cane furniture and a tea table. The main hall was cooled by a punkah (which is still in use today) and was operated by an Aboriginal servant. Rooms opened off each side of the breezeway and a wide fly-wired veranda enclosed the building. Today the veranda is enclosed by wooden framed sliding opaque windows. There are green striped canvas blinds to keep the building cool. The Residency has undergone some major renovations during its occupation as a home. The front room to the left of the entrance was originally the laundry and storeroom. Mrs Carrington (occupied the Residency from 1929‚Äì1942) often had to vacate her bedroom when accommodating married couples and this became undesirable. It had been suggested to build two extra rooms onto the back of the house out from the kitchen ‚Äì one being a storeroom and the other being a laundry. This allowed a new bedroom to be completed for the occupants of The Residency. The new bedroom thrilled Mrs Carrington because the morning sun streamed through the windows. The main breezeway (jokingly called 'the freezeway' during the winter) later became a dining area. With the different families living in The Residency this area often changed to suit the occupants. There were 4 fireplaces ‚Äì one in each of the main rooms. Doors opened onto the veranda to keep the house warm in winter and cool in summer. Alice Springs can be very cold during the winter and of course extremely hot in the summer.  Occupants  John Charles Cawood was the Government Resident from February 1927 until December 1929. Even though Cawood was the Administrator, he was also put in charge of the three-member Commission of Inquiry in 1928. Mr Cawood handed over his position to his deputy as Mrs Cawood was suffering from poor health. Victor Carrington occupied The Residency as the Assistant administrator (this position was abolished with the repealing of the North Australia Act, 1926 in 1931) and later as District Officer. The Carrington family lived at the Residency from 1929 until 1942. Aubrey Abbott was the Administrator of the Northern Territory and was living in Darwin. After almost being killed during the Bombing of Darwin in 1942, he moved the Administrative Centre from Darwin to Alice Springs, and Mr Abbott remained at the Residency until November 1945. LH A Giles was then the Government Secretary of the Northern Territory and he stayed in The Residency for a very short time just until May 1946. Colonel Lionel Rose was a very 'colourful character' and many stories were told of his bushcraft and love of life. Colonel Rose was the Chief Veterinary for the Northern Territory. The locals have suggested that The Residency was a focal point in the social life of the community while Colonel Rose occupied it from July 1946 until February 1955. Reginald McCaffery, his wife Billie and his large family followed Colonel Rose. McCaffery found the number of bedrooms inadequate. He organised some internal partitions on the veranda to accommodate his family and these areas were furnished quite plainly, in some cases just a bed, chair and table. Reginald McCaffery lived in The Residency from February 1955 until December 1960. Dan Conway with his wife Jillna was the last District Officer to occupy the building before it was handed over to the Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory. The Conways undertook fairly extensive renovations for the Royal Visit to Central Australia in 1963. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh slept in The Residency for 2 nights (14‚Äì16 March). To accommodate the Royal Party a new roof, air conditioning and the installation of two new bathrooms were added. Part of the veranda near the Queens bedroom was a private area for the Queen to read her daily correspondence and the programme for daily events. The Conways lived at The Residency from December 1960 until July 1973. When Alice Springs became a municipality in 1973, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory assumed control and used the historic building to display items of art, natural science and local history.The History of Alice Springs through landmarks and street names, (Jose Petrick), pp 160‚Äì1 The Residency was re- opened by the Chief Minister of the NT, Shane Stone, on 9 February 1996, and is now the home of Heritage Alice Springs Inc. Open to the public, visitors can experience the atmosphere of the gracious home which was the social, administrative and vice-regal hub of the early township of Alice Springs.The History of Alice Springs through landmarks and street names (Jose Petrick), pp 160‚Äì1 Heritage listings The Residency was listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register on 14 July 1995. In 1987, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

He was born at Pesaro. He was instructed in painting by Francesco Mancini, and studied at Rome from 1734 to 1749, and worked subsequently at Venice and Forl√¨ in a style recalling Carlo Cignani. He distinguished himself as a fresco-painter. He was, however, a better teacher than artist.

He was a professor at the Academy of Pesaro from 1753.Biografia degli artisti by Filippo de Boni, page 542. Among his pupils were Pietro Marchioretto. His works were painted for Gualdo, near Rimini, and for the Cathedrals of Osimo, Foligno, Ancona, and Pesaro. He also painted for the church of Sant'Agostino in Pesaro. He died in Pesaro.
