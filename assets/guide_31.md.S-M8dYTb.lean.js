In 1929, as a young man, he joined the Communist Party. He was detained in a succession of prisons and concentration camps between 1933 and 1939, at which point he was deprived of his citizenship. By 1939 it was no longer so easy as it had been earlier in the decade for Germany's political refugees to find refuge elsewhere in Europe, but he was able to emigrate to China where he supported himself with journalistic and translation work between 1939 and 1947.  Life  Walter Czollek was born in the Charlottenburg quarter of Berlin into a German-Jewish family. His father was a businessman. He had a conventional schooling, attending a Gymnasium (secondary school) locally and successfully completing his School final exams (\\"Abitur\\"). However, instead of progressing directly to university, in 1924 he embarked on a commercial apprenticeship, mastering the production and processing of artificial silk fabrics. He continued to work in the business till 1933. Between 1928 and 1930 he also undertook a study course in Applied Economics (\\"Volkswirtschaft\\") at the German Academy of Politics in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg. It was during this time, in 1929, that he joined the Communist Party. He worked secretly in the party's quasi-military \\"M-Apparat\\" (\\"Milit√§rpolitischen Apparat\\" / \\"Military-political structure\\") between 1929 and 1933. R√©gime change in January 1933, followed by the Reichstag fire in February 1933, signalled a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship. Those who were or had been active Communist Party members found themselves at the top of the government's target list, and many escaped arrest only by fleeing abroad, mostly (in the early years) to Prague, Paris and Moscow. During 1933/34 Walter Czollek was arrested twice. In 1934 he was sentenced to two years in prison. He served his sentence at the penitentiaries in Berlin's Prince Albrecht Street and Luckau, before being transferred, in 1936, to Lichtenburg concentration camp. He was moved to Dachau concentration camp in 1937, and in 1938 to Buchenwald concentration camp where he was held, mostly, in isolation and subjected to serious mistreatment. He was eventually released and expelled from Germany in May 1939. He arrived in Shanghai on 17 July 1939, and met by Max Lewinsohn and Alfred Dreifuss.Alfred Dreifuss who shared Walter Czollek's Shanghai exile is apparently unconnected with the better remembered French artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935). Czollek was found a room in an apartment in Ward Road. Through Dreifuss he was introduced to Richard Paulick who operated what amounted to a \\"political salon\\" at the heart of a small but committed community of exiled German communists. Between 1939 and 1941 he headed up an illegal radio station on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, also carrying out tasks for a Soviet news and information service, while also supporting himself by working in various chemicals companies. Up till 1945 he was passing military information to various news agencies. Between 1939 and 1947 he also worked as a translator and radio presenter for the German language TASS station \\"Voice of the Soviet Union in Shanghai\\" (\\"Stimme der Sowjetunion in Shanghai\\"). Czollek was a co- founder and later a leader of the Communist Party of Germany exile group in China, and after the war in Europe ended, in November 1945 he was a co-founder of the \\"Residents Association of Democratic Germans\\" in Shanghai. In August 1947 Walter Czollek returned from Shanghai to the part of Germany which, since May 1945, had been administered as the Soviet occupation zone of what had previously been Germany. He took a job with the \\"Treuhandverwaltung\\", responsible for administering confiscated and sequestered property in the Soviet (eastern) part of Berlin. In 1948/49 he took a senior position with the personnel office of the Berlin Chamber of Industry and Commerce.. During this time, in October 1949, the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic, a new kind of German one-party dictatorship, sponsored by the Soviet Union, and with its defining social and political structures modelled on those of the Soviet Union itself. Between 1950 and 1952 he was employed by the Verlag Volk und Welt (publishing house) as a reader on the then crucially important subject of contemporary history. During 1952 he attended a course at the party's \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" Academy for National Administration (\\"... Akademie f√ºr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft\\"), after which he became deputy head of the \\"Verlag Volk und Welt\\". In 1954 he succeeded Bruno Peterson as head (\\"Verlagsleiter\\") of the operation, a position he retained for eighteen years till his death in 1972.

The Philippine peso is ultimately derived from the Spanish peso or pieces of eight brought over in large quantities by the Manila galleons of the 16th to 19th centuries. From the same Spanish peso or dollar is derived the various pesos of Latin America, the dollars of the US and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen. History Long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines in 1521, the Filipinos had established trade relations with neighboring lands like China, Java, Borneo, Thailand and other settlements. Barter was a system of trading commonly practiced throughout the world and adopted by the Philippines. The inconvenience of the barter system led to the adoption of a specific medium of exchange ‚Äì the cowry shells. Cowries produced in gold, jade, quartz and wood became the most common and acceptable form of money through many centuries. The Philippines is naturally rich in gold, making possible the availability of local gold coinage called piloncitos. The original silver currency unit was the rupee or rupiah (known locally as salapi), brought over by trade with India and Indonesia. The salapi continued under Spanish rule as a teston worth four reales or half a Spanish peso. Archaic period (c. 900 AD‚Äì1565) =Piloncitos= A collection of Piloncitos in Manila Mint Museum. Piloncitos were used in Tondo, Namayan and Rajahnate of Butuan in present-day Philippines. Piloncitos are tiny engraved bead-like gold bits unearthed in the Philippines. They are the first recognized coinage in the Philippines circulated between the 9th and 12th centuries. They emerged when increasing trade made barter inconvenient. Piloncitos are so small‚Äîsome are of the size of a corn kernel‚Äîand weigh from 0.09 to 2.65 grams of fine gold. Large Piloncitos weigh almost 1 mace, or 1/10th of a tael. Piloncitos have been excavated from Mandaluyong, Bataan, the banks of the Pasig River, Batangas, Marinduque, Samar, Leyte and some areas in Mindanao. They have been found in large numbers in Indonesian archeological sites leading to questions of origin. That gold was mined and worked here is evidenced by many Spanish accounts, like one in 1586 that said: =Barter rings= The gold currencies: (upper part) the Piloncitos and the Barter rings (lower part). The early Filipinos also traded along with the Barter rings, which is gold ring-like ingots. These barter rings are bigger than a doughnut in size and are made of nearly pure gold.  Spanish era (1565‚Äì1898)  columnario peso imported from Spanish Latin America 1726‚Äì1770. Spanish gold onza or 8 escudo coin imported from Spanish Latin America and valued at 16 silver pesos. Silver 50-centimo coin issued 1864 until the 1890s The Spanish silver peso worth eight reales was first introduced by the Magellan expedition of 1521 and brought in large quantities by the Manila galleons after the 1565 conquest of the Philippines. See Spanish dollar. The local salapi continued under Spanish rule as a half-peso coin. Additionally, Spanish gold onzas or eight-escudo coins were also introduced with identical weight to the Spanish dollar but valued at 16 silver pesos. = Silver Cobs and Columnarios = The earliest silver coins brought in by the galleons from Mexico and other Spanish colonies were in the form of roughly-cut cobs or macuquinas. These coins usually bore a cross on one side and the Spanish royal coat-of-arms on the other. Locals called these crudely-made coins \\"hilis-kalamay\\" due to its resemblance to flattened rice cakes. These were replaced starting 1726 by machine-minted coins called Columnarios (pillar dollars) or dos mundos (two worlds) containing 27.07 grams of 0.917 fine silver (revised to 0.903 fine in 1771). These pillar dollars circulated extensively not only in the Philippines but all over the world in the 18th and 19th centuries due to its beauty of design, consistency of weight and fineness, universal recognition among merchants worldwide, and a serrated edge which prevented the clipping away of the precious metal. From the same Spanish peso or dollar is derived the various pesos of Latin America, the dollars of the US and Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen. = Fractional currency and Cuartos = Silver coins were minted in denominations of 8 real ($1) and 4, 2, 1 and 1/2 real. Gold coins came in denominations of 8 escudos ($16) and 4, 2, 1 and 1/2 escudos. Small change was also made by cutting a whole $1 coin, most commonly into eight wedges each worth one Spanish real. Locally produced crude copper or bronze coins called cuartos or barrillas were also struck in the Philippines by order of the Spanish government. From this came the Filipino words ‚Äúkwarta‚Äù (synonymous to money in general) and ‚Äúbarya‚Äù (small change). In 1837 an order was issued that 20 such cuartos be counted as one real (hence, 160 cuartos to a peso). The discontinuation in the 19th century of officially minted copper cuartos was alleviated in part by counterfeit two-cuarto coins (worth 80 to a peso) made by Igorot copper miners in the Cordilleras and accepted in circulation by the rest of the country. = Stamped Philippine Currency = In the early part of the 19th century, most of the Spanish colonies in Central and South America revolted and declared independence from Spain. They issued silver coins bearing revolutionary slogans and symbols which reached the Philippines. The Spanish government officials in the islands were fearful that the seditious markings would incite Filipinos to rebellion. Thus they removed the inscriptions by counter stamping the coins with the word F7 or YII. A currency system derived from coins imported from Spain, China and neighboring countries was fraught with various difficulties. Money came in different coinages, and fractional currency in addition to the real and the cuarto also existed. Peso coins with Spanish or Mexican designs are also easily imported and exported overseas, occasionally emptying government and private coffers. Money has nearly always been scarce in Manila, and when it was abundant it was shipped to the provinces. An 1857 decree requiring the keeping of accounts in pesos and centimos (worth 1/100th of a peso) was of little help to the situation given the existence of copper cuartos worth 160 to a peso. = Philippine Gold / Silver Bimetallic Standard in the 19th Century = The Spanish gold onza (or 8-escudo coin) was of identical weight to the Spanish dollar but was officially valued at 16 silver pesos, thus putting the peso on a bimetallic standard with a gold/silver ratio of 16. Its divergence with the value of gold in international trade featured prominently in the continued monetary crises of the 19th century. The California gold rush of 1848-1855 meant the gold onza, officially valued at 16 pesos, fetched only about 15 pesos internationally, and it in fact suffered as much as a 33% discount when paid to Chinese merchants who consistently count in silver pesos. As the Spanish government continued to receive these gold onzas as 16 pesos, there eventually came a time when silver pesos became scarce and only gold 16-peso coins remained in circulation. In order to remedy this damage in the monetary situation, Queen Isabella II issued a decree in 1857 ordering the founding of the Casa de Moneda de Manila in the Philippines in order to coin gold 1, 2 and 4 peso coins according to Spanish standards (the 4-peso coin being 6.766 grams of 0.875 gold). The first gold coins were minted in 1861. In the same year a royal decree ordered the minting of 50, 20 and 10 centimo silver coins out of Latin American coins also according to Spanish standards (with 100 centimos containing 25.98 grams of 0.900 silver). The price of silver has since gone down and the first silver coins were minted in 1864. The relative abundance of gold in the Philippines then came to an end with the adoption of the gold standard in most of Europe after 1871 and the subsequent climb in the international gold/silver ratio above 16. It was further aggravated by an 1876 decree confirming the Mexican peso as legal tender in the Philippines and exchangeable with the gold onza for 16 pesos. The climb in the gold onza's overseas value above 16 pesos soon made importing Mexican dollars in exchange for gold coins a profitable venture. While the Governor General attempted in 1877 to stem the outflow of gold by limiting the legal tender status of Mexican silver, by 1884 gold coin had entirely disappeared. The 19th century therefore ended with the Philippine peso still officially on a bimetallic standard equal to either the silver Mexican peso (weighing 27.07 grams 0.903 fine, or 0.786 troy ounce XAG) or 1/16th the gold onza (weighing 1.6915 gram 0.875 fine, or 0.0476 troy ounce XAU). The gold peso, however, has since increased in value to approx. two silver pesos. Furthermore, the fineness of Philippine fractional silver coins was reduced from 0.900 to 0.835 and worsened the quality of the local currency, and the introduction of Alfonsino silver coins in 1897 did little to improve the peso's exchange value. Such Mexican and Spanish-Filipino coins remained in circulation until they were demonetized after the introduction of the new US-Philippine peso in 1903. = Peso Fuerte Banknotes = The first paper money circulated in the Philippines was the Philippine peso fuerte issued in 1851 by the country's first bank, the El Banco Espa√±ol Filipino de Isabel II. Being bimetallic and convertible to either silver pesos or gold onzas, its volume of 1,800,000 pesos was small relative to about 40,000,000 silver pesos in circulation at the end of the 19th century. =Sulu coins= The Sultanate of Sulu in the southernmost islands engaged actively in barter trade with the Arabs, Han Chinese, Bornean, Moluccan, and British traders. The Sultans issued coins of their own as early as the 5th century. Coins of Sultan Azimud Din that exist today are of base metal Tin, Silver and alloy bearing Arabic inscriptions and dated 1148 AH corresponding to the year 1735 in the Christian era. First Philippine Republic (Revolutionary period 1898‚Äì1901) Peso note of the First Philippine Republic. Asserting its independence after the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898, the Rep√∫blica Filipina (Philippine Republic) under General Emilio Aguinaldo issued its own coins and paper currency backed by the country's natural resources. The coins were the first to use the name centavo for the subdivision of the peso. The island of Panay also issued revolutionary coinage. After Aguinaldo's capture by American forces in Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901, the revolutionary peso ceased to exist. American colonial period (1901‚Äì1946) US Administration 50 centavos silver coin minted in San Francisco in 1918. After the United States took control of the Philippines, the United States Congress passed the Philippine Coinage Act of 1903, established the unit of currency to be a theoretical gold peso (not coined) consisting of 12.9 grains of gold 0.900 fine (0.0241875 XAU), equivalent to ‚Ç±2,640 as of 22 December 2010.0.0241875 XAU = 2,640 PHP, xe.com. This unit was equivalent to exactly half the value of a U.S. dollar. Its peg to gold was maintained until the gold content of the US dollar was reduced in 1934. Its peg of ‚Ç±2 to the US dollar was maintained until independence in 1946. The act provided for the coinage and issuance of Philippine silver pesos substantially of the weight and fineness as the Mexican peso, which should be of the value of 50 cents gold and redeemable in gold at the insular treasury, and which was intended to be the sole circulating medium among the people. The act also provided for the coinage of subsidiary and minor coins and for the issuance of silver certificates in denominations of not less than 2 nor more than 10 pesos (maximum denomination increased to 500 pesos in 1906). It also provided for the creation of a gold- standard fund to maintain the parity of the coins so authorized to be issued and authorized the insular government to issue temporary certificates of indebtedness bearing interest at a rate not to exceed 4 per cent per annum, payable not more than one year from date of issue, to an amount which should not at any one time exceed 10 million dollars or 20 million pesos. Commonwealth period (1935‚Äì1946) 1944 Philippines five Centavo coin When the Philippines became a U.S. Commonwealth in 1935, the coat of arms of the Philippine Commonwealth were adopted and replaced the arms of the US Territories on the reverse of coins while the obverse remained unchanged. This seal is composed of a much smaller eagle with its wings pointed up, perched over a shield with peaked corners, above a scroll reading \\"Commonwealth of the Philippines\\". It is a much busier pattern, and widely considered less attractive. =The \\"Mickey Mouse money\\" (Fiat peso)= The peso issued by the Japanese government nicknamed as \\"The Mickey Mouse money\\". During World War II in the Philippines, the occupying Japanese government-issued fiat currency in several denominations; this is known as the Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso (see also Japanese invasion money). The Second Philippine Republic under Jos√© P. Laurel outlawed possession of guerrilla currency, and declared a monopoly on the issuance of money, so that anyone found to possess guerrilla notes could be arrested. Some Filipinos called the fiat peso \\"Mickey Mouse money\\". Many survivors of the war tell stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \\"bay√≥ng\\" (native bags made of woven coconut or buri leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. According to one witness, 75 \\"Mickey Mouse\\" pesos, or about 35 U.S. dollars at that time, could buy one duck egg. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos.Agoncillo, Teodoro A. & Guerrero, Milagros C., History of the Filipino People, 1986, R.P. Garcia Publishing Company, Quezon City, Philippines =\\"Guerilla Pesos\\" (Emergency circulating notes)= 5 centavo emergency circulating note, Apayo The Emergency circulating notes were currency printed by the Philippine Commonwealth Government in exile during World War II. These \\"guerrilla pesos\\" were printed by local government units and banks using crude inks and materials. Due to the inferior quality of these bills, they were easily mutilated. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic under President Jos√© P. Laurel outlawed possession of guerrilla currency and declared a monopoly on the issuance of money and anyone found to possess guerrilla notes could be arrested or even executed. Modern currencies (1946‚Äìpresent) =English Series= The two peso note of the English series. The English Series were Philippine banknotes that circulated from 1951 to 1971. It was the only banknote series of the Philippine peso to use English as the language. =Pilipino series= The Pilipino series banknotes is the name used to refer to Philippine banknotes issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines from 1969 to 1973, during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos.

It is important to note that very little can be found regarding his life and work, though he is listed in many, if not nearly all, of the early academic descriptions and writings surrounding kuru. While little is known about his early life, he was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1920, studied medicine at a number of European universities, including those in \\"Kaunas, Koeningsberg, Breslau, and Hamburg,\\" and spoke a number of different languages. In 1948, he moved to Australia. After a four month long course at the Australian School of Pacific Administration taught by Camilla Wedgewood and James McAuley (spelled McCauley by Zigas), Zigas went to Papua New Guinea in 1950 where he was the only medical officer in his region. It was here that he began to hear rumors of a unique illness characterized by body tremors, ataxia, and uncontrollable laughter found only in the Fore tribe that the locals attributed to sorcery. These rumors led him to seek out the Fore and he began to look into this disease, known by the locals as kuru which meant \\"to shiver.\\" While certain accounts say that D. Carleton Gajdusek simply appeared in Papua New Guinea, others note that his trip spurred from a connection in Australia. Regardless of how Gajdusek arrived, the American physician immediately began to pepper Zigas with questions surrounding the mysterious disease kuru and in that year (1957), Zigas introduced Gajdusek to the Fore tribe. After conducting autopsies, attempting treatments, and characterizing the illness, together, Zigas and Gajdusek published \\"Degenerative Disease of the Central Nervous System in New Guinea ‚Äî The Endemic Occurrence of Kuru in the Native Population\\" in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 1957. While this article noted the manifestations of kuru, its associated geography, and certain findings from lab tests and autopsies, the authors could only speculate on the disease's cause and how it was transmitted. More importantly, this article put kuru on the map and served as an introduction to future investigations into the origins, transmission, and causes of it. In the years after these investigations, Zigas published two autobiographical books about his time in Papua New Guinea characterizing kuru. The first, Auscultation of Two Worlds was published in 1978 and the second, Laughing Death, was published posthumously in 1990.

A similar condition, dead-vagina syndrome has been asserted to exist in women. Concept Death-grip syndrome, sometimes abbreviated as DGS, was arguably coined in 2003 by sex columnist Dan Savage and is an issue that affects both men and women. However, others have attributed it to normal masturbation that is excessive. For females the slang term used is \\"dead vagina syndrome.\\" Although men with the indisposition may still experience an erection, it may embroil a relationship negatively due to a sense of being sexually incompatible with a partner due to the habit of lasting too long during sexual activity, and subsequent side-effects such as blue balls or inhibited ejaculation.POLONSKY, DEREK C. \\"The Sexual Challenges and Dilemmas of Young Single Men.\\" Handbook of Clinical Sexuality for Mental Health Professionals (2011): 231. Some people who have claimed to \\"experience the death-grip\\" state that although they can still experience pleasure, the typical vagina feels too loose, and fellatio provides insufficient friction to produce an orgasm.Flemons, Douglas, and Shelley Green. \\"Just between us: A relational approach to sex therapy.\\" Quickies: The handbook of brief sex therapy (2004): 126-170. Richard Santucci, chief of urology at Detroit Receiving Hospital's Center for Urologic Reconstruction, believes that \\"too strong masturbation\\" is not a common cause of delayed ejaculation, and states that \\"diabetes, medications, low testosterone, anxiety\\" are the common causes. Perception The concept of death-grip syndrome is not recognized by any mainstream medical bodies. Some analysts have argued that sexual techniques that have a vacuum effect, such as oral pompoir or vaginal pompoir could alleviate DGS.Ruuhilahti, Susanna. \\"Good Sex‚ÄìEnhancing Wellbeing in Sexuality Education by Utilizing Stories.\\" in Proceedings of 2012 NACS conference in Helsinki; page 135. Some analysts have argued that there are other forms of social conditioning ingrained during adolescence that occur concurrently with DGS, such as a reluctance among men to make audible sounds of pleasure such as moaning. Such silence during sex is learned from growing up in one's household and attempting to remain discreet when around first and second-degree relatives.Melnick, Alexandra S. \\"But What Does ‚ÄúIt‚Äù Mean: An Analysis of Feminist & Mainstream Pornographies.\\" (2016).

ECCE has a global scope, and caring for and educating young children has always been an integral part of human societies. Arrangements for fulfilling these societal roles have evolved over time and remain varied across cultures, often reflecting family and community structures as well as the social and economic roles of women and men. Historically, such arrangements have largely been informal, involving family, household and community members. The formalization of these arrangements emerged in the nineteenth century with the establishment of kindergartens for educational purposes and day nurseries for care in much of Europe and North America, Brazil, China, India, Jamaica and Mexico.Kamerman, S. B. 2006. A global history of early childhood education and care. Background paper for EFA Global Monitoring Report 2007. State-led expansion of ECCE services first emerged in the Russian Federation in the early twentieth century as part of the socialist project to foster equal participation of women and men in production and in public life, and to publicly provide education from the youngest possible age.Taratukhina, M. S., Polyakova, M. N., Berezina, T. A., Notkina, N. A., Sheraizina, R. M., Borovkov, M. I. 2006. Early childhood care and education in the Russian Federation. Background paper for EFA Global Monitoring Report 2007. This development extended to socialist or former socialist countries such as Cambodia, China and Viet Nam.Haddad, L. 2002. An Integrated Approach to Early Childhood Education and Care. UNESCO Early Childhood and Family Policy Series, No. 3. Paris, UNESCO. France was another early starter having integrated pre-school into its education system as early as 1886 and expanded its provision in the 1950s. In real terms, the significant expansion of ECCE services began in the 1960s with the considerable growth in women's participation in the labour market and extensive developments in child and family policies in Europe and the United States of America.  ECCE development in 1990s  The 1990s opened a new page in the history of the development of ECCE catalysed mainly by the rapid and successive ratification of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). By its explicit mention of 'the child' ‚Äì meaning every human being under the age of eighteen or majority ‚Äì the CRC reinforced the 1960 UNESCO Convention and Recommendation against Discrimination in Education which should have covered young children in any case. With its moral force and near universal ratification, the CRC formally recognized children as holders of rights to survival and development, to be heard and to participate in decisions affecting them in accordance with their evolving capacities with their best interests and non-discrimination as overarching principles. While the CRC in Article 18 also recognizes the primary role of parents and legal guardians in the upbringing and development of children, it obliges States Parties to help them carry out these duties. The second boost to the development of ECCE was the adoption of the World Declaration on Education for All (EFA) in March 1990 in Jomtien, Thailand. Reflecting General Comment 7, the Jomtien Declaration explicitly stated that 'learning begins at birth', and called for 'early childhood care and initial education' (Article 5). This novel recognition of ECCE as an integral part of basic education featured again in the major goals adopted at the 1990 UN World Summit for Children. Ten years later, in 2000, this expanded vision of basic education was rearmed in the Dakar Framework for Action on EFA, adopted at the World Education Forum as the first of the six EFA goals: 'Expanding and improving comprehensive ECCE especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children'. Regrettably, unlike other EFA goals, this was stated as a broad and aspirational goal without numerical targets or clear benchmarks.  ECCE Development in the 21st century  ECCE was further reinforced by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), albeit only partially. Adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, two of the MDGs had direct relevance to early childhood development: (i) improving maternal health, with the targets of reducing the maternal mortality rates by three-quarters and providing universal access to reproductive health (MDG4), and (ii) reducing the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 (MDG5). Thus, the child and maternal health aspects of ECCE became part and parcel of a global 'effort to meet the needs of the world's poorest' while childcare and early education aspects were left out. In recent decades, ECCE has further received attention from diverse stakeholders including research communities, civil society and intergovernmental organizations which furthered understanding of its holistic and multisectoral nature. Research continues to document the multifaceted development benefits of ECCE for health, education, social and emotional well-being, social equity and cohesion, the economy, employment and earnings.

According to local reports, victims of a so-called rent-sangla (rent-mortgage) scam said they later found out that they had fallen victim to fraudulent promises of rental income when they later found their vehicles had either been mortgaged or sold to different persons without their knowledge. Eight persons, five of them from Laguna province, had been charged for violations of Article 315 of the Philippines' Revised Penal Code (on swindling/estafa in large-scale form) and in relation to Presidential Decree 1689 (which increased the penalty of certain forms of swindling/estafa). Fearing that the suspects would leave the country, the victims asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) to issue immigration lookout bulletins/orders against suspects Martin Perez, Tychicus Historillo Nambio, Rafaela Anunciacion (the supposed mastermind of the scam), and Lea Constantino Rosales. DOJ Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre then announced that about 500 cars had already been seized by law enforcers in Cavite and Laguna. Anunciacion was arrested on 2 March in Laguna by members of the Philippine National Police Regional Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), but she was able to post a bail of ‚Ç±40,000. 200 complaints have been filed against Anunciacion and Nambio. In mid-March 2017, Aguirre announced that the NBI would be filing its own complaint against the persons behind the scam. He also noted that 184 out of 300 vehicles snatched by the scheme have been returned to their respective owners. According to PNP-HPG, around 1,800 vehicles have reportedly been victimized by the scheme, but that 107 of confirmed 457 stolen vehicles were recovered during police operations in Metro Manila, Southern Tagalog, and Central Luzon. On August 25, 2018, the alleged mastermind Rafaela Anunciacion was arrested again by the PNP-HPG.

Now, with its 25 programs the college has two campuses, one in Cappadocia ‚Äì Nev≈üehir and the other, at Istanbul Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport.  History  Starting in 2005-2006 academic year with five programs designed to meet the regional development targets, Cappadocia Vocational College currently continues its educational activities in 25 associate degree programs in two campuses, in Cappadocia and at Sabiha G√∂k√ßen Airport respectively. Since 2009, focusing on the area of civil aviation, the college has introduced and opened Hot Air Balloon Piloting, Aircraft Technology, Civil Aviation Management in English, Civil Aviation Cabin Services and Flight Dispatcher programs and established a second campus at Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport in 2011 with the support of Defense Industry Undersecretariat in addition to the trainings and education delivered at Cappadocia campus. In 2012, parallel to the development targets of the health sector and the demand for qualified workforce in this area, the College has concentrated on health programs. Consequently, in 2011-2012 academic year, Child Development program; in 2012-2013 academic year Oral and Dental Care, Operating Room Services, Dialysis, Physiotherapy and Medical Imaging Techniques were established. The following academic year, Anesthesia, Electroneurophysiology, First and Emergency Aid, Audiometry, Opticianry programs; then, in 2014-2015 academic year, Medical Laboratory Techniques, Health Tourism Management, Social Services and Pathology Laboratory Techniques programs were started. Finally, in 2015-2016 academic year Dental Prosthetics Technology program was included among the others. In 2014, fully equipped training areas were formed to carry out the practical trainings required for First and Emergency Aid, Medical Imaging Techniques, Operating Room Services, Dialysis, Audiometry, Opticianry programs. Furthermore, four centers were established in the same year under the names of Oral and Dental Care Application and Research Center, Child Development Application and Research Center, Physical Therapy and Wellness Application and Research Center and Continuous Education Center to support the practical training of the programs in Cappadocia Vocational College. The Distance Education Unit was established in 2013, and started to enrol Tourist Guidance program students in 2014-2015 academic year, and Child Development program students the following year.

Location Kinloch Rannoch The hotel is on the east edge of Loch Rannoch, on the village square in Kinloch Rannoch, within Perth and Kinross, Scotland. History =Alexander Robertson and the Jacobite rising = The land on which the hotel is sited was originally owned by the Clan Donnachaidh. In 1745 the clan's then-chief, Alexander Robertson was defeated in battle during the Jacobite rising and all of the clan's land was sold to the crown, and only later restored to Robertson's ancestors in 1782, 33 years after his death. Looking to resettle in the wake of their defeat at the Battle of Culloden, the few surviving soldiers began to develop a small community, today the village of Kinloch Rannoch. In 1788 the soldiers built an inn at the entrance of this village. This eventually became the Dunalastair Hotel. =General Sir John Macdonald= By the 1860s the Dunalastair Estate belonged to General Sir John Macdonald, who began to develop the surrounding areas. This included the building, in 1862, of a mansion known as Dunalastair House, as well as the episcopal church in Kinloch Rannoch Square. At this time General Macdonald took ownership of the inn which had been built in 1788, and named it the Macdonald Arms Hotel. =20th Century= By the end of the Victorian era, the Macdonald Arms Hotel was firmly established in the area, and was bought by new owners in the early 1900s, when it became known simply as Dunalastair Hotel, Loch Rannoch. =Closure and Takeover= By the turn of the century, the Dunalastair Hotel had already undergone several changes of ownership, and in 2012, was closed altogether.

He made his debut in round 1 of the 2017 season and became an AFL premiership player that same year. In 2019 he won a VFL premiership while playing for Richmond's reserves side.

In time his VFL performances improved including Butler becoming the team's top tackler in the season's closing months. He was named as an emergency for round 23's season ending match against Sydney but ultimately went unselected. Butler's strong from in the back half of the year saw him earn a one-year contract extension for 2017. Following a strong pre- season, Butler made his AFL debut in round 1, 2017 against in the season opener at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He finished the game with 19 disposals and two goals and was named among Richmond's best by journalists at Fairfax and AFL Media. He was again named in the club's best in round 3, this time kicking two goals to go with 17 disposals. Butler's early performances, along with forward-line companions Jason Castagna and Daniel Rioli, played a key role in Richmond's five game unbeaten start to the season. After five rounds the small-forward trio had combined for 23 goals (Butler with seven) and 44 tackles (16 for Butler). After eight consecutive games played, Butler was ruled out from the club's round 9 clash with with a groin injury. He returned to football in round 11, kicking two goals in his side's victory over .

Butler played his first football of the year when he represented the club in a series of AFLX exhibition matches in Sydney in February 2018. He followed that up with selection in each of the club's two official pre-season matches and was trailed for parts of those matches in a wing role. Butler was returned to his familiar forward-line role in round 1 of the home and away season however, where he played a starring role that included three goals, seven tackles and nine score involvements.

He was given another AFL opportunity in round 20, but it was to be for only one match, dropped again after just eight disposals. Butler remained the club's minor premiership winning VFL side into their finals series, contributing a match-high four goals in a come-from-behind qualifying final victory over the reserves. In the week that followed, Butler toured 's facilities ahead of his coming off-season contractual decision, before contributing in a VFL preliminary final as Richmond's reserves won through to that league's grand final. One week later, Butler was named as an emergency before the club's AFL preliminary final but went unselected in the final side and instead lined up in the VFL grand final. He was one of his side's best players in the early stages of the match, collecting 17 disposals though ultimately going goalless in the premiership winning-victory over . Though the club's AFL side would also win through to and be victorious in a grand final the following week, Butler remained unselected at the level. Butler finished 2019 having played seven matches at AFL level but was Richmond's equal-leading goalkicker in the reserves, with 21 goals across 15 games including that years' VFL premiership. Butler's playing future remained uncertain following the end of the season and after a five- year tenure at Richmond that had included 45 AFL matches and premierships at both AFL and VFL levels.

Thomas. reclassified as MSC-209 on 7 February 1955; and commissioned 3 February 1956, Lieutenant Roy M. Malone in command.  West Coast service  During trials and training at Long Beach, California, Woodpecker joined the Mine Force, US Pacific Fleet, and prepared, by a trip to San Diego for underway training and two short yard periods in May and August, at Wilmington Boat Works, Wilmington, California, for duty in the Far East.  Western Pacific service  On 1 October 1956, Woodpecker sailed for Japan via Pearl Harbor and Midway Island. Upon completion of voyage repairs in Yokosuka, Japan, she moved to Sasebo, Japan, her new home port, arriving there in early November 1956. The minesweeper spent the year 1957, conducting various exercises in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Saipan, and Dingalan Bay, Philippines. The year 1958, began with Woodpecker conducting minesweeping exercises with the Republic of Korea Navy at Koji Do, Korea. During the year, the ship conducted two good-will tours in Japan: the first from 23 to 27 January; and the second from 28 May to 15 June. The latter encompassed eight Japanese cities. Woodpecker took part in combined minesweeping operations with the Republic of Korea and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. Due to tension between communist China on the mainland and Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan, Woodpecker served in the Formosa Strait area from September to November. Upon her return to Sasebo on 8 November, she underwent availability and interim dry docking throughout November. She finished out the year 1958, by searching for and locating a downed US Air Force plane off Fukuoka, Japan. Woodpecker spent the early part of 1959, conducting exercises at Taiwan and at Subic Bay and Manila in the Philippines. On 22 March, the ship departed Sasebo for a brief trip to Yosu Hae, Korea. Woodpecker sailed for Okinawa on 8 April, and remained at Buckner Bay through 27 April. She then returned to Sasebo and prepared for a voyage to Korea. Woodpecker arrived at Pusan, Korea, on 1 June, and operated between Pusan and Pohang for nine days before returning to Maizuru, Japan. Woodpecker spent the period from 9 June through 30 September, visiting Maizuru, Sasebo, and Yokosuka, Japan. The ship arrived at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 30 September, and operated between that port and Sasebo through 26 October. Woodpecker then spent the remainder of 1959, visiting Hong Kong and in port at Sasebo. The new year, 1960, found Woodpecker at Sasebo. On 25 January, she began searching for a downed aircraft in waters near Iwakuni and Imabari, Japan. The search continued into February, and ended on 4 February, when the ship returned to Sasebo and remained there until 28 March, when she sailed for Okinawa. Departing Buckner Bay on 13 April, Woodpecker returned to Sasebo to join in fleet exercises before going into dry dock on 21 April, and was under repairs until 31 May. Woodpecker arrived at Pusan, Korea, on 9 June 1960, for \\"Phiblex\\" operations off Pohang, South Korea, and spent the remainder of June, conducting exercises at Yongil Mon and San Chon Po, Korea, and Miko Wan, Japan. On 1 July, the minesweeper got underway for Sasebo where she remained until 18 July, when she departed for Minamata, Japan. Woodpecker spent four days at Minamata and five days at Yokosuka before returning to Sasebo on 1 August. She remained at her home port until 9 September, when she began a two- day round-trip voyage to Pohang, Korea. Woodpecker departed Sasebo on 13 October, bound for Hong Kong. On 29 October, she set course for Okinawa and remained at Buckner Bay until 6 November, when she sailed for her home port. During December, Woodpecker visited Kure and Hiroshima, Japan, before returning to Sasebo on 11 December, for the remainder of 1960. The ship spent the first part of 1961, undergoing various inspections, overhaul, and refresher training at Yokosuka.

This was followed by a rest and rehabilitation run to Hong Kong and a period in dry dock ending on 30 November. Woodpecker finished the year 1961, in the area of Fukuoka Wan and Iwakuni, Japan, conducting two plane hunts, with one success. Woodpecker spent 1962, in much the same manner as the previous year. During January, she transported an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team to Ikishima, Japan. A period of exercises and inspections followed, along with a \\"People-to-People\\" visit to Tokuyama and Shimonoseki, Japan, in July. From October through December, Woodpecker underwent an overhaul at Sasebo followed by mine countermeasures refresher training. An exciting episode in Woodpeckers career occurred on 24 February 1962, in Japan's Inland Sea. A fire fighting team from the ship joined one from in fighting and extinguishing a raging fire in the engine room of Daiyu Maru. From 2 through 25 January 1963, Woodpecker conducted refresher training at Yokosuka, Japan. She closed the month with a \\"People-to-People\\" visit to Kobe, Japan. The ship spent February and March, participating in combined operations \\"Minex\\" with the navies of Korea and Japan. After several inspections and port visits, Woodpecker entered dry dock in mid-September, at Sasebo. On 1 November, the ship took part in Operation \\"Yellow Bird\\" in Lingayen Gulf, off Luzon in the Philippines. Following a rest and recreation at Hong Kong, Woodpecker joined in Operation \\"Big Dipper\\" in Taiwanese waters which kept her busy through the end of the year. Woodpecker began 1964, by taking part in Operation \\"Polar Bear\\" at Chinhae, Korea, and then participated in Exercise \\"Back Pack\\" at Taiwan from 28 February to 8 March. She devoted the remainder of the year to several inspections, upkeep, and overhaul at Subic Bay, Philippines, and at Sasebo, Japan. Overhaul and refresher training filled the months of January and February 1965, for the minesweeper. After making port visits at Manila, Philippines, and Bangkok, Thailand, the ship conducted Operation \\"Jungle Drum,\\" a joint United States- Thai operation which lasted from 14 to 30 March, in the Gulf of Siam. =Vietnam War service= After a brief upkeep period at Subic Bay, Woodpecker was ordered to South Vietnam when the Navy began coastal surveillance operations to combat communist infiltration from the north. This first deployment to \\"Operation Market Time\\" patrols was conducted during September and October 1965, and for the periods from March through April and from July through August in 1966. During these operations, Woodpecker functioned as a patrol vessel: monitoring coastal traffic, boarding suspicious junks, and participating in naval gunfire support missions. About this time, Woodpecker underwent a series of modifications which increased her capabilities and fitted her to carry out challenging operations in Southeast Asia. A series of ship alterations in 1965 and 1966 modernized the ship's communications facilities. In October 1966, she became the first coastal minesweeper in the Western Pacific (WestPac) to operate an on-line cryptographic facility. Woodpecker returned to her \\"Market Time\\" patrol off the coast of South Vietnam for April and May 1967, then again in December of that year. The new year commenced with Woodpecker still on \\"Market Time\\" duty off South Vietnam. She completed that assignment on 12 January 1968, and proceeded via Subic Bay to Sasebo where she underwent availability. On 26 March 1968, Woodpecker got underway for Okinawa and a month of exercises. The ship sailed on 27 April for Exercise \\"Tarawa\\", held at Manila with minesweepers from the Philippines, Australia and Great Britain. The exercise ended on 24 May 1968; a month later, she took part in \\"Reftrex 3-68\\" and underwent her annual operational readiness inspection. \\"Market Time\\" patrol duty in Vietnam occupied Woodpecker until 7 September, when she moved to Subic Bay for repairs which lasted through 27 October, then spent the remainder of 1968 at Sasebo. The year 1969 began with a two-week fleet service mine test at Buckner Bay. After an upkeep period in Sasebo, Woodpecker returned to sea for a joint exercise with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. On 3 March 1969, the ship commenced her regularly scheduled overhaul. Sea trials, refresher training, and two inspections followed. Woodpecker sailed for Vietnam on 13 July and resumed \\"Market Time\\" patrols. Her duties included search and rescue missions, illumination firing, plus harassment and interdiction fire. The ship returned to Sasebo on 1 October. Mine countermeasures refresher training at Buckner Bay from 10 to 22 October was followed by a brief stay at Sasebo. From 3 to 13 November, Woodpecker joined in a mine countermeasure exercise with the Korean and British navies. Then, a dependents' cruise and a port visit to Kagoshima, Japan, ensued. The remainder of the year was spent in leave and upkeep status at Sasebo, Japan. For the first three months of 1970, Woodpecker conducted operations in Subic Bay, Philippines; Buckner Bay, Okinawa (Japan); and Vietnam. She returned to Sasebo on 22 April, and remained there through 29 June, except for a period of refresher training at Yokosuka. On 7 July, Woodpecker left Sasebo and proceeded to Kaohsiung for a \\"Minex\\" exercise with elements of the Taiwanese Navy. This was followed early in August by exercises with units of the Japanese fleet at Mutsuwan, Japan. The ship returned to Sasebo on 21 August, and made preparations for her return to the United States. Woodpecker returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 October and reached Long Beach, California on 11 November. After a short upkeep period, she departed for Seattle, Washington, and inactivation. On 15 December 1970, Woodpecker was decommissioned and converted to a Naval Reserve training vessel. She was stricken from the Navy list on 1 July 1975, and sold to the Republic of Fiji.

The outer walls were rendered in Roman cement during the Victorian period with scribed lines intended to imitate ashlar. The chancel is 31 ft. 3 in. by 12 ft. 7 in., the nave 48 ft. 3 in. by 15 ft. 9 in., its west end is cut off at 7 ft. 7 in. from the west by an arch carrying the east wall of a small west tower, and a south aisle with porch.Church of St Vincent, Newnham - British History Online The nave has three bays, and some of the nave walling in the church is possibly 12th-century, while the chancel was rebuilt or lengthened in the early 13th-century. The South aisle and West tower date to about 1340 or earlier. From 1420 to 1440 repairs and additions to the church were made by John of Wheathampstead, Abbot of St Albans, probably including the octagonal baptismal font, the East window, the clerestory windows, the stair turret and the South porch. There are fragments of 15th- century glass in the West window of the South aisle and in the South clerestory. The church was renovated in 1881. Because clunch is so soft its use in the construction of the church has encouraged graffiti, in particular around the main entrance and in the south porch; however, due to weathering some of these have now faded. Especially noteworthy are the votive crosses inscribed by Mediaeval pilgrims and other travellers who visited the church on their journeys, possibly to the Abbey at St Albans, and which are still visible on the outside of the door arch. Clearer examples of a fish and a windmill can be seen around the doorway to the belfry turret. In the chancel can be found two monumental brasses, one to Joan Dowman of 1607, having a large figure with the figures of one son and seven daughters below, each with a name attached. The other slab is of the early 16th-century and has the figures of a man and his two wives, beneath the second wife being one son and three daughters, while the brasses of the first wife's children have been lost.The Parish of Newnham - A History of the County of Hertford: Volume 2. Originally published by Victoria County History, London, (1908) - pgs 355-357 On the walls and floor are memorials dating from the 17th and 18th-centuries. An embroidery of St Vincent originally kept in his home by the solicitor and historian Reginald Hine (who was born in Newnham Hall) is now on display in his memory in St Vincent's church. The church has only one bell in the tower, though there are \\"pits\\" for four. This single bell originally belonged to a group of three, the other two being in nearby churches at Clothall and Norton, and all are believed to have been cast by the same person, probably a local craftsman at the end of the 16th century. Local tradition suggests that the two bells from St Vincent's were sold to these churches many years ago. The Newnham Murals It was the custom in the Middle Ages to decorate the interior of churches with Bible Stories, single figures of Saints, Moralities and decorative designs. During the English Reformation in the 16th-century such pictorial representations gave offence and were either destroyed or whitewashed over, often with Biblical texts painted over them. Remains of wall paintings were discovered on the North wall in 1963; these are believed to be 14th and 15th-century in date (some may be as early as the 13th-century). There is evidence that this wall was decorated along its whole length. Directly opposite the entrance is the best preserved of the murals which shows the lower half of St Christopher including his feet, the bottom of his staff, some cliffs and fish darting in a stream. On the right (East) side the banks of the stream can be seen, and on the left is the faint image of the hermit standing in his cell with his lantern to guide the Saint. This painting is late 15th-century in date and the muted colours include red, yellow, grey and black, with a hint of vermilion. Other features include what appears to be a mermaid and part of a pillar, and these may belong to an earlier 14th-century mural. The upper half of the Saint carrying the infant Christ was accidentally destroyed during the reconstruction of the nave roof in 1881. To its right is a fragment showing a wheel design with figures of mysterious creatures, while to the East of the eastern nave window a hooded human figure can be seen on the window edge close to the pulpit. This latter section may have been part of a Doom Painting, portraying the Last Judgement. A consecration cross of unusual design is visible on the South East face of the stair turret.St Vincent, Newnham, Nr Baldock - the Church of England website Gallery File:West View Newnham Church.jpgLooking West in Newnham Church File:South Aisle Newnham Church.jpgView of the South Aisle File:Pulpit Newnham Church.jpgThe pulpit File:St Christopher Newnham Mural.jpgFragment of a Mural of Saint Christopher File:Round Mural Newnham Church 2017.jpgThe Wheel Mural File:Newnham Mural Hooded Figure.jpgFragment of a Doom Painting of the Last Judgement File:Joan Dowman Brass 1607 Newnham.jpgMonumental brass of Joan Dowman (1607) File:Monumental brass Newnham Church.jpgBrass of a man and his two wives File:Reginald Hine Memorial Newnham Church.jpgEmbroidery dedicated to historian Reginald Hine References External links *Church of St Vincent, Newnham - Hertfordshire Churches in Photographs Newnham Newnham, Church of St Vincent Newnham, Church of St Vincent Newnham Churches in Hertfordshire ","title":"Church of St Vincent, Newnham"},{"id":"53573902","text":"The Francis Metallic Surfboat is a boat, currently housed at 130 West Center Street in Douglas, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. It is one of two known surviving examples of its kind, one of the first type of coastal rescue craft used. History The Francis Metallic Surfboat was designed by Joseph Francis, an inventor who specialized in inventing and constructing maritime lifesaving equipment. Francis constructed 137 of these vessels from about 1849 to 1857, of which 48 were used on the Great Lakes. This particular boat dates from approximately 1854, and was in use from 1854 until at least 1863. It was originally stationed near the mouth of the Kalamazoo River. The vessel gradually deteriorated until the 1930s, after which its remains were put into storage. In about 2006, volunteers from the Saugatuck-Douglas Historical Society (SDHS) restored the boat. In 2011, the Society constructed a dedicated building in Douglas to display the vessel. The boat remains on display in the building in Douglas. Description The Francis Metallic Surfboat is a 26-foot vessel with a six-foot beam. The hull is made of iron. The boat was built using an innovative metal fabricating technique invented by Joseph Francis. The boat is an example of a distinctly American type of rescue craft known as the \\"pulling\\" surfboat, which is designed to be pulled through the water by oars, rather than propelled by a sail or motor.

He was President of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division from 1985‚Äì1986, and a President of the Hegel Society of America. Quentin Lauer was also a scholar of Edmund Husserl. He was a professor of philosophy at Fordham University from 1954 to 1990. Important works by Lauer which helped disseminate the ideas of Hegel and Husserl in the United States include: A Reading of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1977), The Triumph of Subjectivity (1958) and Edmund Husserl: Phenomenology and the Crisis of Philosophy (1965).Lauer, Quentin. The Triumph of Subjectivity:An Introduction to Transcendental Phenomenology. New York: Fordham University Press, 1958. Life and Academic Career Quentin Lauer was born in Brooklyn on April 1, 1917. At the age of 18, Lauer joined the Jesuit novitiate, entering the seminary of the Society of Jesus in Poughkeepsie, New York. This began his lifelong journey with the Society of Jesus, the order through which, after attaining his and AB and MA (1943) from St. Louis University, he would be ordained in 1948. During his time at St. Louis, Lauer became exposed to the ongoing debates within Thomism centering around interpretation of the metaphysics of St. Thomas Aquinas. The new interpretation of St. Thomas's metaphysics presented by Etienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain, who emphasized the \\"existential\\" aspect of Thomistic metaphysics and the distinctly philosophical significance of his thought, had become prevalent at St. Louis, challenging earlier, more strictly theological forms of Thomism. Lauer had sympathies with this new presentation of St. Thomas's thought, though he would distance himself from St. Thomas when he began studying at the Sorbonne, where he would attain a doctorate and the prestigious Docteur √®s lettres. Lauer became known in Paris as the \\"motorcycle philosopher,\\" soaring through the streets of Paris on a motorcycle over the four years that he wrote his dissertation, La gen√®se de l'intentionnalit√© dans la philosophie de Husserl. After finishing his doctorate, Lauer would return to the United States, taking a position at Fordham University, where he would continue to work and live for virtually the rest of his life. Quentin Lauer would help introduce phenomenology in United States, which was rather unstudied and new to the U.S. Aron Gurwitsch wrote that Lauer had \\"rendered a valuable service to both the cause of phenomenology and American philosophy\\" by presenting \\"the scientific spirt,in a radical sense, which was alive in Husserl\\".Gurwitsch, Aron. \\"Foreword\\". Lauer, Quentin. The Triumph of Subjectivity: An Introduction to Transcendental Phenomenology. New York: Fordham University Press, 1958.(page viii) From the mid fifties to sixties, Lauer would publish several books and articles on Husserl.However, Lauer would eventually become disillusioned with this philosophical system, seeing it as failing to create a dialogue between ideas and history, ethics and religion. Lauer became briefly engaged in dialogue with Marxism, co-publishing with French Marxist Roger Garaudy in 1968 A Christian-Communist Dialogue (published in France as Marxistes et chr√©tiens face √† face; Peuvent-ils construire ensemble l'avenir?). This work was noted for successfully presenting a frank and genuine dialogue between Christians and Marxists. After this rather brief engagement with French Marxism, Lauer began his study of the thought of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, for which he devoted the rest of his career. He wrote four books and dozens of papers on Hegel, including Hegel's Idea of Philosophy(1976), Studies in Hegelian Dialectic(1977), and Hegel's Concept of God(1982). Lauer also initiated and became General Editor in the SUNY series of Hegelian studies, which published works by international Hegel scholars, including William Desmond and H. S. Harris. As General Editor of the SUNY series, Lauer helped encourage other publishing houses in America to publish works on Hegel at a time when many were not willing to. Lauer was elected President of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division in 1985. Lauer was elected as a \\"pluralist\\" candidate and partially as response to hegemony of analytic philosophy in America. At this time some members of the APA began to formerly protest the monolithic hold that analytic philosophers had in the APA and in most American philosophy departments. Lauer's presidential address was titled, \\"Why Be Good?\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/30/archives/philosophical-groups- dominant-view-is-criticized-others-crowded-out.html After a couple years of illness, Quentin Lauer died on March 9, 1997.

He also said that his party did not indulge in the politics of votebank. = Triple Talaq = Triple Talaq is a controversial method of unilateral divorce amongst Muslims where the husband divorces his wife by announcing the word \\"Talaq\\" thrice.

He is known for the far-reaching \\"Mahalwari\\" tax reform. Early life He was the son of Robert and Lucy Bird of Taplow, Buckinghamshire; his younger brother Edward was the father of Isabella Bird. The marriage was of cousins, with the same surname, and there were four sons and six daughters. Bird entered the East India College, after preparation by a tutor, and with the support of George Smith; and passed out ninth in its first leaving class, the class of 1808. He arrived in India on 9 November 1808. There was more time in college, at Fort William, after which he took the judicial route, one of the two main specialisations for the civil servants of the East India Company. He began service as an assistant to the registrar of the Sadr Diwani Adalat in Calcutta. The first mofussil (provincial) experience for Bird was a tour in 1813 with William Wilberforce Bird, a first cousin. It took him to the Benares area of North India. He was a magistrate and judge at Ghazipur from 1816 to 1826, then becoming judge at Gorakhpur, remaining in what is now northern Uttar Pradesh. His first wife died in 1821, in the first cholera pandemic, leaving him with children to bring up, and his sister Mary came out from England to support him. He married again in 1824. Revenue officer In 1829 Bird was transferred to the appointment of commissioner of revenue and circuit for the Gorakhpur division. As a judicial officer, Bird had acquired insight into land ownership in India, and the impact on it of the legal framework. On his appointment as a revenue commissioner, he made a reputation, and when it was decided in 1833 to revise the settlement of the land revenue of the North- Western Provinces, Lord William Bentinck, the governor-general, chose Bird. Retaining his seat as a member of board of revenue recently constituted at Allahabad, he took sole charge of the settlement operations, which he brought to completion by the end of 1841. The conclusions were stated in a major report. Bird retired from the service in 1842, and was succeeded on the board of revenue by James Thomason. Later life Bird spent the remainder of his life in England, where he was a member of the committee of the Church Missionary Society. A few months before his death, which occurred at Torquay on 22 August 1853, he gave evidence before the committee of the House of Commons on the renewal of the East India Company's charter. Report Bird's work on land revenue was recorded in a report which he laid before government early in 1842. The settlement was the most complete that had yet been made in British India. It covered an area of , and a population of 23 million. In the report he explained that the work had not been confined to an accurate assessment of what could be taxed. It also included: > \\"the decision and demarcation of boundaries, the defining and recording the > separate possession, rights, privileges, and liabilities of the members of > those communities who hold their land in severalty; the framing a record of > the several interests of those who hold their land in common; the providing > a system of self-government for the communities; the rules framed with their > own consent according to the principles of the constitution of the different > tenures; the preparation of the record of the fields and of the rights of > cultivators possessing rights; and the reform of the village accounts and > completion of a plan of record by their own established accountants, and > according to their own method, by reference to which the above points of > possession and right might, under the various changes to which property is > subject, continue to be ascertained.\\" A corresponding system of accounts for the offices of the tehsildars, and for those of the collectors of districts, was also framed. The revenue settlement for the North-West Provinces was praised by John Stuart Mill. Evangelical background Bird, an evangelical Christian, supported the Church Missionary Society's work while still in India. By family background he was linked to the Wilberforces: his mother Lucy Wilberforce Bird was the sister of William Wilberforce Bird the Member of Parliament for ; William Wilberforce was a close relation, Lucy being the daughter of his aunt Judith. He was joined in India in 1823 by his sister Mary Bird (1789‚Äì1834), who worked as a missionary. The second sister, Lucy, married in 1828 the Rev. Marmaduke Thompson, who had been in India from 1806 to 1819 as a chaplain nominated by Charles Simeon, returning as a widower to the United Kingdom. William Bell Mackenzie wrote a preface to an edition in 1855 of writings on the Pentateuch, Bible Teaching, by three of Bird's sisters. Legacy Penner identifies the \\"Bird-Thomason school\\" of officials that followed the approach laid down by Bird. It included, but was not limited to, George Campbell (1824‚Äì1892), John Russell Colvin, Frederick Currie, Robert Needham Cust, George Frederick Edmondstone, Henry Miers Elliot, John Laird Mair Lawrence, Charles Grenville Mansel, Robert Montgomery, William Muir, Edward Anderdon Reade, Richard Temple, and Edward Parry Thornton. Of those, Colvin, Cust, Lawrence, Mansel, Montgomery, Muir, Reade, Temple and Thornton are identified as evangelicals. Family Bird married: #In 1810, Jane Grant Brown, daughter of the Rev. David Brown, who died in Gorakhpur on 6 September 1821; #In 1824 in Cape Town, Jane Bird, a first cousin as daughter of William Wilberforce Bird, comptroller of customs there, who died in Taplow in 1845; #In 1848, Henrietta Maria Jane Grenfell of Taplow. She was the fifth daughter of Pascoe Grenfell, and the wives of Charles Kingsley and James Froude were her sisters. The eldest son of the first marriage was Robert Wilberforce Bird. Another son, Charles Robinson Bird, was rector of Castle Eden and father of Mary Bird,s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Bird, Charles Robinson and of Harriet Amelia Scott Bird (1864‚Äì1934) who trained at the Edinburgh Medical College for Women, worked at Leith Hospital, married Robert William MacKenna and was mother of Robert Merttins Bird MacKenna, both physicians.

Its original implementation is described in Nissen's 2003 report Implementation of a Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN).Nissed, Steffen. Implementation of a Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (FANN). Department of Computer Science University of Copenhagen (DIKU), 2003 This report was submitted to the computer science department at the University of Copenhagen (DIKU). In his original report Nissen describes that one of his primary motivations in writing FANN was developing a neural network library that was friendly to both, fixed point, and floating point arithmetic. Nissen wanted to develop an autonomous agent that can learn from experience. His goal was to use this autonomous agent to create a virtual player in Quake III Arena that can learn from game play. Since its original 1.0.0 version release, the library's functionality has been expanded by the creator and its many contributors to include more practical constructors, different activation functions, simpler access to parameters and bindings to multiple programming languages. It has been downloaded 450,000 times since its move to Source Forge in 2003 and 29,000 times in 2016 alone. The source code is now hosted on GitHub. The project was inactive from Nov 2015 to May 2018; in the issue section some users mentioned that the author was no longer contactable. Starting from 2018, development has become active again with contribution from several collaborators.https://github.com/libfann/fann/issues/95  Research  The original FANN report written by Steffen Nissen has been cited 337 times per google scholar.

He was a member of the Unity party from 2000 to 2003 and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation from 2011 to 2016. Voronenkov was born in Gorky, Russian SFSR. He studied at the Suvorov Military School before joining the Soviet Army. In 1999, he left the military to begin a career in politics. In 2001, he became an advisor to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, then being selected as the Deputy Mayor of Naryan-Mar and Deputy Governor of Nenets Autonomous District. Voronenkov then joined the Communist Party and was elected to the State Duma in 2011. In the 2016 legislative election he lost his seat to United Russia candidate Vladimir Panov. The following month, Voronenkov renounced his Russian citizenship and emigrated to Ukraine with his wife, Maria Maksakova Jr. There he became a vocal critic of Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Russian foreign policy. Although as a member of the State Duma, he had voted for Russia's annexation of Crimea, while in Ukraine he argued that the annexation had been illegal. In early 2017, the Investigative Committee of Russia opened a case to look into Voronenkov's suspected corruption, and an investigation by the anti-corruption blogger and Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny found that Voronenkov possessed significantly more assets than his officially-declared income would allow. Voronenkov was shot dead in Kiev by a Ukrainian national, Pavel Parshov. Ukrainian prosecutors believe that it had been a contract killing (arranged by an FSB officer) while the country's then-president, Petro Poroshenko, alleged that it had been orchestrated by the Russian government. Personal life and family Voronenkov was born in Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Russian SFSR, but had a Ukrainian grandmother and (according to his widow) spent his childhood in Ukraine's Kherson Oblast. Voronenkov married former fellow Russian MP and opera singer Maria Maksakova Jr. in March 2015. The couple met while working on a bill regulating the export of cultural artifacts. Each of them had two children from previous relationships. Their son was born in April 2016. Voronenkov's first two children are his daughter Xenia (b. 2000) and his son Nikolay from his first marriage with Yulia. Education As the son of a serviceman, Voronenkov won a place in the Leningrad Suvorov Military School, from which he graduated in 1988 and then immediately joined the Soviet Army. In 1995 he completed a diploma level officers course at the Military University of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, prior to his transfer to the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. In 1996 he did another course at the Faculty of Law of Ryazan State University. In 1999, at the Moscow Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Russian Federation he successfully defended his thesis for the Degree of Candidate for Legal Sciences, titled 'Legal Nihilism and Legal Idealism (Theoretical and Legal Research)', Doctor of Law. In 2009 he defended his thesis on 'Theoretical and normative basis of judicial control in the mechanism of separation of powers', at the Russian Legal Academy of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Career Voronenkov eventually came to hold the rank of colonel in the Russian army. He had worked in military and federal law enforcement since 1995, joining the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation, initially as an investigator. He had reached the position of deputy prosecutor by the time he left the military in 1999 in order to enter politics. In 2000 Voronenkov became an employee for the State Duma faction of the Unity party. In 2001 he became an advisor of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation before becoming the Deputy Mayor of Naryan-Mar and Deputy Governor of Nenets Autonomous District. Voronenkov then worked for the Federal Drug Control Service of Russia from 2004 until 2007. He then pursued an academic career as an associate professor; his last post before being elected an MP was (from February 2010) at the St. Petersburg Institute of International Trade, Economics and Law. =Political career= Voronenkov was elected as a deputy for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, in 2011. Voronenkov lost his bid for reelection in September 2016, taking third place (13.99%) in constituency No.129, located in his native Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, well behind the winner, United Russia candidate Vladimir Panov (42.39%). He stepped down from the State Duma in October. Later that month, Voronenkov announced that he had given up his Russian citizenship and left for Ukraine, where he was naturalized as a Ukrainian citizen in December. Voronenkov said that he had no intention of entering Ukrainian politics. He was expelled from the Communist Party in 2016. After he moved to Ukraine, he became known as a sharp critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Russian policy towards Ukraine. Before stepping down as an MP in Russia, he had however taken part in the parliamentary vote to annex Crimea from Ukraine, for which he was criticised in Ukraine. Although his vote was registered, he stated that he was not present in parliament on that day. In 2014 he had also voiced support for the breakaway regions of Novorossiya in the east of Ukraine, which added to the criticism of him in Ukraine. In 2017 he was however an outspoken critic of Russian intervention in Ukraine and elsewhere, e.g. in Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in February 2017, Voronenkov compared Russia under Vladimir Putin to Nazi Germany and called the Russian annexation of Crimea both illegal and a mistake. He described the atmosphere in Russia as characterised by a \\"pseudo-patriotic frenzy\\" and \\"total fear\\". At the time of his death, he had been due to testify against former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. According to Voronenkov, he was persecuted in Russia by the Federal Security Service whom he accused of being involved in drug trafficking. In October 2016 the Russian Prosecutor-General's Office refused to launch a probe against Voronenkov recommended by the Investigative Committee of Russia. Nevertheless, Voronenkov was accused later of being involved in an illegal property seizure (worth 127 million rubles) in Moscow. Russian investigators were preparing a criminal case against Voronenkov, but were waiting for his parliamentary immunity to run out in December 2016. In March 2017 a court in Moscow had sanctioned Voronenkov's arrest in absentia. Voronenkov himself dismissed the Russian accusations as politically motivated and stated that the Federal Security Service had offered him to write off the accusations against him if he would pay them US$3 million. Voronenkov has been accused by Alexey Navalny and the Anti-Corruption Foundation of using ill- gotten wealth to buy extensive property and automotive holdings worth hundreds of millions of rubles. Voronenkov had multiple properties including a luxury villa worth 300 million rubles, which his annual parliamentary salary of 3 million rubles (his highest ever reported income), given that he has only ever worked in the Russian government, could scarcely have afforded him. Death Voronenkov was shot dead in Kiev as he left the Premier Palace hotel on March 23, 2017. Ukraine's General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko stated that Voronenkov was shot at least three times, including in the head, and died instantly. He was on his way to meet Ilya Ponomarev, another former Russian MP living in exile in Ukraine (the only MP to vote against the annexation of Crimea). His assailant was wounded by Voronenkov's bodyguard (who was provided by the Ukrainian Security Service) and taken to a hospital, where he later died from his wounds, according to the authorities. The gunman carried a Ukrainian passport and had been sought by the police on fraud and money laundering charges, according to the General Prosecutor of Ukraine. Anton Herashchenko, an official with Ukraine's Interior Ministry and a Ukrainian lawmaker said that the name of the gunman was Pavel Parshov, a Ukrainian citizen and veteran of Ukraine's volunteer paramilitary unit.\\" He also said that Parshov was planted by Russian services as an undercover agent into the National Guard of Ukraine. A police spokesman said the murder was likely a contract killing. Voronenkov's bodyguard was also wounded during the incident. The president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko reacted to the murder by calling it an act of Russian \\"state terrorism\\". Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov denied being involved and called the claims \\"absurd\\". Several other officials also dismissed involvement. Russian MP and former Director of the Russian Federal Security Service Nikolay Kovalyov said to Russian TV that he believed the murder may be linked to a business dispute. Ponomarev reacted to the murder by stating: \\"I have no words. The security guard was able to injure the attacker. The potential theory is obvious. Voronenkov was not a crook, but an investigator who was fatally dangerous to Russian authorities.\\" Lutsenko called the murder a \\"typical show execution of a witness by the Kremlin.\\" A little more than a month before his murder, Voronenkov said that he feared for his own and his family's security, and that he had been \\"poking a sore spot of the Kremlin\\" with his criticism of the Russian president. In a March 2017 interview, he referred to \\"demonization\\" in Russia and stated, \\"The system has lost its mind. They say we are traitors in Russia. And I say, 'Who did we betray?\\" In 2019 The New York Times Magazine reported that Voronenkov's death was likely to have been related to him benefiting on his co-conspirators in a case of corporate raiding. = Investigation = Paverl Parshov's papers issued by UNG. In March, 2017 the Ukrainian National Guard (UNG) identified perpetrator of the crime as Pavlo Parshov (), a 28-year-old far-right Ukrainian nationalist and former servant of the National Guard and who was previously suspected in a money-laundering case. He died in custody in intensive care unit from wounds sustained at the scene. His nom de guerre was the Boxer. The same month Ukrainian MIA placed on its wanted list Parshov's suspected co-conspirator Yaroslav Levenets () who previously served as militant (under the Hunter pseudonym) in the far-right nationalist Right- Sector group and who fought in War in Donbass and had history of arrests for various crimes in the past. In September 2017 Ukrainian prosecutor's office announced that Vladimir Tyurin (a thief in law who was in relationship with Maria Maksakova Jr. before she married Voronenkov) was hired by Oleg Feoktistov (), a Russian FSB officer, to organize assassination of Voronenkro. The latter was said to be at odds with Feoktistov. The investigation did not provide any evidence.

The film was quickly overshadowed by the more lavishly budgeted Frankenstein: The True Story which premiered later that same year. Reception At the time of its release, the film garnered praise. Variety called the film \\"extraordinary entertainment.\\" The Los Angeles Times said it was \\"quite a handsome show, with huge, foreboding sets and a splendid array of special effects.\\" Radu Florescu's In Search of Frankenstein declared it \\"probably the most faithful rendering the screen has yet seen.\\" Modern reviews have been less effusive with CHUD.com saying \\"Ultimately, I can‚Äôt recommend Dan Curtis‚Äô Frankenstein, but it was fun to watch....No, it's not good television and it doesn't make a good movie, but it's faithful to the text and reminds me of an era long gone.\\" Comingsoon.net said of the film \\"As a whole, ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù is an admirable accomplishment but it's also unmistakably a work of its time with its shot on video, stage- bound look lending it the feel of a situation comedy or SNL sketch.\\" See also * List of films featuring Frankenstein's monster References  External links 1973 television films 1973 films American television films American films English- language films Horror television films Films based on horror novels Frankenstein films Science fiction television films 1973 horror films Films set in Germany ","title":"Frankenstein (1973 film)"},{"id":"53574454","text":"Lu Zhenhong (born April 15, 1991) is a Chinese baseball outfielder who plays with the Jiangsu Hopestars in the China Baseball League.

Built in 1756 by one of the first colonial settlers of the area, it is one of the village's oldest buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The David Welch House stands near the easternmost end of the village of Milton, on the north side of the junction of Milton and Potash Roads. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Many of the clapboards and windows in the building are original. The house is eight bays wide, consisting of an original five-bay section and a later three-bay addition to the right, and has a saltbox profile with an integral leanto to the rear. Both the main section and the addition have entrances at their respective centers. That of the main house is elaborate, with sidelight windows, pilasters, transom window, and entablature. A large brick chimney rises at the center behind that entrance. The interior retains many original 18th-century features, including wainscoting on the walls and paneled fireplace surrounds. The house was built in 1756 by John Marsh Jr., one of the early proprietors of Litchfield, for his daughter Irene and son-in-law David Welch. Local lore has it that Irene dubbed the village \\"Milton\\" that arose after the mills that lined the branches of the Shepaug River that flowed nearby. Welch owned and operated several iron foundries in the area, and was a prominent figure in local politics, serving in the state legislature. Both Welch and his son John were active participants in the American Revolutionary War. The three-bay addition was built before the war, from which the Welches ran a store. The house remained in the Welch family until 1860.

His highest rank was sekiwake. He was ranked in the top makuuchi division from 1950 until 1962 and earned ten gold stars for defeating yokozuna. After his retirement from active competition he was an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and worked as a coach at Tatsunami stable until his mandatory retirement in 1988 upon reaching 65 years of age. He then became a sumo TV commentator. Career He was born in 1923 as Noboru Ogata in Abashiri, Hokkaido, the second son of owners of a popular local restaurant. His older brother died in an accident at elementary school, and he became a much shyer personality after that tragedy. An acquaintance had connections to sekiwake Asahigawa, and Ogata was also an admirer of Futabayama. Both were members of the Tatsunami stable, and so in January 1939 Ogata applied to join. He was turned down due to a lack of weight, with the coach who conducted the examination suggesting he might be better off as a tokoyama (sumo hairdresser). However, Ogata was determined to become a sumo wrestler, and successfully passed the physical examination a year later. Making his professional debut in January 1940, and managing to avoid being called up for war service, he rose slowly up the ranks. He reached the second highest juryo division in October 1948 and the top makuuchi division in September 1950. He made his debut in the sanyaku ranks at komusubi in September 1954. He was runner-up in the March 1957 tournament with a 12‚Äì3 record. His highest rank was sekiwake, which he reached in November 1957 at the age of 35. He earned ten special prizes for achievements in tournaments and ten kinboshi, or gold stars, for defeating yokozuna. His kinboshi were earned against six different yokozuna: Azumafuji, Yoshibayama (twice), Tochinishiki (twice), Chiyonoyama, Wakanohana and Asashio (three times). He defeated Tochinishiki on the opening day of the September 1958 tournament, a match which became notorious after the referee initially awarded the bout to Tochinishiki and then argued with the judges for ten minutes after they reversed his decision, leading to the referee's suspension for the rest of the tournament. His final win over a yokozuna was in May 1961 at the age of 38 years, three months, making him the oldest post-war wrestler ever to earn a kinboshi. Fighting style He was known as \\"white lightning\\" because of his powerful tachi-ai and the speed and ferocity of his bouts. His most common winning kimarite, or techniques, were yori-kiri (force out), yori-taoshi (force out and down), and uwate-nage (overarm throw). Retirement from sumo He retired in March 1962, after facing demotion to the juryo division. At 39 years and one month he was one of the oldest ever postwar sekitori. He had fought in 77 career tournaments, 52 in the top division, where his winning percentage was .487 (368 wins against 388 losses). He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Takekuma. He worked as a coach at his old stable and was also on the board of Directors of the Sumo Association from 1978 to 1982. When yokozuna Futahaguro had a heated row with his stablemaster, ex-sekiwake Annenyama, in December 1987, storming out of the stable and pushing his stablemaster's wife out of the way, it was Takekuma who tried unsuccessfully to persuade Futahaguro to return and apologize. Futahaguro was forced to retire in disgrace. Takekuma retired from the Sumo Association himself shortly afterwards at the end of January 1988, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. He passed on the Takekuma elder name to former sekiwake Kurohimeyama, who had become his son-in-law. Upon leaving the Sumo Association he became a TV commentator for NHK's sumo coverage. His last appearance was in 2000, and he suffered a stroke in March 2001. He died in 2002 at the age of 78 in a hospital in Tochigi, from cerebral thrombosis.

All have primarily brick facades and are between two and four stories in height. Architectural elements are generally of commercial Italianate or Romanesque style, and all of the buildings have projecting decorative cornices. The ground floor storefronts have generally been modernized, although some original details are still visible. There is only one non-contributing building, a small single-story structure built as infill into one of the two alleys on the block. The left side of the district Winsted's commercial and industrial buildings of the late 19th century once lined both sides of Main Street. The buildings on the south side of the road were swept away during devastating flooding in 1955, and the city decided to widen the road rather rebuild. The city had developed beginning with the arrival of the railroad in 1849, and rapidly grew as an urban industrial center, gaining a measure of independence as an independent borough of Winchester in 1858.

Common game topics belong to categories such as: marketing strategy, product positioning, pricing strategies, consumer behaviour. Marketing games usually focus on the marketing landscape of a certain business industry or a company . A marketing simulation game usually contains a number of scenarios and provides participants with results in response to their decisions. The games can be played either by individuals or teams. The learning environment is usually a collaborative and/or competitive market in which participants represent companies which need to take decisions in an iterative manner, usually on a round-by-round basis.  In education  Faria and Wellington (2004) found that 64.1% of 1,085 faculty members surveyed in American Universities were using games with a focus on marketing. Pedagogical expectations are that students using these simulations will learn more about marketing strategy concepts through the application of marketing knowledge as well as gain marketing application skills. The advance of digital technology in marketing has led to a gap in digital literacy among marketing professionals . Consequently, there is increasing pressure for marketing educators to help their students develop digital marketing skills . Computerized marketing simulation games have been widely used as teaching and learning resources in Marketing Strategy and Management courses ‚Äì and continue to be adopted as a meaningful pedagogical tool. The usage of computerized marketing simulation games is consistent with learners' growing interest in acquiring and developing digital skills. Research has found that students can use both marketing simulation games and real marketing projects with comparable feelings of reality and enhanced perceptions of learning. In Between 2008 and 2017 Google ran the \\"Google Onine Marketing Challenge\\" (GOMC), an online competition aimed at higher education students. The format of the competition allowed student teams to work with SMEs and nonprofit organizations in recognition that many marketing students are employed by one such organization. The goal of participants was to develop a precampaign report followed by online marketing campaigns. According to research, for an effective experiential learning activity instructors should emphasize that students need to plan, execute, and assess their actions, which requires the provision of feedback mechanisms as part of the experience. =Instructional design considerations= There is a need for more empirical research to examine the varying characteristics in existing marketing simulations in light of various course requirements and various student groups. There is emerging instructional research on the learning framework proposed by marketing simulation games which focuses on how game analytics and learning analytics provide students with personalized experiences and how this increases their engagement. Often this research is focused on just one marketing simulation game platform used in a small number of universities coming from the same country or region. Acceptance of computer-based simulation devices in learning can affect learning outcomes. It has been argued that computer-based simulation games, involving the use of technology that users are less familiar with, can place an additional burden on learners and generate frustration and low satisfaction that can negatively affect learning outcomes Valid criticism appears when students are involved in ‚Äògaming‚Äô the simulation algorithm in search of higher returns. In this mode of play, students typically manifest behaviour where they adopt high-risk decisions, often giving little thought on the decision-making process itself, thus reducing learning outcomes.  Other usages of marketing simulations  Additional usage for marketing simulations has been identified: as an aid in decision making and as a means for gaining further insight into a system as well as a guideline for research.

After one year at the torpedo officer and electricians school, Georges Cabanier opted for a career as a submariner in the submarine service (). In 1932, he embarked on board 1500 ton-class submarine L'Ach√©ron, then on submarine Le Saphir. Lieutenant de vaisseau in 1934, he served on submarine Orion, in 1936, on submarine cruiser Surcouf,Surcouf, Robert Surcouf (1773-1827) on which he partook to an endurance cruise in the South Atlantic. In 1938, he served, then was designated as commandant of the mine laying Rubis. Since June 1940, he opted to serve the camp of Free France with the quasi-totality of his crew. His Rubis FNFL pavilion pursued patrols in the Northern seas and conducted several mine laying missions in the larger oceanic area of Norway. First under the orders of capitaine de corvette Cabanier then Lieutenant de vaisseau Rousselot, the Rubis was one of the most effective submarines of the French Navy during the second world war. Capitaine de corvette in January 1941, he joined the Pacific (December 1941), where he was designated chef d'√©tat-major of admiral Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu. Capitaine de frigate (1943), he commanded the auxiliary croiseur Cap des Palmes (1944), which operated in the South Pacific with the 3rd Fleet of the United States Navy. Capitaine de vaisseau in October 1945, he represented France at the United Nations Conference on International Organization of San Francisco (April 1945), and two months later, assumed the command of the French Naval School (June 1945) and in 1947 the school-cruiser Jeanne d'Arc. He served as the Naval attach√© to the U.S. in July 1949, and received his contre-amiral stars in January 1951. In January 1953, the contre-amiral Cabanier was designated as secretary general adjoint of the D√©fense nationale (). In March 1954, he was the head of the naval contingent in Indochina. Upon his return to France in February 1956, he was designated as the chef de l'√âtat-major of the particular naval state secretary (). Vice-amiral in November 1956, he assumed a couple of days later the command of Anti-Submarine Action Group (). In 1957, Admiral Cabanier intervened so that the Rubis (along with corvette Aconit, the only two Compagnon de la Lib√©ration naval warships of the French Navy), would not get disposed of. Accordingly, a sonar target use was assigned which resulted in drowning the boat indefinitely in the Mediterranean Sea. In June 1958, he was assigned as chef d'√âtat-major de la D√©fense nationale () of the cabinet of g√©n√©ral de Gaulle. Vice-admiral of a naval squadron in November 1958, then Admiral on 1 July 1960, he was designated as Chief of Staff of the French Navy CEMM and held tenure in this post until 1 January 1968. From 15 February 1969 until 14 February 1975, he was designated as the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honor (). The Ashes of Admiral Cabanier, Vice- Admiral Rousselot and the last survivor of the crew, were dispersed of on top of L'√âpave of French Submarine Rubis.

The forces of D√°l Riata were led by their king Connad Cerr, whilst the D√°l nAraidi were led by M√°el Ca√≠ch, brother of Congal C√°ech who was the king of the D√°l nAraidi and the over-kingdom of Ulaid. The result of the battle was a decisive defeat of the D√°l Riata. Background The battle arose out of an attempt by Connad Cerr, who had succeeded to the D√°l Riata kingship only three months before, to interfere in an internal dispute amongst the D√°l nAraidi. Connad sought to aid his ally, D√≠ucaill mac Eochaid, who was king of the D√°l nAraidi petty-kingdom of Latharna, against that of the U√≠ Ch√≥elbad of Magh Line, on what may have been a battle over the kingship of D√°l nAraidi. It was a significant battle that resulted in a devastating defeat of the D√°l Riata with the death of Connad Cerr as well as of Rigullon and F√°elbe who were two grand-sons of his predecessor √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in. D√≠ucaill mac Eochaid also fell as well as according to one chronicle Osric son of Aelfric, a Saxon prince, possibly of Bernicia. A contingent of Connad Cerr's forces that came from Kintyre in Scottish D√°l Riata were also decimated. Aftermath In the aftermath of the battle of Fid Eoin, Domnall Brecc, grand-son of √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in, ascended to the kingship of D√°l Riata. Domnall Brecc, possibly in an attempt to secure what was left of D√°l Riata's possessions in Ireland and to prevent further incursions from the U√≠ Ch√≥elbad of D√°l nAraidi, accepted Congal C√°ech's overtures of an alliance. This meant abandoning the previous alliance with the D√°l nAraidi's foes, the Cen√©l Conaill of the over-kingdom of Ailech. This alliance, bolstered by one with the kingdom of Strathclyde, was to be used by Congal C√°ech in an attempt to have himself installed as High King of Ireland. This resulted in the disastrous battle of Magh Rath in 637 in which Congal was slain by High King Domnall mac √Åedo, king of the Cen√©l Conaill and over-king of Ailech. This battle resulted in D√°l Riata losing possession of its Scottish lands. It has been suggested that in 631 when Congal C√°ech annexed the petty- kingdom of Mag nEilni, which lay to the west of D√°l Riata, it may have been as a result of the battle of Fid Eoin.

He was the son of Henri d'Outreman, lord of Rombies and member of the town government of Valenciennes. His brother Pierre was also a member of the Society of Jesus and a religious writer. In 1607, Philippe d'Outreman joined the Jesuit novitiate in Tournai. He was ordained priest in 1616. He resided in several towns in the south of the Low Countries, such as Lille, Maubeuge and Cambrai. Le p√©dagogue chr√©tien Philippe d'Outreman is best known as the author of Le p√©dagogue chr√©tien, a book first published in Saint-Omer in 1622 as Le vrai chr√©tien catholique. The book illustrates Catholic doctrine by providing a large number of exampla. It focusses on the different types of sins, good works, sacraments and the cult of saints. The book was initially written to support catechism teachers, but gradually also reached wider audiences. Le p√©dagogue chr√©tien was issued over a hundred times. The author revised his text several times during his life, leading to new editions in Mons, Saint- Omer and Lille, including an extended Nouveau p√©dagogue chr√©tien (2 volumes, 1645-1646). Until after 1740, many new editions were printed in Paris, Lyon, Rouen and other French-speaking towns.A digital copy of the edition of Rouen of 1634 is available on Gallica. In 1854 another revised edition was printed in Paris. The book was translated into English (Saint-Omer, 1622), Latin (Luxemburg, 1629), Dutch (Antwerp, 1637 en 1646), German (Cologne, 1664) en Bisaya (Manila, 1751).

Its anti-corruption measures are regularly evaluated within their monitoring mechanisms. GRECO notes that despite of carried out anti-corruption policies and measures by the Government of Azerbaijan, corruption is referred as one of problematic areas in Azerbaijan. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 122nd place out of 180 countries.  International anti- corruption indices and reports  According to Transparency International, Azerbaijan demonstrates improvement in international anti-corruption reports; however, its position in these indices is weak comparatively to that of neighbouring countries, such as Georgia and Turkey. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Azerbaijan achieved its best position in that year since its inclusion in the report in 2000. Thus, in 2015, Azerbaijan was ranked 20th out of 168 countries compared to 2001 when it was ranked 87th out of 90 countries. The 2015 CPI results show that even though Azerbaijan is ahead of the Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, it is behind Georgia and Turkey. The World Bank‚Äôs Worldwide Governance Indicators support the above-mentioned comparative statistics between countries and report that Azerbaijan's ability to control corruption has increased to 20 (2015) from 7 (2000). The 2013 Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) report of Transparency International indicates that 9% of respondents in Azerbaijan think that corruption has increased a lot. While 69% consider that the government's efforts are effective in the fight against corruption. Furthermore, 71% of respondents agree that an ordinary person can make a difference in the fight against corruption in Azerbaijan. Citizens participation and the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. It is important to develop programs and actions to change the cultural understanding of corruption and helped citizens to act against abuses. In the 2013 GCB report, health, the judiciary, and police were perceived as the most corrupt sectors by respondents. In comparison to the 2010 GCB report, improvement is noted in the more recent report with increased levels of trust in the civil service, education, and police. Contrary to international perceptions, Azerbaijani respondents perceive political parties as one of the least corrupt sectors alongside the media and religious bodies The 2014 National Integrity Assessment report of the Azerbaijani National Chapter of Transparency International characterized Azerbaijan as having a strong executive branch, and law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies while the report indicates that the judiciary and legislative branches of governance are comparatively weak, with the pillars that perform watchdog functions, including civil society, the media, and political parties, being the weakest links in the national integrity system. According to the Global Integrity Index (GIX) (2011), the anti-corruption legislative framework of Azerbaijan is strong (89 out of 100); however, its implementation is very weak (38 out of 100) considering the powers that have been granted by law. Azerbaijan has improved its anti-corruption legislation to bring it into line with the standards of international conventions. However, it lacks the supporting legislative Acts and institutional measures to apply it in practice, thus creating a disparity between the existing legislation and its application. Azerbaijan is a member of the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) and has passed its first, second and third evaluation rounds. In GRECO's fourth evaluation round report, even though serious anti-corruption efforts have been carried out by the Azerbaijani government to fight against corruption, corruption is still being referred to as one of most problematic areas in the country In addition, the GRECO report notes that the lack of control on ancillary activities and asset disclosure of Members of Parliament weakens the anti-corruption framework: the report recommends that anti-corruption efforts be deepened and institutionalized in the field of asset declaration and conflicts of interest. Azerbaijan has signed the Istanbul Anti-Corruption Action Plan (Istanbul Action Plan, or IAP) which covers Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan and the other ACN countries in 2003. The Implementation of the plan includes regular and systematic peer review of the legal, and institutional framework for fighting corruption in the covered countries by the signing parties. Since then Azerbaijan has actively taken part in the monitoring rounds. The international corruption reports and surveys conclude that Azerbaijan demonstrates steady improvement in anti-corruption rankings, but its progress is relatively slower than that of neighbouring countries. Furthermore, Azerbaijan has advanced with its anti-corruption legislation and strong executive branch; however, the legislature and the judiciary are perceived weak and potentially more exposed to corruption. In March 2017, the authorities of Azerbaijan have authorised publication of the Fourth Round Compliance Report on Azerbaijan by GRECO.  Political context and background timeline of corruption issues  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, the transition period in Azerbaijan was complicated and further prolonged by the inability of the national political elite to ensure the existence of key public institutions during 1991‚Äì1993. In addition, during those years, Azerbaijan was forced to engage in military clashes with Armenia over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, as a result of the invasion by Armenia, Azerbaijan lost 20% of its territory. In the same year, the United Nations Security Council adopted four resolutions (822, 853, 874 and 884) which condemned the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories. The UN Security Council demanded from Armenia the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces. As a result of the war with Armenia, the influx of more than one million refugees and internally displaced people had a devastating impact on both the social and economic situation in Azerbaijan (Badalov and Mehdi, 2004). This tragic event shifted the priority of the country from building public institutions to accommodating internally displaced people (IDPs) and providing them with the necessary living standards. In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused economic paralysis in Azerbaijan. Therefore, the main priorities of the Azerbaijani government were to divert all of its financial and political resources to safeguarding IDPs and to fighting against the invasion by Armenia in the international legal arena.  First indicator of anti-corruption political will  Following a period of state building after 1993, adoption of the new Constitution and with Azerbaijan's increasing economic power, President Heydar Aliyev identified four key reform areas comprising: (i) re- organization of state institutions; (ii) adoption of clear and transparent regulations for civil service recruitment; (iii) creation of various anti- corruption preventive and judicial institutions; and (iv) establishment of an anti-corruption policy. President Aliyev next signed the decree on ‚ÄúStrengthening the fight against corruption in the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù on 8 August 2000, which is considered to be the first indicator of the commitment of political will to the fight against corruption in Azerbaijan. The document clearly indicates that despite reforms having been carried out in the field of fighting against economic crimes, corruption and bribery continued to be widespread in public administration and financial regulatory bodies The document also shows that some public officials were misusing their powers to embezzle state property. Furthermore, it stated that legal violations in the private sector and financial regulatory bodies were the main impediments to the establishment of a safe market economy, entrepreneurship and foreign direct investments (FDIs). This anti-corruption decree shows that the fight against corruption came to the state policy agenda almost one decade after the year of independence, and that the main reason behind this document was to attract foreign investment. Another important aspect of this decree is that it assigned tasks to relevant authorities to prepare the draft law and the State Program on Combating Corruption.  Institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms  = Commission on Combating Corruption = Commission on Combating Corruption is set up according to the article 4.2 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on \\"Fight Against Corruption\\" and functions as a specialized agency on combating corruption since 2005. Commission is composed of 15 members. 5 members of the commission are appointed by the President of the Republic, 5 by the Parliament and the 5 by the Constitutional Court. The statute of it approved by the Law of Azerbaijan Republic dated May 3, 2005 defines the authorities of the commission. The commission's main objectives are: * to take part in formation of state policy in the area of combating corruption * to coordinate the activities of public institutions in this area * to supervise the implementation of the State Program on Combating Corruption * to analyse the state and efficiency of the struggle against corruption * to receive financial declarations envisaged in Section 5.1 of the law ‚ÄúOn Combating Corruption\\" * to collect, analyse and summarize information regarding corruption related law violations * to make proposals to the appropriate public institutions * to cooperate with public and other institutions in the field of combating corruption * to receive complaints and applications from individuals Commission in order to reach its objectives, shall vested with followings: * to study and generalize the state of execution of the anti-corruption legislation and to hear the reports and information provided by the heads of the law enforcement and other state bodies; * to receive from state and local administrative bodies necessary information and materials; * to receive information on the state of the implementation of the State Program on Combating Corruption from the corresponding state bodies and analyses the state of the implemented works; * to prepare recommendations and proposals for increasing the efficiency of the combating corruption and elimination of the shortcomings in the field of combating corruption and take measures for their implementation; * to take measures for organization of public awareness in the area of combating corruption and conduction of public surveys * to cooperate with NGO's, mass- media, private sector representatives', independent experts and in case of necessity to involve them for the execution of certain tasks; * to take part in international cooperation for increasing the efficiency and organization of the struggle against corruption; * to send the materials for examination to the competent authority, shall it contain the constitutive elements of the corruption related offences, * to make proposals for the improvement of the anti-corruption legislation; The Commission shall have other authorities provided by the legislation. The Commission on Combating Corruption (CCC) is the main organization and government body which is responsible for policies and prevention measures to fight against corruption. CCC is also responsible for making progress and action plans according to the requirements of the international organizations Azerbaijan has joined with the purpose of eliminating corruption. Azerbaijan has also adopted National Action Plan for 2016‚Äì2018 on Promotion of Open Government (hereinafter Action Plan) which addresses anti-corruption, through public consultations with the help of proposals of several NGOs. = Anti-Corruption General Directorate = The Anti-Corruption (bribery) General Directorate with the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established by the Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan No.114 dated March 3, 2004. Directorate General is a body specialized in the field of preliminary investigation conducted on the corruption crimes, and is subordinated to the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Main responsibilities of the Directorate include: consideration and investigation of complaints received in relation to corruption offenses; to institute criminal proceedings and conduct a preliminary investigation of corruption crimes; carry out operational-search activities to prevent, detect and disclose corruption crimes; on the basis of orders of the Directorate to oversee the implementation of laws during the implementation of operational-search measures on corruption crimes by other bodies of operational and search activities; compensation for material damage caused as a result of corruption offenses as well as to implement legal measures to enable confiscation of property; get acquainted with measures on fight against corruption; collect, analyze and summarize information on offenses relating to corruption; to enhance the effectiveness of the fight against corruption make proposals and recommendations; ensure the implementation of safety measures of witnesses, victims, defendants and others involved in criminal proceedings during the preliminary investigation of corruption crimes, as well as during the trial of these crimes; via the Prosecutor General to regularly inform the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the commission for combating corruption about the measures undertaken in the field of fight against corruption; cooperate with the government and other authorities in the field of fighting corruption; to inform the public on their activities, to ensure transparency in its activities, etc. = Civil Service Commission = Corrupt practices, including nepotism and cronyism, were widespread in civil service recruitment in Azerbaijan until 2005. Azerbaijan did not have the necessary legislative and institutional basis to prevent corruption in one of the most important sectors of public administration. The widespread practice used in the recruitment of personnel was based on recommendations and bribes. In addition, Azerbaijan did not have a merit-based recruitment system and the Chief Executives of the executive bodies had wide discretion in appointing any personnel. In 2005, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) was established by Presidential Decree, with the commission legally authorized to conduct civil service recruitment and to place candidates in state positions in a centralized manner based on competition and objective evaluation (OECD Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan, 2016). Furthermore, the CSC has powers to audit the ethics compliance of civil servants and to implement state policy on supplementary education, attestation and the social protection of civil servants. The CSC has reduced the risk of corruption and has prevented the use of personal affiliations in the civil service recruitment system. Some loopholes are still present in the recruitment system: the OECD Anti-Corruption Network has pointed out that new preventive regulations should also cover the recruitment of high-level civil servants. = ASAN Service = Issues of corruption in public service delivery were one of the problematic areas within the public sector. Citizens faced administrative burdens and bureaucratic barriers in obtaining basic public services. In some situations, citizens were extorted to pay bribes to obtain public services. To eliminate corruption in public service delivery, a new preventive institution, namely the Azerbaijan service assessment network (ASAN) (asan means ‚Äúeasy‚Äù in the Azerbaijani) was established by Presidential Decree in 2012. Currently, this institution provides 34 services for 10 state bodies. It was the first one-stop-shop service delivery model in the world to provide the services of various state bodies rather than only the services of one state body. No conflict of interest exists between ASAN service employees and Azerbaijani citizens as ASAN service employees do not provide any kind of service themselves. All services are provided by the employees of the 10 state bodies under one roof, based on the standards of the ASAN service. Employees of the ASAN service monitor the work of the state bodies, check for compliance with ethics rules and manage the queue system. Monitoring report by OECD has praised Azerbaijan \\"for advancing Azerbaijani Service and Assessment Network (ASAN) centers, which has contributed to eliminating the conditions that are conducive to corruption when delivering various administrative services to the public\\". Azerbaijan 2016 report by EEAS acknowledged ASAN services have been a great help in the elimination of corruption and bribery, as well as removing bureaucracy in public service delivery. A similar institution is planned to be established in Afghanistan as well. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the State Agency for Public Service and Social Innovations under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Afghanistan on July 12, 2016. The aim of the Memorandum is to establish a public service delivery mechanism in Afghanistan based on Azerbaijani model ‚ÄúASAN service‚Äù. = Judicial-Legal Council (JLC) = The Judicial-Legal Council (JLC), established in 2005, is an independent body and has organizational and financial independence. It is financed from the state budget and its prospective year's budget cannot be less than the previous year's budget. The JLC has 15 members, nine of whom are judges, while five are from the Prosecutor General's Office and the Bar Association of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and one member is from the executive body. The JLC has the competence to carry out the selection of candidate judges and to undertake evaluation, promotion and transfer of judges. Those members of the JLC who are not judges are also granted immunity. The JLC has the authority to bring judges to account in terms of disciplinary liability; to discuss the issue of terminating the term of judges; and to propose this course of action to the relevant state body. Furthermore, the JLC has the right to endorse the Prosecutor General's Office to initiate criminal proceedings against judges and to temporarily suspend them from their position. The JLC also analyzes the activities of judges and the organization of the courts; submits proposals regarding the improvement of legislation related to courts and judges; and arranges specialized courses, and relevant seminars and training to raise the level of professionalism of judges. The JLC convenes the Judges‚Äô Selection Committee which has the right to select candidates for vacant judicial posts. This committee is composed of 11 members, who include judges, JLC staff, representatives of the respective executive body and the Prosecutor General's Office, defence lawyers and academics.  Legal framework for the work of the anti-corruption  The main anti-corruption law, the Law of 2004 on Combating Corruption, which defines the directions of the fight against corruption, was adopted on 13 January 2004. This law, which consists of the following four chapters, defines the main principles and framework for fighting against corruption: (i) general provisions; (ii) prevention of corruption; (iii) criminalization of corruption; and (iv) removal of the proceeds of corruption offences. This law explained the notion of corruption; introduced a list of corruption offences (stipulating that these offences will give rise to civil, administrative and criminal liability); identified specialized anti-corruption agencies (ACAs); and regulated the general rules on asset declarations, the rule of restrictions on gifts and the prohibition on working together for those who are next of kin. In 2006, a new chapter on corruption offences was added to the Azerbaijani Criminal Code. It is important to note that this existing criminal legislation fully addresses the requirements of UNCAC's Article 15 (Bribery of national public officials); Article 16 (Bribery of foreign public officials and officials of public international organizations); and Article 21 (Bribery in the private sector), which together criminalize the active and passive bribery of national/foreign public officials as well as persons carrying out organizational-administrative or administrative-economic functions in commercial and non-commercial organizations. UNCAC's Article 17 (Embezzlement, misappropriation or other diversion of property by a public official) and Article 22 (Embezzlement of property in the private sector) are criminalized in the Azerbaijani Criminal Code along with Article 178 (Fraud) and Article 179 (Misappropriation and embezzlement of property). Even though public officials are not specified as the subject of Articles 178 and 179, an aggravating condition for both criminal offences is commission of the offence by any person through the use of his/her service position, with this including public officials and people working in the private sector (E-qanun.az, 2016). UNCAC's Article 18 (Trading in influence) and Article 19 (Abuse of power) are not mandatory provisions, but both active/passive trading in influence and abuse of power were criminalized in the Azerbaijani Criminal Code with Article 308 (Abuse of power) and Article 312-1 (Trading in influence). Illicit enrichment, UNCAC non-mandatory requirement, is not criminalized in Azerbaijan's national legislation. Very few states have introduced this corruption offence to their criminal legislation: different controversies about this issue include the point that a reversal of the burden of proof is used in illicit enrichment (Dionisie and Checchi, 2007). To elaborate, in illicit enrichment, public officials are obliged to explain the source of a significant increase in his/her assets and financial situation. It is important to note that the reversal of the burden of proof is contrary to the principles of the presumption of innocence and the protection of property, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights (Huseynov, 2014). In addition, the Azerbaijani Criminal Code criminalizes the laundering of the proceeds of crime and its concealment: this legislation fully complies with the mandatory obligation arising from UNCAC's Article 23 (Laundering of proceeds of crime) and Article 24 (Concealment). Article 193-1 of the Criminal Code includes two crimes on money laundering. Firstly, the Criminal Code criminalizes the concealment of the real source, disposition, movement or ownership of the rights to money resources and other property, knowing that they have been obtained through illegal acts. Secondly, the Criminal Code criminalizes the carrying out of financial operations, the conversion or the transfer of proceeds of crime. The Criminal Code provides for the criminal liability of legal persons with criminal charges incurring the following: sanctions, confiscation, depriving a legal person of the right to engage in certain activities, or liquidation of a legal entity. Even though Azerbaijan's national domestic legislation on the criminal liability of legal persons is advanced, it is not functional as no specific procedures on the criminal liability of legal persons have been adopted in the Criminal Procedure Code. The Criminal Code is not self-executing law: each liability or measure in the Criminal Code has to be regulated with the Criminal Procedure Code. Azerbaijan's national domestic legislation complies with the requirements of UNCAC's Article 29 (Statute of limitations). Article 75 of the Azerbaijani Criminal Code indicates that a person shall be released from criminal liability if the following time limits have expired since the commission of the act: * two years after the commission of a crime not representing big public danger * seven years after the commission of a less-grave crime * twelve (12) years after the commission of a grave crime * twenty (20) years after the commission of an especially grave crime. The Criminal Code specifies that the limitation period is to be counted from the day the crime is committed to the time the court verdict is entered. If a new crime is committed, the limitation period for each crime should be counted separately. The statute of limitations should be stopped if the accused is evading the investigation for the court trial. In this situation, the limitation period should be resumed at the time of detaining the accused or his/her acknowledgement of guilt. = Preventive anti-corruption legislation = UNCAC's Article 5 (Preventive anti-corruption policies and practices) requires member states to develop and implement or to maintain effective, coordinated anti-corruption policies. In the last 10 years, the Azerbaijani government has adopted five anti-corruption programs: * State Program on Combating Corruption (2004‚Äì2006) * National Strategy on Increasing Transparency and Fighting Against Corruption (2007‚Äì2011) * National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2012‚Äì2015) * National Action Plan for Promoting Open Government (2012‚Äì2015) * National Action Plan for Promoting Open Government (2016‚Äì2018) All state programs and action plans were adopted with Presidential Decrees. In the state programs, key anti-corruption laws were adopted; the specialized ACAs began functioning; reforms were implemented in state institutions; and efficient cooperative relationships with CSOs were established. Azerbaijan has ratified all international documents on the fight against corruption. The implemented reforms have positively impacted on economic development, with Azerbaijan becoming a world leader in gross domestic product (GDP) during 2005‚Äì2006. As a result of the measures implemented to strengthen financial control, the state budget was dramatically increased. Within Azerbaijan's national anti- corruption strategies, national legislation was brought into line with the requirements of international conventions on the fight against corruption. In addition, the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code were amended to criminalize active/passive bribery, trading in influence, abuse of power and other corruption-related offences. These corruption offences were all included in the category of grave crimes. Furthermore, the new Law of 2014 on the Prevention of the Legalization of Criminally Obtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism was adopted and respective changes were made to the Criminal Code to criminalize money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Law of 2011 on Reviewing Citizens‚Äô Appeals was amended to reduce the time taken in reviewing corruption-related appeals by state bodies and to receive and respond to appeals in electronic form. One of the key preventive legislative Acts, the Law of 2005 on Access to Information was adopted on 5 December 2005. This law specified the scope of information that should be disclosed by state bodies and indicated the methods to be used for disclosing information and the types of information to be disclosed. In addition, it required state bodies to designate responsible structures or public officials to provide information regarding the work of state bodies. More than 30 laws were amended to satisfy the implementation of this law. The electronic database of Azerbaijan's national legislation was established and made publicly available. The Law of 2007 on Rules of Ethics Conduct of Civil Servants was adopted as were ethics codes for the sectors of prosecutors, judges and employees of the Ministries of Customs and Taxes. This law provided 15 ethics conduct rules including rules: on gifts; impermissibility of acquiring material and non-material gifts, privileges and concessions; prevention of corruption; prevention of conflict of interest; and use of information and property. Article 13 (Prevention of corruption) of the Law of 2007 on Rules of Ethics Conduct of Civil Servants indicates that a civil servant shall refuse any offered illegal material/non-material gifts or privileges. In the case that those gifts and privileges are given for reasons not depending on the actions of the civil servant, he/she should disclose them to the head of the state body and must return those benefits to the state body. Article 14 (Prohibition on accepting gifts) of this law provides that the civil servant shall not demand or accept any gift which may influence his/her work. However, a civil servant can accept the gift as a sign of hospitality but this should not exceed the value of ‚Ç¨30. If a civil servant is not sure whether he/she should accept the gift, he/she must consult with his/her immediate supervisor.

Bradford's arrest, 1951 Fingerprint section of the arrest report of civil rights pioneer Lillie Mae Bradford Bradford's arrest report On May 11, 1951, Bradford saw that the bus driver had punched her ticket for the wrong price, apparently \\"a costly and frequently recurring error if it was indeed an error\\". Bradford asked to be charged the correct price, and after being told twice to return to the back of the bus, she sat down in the front. > The 20-year-old was going home from her job caring for disabled white > children. She had paid for a transfer on to another bus but, as often > happened, the driver had punched it in the wrong place. If she did nothing > about it she would have ended up paying for the mistake. > > \\"I thought if I don't get up and start speaking for my rights, I never will. > It was humiliating. It was not dignified,\\" Ms Bradford said. \\"It was off > limits to go up to the front of the bus but I went up there and I told him > that my ticket hadn't been punched right. He said: 'Nigger, go to the back > of the bus' and I said: 'I will, as soon as you give me the right transfer > or give me my money back.' And then I took a seat in the white folks' > section\\". > > The driver never fixed the punch card and Bradford never left the front > seat. She was arrested for disorderly conduct, booked, fingerprinted and > paid a small fine. She was held by police for disorderly conduct until a neighbor bailed her out. The arrest followed her throughout her life; she said it had prevented her several times from getting jobs she applied for. In 2006, she commented, There was always a box that said: Do you have a criminal record?' she recalled. 'I went for federal clerk positions, and I would pass the tests, but I wouldn't get the job. That's when I came to the conclusion that it was because I had a police record. Aftermath: pardon and Rosa Parks Act On April 3, 2006, a proposal by Thad McClammy (a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives) to offer a formal pardon to civil rights activists was expected to appear before the Alabama Senate. There was some resistance to it: some activists did not want to be pardoned since, they said, they never committed any crimes to begin with. The Rosa Parks Act was passed in April 2006, and allowed activists who had been arrested or their family members to request a pardon. In 2007, when similar legislation in Tennessee was making it through the legislature, Bradford's arrest was invoked again: \\"Bradford, a retired school custodian, knows that having her record cleared now won't have any real effect, but she wants to apply for a pardon certificate anyway. 'I want to have it removed, frame it, and put it on the wall,' Bradford said. 'It will show I was arrested fighting for my rights. Later life and death Bradford lived in the Ridgecrest neighborhood of Montgomery with her sister Helen, and died in her sleep on 14 March 2017; she was buried at Montgomery's Greenwood Serenity Memorial Gardens, on March 22.

Media appearances From 1981 to 1997, Wilbanks appeared on television over 30 times as a criminology expert. These appearances included four on CNN's Crossfire and two on CBS' 60 Minutes. He appeared on multiple televised debates in which he argued that Prentice Rasheed, a shopkeeper in Dade County, Florida, should be indicted for setting a booby trap that killed a suspected burglar. Despite this, Rasheed was not indicted by the grand jury. After the jury made this decision, Wilbanks said, \\"People are thinking, if the police don't do the job, then I can do whatever I want. That's bad news. I don't think any of us wants to live in a booby-trapped society.

Shiner argued that the proposed number of residential units was too high which would create too much traffic in the neighborhood, while Markham councillor Howard Ian Shore and the developer countered that the project would not be viable if the number of residential units was lowered below the agreed-upon figure. As of 2018, the project has not proceeded and the original mall remains standing and operating.

The centre provides education in both combat and non-combat operations. * The Corps' facilities are located in Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh state.  History  Army Educational Corps Training College and Centre, Pachmarhi has its origin dating back to 24 Apr 1921 when on being sanctioned by Army HQ India, Army School of Education was established with two separate wings, namely, the British Wing at Wellington and the Indian Wing at Belgaum in 1924. General HQ India decided to amalgamate the two wings under one commandant in view of the economy drive of the government and to establish a centralized control over both wings of the school. Accordingly, the British Wing was moved from Wellington to Belgaum on 11 Nov 1924 to form the Army School of Education India, Belgaum . The schools got amalgamated under one commandant in 1931. The orders were issued for final integration of both the wings of the Army School of Education; thus in Oct 1931 both the wings i.e. the British and Indian wings were combined. Another historical development took place in Oct 1939 when the Army School of Education India moved from Belgaum to Pachmarhi to cope with the war time education and the release period education schemes during and after World War-II. With India getting Independence in 1947, the Army School of Education, India, was redesignated as Army School of Education, Pachmarhi. Army Educational Corps Records office was established in the same year as part of the school. The school was again redesignated as AEC Centre and School, Pachmarhi in 1949. AEC Centre and School was redesignated as AEC Training College and Centre after it was affiliated to Dr. Hari Singh Gaur Vishwavidyalaya, Sagar, in 1961. This affiliation marked the introduction of degree courses - Bachelor of Education in 1961, Bachelor of Library Science in 1962, later renamed as Bachelor of Library and Info Science in 1981, and Diploma in Audio-visual and fundamental education in 1962, later upgraded to a degree course named as Bachelor of Education Technology. On 26 May 1985, the College attained the status of an Autonomous College under the same university. The autonomy was initially granted for a period of three years up to 1988 and later extended from time to time. As per the policy of the Government of MP, the jurisdiction of University of MP was restructured on geographical proximity and thus wef 1995, this autonomous college was affiliated to Barkatullah Universities, Bhopal. The Educational training of the Indian Army started with the establishment of the East India Company. There was neither a regular army nor a uniform system for training of troops in till the beginning of the eighteenth century. The Educational system was evolved for the Company's army for their own benefit and because of the persistent demand of the men. As the Company army comprised the British troops, the Company's European troops and the Indian troops, the Educational training was separately evolved for them. The nature of the Company army, the socio-political and military development both in and were the prime factors responsible for the establishment of an Educational system for the army. The beginning of an educational system for the army in can be traced back to the establishment of the British Regimental Schools. Some of the British Regiments had brought sergeants with them for the purpose of imparting instructions to their troops. But the number of schoolmasters and mistresses were negligible in proportion to the strength of the troops. As a result, the commanding officers were permitted to appoint educationally qualified non- commissioned officers as acting masters. The Company's European troops made a similar request for the provision of educational facilities for them and their children. The Company and the masters acceded to the request and mistresses were posted in Regimental Schools for European troops to impart instruction to their troops and their children. Under the patronage of Warren Hastings, the then Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of India, a number of Regimental schools were opened and barrack libraries were established for European troops in between 1774 and 1785. The Indian sepoys formed a major part of the Company's army and their number continuously increased to reach 2,14,000 in 1856. Indian troops belonged to various castes, tribes and religions. Some part of general education was required for them as they were basically illiterate but the East India Company, which by then had transformed itself from a commercial concern to a political organisation and was busy with the task of conquest and consolidation of British power in India, had neither time nor inclination for the education of Indian sepoys. The following factors compelled the Company to make provisions for educational facilities for the Indian troops: * To keep pace with the general development in the field of education in the army. The educational facilities had been provided to the British troops and the Company's European troops and the education for the Indian troops who formed the bulk of the Company's army could no longer be ignored. * To keep pace with the general development in the field of civil education * Wood's despatch laid the foundation of a sound educational system for the Indians. In the wake of general awareness amongst the masses the East India Company could no longer ignore the education of Indian sepoys.  Modernisation Drive - Evolving With Time  Based on the evolving professional requirements in consonance with emerging technologies, the equipment modernisation projects for the Corps are set down as under:- (a) Hi-tech Classrooms. Upgradation of the existing class rooms using modern audio visual equipment such as computers and Video Projection Systems would be an inescapable requirement in the future for multi-sensory instruction. (b) Intranet. This would imply the automation of all functional areas, with nodes available for major functionaries and would later be integrated with the Army Intranet, once permitted. (c) Instructional Monitoring System. This would allow the senior management to monitor all instruction from a single location, thereby fostering greater accountability and commitment. (d) Internet & Media Connectivity. The unlimited sweep of the Internet is required to be harnessed and integrated with day-to-day functioning of the College. Networked terminal labs are proposed to be set up in areas of need. (e) Fully Automated Library. Most libraries are planned to be fully automated with an integrated library management system to enhance functional efficiency. (f) Computer-based Language Labs. Computer-based language labs with the requisite software would facilitate the teaching of English, foreign and regional languages and would allow the use of the latest language teaching software. (g) GIS for Map Reading Training. Integrating the Geographical Information System technology into map reading training would allow the trainees to acquire skills in the use of this state-of-the-art technology in the larger interests of the Indian Army. (h) CBT Production Centre. With the present emphasis on multi-sensory instruction, a modern, well-equipped CBT production centre at the College would facilitate the integration of CBT into all courses of instruction run by the AEC in various areas of functioning throughout the Army.  Preparing for The Future  The AEC may be required to undertake an additional charter in the following areas in the future:- (a) Stress Management & Counseling (b) Clerks Training (c) Educational Rehabilitation and Civic Action (d) Training of Trainers (e) Instruction in Ethics and Morality (f) Computer Training for Recruits (g) Education of Wards of Servicemen References Indian Army ","title":"Army Education Corps (India)"},{"id":"53575558","text":"is the 14th single by Japanese model-singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, released on April 5, 2017.

Bangladesh war of liberation  He received training in Meghalaya and joined the guerrilla group of Mukti Bahini afterwards, which operated primarily in the Sunamganj Netrokona Habiganj river,or 'Haor', area. His group was known to the local people as Das Party. According to Abdul Kaium, one fellow commander of Das, the name of \\"Das party\\" was officially approaved by the Bangladesh Liberation Army. Das operated a number of guerrilla missions, such as the Paharpur operation, the Baniachong police station attack, and the Badalpur operation, driving out the Pakistani military from the region. Given the Pakistani Army's use of waterways as supply routes, the Das and other members of the group launched an assault on he Pakistani forces on October 16, 1971, cutting the military's supply lines. A bounty was subsequently placed on Das' head.  Death  On November 16, 1971, the Das party was attacked by the Pakistani army and was forced into retreat. Das got cornered and was shot dead in the assault. Pakistan army and local Rajakars retrieved his dead body near the bank of a river and hanged his lifeless body with an electric pillar of the local Ajmiriganj bazar.  Memoirs  In 1972, he was awarded with the Bir Bikrom, the highest gallantry award by Bangladesh Betar as the first civilian freedom fighter. However, the Bangladeshi government did not award him the medal until two decades later.

The cellar is estimated to contain around 39,000 bottles of wine and spirits estimated at a value of over ¬£2 million. The cellar is managed day-to-day by the Government Butler and is overseen by the head of Government Hospitality coming under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Office. It was originally stocked on the advice of the Government Hospitality Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine, a quango that was abolished in 2010. Before its abolition, the committee met two or three times a year in the cellar, around a table carved from an elm tree that blew down in St James's Park in around 1830. The role of the committee was to taste the wines, make recommendations for new purchases to keep the cellar stocked, and to sell a portion on the open market to fund the restocking process. They also graded the wines and offered serving suggestions. Since 2010 cellar has been stocked according to recommendations from a specialist committee of Masters of Wine, chaired by a former diplomat. Aside from the Government Butler, access to the cellar is strictly limited to Permanent Secretaries and Ministers. The wine is served according to a complex system. Ministers are asked to give their preferences when they take office. Food being served at the banquet or function is usually factored in. National sensitivities and customs are also considered ‚Äì for example when there is a Chinese delegation vintages from 1988 are used, as '8' is considered a lucky number in China.

Introduction =Iron ore= Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)¬∑n(H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). Roughly 98% of iron ore on the global market is used in iron and steel production.Australia, G. (2008, January 23). Iron Fact Sheet. Retrieved March 23, 2017, from http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/education/fact_sheets/iron.html =Mining and processing= Common methods of extracting the iron ore consist of blasting, drilling, or general excavating,Alderon Iron Ore Corp (2011): http://www.ecc.gov.nl.ca/env_assessment/projects/Y2011/1611/index.html. Iron Ore Company of Canada (2013) Wabush 3 Open Pit Mine Project in Labrador West: http://www.ecc.gov.nl.ca/env_assessment/projects/Y2013/1711/index.html.,.Labrador Iron Mines Ltd. (2010) Schefferville Iron Ore Mine (James and Redmond Properties): http://www.ecc.gov.nl.ca/env_assessment/projects/Y2010/1379/index.html. Most iron ore is produced from open-pit mines. After the iron ore is out of the ground, it may be shipped to the iron and steel manufacturing plant. If the ore contains less than 60 percent iron, it is usually beneficiated to an iron- ore concentrate typically containing greater than 60 percent iron. This is done by separating the iron minerals from the valueless minerals, usually by magnetic, gravity, or froth floatation. Issues =Air quality= The main sources of emissions during both the construction and operation phases include the products of combustion such as nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide and fugitive dust from the operation of equipment.Sumi, L., Thomsen S. (May 11, 2001) Mining in Remote Areas: Issues and Impacts - A Community Primer: Mining Watch Canada http://miningwatch.ca/sites/default/files/mine_impacts_kit_1.pdf. The main sources of combustion-related emissions during both the construction and operation phases are related to diesel generators, fuel-oil boilers, and from on-site road traffic. Fugitive dust emissions can occur during land clearing, ground excavation, and from equipment traffic on site. Potential sources of fugitive dust during operation include ore loading and unloading, ore crushing, stockpile erosion, and dust from conveyor systems around the site. Fugitive dust emissions are proportional to the disturbed land area and the level of activity and vary substantially from day to day with varying meteorological conditions. The major effects of industrial air pollution on wildlife include direct mortality, weakening industrial-related injury and disease, and physiological and psychological stressNewman, J. R. (1979). Effects of industrial air pollution on wildlife. Biological Conservation,15(3), 181-190. doi:10.1016/0006-3207(79)90039-9 =Acid rock drainage= Acid is created when water and oxygen interact with sulphur bearing minerals and chemicals in rocks. Sulphuric acid is the most common chemical reaction that results from mining activities as the beneficiation process requires dissolving the minerals surrounding the ore, which releases metals and chemicals previously bound up in the rock into nearby streams, freshwater bodies, and the atmosphere.., . Acid may be generated under natural conditions prior to any disturbance, but mining activities typically magnify the amount of acid produced, thereby causing an inequality in the surrounding environment. This process is referred to as Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). Acid produced from AMD causes health hazards to many fish and aquatic organisms as well as land animals who drink from contaminated water sources. Many metals become mobile as water becomes more acidic and at high concentrations these metals become toxic to most life forms Marshy (7041418469) =Wetlands and flora= Some mines require the draining of nearby wetlands for the beneficiation process and the cooling of project machinery, which affects downstream water quality and water quantity, and flora and fauna . Wetlands include bogs, fens, marsh, swamps, and shallow water. Wetlands serve a number of functional purposes in the biosphere such as collecting and storing surface runoff, moderating stream flows, reducing natural flooding and erosion, cleaning and purifying water, recharging groundwater zones, and providing habitats for plants and animals,.Department of Environment and Climate Change.

Rabinowitz (born January 17, 1957) is a political image maker, media strategist, publicist, and event planner whose primary work is for progressive, Democratic, and Jewish causes. In 2004, the Jewish Forward named him among the 50 most influential Jews in America. A former Bill Clinton White House press aide, he founded Bluelight Strategies in late 2014 with Aaron Keyak, as a successor to Rabinowitz Communications and Rabinowitz/Dorf Communications. The firm's clients include the Jewish Federations of North America, the Rabbinical Assembly, the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace, the National Jewish Democratic Council, the Lantos Foundation and Israel member of Knesset Erel Margalit. At Bluelight, Rabinowitz was a founder of Jews for Progress, a pro-Israel super PAC to boost support for 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton among Jews in swing states. In 2012, Rabinowitz was instrumental in creating The Hub, which worked to ensure the Jewish vote for President Barack Obama's reelection.  Biography  Steve Rabinowitz, the only child of the late Dorothy and Harold Rabinowitz, grew up in Tucson, Arizona. He attended Tucson High School and the University of Arizona. He and his wife, Laurie Moskowitz, senior director for U.S. campaigns at the ONE Campaign, live in Washington, D.C., with their two sons, Jake and Sammy.  Political career  Rabinowitz's political campaign work began in 1975-76 when at age 18 he was national youth coordinator for Democrat Mo Udall's presidential campaign. He subsequently worked on the national staffs of the presidential campaigns of Jerry Brown, John Anderson, Gary Hart, Walter Mondale, Paul Simon, Michael Dukakis, Bob Kerrey, and Bill Clinton. He headed Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign press advance team, During that campaign cycle, he became widely known as \\"the rabbi,\\" a play on his last name, hosting the Yom Kippur break fast at his rented home in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Clinton credits Rabinowitz with coming up with the term Hillaryland. During the 1992 Bill Clinton campaign and working with his colleague Jeff Eller, Rabinowitz helped remake the classic political town hall meeting, routinely placing Clinton in the center of a \\"bowl\\" of seated voters, surrounded and tiered on at least three sides, while Eller worked with local television stations for live regional and even national broadcast, and Clinton left the stool in the center of the audience and engaged individual, unscripted questioners, regardless of where they sat or the camera angle it produced. The format has been replicated countless times.  The White House  In 1993, Rabinowitz was named Bill Clinton's White House director of media planning, responsible for the visual images of the president's public appearances. He helped produce the peace treaty signings between Israel and the Palestinians on the White House South Lawn in September 1993, and between Israel and Jordan in the Arava in October 1994. Rabinowitz produced an East Room presidential signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), witnessed by three of Clinton's predecessors ‚Äì Presidents George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. Steve Rabinowitz with Presidents (left to right) Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton (White House photo/Robert McNeely) Also in 1993, Rabinowitz organized and led the first White House Passover seder for 50 Clinton White House and Administration staff. The traditional event was held in the Indian Treaty Room and catered kosher.  QRS NewMedia  QRS NewMedia, a company Rabinowitz co-founded with Laura Quinn and Mark Steitz, handled satellite feeds and radio actualities for the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. Using technology that Rabinowitz brought to national politics for Bill Clinton in 1992, QRS added census data and Nielsen research on each of the nation's television stations to produce breakdowns of viewing audiences, providing campaigns and political strategists with detailed information, including demographics, lifestyles and family income, on who watches what news program. QRS also has created high-tech media presentations for political, government and corporate entities, and consulted nearly every subsequent Democratic Party presidential nominee and convention since.  Major Jewish/Pro-Israel Events  Rabinowitz helped organize a 2002 Israel rally in Washington, DC, on the West Front of the Capitol that drew an estimated crowd of 100,000 and the Israel@60 celebration on the National Mall in 2008. The Israel@60 celebration featured a wide range of performers. Rabinowitz assisted with traditional advertising and guerilla marketing for the event, attracting 50,000-75,000 people.  The Hub  During Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, Rabinowitz helped create the Jewish Media Hub (The Hub), a political nonprofit directed at boosting the incumbent president's standing among American Jews. Employing mico-targeting and micro-websites, as well as other media, the group focused on differentiating Obama from Republican challenger Mitt Romney, highlighting differences on Israel, how to approach Iran's nuclear program, women's reproductive rights, gay marriage, and other social issues. In 2014, Rabinowitz, Marc Stanley and Fran Katz Watson launched Jewish Americans Ready for Hillary to support a 2016 presidential run for Hillary Clinton in the Jewish community. In 2016, Rabinowitz helped kick off and run Jews for Progress, a political action committee created to defend Hillary Clinton and persuade Jewish voters in swing states to support her. Employing tactics much like those used in The Hub, the No Nukes for Iran Project, which Rabinowitz advised and that supported the Obama administration's nuclear agreement with Iran, and Jews for Progress both used video, print, online and social media advertising and phones to target Jewish voters and influentials. In the case of Jews for Progress, polling showed a subsequent increase in the Jewish vote for Clinton over that for Barack Obama four years earlier, as all other Democratic Party base groups votes dropped. In addition to serving on the national staffs of nine presidential campaigns, Rabinowitz also was an informal adviser to the presidential campaigns of the Bill Clinton re-elect in 1996, Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, both Hillary Clinton campaigns (2008 and 2016), and both Barack Obama campaigns (2008 and 2012). He produced Al Gore's official announcement for president in his hometown of Carthage, Tennessee. Among the many other campaigns on which he worked as a paid staffer were Jim Florio and Peter Shapiro, both for governor of New Jersey, Carolyn Warner for governor of Arizona, and Pat Leahy for re-election to the U.S. Senate from Vermont. And, in 1980 Rabinowitz ran for office ‚Äì unsuccessfully ‚Äì seeking the school board in the Catalina Foothills School District in northern Tucson.  Music promoter  In the 1980s and between political campaigns, Rabinowitz worked as a music promoter in Tucson, Arizona, producing concerts, music festivals and shows, an extended play (EP) Rock & Roll record and a Country Punk cassette tape, as well as radio shows, all featuring local bands. And, in 1984, Universal Pictures hired a number of recent Gary Hart campaign staff ‚Äì including Rabinowitz ‚Äì to manage the openings of its controversial film The Last Temptation of Christ around the country. They coordinated local media coverage and worked with various theater management and local police to contain the protests; when protests began to wane, they worked to generate larger, media-enticing demonstrations. Rabinowitz also organized the Washington premier of director Spike Lee's 1989 movie Do The Right Thing.  Board and volunteer service  Active at Adas Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C., Rabinowitz is assistant treasurer, having served for years as vice president for membership and external affairs. He also is active in the synagogue's traditional egalitarian minyan. In 2016, he and his wife were honored by the Jewish Primary Day School of the Nation's Capital, where he chaired the annual Rabin lecture for many years. He has served on the executive committee of the National Jewish Democratic Council and of Avodah.

Two arrests were made in connection with the threats and Michael Ron David Kadar, a dual American-Israeli citizen, has been convicted. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Theories Media speculation made by the ADL in January 2017 promoted the view that the threats were the responsibility of \\"right wing Christians in the United States\\". The same month, Jerry Silverman of the Jewish Federations of North America said the threats were part of a \\"coordinated effort\\" to intimidate American Jews. In February, during an interview on CNN, U.S. Congressman Jerrold Nadler said that some supporters of Donald Trump were responsible for the threats. In an op-ed for The Baltimore Sun, deputy editor Tricia Bishop said the threats represent a growing attitude of racial intolerance in the United States, but probably no specific group or person was responsible for the threats. She implored readers to \\"stand up ... before it's your children they come for\\". Suspects In March 2017, two persons were arrested on separate charges of making a number of the bomb threats: =African-American journalist= Juan M. Thompson, a former journalist for The Intercept, was charged with responsibility for at least eight of the incidents. According to media reports, Thompson had called in the threats in an attempt to frame a woman whom he had previously dated. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the woman had been the subject of previous harassment by Thompson, which included an alleged attempt by him to falsely report her for possession of child pornography. On 13 June 2017, Thompson pleaded guilty to sending bomb threats to Jewish community centers. =Israeli-American man= A 19-year-old Jewish Israeli-American named as Michael Ron David Kadar, was arrested in March 2017 in Ashkelon, Israel and charged with responsibility for \\"dozens\\" of the threats. The man had earlier been rejected from enlistment in the Israel Defense Forces due to mental health issues. According to Israeli police, the man had used \\"advanced technologies\\" to disguise his voice and mask the fact the calls were originating from Israel. According to court documents, the man allegedly advertised on the dark web the service of threatening any school for $30. The man's defense attorney said he has a brain tumor, which may have influenced his behavior. He was suspected of threatening over 2,000 different institutions in the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia including the Israeli Embassy in Washington, the Israeli consulate in Miami, schools, malls, police stations, hospitals and airlines. His threats reportedly caused fighter jets to be scrambled, planes to dump fuel and make emergency landings, and schools to evacuate. In April 2017, an indictment against the man was filed in an Israeli court charging him with several crimes including an attempt to extort a United States senator, \\"publishing false reports causing public panic, conspiring to commit a crime, hacking computers to commit a crime, and violations of money-laundering laws\\". In the same month, a similar indictment was filed against him in a federal court in Florida charging him with 28 crimes, and he was separately charged with 3 additional crimes in a federal court in Georgia. Israeli authorities reportedly refused to extradite him to the US, preferring to try him in Israel. In June 2018, he was convicted on hundreds of counts including charges of extortion, publishing false information that caused panic, computer offenses, and money laundering. In November 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, plus a fine and 1 year probation. The Israeli media was barred from publishing his name. He would have been sentenced to 17 years if not for his mental issues: autism spectrum and paranoid delusions. Described as highly intelligent, his crimes earned him $240,000 in Bitcoin, worth over $1 million at the time of the sentence. Kadar refused to hand over the password to his Bitcoin digital wallet.

The unraveling of heterogenous cell populations, reconstruction of cellular developmental trajectories, and modeling of transcriptional dynamics ‚Äî all previously masked in bulk transcriptome measurements ‚Äî are made possible through analysis of this transcriptomic data.  Background  Gene expression analysis has become routine through the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays. RNA analysis that was previously limited to tracing individual transcripts by Northern blots or quantitative PCR is now used frequently to characterize the expression profiles of populations of thousands of cells. The data produced from the bulk based assays has led to the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in distinct cell populations and biomarker discovery. These genomic studies are limited as they provide measurements for whole tissues and as a result show an average expression profile for all the constituent cells. In multicellular organisms different cell types within the same population can have distinct roles and form subpopulations with different transcriptional profiles. Correlations in the gene expression of the subpopulations can often be missed due to the lack of subpopulation identification. Moreover, bulk assays fail to identify if a change in the expression profile is due to a change in regulation or composition, in which one cell type arises to dominate the population. Lastly, when examining cellular progression through differentiation, average expression profiles are only able to order cells by time rather than their stage of development and are consequently unable to show trends in gene expression levels specific to certain stages. Recent advances in biotechnology allow the measurement of gene expression in hundreds to thousands of individual cells simultaneously. Whilst these breakthroughs in transcriptomics technologies have enabled the generation of single-cell transcriptomic data there are new computational and analytical challenges presented by the data produced. Techniques used for analysing RNA-seq data from bulk cell populations can be used for single-cell data but many new computational approaches have been designed for this data type to facilitate a complete and detailed study of single-cell expression profiles.  Experimental steps  There is currently no standardized technique to generate single-cell data, all methods must include cell isolation from the population, lysate formation, amplification through reverse transcription and quantification of expression levels. Common techniques for measuring expression are quantitative PCR or RNA-seq. = Isolating single cells = Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting workflow (FACS) There are several methods available to isolate and amplify cells for single-cell analysis. Low throughput techniques are able to isolate hundreds of cells, are slow and enable selection. These methods include: * Micropipetting * Cytoplasmic aspiration * Laser capture microdissection. High throughput methods are able to quickly isolate hundreds to tens of thousands of cells. Common techniques include: * Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) * Microfluidic devices = Quantitative PCR (qPCR) = To measure the level of expression of each transcript qPCR can be applied. Gene specific primers are used to amplify the corresponding gene as with regular PCR and as a result data is usually only obtained for sample sizes of less than 100 genes. The inclusion of housekeeping genes, whose expression should be constant under the conditions, is used for normalisation. The most commonly used house keeping genes include GAPDH and Œ±-actin, although the reliability of normalisation through this process is questionable as there is evidence that the level of expression can vary significantly. Fluorescent dyes are used as reporter molecules to detect the PCR product and monitor the progress of the amplification - the increase in fluorescence intensity is proportional to the amplicon concentration. A plot of fluorescence vs. cycle number is made and a threshold fluorescence level is used to find cycle number at which the plot reaches this value. The cycle number at this point is known as the threshold cycle (Ct) and is measured for each gene. = Single-cell RNA-seq = RNA Seq Experiment The Single-cell RNA-seq technique converts a population of RNAs to a library of cDNA fragments. These fragments are sequenced by high- throughput next generation sequencing techniques and the reads are mapped back to the reference genome, providing a count of the number of reads associated with each gene. Normalisation of RNA-seq data accounts for cell to cell variation in the efficiencies of the cDNA library formation and sequencing. One method relies on the use of extrinsic RNA spike-ins (RNA sequences of known sequence and quantity) that are added in equal quantities to each cell lysate and used to normalise read count by the number of reads mapped to spike-in mRNA. Another control uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)-short DNA sequences (6‚Äì10nt) that are added to each cDNA before amplification and act as a bar code for each cDNA molecule. Normalisation is achieved by using the count number of unique UMIs associated with each gene to account for differences in amplification efficiency. A combination of both spike-ins, UMIs and other approaches have been combined for more accurate normalisation. = Considerations = A problem associated with single-cell data occurs in the form of zero inflated gene expression distributions, known as technical dropouts, that are common due to low mRNA concentrations of less-expressed genes that are not captured in the reverse transcription process. The percentage of mRNA molecules in the cell lysate that are detected is often only 10-20%. When using RNA spike-ins for normalisation the assumption is made that the amplification and sequencing efficiencies for the endogenous and spike-in RNA are the same. Evidence suggests that this is not the case given fundamental differences in size and features, such as the lack of a polyadenylated tail in spike-ins and therefore shorter length. Additionally, normalisation using UMIs assumes the cDNA library is sequenced to saturation, which is not always the case.  Data analysis  Insights based on single- cell data analysis assumes that the input is a matrix of normalised gene expression counts, generated by the approaches outline above, and can provide opportunities that are not obtainable by bulk. Three main insights provided: #Identification and characterization of cell types and their spatial organisation in time #Inference of gene regulatory networks and their strength across individual cells #Classification of the stochastic component of transcription The techniques outlined have been designed to help visualise and explore patterns in the data in order to facilitate the revelation of these three features. = Clustering = K-Means-Gaussian-data Iris dendrogram produced using a Hierarchical clustering algorithm Clustering allows for the formation of subgroups in the cell population. Cells can be clustered by their transcriptomic profile in order to analyse the sub-population structure and identify rare cell types or cell subtypes. Alternatively, genes can be clustered by their expression states in order to identify covarying genes. A combination of both clustering approaches, known as biclustering, has been used to simultaneously cluster by genes and cells to find genes that behave similarly within cell clusters. Clustering methods applied can be K-means clustering, forming disjoint groups or Hierarchical clustering, forming nested partitions.  Biclustering  Biclustering provides several advantages by improving the resolution of clustering. Genes that are only informative to a subset of cells and are hence only expressed there can be identified through biclustering. Moreover, similarly behaving genes that differentiate one cell cluster from another can be identified using this method. = Dimensionality reduction= PCA example of Guinean and other African populations Y chromosome haplogroup frequencies Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE can be used to simplify data for visualisation and pattern detection by transforming cells from a high to a lower dimensional space. The result of this method produces graphs with each cell as a point in a 2-D or 3-D space. Dimensionality reduction is frequently used before clustering as cells in high dimensions can wrongly appear to be close due to distance metrics behaving non-intuitively. Principal component analysis The most frequently used technique is PCA, which identifies the directions of largest variance principal components and transforms the data so that the first principal component has the largest possible variance, and successive principle components in turn each have the highest variance possible while remaining orthogonal to the preceding components. The contribution each gene makes to each component is used to infer which genes are contributing the most to variance in the population and are involved in differentiating different subpopulations. = Differential expression = Detecting differences in gene expression level between two populations is used both single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data. Specialised methods have been designed for single-cell data that considers single cell features such as technical dropouts and shape of the distribution e.g. Bimodal vs. unimodal.  Gene ontology enrichment  Gene ontology terms describe gene functions and the relationships between those functions into three classes: #Molecular function #Cellular component #Biological process Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment is a technique used to identify which GO terms are over-represented or under-represented in a given set of genes. In single- cell analysis input list of genes of interest can be selected based on differentially expressed genes or groups of genes generated from biclustering. The number of genes annotated to a GO term in the input list is normalised against the number of genes annotated to a GO term in the background set of all genes in genome to determine statistical significance. = Pseudotemporal ordering = Graph with minimal spanning tree Pseudo-temporal ordering (or trajectory inference) is a technique that aims to infer gene expression dynamics from snapshot single-cell data. The method tries to order the cells in such a way that similar cells are closely positioned to each other. This trajectory of cells can be linear, but can also bifurcate or follow more complex graph structures. The trajectory therefore enables the inference of gene expression dynamics and the ordering of cells by their progression through differentiation or response to external stimuli. The method relies on the assumptions that the cells follow the same path through the process of interest and that their transcriptional state correlates to their progression. The algorithm can be applied to both mixed populations and temporal samples. More than 50 methods for pseudo-temporal ordering have been developed, and each has its own requirements for prior information (such as starting cells or time course data), detectable topologies, and methodology . An example algorithm is the Monocle algorithm that carries out dimensionality reduction of the data, builds a minimal spanning tree using the transformed data, orders cells in pseudo-time by following the longest connected path of the tree and consequently labels cells by type. Another example is DPT, which uses a diffusion map and diffusion process. =Network inference = Gene regulatory network inference is a technique that aims to construct a network, shown as a graph, in which the nodes represent the genes and edges indicate co-regulatory interactions. The method relies on the assumption that a strong statistical relationship between the expression of genes is an indication of a potential functional relationship. The most commonly used method to measure the strength of a statistical relationship is correlation. However, correlation fails to identify non-linear relationships and mutual information is used as an alternative. Gene clusters linked in a network signify genes that undergo coordinated changes in expression. =Integration= Single cell transcriptomics datasets generated using different experimental protocols and under different experimental conditions often differ in the presence or strength of technical effects, and the types of cells observed, among other factors. This results in strong batch effects that may bias the findings of statistical methods applied across batches, particularly in the presence of confounding. As a result of the aforementioned properties of single cell transcriptomic data, batch correction methods developed for bulk sequencing data were observed to perform poorly. This resulted in the development of statistical methods to correct for batch effects that are robust to the properties of single cell transcriptomic data, in order to integrate data from different sources or experimental batches. Foundational work in this regard was performed by Laleh Haghverdi in formulating the use of mutual nearest neighbours between each batch to define batch correction vectors. These vectors can be used to merge datasets that each include at least one shared cell type. An orthogonal approach involves the projection of each dataset onto a shared low-dimensional space using canonical correlation analysis. Mutual nearest neighbours and canonical correlation analysis have also been combined to define integration \\"anchors\\" comprising reference cells in one dataset, to which query cells in another dataset are normalised.

It was founded in 1908, and caters for cruiser sailors, dinghy sailors, motor-boaters and rowers. Its officers include a commodore, vice-commodore, rear-commodore, secretary and treasurer. The club is affiliated to the Royal Yachting Association. Clubhouse Greenwich Yacht Club clubhouse, viewed at low tide The current clubhouse complex was designed by Fankl and Luty and was completed in 1999.The clubhouse is the only building built in the Thames itself being raised upon stilts above the waters below, and is open to the public each year as part of the London Open House. The complex includes an engineering/machining facility, sailoft, woodworking facility, an indoor work area with a capacity for two or more boats, a wedding and conference venue, plus a three storey clubhouse situated on a dolphin in the tidal Thames reached by a bridge from landside. The complex is disabled access friendly. History Thames watermen and river workers founded Greenwich Yacht Club in Yacht Tavern in Greenwich on 10 March 1908. For many years the club met at the tavern. Later the Clubhouse was situated for many years on the beach adjacent to the current clubhouse. Originally, it was a beached Thames Sailing Barge \\"Iverna\\", then later a hut on the Mudlarks beach. In more recent times the club was based in what is known as the \\"old clubhouse\\" at the end of Riverway. That site was required by English Partnerships, as part of the preparation for construction of the Millennium Dome, and in exchange English Partnerships provided the club with new facilities on the previously redundant Peartree Wharf. Greenwich Yacht Club took occupation of the site early in November 1999 with a temporary clubroom in what is now the Wedding Venue. The new clubhouse was opened in June 2000. The residential building directly behind the club has been named Iverna Quay, as a reference to the beached Thames sailing barge \\"Iverna\\". Membership The club has more than 400 members. Training The club is an official Royal Yachting Association training centre, and offers both shorebased and practical RYA courses including Day Skipper Theory and Yachtmaster Theory. Cruising The club has a strong contingent of active cruising yachts and motorboats, and organises an annual cruise to the East Coast of England. Racing Throughout the year the club organises and competes in a number of different races on the Thames for both dinghy and yachts. As part of its centenary celebrations in 2008 an Extreme 40 Catamaran raced between the O2 and the club; competitors included Dame Ellen MacArthur and Olympian Matthew Pinsent. The club abides by the racing rules as set out by World Sailing.

Jackson House, in Baconton, Georgia, is a historic house built in 1898 that now serves as Baconton's city hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The main house was built in 1898 in Late Victorian style. It is a two-story frame house on a brick pier foundation. With . Back of house The house was occupied by George Washington Jackson (1845-1914) then Eulelia Peacock Jackson (1854-1932). The east side of the town of Baconton was developed from land owned by G.W. Jackson, and centered around the Methodist Church to which Jackson belonged. The house is on a slight rise at what was, in 1983, the east end of Walton Street; U.S. Highway 19 was to its east beyond a pecan grove. By 2013, Walton Street was continued and divided to go on both sides of the house and connect to the highway; the street and a gas station/convenience store property and a commercial store property facing the highway infringe upon the former historic property.Google maps street view from June 2013, accessed March 23, 2017 It was one of a number of Baconton area historic properties and districts that were evaluated for NRHP listing in 1983. The 1983 listing included five contributing buildings and one contributing site on . By 2017, development has changed the general area somewhat since the house was listed in 1983. Back then, there were pecan groves stretch on the east, south, and northeast of the house; in 2017 there are baseball fields northeast of the Walton St. & Jackson St. intersection that seem not to have been present in 1983.Google maps satellite view In 1983 there were several dilapidated one-story outbuildings: a barn, a wagon shed, and a crib. And there was a one-story cook's house with two exterior brick chimneys, located on Jackson Street south of the main house. By 2013, the outbuildings are not apparent in Google satellite or street view, suggesting they are gone.
