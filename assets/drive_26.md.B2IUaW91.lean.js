He was also briefly Attorney General and a customs collector for various ports of North Carolina. Biography Christopher Gale was born in 1670 (some sources say 1679) in York, the son of the Rev. Miles Gale and Margaret Stone. He read law under an attorney in Lancashire but Gale migrated to Carolina when he was in his early twenties, settling in Bath. He made his fortune in trade with the Indians. In 1702, Gale married Sarah Laker Harvey, widow of Governor Thomas Harvey. They had four children: Miles, Theophilus, Penelope and Elizabeth.Putnam's monthly historical magazine, Volume 4. 1896 He lived at Kirby Grange, a large plantation near Bath. Career as a Justice In 1703, Proprietary Governor Robert Daniel appointed Gale to serve as a Justice of the General Court, the supreme court of the colony and in 1704, he concurrently was appointed attorney general of Carolina. Following the upheaval of Cary's Rebellion in 1708, Gale was removed from office as Chief Justice by Governor William Glover. Gale traveled to London where the Lords Proprietors of the Carolina colony were meeting to lay his case for reinstatement before them. He was immediately reinstated. Gale was a capable explorer and was slated to go with John Lawson and Baron Christoph de Graffenried on their fateful 1711 expedition into Indian territory. De Graffenreid and Lawson were captured by Tuscarora Indians and Lawson was killed. Gale was unable to join them due to his wife Susan's illness. Gale later reflected that her illness likely saved his life. Later that year Governor Edward Hyde sent him to Charleston, South Carolina to secure military aid for the war against the Tuscarora Indians. On his return trip, Gale was captured by the French who held him briefly as a prisoner of war on Martinique. Finally arriving home in July 1712, Gale was rewarded for his service with a re-appointment as Chief Justice. He held that office, with only brief interruptions, until 1731, during which time he obtained commissions as collector of customs at the ports of Beaufort, Currituck, and Roanoke successively. He also briefly served as the absentee Attorney General of the Bahamas. In 1729, Gale was appointed to a commission to determine the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia along with Colonel John Lovick and William Little. End of life His wife Sarah died in 1730 and Gale married Sarah Catherine Ismay, widow of John Ismay, about 1733. Gale died in 1735 in Edenton, North Carolina leaving a will that stated, ‚ÄúTo All my friends I leave my hearty prayers & Good wishes, To my Enemys forgiveness & prayers for their Repentance for the many ill offices done me.‚ÄùWilliam S.

HamSphere is a subscription-based internet service which simulates amateur radio communication using VoIP connections over the Internet. The simulator allows licensed radio amateurs and unlicensed enthusiasts to communicate with one another using a simulated ionosphere. It was designed by Kelly Lindman, a radio amateur with call sign 5B4AIT. The system allows realistic worldwide connections between amateur radio operators as well as radio enthusiasts. In general it is similar to other VoIP applications (such as Skype), but with the unique addition of characteristics such as channel selection by tuning, modulation, noise effects and shortwave propagation simulation. Before using the system it is necessary for a radio amateur's call sign to be validated. The HamSphere system relies on different amateur online callbooks for verification before his or her call sign is added to the list of validated users. The system may be used without a verified radio amateur license and has a callsign generator providing unique unofficial HamSphere callsigns. The software is written to run on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X or Linux using Java. Also available are mobile editions of the software running on Apple mobile devices (iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad) available from the Apple App Store, and on Android devices from the Google Play Store. The software is available for download as a free trial, but requires a yearly subscription after the free trial expires.  Uses  Operators using the HamSphere software can operate it in two modes: *Simulation mode. This is the unique feature of HamSphere allowing the user to maintain connections under natural realistic conditions. Signals may vary and interference is present giving the user the impression that he or she is using a real shortwave transceiver. *Simulation off mode. This mode entails connection to other operators with the reliability of VoIP (noise-free) while maintaining the other typical characteristics of radio communication.  Operating modes  The HamSphere software has two modulation types: *Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission or DSB is the default mode of operation where the operator uses speech audio/phone. *Continuous wave or CW where the operator utilizes a built-in Morse Code keyer.  Propagation model  The mathematical algorithm for the wave propagation is based on a stochastic model and pre recorded signal envelope. Multipath propagation is achieved by inducing multiple simulated electromagnetic paths digitally thus producing signal fading and audio distortion.  Detector and Filters Signals are received and converted into audible form by using a product detector mixing the local oscillator signal with the received signal, very similar to Software-defined radio. The digital artifact of the decoded audio signal is later filtered with a 17-order FIR filter with a bandwidth of 2.8 kHz.

A pentalobular screw thread is a form of self-forming thread used for screws. Self-forming screws are used in ductile materials, such as aluminium and plastics. Self-tapping screws are widely used for driving into sheet metal or plastics and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into a pre-pierced hole. Self-drilling screws have some ability to cut a thread, as for a tap. Others work not by cutting, but rather by roll-forming the thread, pushing excess material out of the way by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed. To form a close-fitting thread that will not be loose afterwards, roll-forming requires a lobed tool rather than a constant diameter cylindrical tool. This is particularly the case when the tool and the fastener are the same, such as for a screw. A lobed or polygonal form allows residual compressive stresses from the forming parts of the thread to be relieved in the undercut clearance between the lobes. This lobular thread has other advantages too. It allows the screw to be turned with lower torque, which also increases the 'strip-to-drive ratio' between the torques needed to drive the screw in or to damagingly strip the threads out. The proportions of the lobular thread can also change over the length of the screw, so that the tip of the screw can use greater lobulation to form the thread more aggressively and also provide a centring effect. In conjunction with a thread profile with sharp arrises, a three-lobed thread of this form is the basis of the well-known Taptite screws. The optimum number of lobes is five. Their number should be prime, to avoid the usual harmonic effects between lobes. As is already widely recognised with tapered reamers, five has better stability than three in imperfectly circular holes. More lobes than this, such as seven, would reduce the spacing for clearance between the lobes. A patent has been applied for about a thread with such an optimised pentalobular form. Such thread forms are not a new innovation. A patent for machinery to roll-form the threads of the screws was granted in 1975.

He then worked as a school examiner and at another gymnasium in Stettin and from 1913 to 1935 was head of a school in Bergen auf R√ºgen. After one year teaching the history of Germanic religion at the University of Greifswald, he was appointed Professor of the History of Religion at the University of Leipzig in 1936.According to Horst Junginger, \\"The Study of Religion under the Impact of National Socialism\\", Lecture given at the XVIII Quinquennial Congress of The International Association for the History of Religions, Durban, South Africa (5‚Äì12 August 2000), the faculty chose him as a strong counterbalance to the German Faith Movement. In 1946 he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Theology and was also appointed to an additional position as Professor of Nordic Philology. He also headed the university's Institute for the History of Religion. From 1947 to 1949, he was Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy. He retired in 1955 but from 1955 to 1959 held an emeritus position as \\"commissar\\" of the Institute for the History of Religion and the Old Norse division of the Institute for Germanic Studies. His academic work focussed on ancient Germanic religion, on which he published extensively. Already before World War II, he was known as \\"a critic of romantic excess\\" in interpretations.Bernard Mees, \\"Charisma, Authority and Heil: Walter Baetke and the Chasm of 1945\\", paper presented at Nordic Ideology between Religion and Scholarship, Uppsala 23‚Äì25 August 2010: Summary p. 6 (pdf). In his 1934 Art und Glaube der Germanen, he rejected Herman Wirth's view of the genuineness and importance of the Oera Linda Book and also systematically opposed Bernhard Kummer's views in Midgards Untergang.Fritz Heinrich, \\"Bernhard Kummer (1897-1962): The Study of Religions Between Religious Devotion for the Ancient Germans, Political Agitation, and Academic Habitus\\", The Study of Religion under the Impact of Fascism, ed. Horst Junginger, Numen Book Series (): Studies in the History of Religions 117, Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2008, , p. 233. Also p. 244, note 65, quoting Baetke on Kummer: \\"Nun ist ja klar, da√ü diese 'Vergeistigung' germanischer Religion mit wissenschaftlicher Interpretation nichts mehr zu tun hat.\\" - \\"Now it is quite clear that this 'spiritualisation' of Germanic religion no longer has anything to do with scholarly interpretation\\". In 1942 in Das Heilige im Germanischen, he opposed Rudolf Otto's influential viewpoint that the source of religion lay in a \\"stirring in the heart\\" of awareness of the numinous, arguing that all religious experience has a social and historical context.Gregory D. Alles, ed., Rudolf Otto, Autobiographical and Social Essays, History of Religions in Translation 2, Berlin/New York: Mouton De Gruyter, 1996, , Introduction, p. 34.Todd A. Gooch, The Numinous and Modernity: an Interpretation of Rudolf Otto's Philosophy of Religion, Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 2000, , p. 3. In Yngvi und die Ynglinger (1964) he dismissed the widely accepted view espoused by, for example, Otto H√∂fler that Germanic peoples had sacral kingship.According to Lee M. Hollander's review, he \\"knocks out the props from under\\" it \\"with sober and competent scholarship\\". Speculum 42.3 (1967) 511-513, p. 511. The issue and his arguments are still debated today: in a re- examination in 2004, Olof Sundqvist substantially agreed, finding that \\"this paradigm [sacral kingship] implies a number of methodological difficulties\\";Olof Sundqvist, \\"Aspects of rulership ideology in Early Scandinavia - with particular references to the skaldic poem Ynglingatal\\", Das Fr√ºhmittelalterliche K√∂nigtum: ideelle und religi√∂se Grundlagen, Ed.

Francis Oakley, however, argued in 2010 that although Baetke successfully rebutted the notion that Scandinavian kings were worshipped, he could not dismiss the evidence that they had some sacral status as mediators with the gods.Francis Oakley, Empty Bottles of Gentilism: Kingship and the Divine in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages (to 1050), New Haven: Yale University, 2010, , p. 146. Personal and political Baetke joined the conservative German National People's Party in 1926 and was a member until 1932. From 1934 until the end of the war, he belonged to the National Socialist People's Welfare organisation. However, he never joined the Nazi Party or any of its subsidiaries, including the Reich Author's Organisation, and during the war his election to the examining board of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Leipzig and to the Saxon Academy of Sciences both went unratified by the regime. In 1946 he joined the SPD and subsequently became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the official party of the Soviet Occupation Zone and later of East Germany. He was a member of the Confessing Church and was a delegate to the conference of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam in 1948 from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saxony. Baetke was married twice: in 1911 to Agnes Kirsten (1885-1945) and in 1948 to Erna Knegendorf (1903-2000). Both his wives were teachers.

Life Son of a Quaker pharmacist, Daniel Bell Hanbury (1794-1882), and his wife Rachel Christy (1802-1876), Daniel Hanbury grew up in London. Entering his father's firm, Allen, Hanbury and Barry, at the age of 16, young Daniel quickly proved a valuable and capable employee. His life was dedicated to his work, into which he threw himself with great energy. Hanbury, who never married, was a vegetarian, and like many of his Victorian contemporaries, opposed the use of alcohol and tobacco. He retired from business in 1870 and died in Clapham of typhoid fever. He was buried in the burial ground of the Society of Friends at Wandsworth.Geoffrey Tweedale (2009). Hanbury, Daniel (1825‚Äì1875). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition. doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/12179. Work Hanbury's extensive knowledge of the world's botany was based on years of study, collecting and travel - trips to the Middle East and throughout Europe were supplemented by extensive correspondence with colleagues throughout the world. He was an essential partner to his brother, Sir Thomas Hanbury, in selecting specimens for and establishing the Giardini Botanici Hanbury at La Mortola, now maintained by the University of Genoa. On his death, Sir Thomas donated his brother's entire botanical cabinet collection to Kew Gardens, where it is now part of the Economic Botany Collection. Hanbury's first published contribution, in volume 1 of the Transactions of the Pharmaceutical Society, was published soon after starting his work. It was followed, regularly, by a stream of articles and papers describing the pharmacological applications of various plants, insects, and chemicals, and published in such distinguished sources as the Pharmaceutical Journal and the Transactions of the Linnean Society. During his career he served as President of the British Pharmaceutical Conference, as Botanical Examiner of the Board of Examiners of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (served, 1860-1872; elected member 1857\\"Memoir of Daniel Hanbury\\" published in his Science Papers ...

His collection is housed in the SONS Museum in Kruishouten, Belgium. In 2006 the Guinness Book of World Records2007 Guinness Book of World Records recognized him as having the largest ethnographical shoe collection in the world.  Biography  = William (Boy) Habraken = William (Boy) Habraken was born at the end of World War II in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. At the age of twenty he separated from his father's shoe-business and started his own import/wholesale company in footwear. In 1970 he moved to Taiwan to become one of the first people to export shoes from there and China to Europe. He stood at the base of some of the largest footwear concerns in Europe. Extensive business travel brought him all over the world, visiting over 120 countries. On many of those trips and in his spare time he collected footwear which was part of traditional indigenous clothing. As important as the shoes themselves were to him, was the related information, such as; the materials used, the way of making, the use, the age and the name in the native language.  Collections  Yokohama shoemaker = Ethnographic collection = Starting with his first pair in 1968, he acquired a unique collection of over 3400 pairs of shoes out of about 155 countries, states and territories. There are exceptional specimens of North-American Indians, Arctic Inuit, African tribes, Berber, Bedouin, Mongols, the Ottoman - and the pre-Inca empires. Extensive parts of the collection originate in Japan, India, Iran, Tibet and Pakistan. Europe is represented from Iceland to Russia and from Lapland to Spain. The collection has a broad range of footwear. Examples are Kadaichi shoes made of emu feathers and human hair (used by Australian native executioners). Beautiful bride-shoes from Afghanistan, India, Syria and Turkey. As a native of the Netherlands he of course also collected many wooden shoes. = Designer collection = Next to the ethnographic collection, William Habraken also collected a comprehensive collection of unique pieces of well known shoe designers from around the world. The collection comprises among others rare designs of 20th century designers such as Andr√© Perugia and Salvatore Ferragamo, and from contemporary designers such as Christian Louboutin and Manolo Blahnik.  Works  =Tribal and Ethnic Footwear of the World= His ethnographic collection served as a basis for his influential book Tribal and Ethnic Footwear of The World, which tells stories of footwear around the world. =Did the Gods Wear Shoes?= In his quest to unearth every possible detail of his collection and the history of each pair, he pondered the question of who wore the first pair of shoes. This question resulted in his second book with the title Did the Gods Wear Shoes. = They Who Came Before Us = In the book \\"Did the Gods wear shoes\\" the author explored the possible existence of prior civilizations. In his sequel \\"They who came before us\\" he provides the basis for that possibility. The book focuses on prehistoric mason works around the world. The author uses many detailed pictures along with personal observations to establish an alternative to mainstream historical believes.  Public  = Lectures= He holds lectures on a regular basis, a notable example occurred on March 14, 2016 when he was invited to give a lecture in The British Museum in London titled: \\"A long journey: my footwear collection from the Islamic world\\" = Exposition = In January 2017 he was invited to design the layout for an exhibition titled \\"Human Migration\\" in the peristilium of the Federal Government building in Brussels Belgium. He used shoes of his collection as a symbol to illustrate the road migrants followed in past and presence. This unique exhibition was honored by a visit of Jean- Claude Junker, President of the European Commission. =\\"The Golden Cow\\"= On December 12, 2013 the Schoenen en Lederwaren Soci√´teit de Langstraat (SeLL) (Shoe and Leather Society Langstraat) announced that Mr. Habraken was the winner of The Golden Cow.

Most workers want to know how they are doing on the job. Workers need performance feedback to work effectively. Accessing an employee timely, accurate, constructive feedback is key to effective performance. Motivational strategies such as goal setting depend upon regular performance updates. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and through the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales. In industrial and organizational psychology such scales are used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance. There are several methods of performance rating. The simplest and most common method is based on speed or pace. Dexterity and effectiveness are also important considerations when assessing performance. Standard performance is denoted as 100.Kanawaty, George, ed. Introduction to Work Study. 4th ed. Geneva, Switzerland: International Labor Office, 1992. A performance rating greater than 100 means the worker's performance is more than standard, and less than 100 means the worker's performance is less than standard. It is important to note that standard performance is not necessarily the performance level expected of workers, the term standard can be misleading. For example, a standard performance rating of a worker walking is 4.5 miles/hour. The ratings is used in conjunction with a timing study to level out actual time (observed time) taken by the worker under observation. This leads to a basic minute value (observed time/100*rating). This balances out fast and slow workers to get to a standard/average time. Standard at a 100 is not a percentage, it simply makes the calculations easier. Most companies that set targets using work study methods will set it at a level of around 85, not 100. Attributions to work performance Performance rating has become a continuous process by which an employer and employees attempt to understand company goals and how his or her progress toward contributing to them are measured. Performance measurement is an ongoing activity for all managers and their subordinates. A performance measurement uses the following indicators: * Quantity: addresses how much work is produced. A quantity measure can be expressed as an error rate, such as number one percentage of errors allowable per unit of work, or as a general result to be achieved. * Quality: address how well the work is performed and/or how accurate or how effective the final product is. * Timeliness: addresses how quickly, when or by what date the work is produced. The most common error made in setting timeliness standards is to allow no margin for error. As with other standards, timeliness standards should be set realistically in view of other performance requirements and needs of the organization. * Cost-effectiveness: addresses dollar savings to the organization or working within a budget. Standards that address cost- effectiveness should be based on specific resource levels (money, personnel, or time) that generally can be documented and measured in agencies' annual fiscal year budgets. Cost-effectiveness standards may include such aspects of performance as maintaining or reducing unit costs, reducing the time it takes to produce a product or service, or reducing waste. * Absenteeism/tardiness: addresses the ability for employee to show up at work and on time. How it is affecting their work performance and other employees. * Adherence to policy: addresses deviation from policy and performance goals. * Professional appearance: addresses how well employees conduct themselves in the work place and comply with dress code/working environment. Effectiveness of performance rating The purpose of performance rating is to provide systematic evaluation of the employees‚Äô contribution to the organization. Globally, the combination of indicators and performance management, combined with intensifying work, transforms the work of employees and of the managers. On the managerial level, the will of hierarchy to fulfill performance indicators is dependent on task prioritizing, which is not shared amongst everyone. Performance Rating intensifies the environment of the organization but provides structure for production. Performance satisfaction is found to be directly related to both affective commitment and intention of employee. If motivated more likely to meet goals.

It is best known for its air resistance indoor rowing machines (a.k.a. \\"ergometers\\" or \\"ergs\\"), which are considered the standard training and testing machines for competition rowers and can be found in most gyms. Competitive events rowed on a Concept2 rower include: the CRASH-B Sprints (which style themselves the world championship for indoor rowing); the British Indoor Rowing Championships indoor rowing competitions; and the CrossFit Games events (including the CrossFit Open and qualifiers). Concept2 also manufactures oars for sculling and sweep rowing (under the name Dreissigacker) and air resistance Nordic skiing trainers (SkiErgs). A row of Concept2 \\"Model C\\" indoor rowers  History  The company was founded in 1976 by rowing brothers Dick and Pete Dreissigacker. The two brothers trialed for the American team for the 1976 Summer Olympics and while preparing, they modified their oars with carbon fiber in an attempt to go faster. When they were not selected for the team, they founded the company and started selling carbon fiber oars. Their first office was in the back of a bread truck until they bought a farm in Morrisville, Vermont, United States.  Oars  Dreissigacker oars were well received by the rowing community and quickly established themselves as one of the major players in the market. In 1991, the company came out with asymmetrical \\"hatchet\\" oar blades. These improved a team's performance by 1 or 2% and became popular so quickly that by 1992 most of the Olympic crews were using them. Many elite rowers use Concept2 oars, and along with Croker oars they make up the majority of oars used in international competition.  Indoor rower (erg)  Old Model A version Concept2 equipment at the headquarters gym area. In 1981, the brothers had the idea of making an indoor rowing machine (the Model A) made mainly from bicycle parts. It had a moving seat and a flywheel which used air for resistance. At the time the indoor machines on the market cost $3,000 but the brothers (with help from friend Jon Williams) sold theirs for $600. The product was an instant success and has been revised over the years with the Model B (1986), Model C (1993), Model D (2003), Model E (2006) and Dynamic (2010). Until 2006 the company produced and sold only one model of indoor rower at any time. That changed in September 2006, when Concept2 upgraded their Model D and began selling a new prosumer-oriented Model E (priced around $400/¬£300 above Model D) that provides a higher rowing position with extra layers of paint/varnish, shipped with a more advanced (\\"PM4\\") monitor and bundled an ANT+HR-compatible Garmin heart rate belt. Both D & E models are used for indoor rowing events such as BIRC and CRASH-B. In 2018, CrossFit officially made Concept2's D & E models as the official spec rowers for The CrossFit Open and Games following an investigation discovered rival manufacturer Xebex was \\"significantly easier than the competition standard,\\" resulting in an official declaration that the Concept2 was the specification manufacturer. In 2010, they introduced the Dynamic indoor rower, which has a moving foot stretcher instead of a moving seat. This results in less body mass movement compared to the prior indoor rower models and simulates on water rowing more closely. Early model performance monitor, model PM1. The PM1 was available from 1986-1995. The most current electronic monitor for feedback on the indoor rowers as of September 2014 is the Performance Monitor 5 or \\"PM5\\". The friction-prone areas like chain are coated with nickel for the longevity of the parts. Nickel coating also assists in lubrication and maintenance. The indoor rower's nickname comes from its measurement of the power output of oarsmen/women. As such it is a class of ergometer (Greek: measuring work), and competitive rowers rarely refer to the machine as an \\"indoor rower,\\" but use the older name \\"erg\\" or \\"ergo\\" (short for ergometer).  SkiErg  In June 2009, Concept2 introduced their newest product, the SkiErg. The SkiErg is a ski ergometer that helps build strength and endurance specific to Nordic skiing. The SkiErg uses the same mechanical concept that the company's indoor rowers do, but the user is in a standing position pulling on two handles emulating the double-pole technique found in Nordic skiing. Each pull engages the arms, shoulders, core, and legs in a downwards \\"crunch\\" making it a total body workout. It places greater physical demands on the triceps, chest, and abdominal muscles, in addition to the strong engagement of the back muscles that both exercises share. DYNO The Concept2 DYNO was an air resistance strength training machine sold by Concept2 from 2001 until 2007. It was designed for bench press, leg press, and seated row exercises and used a flywheel to provide resistance.  BikeErg  The Concept2 BikeErg is a stationary bike that was introduced in 2017. It uses a flywheel similar to the one found on Concept2's indoor rower and SkiErg.  Online logbook and world rankings Starting 1999, the company began facilitating a community of home-based rowers who maintain online logs hosted on the Concept2 website. Their performances are ranked in real time on the Concept2 website. The total number of meters logged in the 2014 season (May 1, 2013 ‚Äì April 30, 2014) exceeded 10.2 billion, by over 47,000 users. There are hundreds of clubs that rowers may affiliate with when registering with the ranking system. Meters can be logged on the indoor rower, on water, on the SkiErg or on snow. Concept2 also hosts year-round online challenges aimed at motivating rowers. Online Challenges Concept2 organizes a number of challenges throughout the year. Many of these reward consistency and total meters instead of speed, giving an extra incentive to work out regularly. =Virtual Team Challenge= The Virtual Team Challenge (VTC), runs every year from January 1‚Äì31. Each team completes as many meters as they can collectively between 12:00 a.m. January 1 and 11:59 p.m. January 31. Virtual teams (not based on or around a specific physical location) can be made up of anyone from anywhere who wants to participate‚Äîfriends, family, co- workers, old schoolmates, rowing teammates, and so on. Teams can also be real \\"clubs\\" with a physical location. Participants are only allowed to record meters from the Indoor Rower the SkiErg. Greenwich Crew from Cos Cob, CT currently holds the title of the Virtual Team Challenge, winning for three consecutive years in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Doerflinger was appointed by then Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin on January 19, 2011. Prior to his appointment, Doerflinger served as the city auditor for Tulsa, Oklahoma from 2009 until this appointment as secretary. Shortly thereafter he was also named the Director of the newly created Office of Management and Enterprise Systems. In his role as Secretary of Finance he was the Governor‚Äôs lead budget executive and negotiator. He was appointed by the governor as the Interim Commissioner of Health in October, 2017 while maintaining his roles as Cabinet Secretary and Director of the Office of Management and Enterprise Systems. He resigned from all of his roles in Oklahoma State government in February 2018. Biography Doerflinger was raised in Oologah, Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor's degree in organizational leadership from Southern Nazarene University. Doerflinger was the Republican nominee for City Auditor for Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was elected in 2009 to a two-year term. As city auditor, he oversaw the City's Management Review Office and was tasked with the implementation of government service improvements. On January 19, 2011, Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin announced that she had selected Doerflinger to serve as her Oklahoma Secretary of Finance and Revenue. The Governor also announced that she would appointment him to a concurrent term as the Director of the Oklahoma Office of State Finance, later consolidated with several state agencies to create the Office of Management and Enterprise Services. As Secretary, Doerflinger was responsible for preparing and implementing the Governor's budget as well as overseeing the Governor's fiscal policies. Doerflinger was also the Governor‚Äôs lead budget negotiator and received much acknowledgment and acclaim for his streamlined, fiscally efficient results as to both the state budget and the state agencies he directed. Doerflinger‚Äôs management and policies at the Office of Management and Enterprise Services led to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings of taxpayer dollars due to his consolidation of redundant functions, ability to attract and retain high quality professionals, and implementation of numerous technology Initiatives. In October 2017, Doerflinger was named the Interim Commissioner of Health by Governor Mary Fallin after the previous Commissioner resigned amid allegations of financial and operational mismanagement. During his short tenure as Interim Commissioner of Health Doerflinger was credited with multiple advancements including a realignment of agency resources to better serve the public and public health, cancellation of many over-priced and illegal contracting schemes, and transforming the agency‚Äôs 1,800 employees to a transparent and empowered work force. On February 13, 2018, Doerflinger resigned from state government after an article about an incident six years prior was published by Dylan Goforth with The Frontier. The article was in reference to 2012 Tulsa Police call logs, which included a 911 call relating to domestic abuse, which his ex-wife later recanted. The call log and 911 call were long known to the Governor and most in state government. The article by The Frontier was not published until over six years after the incident, leading many to believe it was an orchestrated hit piece tipped off by a political foe of Doerflinger‚Äôs who resented his streamlined and efficient approach to government administration. It has further been speculated that The Frontier was pressured to publish the article due to it being a widely unknown publication criticized for having a strong political bias. After Doerflinger‚Äôs resignation from Oklahoma state government, he continued development of his successful business enterprises, which includes partnerships with Oklahoma Native American tribes and numerous Fortune 500 companies. Personal life Doerflinger has one son and was married to Jill Doerflinger until 2013.

He was excluded from office during the Interregnum, but became one of the most senior Irish judges after the Restoration of Charles II. Biography Bysse was born around 1602, the eldest son of Christopher Bysse, who died before 1615. Christopher was an official of the Exchequer, as was his own father, Robert Bysse. John's mother was Margaret Forster, daughter of John Forster, an alderman of Dublin. Bysse was admitted as a member of the King's Inns in 1632. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Charlemont in 1634 and became Recorder of Dublin in the same year. He was re-elected to the Commons in 1640. At the outbreak of Irish Rebellion of 1641 John Bysse, along with his younger brother Robert (who was Recorder of Drogheda) were among the leaders of the royalist and Protestant faction in Parliament. This faction opposed the royalist Catholic faction, but were allied with it from 1649 to oppose the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. During the Commonwealth he remained Recorder of Dublin, he was twice recommended for appointment to the High Court Bench and was elected to Parliament, but excluded from taking his seat. At the Restoration he was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and held that office until his death. In addition to serving on the Bench, he attended regularly at the Irish House of Lords, acting as a legal adviser to the Lords. He is buried in St. Audoen's Church, Dublin. Bysse became a substantial landowner, inheriting Preston's Inn, on the site of the present City Hall, Dublin, where he built a large mansion (which was demolished in the 1760s), and also Brackenstown near Swords, which had been bought by his father around 1611. Later he was granted part of the freehold of Philipstown (now Daingean), County Offaly. Personality and reputation Elrington Ball remarks flippantly that Bysse had a kind of \\"hereditary claim\\" on the Exchequer as both his father and grandfather had been officials there. In fact the author makes it clear that Bysse was eminently qualified to be Chief Baron: he had been Recorder of Dublin for 25 years and had sat in two Parliaments; he was hard-working, conscientious and popular with all political factions. In religion he seems to have been tolerant by the standards of the time, causing something of a stir in 1665 when he acted as mourner at the funeral of a nonconformist clergyman. Despite Bysse's undoubted good qualities, within a few years of his appointment as Chief Baron serious complaints were being made about his slowness and incompetence; he was even accused of senility. These complaints were taken seriously and in 1669 and 1671 he was threatened with removal from office. He was fortunate in enjoying the friendship of the Lord Lieutenant, James, Duke of Ormonde, to whom loyalty was a cardinal virtue: as Ball remarks \\"those whom he ever loved, he loved to the end\\". Ormonde strongly defended Bysse, admitting he was slow in giving judgement but arguing that his integrity and capacity for hard work compensated for this, and he denied that there had been any fall-off in Bysse's mental abilities. These arguments were presumably successful since he was not removed from office. In his last years there were persistent rumours that he would either resign or be dismissed, but in fact he remained Chief Baron until his death in 1680, aged about seventy-eight. Family John Bysse married Margaret Edgeworth (died 1676) daughter of Francis Edgeworth of County Longford, who held office as Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper from 1606 to c.1620. Francis was the brother and heir of Edward Edgeworth (died 1595), Bishop of Down and Connor, and ancestor of the celebrated novelist Maria Edgeworth. Margaret was the widow of John King (brother of Sir Robert King and uncle of Sir Robert King, 1st Baronet ) who was Clerk of the Crown jointly with his father-in-law.

In addition to producing a red grand vin named Ch√¢teau les Carmes Haut-Brion, the estate produces the red second wine Le C des Carmes. History In 1584, Jean de Pontac Lord of Haut- Brion donated a windmill on the banks of the Peugue river, surrounded by vines and adjoining outbuildings, to the Roman Catholic Grand Carmelite Order in Bordeaux. In 1630, the Grand Carmelite Order expanded the estate by purchasing vines located in the ‚Äòaubrion‚Äô area. The Carmelites owned the estate for two hundred years and retained the ‚ÄòHaut-Brion‚Äô name, which gradually became ‚ÄòCarmes Haut-Brion‚Äô. The estate became a national asset in 1791 when Church holdings were seized during the French Revolution. Wine merchant L√©on Colin then purchased it in 1840 and renamed it Carmes-Haut-Brion. He subsequently passed the estate down to his descendants, the Chantecaille family, who built the current chateau at the beginning of the 19th century, as well as creating the park designed by landscape architect Louis-Bernard Fisher (who notably designed the Jardin Public gardens in Bordeaux). This estate remained in the family until 2010. = Patrice Pichet and Ch√¢teau les Carmes Haut-Brion = Patrice Pichet, the head of France's family-run real estate group, acquired the estate at the end of 2010. As a great wine enthusiast and collector, Patrice Pichet sought to turn this unique ten-hectare estate into a genuine jewel set in the city of Bordeaux. To achieve this, he has surrounded himself with top professionals ‚Äì Guillaume Pouthier, the director of operations, and St√©phane Derenoncourt, who has been the estate's consultant for several years ‚Äì and made all the right choices regarding vine monitoring, vineyard expansion and winemaking. The initial purchase was followed by the acquisition of complementary plots, in particular 17 hectares in a single stretch, bringing the estate to its current size of 35 hectares. Unique and ambitious new facilities were created to support this momentum. New winery and reception areas designed and created by Philippe Starck and Luc Ars√®ne-Henry were inaugurated in 2016, marking the resolutely iconic intentions of this new chapter beginning at Carmes Haut-Brion. The vineyard = The historic vineyard = Ch√¢teau les Carmes Haut-Brion is the only Bordeaux chateau to be actually in Bordeaux, at the unique address of 20, Rue des Carmes. Although the vineyard was historically ‚Äòoutside the walls‚Äô, it is now entirely within the city, a walled vineyard in urban surroundings. The exceptional location of the estate, ten hectares in size including six hectares of vineyards, means that it enjoys a privileged environment with a milder microclimate and a well- preserved ecosystem that work together to ensure perfectly ripe grapes. The terroir, a mixture of Mindel gravel, sand, and clay over a limestone subsoil, forms a unique geological spectrum that has informed this vineyard's unusual mix of grape varieties, consisting of 40% Cabernet Franc, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and the remainder Merlot. The vines are an average of 42 years old and are planted with a density of 10,000 per hectare. This singular location and unique mix of grape varieties give Carmes Haut-Brion a strong identity as an exceptional vineyard. = The modern vineyard = The estate has expanded to incorporate complementary plots in the villages of Martillac, Cadaujac and Saint M√©dard D‚ÄôEyrans, that have been purchased progressively since 2011, bringing the total area today to 35 hectares. These plots are used to produce the estate's other signature wine, Le C des Carmes Haut-Brion, and have their own modern production facility in the village of Martillac. The vineyards are planted with 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot and are now 13 years old on average. They grow in a terroir consisting of Gunz gravel, sand and clay.  Winemaking  = Wine making = The winemaking process is sustainable and draws on traditional methods. Since 2009, the soils have been worked completely organically (using only natural products) with the greatest respect for the site. Harvesting is by hand and tractors are gradually being replaced by horses. Since 2012, winemaking has used whole grapes with a small portion of the stems and been carried out in vats of 21 to 86 hectolitres in size. The top wine is matured in oak barrels (75% new oak), large casks and terracotta amphoras for a period of 18 to 24 months. Le C des Carmes Haut- Brion is matured in 30% new oak barrels for 12 to 18 months, and then in cement vats. = Equipment = When Patrice Pichet acquired the estate, he considered it essential to install new equipment in keeping with the high quality ambitions of this prestigious vineyard. For this project he commissioned designer Philippe Starck and architect Luc Ars√®ne-Henry to design and create an architectural ensemble that prioritises technical efficiency. The winery, which welcomed its first harvests in 2015 and was inaugurated in June 2016, covers an area of around 2,000 m2 and has four separate floors to house reception and technical activities. The maturing cellar on the first floor can hold 300 barrels, which are kept beneath a body of water to provide a naturally tailored temperature and hygrometry. On the second floor, a 200 m2 area is set aside for receiving harvests and communicates directly with a 1,200-hectolitre vat house that operates by natural gravity. The vats are a variety of sizes and alternate between three different materials: wood, stainless steel and concrete. The two uppermost floors of the winery are devoted to tasting and to welcoming customers. To differentiate it from the chateau's other signature wine, Patrice Pichet decided to give Le C des Carmes Haut-Brion its own modern, high-performance production facility in the village of Martillac.

Background Henry St John, Lord Bolingbroke, Jacobite Secretary of State in 1715 The 1688 Glorious Revolution deposed James II and VII and replaced him with his Protestant daughter Mary II and her Dutch husband William III and II, ruling as joint monarchs. Since neither Mary nor her sister Anne had surviving children, the 1701 Act of Settlement ensured a Protestant successor by excluding Catholics from the English and Irish thrones, and that of Great Britain after the 1707 Act of Union. When Anne became the last Stuart monarch in 1702, her heir was the distantly related but Protestant Sophia of Hanover, not her Catholic half-brother James Francis Edward. Sophia died two months before Anne in August 1714; her son became George I and the pro-Hanoverian Whigs controlled government for the next 30 years. French support had been crucial for the Stuart exiles, but their acceptance of the Protestant succession in Britain was part of the terms that ended the 1701-1714 War of the Spanish Succession. This ensured a smooth inheritance by George I in August 1714, and the Stuarts were later banished from France by the terms of 1716 Anglo-French Treaty. The 1710‚Äì1714 Tory government had actively prosecuted their Whig opponents, who now retaliated, accusing the Tories of corruption: Robert Harley was imprisoned in the Tower of London while Lord Bolingbroke escaped to France and became James' new Secretary of State. On 14 March 1715, James appealed to Pope Clement XI for help with a Jacobite rising: \\"It is not so much a devoted son, oppressed by the injustices of his enemies, as a persecuted Church threatened with destruction, which appeals for the protection and help of its worthy pontiff\\".Michael, p. 134. On 19 August, Bolingbroke wrote to James that \\"..things are hastening to that point, that either you, Sir, at the head of the Tories, must save the Church and Constitution of England or both must be irretrievably lost for ever\\". Believing the great general Marlborough would join him, on 23 August James wrote to the Duke of Berwick, his illegitimate brother and Marlborough's nephew, that; \\"I think it is now more than ever Now or Never\\".Michael, p. 152. Raising the standard John Erskine, Earl of Mar. Despite receiving no commission from James to start the rising, the Earl of Mar sailed from London to Scotland and on 27 August at Braemar in Aberdeenshire held the first council of war. On 6 September at Braemar, Mar raised the standard of \\"James the 8th and 3rd\\", acclaimed by 600 supporters.Christoph v. Ehrenstein, 'Erskine, John, styled twenty-second or sixth earl of Mar and Jacobite duke of Mar (bap. 1675, d. 1732)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 20 January 2011. Parliament responded with the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1715, and passed an Act that confiscated the land of rebelling Jacobite landlords in favour of their tenants who supported the London government. Some of Mar's tenants travelled to Edinburgh to prove their loyalty to the Hanoverian crown and acquire title to Mar's land.Michael, p. 156. Struggle for Scotland In northern Scotland, the Jacobites were successful. They took Inverness, Gordon Castle, Aberdeen and further south, Dundee, although they were unable to capture Fort William.Michael, p. 158. In Edinburgh Castle, the government stored arms for up to 10,000 men and ¬£100,000 paid to Scotland when she entered the Union with England. Lord Drummond, with 80 Jacobites, tried under the cover of night to take the Castle, but the Governor of the Castle learnt of their plans and successfully defended it. By October, Mar's force, numbering nearly 20,000, had taken control of all Scotland above the Firth of Forth, apart from Stirling Castle. However, Mar was indecisive, and the Jacobite capture of Perth and the move south by 2,000 men were probably at the initiative of subordinates. Mar's hesitation gave the Hanoverian commander, the Duke of Argyll, time to increase his strength with reinforcements from the Irish Garrison.Reid p.19-20 On 22 October, Mar received his commission from James appointing him commander of the Jacobite army. His forces outnumbered Argyll's Hanoverian army by three-to-one, and Mar decided to march on Stirling Castle. On 13 November at Sheriffmuir, the two forces joined battle. The fighting was indecisive, but near the end, the Jacobites numbered 4,000 to Argyll's 1,000. Mar's force began to advance on Argyll, who was poorly protected, but Mar did not close in, possibly believing that he had won the battle already (Argyll had lost 660 men, three times as many as Mar). Instead, Mar retreated to Perth. On the same day as the Battle of Sheriffmuir, Inverness surrendered to Hanoverian forces, and a smaller Jacobite force led by Mackintosh of Borlum was defeated at Preston.

The government arrested the leaders, including Sir William Wyndham, on the night of 2 October, and on the following day easily obtained Parliament's legitimation of these arrests.Michael, pp. 163‚Äì164. The government sent reinforcements to defend Bristol, Southampton and Plymouth.Michael, p. 164. Oxford, famous for its monarchist sentiment, fell under government suspicion, and on 17 October General Pepper led the dragoons into the city and arrested some leading Jacobites without resistance.Michael, p. 165. Though the main rising in the West had been forestalled, a planned secondary rising in Northumberland went ahead on 6 October 1715, including two peers of the realm, James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, and William Widdrington, 4th Baron Widdrington, and a future peer, Charles Radclyffe, later de jure 5th Earl of Derwentwater. Another future English peer, Edward Howard, later 9th Duke of Norfolk, joined the rising later in Lancashire, as did other prominent figures, including Robert Cotton, one of the leading gentlemen in Huntingdonshire. The English Jacobites joined with a force of Scottish Borderer Jacobites, led by William Gordon, 6th Viscount Kenmure, and this small army received Mackintosh's contingent. They marched into England, where the Government forces caught up with them at the Battle of Preston on 12‚Äì14 November. The Jacobites won the first day of the battle, killing large numbers of Government forces, but Government reinforcements arrived the next day and the Jacobites eventually surrendered. Aftermath Broadside image: the Pretender, Prince James, Landing at Peterhead on 22 December 1715 On 22 December James landed in Scotland at Peterhead,James Panton, Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy (2011), p. xxxiv but by the time he arrived at Perth on 9 January 1716, the Jacobite army numbered fewer than 5,000. In contrast, Argyll's forces had acquired heavy artillery and were advancing quickly. Mar decided to burn a number of villages between Perth and Stirling to deprive Argyll's army of supplies. On 30 January Mar led the Jacobites out of Perth; on 4 February James wrote a farewell letter to Scotland, sailing from Montrose the following day. Many Jacobites prisoners were tried for treason and sentenced to death. On 14 May 1716 Henry Oxburgh was hung, drawn and quartered at Tyburn. The Indemnity Act of July 1717 pardoned all those who had taken part in the Rising, but the whole of Clan Gregor, including Rob Roy MacGregor, was specifically excluded from the benefits of that Act.Peter Hume Brown, A History of Scotland to the Present Time, p. 154 In later years, James, now known as the Old Pretender, made two more attempts at the British throne. In 1719, despite Spanish support, he was again defeated in the Battle of Glenshiel. James's son Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, attempted to win the throne for his father in 1745, but was defeated at the Battle of Culloden. James died in 1766.

From 1749 to 1778 it was the house of Charles Wesley, hymn writer and co-founder of Methodism, and his wife Sarah Wesley n√©e Gwynne. It was Charles Wesley's main residence during 1756‚Äì71. It was the childhood home of his sons Charles Wesley junior and Samuel Wesley. They were musical child prodigies, who both became renowned organists and composers. The house's interior has been restored to its 18th century appearance, with period fittings. Wesley family Charles Wesley (1707‚Äì1788), and his wife, Sarah Gwynne (1726‚Äì1822) from Brecknockshire, moved into the house in September 1749, after their marriage earlier that year. Initially, Charles continued his \\"itinerations\\", that is travelling and preaching around the country, and so was often away from home. Sarah sometimes accompanied him. By 1756 this lifestyle had taken its toll on his health, and after that year he made no further long journeys to distant parts of the country. However, he still spent much of his time away in London, attending to the Methodist community there. He was the Methodist \\"minister in residence\\" for Bristol, and was described in the St James's Church parish records as a \\"preacher at the Horsefair\\". Charles and Sarah had many children, all baptised at St James's. In between Charles junior (1757‚Äì1834) and Samuel (1766‚Äì1837) they had a daughter, Sarah (1759‚Äì1828), who like her mother was often called Sally. There were other children, but they died young, and were buried in St James's churchyard. Child prodigies The early musical education of Charles junior and Samuel mostly took place in the family home. The boys' earliest musical influence was their mother, who had a good singing voice and played the harpsichord. Hymn tunes and the works of Handel were the family's favourite pieces. The first music teachers for the two prodigies were both local church organists. From around the age of six, Charles junior had lessons from Edmund Rooke, who was organist at All Saints' Church from 1759 and at Bristol Cathedral during 1769‚Äì73. From a similar age, Samuel had lessons from David Williams, who was the organist at All Saints' Church from 1772. Charles junior's public performances in Bristol included a 1769 harpsichord concerto at the Assembly Room, and an Easter 1774 organ concerto in Bristol Cathedral. On that occasion Samuel was aggrieved as he had expected to be the one giving the performance. From 1771 onwards the family had two households, the other being in Chesterfield Street, Marylebone, London. Charles and Charles junior moved to the London house that year, and the whole family had moved to London by 1778. The London house was demolished in the mid 19th century. Architecture The two attached houses at 4 and 5 Charles Street have been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. It is early 18th century, early Georgian in style, and built of brick with three stories. At the front each house has two sash windows per floor, with stepped voussoirs over the windows. The houses are surrounded by modern buildings.

The band received positive reviews in the Washington Post and the New York Times, among others. Urban Verbs became darlings of the DC downtown art scene and played shows at such arty venues as the Washington Project for the Arts, d.c. space, the Corcoran Gallery and School of Art, and the Pension Building (now the National Building Museum). Warner Brothers executive Bob Krasnow signed the band to a two-record contract.

In November 1970, GM paid $50 million for initial licenses to produce their version of the Wankel rotary engine, and GM President Ed Cole initially projected its release in three years. Chevrolet, with impetus from Pete Estes and John DeLorean, as well as Ed Cole worked on the Wankel. Bob Templin was the chief executive in charge of rotary-engine research at the GM Tech Center in Warren, Michigan, but Ed Cole would leave his office in Detroit twice a week for the trip to Warren, taking charge of the program.Automotive News Article date:May 21, 2001 The engine was initially targeted for an October 1973 introduction as a 1974 Chevrolet Vega option. Its mediocre fuel economy and the ill-timed Arab oil embargo were contributing factors to end the GM rotary program. History of Development 1972 GM Rotary engine cutaway shows twin-rotors Popular Science magazine in the May 1972 article \\"GM Rotary Engine for the 1974 Vega\\", an illustration of the Wankel installed in a 1974 Vega hatchback showed a different grille, a lower, more sloped hood line, and a \\"GM Rotary\\" badge and Wankel crest on the rear quarter panel. They stated the Vega-rotary would be sold as a package with performance items, including mag-styled wheels, radial tires, and rally stripes.Popular Science-May 1974 The Wankel had so far proven more reliable than four, six, and eight-cylinder engines ‚Äì GM-rotary engines were run up to showing only minimal wear, and the engine's fewer moving parts assured its reliability.Popular Science May 1972 p. 100 The final design General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine (GMRCE) was fixed when responsibility for the power plant's manufacture was turned over to General Motors Hydra Matic Division in August 1972 ‚Äì two rotors displacing , twin distributors and coils, and a switch to aluminum housing construction. Iron couldn't match the heat- dissipating qualities of aluminum. In addition, there was also a rotor tip- seal problem in the cast-iron configuration, especially after .Motor Trend- July 1973 p.52 RC2-206 Wankels were installed in 1973 Vegas for cold weather testing performed in Canada. =Fuel economy vs reliability and meeting emissions= 1974 Vega RC2-206 Wankel Early in 1973, progress on the generation I Wankel engine had progressed to the point where GM felt it had a good chance to meet '75 emissions standards. To meet those standards GM had to scrap the design theory of widely spaced dual spark plugs and move them closer to the rotor chamber, Mazda fashion. That helped lower emissions but did not improve fuel economy, and GM was unwilling to face gas mileage criticism that Mazda withstood. In April 1973, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relaxed emission standards for '75, and GM tuned the engine to provide better mileage at a sacrifice to exhaust emissions by reverting to the earlier layout. Other refinements improved mileage to a remarkable , according to GM, but with the fuel breakthrough came related side-effect problems. Durability under the \\"hot\\" set-up began to deteriorate. Higher temperatures and pressures affected both apex seals and the chrome-on-steel-on-aluminum coating of the trochoid surface. The surface plating tended to crack and flake away around the exhaust port, blamed by GM engineers on sudden cooling after hard, hot running. Motor Trend magazine, in the July 1973 article \\"The '75 Vega Rotary\\" quoted: \\"GM saw the rotary engine's future as probably much greater than they do today...mileage will be in the range. Compared to the normal piston (engine) Vega's , the whole rotary deal begins to look just a little less attractive, with what the price of gasoline skyrocketing, but that's another matter.\\"quote-Motor Trend-July 1973-p.52 By November, 1973 the side-effect troubles were intense. No immediate solutions were being revealed by engineers working all but around the clock, their backs to the two walls of production tooling requirements and the need to freeze a design to begin emission certification. Ed Cole and his top engineer Frank Winchell, had taken personal charge of the project and had stopped work on all other GM-rotaries to focus on the problems of the Vega RC2-206 Wankel. A month later it was clear the Wankel would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time for the start of the 1975 model year. A new model had now been planned to showcase the engine; The 1975 Vega-based Monza 2+2.Motor Trend, Mar. 1975, v. 29, n. 3, pg. 53 On December 21, 1973 when GM paid another $10 million against its rotary licence fees, the company announced the first postponement.Motor Trend, International report, p.24-April 1974 Motor Trend in April 1974 predicted the outcome: \\"If the GM rotary engine hasn't made a place for itself in the company's lineup by fall, and if by then it hasn't been locked into the '75 model range - somewhere - the odds will increase that it may never go into production.\\" =End of rotary program= The Wankel cycle On September 24, 1974, Ed Cole postponed the Wankel engine, ostensibly due to emissions difficulties. He retired the same month. The rotary's emissions problem was mentioned with no specifics. GM admitted fuel economy for the rotary was sub- standard and postponed production in favor of further development. Pete Estes succeeded Ed Cole as GM President and never showed any special interest in the Wankel or in the perpetuation of Cole's ideas.Estes had previously decided to let the Corvair expire, another Cole project -- well before the celebrated attacks of Ralph Nader. Motor Trend, April 1974 As General Motors managers were cancelling the Wankel project, the R&D; team partly released the results of their most recent research, which claimed to have solved the fuel economy problem, and reliable engines with a lifespan above 530,000 miles. These findings were not taken into account when the cancellation order was issued. The General Motors' abandonment of the rotary engine affected American Motors, who had an agreement to purchase power rotary plants from General Motors. The 1975 AMC Pacer was designed to utilize GM's new rotary engine, however AMC was forced to market the car with an inline six engine. =Rotary vs GM V8 engine= Wankel vs. V8 engine *Weight: Wankel - / V8 - *Number of parts: Wankel - 698 / V8 - 1,103 *Moving parts: Wankel - 154 / V8 - 388 *Space requirement: Wankel - / V8 - *Net power @ rpm: Wankel - @ 6,000 / V8 - @ 4,000 *Net torque @ rpm: Wankel - @ 4,000 / V8 - @ 2,400 *Hp per lb / kW/kg.: Wankel - / V8 See also *Wankel engine References External links How Wankel Engines Work Category:General Motors engines Category:Wankel engines ","title":"General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine"},{"id":"30550439","text":"Love Theme from \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (A Time for Us) is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released on July 30, 1969, by Columbia Records.

It contains an indoor concert hall and an outdoor amphitheatre. It is the second indoor/outdoor concert venue in America. Modeled after its predecessor, Express Live! in Columbus, the venue features state-of-the-art lighting, acoustical systems and an innovative reversible stage. Structurally, it's divided into three independent concert spaces: a music hall, club and outdoor amphitheater. History The complex sits adjacent to the Pittsburgh Steelers' Heinz Field. The team, which held the rights to develop the land adjacent to the stadium (the site of the Steelers former home, Three Rivers Stadium), partially owns the venue along with Continental Real Estate Cos. of Columbus, Ohio. The cost of construction was $12 million, with $2.5 million funded from state taxes. Total space of the indoor venue is 22,000 square feet, while the outdoor lawns totals 30,000 square feet. When it opened, the complex was expected to host approximately 100 events per year. In June 2010, naming rights were granted to American Eagle Outfitters, a clothing retailer based in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood. The venue opened in early December 2010 with two performances by Pittsburgh-native musician Girl Talk. Other performances in the first month included Cake and Anberlin, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, and Pittsburgh-natives Wiz Khalifa and The Clarks. During the week before the 2011 NHL Winter Classic held at Heinz Field between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals, the outdoor lawn of the venue held a skating rink that was open to the public. Leading up to the Steelers' hosting the 2011 AFC Championship game against the New York Jets, the venue hosted several concerts, parties, and rallies.

WWE, which normally runs its shows at the PPG Paints Arena for the main roster when visiting Pittsburgh, uses the venue for live events for its NXT developmental brand while leaving PPG Paints Arena as a future option for NXT TakeOver events. Ring of Honor has adopted Stage AE as its de facto home in Pittsburgh after previously using various venues in and around the area, including the David L. Lawrence Convention Center across the Allegheny River from the venue and as far away as Belle Vernon, California, Indiana, and Wheeling for shows, using college venues or (in Wheeling's case) WesBanco Arena for shows. ROH has had both live events and tapings for Ring of Honor Wrestling at Stage AE, including the Global Wars 2017 tour with New Japan Pro- Wrestling. (The latter marking NJPW's debut in Pittsburgh.) Local Fox affiliate WPGH-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WPNT, who are both owned by ROH parent Sinclair Broadcast Group and the latter the local home of Ring of Honor Wrestling, often serve as a sponsor for ROH at the venue.

Though used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, this method of identification is still in development and has not yet been universally adopted by crime labs as it is not considered as reliable as more established techniques, such as fingerprinting. However, it can be used in conjunction with existing forensic data in support of a conclusion. While other types of biometric scanners are more popular for security systems, vascular scanners are growing in popularity. Fingerprint scanners are more frequently used, but they generally do not provide enough data points for critical verification decisions. Since fingerprint scanners require direct contact of the finger with the scanner, dry or abraded skin can interfere with the reliability of the system. Skin diseases, such as psoriasis, can also limit the accuracy of the scanner, not to mention direct contact with the scanner can result in need for more frequent cleaning and higher risk of equipment damage. Vascular scanners do not require contact with the scanner, and since the information they read is on the inside of the body, skin conditions do not affect the accuracy of the reading. Vascular scanners also work with extreme speed, scanning in less than a second. As they scan, they capture the unique pattern veins take as they branch through the hand. Compared to the retinal scanner, which is more accurate than the vascular scanner, the retinal scanner has much lower popularity, because of its intrusive nature. People generally are uncomfortable exposing their eyes to an unknown light, not to mention retinal scanners are more difficult to install, since variances in height and face angle must be accounted for.  History  Joe Rice, an automation controls engineer at Kodak's Annesley Factory, invented vein pattern recognition in the early 1980s in response to his bank cards and identity being stolen. He developed essentially a barcode reader for people and assigned the rights to the UK's NRDC (National Research Development Corporation).See his website from 1993 onwards at: https://sites.google.com/site/veinpatternhome/ * His original patent on vein matching Google \\"WO1985004088A1\\" * His US Patent on Vein Matching issued 1987 Google \\"US patent 4699149\\" * Details of his 1990 Smart door handle * His biometric Summit Talk Google \\"A third way for Biometrics\\" * His predictions for the future of Vein pattern technology: http://biometrics.mainguet.org/types/vein_JoeRice.htm The NRDC/ BTG (Thatcher privatised NRDC into BTG) made little headway in licensing vein pattern technology. The world was wedded to fingerprints and Iris patterns and Governments (the main buyers of biometric solutions) wanted open view biometrics for surveillance purposes, not a hidden, personal biometric solution. In the late 1990s BTG said they were dropping vein patterns through no commercial interest. Rice was unhappy with the BTG's decision and their implementation of vein pattern technology so he gave a talk at the Biometric Summit in Washington DC, on how he would develop vein pattern recognition. This view was countered by a following speaker from IBG (The US based international Biometric Group) who said there was insufficient information content in vein patterns for them to be used as a viable biometric. In 2002 Hitachi and Fujitsu launched vein biometric products and veins have turned out to be one of the most consistent, discriminatory and accurate biometric traits. In the mid 2000s, Rice received an invitation from Matthias Vanoni to partner in a Swiss company Biowatch SA to develop and commercialise the biowatch. Commercial applications Vascular/vein pattern recognition (VPR) technology has been developed commercially by Hitachi since 1997, in which infrared light absorbed by the haemoglobin in a subject's blood vessels is recorded (as dark patterns) by a CCD camera behind a transparent surface. The data patterns are processed, compressed, and digitized for future biometric authentication of the subject. Finger scanning devices have been deployed for use in Japanese financial institutions, kiosks, and turnstiles. Mantra Softech marketed a device in India that scans vein patterns in palms for attendance recording. Fujitsu developed a version that does not require direct physical contact with the vein scanner for improved hygiene in the use of electronic point of sale devices. Computer security expert Bruce Schneier stated that a key advantage of vein patterns for biometric identification is the lack of a known method of forging a usable \\"dummy\\", as is possible with fingerprints. Forensic identification According to a 31,000-word investigative report published in January 2011 by Georgetown University faculty and students, U.S. federal investigators used photos from the video recording of the beheading of American journalist Daniel Pearl to match the veins on the visible areas of the perpetrator to that of captured al-Qaeda operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, notably a \\"bulging vein\\" running across his hand. The FBI and the CIA used the matching technique on Mohammed in 2004 and again in 2007. Officials were concerned that his confession, which had been obtained through torture (namely waterboarding), would not hold up in court and used vein matching evidence to bolster their case. Other applications Some US hospitals, such as NYU Langone Medical Center, use a vein matching system called Imprivata PatientSecure, primarily to reduce errors. Additional benefits include identifying unconscious or uncommunicative patients, and saving time and paperwork. Dr. Bernard A. Birnbaum, chief of hospital operations at Langone, says \\"vein patterns are 100 times more unique than fingerprints\\". However, the newspaper reports of the use of vein matching to determine whether Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was Mr Pearl's murderer quoted FBI officials who described the technique as \\"less reliable\\" than fingerprints.

It is located in the Braj region. Karauli city was the capital while Mandrayal or Mandrail was another important town. Geography The state had an area of . In 1901, the population of the state was 156,786, and that of the town was 23,482. Millets, the staple food of the people, was the main agricultural produce. As of the early 20th century, there were no major industries; a little weaving, dyeing, wood-turning, and stone cutting constituted the notable cottage industries. Most goods, as also salt, sugar, cotton, buffaloes, and bullocks, were imported; rice and goats comprised the main exports. History The Maharaja of Karauli is considered as the head of the Jadaun clan of Rajputs and claim to be descendants of Krishna. The Jadauns once ruled the kingdom of Braj which included Alwar, Bharatpur, Karauli and Dholpur. In 1196 Kunwar Pal lost all of his territories to the invading Ghurids. One of the scions called Arjun Pal was able to recover some of his ancestral lands and founded the town of Karauli. The Jadauns remained independent for a century until their lands were once again captured by Mahmud I of Malwa. The Jadauns remained insignificant until they gained patronage under the Mughal emperor Akbar, the Jadaun ruler Gopaldas was made the Maharaja of Karauli and was made the commander of 2000, he also played an important role in the foundation of Agra fort on the orders of the Mughal emperor.https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V15_032.gifAn ethnographical hand-book for the N.-W. provinces and Oudh By William Crooke =British Raj= After the decline of the Mughal empire in the 18th century, Karauli was under the Maratha Empire until the Marathas were defeated by the British.

Early life Young was raised in Brooklyn, New York, where he attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School. He learned to play basketball at the church where his mother, Edna, worked. Young tried out for the team every year he was in high school, but in all four years he was cut and did not make the final roster. He graduated high school in 1995. College career Unsurprisingly, no NCAA Division I colleges recruited him, so Young attended Mitchell College, a junior college located in New London, Connecticut. and played basketball on its team. During his sophomore season, Young averaged an NJCAA Tournament record 43.6 points per game over five games, including a high of 54. His head coach, Rich Conover, who was in his first season at the helm, was instrumental in guiding Young to play at Niagara University. Young viewed Conover as an uncle, so he took that advice and enrolled at Niagara the following fall. The final two seasons of Young's NCAA eligibility were spent playing at the Division I institution. A shooting guard / small forward, he surpassed all expectations, and as a senior in 1998‚Äì99, Young led NCAA Division I in scoring at 25.1 points per game. It was the highest scoring average for a player at Niagara since Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy averaged approximately 29 in 1969‚Äì70. Young scored a career high 44 points against Siena, and that season he was named the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year. He finished his two-year Division I career with 1,152 points, 306 rebounds, 151 blocks and 130 assists. Professional athletic career Young was not selected in the 1999 NBA Draft, and thus his professional career overseas began. He played for Strasbourg IG in France.

It was a princely state in the era of British India. The last ruler of Bundi State signed the accession to join the Indian Union in 1949. History Watercolour painting of the town and pass of Bundi in Rajasthan, by an anonymous artist working in the British school, c. 1840. Sukh Niwas Palace on the edge of the Jait Sagar tank at Bundi, c. 1900 In ancient times, the area around Bundi was apparently inhabited by various local tribes, of which the Parihar Tribes Meena were prominent. Bundi and the eponymous princely state are said to derive their names from a former Meena tribe chief called Bunda Meena. Bundi was previously called ‚ÄúBunda-Ka-Nal\\", Nal meaning ‚Äúnarrow ways‚Äù. Bundi is situated in a narrow valley within the Aravalli Hills in Rajasthan. Later the region was governed by Rao Deva, who took over Bundi from Jaita Meena in 1242, renaming the surrounding area as Haravati or Haroti. For the next two centuries, the Hadas of Bundi were the vassals of the Sisodias of Mewar and ruled by the title of Rao until 1569, when Emperor Akbar conferred the title of Rao Raja upon Rao Surjan Singh after the surrender of Ranthambore Fort and his submission. In 1632, Rao Raja Chattar Sal became the ruler, he was one of the most valiant, principled and just kings of Bundi. He built the temple of Keshavarao at Keshoraipatan and Chathra Mahal at Bundi. He became king of Bundi after his grandfather Rao Ratan Singh, as his father Gopinath died while Ratan Singh was still ruling. He saw service with the Mughal forces as head of his Hada Chauhan Rajput troop and was considered an integral part of Mughal army by Shahjahan. Rao Chattar Sal was trusted by Dara Shikoh with governorship of Delhi, a rare privilege for a Hindu. He remained loyal to Shah Jahan and Dara Shikoh during the rebellion of Aurangzeb despite many temptations and even threats from Aurangzeb. Rao Chattar Sal died fighting valiantly as the head of his Hada Rajput troops in the Battle of Samugarh in 1658 along with his youngest son Bharat Singh. Rao Bhao Singh (1658‚Äì1678) the eldest son of Chhattar Sal succeeded his father to the throne of Bundi. In 1707, Bahadur Shah I conferred the title of Maharao Raja upon Raja Budh Singh.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v.9, p. 80-81 =British era= View looking along a bazaar at Bundi taken by Gunpatrao Abajee Kale, c.1900.

Consequently, Bishan Singh made a subsidiary alliance with the British East India Company on 10 February 1818, which brought him under its protection. was responsible for the creation of the pleasure palace of Sukh Niwas on the outskirts of Bundi. Maharao Raja Ram Singh (1821‚Äì89) grew up to be a much-respected ruler who initiated economic and administrative reforms and established schools for the teaching of Sanskrit. On the throne for 68 years, he was described as a grand specimen of the Rajput gentleman and \\"the most conservative prince in conservative Rajputana.\\"The Times, 30 July 1927, page 12, Issue 44647. His rule was popular and beneficial; and though during the mutiny of 1857 his attitude was equivocal, he continued to enjoy the confidence of the British, being created G.C.S.I. and a counselor of the empire in 1877 and C.I.E. in 1878. He was succeeded by his adopted son Raghubir Singh (1889‚Äì1927), who was made a K.C.S.I. in 1897 and a G.C.I.E. in 1901. His reign was blighted by two disastrous famines. Despite his best efforts at alleviation, the population of his kingdom was reduced from some 258,000 to 171,000 by 1901 due to death and emigration. Maharao Bahadur Singh (1945‚Äì77) also supported the British and served in the Burma campaign, where he earned the Military Cross for his gallantry before succeeding to the throne. He was a guest at 1947 wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.Royal Collection: Seating plan for the Ball Supper Room http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/royalwedding1947/object.asp?grouping=&exhibs;=NONE&object;=9000366&row;=82&detail;=magnify =Accession to India= At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the British abandoned their suzerainty over the princely states, which were left to decide whether to remain independent or to accede to the newly independent Dominion of India or to Pakistan.

It is located approximately east of San Diego, and borders Bonita to the southwest and La Presa to the northeast. The -high masonry arch dam impounds Sweetwater Reservoir. The dam was first constructed in 1888 as part of a system of reservoirs on San Diego County rivers designed to provide water to irrigate crops along the coast and to supply the city of San Diego and its outlying towns. Over the next few decades the dam was raised and retrofitted several times from its original height of . In 1916, a heavy flood caused both abutments of the dam to fail. The rest of the dam did not sustain heavy damage and it remains in use for flood control, water storage and recreation. Design Sweetwater Dam is a concrete thick Arch-gravity dam, straddling the Sweetwater River to form a reservoir capable of holding of water. It is high and long, with a thickness of at the base. It is equipped with an intake tower on the upstream end connected to a high-pressure conduit that cuts through the base of the dam designed to release water from different depths of the reservoir; if water is released from a lower elevation the outflow will be greater. However, due to the low flow of the river, there is typically only a trickle of water below the dam as it impounds all the inflow from upstream. Occasional large floods do hit the area, so the dam is designed to survive overtoppings and also has a pair of seven-gated spillways capable of handling more than .Wilson, p. 437American Society of Civil Engineers, pp. 201‚Äì09 The dam is operated in conjunction with Loveland Dam and its reservoir approximately upstream for flood control purposes. The dam serves as a backup water storage facility for the San Diego metropolitan area today in the case of drought, and provides some local municipal water. The reservoir serves for wildlife management and recreation among other uses. History =Planning= Postcard of the dam circa 1907 Despite having a mild climate and fertile soils, the San Diego area has a semiarid climate, and thus in its rivers most of the flow occur during the winter months, causing devastating floods. Conversely, in the summer, most of the smaller streams dry up and the larger waterways are reduced to trickles, leading to equally dangerous droughts. The bedrock of the region has notably low permeability, leaving little groundwater available (particularly when compared to nearby Los Angeles and Orange Counties). The Sweetwater River, along with others such as the San Diego River and the San Luis Rey River, was one of the few streams that did flow with abundance year round. As the population of the region grew, however, the river could no longer provide what was needed in the dry season. One of the area's early settlers, Frank Kimball, was the first to suggest the building of a dam on this particular reach of the Sweetwater River in 1869. Here the river after departing a broad valley cuts through a steep and narrow gorge, providing an ideal site for a reservoir. The original blueprints for the dam, drawn by a F. E. Brown, called for a thin-arch dam high and barely wider on its crest than at its base, capable of holding some . Groundbreaking of the dam was on November 17, 1886 and a quarry was excavated on the south side of the gorge early the following year to provide masonry rubble for the dam.American Society of Civil Engineers, p. 205 =Construction= Following groundbreaking, the dam's foundations were laid by the San Diego Land and Town Company as a large stone-and-cement block thick and high. During the early stages of construction the Sweetwater River was diverted underneath the foundation structure into a square masonry culvert in diameter. The tunnel provided sufficient discharge capacity for the river past the dam site, as 1886‚Äì1887 were below average precipitation years. However, in February 1887, the river swelled due to a minor storm and overflowed the foundations for two days. No significant damage was wrought. View of Sweetwater Reservoir As construction progressed, the original thin arch design was considered both unstable and inadequate for the county's growing water needs. Thus the projected height of the dam was increased to and the base thickness increased by . A series of specialized stone steps were constructed on the faces of the dam to provide for future increases in height.American Society of Civil Engineers, p. 206 The stone used in the dam's construction was quarried from a large rock outcropping about downstream on the south bank of the river. There were two types of stone, both metamorphic and one iron-rich, and both were considered excellent for the dam's construction. Sand was excavated from the river bottom for use in cement mixing; this was also declared exceptionally suitable.American Society of Civil Engineers, pp. 207‚Äì208 As the dam rose to a height of , the outlet tunnel at the base was sealed, and the water rose behind the structure to a controlled depth of for leakage testing purposes. The dam held and no significant seepage was recorded.American Society of Civil Engineers, p. 207 Horses and mules were used to transport stone from the quarry to the dam site using carts. At the construction site, four to five derricks ranging in height from were used to facilitate placement of the stone and cement, bucket by bucket, the latter of which was being made on-site. The dam was topped out on April 7, 1888 to a height of above its foundations.American Society of Civil Engineers, p. 209 To the south of the structure was constructed the spillway or \\"waste weir\\", consisting of eight overflow channels separated by masonry piers. Controlled by a series of wooden boards, the spillway could handle up to .American Society of Civil Engineers, p. 211 A total of of material were used in the construction of the dam, including 17,562 barrels of cement. The total cost came to $234,074.11, including preliminary investigations and purchase of the land to be flooded by the reservoir.American Society of Civil Engineers, p. 210 The dedication ceremony was on April 19, and over three thousand people came to watch. At that time, the dam was the highest masonry arch dam in the United States and was considered an engineering marvel and tourist attraction. =1911 expansion= In the winter of 1895, heavy rains caused the Sweetwater River to rise to record levels, and the dam's outlets and spillways were unable to handle the excess inflow of water. For more than 40 hours during the peak of the storm, the reservoir overtopped the dam by nearly two feet, spilling over in a massive waterfall. The floods caused severe damage to the abutments of the dam and eroded the riverbed below, but the dam survived. In response to the danger of future floods, work began in 1910 to raise the dam to a height of . To do this, a -tall vertical masonry parapet was added to the top of the dam, the spillways were reconstructed, and the intake tower was raised. This was finished in 1911, and gave the reservoir an additional capacity of about . 1916 failure The Sweetwater dam collapse of 1916 In the winter of 1915, southern California was experiencing a devastating drought that had drained area reservoirs to record low levels over more than three consecutive years, causing massive agricultural and ranching losses. Residents of San Diego County were so desperate that the city of San Diego hired a man called Charles Hatfield, known as \\"the Rainmaker\\". The city promised Hatfield $10,000 if he could make it rain significantly by the end of the year. Hatfield's venture was apparently a success, but it is not known what actually caused the massive floods that tore through the county beginning December 9, the day after he started his ill-fated scheme.Cerveny, pp. 139‚Äì144 More than thirty-nine inches (991 mm) of rain fell during the following month, and storms continued deluging the county well into early 1916. The area's rivers and streams rose to their highest recorded levels in years. More than 200 bridges were washed out, entire communities were swept away, levees collapsed, and valleys were inundated. All the bridges along the San Diego, Sweetwater and Otay rivers were washed out except for a rail bridge that was left standing alone with its ends missing. The earthen Otay Dam, several miles southeast of the Sweetwater on the Otay River, burst on January 27 sending a wall of water into southern Chula Vista. Flooding deposited so much sediment that the southern end of San Diego Bay was filled with it ‚Äì much of the sand remains today in the form of shoals that must be periodically dredged to accommodate boat traffic. The Sweetwater River rose until it reached a peak flow of on January 30, 1916 and though the dam had been increased in height and its spillway capacity enlarged, this did little to prevent it from overflowing. The reservoir overtopped the dam crest by an estimated in an event similar to, but far larger than 1895. The river breached the north abutment of the dam, then soon after the south end just left of the spillway went with it. Like in 1895, the main structure of the dam was not heavily damaged but the river eroded enough material around the structure to allow two-thirds of the reservoir to drain. The failure of the dam caused extensive damage downstream, including the destruction of over of Sweetwater Water Co. pipeline, all railway track and electric utility lines. The dam was subsequently rebuilt and an additional spillway added to pass future floods. Later events The dam in 1917 one year after floods that destroyed both abutments, showing new spillway In 1939 and 1940, the dam received a major overhaul in which the 1911 parapet was lowered by two feet and built into an emergency spillway as the two existing spillways were considered insufficient to handle large floods. The dam then came under the ownership of the Sweetwater Authority, which still runs the dam today. In the late 20th century, a new concrete coating was applied to the dam in an attempt to stop leakage. However, the dam's spillways were still considered inadequate to handle more than 20 percent of a \\"probable maximum flood\\". On April 7, 2006, the Sweetwater Dam was recognized as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Route description The scenic byway traverses along of US 64/US 74, as it routes along the north banks of the Ocoee River. At Oswald Road (Forest Road 77), the Chilhowee Scenic Spur climbs to the top of the Chilhowee Mountains. Various boating/fishing activities can be done at Parksville Lake; while canoeing, rafting and kayaking can be done at the Ocoee Whitewater Center, venue of the 1996 Olympic Canoe/Kayak Slalom Competition when the Summer Olympics were held in Atlanta, Georgia. The majority of the route is two lanes, but a short segment east of the whitewater center is four lanes. Part of the four lane section was narrowed to two lanes before the Olympics to make room for stands, and the original eastbound lanes of that section are now used as parking for the Whitewater Center. The two lane sections are the only sections of US 64 in Tennessee that are still two lanes. History The route follows the Old Copper Road, originally a wagon trail dating back to the 1850s for transporting Copper from the Copper Basin area to Cleveland and Chattanooga. The Ocoee Scenic Byway was the first National Forest Scenic Byway in the nation, designated on July 22, 1988, by the United States Forest Service (USFS). The route is prone to rockslides.

He completed a 158-page long senior thesis titled \\"The Community Action Program and Black Political Power.\\" He received a master's degree in history from Stanford University, with a concentration on modern U.S. public policy. Representative Miles S. Rapoport launched a successful bid for Connecticut Secretary of State in 1994. Fleischmann defeated five primary election opponents to become the Democratic candidate to succeed Rapoport in the 18th Assembly District and won the general election that November. He was re-elected in 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. In 2010, House Majority Leader Denise Merrill launched a successful bid for Connecticut Secretary of State. Flesichmann narrowly lost a bid to Brendan Sharkey to succeed Merrill as House Majority Leader in the 2011 legislative session. Fleischmann was Chairman of the House Education Committee and of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Elementary and Secondary Education. He had given particular attention to strengthening state funding for public schools, increasing academic rigor for students and educators alike, and protecting children from harmful pesticides. When he served on the Government Administration and Elections Committee, he was a leading proponent of campaign finance reform - a set of statutory changes that set up Connecticut's Citizens' Election Program - allowing candidates to collect only small contributions ($5-$100) from individuals, and then receive a public grant for their campaign. He had opposed subsequent efforts to undermine this system since its creation in 2005. Fleischmann, a 12-term incumbent, ran for re-election in 2018 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Jillian Gilchrest. Fleischmann serves as President and CEO of Nutmeg Big Brothers Big Sisters, an affiliate of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Fleischmann and his wife live in West Hartford with their two daughters.

It was originally published in Paris on November 27, 1827, before being published in London three days later on November 30. It was not published in the United States until January 9, 1828, in Philadelphia. Soon after its publication it was adapted for theater both in the United States and in England.Gordan 66 The novel follows the activities of the sailor Dick Fid, free black sailor Scipio Africanus and Royal Navy officer James Wilder as they encounter the famous pirate, \\"The Red Rover\\". A contemporary reviewer in the North American Review noted how Cooper was particularly good at writing sea novels such as The Red Rover, the sea being his more natural element than what the author calls wilderness novels which focused on an Indian introducing a white man to the wilderness, like The Last of the Mohicans. In addition, The Red Rover presents some of the first serious depictions of characters of African lineage in American literature.  Characters  The two black characters, Scipio Africanus, a free black sailor, and Cassandra, a slave attendant, throughout the novel remain distanced and separate from their white companions. While all the other main characters end the book with positive outcomes, Scipio finds a tragic end. Therman O'Daniel suggests, that though these are some of the first black characters to be seriously treated in American literature, they still receive unsatisfactory outcomes for all their actions. For Cooper, the sea novel offered an opportunity to blur social barriers between characters. This is particularly evident in his treatment of women, such as a girl disguised as a cabin boy in The Red Rover who is able to function within the crew, even though she is female. Additionally, throughout the novel, a tight friendship exists between Scipio Africanus, fellow sailor Dick Fid, and a Royal Navy officer whom they befriend after saving his life. Though the two men treat him like an officer, deferring to him with respect, they still remain friendly. Genre Cooper is one of the authors credited with helping pioneer the sea novel genre. For him, however, American history before his time hardly offered real maritime tradition to seize in his historical fiction; instead he innovated, writing purely fictional pieces, unlike his novels about other events in American history. Theatrical adaptation Forty four days after the first American publication of the novel in 1828, the first theatrical adaptation was performed in the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. The adaptation was composed by actor Samuel H. Chapman. The adaptation was published in 1828 ‚Äì or possibly later ‚Äì by a publisher in Philadelphia.Gordan 66-67 On May 1, 1828, a second adaptation of the novel was performed in the Park Theater, New York. It was performed multiple times, documented to have had multiple successful runs.Gordan 69-70 A third play is mentioned to have been performed in the Lafayette Circus (Theatre) in New York, however no other evidence exists of it. Subsequently, these early American adaptations were performed another four times before 1862, the evidence is clear which was performed at each performance.Gordan 70 At the same time as American adaptations were being performed, four adaptations were being performed in England. These all made debuts in 1829 at various theaters: one at the Royal Cobourg Theatre, one at the Adelphi Theatre in London, one in the Surrey Theatre, London, and the last in the Sadler's Wells Theatre. Additionally a Victorian burlesque, unacknowledged by early scholars of the plays and books that parodied one of the earlier London adaptations of the novel was performed in the Royal Strand Theatre in London in 1877 and adapted by Francis Cowley Burnand.Gordan 70-74 Critical reception In 1828, the North American Review reviewed the work, generally praising it. The Review commented \\"he has, in this instance, done more and better things for his name, than upon any former occasion\\", also comparing the text and style to that of Sir Walter Scott.North American Review 139-130 The Review also was very critical of the use of the Indian native in wilderness novels and was pleased that Cooper had returned to \\"his own element\\" of the Sea from the misuse of the Indian which he was prone to in other novels.North American Review 144-145 However, the reviewer did note, the \\"Indistinctness\\" which happens at the closing of scenes, but left that as his only criticism.North American Review 154 Modern reviewer Susan Manning, notes that Red Rover, despite being perhaps one of the most successful novels by Cooper for the contemporary 19th century literary circles, is very dry to read for modern readers, \\"confusing and obscure in places, banal in others; a full quarter of this long narrative elapses, slowly, before anything emerges which could properly be called a story.\\" References ;Works cited Category:Novels by James Fenimore Cooper Category:1827 American novels Category:Pirate books Category:Nautical fiction ","title":"The Red Rover"},{"id":"30551673","text":"A rehabilitation policy is one intending to reform criminals rather than punish them and/or segregate them from the greater community. History Some early eighteenth and twentieth century prisons were proponents of rehabilitative policies. \\"Early American prisons, such as those at Auburn, Ossining, and Pittsburgh during the 1820s, implemented rehabilitative principles. These early programs isolated convicts in order to remove them from the temptations that had driven them to crime and to provide each inmate with time to listen to her conscience and reflect on her deeds...This belief that all convicts would return to their inherently good natures when removed from the corrupting influences of society gave way to more aggressive forms of treatment informed by the rise of social scientific studies into criminal behavior. Research in psychology, criminology, and sociology provided reformers with a deeper understanding of deviance and sharper tools with which to treat it. Rehabilitation became a science of reeducating the criminal with the values, attitudes, and skills necessary to live lawfully.\\" The philosophy of rehabilitation is that \\"not the offense but the character and reformability of the offender should determine his treatment.\\" \\"Then, in the early 1970s, rehabilitation suffered a precipitous reversal of fortune. The larger disruptions in American society in this era prompted a general critique of the ‚Äústate run‚Äù criminal justice system. Rehabilitation was blamed by liberals for allowing the state to act coercively against offenders, and was blamed by conservatives for allowing the state to act leniently toward offenders. In this context, the death knell of rehabilitation was seemingly sounded by Robert Martinson‚Äôs (1974b) influential 'nothing works' essay, which reported that few treatment programs reduced recidivism. This review of evaluation studies gave legitimacy to the antitreatment sentiments of the day; it ostensibly ‚Äúproved‚Äù what everyone 'already knew': Rehabilitation did not work.\\" Deterrence (legal) and incapacitation ruled over the criminal justice system until the 90's where an unmanageable increase of the prisoner population created gaps where the benefits of rehabilitative policy could be discussed. \\"The increase of the prisoner population in the United States has resulted in shifting opinions on punishment vs. rehabilitation policies. Policies =Indeterminate sentencing= Indeterminate sentences are sentences where a judge indicates a minimum and maximum time for an offender to be imprisoned. The prisoner may be released anytime between the established minimum and maximum time. Indeterminate sentencing expanded discretion into the prison system so that prisoner rehabilitation could be analysed on the individual level. Indeterminate sentencing is personalized opposed to determinate sentencing which is standardized. \\"Advocates of determinate sentencing have argued that inmates support determinate sentencing because they strongly resent uncertainty of time to be served and sentencing inequity under indeterminate sentencing.\\" Because indeterminate sentencing expands discretion, offenders with similar crimes may serve vastly different prison times. Indeterminate sentencing exchanges equity of law for personalization of rehabilitation. =Parole= Parole is the conditional release of a prisoner who has served a part of their sentence back into the community under supervision and conditions that if violated will result in rearrest. There are 784,408 parolees in the United States Although parole began as an effort to reintegrate offenders into the community, \\"...parole supervision has shifted ever more toward surveillance, drug testing, monitoring curfew and collecting restitution.\\" That is, the context of parole has shifted from reintegration with society into control of the individual on parole. Rather than parole being for rehabilitation, it has become in practice a less restrictive form of imprisonment. It is also argued that parole is a deterred prison entry program due to the high percentage of parolees that end up in prison due to violating terms of their parole. Many violated parole terms are technical infractions. That is, \\"noncriminal infractions\\" such as \\"failure to comply with curfews, pass alcohol and drug urinalysis screens, avoid contact with other offenders, maintain employment and/or report unemployment, attend meetings with probation and parole officers, make restitution payments and/or perform community service hours, and attend individual and/or group therapy meetings.\\" This is of particular concern since parole officer discretion determines parolee restrictions as well as the consequences for violating such restrictions. =Probation= Probation is a period of time where an offender lives under supervision and under a set of restrictions. Violations of these restrictions could result in arrest. Probation is typically an option for first time offenders with high rehabilitative capacity. At its core, it is \\"a substitute for prison\\", with the goal being to \\"spare the worthy first offender from the demoralizing influences of imprisonment and save him from recidivism\\". In the United States, there are 4,162,536 probationers. Probationers are supervised by probation officers just as parolees are supervised by parole officers. Probation officers have similar authority as parole officers do to restrict mobility, social contact, and mandate various other conditions and requirements. Probationers just like parolees are at high risk of imprisonment due to violation of their restrictions that may not be classified as criminal. In the United States, 40% of probationers were sent to jail or prison for technical and criminal violations. 400px =Expungement= Expungement is when an offense is removed from an offender's criminal record. In many states, however, an \\"expungement\\" does not erase or remove an offense. Instead it converts it to a dismissal as opposed to a conviction. Minor offenses where rehabilitative success is met are deemed in some cases to be expungable in order for the offender to move past their mistake and live a completely normal life unrestricted by a past mistake. The Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2007 allows non-violent offenders the possibility of having their records expunged. Criminal records limit what occupational and educational goals an individual may pursue, and it is noted that such restrictions may be correlated with recidivism. To fit the criteria of the act the offender must: # ...never been convicted of a violent offense (including an offense under State law that would be a violent offense if it were Federal) and has never been convicted of a nonviolent offense other than the one for which expungement is sought; # ...fulfilled all requirements of the sentence of the court in which conviction was obtained, including completion of any term of imprisonment or period of probation, meeting all conditions of a supervised release, and paying all fines; # ...remained free from dependency on or abuse of alcohol or a controlled substance a minimum of 1 year and has been rehabilitated, to the satisfaction of the court referred to in section 3633(b), if so required by the terms of a supervised release; # ...obtained a high school diploma or completed a high school equivalency program; and # ...completed at least one year of community service, as determined by the court referred to in section 3633(b). R =Separate juvenile justice system= Separate courts, detention facilities, and programs for juvenile offenders acknowledges that children, often not fully developed enough to know right from wrong, are deserving of separate rehabilitation efforts and processes. Prior to the late 1800s, child offenders were processed, trialled, and punished the same way as an adult would be. However, \\"By the mid-1920s, reforms separating children and adults who violated criminal laws into two separate court systems swept across the country.\\" Although there was a time that \\"...judges primarily concerned themselves with the best interests of the delinquent child, victims' rights statutes now require juvenile courts to balance the rehabilitative needs of the child with other competing interests such as accountability to the victim and restoration of communities impacted by crime.\\" See also * Rehabilitation (penology)  References  Category:Penology Category:Probation ","title":"Rehabilitation policy"},{"id":"30551686","text":"Sexy Cora (born Carolin Ebert, civil name Carolin Wosnitza; 2 May 1987 ‚Äì 20 January 2011) was a German pornographic actress, model, singer, exotic dancer, wife of Tim Wosnitza, and reality show participant. Cora was born in Berlin. She was one of the participants of the 10th season of Big Brother Germany. Cora released two music singles after her Big Brother participation: \\"My Love ‚Äì La, La, La\\" and \\"Lass uns kicken (Alles klar wunderbar)\\".  Medical issues and death  Cora was hospitalized in 2009 after trying to break the world record for the number of fellatios performed in one day. She was trying for 200 men but was unable to pass 75. Cora suffered a heart attack on 11 January 2011, during her breast enlargement surgery at a plastic surgery clinic in Hamburg. It was her sixth such operation. Minutes into the procedure, she went into cardiac arrest, causing her blood pressure to steadily drop and her organs to stop functioning. She sustained heavy brain damage as a result. She was moved to a local hospital and placed in a medically induced coma for a week due to her condition. Her husband, Tim Wosnitza, claimed that he was told by doctors that she would die due to the trauma to her breasts, and was at her side for nine days until she died on 20 January 2011. Police investigated the clinic for possible treatment errors. On 21 January, the two doctors who performed the surgery on Cora were charged with negligent manslaughter. A statement from the clinic said the doctors were \\"extremely upset and deeply regret the death of patient C.W.\\" and that they are giving \\"full and complete support\\" to authorities investigating her death. Cora was buried in a pink coffin at Hamburg's Ohlsdorf Cemetery on 2 February 2011. In May 2011, however, cemetery officials demanded that her husband remove a four-feet tall marble angel and memorial photos that marked the grave, claiming the $15,000 installation was \\"too sexy\\". They argued that the grave's markings were inappropriate and could be deemed \\"offensive by other mourners visiting the cemetery,\\" one of the largest in the world. On 5 February 2013, the Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported that a 56-year-old anesthesiologist had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of the Cora.

Activities were coordinated by a full-time health educator. Initial activities were begun during the summer of 1986, and increased progressively each year. The number of activities and materials provided, the amount of media exposure, and the intensity of the campaign were substantially greater in 1988 than in previous years. To increase parental awareness, professionally produced public service announcements were shown on television 50 times per quarter and during every third Seattle Mariners baseball game and aired regularly on local radio stations. Two press conferences, three local television programs, and 30 print articles featured the campaign. Bicycle shops in King County were given 8000 bicycle hang tags in 1987 through 1988, which reminded parents to purchase helmets. Some 50 000 informational pamphlets were provided to physicians and health departments in 1987 and 1988 for distribution to patients, and mailings were sent to all 6500 members of the Washington State Medical Association in 1988. During 1987 through 1988, the Coalition also participated in numerous community events and made presentations to Parent-Teacher Associations and youth group leaders. To promote helmet use, a bicycle safety program was implemented in Seattle public elementary schools in 1988. Posters featuring a group of freestyle cyclists popular with youngsters were distributed to all elementary schools. More than 50 000 stickers promoting helmets were distributed to schools and youth groups and at bicycling events. Incentives were provided to children who wore helmets at various bicycling events in 1988, which included 2000 free McDonald's french fry coupons and 564 free Seattle Mariners baseball tickets. Helmet cost was addressed by the distribution of more than 100 000 discount coupons (lowering the cost of helmets to about $25) through physicians' offices, schools, youth groups, and community events during 1988. Thirteen hundred helmets were sold at cost through the Parent-Teacher Associations in 1987 and 1988, and another 1300 were donated in 1988 to youth groups serving low-income children.\\"Bicycle Helmet Campaign Guide.

Of some literary and historical interest because of the association with its builder, Jean-Jacques Lefranc, the first Marquis de Pompignan, the chateau is noteworthy today for containing in its grounds a good example, though in neglected and dilapidated condition, of a parc √† fabriques - a landscape garden with architectural constructions and hydraulic systems (together known in English as follies). Acquired by its present owner in 1990, the chateau itself is in good repair, though sparsely furnished, as it serves to house the owner's collection of keyboard instruments. This may be the largest private collection in France of keyboard instruments from around the world. Refurbishment work on the chateau is in progress with the object of creating a permanent museum to display this collection to the general public.To read an article (in French; dated March 2010) published by the regional newspaper, where the current owner outlines his plans for the chateau, see here. The article contains a recent unposed photograph of the main facade of the building. Within the grounds, a deconsecrated church provides a 200-seat concert hall, and in recent years international piano competitions have been held there.

These bodies could also by agreement change the perimeter of the field of view. See French Wikipedia article here; the section Cons√©quences sur les abords gives details and further references. to the remainder of the park or its contents. Description of the chateau The village of Pompignan is located a day's journey (25 km) from Toulouse on the natural road along the right bank of the Garonne to Bordeaux, and it was a way stop even in pre-Roman times. Its name is derived from Pompinianum, the domain of Pompinius, a notable of the Gallo-Roman era, whose villa was sited on the edge of the hillside about a kilometer south of the present chateau.Details here provided by the mairie of Pompignan. There is evidence to suggest that a ninth-century feudal manor house existed on or close to the present chateau site. The modern village grew up at the foot of the chateau in the time of the Lefrancs, and its layout and facilities were shaped by the needs and gifts of the owners. The chateau was built on the foundations of the existing manor house in the emerging neo-classical style, similar in some respects to the Petit Trianon at Versailles (built between 1762 and 1768, a few years later than Pompignan). However, while the fenestration proportions are similar, the facades at Pompignan are much less ornate, relying for their decorative effect on brickwork details, the play of colour between brick and rendering, and on the indentations produced by the short nibs at the centre and either end of the main (south-eastern) fa√ßade. Both buildings are oriented towards views of landscape gardens, but Pompignan was planned as such, whereas the hameau at the Petit Trianon was added twenty years afterwards, by a different architect and patron. The terrace on which the chateau sits, some ten to twenty metres above the village, is girdled with a massive brick retaining wall, in good condition, which is a listed item in the protection notices. Lefranc‚Äôs chateau is built on a stone base, mainly from pink Toulouse brick, with delicate use of gray render to achieve a tawny effect in good light. It is carefully oriented (along a northwest-southeast axis) to take advantage of existing natural views created by its position on a terrace overlooking the valley of the Garonne to the west and the rising hillside to the east. Nearly all the windows, and the terraces on three sides, provide excellent views. The fourth side consists of a library with clerestory and stained-glass windows, and it overlooks the entry gate-lodge,There are good images of the gate lodge at Google Street View (rue Lefranc de Pompignan), in which the scallop of St Jacques can be seen crowning the decorative grillwork on the gate, and also of sections of the brick retaining wall (Chemin de la Vign√©e). farm buildings and church. The plan of the chateau is a rectangle of some 18m by 50m, with a semi-circular two-story bay on the north side. A sketch of the facade dating from 1802from one of the sketches in the carnet de 1802, reproduced in Cranga, P189, fig 18. shows a one-story columned semi-circular portico at the central nib, and a one-story bay extension to the southern nib. These are no longer in place. The monuments listings (refs 4 and 5 below) note \\"... [a] ground floor, two tiled floors, an attic floor ...\\" and \\"... a semi-circular part on the north facade which was once occupied by a theater.\\" Although undocumented here, there is also an extensive basement level. The 'habitable' floor area, at 2,700 sqm without counting the bay, is almost twice that of the Petit Trianon, and more than half that of the Grand Trianon. Work began in 1745, and received further impetus - and funding - with Lefranc's marriage in 1757.To Marie-Antoinette F√©licit√© de Caulaincourt, widow of Pierre Grimod du Fort, paymaster general of Postes et Relais de France, the early French postal system. Cited in Cranga, p188 The Toulousian architect Nelle (or Nelli) was in charge of the works, which probably took place in two phases. The renovated church, and hence certainly the main building, was in place by 1762,Tarn-et- Garonne Departmental Archives, 3 E 2 757, per Cranga p191, footnote 23. thus pre-dating the Petit Trianon by several years. This phase included the construction of the retaining and boundary walls, and improvements to the chateau de Monplaisir. It is clear from documents preserved in the family archives that the Marquis de Pompignan was personally involved with the architectural conception and the ornamentation of the buildings, evidenced by letters, plans, designs and annotations in his own hand. After he left Paris definitivelyHe was effectively laughed out of town, by sustained and vituperative attacks by Voltaire and other academicians whose votes for the seat he had rewarded with vehement criticism in his maiden speech to the Academy in 1760. He was, however, rewarded with the marquisate by the king in 1763, for his services in defending royal and ecclesiastical privileges. in 1763, Lefranc was again able to devote more of his attention to the garden project, and major structural elements were put in place between 1766 and 1774.Per Cranga, p191, first para, it is possible to follow from documents in the Lefranc family archives the progress of the works. It was finally judged complete by its author (who was then 71 years old) in 1780, 35 years after he had started. Jean-Georges-Louis-Marie Lefranc de Pompignan (1760‚Äì1840), son of the builder, inherited the estate on the death of his father in 1784. Like his father, he too married well,To Louise de Beaumont-Baynac, niece of the archbishop of Paris, Christophe de Beaumont. Cited in Cranga, p191 and was in a position to attend to his country estates. It appears as if he also commissioned worksCranga, p191 and footnote 26. in the park, and it is not possible at present to distinguish which Lefranc was responsible for which part of the garden. The park and its follies The main fa√ßade looks out over lawns with magnificent specimen trees, then across undulating meadows which give glimpses of the follies and water features, and finally upwards over the rising forest until the view is cut off at the horizon created by the top of the ridge. No buildings are visible from this direction. (The planned railway line - see below - will run parallel to this fa√ßade at a distance of some 250m.) In the opposite direction, the windows facing a little north of west overlook the church and small village of Pompignan, through which run, in parallel and only some 60m apart at this point, the main road from Toulouse to Montauban and, west of it, the Canal de Garonne. Beyond lies the flat valley of the Garonne and the low hills of the Gers. On a clear day, the Pyrenees are visible along the southern horizon, and the short southern fa√ßade faces the mountains more directly, while also allowing the remainder of the village, the road and the canal to be observed in the direction of Toulouse. The terrace on which the chateau and its lawns sit forms the point of a promontory, and the park stretches away from it to the east, enclosing a thickly-wooded valley of undulating and then rising land some 35 hectares in extent. The park‚Äôs long south-eastern boundary is formed by the road running along the edge of the ridge above, the chemin de la moissagaise, part of the ancient pilgrimage Way of St James that leads from Moissac, some 40 km downstream, to Compostella in Spain. Within the park just off this road is a small shrine, which still receives visits, especially in the months of May and June, the traditional time of the pilgrimage. = The idea of the park = The design of the chateau is representative of the move away from the extreme ornamentation and grandiosity of buildings prevailing at the end of the 17th and early 18th centuries and the move towards simpler and more classical lines. This tendency was echoed in garden design by a move away from formal, 'French' gardens, and towards the ideas incorporated in the 'English' garden which was coming into vogue in France by the mid-18th century: informal, natural-seeming, painterly landscapes, enhanced with built structures (follies) to accompany views, disguise functional structures, create moods or references to landscapes from antiquity or imagined. Lefranc spent much of his early life in the Ch√¢teau de Cayx, where some of the inspiration (in terms of siting, landscape and views) for Pompignan is found. Cayx had at least one folly as well, a belvedere,A picture of this structure, a semi-circular porch supported by seven columns from which Lefranc's additions have been removed, can be found in Cranga, p195. which Lefranc converted into his study, and in which he wrote Didon (1734), his first literary success. He began thinking about the garden long before he started work on it, evidenced by his description of a visit to Fontaine-de-Vaucluse in 1740. The fragment documenting this contains only a description of the scenic valley, but the village was home to Petrarch, who famously described his two gardens there: one created by the river and its cliffs, for admiration and inspiration, but inaccessible; the other near his house beside the river, where ... art surmounts nature ... and where he ... gathered the labourers, the fishermen and the shepherds; we rolled giant stones, built up a fortification against the Nymphs (that is, the river in spate), we carved out an altar for the Muses; soon we could see the Helicon, Parnassus, the Hippocrene; and we planted the forest of the poets.Description de la fontaine de Vaucluse (Second edition), J. Gu√©rin (Ed), 1813, pp58-61 for Lefranc; pp 70-75 for Petrarch quote.] = The park as it was - the carnet de 1802 = In 1802, a series of pencil drawings of the chateau and its park (the carnet or notebook of 1802)Details of this section (and parts of the history) are taken from the one serious study to date on the history of the chateau and park, Le Parc √Ä Fabriques du Chateau de Pompignan: Une Illustration de l‚ÄôArt des Jardins dans le Midi de la France, Yves et Marie-Fran√ßoise Cranga, in Memoirs de la Soci√©t√© Arch√©ologique du Midi de la France, Toulouse, 2003, pp179-201. The work can be found here , where the sketches from 1802 as well as some photographs taken by the authors can be seen. The 1802 notebook is held privately (in the Olivier collection, Montauban), but Cranga reproduces most of the drawings and writes a brief summary of each fabrique mentioned. was created by an unsigned handEvidence points to Germain Chabert, later successful as a painter and engraver. Pompignan - the first stop on the tour of eleven sites sketched - is less than two kilometers from his natal village, Grisolles, and the sketchbook as whole is attentive to both architectural details and landscape, necessary for his studies in archeology. Details in Cranga, p179, note 4. which depict some of the fabriques as they existed at the time of the visit. :The Gaulish temple There is an image of a small hexagonal temple, surmounted by a miniature portico, and nearby a statue of St Bonaventure. The ruins of this folly - though not the statue - still exist, on a small rise in clear view of someone leaving the chateau, but all that remains now is the exposed brick frame, showing the arched opes but without an upper structure.A good picture in colour from October 2010 can be seen in a local newspaper article :The Egyptian tomb This folly draws on architectural themes from ancient Egypt, although the form is not pyramidal. There is an obelisk nearby, carved with hieroglyphs and borne on the back of four tortoises. It was possible to access the building through an underground passage. The path to this monument was cut out of the hillside and several bridges were used to overcome differences in level. The Egyptian tomb is the only folly to survive to the present with its structure essentially intact. :The Gothic bridge A high-arched, steeply-approached bridge in Gothic style with decorated balustrades is shown spanning a stream. It no longer exists. :Mount Parnassus At the edge of the park there is a little hill or mound, surrounded by a large estate wall which is entered through a formal gated doorway. This was, according to the note on the drawing . . . Mount Parnassus, on which Mr de Pompignan the elder (i.e. Jean-Jacques, the first marquis) composed some of his poetry. The raised area still existed in 1911.Cranga, p182 and footnote 5. :The hermitage This was a small building in the classical style, intended to bring to mind the shelter constructed in a remote place by a hermit; the retreat of the sage, a place to foster philosophy. Its location within the park is not known.Cranga, p182 and fig 9. :The old monument and the little tomb This drawing shows two follies, which must have been near to each other. The monument is sketched as two columns carrying a pediment, but details are too sparse to make out whether it was a portico, a fountain or a little temple. There is an annotation on the sketch regarding the tomb: \\"An ancient tomb built by Mr. de Pompignan, in black marble, with two urns coming from near Toulouse\\", suggesting that the results of archeological digs were re-utilised in the garden. :The monument to friendship, to hope, to memory, to regret At the centre of a circular green space stands a little altar with an inscription and bearing a funerary urn. It transforms the setting into a place of memory, conducive to melancholy.Cranga, p184 and fig 14. :The house of poor Jeanne At the edge of a grove of trees lies a little thatched country house, by the bank of a stream which crosses a ditch. The weeping willow adds a note of sweet melancholy to a typical rural scene. It is the house of a poor woman, and is designed to evoke the cabin of Baucis and Philemon.Cranga p185 and fig 14. The story of Baucis and Philemon, from Ovid, tells of their humble but famously happy and hospitable home. Their generosity to the gods was rewarded by transforming their home into a temple, and making them after their simultaneous deaths, its permanent guardians, in the form of two intertwined trees (an oak and a linden). :The column A funerary column in brick, which seems to have commemorative connotations, supports \\"an infant in fired clay, almost naked, with a crest placed behind him, upset and wiping his tears with a cloth\\".The description, cited in Cranga p184 and footnote 10, is attributed to Paul Mesp√© after a visit in 1952. Mesp√©'s photograph (Cranga p199, fig 27) gives good image of this statue at the time of his visit. The column is still extant, visible from the chateau at the edge of the lawn, but Cranga reports that by 1981 the statue had been replaced by a mythical monster; and his own photograph shows the column deeply overgrown with ivy.Cranga, p184, footnotes 10 and 11. = The park as it is = Ownership history The seigneury, or feudal lordship, of Pompignan was in the hands of the Maurand family, before passing to the Galards, then to the viscounts of Terride, and to others again, before its acquisition by Jaques Lefranc. Buildings on the site of the present chateau have been documented since at least the 16th century, when it was owned by a family called Vi√ßoise. The building was renovated when the property came into the hands of the Caumont-Montbeton family in the 17th century. Jacques Lefranc came to own the property sometimeLikely around 1709, when Jaques Lefranc moved with the Cours des Aides to Montauban from Cahors. in the early years of the 18th century. The family were originally landlords of the Ch√¢teau de Cayx (or see Ch√¢teau de Ca√Øx on French Wiki, which gives more detail), some 12 km northwest of Cahors, where they had served since 1640 as hereditary presidents of the regional Cours des Aides, which was located there. When Louise XIV ordered the court to be moved to Montauban (some 60 km south of Cahors over difficult roads), during the presidency of Jacques Lefranc in the early years of the century, the family purchased the lands at Pompignan (some 20 km to the southwest of Montauban) as their local residence. Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Jacques‚Äô eldest son, was raised mainly at Cayx, and in his earlier years styled himself ‚ÄúLefranc de Caix‚Äù. He began his association with the Cours des Aides in 1730, and took over its presidency in 1747. He began working on the chateau in 1745, a project that was to take 35 years to complete. His marriage to a rich and ambitious widow in 1757 obviated the need to work for the state, and she encouraged his literary and paid for his architectural projects. Jean-Jacques Lefranc was elevated to the marquisate by royal appointment, for services rendered (in defending monarchical and ecclesiastical powers against opposition generated by the Encyclop√©distes) in 1763, and from this point his garden began to get recognition as a proper parc du chateau (that is, of a marquis). His son, Jean-Georges-Louis-Lefranc de Pompignan (1760‚Äì1840) inherited the chateau and the marquisate on the death of his father in 1784. John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a formative year visiting France at the age of 14 with a two-week stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long lettersJohn Stuart Mill, The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XXVI - Journals and Debating Speeches Part I, ed. John M. Robson (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988). Accessed from http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/260 on 2011-02-04 to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by then something of a connoisseur of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the beliefBy John M Robson in the introduction to Collected Works of JS Mill, p7 that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. But we can take it that the garden must have been in good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it. Jean- Georges Lefranc gifted the estate in 1823 to his son, Jean-Marie-Claude- Alphonse (1788‚Äì1869), on the occasion of his marriage to the owner of the ch√¢teau d‚ÄôHordosseNow a hotel, its brochures contain good pictures of the building and site near N√©rac, about 100 km away in the Lot-et-Garonne. The third marquis was the last to reside at Pompignan, transferring his activities to his wife's residence, and selling the chateau (while his father was still living) to another nobleman, Alexandre-C√©sar, Comte de la Panouse, in 1833.Departmental Archives, Haute-Garonne, 3E 27 489. Cited in Cranga, p192. By that time, the landscape garden was neglected and had become a wooded area; in 1842 the departmental archives record complaints of lack of maintenance and tree overgrowth causing damage to the church, which was demolished in 1844, the materials being re-used to build the present St Gregory's.Departmental Archives, Tarn-et-Garonne, 3 E 2 784, cited in Cranga, p192 A. de Bray, collector-general of finance of Haute-Garonne, owned the property sometime before its purchase by J.-G. Coustou-Coysevox, who between 1866 and 1869 installed the editorial offices of Moniteur de l‚ÄôArch√©ologie in the chateau. Adrien H√©brard, director of Le Temps, acquired and modified the ch√¢teau according to the taste of the day. It is to him we owe the achievement, by Gaston Virebent and his son, of the grand dining room, whose walls are clad with ceramic panels carrying a blue pattern set into the wooden paneling, itself highlighted by gildingIn September 2010 La Depeche du Midi carried an article containing an unposed image which shows this panelwork. ‚Äì and the restructuring of the park. However, the restructuring involved ... the destruction of an admirable park whose trees furnished wood to a sawmill for two years ...These two paragraphs are taken from Cranga, p192, and the quote is from H. Soulange-Bodin, Ch√¢teaux anciens de France et du Jura, 1962, p. 201, cited in Cranga, p 192, footnote 32. The estate was purchased sometime in 1928 by the Dominicaines de l'Immacul√©e Conception, an order of Dominican sisters who catered to the needs of blind children. They transformed the place to suit their needs - converting the library to a chapel, the orangery into a retreat house, and the attics into dormitories. They also concealed some of the stuccowork sculptures of classical figures installed by Lefranc, but these have now been revealed again. In 1929 the mother house and novitiate moved from Toulouse to Pompignan. The chateau was sold again when the order moved back to Toulouse in 1987.Site of Dominicans of the Immaculate Conception at . Proposed railway through the park of the chateau = Route of proposed railway through grounds = The proposed railway line is to consist of two sets of tracks, a high-speed line above ground, carried partially on a viaduct across the valley floor, and a TGV line which will run through the park in a tunnel. The lines are to run parallel to each other, 150m apart, for about 500m from north to south through the central and widest part of the park, neatly bisecting both the valley above the chateau and the main stream running through it which feeds the hydraulic system. = Other route options to be explored = Some of the villages along the proposed line formed an association, Unions pour la Sauvegarde des Villages (USV in documents. ~ Associations for Saving the Villages), to promote an alternative route. This would leave the existing line near St Jory, about 10 km south of the point it is now due to make the eastward turn, and rejoin the proposed route just after Pompignan, but above it and out of sight. On 28 September 2010 a directiveMinisterial press release here. See p3, final point (in French) was issued by minister Jean-Louis Borloo, in political charge of the project. In relation to the sector containing Pompignan, and in response to representations made by local communities, three alternative routes were examined and compared with the route (through the chateau's park) originally proposed, which is still considered on balance the most favourable. However, according to the minister, the proposals advocated by USV (essentially running the tracks close to the existing A62 motorway, which mounts the scarp at a shallower angle some 10 km south of Pompignan), merited study in more depth before a decision could be made. These two options were therefore to be studied and compared in detail, the results to be available by the beginning of 2011, with a view to seeing whether the proposals of the communities could be accommodated. On 17 February a meeting was held between Thierry Mariani, secretary of state for transport, and the USV representative Thierry Fourcassier. The USV sought assurances that the comparative in-depth analysis of the ‚ÄúD‚Äù and ‚ÄúUSV‚Äù route alternatives would be continued. The Secretary stated: :\\"At the moment the study of the ‚ÄúD‚Äù route which has been investigated for longer than the ‚ÄúUSV‚Äù route is definitely more advanced. Some elected representatives approached me to request approval of the ‚ÄúD‚Äù route from the month of March and without completing the comparative analysis. I refused: No decision between the ‚ÄúD‚Äù and ‚ÄúUSV‚Äù routes will be taken without having the detailed results of the legitimate multi-criteria comparative analysis, which seems likely to be ready sometime in May.‚Äù From the USV site [at http://sauvonspompignan.unblog.fr/2011/02/19/lanalyse-comparative-est- legitime-et-ira-jusquau-bout/ = Decision = On 3 June 2011, Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet informed the regional and departmental prefect that the \\"D\\" route had been selected for detailed studies which would lead to the final track routing.The minister said that the comparative studies had shown that the impact of the alternative USV route would be at best as disruptive and at worst twice as bad as the \\"D\\" route from the perspective of dwellings affected; that the impact on commercial buildings would be three to four times as bad; that the vineyards would be at least as badly affected; and that the cost would be increased by between ‚Ç¨160m and ‚Ç¨250m.

According to the Homeowners Association of North Carolina, presently in the state there are over 18,000 homeowner associations accounting for roughly 53% of households. The statute consists of three articles, which respectively cover general provisions, development, and management of planned communities. Article 1: General Provisions Article I states that the North Carolina Planned Community Act is applicable only to a planned community created on or after January 1, 1999. Planned communities created before January 1, 1999 can operate under the statute if they express it in their community declaration. The law does not apply to communities that contain less than 20 lots or are not for residential use, unless agreed to in the community declaration. The statute cannot be changed by agreement or exploited by its limitations. Article I also protects planned communities against zoning discrimination. It is illegal to impose any zoning, building, or real estate codes that have not been imposed on other non-planned residential communities. Eminent domain is a hot button issue that has affected the relationship between the government and its citizens. The North Carolina Planned Community Act provides a payment allocation plan for lots taken by eminent domain. If a portion of the lot was taken, the lot owner is to be compensated for the loss the property value. Article 2: Development Article II of the North Carolina Planned Community Act contains provisions for establishing, changing, and terminating a planned residential neighborhood. All records pertaining to a planned residential community must be registered in the county or counties in which they reside. In order to establish a planned community, the community declaration needs to be registered, similar to a deed, with the county. All declarations and bylaws set forth by the community are absolute, except in situations in which it goes against the North Carolina Planned Community Act. Article II also sets 67% as the minimum amount of affirmation votes needed to amend the community declaration. The law also protects a homeowner association against lawsuits regarding amendments after one year has passed. In order to terminate a planned residential community, the declaration must require at least 80% of votes. Also, if the neighborhood association is terminated, the common elements can be sold but the homes do not, unless otherwise agreed to in the community declaration. A home foreclosure within the planned community does not remove the home from the homeowner association. However, the new owner can require the association to remove the residence from the homeowner association. Article 3: Management Article III describes the organization, powers, and the duties included within the management of a planned residential community. Arguably, the most significant part of Article III is that planned communities are created as a non-profit corporation. Homeowner associations have the same rights and powers as corporations. Like a corporation, under the North Carolina Planned Community Act, the homeowner association must elect an executive board. Under the bylaws the community members are required to set the number of board members, qualifications, and process by which to amend bylaws among many others. The executive board serves as the voice for the community in matters such as transactions pertaining to the common areas, enforcement of rules, and collection of assessments. Overall, Article III, and similar segments of laws from other states, has served as one of the many mechanisms in which homeowner associations have usurped local municipal governments as the preferred government of middle class residents. Assessment The passage of the North Carolina Planned Community Act illustrates the growing power homeowner associations have gained throughout the year. The state law expresses the state's power over the homeowner association. It even describes certain practices in which it must submit to the authority of the county. Nowhere in the statute, does it mention the homeowner association's obligation to the municipality, essentially meaning that the state is allowing the corporation to operate as its own municipality.

It governs migrant workers housing through regulations of housing inspections, standards to be met, and recognition of housing that meets all standards and requirements after the pre-occupancy inspection is done by the North Carolina Department of Labor (NCDOL) and the local county health department. Its goal is to ensure safe and healthy migrant housing conditions. Background Migrant workers can be defined as people who come from their home country to the United States legally, typically with limited benefits, to work in a variety of industries such as furniture, agriculture, and construction. An H-2A visa allows a foreign national entry into the U.S. for temporary or seasonal agricultural work. Typically, migrant workers make low wages, have limited access to healthcare and other medical facilities, and work for extremely long periods of time in extreme and often hazardous conditions. North Carolina is a state that thrives off of farmworker labor as it is home to Christmas tree farms, tomato farms, poultry factories, and tobacco fields.http://www.nclabor.com/ash/ash_blue_book.pdf In 1983, the United States Department of Labor passed the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act that regulated many aspects of migrant workers housing and working conditions. Section 203, \\"Safety and Health of Housing,\\" focused on the properties and their conditions that migrant workers lived on. The Migrant Housing Act of North Carolina (S.B. 631) was ratified in 1989 and implemented in 1990, and established certain requirements for employers who employed and housed migrant workers, such as required housing inspections and standards.http://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/byarticle/chapter_95/article_19.html Since then, the N.C. Department of Labor has conducted an annual housing registration, inspection and compliance program. The Act also requires that if a grower/owner provides housing to one or more migrant workers on a seasonal basis, then they are covered by the act except for housing in commercial lodging, such as a motel, or if the housing is owner-occupied.Introduction to Migrant Housing Standards The NCDOL Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau conducts pre-occupancy inspections of migrant housing. Housing must meet occupational safety and health standards and specific standards for heat, fire protection and kitchen sanitation. Migrant housing should be registered at least 45 days prior to occupancy. Housing that does not meet the standards can result in fines and abatement requirements for the owners.http://www.nclabor.com/ash/ash.htm Policy process and enacting legislation The policy formulation officially began in 1986 when advocates of stricter regulations began raising their voices and concerns about the impact of housing standards on migrant workers. =House of Representatives bill= S.B. 631 was introduced to the North Carolina House of Representatives for the first time on April 21, 1989 as, \\"An act to consolidate the regulation of migrant housing within the Department of Labor and to establish standards and enforcement provisions for the regulation of migrant housing.\\" The bill was referred to the Committee on Commerce.North Carolina House Journal. (1990). Retrieved various parts pertaining to S. B. 631 (p. 442, p. 644). On May 8, S.B. 631 was enrolled and duly ratified, and then sent to the office of the Secretary of State/North Carolina General Assembly. The bill at this point was also being referred to as \\"Chapter 91\\".North Carolina Senate Journal. (1990). Retrieved various parts pertaining to S. B. 631 (p. 221, p. 488). =Senate bill= On March 23, S.B. 631 was addressed in North Carolina Senate and referred to Agriculture Committee and re-referred to Manufacturing and Labor Committee and Appropriations Committee. Senator Speed sponsored S.B. 631 in Senate. April 17 marked the date of the completion of the N.C. General Assembly Legislative Fiscal Note, written and prepared by Legislator Carol Shaw and sponsored by Senator Speed. The fiscal note provided great detail to the fiscal responsibilities of the S.B. 631, especially the reorganization of the added employees within the Department of Labor to assist in migrant inspections. On May 8, Senate enrolled S.B. 631 and it was duly ratified and sent to the office of the Secretary of State. In addition to the Migrant Housing Act of North Carolina, the NCDOL Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau enforces the Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Agriculture, 29 CFR 1928.http://www.nclabor.com/ash/publications/ASH_Standards.pdf The N.C. General Assembly amended the Migrant Housing Act in 2007 to require owners and operators of migrant housing to provide migrant workers a bed with \\"a mattress in good repair with a clean cover\\" and to add additional regulatory and reporting requirements for the Department of Labor. Funding the legislation also sparked debate due to the nature of the work and the large territory that must be accounted for. When S.B. 631 was passed, $278,638 was appropriated for the remainder of fiscal year 1989-1990, and then $493,154 was appropriated for fiscal year 1990-1991. This budget included salaries for director, secretary, clerk, field supervisor, and 10 migrant inspectors, as well as benefits and other costs that come with operating a business or organizationShaw, L. C. (1989). North carolina general assembly legislative fiscal note: \\"Migrant housing law changes\\". About the law People who provide housing to one or more migrants employed in agriculture on a seasonal basis are covered by the Migrant Housing Act of North Carolina. People who own housing used by migrants (whether their employees or not) or who make arrangements to use someone else's property to house migrant employees must make sure that the housing meets the standards and that the N.C. Department of Labor is notified prior to the migrants moving in. The law excludes from coverage commercial lodging, such as motels open to the general public, and owner-occupied homes. The law covers any other housing in which migrants live‚Äîeven if that housing is occupied year-round by other farmworkers. The law extends to migrants working in crab processing facilities and migrants cultivating and harvesting Christmas trees. People covered under the act must register the housing with the N.C. Department of Labor's Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau 45 days before the migrants' arrival date. The Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau will do a preoccupancy inspection of the housing. Water and sewage inspections have to be done by the county health department before the Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau will do its preoccupancy inspection. If the housing meets all of the requirements, the NCDOL inspector will issue a certificate allowing the housing to be used. If the housing does not meet all of the requirements, the inspector will note what must be fixed. The inspector may have to return to do another inspection before migrants are allowed to move in. In 2009, the Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau completed 1,367 preoccupancy housing inspections of migrant farmworker housing and 68 compliance inspections. Certificates were issued to 1,285 sites with total occupancy (beds) of 14,442. There were 799 sites in 100 percent compliance at time of inspection.http://www.nclabor.com/news/2009_Annual_Report.pdf Gold Star Growers The Gold Star Grower program recognizes growers who house or are responsible for housing migrant workers that meet all of the requirements stated in the Migrant Housing Act of N.C. at the time of inspection from the DOL and the county's health department. If this process is done two years in a row, the Gold Star Grower could be nominated to display a Gold Star Grower's flag at the housing site. The flag is considered an award from the DOL and shows the grower is committed to safe, well-maintained housing for his/her workers. This nomination process all includes site visits during occupancy, interviews (with grower and/or tenants), and pesticide training for grower and workers.Gold Star Grower Program Standards to be ensured compliant before occupancy The following standards must be met before occupancy can occur. These standards will be inspected by the NCDOL and the county's health department, and could be inspected by the federal Wage & Hour Division, if necessary.

General duty: The law requires migrant housing operators to provide housing \\"free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious injury or serious physical harm.\\" See N.C. Gen. Stat. ¬ß 95-129(1). Findings According to the Center for Worker Health at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, 27 camps (non-H2A resident camps) were inspected in 2008. All 27 camps had at least one NCDOL housing violation; 41% had 6-10 violations, 18% had 11-16 violations, and 26% had 3-5 violations. The most common violations include no resident trained in First Aid and trash cans were missing a lid. Other major violations that occurred frequently include insufficient space in bedrooms, insufficient laundry facilities, and rodent infestation. The Center for Worker Health states that possible explanations for these violations include that the housing exceeds capacity for which it was certified by the NCDOL, employers fail to properly maintain the camps post-inspection, and that inspections are prioritized for H2A-residential camps. Recommendations by the Center for Worker Health include increased number of inspectors and post-occupancy inspections, as well as expand efforts to identify and inspect unregistered camps.Center for Worker Health.

Among the changes included adding a requirement that housing providers furnish a bed with a mattress and a mattress cover. Other recommendations included: requiring 1 telephone per camp, 1 washer and dryer per 30 workers, 1 showerhead per 5 workers, 1 toilet per 10 people & 1 urinal per 15 men, the right to visitors, compliance language referencing both growers and crewleaders in the law, and regulatory post-occupancy inspections for camps who have not met regulations during pre-occupancy inspections.FAN's Recommendations to Improve MHA.

Senator Alberton introduced SB 1466 and Representative Alexander introduced HB 1501 and HB 1502 in 2006.SAF-Unite. Website: http://www.saf-unite.org/migranthousing/migranthousingslide2.htm Specifically, the new law reads, \\"Each migrant shall be provided with a bed that shall include a mattress in good repair with a clean cover.\\" According to NCDOL's commissioner, Cherie K. Berry the written nature of the new law has created confusion as to what a \\"mattress\\" and \\"cover\\" is, therefore specifics have been outlined for growers to use as a guide when determining what constitutes as a mattress.S.B. 1466, Mattress Requirements, Website: Another change to the law requires the inspectors to provide operators with a copy of a guide for employers on compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act published by the U.S. Department of Justice. The NCDOL has also expressed three recommendations that they are working on to improve housing conditions for migrant workers. Their three goals are to: scout each season for unregistered camps, issue citations and penalties for nonregistered camps for noncompliance, and lastly, to ensure that crew leaders are educated on housing standards and that they are complying with the law.Website: http://www.nclabor.com/ash/ash_blue_book.pdf References External links Category:North Carolina law north carolina ","title":"Migrant Housing Act of North Carolina"},{"id":"30551756","text":"Roman Frydman (born February 29, 1948) is an American, Polish born economist at New York University and the author of more than ten books treating macroeconomic theory and privatization.

Health network surveillance addresses the rapidly increasing trend of electronic health records (EHR) and its incompatibility with information security practices that ‚Äòlock down‚Äô access through methods such as: modern firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention devices, and anti-virus and end-point protections.For a discussion of these issues see G. Griener at the University of Alberta Law School. From a physician‚Äôs perspective see Eli Finkelstein, MD and PhD, Electronic Health Records: The Threat to Privacy, For Us Docs. In contrast to restrictive security measures, health network surveillance runs in the background of networks through a combination of hardware and software devices that allow for real time monitoring that do not impede the day-to-day health care operations that make up healthcare systems and deliver essential services to patients and clients. Surveillance, in this context, means tracking the connections that are made between computers. These connections can be between computers within a health network or from a computer outside the health network. Effectively, this approach has the capacity to provide additional assurance that standard protective devices and approaches are working. Governments at all levels have increased legislation and regulation of the ways health information should be handled, for both public and private health organizations in many countries. Major regulatory bodies and legislation in Canada and the United States include but are not limited to: the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), PCI Security Standards Council, and Canada Health Infoway.As one exhaustive sample among many, see Canada Health Infoway, ‚ÄúElectronic Health Record (EHR) Privacy and Security Requirements‚Äù, www.infoway-inforoute.ca The provisions in all of the extent regulations track closely the security provisions of ISO 27000. Health network surveillance is able to address the increasingly complex legislation, regulations and policies imposed on health organizations in a way that restrictive security measures can only reduce the service levels of these organizations. Health network surveillance also has a proactive impact by providing business intelligence and network monitoring that can improve a health organization‚Äôs efficiency and effectiveness through real time information that can support decision making about network architecture, business processes and resource allocation. Two approaches enable the development of health network surveillance tools. Commonly used flow measures based on a number of flow protocols available on the market use the capacity of routers and switches to provide data regarding the functioning of networks.IP Flow Information Export An alternative to the use of flow protocols is connection tracking. Netfilter Connection Tracking The use of connection tracking works to record every connection between devices in a monitored network. There may be advantages in connection tracking techniques as they avoid sampling, produce more data in real time and put less load on the functioning of networks.

History The Parish of St. Peter is the third oldest parish in the Bridgeport diocese, founded in 1851.Church of St. Peter website, accessed January 23, 2011 The first recorded Catholic service conducted in Danbury occurred in 1845, when Rev. Michael Lynch, of St. James in Bridgeport said Mass in the home of James Doyle of Grassy Plains. Lynch then attended Danbury on a quarterly basis. For a time, services were held in various locations: the home of James Croal on Deer Hill, the Union Hall on Main Street, and Erwins's academy. O'Donnell, James H., History of the Diocese of Hartford, D. H. Hurd Company, 1900, p. 266 In 1851, Rev. Thomas Ryan secured the use of the Courthouse for a brief period prior to purchasing the former Universalist church building at Main and Wooster. The sale was handled discreetly so as not to arouse the opposition of the local Know Nothings. Ryan was succeeded as pastor by Rev. Michael O'Farrell, who arranged the purchase of the cemetery. Rev. Thomas Drea was pastor in 1858 and had responsibility for missions in Brookfield, New Fairfield, Newtown, Redding Ridge, and Ridgefield. In 1860, Rev. Ambrose Manahan D.D. purchased the Congregationalist Church and had it renovated for use. He was succeeded by Father Sheridan after whom a street in Danbury is named. It was Sheridan who commenced the building of St. Peter's Church.

Burr printing house, 1896, p. 327 The cornerstone of St. Peter's Church was laid on August 28, 1870 by Bishop Francis Patrick McFarland of Hartford. Work was interrupted by the Panic of 1873, but resumed the following year under Rev. John Quinn. The Gothic Revival building was dedicated in January 1876. In December 1886, Rev. Henry J. Lynch became Rector. Henry Lynch purchased the land for the second St. Peter's cemetery. The church was completed with the addition of the spire. A chime of bells was donated by the ladies of the parish. St. Peter's is the fifth oldest Roman Catholic Church in the Diocese of Bridgeport.FitzGerald, Eileen. \\"St. Peter's Church continues its legacy\\", Newstimes, October 13, 2010 As the first Catholic church built in northern Fairfield County, St. Peter's drew parishioners from the surrounding towns, many of whom walked a considerable distance to Sunday Mass, at a time when the Eucharistic fast began at midnight. In 1896 a parish library was created on the third floor of the convent through a generous donation by Mrs. J.H. Benedict. The Temperance Society Band became St. Peter's Band and played summer concerts in Elmwood Park.Connecticut Irish-American Heritage Trail Architecture The church was designed by the firm of Keely and Murphy. James Murphy would later design the first St. Mary Church in nearby Bethel, Connecticut. There are three entrances in the fa√ßade set into polychrome Gothic porches. Above each entrance are stained glass windows in Gothic arches. The church's stained glass was produced in Munich, Germany, supplied by the Royal Bavarian Art Institute and the F. X. Zettler Company. The 1870 church and its associated buildings are significant contributing properties of the Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut) of the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and is the Mother Church for the Roman Catholic communities of Danbury, Bethel, Redding, Ridgefield and Georgetown. Present day In 1900, the congregation of 6,000 was predominately Irish, with Germans, Italians, Hungarians, French, Poles, and Slavs. Danbury's annual St. Patrick's Day Parade steps off at St. Peter's Church. In recent years the parish has welcomed a number of Brazilian and Latino Catholics who have settled in Danbury. There is a Mass offered in Spanish on Sunday evenings, and one in Portuguese on both Saturday and Sunday.St. Peter Catholic Church School A school was opened in 1885,Danbury Historical Society (2001), Danbury, Arcadia Publishing Company.

It was written by co-executive producer Jack Burditt and directed by Tricia Brock. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 20, 2011. Guest stars in this episode include Meng Ai, Jean Brassard, Todd Buonopane, Tituss Burgess, Cheyenne Jackson, Chris Parnell, and Sherri Shepherd. In the episode, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) staff are affected by budget cuts at NBC. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) married his girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) but following the wedding, he learns that the minister (Brassard) did not marry the two of them. At the same time, TGS star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) shares a dressing room with her co-star Danny Baker (Jackson), and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has a health scare. Before the airing, NBC moved the program to a new timeslot at 10:00 p.m., moving it from its 8:30 p.m. slot that began in the beginning of the fifth season. This episode of 30 Rock was universally well received among television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" was watched by 5.338 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.7 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) married his girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) in the French Caribbean over New Year's. However, when he returns to New York following the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. As a result of what Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. Jack informs Liz that the minister married the two of them instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the its new parent company, Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the show its lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met. Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) dressing room is now a temporary room for a technician (Meng Ai) as Jack is renting space on the TGS floor in the 30 Rock building to keep the budget down, as a result Jenna is forced to share a dressing room with her TGS co-star Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson). Immediately, the two start behaving like an old married couple. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gets upset about Jenna and Danny fighting and decides to stop their bickering. Kenneth interrupts one of their arguments by showing them a childish picture he drew of the two. This works to no avail as Jenna and Danny continue arguing. To put a stop to this, Danny moves out from his dressing room and into the Y. At the same time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is informed by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned on whether or not their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses‚Äîeven admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5 million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget. Production Sherri Shepherd guest starred in \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" as Angie Jordan This episode of 30 Rock was written by co-executive producer Jack Burditt, his second episode for the fifth season, and his fourteenth writing credit after \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\", \\"The Baby Show\\", \\"The Fighting Irish\\", \\"Cleveland\\", \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"Subway Hero\\", \\"Sandwich Day\\", \\"The One with the Cast of Night Court\\", \\"St. Valentine's Day\\", \\"The Ones\\", \\"Kidney Now!\\", \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\", and \\"Let's Stay Together\\". The episode was directed by Tricia Brock, making it her second for the series after directing the March 19, 2009, episode \\"The Bubble\\" from the show's third season. \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" originally aired in the United States on January 20, 2011, on NBC as the eleventh episode of the show's fifth season and the 91st overall episode of the series. The episode featured several appearances by several frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan the wife of Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character \\"will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior.\\" This is evident in the following episode \\"Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning\\". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, \\"We're hoping to, maybe, if we can get away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock.\\" In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan‚Äîplayed by Tracy Morgan‚Äîthat he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as a way to deal with Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure. In the episode, it is revealed that Jack Donaghy accidentally married Liz Lemon instead of his girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net, while Avery wore a black cocktail dress. As a result of what Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. The two decide to get a divorce, however, they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another. Ultimately, Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce. Since beginning, the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic relationship between the two characters. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, Fey said that one of the plots that 30 Rock will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. \\"Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together.\\" Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook-up, he responded \\"I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way. Once they cross that line, all the tension goes out of those relationships. And I think the lesson we learned about both those characters is that they are married to their jobs and they are married to their work.\\" Cultural references Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy that he is dating Squeaky Fromme and says that she is a handful. Fromme is a member of the Manson Family, and was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible). Later, Jack gives Angie a reality show that will feature her friends and family. The show is a parody of the reality show The Real Housewives of... which airs on the cable network Bravo and follows the lives of relatively affluent, bourgeois housewives and professional women in the suburban or urban areas of several American cities. During the press conference, in which Liz announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5 million to \\"a high school for drama, the arts, and feelings\\", Liz spoke as socialite Edith Bouvier Beale. Later, Jack asks Liz what that voice was with Liz responding that that was \\"Drew Barrymore's impression of that crazy lady\\", a reference to actress Drew Barrymore who portrayed Beale in the 2009 HBO film Grey Gardens. Reception =Ratings= Before the airing of this episode, NBC unveiled its 2010‚Äì11 primetime schedule in May 2010 with the network moving 30 Rock from the 9:30 p.m. time to the 8:30 p.m. timeslot for the show's fifth season. In November 2010, it was announced that the program would move from 8:30 to the 10:00 timeslot. The network moved 30 Rock to the 10:00 time in order to \\"make room\\" for the return of the comedy show Parks and Recreation and the debut of the new comedy Perfect Couples. Many questioned whether or not it was a good decision to move the show to 10:00 as it is a low rated show. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" was watched by 5.338 million households in its original American broadcast. According to New York magazine the staff were most worried about how 30 Rock and Community‚Äîanother program that airs on NBC's Thursday lineup‚Äîwould do in the new time change but said that both shows \\"did great.\\" The episode earned a 2.7 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" was up nearly 30 percent against the previous episode, \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\", that aired at 8:30 p.m. on December 9, 2010. =Reviews= The A.V. Clubs Zack Handlen noted that the Jack and Liz being married plot \\"was strong enough to carry the episode overall, as watching Liz drive Jack crazy is almost always entertaining.\\" Handlen did not enjoy the other two stories from the episode, citing that Jenna and Danny's \\"had some good lines\\" and that it was good to see these two characters play off each other but \\"this really needed to get a lot crazier, or else have some sort of character development\\", and that the third plot was only worth towards the opening credits to Angie's reality show. \\"This was hilarious ... but everything else was like watching echoes of old gags. [...] There wasn't a lot of connective tissue to hold any of this together, so it came across as haphazard.\\" Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that this was a \\"fine episode about marriage and mistranslation.\\" Weiner, however, opined that the portrayal of Angie Jordan here, played by Sherri Shepherd, \\"was less than ideal.\\" Alan Sepinwall from HitFix wrote that the show is having a strong season with its fifth season but wrote that this episode was not a particularly strong one nonetheless \\"the writers can almost always rely on the Jack/Liz relationship for both heart ... and comedy. It was the first part of the episode that made me consistently laugh, and it also worked because I like Jack and Liz ‚Äì and like that the show remains committed to a complete lack of romantic tension between them\\". TV Guides Matt Roush was glad that Chris Parnell returned as his 30 Rock character in this episode. Ian McDonald of Zap2it wrote that the Jeffrey character \\"made one of the best in-jokes of the episode, recapping (and misinterpreting) Liz and Jack's 'will they/won't they chemistry.' The kicker, though, was we're meant to realize that Liz and Jack are perfect for each other in a completely platonic way.\\" McDonald was positive about Jane Krakowski and Cheyenne Jackson's subplot, saying it was nice to see them share a story, and that their characters \\"have great, toxic chemistry.\\" Bob Sassone of TV Squad said that the ending in which the Jeffrey character summarized Jack and Liz's friendship \\"was a perfect summation of the heart of 30 Rock itself.\\" IGN contributor Matt Fowler commented that the Jenna and Danny story \\"felt weak\\" but that Angie getting her own show \\"more than made up for it.\\" Fowler gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student commented that \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" had a \\"solid comeback\\", while Entertainment Weeklys Breia Brissey was glad that the show returned. \\"The strength of ['Mrs. Donaghy'] was that, however silly, all of the illogical circumstances of the show can be explained with a bit of reason\\", reported Caitlin Smith of The Atlantic. Smith said her favorite scene was when Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with Jeffrey, and \\"[h]e's counseling the newly married couple to avoid bringing their personal relationship into work and reads off a lengthy checklist of things to avoid.\\" Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times explained that the reason the series is having a strong season is due to it returning to the basics with the Jack and Liz friendship; \\"Somehow, Liz and Jack are such a perfect, if unexpected, pair that this theme manages not to wear thin. Their accidental marriage ... was almost inevitable, the logical end to which the writers could stretch the relationship. It does make you wonder what the writers can possibly do next, but I have faith.\\" New York magazine's Willa Paskin enjoyed Tina Fey's impression of Edith Bouvier Beale during her press conference. Elliott Hammer of The Collegian wrote that Angie's tagline for her reality show \\"I'm Angie and I think elegance and attitude are the same thing\\" was brilliant. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic commented that \\"[t]here were moments when I laughed\\" but that \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\" did not come together to make a great episode. He noted that Jack and Liz discovering that they were married \\"didn't bring much new to the table. Jack and Liz arguing like this is standard for 30 Rock, and I got bored of their story rather quickly.\\" Further in his recap, Forcella said that the ending scene, with Jeffrey explaining all of the things Jack and Liz have done together as close friends, \\"was almost as if they expected us to predict one of them was going to think it was something more than a friendship, and then flip it on the audience.\\" Kelsea Stahler of the New York Post noted that when it was revealed that Jack accidentally married Liz that it \\"fell a little flat\\", reasoning \\"I mean, Jack accidentally married [Liz], this scene could have reached so many levels of insanity, but instead they settled for Jonathan's (Maulik Pancholy) piercing squeal before moving onto the rest of the show.\\" Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline did not enjoy the Jenna, Danny, and Kenneth plot explaining that it unfolded \\"very strangely, and eventually saps a good deal of energy out of the show. It's a dead-end sub-plot that's simply useless.\\" Firecloud gave this episode a 7 out of 10 rating.

It was written by executive producer Robert Carlock. The director of this episode was Beth McCarthy-Miller. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on January 27, 2011. Guest stars in this episode include Robert De Niro, Lester Holt, Sherri Shepherd, and Dean Winters. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) decides to pre-tape a celebrity benefit for a natural disaster, but his plan goes terribly wrong. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) continues to drive Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) crazy with his irresponsibility. However, when a reality show camera crew starts to follow Tracy around, Liz tries to use it to her advantage. \\"Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning\\" was universally well received and praised by television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 4.922 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.4 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot As it dawns on Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) that he's no longer a part of GE and now works for Kabletown, he decides to conquer this new phase in his life just as he did before. After researching, he finds that the most watched reality programs of the past five years are celebrity benefits for natural disasters. Since all the networks air benefits at the same time, no one network has an advantage nor dominates in the ratings. To combat this, Jack decides to pre-tape a benefit to air on the night of the next natural disaster. When a disaster devastates an island called Mago, Jack is ecstatic until he finds out that the island is owned by the infamous troubled actor, Mel Gibson. Regardless, the event is a success. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) pushes Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) buttons as usual by not showing up to rehearsals and leaving work to do something insane. However, Tracy's demeanor instantly changes when a camera crew starts to follow him around for his wife's new reality show. He starts to act responsible and respectful in front of the cameras, as not to ruin his chances of winning an Oscar. Liz has the idea to use Tracy's fake good behavior to get him to do things he blew off in the past, knowing that he can't refuse while taped. This works until Tracy finds a loophole. When Liz tries to get Tracy to do more things, he refuses and insults Liz to the melody of \\"Uptown Girl\\" by Billy Joel. Since the song is copyrighted, any footage containing that song can't be used. Therefore, Tracy's irresponsibility wouldn't be aired on the show. Liz tries to outcrazy him with autotune, but she later realizes that she can't match his insanity. They finally talk it out alone and each argue that the other person would have been a failure without their help. Cameras manage to film this nevertheless and Tracy and Liz refuse to make up. However, when the show edits their various confrontations and uses two look-alikes to create a make up scene along to the song \\"Secrets\\" by OneRepublic, both Liz and Tracy are moved to tears and make up for real. Cultural references This episode continues to depict the acquisition of NBC by Comcast. Liz tries to tell Jack what a Snart is (which is to sneeze and fart simultaneously) because it is ten o'clock. This refers 30 Rocks move from the 8:30 pm to the 10:00 pm timeslot. Tracy plans to get an island like Nicolas Cage, Celine Dion, and Charles Widmore, the latter being a fictional character from Lost. The whole cast of TGS is being filmed by the cameras of Angie Jordan's (wife of Tracy) new reality show, Queen of Jordan, which Jack commissioned in the previous episode, \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\". Eventually an episode of 30 Rock was filmed as an episode of \\"Queen of Jordan\\". The episode references the ongoing storyline of Liz's desire to become a mother when Kenneth gives Liz a memo he could not put in her mailbox because it was full of unread adoption materials. This story first began in the show's first season, and continued in the third season. Tracy and Liz fight in several ways, all of them involving masking their arguments in ways that cannot be used in the reality show for copyright reasons, such as singing along with the Billy Joel song \\"Uptown Girl\\" or wearing a New York Rangers goalie mask. Jack films a pre-taped disaster event special, which he uses when a hurricane strikes Mago Island, but this backfires because the only victims were island owner actor Mel Gibson, who was highly publicized for his personal troubles, and his guest, Jon Gosselin. While considering his new position as a Kabletown executive, Jack mentions \\"stout Cortez\\" and quotes the poem \\"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\\" by John Keats. Tracy later also mentions feeling like \\"Stout Cortez,\\" but this time in reference to his gardener. Reception According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning\\" was watched by 4.922million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.4 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\", which was watched by 5.338 million American viewers. It turned out to be the most-watched episode of the show until the series finale on January 31, 2013.

The nearest towns are Jeparit to the south and Rainbow to the north. After more than a decade of drought, in early 2011 the lake filled as a result of flooding in the region. The Wemba Wemba name for the lake is recorded as Gour or Koor.

Geography Lake Hindmarsh is the northernmost lake of the Wimmera River Terminal Wetlands, and receives water directly from the Wimmera River. When full, the lake covers , is deep and holds of water.Murray-Darling Basin Authority Archived from the original 2012-02-29. It is a wetland of national significance. On the rare occasions when Lake Hindmarsh overflows, water runs, via Outlet Creek, to the deeper Lake Albacutya, which has been recognised under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance. Flat and shallow, Lake Hindmarsh is subject to very high evaporation. When it is full, evaporation from the lake is around per year. With flows down the Wimmera River averaging only half of that, the lake rarely fills, although if it does so, the water takes three to four years to evaporate entirely. The lake was full during the wet years of the early to mid-1970s. It supported a commercial fishing industry and was a destination for tourism and water sports, with a water-skiing club having a membership of over 100. The lake filled again in 1996, but then received no further water from the Wimmera River, and had dried up by 2000. It remained dry for almost a decade. In October 2009, water from the Wimmera River trickled into Lake Hindmarsh for the first time in thirteen years. The 2010 Victorian floods of September raised lake water levels higher and triggered a revival of birdlife. The January 2011 Victorian floods in the Wimmera catchment raised hopes that the lake would fill, and possibly overflow into the lakes to the north. However, Outlet Creek remained dry.

Choson Exchange brings foreign volunteers to teach entrepreneurship, business, marketing, law or economics, after which the volunteers tour relevant sites in North Korea. They also sponsor North Koreans to go overseas for exposure and learning. Programs include economic policy, entrepreneurship and financial sector development. The organization brought over 100 foreign volunteers to train over 2000 North Koreans by 2018, brought over 100 Koreans to Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia for exposure and learning. Choson Exchange is the largest business network in North Korea and the most active organization training Koreans in economic areas. It has been profiled as a Harvard Business School case study and was cited by futurist Parag Khanna's book Connectography as \\"the most prominent international nongovernmental organization operating in North Korea\\". Some notable volunteers at programs include George Yeo, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade & Industry, and Information, Communications and the Arts for Singapore. Background Choson Exchange was founded by Geoffrey See, a Yale University and Wharton School graduate and MIT Researcher, who began negotiations over educational exchange with North Koreans in 2007. The organization focuses on providing ‚Äútraining and advisory in topics related to business, economics, finance and law‚Äù in North Korea. Current projects Choson Exchange brings volunteers to train DPR Koreans in Pyongyang, Pyongsong, Wonsan and Rason in economics, entrepreneurship and business and also conducts training programs overseas to provide Koreans with greater exposure to the world. Workshop leaders volunteer in their private capacity, and previous trainings have featured the ex-Finance Minister of Singapore, ex-Chairman of Singapore International Airlines, bankers from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch as well as big-four consultancies, major tech companies and startups. Choson Exchange workshop fall into two main tracks, one focused on business and management skills, the other on broader economic management issues. Major programs in these fields include the Women in Business program, aimed at supporting female entrepreneurs and managers and the Provincial Development Program, focused on the governance of DPRK Special Economic Zones. The organization also supports young North Koreans with internships and scholarships for longer, master's-level study programs. Choson Exchange compiles and distributes economic and business materials in various formats for audiences in North Korea. The non-profit is also working on establishing an incubator in North Korea. The founder is a member of the Kauffman Fellows Program, a leadership program for venture capitalists and those involved in building out entrepreneurial ecosystems. 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit In 2018, the Washington Post cited Choson Exchange's work bringing North Koreans to Singapore as one among a number of reasons why Singapore was chosen as the site of the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit between the leaders of the United States and DPRK, Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un. The Washington Post also noted that Kim Jong Un's tour around Singapore's Marina Bay, during which he praised Singapore's development, was exactly the same route in which more than 100 of Choson Exchange's North Korean participants had taken in the past when they visit Singapore. Singapore-South Korea Relations In 2018, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon visited Singapore and expressed appreciation for Choson Exchange's work introducing economic policy, business and entrepreneurship to DPR Koreans. After the meeting, Mayor Park told South Korean media that Seoul should initiate startup exchanges with North Korea, with the work of Choson Exchange as a reference for what is possible and should be done. Later that year, Choson Exchange was represented at the State Dinner between President Halimah Yacob and President Moon Jae-in during a State Visit to Singapore. Research and Outreach Choson Exchange studies and reports on changes in North Korea's economic policy and investment laws for an international audience. Choson Exchange staff also provide analysis on political or social events, particularly as they relate to the economic life of the DPRK.

Lynch (1916‚Äì1981) was the former athletic director and basketball coach at St. Francis College. Lynch was also a noted public speaker, regularly addressing civic and sports groups. Lynch was often referred to as, The Smiling Irishman. Biography Daniel Lynch graduated from St. Francis College in 1938. He played on the College's basketball team from 1934‚Äì1938 and was the team's Captain. Lynch then went on to become the basketball head coach at his Alma Mater from 1948‚Äì1969. In 1964 he was appointed as the Athletic Director of St. Francis College, a post he held for eleven years, until 1975. One of Lynch's sons, Daniel Lynch Jr., also attended St. Francis College and is a graduate of the 1970 class. Lynch was one of the original proponents of the Three-point field goal. St. Francis College Lynch holds the St. Francis College record for most wins by a coach. During his tenure the Terriers men's basketball program experienced their best seasons. The greatest of which, was the 1955‚Äì56 season. The Terriers compiled a 21‚Äì4 record, were ranked as high as 13th nationally and upset Niagara University to reach the NIT semi-finals before they were defeated. From 1948 to 1952 the Terriers participated in 4 National Catholic Invitational Tournaments (NCIT). The NCIT was a premier post-season tournament at that time. The Terriers went to the NCIT finals three consecutive times and won the Championship in 1951. Lynch's 1950‚Äì51 squad defeated the Seattle University Redhawks 93‚Äì79 in the Championship game. From 1953 to 1969, Lynch guided the Terriers to 3 NIT appearances and 3 Conference Regular Season Championships. Lynch coached many great players like Al Innis and Jim Luisi and during his tenure had 7 players drafted by the NBA. Lynch was also a large supporter of the Terriers having their own basketball court. Prior to building the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex in 1971, the Terriers for 21 seasons did not have a home court of their own. They played at the 14th Regiment Armory, the 69th Regiment Armory, and at times the Bishop Ford High School gymnasium.

As in high dynamic range imaging (HDRI or just HDR), the goal is to capture a scene with a higher dynamic range than the camera is capable of capturing with a single exposure.  Technique  By using different exposure parameters on the same scene, a wider dynamic range can be represented and later merged into an image with better dynamic range. After correcting for small shifts that may inadvently happen with hand-held devices, the full-image can be fused in two ways: * A higher dynamic range raw image can be reassembled and tone-mapped like usual HDR images, or more commonly: * A blended image can be directly produced without reconstructing a higher bit-depth. The former method assumes a linear response from the camera, which may be provided by DNG or other raw formats. Some variants can take developed images, but the process of reconstructing the intensities is complicated and noisy, compromising the effective dynamic range. The latter method [Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth (MKVr)] only cares about aligning features and taking the best parts, automatically (by contrast, saturation, and well-exposedness) or manually, so it is immune to this drawback. However, it cannot be considered a true HDR technique because no HDR image is ever created. The image does look better on displays, but the resulting bit depth of the image is equal to the input depth, unlike on a true HDR image where a greater bit depth allows storing more detailed intensity changes. Flexibility being its strength, this method can be extended to perform focus stacking by using contrast as the sole criteria. = In photomicrography = In photomicrography, the exposure fusion is often the only way how to acquire properly exposed images from stereomicroscopes. One of the software solutions designed for photomicrography is the HDR module for QuickPHOTO microscopy software. This module can be also combined with Deep Focus focus stacking module to solve another problem, which is shallow depth of field of stereomicroscopes.

Gray, New York; Novello, London  Life  He was born in Pest His father was a landowner and his mother was a descendant of the poet Istv√°n Gy√∂ngy√∂si. His father joined the revolutionary party, and suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his estates. The youth turned his attention to music, studying piano with Moronyi and composition with Robert Volkmann.Enciclop√®dia Espasa, Appendix No. 6, pp. 848-849 At nineteen, he found himself in possession of a robust tenor voice. He studied voice with Gustave-Hippolyte Roger, and in 1868 he made his operatic debut at the National Theatre of Budapest. But the strain was too great, and eventually he abandoned this career and applied himself to pianoforte study under his godfather Franz Liszt, of whose music he became a well-known interpreter. He went to England in 1871, but finding insufficient support, he went to New York and toured in the United States with the German tenor, Theodor Wachtel (1823 - 1893). He ultimately established himself as a professor of singing in New York. Brooklyn born soprano Susan Strong (August 3, 1870 - London: March 11, 1946) and British soprano Lillian Henschel (1860 ‚Äì 1901) were among his pupils. He had not neglected his singing abilities entirely and from time to time sang in recitals. In 1874, Korbay returned to London, and soon established a teaching connection. In 1894, he became a professor at the Royal College of Music, and remained in that position until 1903. He had many successful European tours, and was also extremely popular in England. Korbay wrote many pianoforte pieces and songs, but he was best known by his collections of Magyar folk songs, which attained a very wide popularity, among which Mohac's Field may be mentioned in particular.Mohac's Field He died in London, which for many years was his home, March 9, 1913.

It is usually enumerated in terms of the Sun's mass as a proportion of a solar mass (). Hence, the bright star Sirius has around . A star's mass will vary over its lifetime as mass is lost with the stellar wind or ejected via pulsational behavior, or if additional mass is accreted, such as from a companion star. Properties Stars are sometimes grouped by mass based upon their evolutionary behavior as they approach the end of their nuclear fusion lifetimes. Very-low-mass stars with masses below 0.5 do not enter the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) but evolve directly into white dwarfs. (At least in theory; the lifetimes of such stars are long enough‚Äîlonger than the age of the universe to date‚Äîthat none has yet had time to evolve to this point and be observed.) Low-mass stars with a mass below about 1.8‚Äì2.2 (depending on composition) do enter the AGB, where they develop a degenerate helium core. Intermediate-mass stars undergo helium fusion and develop a degenerate carbon‚Äìoxygen core. Massive stars have a minimum mass of 5‚Äì10 . These stars undergo carbon fusion, with their lives ending in a core-collapse supernova explosion. Black holes created as a result of a stellar collapse are termed stellar-mass black holes. The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines. Range One of the most massive stars known is Eta Carinae, with ; its lifespan is very short‚Äîonly several million years at most. A study of the Arches Cluster suggests that is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe. The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the Eddington luminosity which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space. However, a star named R136a1 in the RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 315 , putting this limit into question. A study has determined that stars larger than 150 in R136 were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems, providing a way to sidestep the 150 limit.LiveScience.com, \\"Mystery of the 'Monster Stars' Solved: It Was a Monster Mash\\", Natalie Wolchover, 7 August 2012 The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 or more, due to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition. This generation of supermassive, population III stars is long extinct, however, and currently only theoretical. With a mass only 93 times that of Jupiter (), or .09 , AB Doradus C, a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. For stars with similar metallicity to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have, and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 . When the metallicity is very low, however, a recent study of the faintest stars found that the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 . Smaller bodies are called brown dwarfs, which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants. Change The Sun is losing mass from the emission of electromagnetic energy and by the ejection of matter with the solar wind. It is expelling about per year. The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the red giant stage, climbing to y‚àí1 when it reaches the tip of the red-giant branch. This will rise to y‚àí1 on the asymptotic giant branch, before peaking at a rate of 10‚àí5 to 10‚àí4 y‚àí1 as the Sun generates a planetary nebula. By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate white dwarf, it will have lost 46% of its starting mass.

Features  The Sansa c200 series can play MP3, WMA, and WAV audio files and reads audio file tags to display song information such as album, artist, title and album art. c200 series players automatically sort music files into a library by tag users can browse their music by artist, album, track, genre, or year. Version 2 of the c200 firmware also supports Audible's .AA format. The player also allows users to shuffle music playlists as well as create their own. C200 series players support viewing image files in either JPEG or bitmap format, and allow users to organize photos into albums and view photo slide-shows. The c200 series features a microphone built into one end of the player; users can make voice recordings that save as WAV files in the RECORD directory on the player. An FM radio is built into the c200, the player uses the headphones as a radio antenna, so reception varies. Recordings can be made from the FM radio and are stored in the RECORD directory on the player. The c200 series features SanDisk's trademark micro SD card slot. A micro SD card up to 2 GB in capacity can be inserted into this slot on the c200 in order to increase the player's music storage limit. The battery is easily replaceable and requires no tools, allowing users to keep an extra battery and swap them out on the go.\\"SanDisk Sansa c200 Review\\", By Grahm Skee on November 26, 2006  Interface  The Proprietary USB connector used by the Sansa c200 series The graphical user interface (GUI) that comes pre-installed on Sansa c200 series players is fairly intuitive. All items on the player are organized into menus that scroll up and down. The c200 GUI is nearly identical to that of the Sansa e200 series, and uses most of the same icons. The control layout of the c200 is made up of a keypad on the right side of the player, a volume rocker on top, and record and hold switches on the bottom. The up and down buttons on the keypad allow the user to scroll through menus as one might expect, the square button in the center of the keypad is used to select menu items and the left button returns to the previous menu. =Transferring Media= C200 series players have a long rectangular port on the one end that connects to a proprietary plug on special USB 2.0 cables and power adapters. When the player is connected to a computer it will automatically enter the set USB mode. The Sansa c200 has two USB modes, MTP and MSC. In Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) mode music and photos can only be transferred to c200 series players via a media management program such as Windows Media Player or Winamp. When files are transferred to the player in MTP mode they are automatically organized by the media management software. USB Mass-storage Device Class (MSC) mode gives users more control over media on the c200 by allowing files on the player to be managed via a file manager such as Windows Explorer or Finder. MSC mode allows users to sort and tag files on the player however they see fit. Issues The display can be an issue on the c240 and c250. The 132x80 pixel resolution of the 1.4 inch display is sub-optimal for viewing photos, and watching video. The frame-rate is also incredibly low making very difficult to play any of the games that come with the c200 Rockbox build. The built-in voice recorder can only record in mono. The reception of the built-in FM radio can sometimes cut out due to the use as headphones as the antenna.

It was formerly developed by Sun Microsystems Laboratories, since renamed Oracle Labs. The emphasis in Maxine's software architecture is on modular design and code reuse for flexibility, configurability, and productivity for industrial and academic virtual machine researchers. It is one of a growing number of Java virtual machines written entirely in Java in a meta-circular style. Examples include Squawk and Jikes RVM. Architecture The Maxine VM is characterized internally by aggressive use of advanced language features in Java 1.5 and 1.6, by modular subsystems coordinated through Java interfaces, by the absence of an interpreter, and by a tightly coupled debugger and visualization tool for VM development. Compatibility Maxine is plug compatible with an unmodified Java Development Kit (JDK). Maxine can be developed, built, and run in standard Java integrated development environments (IDEs), including NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA. Systems programming in Java A secondary goal of the project is to develop methods and tools for \\"systems programming in Java\\". Compiler extensions, configured in VM source code using Java annotations, allow use, with no performance penalty, of low-level operations otherwise disallowed in Java. These extensions provided the foundation for the Graal compiler. The Maxine Inspector Specialized debugging support for the Maxine VM is provided by the Maxine Inspector: a companion tool that acts as a combined object, class, and method browser, and as a machine- and bytecode- level debugger. The Inspector runs out-of-process, needs no active VM support, and leverages code shared with the VM for specialized developer services that exploit detailed knowledge of memory layout and VM design. Notable services include: * multiple mode views of code (source, bytecode, disassembled machine code) with multi-mode breakpoints and stepping; * thread, stack, register, and thread local variable inspection; * flexible low-level memory visualization with dynamic interpretation and linking of memory values, e.g. as code locations, object references; * dynamic visualization of object fields and metadata; * boot image configuration details; and * specialized algorithm- specific support for debugging during GC. History Maxine was created by Bernd Mathiske at Sun Labs in early 2005. He led its development among a growing team until late 2008 when he left Sun Microsystems and handed the project over to Doug Simon who had been the first engineer to join it. Doug Simon continued in this role throughout the acquisition of Sun by Oracle Corporation. The static (heap inspection) version of the Maxine Inspector was created by Bernd Mathiske in 2006.

The dam forms long, narrow Loveland Reservoir which stores of water. It is operated primarily for flood control and municipal water storage in conjunction with downstream Sweetwater Dam but the reservoir is also open to the public for fishing. The dam stands high and spans across the narrow gorge of the Sweetwater River, south of Alpine. It is built entirely of concrete and has a thin arch design. Loveland is the younger of the two dams on the Sweetwater River; the other, Sweetwater, was built in 1888 while Loveland was only constructed in 1945. It is named after Chester H. Loveland, president of the California Water and Telephone Corporation, the firm that built it. The Loveland Reservoir is considered a better water storage facility than Sweetwater because of its much smaller surface area (454 acres compared to 960) and comparable capacity, thus it is less vulnerable to evaporation.

Filming was in 2007 and its world premiere was at the 2008 Pusan International Film Festival. It was released in South Korean theaters in 2009. Plot The sudden death of her mother brings Myung-eun back home to Jeju island. There she meets her estranged sister Myung-ju and Myung-ju's daughter Seung-ah, still living at their old home, and Hyun-ah who has lived with them for over 20 years like a relative. A career woman whose hard exterior masks her illegitimacy and abandonment issues, Myung-eun tells Hyun-ah she wants to start looking for her father after the funeral. Single-minded in her desire to dig up memories of her father and discover why he left, Myung-eun resents that Myung-ju, who like their mother is a carefree fish trader and an unmarried mother of a young daughter, seemingly doesn't care. At first Myung-ju is reluctant to accompany Myung-eun, but after Hyun-ah persuades her, guilt and her sense of duty as an older sibling prevails. And so the two sisters who are dissimilar in character, lifestyle and even fathers go on a road trip together. On their trip, Myung- eun and Myung-ju quarrel over their differences, share secrets, reminisce about their past, and eventually embrace each other as family. Director Boo Ji-young captures the delicately subtle atmosphere floating between women, and how inscrutable life is. Cast *Shin Mina ... Park Myung-eun *Gong Hyo-jin ...

He is notable for his excavation work at ƒê√¥ng S∆°n between 1935 and 1939. Though he originally argued a viewpoint for the European origins of Bronze Age culture in Vietnam, he reversed himself in support of Chinese origins after he started excavations at ƒê√¥ng S∆°n. Janse is characterized as having introduced order into the research of the history of archaeology in Mainland Southeast Asia. Early years Janse was the son of candy factory owner Thure Johan Janse and Hilma Wilhelmina Svensson. His uncle, Otto Janse, who was an archaeologist who specialized in Swedish medieval history, was an inspiration to Olov in choosing his field of study, archaeology. Olov also received inspiration from Ture Nerman. Nerman and his brothers, Birger and Ejnar, became lifelong friends with Olov. Stated the archaeologist Birger Nerman, \\"I soon grew tired of sweets, but got a friend for life.\\" Janse received his early education was at De Geer school in Norrk√∂ping. He graduated from Uppsala University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1916, a Master of Arts degree in 1920, and his doctorate in 1922 on the thesis Le travail de l'or en Su√®de √† l'√©poque m√©rovingienne. √âtudes pr√©c√©d√©es d'un m√©moire sur les solidi romains & byzantins trouv√©s en Su√®de. Career Between 1920 and 1930, he worked as an assistant curator at the National Archaeological Museum in Saint-Germain-en- Laye, France. He held the position of associate professor of national and prehistoric archaeology at the √âcole du Louvre during the period of 1925 to 1927, lectured as an associate professor from 1928 through 1936 at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes at the Sorbonne. He was appointed honorary professor at the University of Paris in 1934. His work alternated between Paris and Stockholm at different institutions. During the following years, Janse was director of the Archaeological Expedition to Indochina, composed of a research team of archaeologists and ethnologists who made important excavations in French Indochina. Janse used the practice of typology-based archaeology to his field of prehistoric research. He excavated the ƒê√¥ng S∆°n site, and other sites in Viet Nam over the course of three periods from November 1934 through November 1938. He also excavated Han and Tang Dynasty Chinese monuments and tombs, in fact, finding both Dong Son culture and Han- style brick tombs at the ƒê√¥ng S∆°n archaeological site. During his third excavation, he also spent time at the Sa Hu·ª≥nh sites in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province. While most of the ceramics that he unearthed during these excavations were deposited in various museums around the world, he gave some to King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, perhaps as a gesture of patriotism. During World War II, Janse went to the United States where he worked as an advisor to the U.S. intelligence agency, Office of Strategic Services. Janse became a professor of East Asian Archaeology at Harvard University in 1940, a position he held through 1943. Thereafter he worked at UNESCO, and then in Korea. His was influenced by Oscar Montelius, Johan Gunnar Andersson, and Henri Hubert. Personal life Janse was married to Renee Sokolsky (b. circa 1903, Russia; died 2000). She accompanied him on his scientific trips. In 1940, Janse and his wife settled in the United States, and in 1948 he became a U.S. citizen. At retirement, they lived in an upscale retirement home at 4000 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. where he died in 1985 after complications from a traffic accident. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities in 1961. Legacy In 2002, the antiquities donated by his widow, Renee Janse, became the Olov and Renee Jansen Memorial Fund. The Jansen East Asian collections held today include the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm, the Mus√©e Cernuschi in Paris, the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris, and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. The Bortom Synranden is a biographical research project regarding the work of Jansen. The Chinese ceramics that Janse collected in 1939 from the Malay Peninsula are in the National Museum of Singapore. Other collections of his cultural materials are housed at the Cernushi Museum, the Guimet Museum, the Louvre, the Museum of Art and History, and the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities.

The second novel is The Gate Thief and the third one is Gatefather. Overview Danny North knew from early childhood that his family was different, and that he was different from them. While his cousins were learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family, Danny worried that he would never show a talent, never form an outself. He grew up in the rambling old house, filled with dozens of cousins, and aunts and uncles, all ruled by his father. Their home was isolated in the mountains of western Virginia, far from town, far from schools, far from other people. There are many secrets in the House, and many rules that Danny must follow. There is a secret library with only a few dozen books, and none of them in English ‚Äî but Danny and his cousins are expected to become fluent in the language of the books. While Danny's cousins are free to create magic whenever they like, they must never do it where outsiders might see. Unfortunately, there are some secrets kept from Danny as well. And that will lead to disaster for the North family. Plot Danny, being the oldest person in the North family not to have developed any visible powers, is forced to work as a teacher and babysitter for younger kids with more magical power than him. One day, while trying to make his cousins focus on learning about their powers, he decides to take drastic measures. Wrapping their 'clants', creatures they create by channeling their wills, in a sack, he prevents them from leaving their clant bodies or from escaping the sack. He ties them in a tree to teach them a lesson, but is confronted by his outraged family. After everyone leaves, his favourite aunt, nicer than most of the family, tells him to retrieve the girls, and while climbing the tree for the second time, and more slowly, he discovers that he has created a magical gate while climbing the tree. The gate teleports him a short distance up the tree, healing his bruises at the same time. This is a forbidden type of magic he didn't expect to have. After returning the girls' clants, freeing them, he pretends not to know about his forbidden powers, and continues with his duties, knowing he is hunted. When Danny is thirteen, he and his family are inspected by the Argyros family, the Greeks. With them is a girl a year or so younger than Danny. The Norths try to act pathetic and weak, and later, while he is spying on the adults from both families, the twelve-year-old girl, Yllka, comes into the room and reveals him as a gatemage. While he is a Gatefather, the most powerful type, she seems to be nothing more than a Finder, who can only sense gates. When Danny escapes, he comes upon Thor, a relative, who informs him that the North family has suspected his skill, but promises not to try very hard to track Danny, while warning Danny that he should try to hide or Thor will be forced to capture him. Afterwards, Danny goes to a local Walmart, where even though he is observed by a detective, Danny makes off with decent clothes. Danny then encounters Eric, a teenager who begs and burglarizes houses, and they beg for money and rides until they get to Washington, DC. There, Danny and Eric find a house that belongs to a man named Stone ‚Äî a meadowfriend (a mage that specializes in growing flowers), Ced ‚Äî a windmage who can control the wind ‚Äî, and Ced's wife Lana (not a mage). Stone's talents with growing Westil flowers unconsciously leads mages to his house, where he evaluates their powers and determines if they will fit with a group of mages not associated with Families‚Äîcalled the Orphans. Shortly after entering, Danny is sexually assaulted by Lana, which makes Danny realize the consequences of not being able to use his gates in an emergency. Afterwards, Danny and Eric rob a house using Danny's gates to their advantage, only to find that out of all of the houses in the area, they chose the one which had already been robbed. Inside the cellar in the house, Danny finds a family tied up and left for dead, and the father has died. Danny calls the police afterward and is yelled at by Eric for calling the police whilst robbing a house. In order to repay Eric for taking care of him, Danny robs several houses by gating into them and passing the goods back through to Eric. The fence for the stolen goods, suspecting cops, breaks Erics ribs and attacks Danny. By manipulating his gates Danny incapacitates the fence, steals the money that they are \\"owed\\" and heals Eric. Instead of returning to Stones' house, Danny drops Eric off behind the Walmart where they met and gives Eric all the money they took from the fence. On the advice of Stone, Danny travels to Ohio and meets Leslie and Marion Silverman, Orphans who agree to train him and help to develop his gatemagery. Leslie is a beastmage with an affinity for cows, and Marion is an earthmage able to sense large deposits of oil and coal. After several months, Danny comes to see the Silverman's as his parents and things seem to be going well until a stranger appears out of one his gates. The stranger (Victoria Van Roth, aka Veevee) is actually an Orphan gatemage, but because she can't create a gate, has never seen one and no one believes her claims. On stumbling unto one of Danny's gates in DC, she becomes obsessed and follows the chain of gates she finds until she catches up to him in Ohio. Because she has acquired a large academic library of material on gatemages, she offers to learn and study with Danny. As Danny approaches his 16th birthday he convinces his guardians to let him attend high school, and he picks a school close to the North family that he used to watch in Virginia (Parry McCluer High School). Veevee is listed as his aunt, she rents an apartment in Buena Vista and Danny links it via gates to her condo in Florida. On the first day of school Danny quickly befriends Laurette, Sin, Xena, Pat, Hal and Wheeler, while antagonizing the track coach Coach Lieder. While helping Hal climb the rope in gym class, Danny inadvertently creates a series of gates throwing whoever climbs a rope a mile into the air, then landing them safely back on the ground. As the students begin to line up to \\"ride the rope\\", it becomes clear this is bad for Danny; he can't stop or close the gates, the media will pick up the story, he will be exposed to all the families and they will come hunting for him. However, after only a couple students have done the ride, the gates begin to stop working and become locked. Another gate mage is close and able to control his gates. Hoping it's Veevee, Danny nearly runs into the Greek gate mage (Yllka aka Hermia), but immediately gates away. As Hermia pursues Danny, she teaches him how to remove his gates, lock them and Danny comes to understand by helping him she has forfeited her place with her own family. She promises to help him build his Great Gate. The ability of Gatefathers to create gates connecting Earth to Westil (the mage home world) has been missing for 1400 years. Mages that make the trip find their powers exponentially magnified, but all the attempts to create these gates have failed since Loki stole all of them. Any Gatefather attempting it has lost their powers completely. Danny believes making the attempt is the only way he can be safe from the mage families, by controlling the access to Westil and making peace with them. By accident, when he helped Hal climb the rope he had stumbled on the process of creating a Great Gate. Gathering his friends: Stone, Veevee, Ced, Leslie, Marion and Hermia, Danny returns to the rope and creates his own Great Gate. The Gate Thief immediately attacks Danny as Leslie, Marion and Ced enter the gate. Danny is able to defeat the Gate Thief, but it leaves him paralyzed as he tries to control all the gates he has pulled from the Gate Thief. = Wad's Story = A secondary story interleaves throughout the book about a boy named Wad. In the remote part of Westil, a young man emerges from what seemed to be a man shaped tree, and stumbles around. Naked and unable (or unwilling to) speak, he is provided some food and clothes by a kind young woman. The young man makes his way to the castle in the country Iceward where he befriends a cook in the castle and is named Wad. For years Wad is the cooks helper. He speaks to few and constantly spies on everyone, finding unexplained passages to inaccessible places in the castle. His spying allows him to thwart an attempt on the unloved queen's life, and he becomes her lover. The queen becomes pregnant and convinces the King the child (named Oath) is his. The King learns to love his wife and pulls away from his mistress and their two sons. The Queen fearing that the mistresses illegitimate sons could challenge her son asks Wad to kill them. Instead of murdering them, Wad imprisons them beneath the castle. Eventually the Queen and the King conceive their own child. Wanting her claim to the throne to be completely legitimate, the Queen kills Oath, and attempts to murder Wad, the mistress and children in their prisons. As Wad is saving the mistress and children, Danny makes his Great Gate, causing Wad to remember his plans as the Gate Thief. His failed attempt to eat Danny's gate leaves him with the ability to only spawn a handful of gates. = Conclusion = Danny is able to master the gates he swallowed from the Gate Thief. Leslie and Marion return successfully from Westil but Ced has remained behind. Before they can leave the high school, Danny's family attacks him to demand access to the Great Gate. The powered up Leslie and Marion have no problems defeating them and making it clear that they will control access to the Great Gates only if Danny is obeyed and safe.

Sutphen was born in Philadelphia on 11 May 1861. His parents were the Rev. Morris Crater Sutphen and Eleanor (Brush) Sutphen. He went to Princeton University and graduated in 1882. Sutphen wrote several novels, the most famous of which was The Doomsman, a science fiction novel in the post-apocalyptic subgenre. The scholar Mike Davis has suggested that Sutphen \\"purloined\\" ideas and scenes for this book from an earlier post-apocalyptic novel, After London, by the English writer Richard Jeffries. In his own time, Sutphen was probably more famous as an authority on golf than for his novels. He was the first editor of Golf magazine, published by Harper Brothers. He also coined the term \\"the 19th hole\\". He gave the library at Princeton a collection of 75 books about golf. Sutphen worked for many years as a reader and editor, for the publishers Harper Brothers, working on novels by Theodore Dreiser among others. At some point he became a brother-in-law of (the second) Joseph Harper. As a leading figure at Harpers, Sutphen attended Mark Twain's 70th birthday celebrations in New York.  Other  In 1914 Sutphen was Chairman of the Publicity Committee of the New York Center of the Drama League. He was also a member of the Esperanto Society, and was listed in the New York Social Register.

The book is a comprehensive survey of the history of human cannibalism among the MƒÅori of New Zealand. It was the first published academic survey of MƒÅori cannibalism. The title of the book is drawn from the 16 January 1770 journal entry of Captain James Cook, who, in describing acts of MƒÅori cannibalism, stated \\"though stronger evidence of this horrid practice prevailing among the inhabitants of this coast will scarcely be required, we have still stronger to give.\\"John Byron, Samuel Wallis, Philip Carteret, James Cook, Joseph Banks (1785, 3d ed.). An account of the voyages undertaken by the order of His present Majesty for making discoveries in the southern hemisphere, vol. 3 (London) p. 295. Contents  Post publication  Shortly after the book appeared, it was featured in numerous news reports and on the New Zealand television programme 60 Minutes. The publication of This Horrid Practice was controversial because of the book's determination that cannibalism was widespread among New Zealand MƒÅori until the mid-19th century. MƒÅori cannibalism is a sensitive topic in New Zealand, and Moon anticipated that the book would be negatively received by some. The book prompted an anonymous but formal complaint to the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, arguing that it \\"describes the whole of Maori society as violent and dangerous. This is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits.\\" One of Moon's critics, Margaret Mutu, acknowledged that cannibalism was widespread throughout New Zealand but argued that Moon, as a PƒÅkehƒÅ (white person), \\"did not understand the history of cannibalism and it was 'very, very hard for a Pakeha to get it right on these things'\\". Moon responded by stating that Mutu had \\"condemned me and announced to the media that I did not understand the history of cannibalism, although she admitted to not having read even a single sentence of the book.\\" Moon also charged his critics with attempted censorship and name-calling. He commented: > What amazes me is that the critics who say I don‚Äôt understand the > mechanisations of this practice often have not even read the book. Nor do > they have evidence to the contrary. While they may not like its content, > they can‚Äôt deny historical fact. And trying to censor this book is denying > the past. Referring to the book, Dr Rawiri Taonui, New Zealand's first professor of Indigenous Studies, says about the author, \\"He's looked at no Maori language evidence, nothing from the MƒÅori Land Court. He sets that all aside and makes a giant-sized conclusion about pre-European Maori society that's based on the view of a few Europeans\\".

The station opened in 1859 and is located on the Milan‚ÄìBologna railway, Reggio Emilia‚ÄìCiano d'Enza railway, Reggio Emilia‚ÄìGuastalla railway and Reggio Emilia‚ÄìSassuolo railway. The train services are operated by Trenitalia and Ferrovie Emilia Romagna. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state- owned rail company. The city gained a high-speed railway station in June 2013, Reggio Emilia AV Mediopadana railway station. Location Reggio Emilia railway station is situated at Piazza Guglielmo Marconi, at the eastern edge of the city centre. History The station was opened on 21 July 1859, together with the rest of the Piacenza‚ÄìBologna section of the Milan‚ÄìBologna railway. The original passenger building was replaced in the mid-1930s with a new one, designed by the architect Angiolo Mazzoni. A few years later, the 1930s building was destroyed by bombing during World War II. It was replaced by the current structure, designed by the architect Roberto Narducci. Features =Passenger building= The passenger building consists of three sections. The central section has a colonnade of eight columns covered in marble. Between each pair of columns, there is a large window providing light to interior spaces. The two lateral wings extend symmetrically from the central section and are faced with brick. The central section has three levels (of which only the ground floor is accessible to passengers), while the lateral wings are two storeys high. A masonry roof provides weather protection to the entrances at the front of the building, while the entrances on the station yard side are protected by a platform canopy. In May 2007, work was completed on the renovation of the station. The project, financed by RFI and Centostazioni, cost 1.2 million euros. The renovation work was mainly to the passenger building. It included the removal of surplus elements built after the bombings of World War II, the installation of a new lighting system, additional facilities for commercial services, the renovation of public conveniences, and alterations required by laws regulating technological systems. =Station yard= The station yard has five tracks for passenger services. Tracks three and four form part of the main line (track 3 for trains with odd numbers, and track 4 for even numbered trains). The other tracks are loop sidings, and are used for trains terminating or overtaking other trains at Reggio Emilia. All tracks except for track 2 have a platform sheltered by a canopy. The platforms are connected by a pedestrian underpass. There are many other tracks (without a platform) that are used for storing rolling stock or for goods services. The station also has a goods yard with a goods shed that has been converted into a warehouse. The design of the goods shed is very similar to that of its counterparts at other Italian railway stations. Train services The station is served by the following service(s): *High speed services (Frecciarossa) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Florence - Rome *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Taranto *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Turin - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Milan - Parma - Bologna - Florence - Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Termi - Reggio Calabria *Intercity services Milan - Parma - Bologna - Rimini - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Milan - Parma - Bologna - Rimini - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Taranto *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Milan - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Florence - Rome - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Night train (Intercity Notte) Milan - Parma - Bolgona - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Express services (Regionale Veloce) Piacenza - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Bologna - Rimini - Ancona *Express services (Regionale Veloce) Milan - Piacenza - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Bolgona (- Rimini) *Regional services (Treno regionale) Parma - Reggio Emilia - Modena - Bologna *Local services (Treno regionale) Guastalla - Bagnolo in Piano - Reggio Emilia *Local services (Treno regionale) Reggio Emilia - Sassuolo *Local services (Treno regionale) Ciano - Reggio Emilia Passenger and train movements The station has about 4 million passenger movements each year.

Phillips Hospital was the only hospital for African Americans in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1937 until 1979, when the city still had segregated facilities. Located at 2601 N. Whittier Street in The Ville neighborhood, it was the first teaching hospital west of the Mississippi River to serve blacks. It continued to operate after desegregation of city hospitals, and continued to serve the black community of St. Louis until its closure in 1979. By 1961, Homer G. Phillips Hospital had trained the \\"largest number of black doctors and nurses in the world.\\" It closed as a full-service hospital in 1979. While vacant, it was listed as a St. Louis Landmark in 1980 and on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. After being adapted for residential use, it reopened as senior living apartments in 2003. History =Construction= Between 1910 and 1920, the black population of St. Louis increased by sixty percent, as rural migrants came North in the Great Migration to take industrial jobs, yet the public City Hospital served only whites, and had no facilities for black patients or staff. A group of black community leaders persuaded the city in 1919 to purchase a 177-bed hospital (formerly owned by Barnes Medical College) at Garrison and Lawson avenues on the north side of the city to serve African Americans. This hospital, denoted City Hospital #2, was inadequate to the needs of the more than 70,000 black St. Louisans. Local black attorney Homer G. Phillips led a campaign for a civic improvements bond issue that would provide for the construction of a larger hospital for blacks. When the bond issue was passed in 1923, the city refused to allocate funding for the hospital, instead advocating a segregated addition to the original City Hospital, located in the Peabody-Darst-Webbe neighborhood and distant from the center of black population. Phillips again led the efforts to implement the original plan for a new hospital, successfully debating the St. Louis Board of Aldermen for allocation of funds to this purpose. Site acquisition resulted in the purchase of 6.3 acres in the Ville, the center of the black community of St. Louis. But, before construction could begin, Homer G. Phillips was shot and killed. Although two men were arrested and charged with the crime, they were acquitted; and Phillips' murder remains unsolved. Construction on the site began in October 1932, with the city initially using funds from the 1923 bond issue and later from the newly formed Public Works Administration. City architect Albert Osburg was the primary designer of the building, which was completed in phases. The central building was finished between 1933 and 1935, while the two wings were finished between 1936 and 1937. The hospital was dedicated on February 22, 1937, with a parade and speeches by Missouri Governor Lloyd C. Stark, St. Louis Mayor Bernard Francis Dickmann, and Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. Speaking to the black community of St. Louis, Ickes noted that the hospital would help the community \\"achieve your rightful place in our economic system.\\" It was renamed in 1942 from City Hospital #2 to Homer G. Phillips, in his honor. =Operation= Although by 1944 the hospital ranked among the ten largest general hospitals in the United States, it was consistently underfunded and understaffed by the city. By 1948, its medical residents included more than one third of all graduates, including Dr. Helen Elizabeth Nash, from the two American black medical schools. In the 1940s and 1950s it was a leader in developing the practice of intravenous feeding and treatments for gunshot wounds, ulcers, and burns. Not only did it house a nursing school, but also schools for training x-ray technicians, laboratory technicians and medical record-keeping. It also began offering training and work to foreign doctors who were being denied by other hospitals because of their race. After a 1955 order by Mayor Raymond Tucker to desegregate city hospitals, Homer G. Phillips began admitting patients regardless of race, color or religious beliefs. However, it remained a primarily black institution into the 1960s, by tradition and because of the ethnic character of its neighborhood. In 1960, each department of the hospital was staffed by at least one black doctor who also was a staff member of either Washington University in St. Louis or Saint Louis University, and in 1962, three-fourths of the interns at the hospital were black. William Lacy Clay, Sr., leader of opposition to the closure of Homer G. Phillips Hospital =Closure= As early as 1961, proposals were made to merge Homer G. Phillips with City Hospital. Although some leaders in the black community opposed the idea (such as William Lacy Clay, Sr., then a city alderman and later U.S. representative for Missouri's 1st district), others accepted the notion. Local NAACP official Ernest Calloway said, \\"Giving up the hospital may be the price we have to pay for an integrated community.\\" By the mid-1960s, efforts were underway to reduce services at the hospital or close it entirely. In the late 1960s, St. Louis city moved the neurological and psychiatric departments of Homer G. Phillips to City Hospital, citing the low pay at Homer G. Phillips and distance from Washington University staff who were affiliated with City Hospital as reasons for the move. From 1964 until 1979, no other departments were moved. However, on August 17, 1979, St. Louis abruptly closed all departments at Homer G. Phillips Hospital except for a small outpatient care clinic housed in an adjacent building. The community responded with protests, and more than a hundred police officers were required to control the crowd and to escort remaining patients out. William Lacy Clay, Sr. led opposition to the closure, and many in the community charged that the closure was racially motivated. Picketing and protests outside the hospital continued for more than a year after the closure, and a community group called Campaign for Human Dignity was formed to continue the movement. Mayor James F. Conway commissioned a task force to study the issue of the hospital, but nothing resulted of the plan. The protests were ultimately unsuccessful in reopening the hospital. In the midst of the protests, the hospital was listed by the St. Louis Board of Aldermen as a St. Louis Landmark in February 1980. In 1981, after a contentious primary with incumbent Mayor Conway, Alderman Vincent Schoemehl was elected mayor of St. Louis on a campaign promising to reopen Homer G. Phillips. Instead, Schoemehl deferred to the Conway task force. The next year, the hospital was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its significance in architecture, education and to black history. But in June 1985, Schoemehl ordered the closure of all municipal hospital services, both at City Hospital and at the clinic at Homer G. Phillips. St. Louis area public hospital services were consolidated in nearby Clayton, Missouri, and the Homer G. Phillips complex was totally vacated. =Renovation= In 1988, developer William Thomas began negotiations to convert the former Homer G. Phillips Hospital into a nursing home, but these efforts failed when agreements to lease the property stalled. The property was abandoned until 1991, when the city reopened the adjacent clinic. The former nurses' building behind the main hospital also was reopened as an addition to Annie Malone Children's Home. However, the main building remained vacant. In 1998, the daughter of William Thomas, Sharon Thomas Robnett, renewed negotiations with the city to convert the building into a low-income nursing home and apartments for the elderly. She signed a 99-year lease on the property. In December 2001, renovations began on the main building through Robnett's development company, W.A.T. Dignity Corp., and Dominium Management Services, continuing through July 2003. The renovation project, led by architects of the Fleming Corporation, cost more than $42 million and produced a 220-unit supervised facility for the elderly, named Homer G. Phillips Dignity House. In response to focus groups, the developers upgraded security measures at the site, including adding a perimeter fence, surveillance cameras, and remote keyless entry. Homer G Phillips is a fully independent senior living facility for individuals age 55 plus. The Facility offers amenities which include a mini-mart grocery store, beauty and barber salon, computer lab, fully equipped exercise facility, and much more. Architecture The original Homer G. Phillips complex includes a main central building, four wards connected to the central building (forming an X shape), a service and power plant building, and a nurses' residence behind the main building. The original facade of the central building was modified with a canopy entrance extension of the emergency room facilities, obscuring the first three stories of the building. All buildings in the complex are yellow brick with terra cotta trim. Although many hospitals were constructed in the 1920s as skyscrapers, Homer G. Phillips was designed with seven stories to fit within the scale of the Ville neighborhood. A variety of roof shapes and polygonal ends on the patient wards add to the design of the building. The detailing on the building's exterior consists of a red granite base and terra cotta trim around windows and as a horizontal course around the buildings. Original secondary buildings, such as the nurses' building and lecture halls (connected to the main building via tunnel), are included as the part of hospital's designation on the National Register of Historic Places. However, a detached clinic built in 1960 is not included. Controversy In 2015, the Associated Press reported that 18 women who gave birth at Homer G. Phillips and were told their babies had died during birth believe their children might be alive. Albert Watkins, an attorney at law representing the women, says that the births occurred from the mid-1950s to the mid‚Äî1960s, that all of the mothers were black and poor, mostly from ages 15 to 20, and that in every case a nurse told the mother that her child had died but that she could not view the child's body. Because they had been prevented from seeing their reportedly dead children, these women suspect that there may have been a baby selling ring at the hospital.Was former St. Louis hospital site for baby-selling ring?, CBS News These claims were dismissed by U.S. Attorney Richard Callahan when medical records revealed that one of the parents had given birth at a different hospital and had abandoned her baby.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 20, 2011. In the episode, Leslie gets Ann to go on a date with state auditor Chris to persuade him to increase the parks department budget. Meanwhile, Andy continues harboring feelings for April, while a youth basketball game is ruined by Tom's jealousy over Ron dating his ex-wife Wendy. The episode was written by Alan Yang and directed by Dean Holland. It was the first to feature Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir and Retta as regular cast members rather than guest performers. Frequent guest stars Jama Williamson and Natalie Morales also reprised their roles. \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" marked the first original Parks and Recreation episode in eight months. It was filmed immediately after the second season concluded due to Amy Poehler's pregnancy, but NBC ended up placing the show on hold to accommodate their new series, Outsourced. The season premiere was the first Parks and Recreation episode to air in its new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was seen by 6.19 million households. It was the series' highest rating in the ages 18 to 49 demographic, and marked the highest overall viewership since the series premiere. The episode received highly positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the scene featuring \\"Swanson Pyramid of Greatness\\", Ron Swanson's guide to successful living. Plot After three months of closure due to the Pawnee budget crisis and government shutdown, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly informs her fellow employees that the parks department has been reopened, although on a shoestring budget. State auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) announce they may only conduct existing park maintenance, but Leslie wants to offer better programs and services. Meanwhile, the always-optimistic Chris continues trying to convince Ann (Rashida Jones) to go on a date with him. Ann finds him too intense, but Leslie convinces her to accept a date and try to persuade Chris to increase the parks budget. Due to popular demand from citizens, Ben restarts the youth basketball league, although with only two teams. They are coached by Ron (Nick Offerman), who is extremely strict and disciplined with his players, and Andy (Chris Pratt), who is very laid back and lets his kids go out of control. Tom (Aziz Ansari), who referees the game, becomes jealous when his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives to support Ron. Tom insists he is happy with his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) and does not mind that Wendy is dating Ron. However, Tom repeatedly calls false fouls against Ron's players until all of them are benched. When Ron and Wendy get angry, Tom ejects them from the games and declares it a forfeit, which concerns Lucy. Ann finds she enjoys her date with Chris. When she asks why he is always so positive, he explains he was expected to die as a baby due to a blood disorder, so he now feels fortunate to be alive every day. Leslie crashes the date to help Ann persuade Chris to increase the parks budget, but to her surprise, Ben also arrives, having predicted Leslie's plan. The four end up taking their date to a gay bar called The Bulge, where Chris tells Leslie he will consider increasing the parks budget. Leslie excitedly declares \\"mission accomplished\\", accidentally giving away her scheme and prompting Chris to leave, hurt that Ann had an ulterior motive for the date. Later, however, Ann apologizes to Chris and asks for another date, to which he happily agrees. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) shows up to work after having disappeared three months earlier. Andy still has a crush on April, who previously liked Andy until she learned Ann had kissed him. Andy had been leaving messages to April ever since, but she did not return them because she was in Venezuela, where she met her new boyfriend, the handsome Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). A discouraged Andy seeks advice from Leslie, who encourages him not to give up and to \\"go big or go home\\". Inspired by her own advice, Leslie proposes restoring the parks department with a Harvest Festival, which was once a Pawnee tradition until eliminated by budget cuts. Leslie and the other parks employees agree that if it is not a success, the parks department will shut down. Impressed by their enthusiasm, Chris and Ben agree to the idea. Production \\"Go Big or Go Home\\", the third season premiere, was written by Alan Yang and directed by Dean Holland. It was the first to feature Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir and Retta as regular cast members rather than guest stars. Frequent guest performers Jama Williamson and Natalie Morales also reprised their roles. The episode was originally expected to debut in September 2010 and, due to Amy Poehler's pregnancy, the Parks and Recreation producers decided to write and film the first six episodes of the season early so it could meet that air date. However, to accommodate their new comedy series Outsourced, NBC opted not to put Parks and Recreation on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the third season premiere to a mid-season date of January 20, 2011. Due to the delay, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" is set in the fall, when it was supposed to air, rather than the winter when it was actually broadcast. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" was the first original episode since \\"Freddy Spaghetti\\" in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt the momentum of the series: \\"Of course, any time you're not on the air, you run the risk of people forgetting about you; that's the sad thing about the mid-season show.\\" The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, \\"It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice.\\" Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have \\"taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy\\". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, \\"'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor.\\" In anticipation of new viewers due to the Office lead-in, \\"Go Big and Go Home\\" included an introductory sequence describing the previous events of the series. \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" introduced the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which continued to be a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: \\"I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark,\\" a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, \\"I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so when she talks about how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy.\\" Cultural references Ron Swanson's coaching style and temper is similar to that of basketball coach Bobby Knight (pictured), for whom Ron has professed respect in past episodes. While coaching basketball, Ron Swanson shows his players what he calls the \\"Swanson Pyramid of Greatness\\", a guide to living similar to the \\"Pyramid of Success\\" used by John Wooden. The pyramid includes several different categories, with honor at the top, and others below it such as America, buffets, wood working, welfare avoidance and deer protein. A poster of this pyramid was included in promotional materials given to media in advance of the episode's broadcast, and images of it were later placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. During the basketball game, Ron wears a red sweater and, at one point, angrily throws a chair into the court. These are references to the basketball coach Bobby Knight, for whom Ron had professed great admiration in the pilot episode. During scenes at the gay bar, a stylized stencil poster of Leslie hangs on the wall. It is designed in a similar way to the Barack Obama \\"Hope\\" poster designed by artist Shepard Fairey, with the word \\"Knope\\" instead of \\"Hope\\". This poster was previously featured in the second season premiere \\"Pawnee Zoo\\", where Leslie is praised as a gay rights hero for marrying two male penguins at a ceremonial wedding at the zoo. During the parks department shutdown, Tom gets a part-time job at Lady Foot Locker, a retail sportswear and footwear store. He wears the store uniform, which resembles a referee shirt, when he actually referees the youth basketball game later in the episode. Tom's part-time job is a reference to the second season episode \\"Woman of the Year\\", where it is revealed Tom's friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein also worked at a Lady Foot Locker. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" was seen by an estimated 6.19 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 3.2 rating/8 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It marked the series' highest rating in that demographic, and the highest overall viewership since the series premiere episode from April 2009, which was seen by 6.77 million household viewers. \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" lost about a quarter of the viewership of the episode of The Office (\\"Ultimatum\\"), which was seen by 8.3 million households, but New York magazine described this as a \\"respectable drop-off\\" given the popularity of that series. Parks and Recreation received a higher rating in its time-slot than the CBS crime drama series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which had more viewers at 14.34 million households, but a lower 3.1 rating/8 share. Both shows were defeated by the Fox comedy-drama series Bones, which received a 6.5 rating/10 share and was seen by 10.55 million households. =Reviews= \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" received critical acclaim, with several critics particularly complimenting the \\"Swanson Pyramid of Greatness\\" joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode was effective in appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere was a good place for newcomers to the series to start watching. She said all the characters were funny and the two new cast members had been seamlessly integrated into the show. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an \\"excellent start\\" to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal. Poniewozki said it also \\"reminds us that the show is about something: the idea, maybe quaint-seeming in this political climate, that civil servants can actually see themselves as servants and work in their community's interest\\". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" was an improvement on an already strong second season, claiming \\"the comedy seemed snappier, the relationships better grounded and the ensemble cast at their best.\\" CNN writer Henry Hanks praised the season premiere and said he was \\"overjoyed\\" that the show had returned. He found particularly funny the scenes at the start of the episode which showed the part-time jobs Tom, Donna and Jerry had during the parks department hiatus. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" not only included many fun moments, but that the jokes felt \\"fresher and more rambunctious\\" than they had in the previous season, and that the shows seemed to have discovered \\"a newfound sense of purpose\\". Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said \\"Go Big and Go Home\\", along with the five other first episodes of the season \\"couldn't be funnier\\". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman felt the episode was a strong start to the season, and particularly praised Rob Lowe, whose character he said was \\"really beginning to jell\\". Blogcritics writer Jerome Wetzel wrote, \\"I can't express in words how good it is to have Parks and Recreation back on television.\\" Wetzel said the characters were so well defined that the show rivaled the ensemble cast of The Office, a comedy made by the same producers as Parks and Recreation. Zap2it writer Rick Porter wrote that Parks and Recreation \\"was one of the two or three funniest comedies on TV when it finished its second season, and it begins its third season having lost none of its mojo\\". He particularly praised the performances of Nick Offerman and Rob Lowe. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was a pleasant way to return to the series, and was glad the harvest festival would give the characters something specific to focus on. However, Fowler felt there was a lack of closure over Tom's resentment in the episode of Ron dating Wendy. Joel Keller of TV Squad felt the new Chris and Ben characters served as a strong springboard into the third season, and that the premiere episode lived up to the anticipation caused by the show's long hiatus. However, Keller said Tom's continued pining for Wendy felt \\"a little protracted at this point\\". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the episode and said the parks department employees taking drastic steps to save their department reflected Parks efforts to seek out higher ratings. Kandell, however, felt introducing Chris' tragic back story in the episode felt rushed. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic called the episode consistently funny, and said the new characters Ben and Chris were starting to hit their stride. However, Hochberger said Eduardo subplot felt like a contrived device to continue keeping April and Andy apart. Not all reviews were entirely positive. David Hinckley of New York Daily News called Parks and Recreation \\"a good show that could be a better show\\", claiming it falls short of other NBC comedies like 30 Rock. Hinckley cited the basketball game with Andy, Ron and Tom as a scene that feels too much like a sketch comedy bit rather than a natural progression of the script. Nick Purdy of Paste said the addition of new cast members Chris and Ben may have diluted the rest of the cast's talents, and that the episode felt as if it had \\"too many plates spinning\\", leaving not enough screentime for strong characters like April Ludgate and Ron Swanson.

History  The first record of a Bah√° º√≠ living in China is of a Persian, H√°j√≠ M√≠rz√° Muhammad-'Al√≠, who lived in Shanghai from 1862 to 1868. He moved to Hong Kong in 1870, was joined by his brother and they established a trading company there. They stayed until 1897. In the period of 1881-1882 a nephew of the wife of the B√°b resided in Hong Kong.

( http://bahai-library.com/ ) --\\"China in the Bah√° º√≠ Writings\\". Web Published: 2001 Other Bah√° º√≠s established residence in Shanghai in the early 1900s, one staying until his death in 1924. The Bah√° º√≠ Writings acknowledge that Bah√° º√≠ \\"pioneers\\" reached China early.Shoghi Effendi, World Order of Baha ºu'll√°h, p.84 Numerous foreign Bah√° º√≠s traveled to China during the non-war years. Some stayed for short periods to meet with residents and others or to give presentations to those interested. Others made long term visits, visiting many cities, giving press interviews, and meeting with notable Chinese personages. Chief among this latter group was Martha Root who made three trips to China (1923-1924, 1930, 1937) - the first trip lasting for almost a year. She traveled extensively in China, lectured at many universities, had dozens of press interviews (e.g. The North China Standard, Tuesday, September 25, 1923; The Peking Daily News, October 4, 1923), buoyed the spirits of Chinese Bah√° º√≠s, and had meetings with persons notable in the history of China (e.g. Sun Yat-sen the first President of the Republic of China 1912-14; Dr. Cao Yun Xiang (also transliterated as Dr. Y.S. Tsao or Cao Qinwu) who was President of Tsinghua University from 1922 to 1928 and who became a Bah√° º√≠ in 1924. Another source of the spread of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to China was the travel of Chinese citizens abroad for study or work. From 1920 to 1940, China sent many scholars overseas. Some of them became Bah√° º√≠s. Chen Hai An (also transliterated as T.J. Chwang or Harold A. Chen), who is regarded as the first Chinese to accept the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, attended Bah√° º√≠ meetings in Chicago and returned to Shanghai in 1916. Another early adherent, Mr. Liao Chongzhen (also transliterated as Chan Sung Liu), heard of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith while studying at Cornell University about 1921. He returned to Guangzhou (Canton) to become a professor at Sun Yat-sen University and a Head of the department of sericulture in the Chinese government. His article, \\"A Chinese view of the Bah√° º√≠ Cause\\", appeared in the Bah√° º√≠ World 1932-1934.Reproduced and filed at: http://bahai- academic.hk/file.php?file=csliu_bahai_world_1932-34 Dr. Cao Yun Xiang translated many Bah√° º√≠ books including Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era published in 1931, Paris Talks and major parts of Some Answered Questions. Dr. Cao wrote in 1930: :\\"To a real Bah√° º√≠ believer, the sight of human sufferings, ignorance and poverty will redouble his efforts to work for their improvement. Vainglory, pride and selfish gains will naturally be banished from one's thoughts. China decidedly needs such men and everybody knows it and feels it keenly. If the Bah√° º√≠ Cause can supply such men, China will accept this Cause willingly and eagerly.\\" Cao Yunxiang, \\"The Bah√° º√≠ Cause in China\\", Bah√° º√≠ World 1930-1932 (under the name Dr. Tsao) Reproduced and filed at http://bahai-academic.hk/file.php?file=ystsao_china_tribute_bahaullah  Growth, expansion and maturity  The Baha'i community began to be more firmly established in Shanghai with the arrival of several pioneers. In 1921, the first publication in Chinese, was printed by the Bah√° º√≠s in Shanghai. In 1928 the first Local Spiritual Assembly in China was formed there. Other smaller communities had emerged by that time in Beijing, Guangzhou and Harbin. During World War II, despite the difficulties in communication, some correspondence between Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and the mainland Chinese Bah√° º√≠s continued. After the Second World War, all but one of the foreign Bah√° º√≠s, Husayn Usquli, had to leave China but growth still occurred among native Chinese and in surrounding communities. Starting in the 1950s new virgin territories were opened to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith: Macao in 1953 and Hainan Island in 1959. In 1957 the first National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia was elected with an area of jurisdiction embracing Japan, Korea, Taiwan (Formosa), Macao, Hong Kong, Hainan Island and Sakhalin Island. In 1967 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Taiwan was established. In 1974 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Hong Kong was established. In 1989 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Macao was established. As China expanded her efforts of reform and increased its interactions with the worldwide community more Bah√° º√≠s moved to China.  Administration and membership  There is no formal Bah√° º√≠ administrative system established in mainland China, though there is such a system formally established in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao (where the Bah√° º√≠ community is one of the five major religious communities in that Special Administrative Region).Macao Yearbook 2009. Government Information Bureau of the Macao Special Administrative Region, December 2009 http://yearbook.gcs.gov.mo/ The formal administrative structure used by the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in many parts of the world is strongly linked to the teachings given by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Within a country, this structure consists of Local Spiritual Assemblies (at the community level) and a National Spiritual Assembly with subsidiary Committees, Boards or Councils. Both Spiritual Assemblies are elected annually and made up of nine persons resident in that community or that country, respectively. Only formally registered Bah√° º√≠s may contribute to the Bah√° º√≠ Funds. No external funds are accepted for activities that are strictly religious in character or for other endeavors that relate to the internal development of the Bah√° º√≠ community. As a result of the lack of formal registration and structure, it is difficult to ascertain with some degree of certainty, the number of Bah√° º√≠s in China. The number of active followers of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Teachings in China has spread beyond the scope of knowledge of the existing administrative structures. Certainly there are active followers of the teachings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h in all of the major cities of China and in many regional centers and rural areas. China also has a substantial community of interest that see in the Bah√° º√≠ Writings guidance on how to live better lives, build a stronger family, be better parents, help their neighborhoods, communities and country by practicing all or part of the Bah√° º√≠ Teachings. In recent years the foreign Bah√° º√≠s living in China, in consultation with the relevant local authorities, have formed Foreign Bah√° º√≠ Associations. Currently there are Foreign Bah√° º√≠ Associations in five cities (Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shenzhen). They gather, with the knowledge of local authorities, in certain designated public places for spiritual gatherings, the observance of Bah√° º√≠ Holy Days and activities related to the spiritual education of their children and junior youth. These groups also aim to demonstrate the sincerity and the desire of foreign Bah√° º√≠s to contribute to the advancement of China and its peoples. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 6000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.  Cooperation with government and academia  To be loyal to the government and serve society is a firm foundation of Bah√° º√≠ belief, Government, scholars and non-governmental agencies in China, independently or in cooperation with the Spiritual Assemblies of the Bah√° º√≠s of Macao and Hong Kong and other Bah√° º√≠ organizations, have investigated Bah√° º√≠ principles, ideas and approaches as a means for advancing knowledge through discourse and for making social and economic development more effective. In recent years this has resulted in a significant number of cooperative activities. For example, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Shandong University, and Peking University have each established, on their own initiative, a Center of Bah√° º√≠ Studies. In the fall of 1995, some 500 Baha'is from more than 50 countries journeyed to China to contribute to two gatherings called by the United Nations: the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing 4‚Äì15 September 1995 and the Nongovernmental Organization (NGO) Forum on Women held in Huairou, 30 August to 8 September 1995. The NGO Forum had approximately 30,000 women and men attending. Baha'is sponsored, coordinated, or organized more than 30 workshops at the Forum. The Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing had some 17,000 people registered. Seven Bah√° º√≠ delegations were accredited to the main conference and, in addition, two organizations founded by Baha'is sent delegations.The Bah√° º√≠ World 1995-96: An International Record, pages 145 to 158. The volume was published by the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre in Haifa. Good working relationships have been developed with China's State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA). In 1993, SARA invited a delegation of the Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Macao to visit various government agencies in Beijing. This was the first time a Bah√° º√≠ institution carried out a formal exchange with the Chinese government in recent history. Subsequent delegations have visited Beijing, Shanghai, and the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu. Directors General of SARA have led delegations to visit the Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Macao and later to Israel including a visit to the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre.

Cooks was born in the Dominican Republic on June 23, 1913 to James Henry Cooks and Alice Cooks, who were originally from the neighboring island of St. Martin. His education took place mostly in Santo Domingo until moving to New York in 1929 where he went on to higher learning. Cooks was known for his love of sports and his expertise in boxing. His intellect was recognized from an early age and he attended the leadership school in the Voodoo Sacr√© Society. Cooks' involvement in the UNIA comes as no surprise as both his uncle and father were among the many St. Martiners who were members of the Marcus Garvey-led organization. He was a key link in the history of Black American nationalism between Marcus Garvey before him and Malcolm X, whom he influenced. Carlos Cooks administered the Advance Division of the UNIA after Marcus Garvey was deported. He founded the African Nationalist Pioneer Movement. He died in Harlem, New York, on May 5, 1966. He died at age 53.  Cooks and Garvey  Cooks philosophical idol, who played the most important role in his political life and career, was Marcus Garvey. His exposure to Garvey began as early as childhood days when he was taken to meetings of the Garvey Movements by his father and uncle. He then went on join the Garvey Union and its Universal African Legion. It is also said that at age nineteen, Cooks was knighted by Garvey, becoming a member of the movement. Cooks admired Garvey beyond compare. He regarded him as self-less and argued that all the thoughts and actions throughout his life were devoted towards the upliftment and improvement of the status of Black People in the United States of America. Unlike Garvey, Cooks was very skeptical of W. E. B. duBois, who he regarded as a white hireling of the NAACP. In his work, entitled Marcus Garvey Champion of African Redemption, Cooks describes duBois as an opposition to Garveyism who attacked and ridiculed the movement through his magazine Crisis. Many have accredited Cooks' development of the African Nationalist Pioneer Movement (ANPM) as significantly inspired by Marcus Garvey and his teachings of Pan-Africanism and Black Liberation.  The African Nationalist Pioneer Movement  Born out of Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the African Nationalist Pioneer Movement (ANPM) was started by Carlos Cooks on June 23, 1941. He envisioned the ANPM as \\"an educational, inspirational, instructive, constructive and expansive society... composed of people desirous of bringing about a progressive, dignified, cultural, fraternal and racial confraternity among the African peoples of the world.\\"  Lectures and Works  Some of his most famous works include: # Why Black nationalism # Fundamentalism: A Call to Action # The Nationalist Manifesto # Racial Integration‚ÄîA Sociological Farce # The Tragic Consequences of White Psychology # American Tradition Vetoes Integration # Strange, Isn't It? # Harlem‚ÄîCitadel of the Caste # Marcus Garvey Champion of African Redemption # Lumumba foils Colonialist Plot to Partition the Congo # Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana # Jomo Kenyatta, Man of Africa Cooks also gave public lectures of Africanism between 1945 and 1966. Some of his most famous ones include: # Passing the Baton Garvey to Cooks (June to December 1954) # Hair Conking; Buy Black (May‚ÄìDecember 1955) # Gamal Abdel Nasser; Marcus Garvey Day (May‚ÄìDecember 1955) # Ras and the Caste (January‚ÄìDecember 1956) # Ethiopia; Haiti; Liberia; Kenya; the Black Woman (January‚ÄìDecember 1966) # Native Africans; Civil Rights (April 3, 1966) # Religion (April 8, 1966) # Lucifer, God and Civil Rights (April 10, 1966) # The Caste Woman (April 15, 1966) # Organization ( April 15, 1966) # Yankee-Doodleism vs. Nationalism # Jews, Crackers and the Caste ( April 24, 1966)  References  * Carlos A.

The Local Government Act of Bhutan has been slightly amended in 2014.The Local Government (Amendement) Act of Bhutan 2014 http://www.nab.gov.bt/assets/uploads/docs/acts/2015/local_Government_Act.pdf Provisions of the Act The Local Government Act of 2009 establishes local governments in each of the twenty Dzongkhags, each overseen ultimately by the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 206‚Äì208, 263, 294 The Act tasks all local governments with a variety of objectives, including promoting Gross National Happiness; providing democratic and accountable government; preserving culture and tradition; promoting development; protecting public health; and discharging any other duties specifically created by other law.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß 48 Local governments are generally headed by a chairperson and a deputy chairperson who lead, represent, and manage their respective bureaucracies, each answering to the body above it and to parliament of Bhutan.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 66‚Äì85 All local governments are administrative divisions and are prohibited to make laws, however they are empowered to make rules and regulations consistent with law as established by parliament.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 3‚Äì6 Members of all local governments must be between ages 25 and 65, and sit for five-year terms, or until the local government is dissolved.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 20‚Äì21 =Dzongkhag governments= The Act establishes Dzongkhag Tshogdu (District Council) as the highest decision making body in the Dzongkhag. The Dzongkhag Tshogdu is composed of the Gup and Mangmi (elected leaders) from each Gewog, one representative from that Dzongkhag Thromde, and one representative from the Dzongkhag Yenlag Thromdes.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 7‚Äì8 Dzongkhag Tshogdus are tasked with balancing socio-economic development; promoting business; protecting consumers; coordinating government agency activities; reviewing Gewog regulations and ordinances; and representing the Dzongkhags in national referenda. The Dzongkhag Tshogdus are empowered to enforce rules on health and public safety; to regulate environmental pollution, advertising in regard to environmental aesthetics; to regulate broadcast media in accordance with the Information, Communications, and Media Act; and to regulate gambling. Dzongkhag Tshogdus also bear the responsibility for their own finances.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 49‚Äì52, 216‚Äì229 The Dzongkhag Tshogdus also oversee Dzongdags (governors), royal appointees who are the executive of each Dzongkhag. Dzongdags, in turn, are responsible for maintaining law and order, and for enforcing the driglam namzha laws.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 250‚Äì264 =Gewog governments= The analogous body at the Gewog level is the Gewog Tshogde, composed of the Gup and Mangmi, plus five to eight more elected Tshogpas (councilmen).Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 9‚Äì10 Gewog Tshogdes are, like Dzongkhag Tshogdus, responsible for enforcing rules on public health and safety and tasked with encouraging economic development. Gewog Tshogdes further regulate drinking and irrigation waters, mines, recreational areas, construction, land use, and agricultural activities in relation to the Forest and Nature Conservation Act. Gewog governments formulate five-year development plans, run their own budgets, and raise their own labor for public projects. These budgetary and developmental functions are subject to the approval and review of the Ministry of Finance. Gewog Tshogdes are empowered to levy taxes on land, buildings, cattle, grazing, entertainment, advertisement (other than in newspapers, print, radio, and internet), and anything else designated by parliament.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 53‚Äì60, 216‚Äì229 =Municipal governments= The Act of 2009 presents no substantive change from previous law regarding the Dzongkhag Tshogdu, Gewog Tshogde, terms of local offices, and qualifications for office. Subordinate municipal divisions, however, are completely re- written. Under the Act of 2009, a senior decision making body is established for some Thromdes (municipalities), the lowest level of administration. This body, called the Thromde Tshogde, is composed of seven to ten elected members and headed by a Thrompon. Every Thromde is classified as one of two types: Dzongkhag Yenlag Thromde and Dzongkhag Thromde; the latter is further subdivided into Class B Thromde and Class A Thromde based on population, development, and economy. Class A, or highest developed, Thromdes are allowed their own elected Thromde Tshogde; Class B Thromdes and Yenlag Thromdes are governed directly by either the Dzongkhag or the Gewog administration. From time to time, Parliament decides the boundaries of Thromde in consultation with the National Land Commission Secretariat and local authorities.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 11‚Äì18, 85 Thromde Tshogdes are empowered to regulate advertising, enforce public health and safety rules, and to levy taxes on land, property, property transfer (sales tax) and, \\"betterment.\\" The municipal governments are also authorized to levy special taxes on vacant and underdeveloped land to encourage development, and to raise and spend money in to promote local economic development.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 61‚Äì65 =Other provisions= The Act of 2009 also codifies procedures for the dissolution of local governments, referenced but unspecified in previous legislation. Votes of confidence may be initiated by local populations when a written appeal convinces the Election Commission of Bhutan that more than half the population desires a poll. When the Commission approves a confidence poll, it is conducted within a month's time in the form of a yes-no question. At least two-thirds of any local population must vote \\"no\\" in order to dissolve the local government. Local governments, once dissolved, must be reconstituted within ninety days.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 36‚Äì47 The Act of 2009 further provides a substantive and procedural framework for the roles and responsibilities of local government members, including conducting sessions and other business, voting, and record of proceedings and resolutions.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 86‚Äì140 It also mandates transparency and accountability through open sessions, public disclosure of information, and public participation.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 141‚Äì150 The Act of 2009 reforms offices within local bureaucracies, establishing secretariats at each level, creating a Thromde Executive Secretary, and allotting each bureaucracy with a staff of civil servants.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß¬ß 230‚Äì249, 265‚Äì277 In the Act of 2009, there is no reference whatever to Dungkhags and Chiwogs, sub-dzongkhags and sub-gewogs respectively, recognized up through the previous Act of 2007. Because the Act of 2009 repeals all previous legislation on local governments whether or not it conflicts, the legal status of Chiwogs is reduced to electoral districts, and Dungkhags are retained as judicial districts (Dungkhag Courts) as described in the Constitution of 2008.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß 2 Historical acts and local governments The Local Government Act of 2009 was preceded by the Local Government Act of 2007, the Thromde Act of 2007,Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß 2 the Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chathrim of 2002, Gewog Yargay Tshogchung Chathrim of 2002, the Bhutan Municipal Act 1999, and other legislation. All previous acts were repealed by the enactment of the Local Government Act of 2009.Local Gov't Act 2008: ¬ß 2 Until 1956, Bhutan had nine provinces headed by the penlops: Byakar (centered in present-day Bumthang), Dukye, Haa, Paro, Punakha, Dagana, Thimphu, Trongsa, and Wangdue Phodrang. Later, the country was reorganized into dzongkhags. In August 1987, the territory of Gasa dzongkhag was divided between Punakha and Thimphu; Chhukha dzongkhag was formed by merging the parts of Samtse, Paro, and Thimphu. In 1992, Gasa dzongkhag was re-established and carved out from Punakha; the same year, Trashi Yangtse dzongkhag was carved out from Trashigang. The Acts of 2002 (Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chathrim and Gewog Yargay Tshogchung Chathrim) established much of the basic legal framework for Dzongkhg and Gewog administration. This framework established offices and terms, election and meeting procedures, functions and regulatory powers, roles and responsibilities, and codes of conduct for local governments comparable to those that were re-codified in subsequent legislation. The Local Government Act of 2007 authorized Dungkhags as intermediate divisions between Dzongkhags and Gewogs. These subdivisions were governed by Dungkhag Administration headed by a Dungpa. Under this Act, Gewogs were further subdivided into Chiwogs for Gewog administration. Aside from these legal subdivisions, the law of the Act of 2007 was largely retained, frequently verbatim, by the Act of 2009.

The film is directed by Larry Charles, who previously directed Baron Cohen's mockumentaries Borat and Br√ºno. Baron Cohen, in the role of Admiral General Aladeen, the dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya visiting the United States, stars alongside Anna Faris, Ben Kingsley, Jason Mantzoukas, and an uncredited appearance by John C. Reilly. Producers Jeff Schaffer and David Mandel said that Baron Cohen's character was inspired by real-life dictators like Kim Jong-il, Idi Amin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Saparmurat Niyazov.Stuart Jeffries, The Dictator: are we right to laugh?, Guardian (May 15, 2012). The film's opening credits dedicate it to Kim Jong-il, \\"in loving memory\\". Plot For years, the fictional North African nation of the Republic of Wadiya has been ruled by Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen, a childish, tyrannical, sexist, anti-Western, and antisemitic dictator who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors terrorism (especially giving shelter to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden after \\"they killed his double one year ago\\"), changes many words in the Wadiyan dictionary to \\"Aladeen\\", and is working on developing nuclear weapons to attack Israel. He also refuses to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father prior to his death. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address the council. Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton, supposedly in charge of the security preparations but was a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir, whom Aladeen's father passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted lookalike named Efawadh, whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening up the country's oil fields to the Chinese and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally burns himself to death in a failed torture attempt. When his burnt corpse is discovered, Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognizable as Clayton shaved off his iconic beard prior to his death. Wandering through New York City, Aladeen encounters Zoey, a human rights activist who offers him a job at her socially progressive, alternative lifestyle co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters \\"Nuclear\\" Nadal, the former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons programme, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the warhead's design. Aladeen follows him to New York's \\"Little Wadiya\\" district, which is populated by refugees from his own country, and meets him in \\"Death to Aladeen Restaurant\\", a restaurant run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had ordered to be executed. The restaurant's waiter and the refugees mistake him as \\"Aladeen sympathizer\\" after a failed attempt to cover up his identity and is about to be attacked when Nadal saves him. Nadal reveals to Aladeen that all the people he had ordered to be executed are instead sent into exile to the United States; the secret police were actually members of the resistance. Nadal agrees to help Aladeen thwart Tamir's plot and regain his power, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiya's nuclear programme again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoey's job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and teaches him how to masturbate, and eventually falls in love with her after seeing her angry. Turning around Zoey's struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a personality cult around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review. However, Aladeen's relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he decides to be honest with her and reveal his true self; she cannot love a man who was so brutal to his own people. After acquiring a new beard taken from a corpse, Aladeen ziplines into the hotel and tells Efawadh he has recovered; his double was fooled into thinking the Supreme Leader was ill. At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamir's document in front of the media and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of dictatorship, drawing unintended parallels to current issues in the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoey's strongly-held views, vows to democratize his country and open up Wadiya's oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Angry with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to assassinate him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet and survives, as it is his job \\"to be shot in the head\\". Tamir is arrested afterwards. A year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are rigged in favor of Aladeen (who has now added the titles President-Prime Minister to his previous Admiral-General).

Scenes during the credits show Aladeen's convoy, now consisting of eco-friendly cars, Aladeen visiting a re-instated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Aladeen responds to the news by asking if Zoey is having \\"a boy or an abortion\\". =Unrated version= The unrated cut of The Dictator runs an additional fifteen minutes from the original 83-minute theatrical version.

Early life He was born on 28 February 1837 in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland, to Ellen Mary Russell and her husband, James Grace, a landowner. Grace grew up on a farm belonging to his father. His maternal family were Scottish Calvinists, but he was brought up and educated a Catholic. His formal education began at the Jesuit-run Stonyhurst College, England. He apparently started his university studies in Dublin and spent some time on the Continent; this may have included a period in Paris. In 1858 he received a diploma in medicine at the University of Jena, Germany, and in 1859 he took his licentiate at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Military career He enlisted in the British Army on 20 April 1859 as staff assistant and surgeon. He arrived in Auckland with a detachment of troops on the Nugget on 21 June 1860, three months after the start of the Waitara war in the Taranaki Region. He served as a medical officer in the First Taranaki War, the Invasion of Waikato and in subsequent campaigns. He left the Imperial Army, joining the Colonial Forces, and became their Surgeon-General. Medical career In 1866 Grace started a very successful medical practice in Wellington, which he was to keep up for over 30 years. He was Honorary Surgeon at the Wellington Hospital from 1879‚Äì1882 and Honorary Consulting Surgeon at Wellington Hospital between 1883‚Äì1886. Politics In 1870 he received a letter from Sir William Fox, Premier of New Zealand, inviting him to the Legislative Council, the upper house of the New Zealand Parliament. He served on the Council until his death. In 1890 he moved the address in reply, and in a long speech looked back over his 30 years in the colony. Business Grace was a founding director of the New Zealand board of the Australian Mutual Provident Society from 17 February 1871 and was chairman from 1891 to 1893. He was president of the New Zealand Medical Association in 1892. His many business activities included ownership of the Wellington City Tramways Company for some years. He sold the company to the Wellington City Council in 1900. Author In 1899 Grace published a short book, A sketch of the New Zealand war. Family On 25 January 1866 he married Agnes Mary Johnston, the daughter of John Johnston, a wealthy merchant and a member of the Legislative Council. The couple were to have nine surviving children: five boys and four girls. His elder brother William Russell Grace was also the first Catholic Mayor of New York. His nephew Cecil Grace attempted a crossing of the English Channel in December 1910 in an aeroplane. He flew from Dover to Calais. However, in coming back he became disoriented and over Dover flew northeast over the Goodwin Sands toward the North Sea and was lost.New York Tribune 24 December 1910 References Category:1837 births Category:1903 deaths Category:New Zealand Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Members of the New Zealand Legislative Council Category:Irish emigrants to New Zealand (before 1923) Category:University of Jena alumni Category:New Zealand Roman Catholics Category:People from Clonmel Category:New Zealand Medical Association Category:People educated at Stonyhurst College Category:Burials at Karori Cemetery Category:19th-century New Zealand politicians ","title":"Morgan Stanislaus Grace"},{"id":"30553338","text":"Johnny Drum Bourbon is a Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey produced in Bardstown, Kentucky by Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, Ltd.

The company generally does not identify where in Kentucky its products are actually distilled, although it has been reported that most of their products have been distilled by the Heaven Hill Distillery, which has its company headquarters located close to the Willett Distillery Company. The two companies are located about a half mile from each other along the same road in Bardstown, Kentucky.

(Access date December 11, 2010.) The product is named after the Willett family which founded the company that produces it. The company began as the Willett Distilling Company. John David Willett (born in 1841) had been the master distiller for the Moore, Willett & Frenke Distillery, which he had formed with his brother-in-law Thomas S. Moore of Bardstown, and a Mr. Frenke of Louisville. In 1876, Willett fell ill and sold his interest in the company.Old Bardstown 4 Year Old, Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, D & M. The resulting company became the Mattingly Moore Distillery. John David Willett would, however, live on for another 38 years after this transaction. He died in 1914. Starting at the age of 15 with a five-year stint at the Mattingly Moore Distillery, his son A. Lambert Willett (born in 1883) picked up his father's profession. Lambert Willett then worked for the Max Selliger & Co. Distillery for twenty years ‚Äì eventually becoming one-third owner and superintendent of the plant. A. L. \\"Thompson\\" Willett, Lambert's son (born in 1909), also joined him at the plant as assistant superintendent. Lambert Willett later purchased a farm and, together with his sons and especially led by Thompson Willett, founded the Willett Distilling Company on the site. Thompson and Lambert Willett used John David Willett's bourbon recipes as the basis of the whiskey that they would distill there and brand as \\"Old Bardstown\\". The construction of the Willett Distilling Company began in the Spring of 1935 (just after the 1933 repeal of alcohol prohibition in the United States), and the company produced its first batch of 300 bushels (about 30 barrels) on March 17, 1936. Five years after founding the Willett Distilling Company, Lambert Willett left Max Selliger & Co. to pursue the family business full-time. Lambert Willett and at least four of his sons held substantial positions of responsibility at the company. Lambert Willett died in 1970. A. L. \\"Thompson\\" Willett, the son of Lambert Willett, was the president of the Willett Distilling Company. At one time, he was also the president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, and he also held a number of other positions of prominence in the community. Thompson Willett's daughter Martha Harriet Willett and other members of her generation of the family worked for the company as well, and in 1972 she married Even (pronounced Evan) G. Kulsveen of Hamar, Norway, who would later purchase the company. During the 1970s energy crisis, the company switched from producing whiskey to producing ethanol for gasohol fuel.June's American Whiskey Club, D & M, May 30, 2009. This strategy soon failed when fuel prices returned to lower levels, and the distilling facilities were completely shut down in the early 1980s. Kulsveen purchased the company and the property on July 1, 1984, and renamed the company to Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (KBD), Ltd. For some time, KBD continued to produce bourbon from the aging barrels that the Willett distillery had produced before they had stopped distilling. However, as time moved on, KBD increasingly began to purchase its bourbon from other distilleries and operate as an independent bottling company. Kulsveen continues to operate the facility to this day, and the next generation of the family, including their son E. A. \\"Drew\\" Kuslveen and their son's wife Janelle, their daughter K. M.-B. \\"Britt\\" Chavanne and her husband Hunter Chavanne, are also now involved in the company.American Whiskey: We Visit Bardstown's Secret Master Whiskeyman... sort of, February 22, 2001, updated April 29, 2006.

(Access date December 11, 2010.) The company introduced the Willett Pot Still Reserve bourbon brand in 2008. It was originally a single barrel bourbon. Each bottle was sealed with a label identifying the individual aging barrel, the number of the bottle within the series of bottles for that barrel, and the total number of bottles from the barrel (example: \\"Bottle No. 116 of 242 from Single Barrel 149\\"). However, at some point in time roughly around 2015, it stopped being a single barrel brand and became a small batch brand instead. The bottles as still sealed with a paper labeling strip, but they no longer carry bottle numbers (example: \\"Small Batch Bourbon made in Kentucky ‚Äì Batch No. 16A3\\"). For its definition of the term \\"small batch\\", the company said in 2011 that it used at most 12 barrels per batch for its \\"small batch\\" brands. The company also makes another brand of whiskey with a similar name ‚Äì called Willett Family Reserve. The Family Reserve brand is a limited-production barrel proof single barrel whiskey produced in bottles that resemble wine bottles in shape. (Several other brands produced by Willett, such as Rowan's Creek and Noah's Mill, also use wine-type bottle shapes.)

It is purely managed by Jane and Selvy from Peru.2 Peru's Challenge have received worldwide recognition for their work and have been featured on the Australian hit travel show Getaway2 showcasing the work that they have completed and are undertaking in the rural communities of Cuzco. This national NGO won the ‚ÄòHighly Commended‚Äô in the ‚ÄòBest Volunteer Organisation‚Äô category of the Virgin Holidays Responsible Tourism Awards in 2009.4 Amongst their global acknowledgment, local news networks5 have covered the work of previous volunteers as the work that Peru's Challenge has done and is doing in Peru has had a universal effect on anyone who participates. In addition to their work with communities, Peru's Challenge offers tours in their package in order for volunteers to experience the ancient wonders of Peru.  Goals  1\\\\. To create basic opportunities for the children of Peru: * Education * Health * Happy and safe environment Before starting any project, Peru's Challenge have lengthy discussions with all members of the community to ascertain what it is that they require for their children and how PC can work closely together to help them achieve this. It is very important that the community feels they are working as a part of the team. The community are involved in all decisions and plans. This way, they learn to continue the great work that is done together. They become self-sustaining with the support of the relationship built with the Ministry of Education. 2\\\\. To provide an exceptional travel and volunteer experience: Peru's Challenge is also very committed to providing an exceptional volunteer travel experience to all of participating volunteers. Volunteers are the lifeblood of the organisation. It is their invaluable assistance that makes the job of assisting local Peruvian communities possible. Being part of the Peru's Challenge volunteer team is about realising how easy it is to give Peruvian children more opportunities, while traveling and enjoying the absolute beauty of Peru, and making friendships with other volunteers from around the world.5  Current projects  = Introduction = Most of Reto Peru's work focuses in and around Cuzco in areas considered as some of the poorest in Peru. The population of communities assisted are essentially indigenous, of Quechua origin, uneducated and very malnourished. The department of Cuzco is located in the southeast part of Peru. It covers an area of 70,000 km2, most of which is in the Andes Mountains, at an altitude of more than above sea level. Within the Cuzco department, 75 percent of its population live in a situation of poverty and 60 percent of the inhabitants have at least one unsatisfied basic need. Departmental levels of education and literacy are worse than the national average, with Cuzco among the worst in the country at 18%. Although the region of Cuzco is one of the most popular tourist areas in all of South America (more than 1 million people visited Machu Picchu in 2006), none of the economic benefits and investment of tourism reach the local rural communities. = Project One - Quilla Huata = Date started: September, 2008 Quilla Huata, meaning ‚ÄúHouse of the Moon‚Äù in Quechua, is home to over 100 families, with an average of seven people per household. Families rely solely on agricultural produce. Each family is in charge of looking after two or three plots of land which they work by hand. Produce is then sold down in the Cuzco markets (a two-hour walk away), which brings in an average wage of approximately US$5 per week. Teenagers and young adults are leaving the community to find work in Cuzco and the nearby jungle. The majority are uneducated or underskilled and do not find work and therefore become homeless or run into problems by selling drugs or stealing. The Quilla Huata School has been abandoned by the Department of Education and therefore children who do want to go to school walk one hour to the nearby community school in Pumamarca. The children are severely malnourished and full of parasites. Houses are poorly equipped with no electricity, safe drinking water or toilets. Beds are usually a couple of blankets on the floor and cooking facilities are dismal with kitchen areas full of smoke. Despite all this, the Quilla Huata community is made up of positive, happy people. They are full of hope and ideas and are dedicated to working side-by-side with Peru‚Äôs Challenge to ensure a better future for their children. = Project Two - Pumamarca = Date started: September, 2005 Pumamarca, meaning area of the Puma; is a small agricultural community located in the mountain region above Cuzco. The community members survive on their agricultural products ‚Äì fresh flowers, maize, potatoes and other vegetables, which they sell at local markets in Cuzco. The producers have access to plots that are farmed continuously year-round for maximum produce and are also continuously cutting down trees. Both these practices are causing erosion and a decrease in the fertility value of the land. Producers rely on weekly local rural markets which, because of the region's isolation, appear as the main place for exchange and transactions. Because the community does not have any funds, the Department of Education in Peru does not support the local primary school, and it is left to fend for itself. The benefit of non-agricultural activities is that they bring about a more stable and better time-distributed income stream. Women play an essential role in developing such activities, particularly small shops, cattle raising, flower markets and in the craft industry. = Project Three - Huandar = Date started: March, 2005 Approximately 200 families live in this community and the majority cannot afford for their children to go to the State primary school in Pisaq. For the families that can, the biggest problem is that their children, mostly between the ages of seven and twelve, have to walk the five kilometres into Pisaq along a dirty and dusty road. This road is the main transport route for trucks from the Amazon jungle to Cuzco. Little kids are getting lost in the dust by one truck and then getting run over by the next. The result is devastating. Many have lost their lives or are bedridden for months with serious injuries. Another problem for the community is their water supply. Approximately 1 km up the facing mountain from the village is an ancient Incan water drain that holds fresh water. This is the only fresh water accessible for the community but it takes approximately six hours to reach (due to the altitude of 3000 m and the sheer steepness of the Andes Mountains). This exhausting trip usually provides only two buckets of water.  Completed projects  = Picol = Dates: October 2003 to October 2005. Picol was primarily an agricultural area providing employment to the community of over 100 families. In the last ten years, much of the fertile land has been taken over by property developers pushing the Picol families off the land, forcing them to leave the area and into unemployment. This unemployment results in families using their children to beg and sell sweets and postcards to tourists, therefore not allowing them to attend school. The other problem was that the Department of Education did not recognise this community as an area to support. Therefore, the school was not receiving teachers or materials. In October 2005, Reto Peru met with the parents association of the school and it was decided that the school should be handed back to the Picol community. Although it happened a lot earlier than anticipated, the people are very happy with the result. As always, the aim of any Reto Peru project is to give it back to the community when they feel they are ready to take over. Reto Peru will continue to assist the community via the Mothers Group. They will also continue our House Challenge program and the regular visits from medical specialists. How Reto Peru helped Education: Reconstructed the roof of the school. *Renovated and painted the four existing classrooms. *Built and equipped a kitchen and eating area. *Built flushing toilets and hot-water showers. *Provided a salary for another teacher to split up grade one and two. *Provided physical education and learning materials. *Organised excursions for each grade. Health and Wellbeing: *Developed a greenhouse and vegetable garden to supply the lunchtime meals for the kids. *Organised for doctors to visit the community and provided free medicines. *Organised for specialists to visit the community throughout the year i.e. optometrists, gynecologists, nutritionists and pediatricians. *Taught general hygiene to the kids and their families, by providing toothbrushes and toothpaste, hair cutting and face and hand cleaning. *Developed community action groups in regards to access to safe drinking water. *Provided facilities for safe drinking water into a number of houses. Social: *Provided afternoon classes to the mothers of the community in weaving, art & craft, painting, jewelry making, etc. *Provide education sessions on hygiene, nutrition, pregnancy. *Organised counseling sessions for victims of alcoholism and domestic violence. *Ran the House Challenge program to renovate houses in the community. *Built and equipped a workshop for the mothers group. = Yutto = Yutto is an agricultural community situation an hour's drive south of Cuzco. The community survives on selling agricultural products - maize, potatoes, etc. The school at Yutto is different from most in that it organises two weekly sessions for students. During these two weeks, an agricultural specialist stays at the school to teach the kids all about their field of expertise i.e. growing and selling maize, or breeding and looking after cuy (guinea pig). The community realises that the younger generation cannot keep moving into Cuzco to try to find work as the majority end up unemployed. They know that their livelihood is based around their agricultural success. Reto Peru volunteers assisted as teachers in English, Art and Sport. = San Martin = San Martin is a great school for kids with special mental and physical needs. Because the school has such a great reputation, placements are hard to find. Over the last six months, we have helped register two girls into the school. Volunteers regularly visit the school to keep an eye out for Roxanita and Luc Clara and to make sure they are enjoying the classes and doing their homework.

As of February 2020, it remains the greatest snowfall in one storm in Chicago history. As the blizzard was a surprise during the day with people already at work or school, it stopped the city for a few days as people dug out. \\"The storm was a full-blown blizzard, with 50 mph-plus northeast wind gusts creating drifts as high as 15 feet.\\" Chronology Weather map at midnight on January 27, 1967. On Tuesday January 24, the maximum temperature was but began to fall the next day with the passage of a marked cold front. In fact, the front brought arctic air from a strong 1032 mb high pressure center over the southern Canadian Prairies. On the other hand, an altitude barometric trough, coming from the Rockies, developed a low pressure system at the surface near the Texas Panhandle. At midnight Thursday, January 26, the low moved to Oklahoma while strengthening. During the day, the elevated trough and surface low crossed the Mississippi Valley, reaching South-central Indiana before midnight on January 27 and deepening to 997 mb. Dew points of 50 to 60¬∞F, or more, in the warm sector of the surface low brought significant humidity from the Gulf of Mexico while the high pressure moved to the Lake Superior, keeping cold and dry air over the Great Lakes. The strong pressure gradient between the latter and the low pressure center caused strong winds over Lake Michigan, causing widespread blowing snow while heavy snowfall affected the Chicago area. On January 27, the low occluded. Its central pressure reached 990 mb while passing over Lake Erie and Southern Ontario, Canada. Snow stopped in the evening in Chicago and strong winds moved north-northwest out of the region.  Forecast  The weather forecast on January 25 for the 26, was for rain or snow because the cold front was scheduled to stop in the Chicago area. On the evening broadcast, the National Weather Service started talking about snow mixed with freezing rain, but it was not until the night that the forecast was changed to mention snowfall giving an accumulation of 4 inches. A heavy snow warning was therefore issued. On the morning of January 26, the quantities were increased by 4 to 8 inches, well below what would be received. People were not aware of the extent of the storm and that the snow would stop travel within and from the area, as noted in the understated opening to the evening news on television station WMAQ-TV on January 26, 1967, where the newsman reported that the worst of the storm was over, which it was not. Depth of snow and effects on transportation People stranded with their cars in Chicago Blizzard of 1967 Snowbank of blizzard The snow fell continuously in Chicago and surrounding areas from 5:02 am on Thursday, January 26 until 10:10 am Friday when had fallen. The storm played havoc with travel home from work and school. \\"Thousands were stranded in offices, in schools, in buses. About 50,000 abandoned cars and 800 Chicago Transit Authority buses littered the streets and expressways.\\" Other sources estimate 20,000 cars and 1,100 buses stranded in the blizzard. Gusts of 48 to 53 miles per hour (measured at Midway Airport) caused large snowdrifts to accumulate. Thunderstorms occurred and several funnel clouds were sighted during the blizzard. The blizzard closed both Midway Airport and O'Hare Airport. Ten-foot drifts covered the runways at Midway. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley ordered city workers to clear city streets around the clock and asked citizens for help. On Friday, the city was virtually shut down and area schools were closed. Chicago's fleet of 500 snow plows and 2,500 workers was out in force, and additional snow removal equipment was sent from Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan. Many of the south suburbs of Chicago reported that their snow plowing equipment failed during the blizzard, and recommended people stay home on Friday, as recorded in a collection of local radio news reports from the first day of the blizzard. Although the city was on the move again by Tuesday, it took the city of Chicago three weeks to plow all the streets of snow, as it did not warm up enough for the snow to melt away. In 2017 as the 50th anniversary of the blizzard neared, people looked back on their own stories of the first day, how long it took some to get home, up to six hours for a usual half hour trip, and how some did not get home for one to two days, staying in their car, in a local tavern. One woman decided to walk home from her downtown job, and she said, \\"People were helping each other ‚Äî it was wonderful. People were stopping in cars that could get through, and they would take you a certain distance,\\" she said. \\"Back then, you could trust people to take you where you wanted to go. You never thought twice about getting in and letting them give you a ride home.\\" Some sources consider this blizzard to have been \\"paralyzing\\" to the city, and the greatest disruption in the city since the Chicago Fire of 1871. Plowing was rendered ineffective as the snow fell because the blizzard winds blew the snow back on the freshly plowed roads, stranding vehicles on expressways and arterial streets alike. The storm affected the metropolitan Chicago area, with the heaviest snow falling from the west side extending east to northwest Indiana, as far as LaPorte. Rockford, northwest of Chicago, had a few inches of snow, while far southeastern Wisconsin (Lake Geneva down to Kenosha) registered 6-10 inches of snow. After the blizzard stopped Children playing in the snow after the 1967 blizzard After the winds stopped blowing, snow removal could be effective, slowly. Helicopters were the emergency vehicles, delivering medicine to diabetics, and food to people stranded in their cars. Expectant mothers were taken to hospitals by sleds, snow plow or even a bulldozer. Women who could not get out, delivered their babies at home. The airports opened about midnight Monday after the snow stopped falling. Most schools reopened on Tuesday following the blizzard. People who were school age in the blizzard recall the beauty of the snow- covered city and the fun they had in the snow when school was closed. Deaths Twenty-six people died in the Chicago due to the blizzard, including a young girl shot in crossfire between looters and police. Some died from heart attacks due to shoveling the snow. More snowfall on February 1, 1967 The Chicago area started to recover from the extreme snowfall over the weekend, then it snowed on Wednesday, February 1. The following Sunday, February 5, another storm dumped of snow. Record snowfall for a single storm The inches of snow that fell on Chicago for 29 hours from the morning of January 26, 1967 is a record for a single storm. The that fell on January 26‚Äì27 was the greatest amount of snow for a 24-hour period, later surpassed by Groundhog Day Blizzard of 2011 with February 1‚Äì2, 2011. The single day record of for January 26 was later broken by the Chicago Blizzard of 1979 when fell. Between January 26 and February 5, of snow fell, which is typical for an entire Chicago winter. This helped contribute to the 1966-67 winter setting a record seasonal snowfall of for Chicago, breaking the previous record of , set in 1951-52. This record would be surpassed just three seasons later, when the 1969-70 winter dropped of snow on the city. Since 1970, the city has surpassed the 1966-67 snowfall total three additional times: in 1977-78, in 1978-79, and in 2013-14. In 2011, when another snowstorm was in progress, the ten worst snowstorms in Chicago to that date were noted, the list topped by the January 1967 storm. Later severe snowstorms did not stop the city totally, because of improved weather forecasting which allowed businesses to decide to close early when snow was expected, and the city to devise plans for effective snow removal for each snow storm, including barring overnight parking on main streets in winter. Sensors and cameras are in place to see where snow removal is most needed, and the fleet of snow plows is smaller to do the same work, at 330. Disposal of the snow Disposing the snow collected by plows posed challenges on account of the drifting and the quantity of snow and so many roads blocked by abandoned vehicles. Some was put on a train in refrigerated cars to Florida so children there could see what snow looked like. Other railroads disposed of snow on their own property by melting it, or if they had freight trains heading south, loaded a few cars with snow that would melt en route. The city of Chicago resorted to dumping it in the Chicago River, a practice no longer used, for bad effects on river water quality; instead it has designated locations throughout the city for dumping excess accumulations. The city also had a few vehicles that melted the snow in the truck, greatly reducing its volume. Photos of the city in the blizzard Some roofs collapsed, vehicles were stalled in snow, while some people had fun or tried out their snowshoes to get to work on Friday January 27, 1967. In 2013, the Chicago Tribune collected its photos from those days, to tell the story that way.

It would have been located near Bridge Canyon Rapids in an extremely rugged and isolated portion of the canyon, downstream of Lee's Ferry and at the uppermost end of Lake Mead. First proposed in the 1920s, the project was seriously considered by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for a period of over twenty years from the early 1950s to 1968. If built, the dam would have stood high, forming a reservoir stretching more than upstream, including along the border of Grand Canyon National Park. The dam would serve mainly for hydropower production in conjunction with several others further upstream including Marble Canyon Dam, on the Colorado, Green and other rivers. Due to its enormous potential for environmental destruction and the dwindling flows of the Colorado River, the project stalled in 1968 after years of public opposition. However, the location is considered one of the best remaining sites for a large dam in the western United States. Background Bridge Canyon Dam was first seriously considered in the mid-20th century as part of the Pacific Southwest Water Plan, which aimed to deliver water from the Colorado River to central Arizona in order to allow that state to utilize its full allotment in the Colorado River Compact. The proposed project would involve a canal running from Lake Havasu on the Colorado River to supply metro Phoenix and the surrounding irrigated lands. A pair of dams within the Grand Canyon would provide the hydroelectric power necessary to pump the water uphill along the canal's course. One of these dams would be located at the lower end of Marble Canyon and was known as Marble Canyon or Redwall Dam; the other, known as Bridge Canyon Dam or Hualapai Dam, would be situated in Bridge Canyon in Lower Granite Gorge. The two dams would generate a combined 12.2 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) annually with a total installed capacity between 2000 and 3000 megawatts (MW). In the 1940s, Reclamation began investigating potential sites for a dam in the lower Grand Canyon near the river's confluence with Diamond Creek, upstream of Lake Mead. A small tent city was erected along the Colorado River near Bridge Canyon, complete with \\"a tar- paper cook shack with tables, a walk-in refrigerator attached, and tents or sleeping accommodations for the men‚Ä¶ a small generating plant which furnished lights and fans for the swamp-type air conditioners which were a necessity in this canyon.\\" The site was only accessible by a boat trip up the Colorado River from Lake Mead, and was plagued by torrid heat, poor access, floods and long working hours. After more than four potential damsites were investigated, the best one was found at a location called the \\"Lower Gneiss\\" site below the confluence of Gneiss Canyon, a small tributary, and northwest of the small town of Peach Springs. The dam was proposed as a concrete arch-gravity structure high above its foundations, with a hydraulic head from . It would raise the water behind it for upstream to an elevation of just below the mouth of Kanab Creek. Defeat After proposals for the dam surfaced, they met with almost immediate opposition from environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, as well as an outcry from recreation-minded general public. The reason for this was because the dam would back water up for along the border of Grand Canyon National Park, and through Grand Canyon National Monument. The resistance was strengthened by previous controversies relating to the encroachment of dams and reservoirs on protected lands, most notably O'Shaughnessy Dam, built in Yosemite National Park in 1924; the Glen Canyon Dam, completed in 1966, and the earlier controversy over the U.S. of Bureau of Reclamation's proposed Echo Park Dam, which would have flooded sections of Utah's Dinosaur National Monument.Powell, p. 109 All of the proposals thus far for the dam have failed for one reason or another. In 1938, the state of Arizona attempted to gain federal permission to build the dam. Again in 1950, a bill was introduced in Congress for a Bridge Canyon Dam that would serve the water diversion purposes of the CAP. This time, it was not activists who killed it but rather representatives from California in the United States House of Representatives. This was because California did not want Arizona's utilization of its share of the Colorado River to increase, which would mean possible shortfall of water supplies in that state.Powell, p. 111 Even though the hypothetical dam and its reservoir lie along a remote, seldom seen or visited reach of the Colorado River, it would still destroy many well-known landmarks and points of interest. These include lower Havasu Creek, famed for its travertine formations and waterfalls, and Lava Falls, one of the most spectacular rapids on the Colorado.Palmer, p. 84 Opponents state that the relatively low storage capacity of the dam, as well as its potential to evaporate more than of water per year, do not justify the dam's destruction of natural features and disruption to river ecology and recreational activities. Because of the heavy silt load of the Colorado, Bridge Canyon Reservoir would eventually fill with sediment, rendering it useless. Estimates by the Sierra Club suggested a useful life span of 60‚Äì160 years, while the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation predicts 163 years.Palmer, p. 85 The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation suggested building additional dams on Kanab Creek, the Little Colorado River and Paria River to act as silt traps in order to prolong the life span up to 250 years. The completion of Glen Canyon Dam upstream in 1966 effectively reduced the flow of sediment through the Grand Canyon by 85 percent, extending the Bridge Canyon project life indefinitely. However, this alone was not enough to save the dam. As a result, the Bridge Canyon project officially stalled in 1984.Russell, p. 62 The Pacific Southwest Water Plan was eventually implemented on a limited scale and is now known as the Central Arizona Project. In order to replace the power that would have been provided by Bridge and Marble Canyon Dams, the coal-fired Navajo Generating Station was completed near Page, Arizona in 1976.

Early life and family Maria Bach was born in Vienna, Austria, on 11 March 1896. Her parents were Robert Bonaventura Michael Wenzel von Bach and Eleonore Josepha Maria Theresia Auguste Bach. In 1897, she moved with her family to the castle, Leesdorf, in Baden, Austria. Bach's father, Robert, was an attorney, painter, and violinist. Her mother, Elenore, was both a singer and composer who has performed under the conductors Gustav Mahler and Johannes Brahms. Maria had two older sisters, Theresa and Katharina, and a younger sister, named Henriette. Theresa wrote poetry that was put to Bach's music. Katharina married into a highly aristocratic family. Henriette was a solo cellist. Marie took piano lessons at the Musikschule Grimm in Baden and at the age of fourteen began violin lessons. Early music Maria Bach began private piano lessons at the age of five with a faculty member at the Grimm School of Music. She would later take lessons with Paul De Conne in 1912. At the same time, she also began violin lessons with Jaroslav Suchy of the Vienna Opera. She played second violin and viola in her father's in-house string ensemble. Bach's parents demanded that both she and Henriette perform long and consistent hours of individual practice. The two daughters would regularly have three hour music reading sessions for learning classical and romantic chamber music. In 1914, she started composing her first prelude, which she followed with songs and other piano pieces. On Sundays Maria and Henriette were allowed to perform at their family's soirees, gatherings where music was performed by the Bach family, when they became more experienced with their instruments. In 1917, Bach composed \\"Flohtanz (Flea's Dance).\\" In \\"Flohtanz\\" the lively solo piano lasts for approximately three minutes. Education Maria Bach began studying composition at the Vienna Academy of Music with Joseph Marx in 1919. Under the tutelage of Marx, Bach wrote four-part fugues, brief piano scores, and analyzed the music of Chopin, Debussy, and Stravinsky. Marx would later help Bach develop her own personal style of composing. She made her debut as a composer in 1921 with Narrenlieder f√ºr Tenor und Orchester, a song cycle which was later printed by Schott in Vienna. Vienna Academy of Music (1919-1925) Maria began studying at the Vienna Academy of Music in 1919 studying composition under the tutelage of Joseph Marx with whom she analyzed the music of Chopin, Debussy, and Stravinsky. While studying under Marx, Bach specialized in writing four-part fugues and brief piano scores. Marx would later help Bach develop her own style of composing by utilizing variations in rhythms and sonorities. Music during World War II During the war, the Nazi party established music prohibitions in Austria. Due to their preference for classical music, which was considered conservative and traditional, \\"modern\\" compositions were not allowed to be performed. However, Bach's compositions were deemed both conservative and traditional among Nazi standards and were deemed acceptable to be performed. Relationships and marriage During the 1920s Bach developed a relationship with Ivan Boutnikoff, a Russian composer and conductor. Boutnikoff later became her mentor in conducting and orchestration. On 7 October 1952 Bach married Arturo Ciacelli. The two stayed married until Ciacelli's death in 1966. Ciacelli was an Italian painter who taught art at The Italian School in Vienna from 1939 to 1941. During their time together, Bach began painting landscapes, mainly of Italy. After she began to exhibit, her paintings became almost more successful than her compositions. Ciacelli died in 1966 and for a while Bach gave up creative endeavors, but eventually began to compose again. She received a gold medal for composition in 1962 and was awarded the title of professor in 1976. Death Bach died on 26 February 1978, possibly from inhalation of a gas leakage from her defective oven in her apartment in Vienna. Her papers are housed in the City Hall Library in Vienna.

Besides the S Patrone chambering, the S Patrone bore (designated as \\"S-bore\\") was also dimensionally redesigned. The S Patrone and its new spitzer bullet provided the accuracy and barrel life improvements the German military was looking for. As the bolt thrust of the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser is relatively low compared to many other service rounds used in the early 20th century, many arms originally chambered for the Patrone 88 could and were adapted for chambering the S Patrone by reaming out metal from the chamber as it required a wider chamber throat to take the differently shaped and thicker brass of the new S Patrone. Civilian use and offspring Civilian rifles were also chambered for the Patrone 88. After the adoption of the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser by the German military, the Patrone 88 was not abandoned by civilian users like hunters. German civilian gunsmiths kept trying to improve the chambering. They took a similar engineering approach as the German military used by reducing the diameter of the lands and grooves whilst leaving the Patrone 88 cartridge case itself unchanged. These efforts solved the problems the German military had experienced with the Patrone 88 and resulted and were finalized in what is now known as the 8√ó57mm I chambering. In 1939 the Normalisierungsverordnung (Normalization regulation) effectively prohibited the production of non S-bore/7.92√ó57mm Mauser chambered arms in Nazi Germany. In post World War 2 Germany the production of the various preceding chamberings is allowed again, but these chamberings have become rare in post 1939 produced arms.

It is located west-southwest of Las Cruces, New Mexico. It was closed in 1963. History Las Cruces Air Force Station was established as part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. The 685th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Las Cruces AFS by the 34th Air Division on 1 December 1954. The site consisted of 25 buildings, five barracks, 27 family housing units and several maintenance buildings. It was manned by eighteen officers and 208 airmen and NCOs. Facilities included a station theater, where films were shown four nights a week; an NCO club (soft drinks and beer only, no spirits were sold); a Library; a volleyball and badminton court; a swimming pool and a ping pong table and a baseball diamond. A small BX was available with limited goods and a small dispensary. By 1955, the Squadron began operating an AN/MPS-7 radar at this site, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. Over the next two years equipment additions and deletions included AN/MPS-8, AN/TPS-1D, and AN/MPS-14 radars. In 1958 the AN/MPS-8 and the AN/TPS-1D were retired. In addition to the main facility, Las Cruces operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * El Paso, TX (M-95A): * Columbus, NM (M-95B): * Sierra Blanca, TX (M-95E): * Gage, NM (M-95G): By 1961 the 685th was operating AN/FPS-20 search and AN/MPS-14 height-finder radars, and the AN/MPS-7 was retired. In March 1963 the Air Force ordered the site to shut down; operations ceased 1 August 1963. The site was turned over to the General Services Administration in August 1964 and was sold to private individuals in April 1965. Today, most of the station remains intact and in relatively good condition. It is used as the Dona Ana County Fairgrounds and speedway.

This is one of the only parishes in Connecticut that also serve parishioners who live in New York.  History The parish was founded in 1902. The original church was designed by the well-known church architect Joseph A. Jackson of New Haven and New York. The contractor, Max A. Dunschmidt, was locally famous at the time for his many building projects. The Shingle-style Gothic building had a clerestory 43 feet by 68 feet, a brick basement, and seating capacity for 150. The church was ready for use in October 1902. In 1942 the church acquired a two-manual pipe organ, opus 3145, from the Estey Organ Company of Brattleboro, Vermont. The fate of this instrument is unknown. By 1960 the church had become too small for its growing congregation and, although the earlier building was highly regarded, it was decided that a new church was needed. Plans for the church were put on hold, however, until a new school building was completed. The large circular church, a bit of a local landmark, was finally begun in 1969. The plans were supplied by local architect Joseph Chimblo.http://www.stpaulgreenwich.org/ChurchHistory.htm History of Saint Paul Church, Greenwich, CT Although Jackson's St. Paul Church of 1902 has been demolished, it is still mentioned frequently in the citation for the Greenville Historic District.

Mixing high and low brow culture and often autobiographical, his films and performances have been presented in over seventy-five cities, primarily in Europe. Writes Marilyn Stasio of Variety, ‚ÄúWatching Oberzan (on screen and in person) express his thoughts and damned-up feelings is funny as hell. And sadder than mere words can express.‚Äù Background Oberzan was born and raised in the small town of Saco, Maine in 1974. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1997 and moved to New York City to pursue a career in the arts. Major depression has both inspired and hindered his work. Works =Theater= A founding member of the New York City-based theater collective Nature Theater of Oklahoma, he collaborated in the creation and performance of several plays: No Dice (Obie Award), Poetics: a ballet brut, and the one-man show Rambo Solo, in which Oberzan breathlessly conveyed the plot and the pathos of David Morrell's 1972 emotionally sophisticated thriller First Blood, presciently predicting that, some day, he would make his own true-to-the-novel cinematic adaptation. In 2010, Oberzan's solo theater/film piece Your brother. Remember? premiered at Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels. An examination of family deterioration and redemption, the piece uses twenty-year-old home movie footage, recreated shot- for-shot in the present day, and employs the life of Belgian action star Jean- Claude Van Damme as a means to tell its bittersweet story. As of December 2016, Oberzan has performed the piece in over fifty cities worldwide. Ben Walters, Guardian UK, writes: ‚ÄúOberzan's 'Your brother. Remember?' is a brilliant piece of 21st-century art, an elegant mash-up of pop culture and the intensely personal, of live performance and the moving image, of memento mori and joie de vivre, the death wish and the creative impulse. It's funny, clever and profound.‚Äù In April 2012 Your brother. Remember? was released as a stand- alone film to critical praise. On Mr. Van Damme's 53rd birthday in October 2013, Oberzan's theater/film/musical, Tell Me Love Is Real, premiered at the International Arts Campus deSingel in Belgium, followed by a world tour. Having bizarrely overdosed on the anxiety drug Xanax at approximately the same time and under similar circumstances as Whitney Houston, Oberzan leans on the personages of Amelia Earhart, Serge Gainsbourg, Bruce Lee, Buddy Holly, Leonard Cohen, and a host of others to examine, through pop culture, timeless existential quandaries. Tages Anzeiger writes: ‚Äú'Tell Me Love Is Real' is a highly aesthetisized autobiography and deeply moving collage of film clips, live performance, and songs. Oberzan, the delicate extreme experimentalist, tells and sings and DJs his own story, understated yet unrestrained and heartbreaking. This is theater of the highest personal and sincere composition.‚Äú Oberzan's most recent work, The Great Pretender, a theater/film/concert inspired by Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami's film Close-Up and the persona of Elvis Presley, premiered in Belgium in December 2015 followed by a European tour. Writes Norway's Adressavisen, \\"Very funny, very sad, very strange, and very serious...A very impressive performance when [Oberzan] shows his stage personality Elvis/Oberzan in various stages of barbiturate intoxication, from the euphoric to the absolutely helpless, all disturbingly credible.\\"http://adressa.alda.no =Film= In 2007 Oberzan, burnt out from complete failure in the film industry, created his first feature film, a \\"one-man cinematic war,\\" Flooding with Love for The Kid. Meticulously adapting his favorite novel First Blood, Oberzan, as a metaphor representative of Rambo's own alienated and deeply frustrated struggle, shot, designed, edited, and portrayed all 26 characters by himself (including hunting dogs) in his minuscule Manhattan studio apartment, with a total budget of $95.51. Never intended for public viewing, the film eventually was discovered by both film critics and fans of First Blood, prompting a run at Anthology Film Archives in January 2010. Worldwide screenings and critical acclaim followed. Film Quarterly wrote: \\"Sheer logistic complexity...a thrilling and mind boggling experience.\\"William Johnson, Film Quarterly, Spring 2010 Vo. 63 #3. Pulitzer-prize nominated critic Matt Zoller Seitz released a video essay contrasting the film with the better-known Sylvester Stallone version. The New School Professor and Fulbright winner Carol Wilder devoted a chapter of her 2013 book Crossing the Street in Hanoi to Flooding with Love for The Kid. From her interview with Oberzan: \\"[Audiences respond] to my deep personal love for the story and its characters...[they have] a sudden new appreciation for the depth of the story of Rambo. That made me feel proud that I was offering this illumination. Spreading the Gospel, as I like to think of it. It's like, imagine if everyone thought Hamlet was a dumb story with dumb characters because they had never taken the time to read it? And I was able to show them the true depth and humanity of Hamlet. So my attachment and love of the book grew even more, being this conduit. People understand these projects because of their form and passion. They personally couldn't care less about Rambo, but they appreciate it as a vehicle for excellent storytelling. And I can live with that, because I've done my job, and I have forever embedded myself in the world of First Blood, a world of tremendous struggle and bloodshed, but also a world of boundless love.\\"Carol Wilder, Crossing the Street in Hanoi, University of Chicago Press, 2013 Oberzan began work on a follow-up film in 2008, again not intended for public viewing. Your brother. Remember? began as a film project, but soon morphed into a multi media piece involving live performance, film, and music. The live aspects were filmed during a performance in Vienna and coupled with the film footage to create a stand-alone film, premiering in New York City in 2012. Slant Magazine writes: \\"...A surprisingly sophisticated meditation on the specificity of cinematic representation and the impossibility of successfully reclaiming the past, as well as a secondhand character study as exhaustive and authentic as any in recent memory. That it does all of this amid Van Damme impersonations and toilet humor is what elevates it from a work that's merely accomplished to something like a work of genius.‚Äù A full film version of Tell Me Love Is Real, with live aspects filmed in Vienna and Berlin, premiered in Copenhagen in May 2016.

This battle resulted in a crushing defeat for the Anglo-Portuguese army, 4,000-5,000 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, while the Spanish had only 400 soldiers dead or wounded. Advancing from Elvas and passing the river Caya (Caia in Portuguese) the Anglo- Portuguese army had in front the Spaniards commanded by the Marquis de Bay. On 17 May and on the plain of La Gudina the two armies met. The Portuguese cavalry was routed with but slight resistance, and it left exposed two battalions of English foot, which were thus cut off and compelled to lay down their arms. Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway, who had a horse shot from under him, narrowly escaped being taken prisoner with them. The rest of the Anglo- Portuguese army made an orderly retreat to Elvas, maintaining their position there during the rest of the campaign, the danger of an allied invasion from the Portuguese frontier was staved off for the moment. Background After the defeat at the Battle of Almansa, the British situation was desperate, they were no longer present in the south-eastern territory of Spain and had minimum or no influence in the course of the war. Henri de Massue formally pressed London to send more reinforcements, and Britain responded sending 25,000 men. About 8,000 British troops were sent to Portugal under the orders of the Earl of Galway, and the rest to Catalonia. In Portugal, Galway met with the Marquis of Fronteira to prepare a combined attack against the Bourbon allies of Spain and advance toward Madrid. But for this, first they had to capture the city of Badajoz, a Spanish stronghold near the Portuguese frontier. In the past, Henri de Massue had already tried twice to capture the city without success. This time he did not take the risk. Knowing that France had withdrawn some troops as a consequence of defeats of Louis XIV in Flanders, his Anglo-Portuguese army crossed the border near the fortress of Campo Mayor, composed of maximum 20,000 Portuguese and 8,000 English, towards Badajoz. While his enormous supply train crosses the river Caya, the Anglo-Portuguese made contact with the vanguards of the Spanish cavalry in the fields of Gudi√±a. The allies, according to the Portuguese account, were 49 regiments of infantry and cavalry, against only 40 on the side of their Spanish opponents; according to the London Gazette, No 4538, about 17,000 foot and 5,000 horse in very good order, and, by the reports from the deserters, much superior in number to the enemy. The Spanish army were, by their published line of battle, about 24 battalions and 47 squadrons. The artillery of each party was stated as equal, or 20 pieces of artillery. The battle Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway, Marquis de Ruvigny, by Christoph Weige The allied army which had thrown nine bridges across the river Caya, were ready to do battle. In the center were deployed troops of the Marquis of Fronteira, but his troops were unable to see the Spanish infantry, unlike the cavalry. On the left flank, the first line was commanded by the Count of San Juan, and the second line was positioned under the command of the Earl of Galway, with three British regiments. The allies stretched this wing to take advantage of their numerical superiority, and thus outflank the opposing Spanish wing. After several attacks designed to attract Anglo-Portuguese forces, the Marquis de Bay, -who commanded the Spanish cavalry on the right flank- sent the Spaniards to attack the Portuguese in the first row. The very well trained and experienced Spanish cavalry made the Portuguese flee. The Count of San Juan desperately tried to reorganize its troops but failed and was captured. The Spanish cavalry also captured a battery of artillery. Lord Galway then launched an attack to take the battery with 3 regiments. The Spanish dragoons dismounted and engaged the English, which were forced to retreat. Because the Spanish cavalry was dominating the battlefield, the English attempted to retreat into a building. At that point, Galway jumped on a horse and fled. Lord Barrymore and General Pearse were captured. Practically every soldier of the 3 British regiments was either killed or captured. The Spanish cavalry pursued the Anglo-Portuguese, killing 1,500 and capturing 1,000. The first and second lines of the Anglo- Portuguese wing fled. English Col. Ally, who commanded the center, which had no cavalry, also took flight, even before the Spanish infantry arrived on the field. Leaving all the standards, as well as tents, baggage and guns on the field, he recrossed the river Caya, without destroying the bridges behind their passage. Aftermath King Philip V of Spain by Miguel Jacinto Mel√©ndez The Portuguese and British were severely defeated, with the loss of about 1,700 men killed or wounded, about 2,300 prisoners, 17 cannon, 15 colours or standards, as well as tents, and baggage. The Spaniards having had about 400 men, and 100 horses, killed or wounded. Of the 2,300 prisoners, the greater number, around 1,500, were Queen Anne's troops, and the remainder, or 800, were Portuguese. The highest ranking British officers made prisoners, were Major-General James Barry, 4th Earl of Barrymore, Nicholas Sankey; Brigadier- General Thomas Pearce; the 2nd Colonel of the Regiment of Galway, with Major Thomas Gordon of that corps; Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Meredith of the Regiment of Colonel Thomas Stanwix, and Lord Henry Pawlet, Aide-de-Camp to the Earl of Galway; the latter nobleman, (unfortunate here as at Almansa,) after having a horse shot out from under him, only escaping with difficulty.O'Callaghan p.272 The Allies were thus disappointed in the preparations they had made, of being able, through their superior numbers, to capture Badajoz, and had the additional mortification to witness above 30 leagues of the Portuguese territory placed under contribution by the Marquis de Bay, who subsisted his army at the expense of his adversaries, by the end of this campaign. So generally discreditable to the British did their intelligence from Portugal appear, that a contemporary London annalist says: \\"For my part, I think the stories, and excuses, sent us from thence, are as mean, and poor, as our fighting, and conduct, seem to be.\\" The victory, which led to such satisfactory results for Philip V of Spain, Brigadier Henry Crofton with his Regiment of Dragoons of 4 squadrons, was in the 1st line of the Spanish right wing of cavalry, by whose impetuous charge, upon their Portuguese opponents, it is states, that \\"all the cavalry of the 2 lines of the enemy's left was, in less than half an hour, broken, overthrown, and put to flight.\\" Notes References *Hargreaves-Mawdsley, W.

Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that a criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at a lineup held after indictment..R.A Allen, J.L. Hoffman, D.A. Livingston & W.J. Stuntz. Comprehensive Criminal Procedure, Second Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York: 2005, p. 255 Factual background On September 21, 1964, a bank in Eustace, Texas was robbed while two employees were inside. On March 23, 1965, Billy Joe Wade and two others were indicted for robbing the bank. Wade was arrested on April 2, 1965, and counsel was appointed to represent him on April 26. Two weeks later an FBI agent arranged a lineup at the county courthouse that consisted of Wade and five or six other prisoners. Wade did not have counsel present, and the two bank employees identified Wade as the robber.Wade, 388 U.S. at 219-20. At trial the bank employees identified Wade as the robber. The employees were cross-examined about the nature of the previous lineup. The defense moved for acquittal, arguing that the lineup was a violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The trial court denied the motion, and Wade was convicted. The Fifth Circuit reversed Wade's conviction, holding that the lineup in the absence of counsel was a violation of the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.United States v. Wade, 87 S.Ct. 81 (1966) Decision =Majority opinion= In Part I, not a part of the opinion because of the limited concurrence of Chief Justice Warren and Justice Douglas, Justice Brennan held that the lineup was not a violation of Wade's Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination.Wade, 388 U.S. at 223. The majority, however, observed that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel could be violated even in the absence of a Fifth Amendment violation. To safeguard a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial, counsel must be present at the critical stages of the prosecution.Wade, 388 U.S. at 227. The Court disputed the Government's characterization of the lineup as a preliminary stage, like the analysis of fingerprints, where counsel is not required. The Court noted that the lack of counsel at the lineup posed a risk of substantial prejudice to the defendant. Lineups could be very suggestive, and the uncounseled defendant would face serious difficulty in addressing any problems through cross- examination at trial because he would be unable to observe police action during the lineup. The Court also dismissed the contention that the presence of defense counsel would disrupt the activities of prosecutors. Instead, the presence of defense counsel would remove any taint of unfairness associated with the evidence. The Court noted that future regulation of pretrial stages with the adoption of police codes and other safeguards of fairness might render a stage not critical and vitiate the constitutional need for counsel.Wade, 388 U.S. at 239. Regarding the case at hand, the Court held that violation of the counsel requirement did not necessitate reversal of the conviction. The conviction could be upheld if the prosecution could show by clear and convincing evidence that the in court identification of Wade as the robber was based on the witnesses' observations of him during the crime. The Court vacated the decision of the Fifth Circuit and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.Wade, 388 U.S. at 240-43. =Clark's concurrence= Justice Clark observed that the conclusion that the post- indictment lineup was a critical stage of the prosecution was inevitable given precedents like Miranda v. Arizona.Wade, 388 U.S. at 243 (Clark, J., concurring). =Black's concurrence in part and dissent in part= Justice Black dissented from the holding that dismissed Wade's Fifth Amendment claim. Black asserted that being compelled to stand in a lineup is testimonial in the same sense as being called as a witness at trial.Wade, 388 U.S. at 245 (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Black agreed that the absence of counsel at the lineup was a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Black, however, thought such a violation demanded automatic reversal of Wade's conviction, and that the prosecution should not be given the chance to show that the in court identification was based on other evidence.Wade, 388 U.S. at 248-50 (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). =White's concurrence in part and dissent in part= Justice White agreed that there was no Fifth Amendment violation, but criticized the Court's Sixth Amendment analysis. White feared that the rigid rule of the majority would limit more nuanced, effective, and practical solutions at the state level.Wade, 388 U.S. at 241-59 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). =Fortas' concurrence in part and dissent in part= Justice Fortas agreed that it was not a Fifth Amendment violation for Wade to stand in the lineup, but that having each person in the lineup repeat words spoken by the robber during the robbery was a violation. Fortas agreed that the absence of counsel at the lineup was a Sixth Amendment violation.Wade, 388 U.S. at 260-62 (Fortas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Impact In response to Wade, police departments began to enact regulations to ensure the presence of defense counsel during lineups.Allen at 260Frank T. Read, Lawyers at Lineups: Constitutional Necessity or Avoidable Extravagance?, 17 UCLA L. Rev. 339 (1969) Hearings regarding the validity of police lineups are called \\"Wade hearings\\". In Kirby v. Illinois, the Supreme Court held that the absence of counsel at a pre-indictment lineup was not a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Because most lineups occur before indictment, Kirby has been seen as an effective overruling of Wade.J. Dressler & A.C. Michaels. Understanding Criminal Procedure (Fifth Edition).

The operation was spurred by the pirates' seizure of the South Korean chemical tanker . In response, the South Korean government sent a destroyer and 30 naval commandos to retake the ship and rescue its crew. After trailing the tanker for several days and fighting a preliminary engagement that neutralized four of the pirates, the South Korean forces retook the ship by force on January 21, 2011 in a successful boarding action that resulted in the deaths of eight and the capture of five out of thirteen pirates. Background On January 15, 2011, the Norwegian-owned chemical tanker Samho Jewelry was sailing through the Arabian Sea from the United Arab Emirates to Sri Lanka when it was attacked by a group of Somali pirates southeast of the port of Muscat, Oman. Tanker captain Seok Hae-gyun changed the ship's course to keep in international waters as long as possible. The pirates eventually seized the tanker and used it as a base from which to launch attacks on other ships. The South Korean operator of the vessel, the Samho Shipping Company, was facing huge losses because it was obligated to continue paying Norwegian investors under its charter even while the vessel was held by pirates. However, the Norwegian government had no military presence in the area at the time. Eight South Koreans, eleven Burmese, and two Indonesians were among the 21 crewmembers being held hostage. in July 2010. On January 16, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak issued an order to \\"comprehensively deal with\\" the crisis. The was dispatched under Captain Cho Young-joo, commander of the Cheonghae Anti-piracy Unit. The unit included members of the Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla. The 30 commandos aboard Choi Young could be deployed with several small boats and a Westland Super Lynx helicopter.Watts, p. 125 Additionally, warships from the United States and Omani navies were nearby. In contrast, the pirates were outnumbered with only 17 men aboard the tanker. They were also outgunned by the Koreans, possessing only assault rifles and rocket propelled grenades. Engagements Once Choi Young caught up with Samho Jewelry, it pursued the tanker until the pirates aboard were fatigued. Several fake attacks were staged to further wear down the pirate crew. Communications jamming was utilized to prevent the pirates from calling for assistance. =January 18= A South Korean Navy Westland Lynx in mid-2006. On January 18, the pirates aboard Samho Jewelry sighted a Mongolian cargo vessel about away. Four of the pirates embarked on a small motorboat to hijack it. With only thirteen pirates remaining behind, a group of ten commandos from Choi Young attempted to approach Samho Jewelry in a speedboat. However, three of the commandos were injured in the ensuing firefight and the speedboat returned to the destroyer. A Westland Lynx helicopter was sent after the hijackers in the motorboat heading towards the Mongolian ship. All four of the pirates from that confrontation were either killed or disappeared overboard. After the Mongolian vessel was able to proceed safely, the crew of Choi Young recovered the remnants of the hijackers' motorboat. Three rusty AK-47 rifles and an ammunition magazine were retrieved, along with three small iron ladders for boarding and various tools, including a screwdriver, a spanner, and several fishing knives. As the pirates had only six AK-47 rifles in total and three of them had now been confiscated, they had lost half of their firearms and about a quarter of their personnel. After this engagement, the South Korean military decided to initiate a boarding operation, as intelligence reports suggested that the remaining captors were exhausted and that additional pirates were being dispatched from Somalia to reinforce them. =January 21= The boarding of Samho Jewelry began on January 21 at 04:58 local time and took place at about from Somalia's coast. While Navy commandos used three fast boats to reach the tanker, the helicopter from Choi Young fired upon the tanker, killing several pirates. Once the commandos boarded the ship, the pirates, armed with AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, initiated a firefight that resulted in eight pirates killed and five captured; while the captain of the tanker was wounded, he was expected to survive. The U.S. Navy destroyer also assisted in the operation by evacuating the tanker's wounded captain via helicopter after the firefight had ended. In all, the operation took about five hours to complete. The rescue was called \\"a perfect military operation\\" by Lieutenant General Lee Sung-ho, Chief Director for Operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Republic of Korea. Aftermath After news of the incident reached South Korea, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak appeared on television and praised the South Korean military for its actions in the operation and issued a warning that it would respond strongly to anyone who threatened the Korean people. The operation was seen as a huge success by the media, who noted the strong response to the pirates in contrast to the South Korean government's response to several North Korean provocations that had occurred in previous months such as the bombardment of Yeonpyeong. It was reported that due to the strong show of force by South Korea to the hijacking, some Somali pirates intended to \\"seek revenge\\" for the South Korean Navy's actions. The pirates said that they would no longer attempt to hold South Korean-flagged ships and sailors for ransom, but instead attack the ships and kill the sailors. =Legal proceedings= It was announced on January 29 that five pirates captured in the operation had been transported to South Korea, where they were charged with attempted murder and maritime robbery. The investigation proceeded in the city of Busan, as both Samho Jewelry and her captain were based there. After interrogating the captured pirates, the Republic of Korea Coast Guard determined that the leader, Abdi Risqe Shakh, 28, and his lieutenant, Suti Ali Harut, had been killed during one of the two raids. The surviving pirates denied knowing one another, nor who had shot the captain of the tanker, though investigators suspected Arai Mahomed of being the gunman. The defendants faced charges of maritime robbery, attempted murder and ship hijacking. On May 27, 2011, Arai Mahomed was sentenced to life in prison, while three other pirates were sentenced to between 13 and 15 years in prison. The last pirate was tried separately, and received a sentence of 15 years in prison.

He and his family rebelled against the Byzantine emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602). The main source about him is John of Niki√ª..  Biography  Abaskiron was reportedly a native of Aykilah (Zawiya), a town in the vicinity of Alexandria in Egypt. He was born to a wealthy family, the eldest of three brothers. His younger brothers were Menas and Iacobus (Jacob, James). He also had a son, Isaac.. Abaskiron is first mentioned as a scribe. He might have been a scholastic (schoolman) and/or grammarian. John, the praefectus augustalis (Augustal Prefect, governor of Egypt) appointed Abaskiron, Menas, Iacobus and Isaac as overseers over areas of Egypt. They used their position to perform unauthorized attacks on the local representatives of the Blue faction of Chariot racing, going as far as sacking the towns of Bana and Bousir. They set fire on the Thermae of Bousir. The local prefect of Bousir managed to escape to Constantinople, reporting the situation to Emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602). Maurice directed John to dismiss Abaskiron and his family from service. They reacted by openly rebelling against Maurice. They led armed followers in seizing the grain ships heading to Alexandria, resulting in a famine within the capital of Egypt. The population of Alexandria rose against John, blaming him for the famine. His life was reportedly rescued by loyal members of the Coptic Church. John was briefly replaced by Paul, but then was reinstated and tasked with ending the rebellion. The activities of the rebels extended throughout Egypt. They continued to seize grain ships and confiscate imperial revenues with Isaac managing to form a naval fleet and raid Cyprus. His ships patrolled the Egyptian coast and attacked all ships still in imperial service. Eulogius of Alexandria (term 581-607) was sent to negotiate with the insurgents, to no real effect. John finally moved against them, alongside the general Theodore. By then, Abaskiron and his family controlled most of Lower Egypt. Theodore deduced that supporters of the rebellion were partly motivated by the recent arrest and imprisonment of two highly respected figures: Cosmas, son of Samuel and Banon, son of Ammon. He arranged for the release of the duo. Cosmas and Banon joined the Byzantine army in search of the Egyptian insurgents. The rival forces set camp on opposing sides of the Nile River. According to historian Edith L. Butcher, Cosmas and Banon \\"addressed the insurgents from across the river, entreating them to return to their allegiance, assuring them that the Roman Empire was not yet enfeebled or conquered, and that their ultimate success was impossible.\\" This encouraged many of Abaskiron's supporters to defect towards Theodore's camp. Butcher also states that: \\"The three brothers were left alone with their immediate adherents, but they boldly endeavoured to stand their ground, and met the attack of the Byzantine army with desperate courage. They fought till night fell, and then fled from the field to Abu San.\\" When Theodore managed to set fire to the rebel camp, more of Abaskiron's followers deserted. \\"Here [in Abu San] they made a brief halt, but with daylight discovered that they were pursued by the Byzantine army. The gallant little band retreated fighting towards Alexandria, but they were at length overpowered, and all three brothers, with Isaac, were taken prisoners\\". After being captured, Abaskiron and his brothers \\"were placed on camels and paraded about the streets of Alexandria, that all men might know the revolt had come to an end. Then they were thrown into prison; but the prefect, John, stood their friend as much as he dared, and no further steps were taken against them till long afterwards, by a new prefect, who succeeded John.\\" They were eventually executed under the orders of Constantine III. \\"This man cut off the heads of the three brothers, and sent Isaac into exile. The same prefect, probably acting under orders from the Emperor, who had evidently, neither forgotten nor forgiven the revolt, though he had not dared to use harshness at the time, confiscated the goods of the chief men who had taken part in it, and delivered the towns of Aykelah and Abu San to the flames.\\"  References   Bibliography  Category:Byzantine rebels Category:Year of death unknown Category:6th-century executions by the Byzantine Empire Category:Executed Egyptian people Category:Executed Byzantine people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:6th-century Egyptian people ","title":"Abaskiron"},{"id":"30554193","text":"Fred R.

She was a prominent figure during Rudolph's trial and sentencing, and has also become an activist for abortion rights. Early life Lyons was born in 1956 in Montgomery, Alabama. She received a degree in nursing from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a focus on reproductive health, after which she worked in various nursing fields and locations, and taught nursing at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. At the time of the bombing, she was director of nursing at the New Woman All Women Clinic in Birmingham, having originally answered an advertisement for a part-time nurse. =Bombing= The morning of January 29, 1998, Lyons was approaching the clinic, when Robert Sanderson, an off-duty police officer and security guard, bent to inspect an unfamiliar potted plant in the front yard. The flowerpot contained a remote-controlled nail bomb, which exploded and killed Sanderson immediately. Lyons was severely injured: one eye was destroyed and the other damaged, her hand was mangled, a hole was torn in her abdomen that necessitated the removal of 10 inches of her intestines, and most of the flesh was blown off her legs and hand. She was badly burned, her leg was shattered, and shrapnel and nails are permanently buried in her body. Lyons spent eight weeks in the hospital and has had over twenty surgeries; even years after the blast, she continued using a wheelchair and had poor hearing and eyesight. She does not remember the blast. Lyons and her husband, Jeff, were the focus of media attention after Rudolph's capture: Lyons expressed a hope of speaking to him and letting him know that he \\"failed.\\" Lyons initially wanted Rudolph to receive life imprisonment or the death penalty, but during the trial, spoke to news sources about her wish that he receive the death penalty and strongly objected to a plea deal. When Rudolph pleaded guilty and received life in prison, Lyons was \\"extremely disappointed\\" that he would not be put to death, but noted that other lives could be saved because Rudolph had revealed where he had hidden explosives, as part of his plea deal. Activism Lyons has said that the bombing \\"flipped a switch in [her] mind,\\" changing her from a quiet person into an outspoken activist. In 1998, she testified before Congress in support of applying the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to anti-abortion terrorists, and has spoken in other venues in support of the right to an abortion. In 2005, Lyons appeared in a controversial advertisement opposing the nomination to the Supreme Court of John G. Roberts, who seven years before the bombing had filed a brief opposing the prosecution of abortion clinic blockaders under the federal Ku Klux Klan Act. Those who advocated the use of the Act argued that the obstruction of access to abortion clinics violated the civil rights of women, and thus fell within the Act's purview; Roberts, then Deputy Solicitor General, had argued that the protesters were only trespassing and should be prosecuted under state law rather than federal law. The ad contained images of the bombing, and claimed that Roberts supported Rudolph and excused anti-abortion violence. Lyons spoke at NARAL Pro-Choice America's press conference opposing the Roberts nomination. She also spoke in opposition to the nomination of Samuel Alito. Lyons is the recipient of Planned Parenthood's Margaret Sanger Woman of Valor Award and the Ms. Foundation's Gloria Award. Media Lyons was the subject of a year-long documentary project by the ABC News program Nightline, filmed from the day of the blast throughout her recovery during her first year. Lyons's experiences also formed part of the 2006 documentary Lake of Fire, whose title comes from threats and hate mail Lyons received telling her that she would go to hell. Becoming Emily, a dance piece, is also based on her story.

The festival is held every year in June on the full moon day of Guru Purnima. On this day, devotees gather near the banks of the Indus River, which is known as the Sindhu River in India. Since 1997, the festival has stretched for three days, attracting large number of foreign and domestic tourists. The Sindhu Darshan Festival is held as a celebration of the River Sindhu. The main reason behind the celebration of Sindhu Darshan Festival is to celebrate the Indus River, as the river is an important historical icon in India and has been worshiped since the times of Ancient India. The Bollywood film Dil Se was shot during the first Sindhu Darshan Festival. Origin of the festival Lal Krishna Advani and Tarun Vijay a veteran journalist re-discovered the Sindhu river flowing through Ladakh, when they visited Leh in January 1996. Vijay conceived the idea of a festival on its banks as the river is the source of identity for India as the names India, Indian, Hindu and Hindustan are derived from Indus and Sindhu. Since then, the festival has been attracting people from all walks of life, castes, religions and places specially becoming a pilgrimage for Sindhi Hindus, who in pre-partition days, used to worship the river in their homeland of Sindh, now in Pakistan. Lal Krishna Advani, in 1996, himself a Sindhi, visited Choglamsar (8 km from Leh) and started the Sindhu Darshan Abhiyan, with handful of other Sindhis. Development of Ladakh Himalaya: recent researches By Prem Singh Jina. Pages : 129 to 132. The first time this event was held in the form of Sindhu Darshan Festival was in October, 1997. Year 2000 Sindhu Darshan Festival Later on in year 2000, on 7 June, Sindhu Darshan Festival was held with much pomp and show and was inaugurated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then the Prime Minister of India at Shey (15 km away from Leh).The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the Sindhu Cultural Center and also inaugurated the new office complex of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council. The Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said \\"Some people queried about existence of Sindhu in India as described in our national anthem but little did they know that it flows from our soil in Ladakh.\\" He further added : \\"Sindhu symbolised 5,000 years ethos of Indian civilization and its re-discovery will strengthen emotional integration of country.\\" and quoted hymn from Rig Veda: \\"Sindhu it might surpasses all the streams that flow - His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth, he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light, even as cow with milk rush to their calves, so other rivers roar in to Sindhu. As warrior king leads other warriors, so does Sindhu lead other rivers. Rich in good steed is Sindhu, rich in gold, nobly fashioned rich in ample wealth.\\" The occasion, was also marked by immersion of waters from Brahmaputra brought by Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister, Mukut Mithi. Brahmputra & Sindhu, both rivers rise from same source in Mansarovar. Festivities Every year, a large number of participants from different parts of the country participate in Sindhu Darshan Festival. They bring water from the river of their own state in earthenware pots and immerse these pots in the Sindhu River. The first day of the Sindhu Darshan Festival witnesses a reception ceremony for the participants, organized on the banks of Sindhu at Shey. This reception ceremony is conducted by a joint association of committees of various religious groups ( Buddhist, Shia, Sunni, Christian, Hindu and Sikh ) namely, Ladakh Buddhist Association, Shia Majlis, Sunni Anjuman, Christian Moravian Church, Hindu Trust and Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee, to promote national integrity. As a part of the ritual, fifty senior Lamas conduct a prayer on the banks of the river. A series of cultural programs is also presented by the artists from various states of the country. A sightseeing tour is organised for the participants and the day comes to an end with a bonfire at night. After the cultural programmes and sightseeing trip, a Puja is organized on the second day of the Sindhu Darshan Festival. On the third day, the participants get ready for the departure. Leh is popular with tourists, who visit the hill town to be a part of this grand celebrations. Postage stamp The Postal Department of Government of India issued a postage stamp depicting Sindhu Darshan Festival on 28 July 1999. The project 'Sindhu Darshan', was started to focus attention on the heritage of the ancient Indian Civilization and Culture that 'Sindhu' symbolizes. It aims to celebrate the Sindhu as a symbol of this country's ethnic diversity and to promote communal harmony. Further, attention is sought to be focused on cultural and topographical beauty of the landscape of Ladakh. These aspects are sought to be blended in the design of the First Day Cover which also carries inscription of the hymn 'mantra', chanted by Buddhists in the area, a prayer in praise of God. The stamp depicts a landscape in the upper reaches of the Sindhu with an inset of the 'Vrishabha' (bull) seal of the Indus Valley Civilization and a line, from the 'Rig Veda', describing the Sindhu.

History The church was edificated in 1348 along with a Dominican convent, and was originally dedicated to St. John the Baptist. In 1474 a fire razed it to the ground and in 1511 it was rebuilt to the current appearance. It was closed on 1806, a few years after the fall of the Republic of Venice, and reopened in 1813. It is currently one of the two main parish churches in the island of Murano. Description Wall of the church The fa√ßade is in naked brickwork, divided in three sections and with a 16th-century portal, which is surmounted by a large rose window. On the left fa√ßade is a portico with Renaissance arcades and columns, perhaps what remains of the original cloister. On the same side is the bell tower, dating to 1498-1502. The interior is on the basilica plan, with three naves divided by two series of large columns, and a wooden ceiling. The presbytery is quite large, with barrel vaults and two small side chapels. Aside from the high altar, there other minor altars, three for each nave. Artworks in the church include a Baptism of Christ attributed to Tintoretto, in the right nave, which also houses two works by Giovanni Bellini: an Assumption with Saints (1510‚Äì1513) and the Barbarigo Altarpiece (1488), taken from the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli. Palma il Giovane's San Nic√≤lo, Santa Lucia, San Carlo Borromeo also features on the right wall. In the right wing is the Ballarin Chapel, built in 1506 after the death of the eponymous glassmaker from Murano. Other paintings include a St. Jerome in the Desert by Paolo Veronese (also from Santa Maria degli Angeli), the Barcaioli Altarpiece by Giovanni Agostino da Lodi (c. 1500), a Deposition from the Cross by Giuseppe Porta, a 1495 Ecce Homo (perhaps from the destroyed church of Santo Stefano in Murano).

Plot Christian Diestl is at first a sympathetic Austrian drawn to Nazism by despair for his future but willing to sacrifice Jews if necessary; Noah Ackerman is an American Jew facing discrimination of the American kind; and Michael Whitacre is an American WASP who struggles with his lack of meaning arising from his lack of struggles. The three have very different wars: Diestl becomes less sympathetic as he willingly sacrifices more and more merely to survive; Ackerman finally overcomes the discrimination of his fellows in the army only to be nearly undone by the horror of the camps; Whitacre, still without meaning in his life, survives them both. Themes In a 1953 interview, Shaw commented, \\"what I was trying to do in The Young Lions was to show the world at a certain point in its history, its good and evil, and as many people as I could crowd into the book struggling through that world, trying to find some reason for trying to stay alive in it\\". He described the character of the German soldier Christian: \\"I wanted to show how a man can start out decent, intelligent, well meaning, as so many people in Germany must have been, even in the greatest days of Nazism and wind up bestialized, almost bereft of humanity, almost dead to the instincts of survival even, as the Germans finally were, by believing in one false thing, which spreads and spreads and finally corrupts them entirely\\".\\"Irwin Shaw, The Art of Fiction No. 4\\". The Paris Review. Winter 1953. Shaw said that, in addition to the three central figures of the novel, he had originally intended to include a fourth, non-human character a bullet which would act as a link between the other three characters. The novel would follow its origin from when the lead is mined from the ground, through to its manufacture and its journey to ending up in Whitacre's cartridge belt and finally used to kill Diestl in the novel's climax. But Shaw gave up the idea as \\"unnecessary and grandiose\\". Critical reception Orville Prescott of The New York Times wrote a very positive contemporary review, calling it \\"the best war novel yet written by an American ... Mr. Shaw is a natural writer. He is an acute observer of men at war. His ear for dialogue is excellent. He gives his major characters an immediate reality that is utterly persuasive.\\" Prescott's only criticisms were that the novel was \\"much longer than it needs to be\\" with a few too many minor characters that \\"slow down his story,\\" and that he found the women characters to be \\"generally unbelievable.\\" Kirkus Reviews also praised the novel in 1948, saying \\"If not directed at a popular level, this is the outstanding novel to have come out of the war, in the universality of its framework, its thoughtfulness, and its writing which is swift, believable and often brilliant\\".\\"'The Young Lions' (review)\\". Kirkus Reviews. 1948. Jonathan Yardley, writing in 2009 in The Washington Post, identified The Young Lions as one of the four epic American war novels that emerged in the immediate post- war era. The other three were The Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer (1948), The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk (1951) and From Here to Eternity by James Jones (1951). He wrote, \\"Today, at a remove of well over half a century, it is difficult to conjure the incredible excitement these books created, not merely the sense that the terrible war had inspired fiction of lasting importance but also the belief that the 'Great American Novel' at last was within reach\\". Yardley wrote that some of Shaw's short stories are minor classics and that portions of The Young Lions approached this level but as a whole, \\"it is too prolix and flabby to fulfill the high ambitions Shaw obviously had for it\\". Yardley believes that, like the other three novels mentioned above, Shaw's novel has more value as a document of war than as a literary accomplishment.Yardley, Jonathan (March 6, 2009). \\"The Fight of Their Lives, and Not Just on the Battlefield\\". The Washington Post. Also in 2009, Shaw's novel was included in the British newspaper The Guardian's list of \\"1000 novels everyone should read\\".\\"1000 Novels Everyone Must Read: The Definitive List\\". The Guardian. January 23, 2009. Film version The novel was adapted as a film of the same name in 1958 starring Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin. The film, while a success, made some major changes to the original story of Shaw's novel. In the film version, the character of the German soldier Christian is portrayed more sympathetically as a decent man who is deceived, rather than seduced and corrupted, by his country's Nazi rulers. Although the novel's character is increasingly hardened by his experiences and unrepentant to the end, the film's version grows ever more disillusioned and renounces his cause in the final scenes. Another major difference is that in the novel's final confrontation, Christian ambushes the two American soldiers, firing first and killing Noah and then being killed in turn by Michael; in the film, Christian, having thrown away his weapon after witnessing the horrors of a concentration camp, stumbles dazedly into the path of the two GIs and is shot dead on sight. As Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times in 1958 in a review of the film, the screen version is \\"prettier\\" than the novel and in the former, there is \\"no noticeable moral difference between the one German and two Americans\\".Crowther, Bosley (April 3, 1958). \\"Irwin Shaw's 'Young Lions'; War Story Is Offered at the Paramount Brando, Martin and Clift Are Starred\\", The New York Times. Shaw himself is said to have disliked the changes to his novel in the film version, in particular Brando's sympathetic portrayal of Christian and the playing down of the anti-Semitism that Noah encounters in the original book.\\"The Young Lions(1958) Notes\\".

It is situated on Frederiksberg Runddel, just left of the main entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens. History Ole J√∏rgen Rawert: Scene from the Royal Danish Horticultural Society's Garden , 17 September 1842 The Royal Danish Horticultural Society's first garden was located further down Frederiksberg All√´, at present day Haveforeningsvej which was named for it. In 1882 it moved to its current location, on land which used to be part of Frederiksberg Palace's nursery and vegetable garden. The former palace gardens had just opened to the public after a century as the private domain of the Danish royal family. The new garden was designed by the prominent landscape architect Henrik August Flindt who around the same time also designed √òrstedsparken, University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden and √òstre Anl√¶g in the grounds of the so-called Fortification Ring, the land which had until then been occupied by the city's now decommissioned Bastioned Fortifications. Over the years, different areas have gradually been restored and redesigned by some of the leading Danish landscape architects of their day. From 2001 to 2010 Jane Schul was director and principal architect of the garden. He has designed a section dedicated to different grasses (1992), a water garden and a perennials garden. Buildings =Well House= The Well House Br√∏ndsalen (English: The Well Hall) is from 1885 and was built around a well where members of the local bourgeoisie came to sample water with supposed healing properties before taking a stroll in the gardens. The water was thought to be good for health as well as for the digestion. This activity took place from 5 to 9 pm and afterwards the building was at the disposal of the Society. The building was designed by Peter Christian B√∏necke. He had previously designed J. C. Jacobsen's winter garden Pompei at the Carlsberg site and the Palm House in Copenhagen Botanical Gardens and the Horticultural Society specifically requested a building in the style of an Orangerie which would blend in with the surroundings. The co-existence was not free of complications and in 1909 the Horticultural Society acquired full ownership of the Well Hall, after which it was used for exhibitions and various other activities for its members. =Paradehuset= Paradehuset Paradehuset (English:The Conservatory) is one of the oldest greenhouses in the Copenhagen and traces its history back to the time when the area was still part of the palace gardens. When the Horticultural Society took over the site in 1882, one of the palace's old wineries was converted into a paradehus, a place for the exhibition of its many fine greenhouse plants. The building was modelled on the conservatories at Rosenborg Castle's vegetable gardens, with a long glass facade and roof facing south and a slate roof and workspaces to the north. Over the years, the building has undergone considerable alterations, most significantly in 1828-30 when it was extended, both in length and width, the glass gables were replaced and the current supporting iron. Later the roof under the rear side has been replaced and the entrance re-constructed. =Mielcke & Hurtigkarl= Restaurant Mielcke & Hurtigkarl In 2008 the chefs Jakob Mielcke Hansen and Jan Hurtigkarl opened the experimental gourmet restaurant Mielcke & Hurtigkarl in a listed 19th century building inside the gardens. The designers Henrik Vibskov, Margrethe Odgaard and others has created the avantgardistic interior design. Contrary to the dominating trend in Danish gourmet cuisine, the restaurant is known for its innovative use of exotic ingredients from around the world. It offers an eight course avant garde menu and a classical four course menu and has received acclaim from Danish food critics. The restaurant has also hosted outdoor events with music and free food in the gardens. The garden today The garden is open to visitors all day seven days a week and free of charge. The Well Hall still plays host to a long line of activities, including a popular, annual Christmas market, and various activities for members such as lectures and plant-swapping events.

It was later re-edited and screened on HBO as Every F---ing Day of My Life. The film chronicles the last five days of freedom for Wendy Maldonado before she and her son are sentenced for the manslaughter death of her husband and explores the years of domestic abuse the family experienced prior to his death. Background In May 2005, in Grants Pass, Oregon, Wendy Maldonado was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband, Aaron. According to Wendy Maldonado, the incident took place after almost 20 years of violent domestic abuse committed by Aaron against his wife and their four sons. Days later her eldest son, Randall (known as Randy), was arrested for his part in the killing. In 2006, a plea bargain led Wendy and Randy to plead guilty to the reduced charges of manslaughter. Wendy was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment and Randy to 75 months imprisonment. Before sentencing, Randy was detained in jail while Wendy was allowed home on bail to take care of her other three children. The film follows Wendy in the final days before she begins her sentence and includes home video footage of the family over the years of the Maldonado's marriage, and interviews with friends, family members and neighbors, some of whom witnessed the domestic abuse. Release One Minute to Nine was screened at the 2007 Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland, where it received Special Mention for Best Feature Length Documentary. The film was later re-edited by Geof Bartz for HBO Documentary Films and retitled it Every F-ing Day of My Life.The new title was drawn from the telephone call to emergency services that Wendy made immediately after killing Aaron. When asked by the operator if her husband had abused her, Wendy responded \\"every fucking day of my life\\". The re-edited documentary was screened on HBO on December 14, 2009.

The reference is on line 482. The text is generally considered a product of the religious syncretism characteristic of the Hellenistic and Roman Imperial era, as were the Mithraic mysteries themselves.Hans Dieter Betz, \\"Magic and Mystery in the Greek Magical Papyri,\\" in Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 252. Some scholars have argued that it has no direct connection to particular Mithraic ritual.Alvar, \\"Mithraism and Magic,\\" pp. 523‚Äì532, notes that Franz Cumont and Richard Reitzenstein immediately rejected the claim that the text was an authentic Mithraic liturgy; Alvar, who emphasizes the magical nature of the text, is among the 21st-century scholars who concur. Others consider it an authentic reflection of Mithraic liturgy,Marvin Meyer, \\"The 'Mithras Liturgy' as Mystery and Magic,\\" in Mystery and Secrecy in the Nag Hammadi Collection and Other Ancient Literature: Ideas and Practices (Brill, 2012), p. 447ff. or view it as Mithraic material reworked for the syncretic tradition of magic and esotericism.Hans Dieter Betz, The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\": Text, Translation, and Commentary (Mohr Siebeck, 2005), p. 37 et passim. The codex containing the text was acquired by the Biblioth√®que Nationale in 1857.Paris Biblioth√®que Nationale Suppl. gr. 574. It is thought to date to the early 4th century AD, though Dieterich proposed a date of composition as early as 100‚Äì150 AD. Its likely provenance in Egypt, where evidence of Mithraic cult is rare, presents a major obstacle to regarding it an authentic liturgy.Alvar, \\"Mithraism and Magic,\\" p. 532. Structure Marvin Meyer divides the Mithras Liturgy into two sections:Marvin W. Meyer, The Ancient Mysteries: A Sourcebook of Sacred Texts (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 212. Alvar, \\"Mithraism and Magic,\\" p. 525, follows the same structural outline while rejecting the identification of the text as Mithraic. Lines 475‚Äì750 are a liturgy for the mystic ascent of the soul through seven stages, and 751‚Äì834 provide instructions on how to enact the liturgy. The text begins by invoking Providence (Pronoia) and Psyche (\\"Soul\\") or in other readings Tyche.Hans Dieter Betz, The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation (University of Chicago Press, 1986), p. 48, note 79. The speaker of the invocation announces that he is writing down the mysteries to offer instruction and not for gain, and that he seeks a revelation of the universe and immortality guided by an archangelos (·ºÄœÅœáŒ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ, \\"high messenger\\") of Helios Mithras (lines 475‚Äì485). =Ascent= The ascent through seven grades is viewed by Meyer as representing Mithraic initiation, but it also bears a more general resemblance to the ascent of the initiate in theurgy, with parallels in fragments from the Chaldaean Oracles.Sarah Iles Johnston, \\"Rising to the Occasion: Theurgic Ascent in Its Cultural Milieu,\\" in Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium (Brill, 1997), p. 181ff. 1. Four Elements The speaker invokes the four classical primordial elements, punctuated by voces magicae, magical sounds, in the following sequence: * PPP SSS PHR[E], a popping and hissing sound characteristic of incantations *pneuma (wind, breath, spirit) * MMM * fire * ƒíY ƒíIA Eƒí * water * ≈å≈å≈å AAA EEE * earth * Yƒí Y≈åƒí These elements he refers to as \\"first origin of my origin\\" from which his \\"complete body\\" is made. He identifies himself by name, and by the name of his mother. The soul's encounter with the four elements is rehearsed as both generation and regeneration (lines 485‚Äì537).Alvar, \\"Mithraism and Magic,\\" p. 525. 2. Lower powers of air At this level (lines 537‚Äì585), the revelation-seeker is supposed to breathe deeply and feel himself lifted up, as if in midair, hearing and seeing nothing of mortal beings on earth. He is promised to see instead the divine order of the \\"visible gods\\" rising and setting. Ritual silence is prescribed, followed by another sequence of hissing, popping, and thirteen magic words: \\"Then you will see the gods looking graciously upon you and no longer rushing at you, but rather going about in their own order of affairs.\\" After a shocking crash of thunder, another admonition of silence, and a magic incantation, the disk of the sun is to open and issue five-pointed stars. The eyes are to be closed for the following prayer. 3. Aion and powers In this prayer (lines 585‚Äì628), the speaker again names himself and his mother, followed by an extensive list of translatable epithets such as \\"Light-maker\\" and \\"Fire-driver\\" interspersed with magic names. These are \\"planetary guardians of the gates of heaven\\". Among the invocations are Aion and Iao. An extensive series of vowels are pronounced \\"with fire and spirit.\\" After thunder and a feeling of physical agitation, another series of magic words elicits a vision of Helios. 4. Helios Helios is described as \\"a youthful god, beautiful in appearance, with fiery hair, and in a white tunic and a scarlet cloak, and wearing a fiery crown.\\" He is to be given the \\"fire greeting\\" (lines 628‚Äì657), and asked for protection while kissing phylacteries. 5. Seven Tychai The celestial doors are thrown open to reveal seven virgins dressed in linen and with faces of asps, an element identified as Egyptian. They carry golden wands, and are to be hailed individually (lines 657‚Äì672). 6. Seven Pole-Lords Next to come forth are the seven Pole-Lords, wearing linen loincloths and with faces of bulls. They have seven gold diadems, and are also to be hailed individually by name. These have powers of thunder, lightning, and earthquakes, as well as the capacity to grant physical health, good eyesight and hearing, and calmness (lines 673‚Äì692). The two groups of seven, female and male, are both depicted in an Egyptian manner and represent the \\"region of the fixed stars.\\" 7. Highest god In the midst of lightning and tremors of the earth, the highest god appears, youthful and bright in appearance, wearing a white tunic, a golden crown, and trousers. He holds the shoulder of a bull in what seems to be an astronomical reference (lines 696‚Äì724). His eyes project lightning bolts, and stars issue from his body. The instructions are to \\"make a long bellowing sound, straining your belly, that you may excite the five senses; bellow long until out of breath, and again kiss the phylacteries.\\" The encounter with the highest god is intended to result in divine revelation and apathanatismos, a technical term for the temporary achieving of a state of immortality.Meyer, The Ancient Mysteries, p. 212; Radcliffe G. Edmonds III, \\"At the Seizure of the Moon: The Absence of the Moon in the Mithras Liturgy,\\" in Prayer, Magic, and the Stars in the Ancient and Late Antique World (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003), p. 224. =Enactment and use= LInes 751‚Äì834 are instructions on how to enact the liturgy. The practitioner is warned not to misuse the mysterion (lines 724‚Äì834), and is given instructions on the preparation of magical accoutrements: a sun scarab ointment (751‚Äì778), the herb kentritis (778‚Äì792), and the protective phylacteries for the ritual (813‚Äì819). The section also offers some additional information and incantations. Magic context In Book IV of the Greek Magical Papyri in which the \\"Mithras Liturgy\\" occurs, lines 1-25 are a spell calling on Egyptian and Jewish powers in order to obtain information. Lines 1127-64 are a spell for exorcising a demon, using Coptic words of Christian origin, with instructions for preparing an amulet. Lines 1716-1870 are headed \\"Sword of Dardanos\\" and is a love spell. The Mithras Liturgy shares several elements found widely in magic as practiced in the Greco-Roman world, which drew on or claimed the authority of Egyptian religion and magic. These include the preparation of amulets and ointments, the timing of rituals based on astronomical phenomena or horoscopes, and the manipulation of breath and speech. Vocalizations include popping and hissing sounds for onomatopoeia, variations on the sequence of Greek vowels, glossolalia, and words that are untranslatable but seem to derive from or are intended to sound like Egyptian, Hebrew and other languages. The Mithras Liturgy is the only text in Betz's collection of the Greek Magical Papyri that involves a request for immortality. It is an example of the difficulties in distinguishing between the categories of \\"magic\\" and \\"religion\\" in the ancient world.A.F. Segal, \\"Hellenistic Magic: Some Questions of Definition: Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religions: Presented to Gilles Quispel on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday (Brill, 1981), pp. 354‚Äì355. Questions of Mithraic content The name \\"the Mithras liturgy\\" was given to it by Dieterich, who dedicated the edition to Franz Cumont. But Cumont could not see the text as being Mithraic in origin. Gee believes that its origins should be sought in this context, while Hans Dieter Betz thinks rather of a wandering philosophical origin.John Gee, review of Hans Dieter Betz, The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\": Text, Translation and Commentary, in Review of Biblical Literature (2005). Classicist Johan C. Thom notes that opinions regarding the context of the text differ, for example, Mithraism or another mystery cult, ancient magic, the Egyptian cult regarding the dead, or theurgy.Johan Thom, review of Hans Dieter Betz, The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\": Text, Translation and Commentary, in Review of Biblical Literature (2006). Mithraic scholars such as Cumont, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Martin P. Nilsson, and Walter Burkert do not identify the text as a Mithraic liturgy.The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\":Text, Translation and Commentary (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003). p.15 Cumont argued that the text lacked Mithraic eschatology, the Mithraic doctrine of the passage of the soul through the seven planetary spheres, and Mithras as a guide in the ascension.The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\":Text, Translation and Commentary (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003). p.12 Betz believes that the Mithras Liturgy is a product at the meeting-point of Greek, Egyptian, and Mithraic traditions, finally identifying the central 'ascent' section as a product of early Hermeticism.The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\":Text, Translation and Commentary (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003) Richard Gordon, however, doubts that Hermeticism influenced the text.Richard Gordon, \\"Probably Not Mithras\\", The Classical Review Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 2005) pp. 99-100. Marvin Meyer is certain that the text has connections to Mithraism and believes that it \\"contributes a great deal to the study of magic, miracle, and ritual in religions in antiquity and late antiquity, including Christianity, and the stories of miracles attributed to Jesus and others may profitably be studied with texts like the Mithras Liturgy at hand.\\" See also *Magic in the Graeco-Roman world References Further reading S.

He was involved in the theatrical world, and an associate of the playwrights Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. Life He was the eldest son of Henry Brett of Cowley, Gloucestershire. Colley Cibber, who was a close friend, says that the young Brett was sent to Oxford and entered at the Temple, but was an idler about town in 1700, when he married Anne, the divorced wife of Charles Gerard, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, who succeeded to the title in 1693. She was daughter of Sir Richard Mason, knight, of Sutton, Surrey, and married the Earl of Macclesfield, then Lord Brandon, in 1683, but separated from him soon after. She had two illegitimate children, one of whom, by Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers, was possibly the poet Richard Savage. The countess was divorced in 1698, when her fortune was returned to her, and two years later she married Henry Brett. He was very handsome, and the lady's sympathy is said to have been evoked by an assault committed on him by bailiffs opposite her windows. After his marriage Henry Brett was for a short time Member of Parliament for the borough of Bishop's Castle, in Shropshire. He also obtained in 1705 the lieutenant-colonelcy of a regiment of foot newly raised by Sir Charles Hotham, but parted with it soon after. Brett was a well- known member of the little circle of which Addison was the head, and which held its social gatherings at Will's and afterwards at Button's. He is supposed to be the Colonel Rambler of The Tatler (No. 7). He rebuilt Sandywell Park, which he sold to Lord Conway, and at one time had a share in the patent of Drury Lane Theatre (Cibber, Apology, p. 212). He survived his friend Addison, and died, rather suddenly, in 1724. Family After her father's death, Brett's daughter, Anna Margharetta Brett, who appears to have been the sole issue of the marriage, and who is described as a dark, Spanish-looking beauty, became the recognised mistress - the first English one - of George I of Great Britain, then in his sixty-fifth year, by whom she is believed to have had no children. The young lady's ambition and prospects of a coronet were disappointed through the death of the king in 1727, and she subsequently married Sir William Leman, 2nd baronet, of Northaw or Northall, Hertfordshire, and died without issue in 1743. Mrs. Brett lived to the age of eighty. She died at her residence in Old Bond Street, London, on 11 October 1753. She is said to have been a woman of literary tastes, and Colley Cibber is said to have submitted to her revision the manuscript of his best play, the Careless Husband, which was first put on the boards in 1704. Colonel Arthur Brett (whose daughter married Thomas Carte, the historian) is sometimes confused with Henry Brett.

The main sources about him are John Malalas and Theophanes the Confessor... Biography Ablabius was a son of Meltiades. Nothing else is known about his family, and Ablabius's exact status in society is uncertain. The primary texts describe him as \\"Œø ŒúŒµŒªŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÇ\\" (the Melistes). This Greek word has two meanings, one of them being a name for a musician, related to the term melody (\\"singing, chanting\\"). A comment of Theophanes implies that Ablabius was a member of an entire faction of such people. Alan Cameron suggests that this was a circus faction, affiliated to the Blues and Greens of the Hippodrome of Constantinople. The second meaning is \\"monetarius\\" (\\"mint master\\", moneyer/m√ºnzmeister); thus, an official of the imperial mint. This term derives from ŒºŒµŒªŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπ (melizei, \\"to cut\\"). Anastasius Bibliothecarius, who translated the chronicle of Theophanes to Latin, understood the term to have this meaning. Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange, an influential 17th-century historian, considered this the most likely meaning. Ablabius was recruited by Marcellus as part of a plot to assassinate Emperor Justinian I. The conspirators were apparently \\"important men in the business world\\" of Constantinople, and Marcellus himself was an \\"argyroprates\\". This term indicates either a silversmith (\\"argyros\\" is Greek for \\"silver\\"), goldsmith, or a banker. Another conspirator was Sergius, whose uncle Aetherius was curator of one of the imperial palaces, though better known for his part in a conspiracy against Emperor Justin II (r. 565‚Äì578). Ablabius received fifty pounds of gold for his role in the plot. The plot called for Ablabius to approach Emperor Justinian within the imperial triclinium (dining room). While Ablabius had access to the room, he was unable to approach the \\"sacred presence\\" of the Byzantine emperor without permission, and so he had to arrange matters with a palatine official. He entrusted his secret to Eusebius and John, but this led to the discovery of the plot by the authorities. when his requests aroused suspicions and were investigated. On 25 November 562, Ablabius attempted to enter the palace of Emperor Justinian armed with a dagger, and was immediately arrested. His further fate is not recorded. On hearing of Ablabius's arrest, Marcellus committed suicide rather than be captured, while Sergius sought sanctuary within the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae. Shortly afterwards, the reconstruction of Hagia Sophia was completed, and Paul the Silentiary composed a long epic poem known as Ekphrasis, for the rededication of the basilica. Paul mentions the conspiracy, stating that the conspirators were within the palace and about to attack when caught. He claims that God granted this victory to Emperor Justinian. Peter N. Bell notes that \\"Paul devotes some 30 lines (25‚Äì55) near the start of his poem\\" to the plot of Ablabius and another 21 lines (937‚Äì958) to further conspiracies of the time. Paul emphasizes that God takes care of the personal safety of the Byzantine emperor, and portrays both Emperor Justinian and his deceased wife, Empress Theodora, as intercessors of humankind in its relation with God.. Interpretation The motives of the conspirators are not addressed in primary sources. James Evans suggests they could be traced to the grievances of the business world with Emperor Justinian. The Lazic War against the Sassanid Empire had recently ended, and the peace terms required the Byzantines to pay an annual sum of 30,000 solidi to the Sassanids. However, the first seven years were to be paid in advance, and an estimated 2,900 gold pounds had to be delivered at once. Emperor Justinian required the businessmen to pay the money to the state in a form of a forced loan. The Byzantine treasury was reportedly crushed by debts and was still empty when Emperor Justin II (r. 565‚Äì578) rose to the throne. Instead of reducing further expenses, Emperor Justinian had increased pressure on the businessmen. In the summer of 562, money-changers, silver merchants, and jewel merchants found themselves required to put up \\"a costly display of lights\\" for the consecration of a new church dedicated to Theodora the Martyr. It is thought that this may have led directly to the assassination plot. On the other hand, Peter N. Bell connects the murder plot with the lack of popular support for Emperor Justinian in the final years of his reign. He points out that Agathias, Menander Protector, and Flavius Cresconius Corippus all paint \\"unflattering\\" and \\"gloomy\\" portrayals of the state of the Byzantine Empire during this period. Corripus even claims: \\"the old man [Justinian] no longer cared; he was altogether cold ... many things were too much neglected while [he] was alive\\". Corripus was making a comparison between Justinian I and Justin II, which might explain his negative view on Emperor Justinian. But his views are consistent with those of the other authors. Aftermath Sergius was eventually dragged away from his sanctuary and interrogated under torture. His confessions implicated two more silversmiths and a curator in the service of Belisarius, so that Belisarius himself came under suspicion and was arrested. He was placed on trial by Procopius, urban prefect of Constantinople; it is uncertain whether this was the same person as Procopius of Caesarea, the noted historian. Belisarius was placed under house arrest, while all his attendants were dismissed from service. Six months later, he was pardoned by Emperor Justinian I. Belisarius and Emperor Justinian died within a few weeks of one another in November of 565.

Life He was the son of John Balguy, and was born at Cox-Close 27 September 1716, educated at the Ripon Free School, and admitted to St John's College, Cambridge in 1734; was B.A. 1737, M.A. 1741, S.T.P. 1758. He was elected to a Platt fellowship at St. John's in March 1741, which he held till 1748. In 1744 he became assistant tutor to his friend William Samuel Powell, tutor and later master of the college, and gave lectures on moral philosophy and the evidences 'for sixteen years.' In 1743 he was deputy public orator, and in 1758 tutor to the Duke of Northumberland. He states in his father's Life that he owed all his preferments to Benjamin Hoadley, who had given his father a prebend of Salisbury. His father, as prebendary, presented him (1748) to the rectory of North Stoke, near Grantham in Lincolnshire, which he vacated in 1771 on becoming vicar of Alton, Hampshire. Through Hoadley's influence he obtained a prebend of Winchester in 1758, and became archdeacon of Salisbury in 1759, and afterwards Archdeacon of Winchester. Balguy was one of the admirers and disciples of William Warburton, and his name frequently appears in Warburton's correspondence with Richard Hurd. On Warburton's death in 1781 he declined the appointment to the vacant bishopric of Gloucester on the ground of failing health and approaching blindness, and died 19 January 1795 at his prebendal house at Winchester. A monument to him is in the south aisle of Winchester Cathedral. Works Thomas, less of a latitudinarian than his father, and opposed the agitation for a relaxation of the 39 Articles. In 1769 he published a sermon on the consecration of Bishop Shipley, which was answered by Joseph Priestley in Observations upon Church Authority. In 1772 he published an archidiaconal charge, in which he defended subscription to articles of religion; and in 1775 a sermon at the consecration of Bishops Hurd and Moore, which was answered in remarks 'by one of the prebendary clergy'. In 1775 he edited the sermons of his friend William Samuel Powell, with a Life of the author; and in 1782 Divine Benevolence asserted, part of an unfinished treatise on natural religion. In 1785 he republished his father's essay on Redemption, and a collection of sermons and charges. His discourses, edited by Rev. James Drake (a relation to whom his manuscripts were bequeathed), were republished at Cambridge in 1820.

ESMA replaced the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on 1 January 2011. It is one of the three new European Supervisory Authorities set up within the European System of Financial Supervisors. __TOC__ Overview ESMA works in the field of securities legislation and regulation to improve the functioning of financial markets in Europe, strengthening investor protection and co-operation between national competent authorities. The idea behind ESMA is to establish an \\"EU-wide financial markets watchdog\\". One of its main tasks is to regulate credit rating agencies. In 2010 credit rating agencies were criticized for the lack of transparency in their assessments and for a possible conflict of interest. At the same time, the impact of the assigned ratings became significant for companies and banks but also states. In October 2017, ESMA organised its first conference which was held in Paris. The event examined issues critical to European financial markets and was attended by 350 participants. The first company that became fully compliant with new ESMA regulations was London-based fintech startup capital.com. =ESMA's Product Intervention Measures= On 1 August 2018, the ESMA implemented modified trading restrictions concerning contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting for retail clients. The most significant change was that binary options will be completely banned while the CFD leverage that retail clients can trade with will be restricted to 30:1 and 2:1, depending on the volatility of the underlying asset traded. These restrictions applied to traders categorized as retail investors only. Experienced traders, which fall under the category of professional clients, were excluded. This also meant that professional clients did not receive the same investor protections as retail investors. The restrictions, initially imposed as a temporary measure, were renewed on 1 February 2019 for a further three-month period. On 31 July 2019, the ESMA announced that it will not renew the restrictions after they expire on 1 August 2019, as all the EU member countries have managed to implement similar restrictions on national level. = Questions and Answers (Q&A;) = To ensure the consistent day-to-day application of Union law within ESMA's remit, one of the organisations' key contributions is the production and maintenance of Q&As.; To open the process, ESMA launched in February 2017 a new process allowing stakeholders to submit a Q&A.; Once scrutinised, if these Q&As; are selected, they are published in English on ESMA's website.

History The church's origins date to 1188 when Ginevra Gradenigo, a noblewoman forced to become a nun by her father, donated to abbess Giacomina Boncio a land to build there a monastery. Demolished, rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1529, the church was then united to the monastery of Santa Maria di Piave in Lovadina, in the province of Treviso, which enriched the building. Henry III of France visited it in 1574. The monastery housed nuns from the most prestigious noble families of Venice. The convent was suppressed in 1810 and the church was closed in 1848, and deprived of most of its treasures. Restored in 1861, it was reopened two years later.

Although the adults feed on nectar, pollen and aphid honeydew, the larvae are active predators and feed on aphids and other small insects. It has been used in the biological control of insect pests on crops. Chrysoperla carnea was originally considered to be a single species with a holarctic distribution but it has now been shown to be a complex of many cryptic, sibling subspecies. These are indistinguishable from each other morphologically but can be recognised by variations in the vibrational songs the insects use to communicate with each other, which they especially do during courtship. Description The green lacewing eggs are oval and secured to the plant by long slender stalks. They are pale green when first laid but become gray later. The larvae are about one millimetre long when they first hatch. They are brown and resemble small alligators, crawling actively around in search of prey. They have a pair of pincer-like mandibles on their head with which they grasp their prey, sometimes lifting the victim off the leaf surface to prevent its escape. The larvae inject enzymes into the bodies of their victims which digest the internal organs, after which they suck out the liquidated body fluids. The larvae grow to about eight millimetres long before they spin circular cocoons and pupate. Adult green lacewings are a pale green colour with long, threadlike antennae and glossy, golden, compound eyes. They have a delicate appearance and are from twelve to twenty millimetres long with large, membranous, pale green wings which they fold tent-wise above their abdomens. They are weak fliers and have a fluttery form of flight. They are often seen during the evenings and at night when they are attracted by lights. The high green sensitivity of the superposition eyes allows the green lacewings to recognize fresh green leaves that they use to find honey dew produced by aphids, a site for egglaying and a resting place.Kral, K., Stelzl, M. (1998) Daily visual sensitivity pattern in the green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). European Journal of Entomology 95: 327-333. Life cycle Chrysoperla carnea larva The green lacewing adults overwinter buried in leaf litter at the edge of fields or other rough places, emerging when the weather warms up in spring. Each female lacewing lays several hundred small eggs at the rate of two to five per day, choosing concealed spots underneath leaves or on shoots near potential prey. The eggs are normally laid during the hours of darkness. The larvae hatch in three to six days, eat voraciously and moult three times as they grow. They feed not only on aphids but also on many other types of insects and even prey on larger creatures, such as caterpillars. They can consume large numbers of prey and completely destroy aphid colonies. When food is scarce they turn cannibal and eat each other. After two to three weeks, the mature larvae secrete silk and build round, parchment-like cocoons in concealed positions on plants. From these, the adults emerge ten to fourteen days later. The length of the life cycle (under 4 weeks in summer conditions) is greatly influenced by the temperature and there may be several generations each year under favourable conditions. Biological control A Chrysoperla carnea preying on a spider mite Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and honeydew and are not predatory, but the larvae have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They are considered to be important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass.Hoffmann, M.P. and Frodsham, A.C. (1993) Natural Enemies of Vegetable Insect Pests. Cooperative Extension, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. 63 pp. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It has been found to be effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan.Kareim, A.I., 1998. Searching rate and potential of some natural enemies as bio-control agent against the Bemisia tabaci (Homoptera:Aleyrodidae). J. Appl. Entomol., 122: 487‚Äì92 The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly. Although the larvae are effective as biological control agents, in open air environments the adult lacewings tend to disperse widely. They may remain in the original release location if they have sources of nectar, pollen or honeydew to feed on in the general vicinity. Commercial supplies of C. carnea or related species, usually eggs, are available from many outlets in North America. When attempts were made to introduce the species into New Zealand and India, the lacewings failed to become established, perhaps because of the absence of certain yeast symbionts necessary to their development which were absent from their new environments.

Life He born in 1807, was the only son of Thomas John Lloyd Baker (died 1841) of Hardwicke Court, Gloucestershire, and of Mary, daughter of William Sharp of Fulham, and niece of Granville Sharp. Like his father. Baker went to Eton and to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1826 but did not graduate. He entered at Lincoln's Inn in 1828, qualified as a magistrate for Gloucestershire in 1833, and soon afterwards became a visiting justice at the county prison of Gloucester. On succeeding his father at Hardwicke Court in 1841, he took an active part in the administration of other local public institutions, was one of the founders of the Social Science Congresses, started what is known as the Berkshire system for the suppression of vagrancy, was president of the chamber of commerce, and captain of the Gloucestershire squadron of the yeomanry cavalry. As a member of the old high church party, Baker contributed liberally to the restoration of Hardwicke, Uley, and other churches. He was deputy- lieutenant of Gloucestershire, and high sheriff in 1847‚Äì8. Baker's best known work was in connection with the establishment of the Hardwicke reformatory school. The Philanthropic Society and the Refuge for the Destitute had for years done much for the reformation of youthful criminals, and the Philanthropic Society had established a school in London; in 1848, on the advice of the Rev. Sydney Turner, then its superintendent, the Philanthropic Society's school was removed to the Farm school at Redhill, and reorganised on the lines of the French school at Mettray. Baker's attention had been drawn to the question by seeing boys in prison at Gloucester, and by a visit to the Philanthropic Society's school in London. In 1861, the whole question of the treatment of youthful offenders was considered at a conference at Birmingham, promoted by the town clerk, William Morgan, and Joseph Hubback of Liverpool. Among the results of this conference was the establishment of reformatory schools, by private philanthropists, in several places. With the help of George Henry Bengough (1829-1865), Baker opened a school at Hardwicke in March 1852, the first inmates being three young London thieves. The school was at first little more than a labourer's cottage on a small farm on Baker's estate; by 1854 there were seventeen inmates. Bengough, a rich young squire, worked for two years as schoolmaster, living in the house. The first Reformatory Schools Act was passed in 1854, enabling courts to commit to these schools, and the treasury to contribute to their support. Many particulars of Baker's work are given by Professor von Holtzendorft, who made his acquaintance in 1861, and published a book which was translated by Rosa Gibhard under the title, An English Country Squire, as sketched at Hardwicke Castle. A collection of Baker's papers, contributed to newspapers or read at meetings of the Social Science Association, was after his death edited by Herbert Philips and Edmund Verney in 1889, under the title, War with Crime. This volume contains a reproduction of a portrait of Baker at Hardwicke Court, by G. Richmond, R.A., which was presented to Mrs. Baker by the managers of English reformatories. Most of Baker's work related to the prevention of crime, in youth and in age, and many of the reforms which he advocated have been carried into effect. He urged that crime was due to a form of mental disease, and that the forces against it must be carefully marshalled if success is to be attained. Sentences should be apportioned on a scientific principle, the amount to depend rather on the antecedents of the prisoner than on the heinousness of the particular crime. He thought that, in the interests alike of the criminal and the public, a sentence of imprisonment should be followed by a term of police supervision. He deprecated the erection out of the rates of expensive buildings for reformatories, and held that only confirmed offenders should be sent to such schools. Baker's health broke down in 1882, and after that year he took no active part in public affairs. He died at Hardwicke on 10 December 1886. Family In 1840, he married Mary, daughter of Nicholas Lewis Fenwick of Besford, Gorcestershire; they had two sons: Granville Edwin Lloyd Baker (born in 1841, high sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1898) and Henry Orde Lloyd Baker (born in 1842).

The members are over 600 airport operators of all sizes in 58 European countries, over 90% of commercial air traffic in Europe. ACI EUROPE member airports welcomed over 2.3 billion passengers and handled 17 million metric tonnes of cargo and nearly 45 million aircraft movements each year since 1990. ACI EUROPE is a non-profit organisation. It is led by their non executive-general Olivier Jankovec, and has a team of 25 full-time staff. Its offices are in Square de Meeus, Brussels, Belgium. As one of the regional bodies within the global family that constitutes Airports Council International, ACI EUROPE is in regular contact with its sister organisations, including Airports Council International, ACI NORTH AMERICA, ACI ASIA-PACIFIC, ACI LATIN-AMERICA & CARIBBEAN and ACI AFRICA. History ACI EUROPE was formed in 1990, as part of a wider development which saw the creation of Airports Council International. European Airports had previously been represented by the Western European Airports Association (WEAA), which was integrated with two other international airport representative bodies ‚Äì Airports Operators Council International (AOCI) and International Civil Airports Association (ICAA) into the Airports Association Coordinating Council (AACC) in 1970. WEAA disbanded fully in 1985, while AOCI and ICAA remained in existence within the AACC until the Constitution of the new ACI was approved in the autumn on 1990 and came fully into effect on January 1, 1991. Policy Areas  Much of the ACI EUROPE membership is located within the European Union, which has a highly active regulatory environment concerning the aviation industry, relative to other regions of the globe. As a result, many of ACI EUROPE's policy concerns reflect those of the various decision making institutions of the European Union, alongside the concerns of the wider aviation industry. =Committees= Individual issues vary according to political and industry developments, however ACI EUROPE has six committees which address broad policy areas: * Facilitation & Customer Services Committee ‚Äì focused upon airports‚Äô efforts to improve the passenger experience * Aviation security Committee ‚Äì focused upon all issues concerning aviation security * Environmental Strategy Committee ‚Äì focused upon environmental issues, in particular carbon emissions, noise control, local air quality and intermodality * Technical and Operational Safety Committee ‚Äì focused on issues such as safety, airport capacity, [Single European Sky], airside operations, and slot regulation * Economics Committee ‚Äì focused on issues such as airport charges, key performance indicators, and competition issues * Policy Committee ‚Äì focused upon broader strategic issues affecting airports, encompassing some of the issues addressed in other committees. In addition ACI EUROPE has two fora ‚Äì The Commercial Forum and the Regional Airports‚Äô Forum. These fora address commercial concerns and the interests of smaller regional airports respectively. The Connectivity Challenge The Policy Outlook states that the aviation industry remains constrained by antiquated rules restricting market access and airline investment. The document supports the liberalisation of the European aviation market, and notes that the number of air routes has increased by 170% since the creation of the single aviation market in 1993.http://www.aci- europe.org/component/downloads/downloads/70.html This has facilitated the integration of new accession states into the EU. However remaining government- to-government restrictions on air routes, capacity, pricing and airline ownership and control need to be lifted beyond the EU. In particular regional airports and the communities they support would benefit greatly from the resulting increased opportunities for global connectivity. As well as additional routes, freer competition would allow the more efficient use of scarce slots and reduce dependency upon single carriers. Therefore, restrictive bilateral air service agreements and inadequate slot allocation policies should be abolished. ACI EUROPE supports the European Commission's efforts to fully liberalise international air services agreements at an EU level and in its Policy Outlook suggests that priority should be given to: # Full liberalisation with the United States of America and [Canada] # Achieving a pan-European and pan-Mediterranean aviation area comprising all EU neighbouring countries by 2013. # Initiating negotiations with the EU's main trading partners ‚Äì Brazil, Russia, India, China and Japan - at the earliest opportunity ACI EUROPE states that European airports are willing to participate directly in international aviation negotiations. Initiatives In addition to the actions of its committees, ACI EUROPE is involved in several specific initiatives which seek to further its policy interests. =Airport Carbon Accreditation= Airport Carbon Accreditation is the European carbon standard for airports. =Airport Collaborative Decision Making= Airport Collaborative Decision Making(A-CDM) is a joint venture between ACI EUROPE, EUROCONTROL and the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation which aims to improve the operational efficiency of all airport operators. =Single European Sky= ACI EUROPE is fully supportive of the Single European Sky project, and participates fully as the representative of European airports. Publications =Airport Business= Communiqu√© AIRPORT BUSINESS magazine is ACI EUROPE's quarterly magazine, containing policy and commercial news regarding airports primarily based in Europe. =Traffic Report= Traffic reports are published on a monthly basis, outlining the performance of the European aviation industry, from an aggregate level and to an individual airport level. =Special Editions= ACI EUROPE also produces special editions of Airport Business for major airports in Europe.

XL-15 Tagak (Swan in English) was a single-engine, twin-boom, high-wing monoplane designed after the I.S.T. XL-14 Maya and built in the Philippines in the mid-1950s. The result of a collaboration between a Government research institute and the Philippine Air Force, it was designed as a utility, liaison or ambulance aircraft and as a test bed for the use of local materials in aviation. Design and development In the early 1950s in the Philippines, the Institute of Science and Technology (I.S.T., previously known as the Bureau of Science) designed at least three different prototypes, both to investigate the scope for local aircraft design and production and to examine the use of indigenous materials in their construction. One such material of interest was Wobex (Woven bamboo experimental), a reinforced woven bamboo. The XL-15 Tagak was the second of these prototypes, developed in collaboration with the Philippine Air Force. It was a single-engine, high-wing monoplane with a twin-boom layout and tricycle undercarriage to enable easy access to the fuselage pod via rear doors. The inner wing sections, fitted with slotted flaps on the trailing edges had constant chord but further out the wings tapered, with slotted ailerons. There was a single lift strut on each side between wing and lower fuselage, with an airfoil profile to add to the lift from the wings. The fuselage of the Tagak was a wood and plywood framed semi-monocoque skinned with Wobex and ply. Its cabin, behind the 185 hp Lycoming flat six engine, was 3.26 m (10 ft 6 in) long to the rear of the pod. There were two front seats under the wing leading edge, two more behind and room for one or two (stacked) stretcher cases. The cabin had two windows on each side and the rear part of the pod, which projected behind the wing trailing edge, was also extensively glazed. The two tail booms, of all ply construction, were integral with the wing centre section. The fins, with long chord underside fillets, were integral with the booms. The tailplane was rectangular and extended beyond the fins, carrying a horn balanced elevator. The fixed surfaces were of wood and ply construction, with Wobex covering; control surfaces were fabric covered. Flight testing of the Tagak began in October 1954. By 1956 some small modifications had been made: rudder area was increased and a shimmy-damper added to the nosewheel leg. Only one was built.

The treaty, whose peace lasted less than one year, was the first in which the United States formally adopted the policy of attempting to acculturate Native Americans to European ways. The treaty site is located south of Medicine Lodge, around the confluence of Elm Creek and the Medicine Lodge River; it was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1969 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The Medicine Lodge Peace Treaty Site is located roughly south of the modern city of Medicine Lodge. The actual site of negotiations and treaty signings is located near the confluence of Elm Creek and the Medicine Lodge River, with Native American encampments (containing as many as 5,000 people) spread along both banks of the river. The area is in a combination of public and private ownership, and is most readily viewed at a distance, from the Memorial Peace Park about 1-1/2 miles to the east. There is a natural amphitheater facing west in the park, which is the site of periodic reenactments of the treaty events. In the years following the American Civil War, westward expansion into the plains of what are now Kansas and Nebraska placed pressure on the local Native American tribes, who contested the encroachments on their land with violence. A punitive expedition led by General Winfield Scott Hancock destroyed a Cheyenne village west of Medicine Lodge in the spring of 1867, leading to calls by peace-favoring politicians for negotiations toward some sort of long-term agreement with the affected tribes. The basic policy proposals worked out in the summer of 1867 included the settlement those tribes on reservations, where they could eventually be \\"civilized\\" and learn to adopt the ways of white men. The Indian Peace Commission was created by Congress in July 1867, given powers to agree to terms. In negotiations held here in October 1867, five tribes agreed to terms, which were formalized in three separate treaties known collectively as the Medicine Lodge Treaty. and The peace was to be short-lived, as neither side effectively held its end of the bargains, and by the following summer violence was again flaring up. The site of the treaty meetings was identified by a Kiowa spectator of the events in 1922 as being a grove of elm trees on the south bank of Elm Creek, just east of the Medicine Lodge River.

Nine candidates stood at the by- election, with McGuire predicted to win.Eddie McGuire's brother tipped for safe Victorian seat: ABC AM 19 February 2011 Results Labor won the seat with a majority of primary votes alone.

The site houses a design, research and development centre and extensive test track facilities and is used for the design and development of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles. The site, along with the smaller Aston Martin facility adjacent, occupies the land that was once the RAF V bomber base of RAF Gaydon. The British Motor Museum is also located on the same site. History By the middle of the 1970s, the government had closed RAF Gaydon. In the late 1970s British Leyland purchased the site to convert it into a vehicle development facility, and proving ground and it became the headquarters of BL Technology (BLT). In 1980 BLT awarded a contract for the construction of a wind tunnel there. The ownership of the site passed, along with what was by then called the Rover Group, to British Aerospace in 1988, and subsequently in 1994 to BMW. In 2000, the site was included in the sale by BMW of the Land Rover business to Ford. Ford, which at that time also owned Jaguar Cars and Aston Martin, established the new Aston Martin headquarters and design, development and production facilities on the site, and started to use the Land Rover facilities for some Jaguar work. When Ford sold Aston Martin into private ownership in 2007, the Aston Martin facilities on the site were included in the deal, the remainder of the site continuing to be occupied by their, by then, integrated Jaguar Land Rover development operations. Jaguar Land Rover is now owned by Tata Motors. The car park has 166 chargers for electric vehicles, at 7 kW AC each.

He was a devotee of the goddess Bagalamukhi and is said to have performed a great many miracles for his devotees and others. He stopped in Datia on 9 July 1929 after a nationwide journey . He then established the main deity in 1935 and observed penance for a period of 50 years until he left his earthly body(samadhi) on 2 June 1979, this time period was marked by a large number of events that showed his extraordinary knowledge and more than human capacities.

It is the site of the 1858 Marais des Cygnes massacre, one of the last major acts of violence in Bleeding Kansas before the American Civil War. and The site, now managed by the Kansas Historical Society, is a National Historic Landmark. Description and history The Marais des Cygnes Massacre Site is located in a rural setting of eastern Linn County, Kansas, about northeast of Trading Post. The park covers about , including the ravine in which the Marais des Cygnes massacre took place on May 19, 1858. The ravine is accessed by a short walk from the site's visitors center, and is marked by interpretive signage. The visitors center is located in a stone house, built in the 1870s by Charles Hadsall. Bleeding Kansas is the name given to the struggle between pro- and anti-slavery factions for control over the Kansas Territory following passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. The act specified that slavery in that territory would be determined by a popular vote of the territory's inhabitants. This inaugurated a scramble among proponents and opponents of slavery to settle the territory, leading to clashes over land and politics. Significant incidents of violence were minimal after 1856, but the Marais des Cygnes massacre was particularly noteworthy, for the execution-style slaying of five anti-slavery settlers, and the impersonal means by which the victims were chosen. The incident was immortalized by the abolitionist poet John Greenleaf Whittier. After the massacre, abolitionist firebrand John Brown built a log fort about south of the ravine; this structure no longer exists. The Hadsall house was built next to it in the 1870s. It was given to the state of Kansas in 1941, which turned it over to the Kansas Historical Society to operate in 1961.

They were deeply influenced by the artist Joseph Knight, who was a successful painter, etcher and photographer. He was the founder member of the Manchester School of Painters. Knight painted how he desired and refused to conform to traditional Art School rules and this appealed to his young admirers. Twice weekly they would all meet up at Knight‚Äôs studio in York Place behind the Union Chapel in Oxford Road, Manchester to discuss new ways to develop their techniques. The group were very discontented with the old school of teaching and working. They decided they would work in a different way, experimenting with different tones and colours especially after a number of them spent four months working in the open air in Pont-Aven, Brittany. The place was vibrant and full to the brim with an eminent and cosmopolitan crowd of painters known as the Pont-Aven School and the group became influenced by all their different ways of working.Catherine Puget and Julian Campbell, Peintres britanniques en Bretagnes, Musee Pont-Aven, 2004.

Manchester Guardian, English Art Education, 1887 Partington was so outraged he opened his own school in Stockport based on the same lines as the Acad√©mie Julian, Paris where masters and students worked together with a life model. The more they experimented the more criticism they received from the Manchester art critics and the old school of painters. It took them over ten years to establish The Manchester School and for them to be finally accepted by the critics. Joseph Knight Knight (1837‚Äì1909) was a member of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts, joining in January 1868. He withdrew in 1879 and was re-elected in 1883.

He often exhibited at the Royal Manchester Institution. In 1873 he became a full member of the Manchester Academy in which he played an extremely active business role for forty-three years. In 1889 he had a one-man exhibition at the Brasenose Club and in 1908 forty-five of his paintings were in a retrospective show at the Manchester City Art Gallery. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy and was awarded the silver medal at the International Exhibition in Paris.MAFA Cuttings Book, at Manchester Art Gallery, 2003. Spring - Manchester Art Gallery In 1899 the art critic Maxwell Enoch wrote the following about Hague's work: \\"He now paints with a delightful and delicate greyness, and has gradually become stronger in colour and more dexterous in handling. He paints in a manner that is absolutely his own. There is no landscape painter at present working in England who shows so much individuality in his work.

He worked in Russia, where it was several degrees below zero, North Africa and various parts of Europe. A former student of his, Laura Knight, described Jackson painting outside in the following way: \\"He would paint out of doors in any weather. Under the mittens he wore his hands were swollen, stiff and chapped, as were the edges of his ears and the wings of his nostrils.\\" Peter Phillips, The Staithes Group,(Oldham Gallery), 1993. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1880, and was a frequent exhibitor at the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts and Yorkshire Union of Artists.

He was educated at the School of Art under Mr. Buckley. He enjoyed travelling and made sixteen trips up and down the Mediterranean in coasting steamers. On these journeys he preferred to paint subjects with an archaeological interest. He was also an excellent landscape painter. His work was highly praised by the Manchester Courier's art critic when he made the following report on the R.M.I's exhibition on Modern Art in 1877. Surrey Pastoral, Manchester Art Gallery \\"His fine landscape representing a view near Milford in Surrey is one of the most complete and satisfactory landscape in the collection. It is remarkable for its agreeable tone and rich pearly quality of colour; some passages are remarkably fine, such as the middle distance, the tree work on the left of the canvas, and the beautiful turflike quality of the foreground. The whole canvas is full of light and atmosphere and full of bright promise for the future.\\"Courier, 16 October 1877.

Biography Mart√≠n y Coll grew up in a monastery and eventually became a Franciscan friar. The last years of his life were spent in the monastery of San Francisco el Grande in Madrid. He probably died there after 1733 and before 1735. Works Though primarily an organist, Mart√≠n y Coll also wrote a pair of treatises (1714 and 1734). However, his modern fame rests on four volumes of the Flores de M√∫sica (Musical flowers), a compilation of hundreds of keyboard pieces, nearly all of them without an author. Since the pieces were probably famous at the time of the compilation, listeners would have known the composer. Modern scholarship has been able to attribute a large number of the works to composers such as Corelli, Handel, Frescobaldi, Cabanilles, and Cabez√≥n. The fifth volume of the Flores de M√∫sica, called Ramillete oloroso: suabes flores de m√∫sica para √≥rgano, contains mostly organ music (as the title indicates). The works in this volume are generally assumed to be Mart√≠n y Coll's own compositions. Two of these works are variations on La Folia, a long Diferencias sobre las Fol√≠as and a shorter Fol√≠as.

It is Ferrari's first production four-wheel drive model. The body style has been described as a shooting-brake, a type of sporting hatchback/estate car with two doors. The FF has a top speed of and it accelerates from 0 to in 3.7 seconds. Ferrari states that the FF was the world's fastest four-seat automobile upon its release to the public. The FF costs US$300,000, with 800 being produced during the first year. Specifications =Engine= At the time of its introduction, the Ferrari FF had the largest road-going Ferrari engine ever produced: a F140 EB naturally aspirated direct injected 65¬∞ V12, which is rated at at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 6,000 rpm. =Transmission= The FF is equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and paddle shift system similar to the California, the 458 Italia, and the F12berlinetta. =Four wheel drive system= The FF's suspension and braking system along with the V12 engine The new four-wheel drive system, engineered and patented by Ferrari, is called 4RM: it is around 50% lighter than a conventional system, and provides power intelligently to each of the four wheels as needed. It functions only when the manettino dial on the steering wheel is in the \\"comfort\\" or \\"snow\\" positions, leaving the car most often in the traditional rear wheel drive layout. Ferrari's first use of 4RM was in a prototype developed in the end of the 1980s, called the 408 4RM (abbreviation of \\"4.0 litre, 8 cylinder, 4 Ruote Motrici\\", meaning \\"four-wheel drive\\"). This system is based around a second, simple, gearbox (gears and other components built by Carraro Engineering), taking power from the front of the engine. This gearbox (designated \\"power take off unit\\", or PTU) has only two forward gears (2nd and 4th) plus reverse (with gear ratios 6% taller than the corresponding ratios in the main gearbox), so the system is only active in 1st to 4th gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent Haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios \\"the clutches continually slip\\" and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque. A detailed description of the system (based on a conversation with Roberto Fedeli, Ferrari's technical director) has been published. Design =Exterior= rear three-quarters view The FF shares the design language of contemporary Ferrari automobiles, including the pulled-back headlights of the 458 Italia, and the twin circular taillights seen on the 458 as well as the 599 GTB Fiorano. Designed under the direction of Lowie Vermeersch, former Design Director at Pininfarina, and Flavio Manzoni, Ferrari‚Äôs Styling Centre, work on the shooting brake concept initially started following the creation of the Sintesi show car of 2007.\\"Ferrari‚Äôs new FF shooting brake\\" . Car Design News Live. Retrieved 2012-06-04. Distinctive styling elements include a large \\"egg-crate\\" grille, defined side skirts, and four exhaust tips. The shooting brake configuration is a departure from the conventional wedge shape of modern Ferrari automobiles, and the FF has been likened to the similarly-shaped 1962 Ferrari 250 GT SWB Drogo race car. The FF's exterior design produced a . =Interior= The combination of hatchback- like shooting-brake design and collapsible rear seats gives the Ferrari FF a boot capacity of between .

Among his most important works are Luxembourg's post-office building, the Limpertsberg Lyc√©e technique des arts et m√©tiers, extensions to the spa facilities at Mondorf-les-Bains and, of course, the ARBED building. The painter While Weis was a successful architect, he is now remembered first and foremost for his paintings. Even as a child, he decorated his letters with floral designs. When he was abroad, he followed art courses and studied watercolour painters, especially William Turner. He became passionately fond of watercolour painting, taking his brush and paints wherever he went. In Luxembourg City, he would often go down to the P√©trusse or the Alzette valleys, or out into the suburbs to find interesting scenes to paint. He often returned to paint the same spot when the light had changed, sometimes years later. His paintings are therefore of considerable documentary value. While most of his pictures are of the City of Luxembourg and its surroundings, he also ventured out across the whole country, painting scenes from the Moselle, the mining towns to the south and the mountains to the north. He also painted scenes in the countries surrounding Luxembourg as well as during his travels to Turkey, Tunisia, Greece and Yugoslavia. His earlier paintings, up to 1900, show the influence of his architectural interests, as buildings are depicted with accurate but rather boring precision. Thereafter, his own romantic post-impressionist style begins to emerge, especially in his work from 1915 to 1945. His warm colours predominate with an abundance of violets, blues and ochres. Weis mastered the art of capturing the moment, poetically reproducing the misty light of the early morning, the heat of noon or the haze gathering in the valleys at sunset. Little by little reality gave way to less precise, more suggestive images as Weis concentrated on the essentials. He would rapidly fill out the main lines of his scenes, interpreting them more and more freely until finally his pictures revealed a world of pride and prejudice.\\"Sosth√®ne Weis (1872-1941)\\" , Mus√©e National d'Histoire et d'Art.

Jones was born to Albanus A. and Jane (Thomas) Jones in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 11, 1842.Capt. Joseph T. Jones  Military service  In 1861, at age 19, Jones enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was assigned to Company H, 91st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. Jones served as Quartermaster Sergeant, Second Lieutenant, and First Lieutenant. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, Jones was appointed acting Captain.J. T. Jones ‚Äì Early Oil Region Producer In June 1864, at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Jones was wounded in both feet. He was sent home to Philadelphia to recover from his wounds and was discharged in September 1864.  Oil ventures  Although crippled from war wounds, Jones used his war-time savings and bank loans to begin drilling for oil in western Pennsylvania in 1865. After 12 dry holes, Jones finally hit oil in 1867. Jones fortune began to change in the Bradford oil fields with the development of more than 500 oil-producing wells and incorporation of the Bradford Oil Company.History of the counties of McKean, Elk, and Forest, Pennsylvania, with biographical selections To move crude oil to railheads, Jones invested in oil pipelines which produced greater dividends than the oil wells. By 1883, Jones was known as the largest crude oil producer in the United States. In the 1890s, Jones began investing in oil ventures in West Virginia, thereby increasing his wealth.  Mississippi investments  Through mutual friends, Jones heard of a potential investment in a railroad venture in south Mississippi, which included 63,000 acres (25,500 hectares) of southern yellow pines that were ready for harvest. Although the unfinished Gulf and Ship Island Railroad (G&SIRR;) was in bankruptcy, Jones formed the Bradford Construction Company with other investors and bought the railroad. Using his fortune from oil production, Jones finished construction of the G&SIRR;, bought out his partners in the Bradford Construction Company, and merged with the railroad to form the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad Company. Along with William H. Hardy, Jones co-founded the City of Gulfport as the railroad's southernmost terminal and had a deep-water channel dredged in the Gulf of Mexico, creating a harbor and the port of Gulfport.Gulfport Panorama in 1912, showing the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad Building (left) and Great Southern Hotel (right) Grimsley, Reagan (2016). \\"Reorienting the Piney Woods: rural and urban change in south Mississippi, 1830‚Äì1910\\" in Rural‚ÄìUrban Relationships in the Nineteenth Century: Uneasy neighbours?.

He had the Great Southern Hotel constructed in Gulfport to serve as his Gulf Coast residence, and nearby, an office building was constructed for the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad Company.  Death and legacy  By 1910, Jones was living with his wife and children in Buffalo, New York. He developed health problems during the last 3 years of his life and died on December 6, 1916 at his home in Buffalo. He was interred in the Jones Family Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery.Obituary: Captain J.T.

The name literally means \\"Uncle Claus\\" (as in Saint Nicholas). Despite the name and date, the tradition is not directly related to Sinterklaas, which is also celebrated on 5 December in the Netherlands. Rather, it is related to similar traditions on other Frisian Islands, such as Klaasohm on Borkum, Ouwe Sunderklaas on Texel, Opkleden on Vlieland, and Sunderklazen on Ameland.\\"Klozum\\", Gemeente Schiermonnikoog (Dutch)\\"Eilander tradities\\", SchierWeb (Dutch) During the feast, the islanders disguise themselves as \\"klozums\\" and visit homes on the island. The disguises are often as prominent locals, national and international celebrities, and fantasy and fairy-tale characters such as Arabs or cowboys. Both men and women disguise themselves. The klozums also distort their voice in order to further disguise their identity.Cees Tempel, \\"Sundrums, Klozums en andere gemaskerde eilanders\\", Stichting Toverbal (Dutch) The klozums begin visiting homes on the island around 8:30 p.m., alone or in groups. In order to welcome the klozums, the homes' front doors are left ajar and a lantern is lit or a curtain is left open. Once inside, the klozums put on a performance, acting out various characters or situations, often satirizing important events or decisions that have taken place on the island in the past year. After the klozums have departed, the inhabitants must guess who had been hiding behind the disguises. Klozum culminates in a demasking at midnight, when all the klozums drop their masks and disguises to reveal who they really are. The demasking is followed by celebrations lasting into the night. Although normally celebrated on 5 December, the feast is moved to the following Monday if the 5th falls on a Saturday or Sunday. The children on the island have their own Klozum feast on 3 and 4 December. The lytje klozums (\\"little klozums\\") visit homes during the afternoon, shouting \\"Klozum, Klozum\\", and put on an act or sing a song, earning them a reward of candy or cookies.\\"Folklore op Schiermonnikoog\\", Natuurinformatie (Dutch) Little is known of the history of the Klozum tradition.

He served at one time as Chamberlain of Scotland. Life Alexander was a member of the Baliol family, about whose pedigree confusion exists.According to the Dictionary of National Biography: He was certainly not Alexander, son of Hugh Baliol of Barnard Castle, an elder brother of John Baliol the king, for this Alexander died in 1279 without issue, leaving a widow, Eleonora de Genovra (Rymer, Thomas, F≈ìdera i.10, 779). It is probable, but not certain, that he was the same person as Alexander de Baliol, the son of Henry de Baliol, chamberlain of Scotland, who died in 1246, and Lora or Lauretta de Valoines, the coheiress along with her sister Christina, wife of Peter de Maule of Panmure, of the fiefs of the Valoines family in England. If so he can be traced in the records of Hertfordshire between 6th and 32nd Edward I in connection with the manor of Benington in that county, which he inherited through his mother (see Robert Clutterbuck, Hertfordshire, vol. ii.). This identification would account for his appointment to the office of chamberlain of Scotland, which had been held by his father, his great-grandfather, William de Berkeley, Lord of Reidcastle, and one of his maternal ancestors, Phillip de Valoines. But there are two difficulties attending it. Alexander de Baliol the chamberlain is never mentioned as possessing Reidcastle in Forfarshire, the estate of Henry de Baliol, and it is difficult to account for his constant association with the estate of Cavers in Teviotdale, and not with any English fiefs. Possibly the latter circumstance is due to the references being in the Scottish records. It appears that in 32 Edward I (1304) Bennington was sold by Alexander de Baliol to John de Binsted, and the conjecture seems admissible that Baliol may have made Scotland the chief place of his residence, though retaining English fiefs in right of his mother and his wife. His preference for Scotland would be confirmed by his succession to the high office which his father Henry had held. Alexander de Baliol the Scottish chamberlain appears as Dominus de Cavers in the Scottish records in 1270. Seven years later he was commissioned, as lord of Cavers, to serve in Edward's Welsh wars. As Alexandre de Balens, Balliol's arms appear in a roll of Scottish knights who took part in a grand tournament held for Louis IX of France at Compi√®gne.Michel, F. Les Ecossais en France, les Fran√ßais en √âcosse (1862) Note: Michel and other erroneously date the tournament as 1238, but Balliol and others mentioned such as King Alexander had not been born then In 1284, under the same designation of Dominus de Cavers, he was one of the Scottish barons who bound themselves to receive Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as queen in the event of failure of male issue of Alexander III. In the same year he received a summons to attend Edward's army, so that he must still have retained English fiefs. In 1287 he is for the first time mentioned in a writ by the guardians of Scotland as chamberlain of Scotland, an office in which he succeeded John Lindsay, Bishop of Glasgow. Two years later he took part in the negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of Salisbury, 6 November 1289, confirmed by the parliament at Birgham, 12 March 1290, by which Edward the Prince of Wales was to marry Margaret and Edward I solemnly recognised the independence of Scotland. Her death prevented the marriage, and Edward soon forgot or ignored his engagements. On 5 June 1291 Baliol and his wife Isabella de Chilham, widow of David de Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, received a letter of attorney and safe conduct from Edward permitting them to remain for a year in Scotland. He still continued to hold the office of chamberlain after the seisin of Scotland had been given to Edward I, as the condition of his determining the suit as to the succession of the crown of Scotland; but in the beginning of 1292 Robert Heron, rector of Ford, was associated with Baliol in this office. On 30 December 1292 certain of the records of Scotland which had been in the hands of Edward were redelivered to Alexander Baliol as chamberlain of Scotland. Baliol is last mentioned as chamberlain on 16 May 1294; disputes between Edward and John Baliol may have led to his deprivation by the English king after, or perhaps even before, the campaign of 1296, when Edward forced John Baliol to resign the crown and carried him captive to England. In 1297 John de Sandale, an English baron, appears as chamberlain of Scotland. Alexander having being captured at the Battle of Dunbar on 27 April 1296 and was only released upon agreeing to serve Edward I in a campaign in Flanders.Stevenson, Joseph (1870); Documents Illustrative of the History of Scotland from the Death of King Alexander the Third to the Accession of Robert Bruce. MCCLXXXVI- MCCCVI, Volume 2; p175 From entries in the accounts of the expenses of John Baliol when a prisoner in England with reference to a horse of Alexander de Baliol, it would seem that he shared the captivity of his kinsman. On 13 January 1297 Edward made a presentation to the church of Cavers, upon the ground that the lands of Alexander de Baliol were in his hands. A few scanty notices between 1298 and 1301 indicate that he took part on the English side in the war with Scotland; and from one of these we learn that he had manors in Kent, the wood of which he received the king's licence to sell. Alexander Baliol was amongst the barons present, under Edward I, at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. In 1303 he seems to have shown signs of again falling off from the English side, since his chattels in Kent, Hertfordshire, and Roxburghshire were in that year seized by John de Bretagne, Earl of Richmond, in the Scottish campaign. His estates in Kent, of which the chief was the castle and manor of Chilham, were held by him in right of his wife Isabella de Chilham, by whom he left three sons, Alexander, Thomas and William. The date of his death is unknown, but as he was summoned to all the parliaments of Edward I between 1300 and 1307, and is not mentioned as summoned to any of Edward II, he probably died soon after the accession.

The doctrine of a prisca theologia is held by, among others, Rosicrucianism.Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition by Glenn Alexander Magee Prisca theologia is distinguishable from the related concept of the perennial philosophy, although some inadvertently use the two terms interchangeably. An essential difference is that the prisca theologia is understood as existing in pure form only in ancient times and has undergone a process of continuous decline and dilution throughout modern times. In other words, the oldest religious principles and practices are held to be, in some sense, the purest. The perennial philosophy theory does not make this stipulation and merely asserts that the \\"true religion\\" periodically manifests itself in different times, places, and forms. Both concepts, however, do suppose that there is such a thing as a true religion and tend to agree on the basic characteristics associated about this.

Life Brett was probably the son or a relation of Captain Timothy Brett, with whom he went to sea in the sloop Ferret about the year 1722, with the rating of captain's servant. In May 1727 he followed Timothy Brett to the Deal Castle, and in the following November to the yacht William and Mary. On 2 March 1734 he was promoted to be lieutenant; in 1740 he commanded the sloop in the Mediterranean; and on 25 March 1741 was posted into the 40-gun by Vice-Admiral Nicholas Haddock, whom he brought home a passenger, invalided, in May 1742. In November 1742 he was appointed to the Anglesea, and in April 1744 to the 60-gun Sunderland. He was still in the Sunderland and in company with the Captain, Hampton Court and Dreadnought, when, on 6 January 1745, they fell in with, and did not capture, the two French ships, Neptune and Fleuron. The chase later brought criticism and legal proceedings instigated both by and against Captain Savage Mostyn of Hampton Court, but Sunderland had had her mainmast carried away at an early period of the chase, and Brett escaped opprobrium. He was afterwards sent out to join Commodore Peter Warren at Cape Breton, and took part in the operations which resulted in the capture of Louisburg. In 1755 he commanded the Chichester in the squadron sent under Rear-Admiral Francis Holburne to reinforce Edward Boscawen on the coast of North America. On 19 May 1756 he was appointed to the St. George, and on 1 June was ordered to turn over to . Three days afterwards a promotion of admirals came out, in which Brett was included, with his proper seniority, as rear-admiral of the white. He refused to take up the commission, and it was accordingly cancelled. No reason for this refusal appears on record, and the correspondence that must have taken place between Brett and the admiralty or Lord Anson has not been preserved. It is quite possible that there had been some question as to whether his name should or should not be included in the promotion, and that this had come to Brett's knowledge; but the story, as told by Charnock, of his name having been in the first instance omitted, is contradicted by the official list. From this time Brett lived in retirement, occupying himself, to some extent, in literary pursuits, translating the works of the Spanish scholar Benito Jer√≥nimo Feij√≥o y Montenegro. In 1777-9 he published 'Translations of Father Feyjoo's Discourses' (4 vols. 8vo) ; and in 1780 'Essays or Discourses selected from the Works of Feyjoo, and translated from the Spanish' (2 vols. 8vo). A letter, dated Gosport, 3 July 1772, shows that he corresponded with John Wilkes on friendly terms, and ranked himself with him as 'a friend of liberty.' He speaks also of his wife and children, of whom nothing further seems to be known. By seniority he was promoted to admiral on 29 January 1770. He died in 1785.

Life Brett was the son of a cabinetmaker, William Brett of Bristol, and was born in that city in 1805. Brett is known as the founder of submarine telegraphy. He formed the Submarine Telegraph Company in conjunction with his younger brother, Jacob Brett. After some years spent in perfecting his plans he sought and obtained permission from Louis-Philippe in 1847 to establish telegraphic communication between France and England, but the project was deemed too hazardous for general support. However, he was successful in connecting the two nations briefly by undersea cable in 1850. A more durable cable was laid in 1851, and the construction of numerous other submarine lines followed. Brett founded the English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company in 1850 which laid the first submarine telegraph cable to Ireland.Huurdeman, Anton A., The Worldwide History of Telecommunications, p. 129, Wiley, 2003 . He was involved in the transatlantic telegraph cable project and was confident that England and America would be linked, but he did not live to see it accomplished. Brett died on 3 December 1863 at the age of 58, and was buried in the family vault in the churchyard of Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol. Works Brett published a work of 104 pages, On the Origin and Progress of the Oceanic Telegraph, with a few brief facts and opinions of the press (London, 1858), and contributed several papers on the same subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he was a member. A list of these contributions can be found in the index of the 'Proceedings' of the society.

Life Brettargh was daughter of a Cheshire squire, John Bruen of Bruen Stapleford, father of John Bruen. She was baptised on 13 February 1579, and from an early age she was distinguished by earnest religious feeling. When she was about twenty she was married to William Brettargh or Brettergh, of 'Brellerghoult' - Brettargh Holt - near Liverpool, who shared her puritan sentiments. The couple were said to have had some persecution at the hands of their Roman Catholic neighbours. 'It is not unknowne to Lancashire what horses and cattell of her husband's were killed upon his grounds in the night most barbarously at two seuerall times by seminary priests (no question) and recusants that lurked thereabouts.' Her piety, however, was such as to impress them in spite of her dislike of their creed. 'Once a tenant of her husband's being behinde with his rent, she desired him to beare yet with him a quarter of a yeare, which he did ; and when the man brought his money, with teares she said to her husband, \\"I feare you doe not well to take it of him, though it be your right, for I doubt he is not well able to pay it, and then you oppresse the poore.\\"' It is perhaps characteristic of the times that her biographer insists upon the circumstance that 'she never used to swear an oath great or small.' After a little more than two years of married life she was attacked by 'a hot burning ague,' of which she died on Whit Sunday, 31 May 1601. She was encouraged by a visit from her brother, John Bruen, and by the consolations of William Harrison and other puritans. She was buried at Childwall Church on Wednesday, 3 June. Biographical coverage The short book that forms the chief authority as to her life is Death's Advantage little Regarded,Death's Advantage little Regarded, or the Soule's Solace against Sorrow, preached in two funerall sermons at Childwall, in Lancashire, at the buriall of Mistris Katherine Brettergh, 3 June 1601.

There is a portrait of her in Samuel Clarke's second part of the 'Marrow of Ecclesiastical History,' book ii., London, 1675, p. 52, in an elaborate ruff, the hair closely confined by a sort of skull-cap, over which towers a sugarloaf hat.

Established in 1888, it has an overall area of , and it is located in the historic centre of the city, inside the Zone 1 administrative division. The park is adjacent to the gardens of the Sforza Castle and to the Arch of Peace, two of the main landmarks of Milan. The very design of the park, due to architect Emilio Alemagna, was conceived with the intent of creating panoramic views encompassing both monuments. A third prominent monument of Parco Sempione is the Palazzo dell'Arte (\\"Palace of Art\\"), built in 1933 and designed by Giovanni Muzio, which currently houses the Triennale di Milano art expo. In the park are Arena Civica, the public aquarium, and the Torre Branca tower. The X Triennial Pavilion (1954) has been converted into a public library. History The Sempione Park is located where the Visconti ducal park or \\"Barcho\\" was once located. Near the Sforzesco Castle, the park was enlarged and enclosed by the Sforza to become more than 3 million square meters in area. The park was a forest composed mainly of oaks and chestnut woods and inhabited by exotic animals introduced by members of the house of Sforza.Informazione presa sui cartelloni informativi del parco With the fall of the Sforza and the Spanish occupation of Milan the park was abandoned and in 1861 was partly destined for agriculture. The area where the Sempione Park currently stands was instead used as a parade ground for the soldiers who were stationed near the Sforza Castle . The castle was used as a barracks, with consequent deterioration of the structures. During the Napoleonic era the architect Giovanni Antonio Antolini planned the construction of a large building complex around the castle, called \\"Foro Buonaparte\\" in honor of Napoleon;Pianta del progetto the project was never realized, and in its place the parade ground was transformed into a large lawn for civic use, adorned on the north-eastern side by the Arena, and on the north-western side by the Arch of Peace, point of beginning of the axis of the Simplon. After the unification of Italy, the military use of the area ceased,Grandi, Pracchi, op. cit., p. 67 and at the same time the city began to experience a demographic increase that required the construction of new neighborhoods. A real estate company proposed to redevelop the area of the castle (which was expected to be demolished) and the parade ground, similar to what was done in the area of the hospital, but the proposal caused strong protests from the citizenship of Milan. This led to the development of the committee established to draw up the first urban regulatory plan, developed up by the engineer Cesare Beruto (the Beruto Plan).Grandi, Pracchi, op. cit., pp. 67-70 This plan, which initially partially incorporated the building ambits on the area, was modified several times to allocate the entire parade ground to a public garden. For the castle a restoration was planned, with the intention to create a destination for cultural uses.Grandi, Pracchi, op. cit., pp. 70-71 The park, called \\"Parco Sempione\\", was built between 1888 and 1894 according to the project of architect Emilio Alemagna,Grandi, Pracchi, op. cit., p. 79 which provided avenues for carriage, a pond and a belvedere where the Biblioteca del Parco Sempione currently stands. The green was designed according to the romantic model of the English parks.Il Parco Sempione, comune.milano.it.

Life Brettell was born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, on 16 April 1793. His grandfather was an independent minister at Wolverhampton, and afterwards assistant to James Wheatley at the Norwich Calvinistic Methodist tabernacle. His father, Jacob Brettell, became a Calvinistic preacher at the age of seventeen, and after serving various chapels became an independent minister at Sutton-in-Ashfield in 1788. Here he renounced Calvinism, and in 1791 opened a separate meeting-house. In 1795 he became assistant to Jeremiah Gill, minister of the 'presbyterian or independent' congregation at Gainsborough, and on Gill's death, 1796, he became sole minister. He also kept a school (see notice by a pupil, E. S. Peacock, in Notes and Queries, 2nd series, xi. 378). He died 19 March 1810. His only son, Jacob, had been placed at Manchester College, York, in 1809. A public subscription, aided by the vicar of Gainsborough, provided for his continuance at York till 1814. He became Unitarian minister at Cockey Moor (now called Ainsworth), Lancashire, in July 1814, and removed to Rotherham in September 1816. He resigned in June 1859 from failing health. Brettell is described as a good scholar and effective public speaker. He was a strong liberal, and took an active part in the anti-corn-law agitation, being an intimate friend of Ebenezer Elliott (1781‚Äì1849), the corn-law rhymester. His poetry shows taste and feeling. His later years were tried by adverse circumstances. He died 12 January 1862. Works Brettell published: * Strictures on Parkhurst's Theory of the Cherubim. Against John Parkhurst, presumed his. * The Country Minister, a Poem, in four cantos, with other Poems, 1821, (dedicated, 12 July 1821, to Viscount Milton, afterwards fifth Earl Fitzwilliam). * The Country Minister (Part Second). A Poem, in three cantos, with other Poems, 1825. * The Country Minister; a poem, in seven cantos: containing the first and second parts of the Original Work : with additional Poems and Notes, 1827, (called 2nd edit.; Brettell's minor pieces are chiefly translations). * Sketches in Verse, from the Historical Books of the Old Testament, 1828 (one of these, on Balak and Balaam, was printed in Monthly Repository, 1826, pp. 360‚Äì7). * \\"Staneage Pole\\" (poem, dated Sheffield 24 February 1834, printed in Christian Reformer, 1834, pp. 182‚Äì4). * The First Unitarian, 1848, (controverting the opinion that 'Cain was the first Unitarian;' Brettell thinks Cain was 'the third Unitarian in strict chronological order'). Some of his hymns are in Unitarian collections. A harvest hymn, 1837, in which he calls the Almighty 'bright Regent of the Skies,' is in James Martineau's collections of 1840 and 1874 (altered in this latter to 'Lord of earth and skies'). Besides these, he contributed some hundreds of uncollected pieces, being hymns and political and patriotic pieces, several of considerable length, to the Christian Reformer, Sheffield Iris, Wolverhampton Herald and other periodicals. Family He married, on 29 December 1815, Martha, daughter of James Morris of Bolton, Lancashire, and had four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Jacob Charles Cates Brettell, born 6 March 1817, was partly educated for the Unitarian ministry at York, became a Roman Catholic, and went to America, where he was successively classical tutor at New York, minister of a German church, and successful member of the American bar in Virginia and Texas; he died at Owensville, Texas, 17 January 1867.

Opened in 1843, it forms the junction between the Rome‚ÄìCassino‚ÄìNaples railway and the Naples‚ÄìFoggia railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Caserta railway station is situated at Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi, to the south west of the city centre. History The station was opened on 20 December 1843, upon the inauguration of the Naples‚ÄìCaserta section of the Rome‚ÄìCassino‚ÄìNaples railway. It was built just opposite the Royal Palace of Caserta, to allow the sovereign to reach it more easily. On 26 May 1844, the station became a through station, when the next section of the Rome‚ÄìCassino‚ÄìNaples railway was completed, between Caserta and Capua. From the very beginning, the station played a key role in local and national transport, both for passenger and freight traffic. For a time, it was also served by a connector line (now disused) direct to the industrial area of the city. In recent years, there has been major modernisation work, including the deletion of a level crossing near the end of the platforms and the opening of an underpass. In addition, a huge underground car park was built at the nearby Piazza Carlo III. Features The passenger building is now a modern, two- level structure with a wide entrance and many windows. It hosts several services, all in large rooms, including ticketing, a bar, luggage storage and the office of the railway police. In the station yard, there are six through tracks used for passenger services, of which one is reserved for light rail service. The tracks are equipped with platforms and attached benches and shelters. The platforms are connected with each other by a pedestrian underpass. The station also has a goods shed served by several tracks, even though there is no longer any goods service. Elsewhere in the station yard, there is a locomotive workshop. Gallery Image:CASERTA 7.jpgStation yard, view of platform 1 looking towards Naples. Image:CASERTA 4.jpgStation yard, platforms 4 and 3. Image:CASERTA 9.jpgLooking towards Foggia and Cancello. Train services The station has about 5.4 million passenger movements each year. These movements are made up mostly of commuters, especially workers and students, but also of tourists who come to see the area, including the Palace, which has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997. All passenger trains passing through the station stop there, including Eurostar Italia and InterCity trains. The station is also the terminus of many regional trains to and from Napoli Centrale, Benevento and Piedimonte Matese. In the immediate future, some trains will be able to reach Napoli Campi Flegrei using the Villa Literno‚ÄìNapoli Gianturco railway. The station is served by the following services (incomplete): *High speed services (Eurostar Frecciargento) Rome - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Rome - Foggia - Bari (- Taranto) *Night train (Intercity Night) Rome - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce Interchange From the bus station at the nearby underground car park, many buses leave for neighboring destinations such as Capodrise, Portico di Caserta, Curti, Capua, Santa Maria Capua Vetere and many others.

One of his patrons, Frederick North, Lord North, made him President of the Board of Green Cloth. North and Brettingham had met as young men in Rome. The value of the appointment fell after the passage of the Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782, and North appointed Brettingham deputy revenue collector of the Cinque Ports, an office which yielded an income of several hundred pounds a year. His architectural practice was largely restricted to working for his father until 1769, when his father died, and after that it was limited in scope. In the words of Howard Colvin, \\"the income derived from his sinecures seems largely to have relieved Brettingham from the need to develop an extensive architectural practice.\\"Colvin, Howard (1995) ABiographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840: Third Edition, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, , p. 158 References Category:1725 births Category:1803 deaths Category:18th-century English architects Category:19th-century English people ","title":"Matthew Brettingham the Younger"},{"id":"30555954","text":"Macroglossum melanoleuca is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

Biography =Education= Like his uncle he spent a part of his early life in Italy, from where he returned in 1781. Brettingham's subsequent works, and the drawings which he exhibited on his return at the exhibitions of the Royal Academy, showed that he did not neglect his opportunities for study in Italy. Among them may be noted in 1783 a drawing of a sepulchral chapel from the Villa Medici at Rome, in 1790 the design for a bridge which he had erected in the preceding year at Benham Place, in Berkshire, and the entrance porch of the church at Saffron Walden restored by him in 1792. In 1773 he published another edition of his uncle's Plans, &c.; of Holkham, also, like it, in atlas folio, \\"to which are added the ceilings and chimney-pieces, and also a descriptive account of the statues, pictures, and drawings, not in the former edition.\\" Descriptive Account Brettingham wrote the descriptive account; as in the original edition, the plans are ascribed to Matthew Brettingham, and William Kent is ignored. =Works= Temple Of Concord, Audley End House The sudden death in 1790 of the prison architect William Blackburn, provided the great opportunity of Brettingham's life, and he soon gained a lucrative practice. Blackburn left many designs incomplete, several of which Brettingham subsequently carried into execution. He erected gaols at Reading, Hertford, Poole, Downpatrick, Northampton, and elsewhere. In 1771 his name appears associated with those of the leading architects of the time in the foundation of the Architects' Club, which met to dine at the Thatched House Tavern on the first Thursday each month. Other original members of this club included Sir William Chambers, Robert Adam, John Soane, James Wyatt, and Samuel Pepys Cockerell. About this time Brettingham also held the post of resident clerk in the Board of Works, which he resigned in 1805. His works for private patrons include the \\"Temple of Concord\\" in the grounds of Audley End House, a rectangular Corinthian imitation ruin built for Sir John Griffin in 1790 to celebrate George III's recovery from insanity, and a mausoleum in Scotland for the Fraser family. He also carried out work at Winchester House, St. James's Square, erected originally for the Duke of Leeds; 9 Berkeley Square, afterwards sold to the Marquis of Buckingham; Buckingham House, 91 Pall Mall, rebuilt in 1794 by Sir John Soane; Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square; 80 Piccadilly, for Sir Francis Burdett; Charlton, Wiltshire, for the Earl of Suffolk; Waldersham, Kent, for the Earl of Guilford; Felbrigg Hall, Norfolk, for the Hon. W. Wyndham; Longleat, Wiltshire; and Roehampton, Surrey, and Hillsborough House in Ireland, both for the Marquess of Downshire. Brettingham was held in much regard by his professional brethren, and was the esteemed master of many who later attained eminence in the architectural profession. He died in 1820.

Hybridization and forming of an indirect energy (hybridization) gap due to the coherent Kondo screening of the local moments by the sea of conduction electrons. In case of Kondo insulators the Fermi level (chemical potential) is located in the hybridization gap. In solid-state physics, Kondo insulators (also referred as Kondo semiconductors and heavy fermion semiconductors) are understood as materials with strongly correlated electrons, that open up a narrow band gap (in the order of 10 meV) at low temperatures with the chemical potential lying in the gap, whereas in heavy fermions the chemical potential is located in the conduction band. The band gap opens up at low temperatures due to hybridization of localized electrons (mostly f-electrons) with conduction electrons, a correlation effect known as the Kondo effect. As a consequence, a transition from metallic behavior to insulating behavior is seen in resistivity measurements. The band gap could be either direct or indirect. Most studied Kondo insulators are FeSi, Ce3Bi4Pt3, SmB6, YbB12, and CeNiSn. Historical overview In 1969, Menth et al. found no magnetic ordering in SmB6 down to 0.35 K and a change from metallic to insulating behavior in the resistivity measurement with decreasing temperature. They interpreted this phenomenon as a change of the electronic configuration of Sm. Gabriel Aeppli and Zachary Fisk found a descriptive way to explain the physical properties of Ce3Bi4Pt3 and CeNiSn in 1992. They called the materials Kondo insulators, showing Kondo lattice behavior near room temperature, but becoming semiconducting with very small energy gaps (a few Kelvin to a few tens of Kelvin) when decreasing the temperature.Kondo Insulators, G. Aeppli, Z. Fisk, 1992, Comments Cond. Mat. Phys. 16, 155-170 Transport properties At high temperatures the localized f-electrons form independent local magnetic moments. According to the Kondo effect, the dc-resistivity of Kondo insulators shows a logarithmic temperature-dependence. At low temperatures, the local magnetic moments are screened by the sea of conduction electrons, forming a so-called Kondo resonance. The interaction of the conduction band with the f-orbitals results in a hybridization and an energy gap \\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{g}} . If the chemical potential lies in the hybridization gap, an insulating behavior can be seen in the dc-resistivity at low temperatures. In recent times, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments provided direct imaging of band-structure, hybridization and flat band topology in Kondo insulators and related compounds.

More generally, the curved analogs of a parabolic geometry in this sense is also called a parabolic geometry: any geometry that is modeled on such a space by means of a Cartan connection.  Examples  The projective space Pn is an example. It is the homogeneous space PGL(n+1)/H where H is the isotropy group of a line. In this geometrical space, the notion of a straight line is meaningful, but there is no preferred (\\"affine\\") parameter along the lines. The curved analog of projective space is a manifold in which the notion of a geodesic makes sense, but for which there are no preferred parametrizations on those geodesics. A projective connection is the relevant Cartan connection that gives a means for describing a projective geometry by gluing copies of the projective space to the tangent spaces of the base manifold. Broadly speaking, projective geometry refers to the study of manifolds with this kind of connection. Another example is the conformal sphere. Topologically, it is the n-sphere, but there is no notion of length defined on it, just of angle between curves. Equivalently, this geometry is described as an equivalence class of Riemannian metrics on the sphere (called a conformal class). The group of transformations that preserve angles on the sphere is the Lorentz group O(n+1,1), and so Sn = O(n+1,1)/P. Conformal geometry is, more broadly, the study of manifolds with a conformal equivalence class of Riemannian metrics, i.e., manifolds modeled on the conformal sphere. Here the associated Cartan connection is the conformal connection.

It is located east-northeast of Moriarty, New Mexico. It was closed in 1961. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected this mountainous site near Moriarty, New Mexico as one of twenty- eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 1 January 1951 the 768th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Moriarty Air Force Station by the 540th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The station consisted of 54 buildings; 1 office building, 5 storage buildings, 5 barracks, 19 family housing units and 24 other buildings. The station had a branch of the Kirtland AFB BX, a theater, several service clubs, a library, swimming pool and tennis court. A housing area was built for married personnel. Initially operating an AN/CPS-5 radar, by September 1952 the 768th AC&W; Squadron operated AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 radars from the station. Six years later an AN/FPS-20 radar replaced the AN/FPS-3 search radar, and an AN/FPS-6 performed height-finding duties. In 1960 Moriarty Air Force Station was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration pending inactivation of the 768th, which was discontinued on 1 June 1961. The facility was turned over to the General Services Administration for disposal in 1962 and was turned over to the State of New Mexico and several private owners. Today what was the station is abandoned, and owned by the State of New Mexico. The remaining buildings are overgrown with vegetation and unused. It is used by the State Highway and Transportation Department for material storage and solid waste disposal. It contains misc equipment such as concrete barriers, old signs, etc. but no indications that they visit the grounds frequently. The remainder of the former station is used for livestock grazing. The remains of Moriarty Air Force Station consist of six buildings still standing on the site. The buildings are gutted and in a decrepit state due to neglect and vandalism. All other buildings have been torn down. The streets remain on the site in very poor repair.

In ancient times, Tyndis held close connections with Chera kingdom. The historic archives documented the Chera Kingdom as the powerful Tamil Kingdom whose turf extends the entire present-day state of Kerala, Kanyakumari and expanding up to Kongu Nadu. The perfect array of religions, customs, languages, and traditions over the flow of time reflects in the prosperous heritage of Malabar. Upon reaching the Tyndis port, they further traveled to the inlands using smaller boats and then by carts to the hill stations of Wayanad or Coorg, and then on wards in search of spices and precious herbs.

It is located east of Ozona, Texas. It was closed in 1963. History Ozona Air Force Station came into existence as part of Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. Ozona Was The Top 30 Air Force Stations. The 732d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Oznoma AFS by the 33d Air Division on 8 November 1956. It began operating an AN/FPS-3 search radar and an AN/FPS-6 height- finder radar at the station, and initially the station functioned as a Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In addition to the main facility, Ozona operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * McCamey, TX (TM-187A): * Comstock, TX (TM-187B): Ozona was closed in 1963 due to budget reductions. Operations ceased on 1 August 1963 and the squadron was discontinued. Today, what was Ozona Air Force Station is privately owned. The station is abandoned, the remaining buildings are frozen in time complete with electrical wires connected to substation which no longer remains. Most of the buildings that remain are in a very deteriorated condition. The former Air Force housing area is in use as single family residences, now called \\"Crockett Heights\\". Family's that live in \\"Crockett Heights\\" are currently living in old houses that the Military used as the barracks/houses. The houses residences live in, are rebuilt, and are in a perfect coniditon. Ozona AFS most important mission was during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

It is found relatively high on the seashore, in rock pools, and various cracks and shaded surfaces such as under rock overhangs in the intertidal zone. Description When underwater this sea anemone opens up to display numerous tentacles, arranged in three whorls. Out of water, the tentacles retract and the anemone closes to resemble a dome shaped red, crimson, brown, green or black blob of jelly, about across and high. This species was first described in 1898 by H Farquhar who wrote \\"Full-grown individuals in situations well exposed to the rays of the sun have a column greenish or brownish black, and the disc and tentacles dusky crimson, while those on the undersides of overhanging stones are reddish brown or crimson, the depth of colour varying according to the amount of light which reaches them.\\" Actinia tenebrosa is similar in form to the beadlet anemone (Actinia equina) of the northern hemisphere. The column has a number of iridescent blue spherules armed with nematocysts. Distribution and habitat The Waratah anemone is found along the coasts of southern Australia, its range extending from Perth to New South Wales. It is also found throughout New Zealand. It is found in cracks and crevices, under overhangs and under boulders on rocky shores, usually in the middle to low intertidal zone but occasionally higher up the shore. Biology A. tenebrosa The anemone on the right is closed. This species is viviparous and broods its young inside its body cavity. When the offspring are well-developed they are expelled through the mouth. The juveniles often attach themselves to rocks in close proximity to the parent forming clonal clusters. When these anemones are growing alongside each other they appear to know whether or not they are closely related. If they are, they will tolerate each other's close presence while if they are unrelated, they will attack each other. The Waratah anemone can also reproduce sexually with planktonic larvae settling far away from the parent individual. It may be difficult for these juveniles to establish themselves because of resident populations of cloned individuals that are highly locally adapted.

Burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England refers to the grave and burial customs followed by the Anglo-Saxons between the mid 5th and 11th centuries CE in Early Mediaeval England. The variation of practice performed by the Anglo-Saxon peoples during this period,Hutton 1991. p. 275. included the use of both cremation and inhumation. There is commonality in the burial places between the rich and poor - their resting places sit alongside one another in shared cemeteries. Both of these forms of burial were typically accompanied by grave goods, which included food, jewellery and weaponry. The actual burials themselves, whether of cremated or inhumed remains, were placed in a variety of sites, including in cemeteries, burial mounds or, more rarely, in ship burials. Within the areas of Anglo- Saxon settlement, there was both regional and temporal variation while burial practices.Lucy 2000. p. 10. The early Anglo-Saxons were followers of a pagan religion, which is reflected in their burials from this time, while they later converted to Christianity in the seventh and eighth centuries CE, which was again reflected in their burial practices, when cremation ceased to be practiced and inhumation became the sole form of burial, typically being concentrated in Christian cemeteries located adjacent to churches. In the eighteenth century, antiquarians took an interest in these burials, and began excavating them, although more scientific excavation only began in the twentieth century with the development of archaeology. Prominent Anglo-Saxon burials that have since been discovered and excavated include the early cemetery of Spong Hill in Norfolk and the great sixth-seventh century ship burial of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. History A map showing the general locations of the Anglo-Saxon peoples around the year 600, based upon Bede's account. The early Anglo-Saxon period in England lasted from the fifth to the eighth centuries CE, during which time burial was the common custom for disposing of the dead. Archaeologists believe that the treatment of the deceased was important to Anglo-Saxons due to the \\"rich variation\\" in burial rites from this era, and that different forms of burial reflect differences in the status, wealth, sex and/or gender, age, and tribal affiliation of the dead. There was greater variation in burial types than at most earlier periods of British history, with early Anglo-Saxon graves differing greatly from those found in the preceding period of Roman Britain. The common Romano-British form of disposal was inhumation, although some rare cremations had taken place. During the Anglo-Saxon migration, which began in the fifth century CE, Germanic-speaking tribes from continental northern Europe, such as the Angles, Jutes and Saxons, arrived in Britain, where their own culture‚Äîwith its accompanying language and pagan religion‚Äîbecame dominant across much of eastern Britain. Those Romano-British peoples still residing in these areas either adopted and integrated with this incoming culture or migrated westward. The Anglo-Saxons brought with them their own heterogenous forms of burial practice, which were distinct from those of the British peoples living in western and northern Britain during the Early Medieval, having more in common with those of pagan continental Europe. However, not all of those given an Anglo-Saxon burial at this time were necessarily migrants or the descendants of migrants from continental Europe. Some may have been ethnically descended from the earlier Romano-British people, but who had adopted Anglo-Saxon culture as it became dominant across southern and eastern Britain. An example of such cohabitation can be seen at Wasperton and Stretton-on-the-Fosse in Warwickshire, where Anglo-Saxon graves were found alongside those that were Romano-British in character. In the seventh century, foreign Christian missionaries initiated the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England, with repercussions for burial practices. Though common in the fifth and sixth centuries, cremation rapidly declined as a form of burial, with few known later examples. The Christian Church initially objected little to grave goods, although there was a decline in their popularity as they came to be understood as irrelevant. Instances of rich grave goods would however continue into the eighth century. Early Anglo-Saxon period =Inhumations= Inhumation at Sutton Hoo under archaeological excavation. The most common way for Anglo- Saxon communities to deal with their dead was through inhumation, the burial of the corpse straight into the ground. This form of corpse disposal would have taken less \\"time and equipment\\" than cremation. Such inhumations remain an \\"invaluable resource\\" for understanding Early Medieval society. In many cases, alkaline soils have led to the good preservation of the skeletal remains, enabling archaeologists to excavate inhumed corpses and gain \\"a great deal of information\\" from them. Data that can be gathered or inferred from Anglo-Saxon inhumations includes the biological sex or age of the individual, as well as information about their health or lifestyle. Isotopic analysis of the skeletons can be used to detect which region the individual grew up in. Graves for Anglo-Saxon inhumations varied widely in size, from \\"a shallow scoop in the ground to a large pit with regular sides over 2 m[etres] long and over 1 m[etre] deep.\\" Although most Anglo-Saxon inhumation burials were of individuals, it is \\"reasonably common\\" to find multiple burials from the period. These multiple burials most often contain a couple, quite commonly an adult and a child. In some rarer cases there were three or more individuals buried in a single grave. Positions The bodies in Anglo-Saxon inhumations are found in a variety of positions. They have been found \\"placed on the back (supine), front (prone), or on one side. The legs can be arranged straight out, be crossed at the lower leg or ankle, be slightly bent (flexed), or even pulled right up to the chest in a foetal position (crouched or contracted).\\" According to archaeologist David Wilson, the \\"usual orientation\\" for pagan inhumations was with the head to the west and feet to the east, although there are many exceptions to this. Those inhumations containing a corpse lying on their side may have been laid out such for various reasons. At Horton Kirby in Kent, it appears that the corpses were bent into such a position in order to fit into their small graves. Contrastingly, other examples show side-orientated bodies placed into graves \\"of ample size and sometimes of quite large dimensions.\\" Those Anglo-Saxon corpses that have been found prone, or face down in their grave, have been interpreted by some archaeologists as having been \\"live burials\\", where the individual was thrown into the grave and buried alive. Other archaeologists have interpreted such burials in different ways, leading Sam Lucy to claim that \\"There is probably no single explanation for the use of prone burial\\" amongst the Anglo-Saxons. \\"In some cases it may be accidental, especially if the burial was in a coffin which had been clumsily handled. In other cases it might have specific significance attached to it\\". Mutilations and decapitations In some cases, the body was mutilated prior to burial, primarily through decapitation, and there are examples of entire cemeteries being filled with such corpses, leading archaeologists to conclude that these were sites specifically for the burial of executed individuals.Lucy 2000. p. 75. There are few examples of these possible execution cemeteries from the early Anglo-Saxon period, with one exception being the barrow cemetery at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. Here, several burials containing the corpses of individuals who had been hanged, beheaded or in other way mutilated were placed around Mound 5 on the eastern side of the cemetery. Using radiocarbon dating, archaeologists have determined that the earliest of these may well date from the seventh century CE, and that they continued to be deposited at the site into the ninth and tenth centuries.Carver 1998 p. 137‚Äì139. Later examples of probable Anglo-Saxon execution cemeteries that date from the tenth or eleventh centuries have been found at Five Knolls in DunstableDunning and Wheeler 1931. and Bran Ditch in Fowlmere.Fox and Palmer 1926. p. 31.Lethbridge 1929. p. 87. There are also examples of decapitated corpses who have been buried in ordinary Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. One unusual example has been found at Loveden Hill in Lincolnshire, where one of the corpses had their head placed on their stomach, and an urn was placed where the head would have been.Meaney 1964. p. 158. At Great Addington in Northamptonshire, three decapitated skeletons had been found with stones in place of their heads,Smith 1902. pp. 241‚Äì242. while at Chadlington in Oxfordshire two corpses had their decapitated heads placed between their legs.Leeds 1939. pp. 357‚Äì358. At Mitcham in Surrey several inhumations contained extra heads, while other graves instead had none or had them placed at the corpses' feet.Wilson 1992. p. 93. In some rare cases, at sites in Bideford-on-Avon in Warwickshire and Portway in Hampshire, skulls had been buried on their own by the Anglo-Saxons, without their accompanying bodies.Wilson 1992. p. 95. Ritual elements Certain Anglo-Saxon burials appeared to have ritualistic elements to them, implying that a pagan religious rite was performed over them during the funeral. While there are many multiple burials, where more than one corpse was found in a single grave, that date from the Anglo-Saxon period, there is \\"a small group of such burials where an interpretation involving ritual practices may be possible\\". For instance, at Welbeck Hill in Lincolnshire, the corpse of a decapitated woman was placed in reverse on top of the body of an old man, while in a number of other similar examples, female bodies were again placed above those of men. This has led some archaeologists to suspect a form of suttee, where the female was the spouse of the male, and was killed to accompany him upon death. Other theories hold that the females were slaves who were viewed as the property of the men, and who were again killed to accompany their master.Wilson 1992. pp. 71‚Äì75. Similarly, four Anglo-Saxon burials have been excavated where it appears that the individual was buried while still alive, which could imply that this was a part of either a religious rite or as a form of punishment.Wilson 1992. pp. 77‚Äì80. =Cremations= Anglo-Saxon cremation was open and public, like that in contemporary South Asia (pictured). Alongside inhumation, it was common for early Anglo-Saxons to cremate their dead by burning the corpses and then burying the cremated remains within an urn. Cremation rites declined in the seventh century, but throughout that century remained a viable form of burial at sites like St Mary's Stadium in Southampton. Archaeologist Audrey Meaney suggested that cremation was performed to \\"release the spirit\\" from the body after death, while Howard Williams remarked that cremation rites presented \\"the public transformation of the dead body.\\" Archaeological understandings of the Anglo-Saxon cremation processes have been largely reconstructed from an osteological analyses of the cemeteries at Spong Hill and Sancton. The pyre sites are rarely archaeologically identifiable. The method of Anglo-Saxon cremation is still debated; based on an examination of cremated remains at Illington, Calvin Wells speculated that at that site, the bodies had been laid out on the ground, with a pyre then built on top of them before being set alight. Wells believed that this would explain why the shoulder tips of corpses at the site were not always properly cremated. This idea was criticised by Jacqueline McKinley, who argued that such a process would lack sufficient oxygen to cremate the entire body. Instead she argued that Anglo- Saxon cremation pyres were most likely a criss-cross of timbers filled with brushwood, with the corpse laid on top. The process of cremating the body would likely have been visible to onlookers, creating a connection between living and dead. Following the cremation, the ashes and remains would have been collected and placed within an urn. It is not known how long the urn was kept before being buried; it is \\"very possible\\" that in certain cases they were stored above ground for \\"long periods of time\\". When buried, the urns were most often placed upright, although in a few rare examples they were instead inverted. At times they were buried individually, each in their own pit, although in other cases, several urns were clustered together in a burial pit. Burial urns and grave goods Anglo-Saxon burial urns were typically hand-made out of pottery, and often decorated with various motifs. These included bosses, stamps and linear incised marks, as well as freehand designs. The most notable of these motifs was the swastika, which was widely inscribed not only on crematory urns but also on certain pieces of weaponry, various brooches and other forms of (often female) jewellery. Archaeologist David Wilson remarked that the swastika \\"undoubtedly had special importance\\", suggesting that it was the symbol of the pagan god Thunor. He accepted that through increasing usage, it might have become a \\"purely decorative device with no real symbolic importance.\\" Another symbol that appears on urns and other artefacts is the rune ; this represented the letter T and has been associated with the god Tiw. Funerary urn from the Snape Anglo-Saxon Cemetery. In rare cases, such as at Baston, Lincolnshire,Mayes and Dean 1976. and Drayton, Norfolk,Smith 1901. pp. 333‚Äì334. lids were made for these urns; the most elaborate known example - from Spong Hill, Norfolk - is decorated with a seated human figure with its head in its hands.Hills, Penn and Rickett. 1987. pp. 162. Several examples used stones as lids.Lucy 2000. 114. There are also a number of cases where \\"window urns\\" have been uncovered, containing pieces of glass inserted into the fabric of the pottery. Examples of this have been found at such sites as Castle Acre in Norfolk,Meaney 1964. p. 172. Helpston in Nottinghamshire,Meaney 1964. pp. 189‚Äì190. and Haslington in Cambridgeshire.Lethbridge 1938. p. 313. There are also a few rare cases, such as at Cleatham in Lincolnshire,Field 1989. p. 53. where instead of making a new pot to bury cremated remains in, Anglo-Saxon peoples re-used older Late Romano-British period urns or pots in their funerary rites.Lucy 2000. p. 115. In certain cases, pottery urns were substituted by bronze bowls, with examples being found at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk, at Coombe in Kent,Ellis Davidson and Webster 1967. at Illington in Norfolk,Clarke 1957. p. 406. and at Snape in Suffolk.West and Owles 1973. Like inhumations, cremated remains were sometimes deposited along with grave goods, however sites containing grave goods constitute only \\"about half of the known cremations\\". Sometimes, these items were placed on the cremation pyre along with the corpse, and were therefore damaged by the fire. They were then placed, along with the skeletal remains, within an urn for burial. At other times, these grave goods were placed inside the urn unburnt, meaning that they remained intact and undamaged. The most common grave goods placed in cremation graves were \\"toilet implements\\", among them bronze and iron tweezers, razors and blades, shears and ear-scoops; some were full-sized, but others were miniatures of no practical use. Also common were bone and antler combs, some of which had been deliberately broken prior to inclusion. Burial places =Cemeteries= Archaeologists know of the existence of around 1,200 Anglo-Saxon cemeteries across England.Hutton 1991. p. 276. Archaeological investigation has displayed that structures or buildings were built inside a number of pagan cemeteries, and as David Wilson noted, \\"The evidence, then, from cemetery excavations is suggestive of small structures and features, some of which may perhaps be interpreted as shrines or sacred areas\\".Wilson 1992. p. 63. In some cases, there is evidence of far smaller structures being built around or alongside individual graves, implying possible small shrines to the dead individual or individuals buried there.Wilson 1992. p. 53. At the cemetery of Apple Down in Sussex, four-post structures were discovered, mostly situated over cremations, and the excavators Down and Welch theorised that these were the remains of small, roofed huts that contained the cremated deposits of a single family.Down and Welch 1990. pp. 25‚Äì29. =Barrow burials= Mound 2 is the only Sutton Hoo tumulus to have been reconstructed to its supposed original height. In the late sixth century, well over a century after the Anglo-Saxon peoples had become dominant in eastern Britain, they adopted a new burial practice for the deceased members of the wealthy social elite: their burial in tumuli, which are also known as barrows or burial mounds. This practice had been adopted by the members of the Merovingian dynasty who ruled the Franks in Francia (modern France) during the fifth century. During the sixth century, they had gained increasing influence over the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Kent, eventually leading to a marriage alliance between the two. The Kentish elites subsequently adopted the practice of tumuli burial, and from here it spread north of the Thames, being adopted by the elites in other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.Pollington 2008. p. 28. It has also been suggested that some of the Anglo-Saxons may have adopted the practice from native Britons.Hutton 1991. p. 277. Indeed, barrows had been constructed for burial in Britain during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Romano-British periods prior to the Anglo-Saxon arrival. In many cases, Anglo-Saxons reused these earlier monuments rather than constructing their own. Barrow burials continued to be practiced by the Anglo-Saxons throughout the seventh century, but had effectively died out by the eighth. =Ship burials= Model of the ship burial at Mound One, Sutton Hoo. Another form of burial was that of ship burials, which were practiced by many of the Germanic peoples across northern Europe. In many cases it seems that the corpse was placed within a ship that was then either sent out to sea or left on land, but in both cases then set alight. In Suffolk however, ships were not burned, but buried, as is the case at Sutton Hoo, which it is believed, was the resting place of the king of the East Angles, Raedwald. Both ship and tumulus burials were described in the Beowulf poem, through the funerals of Scyld Scefing and Beowulf respectively. Grave goods Both pagan and Christian Anglo-Saxons buried their dead with grave goods. Amongst the earlier Anglo-Saxons who adhered to pagan beliefs, such goods accompanied both inhumed and cremated remains. In some cases, animal skulls, particularly oxen but also pig, were buried in human graves, a practice also found in Roman Britain. Howard WIlliams argued that grave goods carried mnemonic significance in Early Medieval society.Williams has also explored the significance of death, cremation and grooming implements. Grave goods can inform archaeologists about cultural connections and trade; for instance, at Buckland cemetery near Dover, Kent, over half of the brooches buried as grave goods were imports from continental Europe, illustrating the connections between the Kingdom of Kent and the Frankish area. Middle Anglo-Saxon period The Middle Anglo-Saxon period is a term applied to the years between circa 600 and 800 CE. The burial practices of this period have been described as being less well understood than those of either the Early or Late Anglo-Saxon period. The first individual to recognise a cemetery as having dated from this period was the late 18th century antiquarian James Douglas; in examining the grave goods found in Kentish barrow cemeteries, he noted the presence of Christian motifs on certain artefacts, thereby concluding that this cemetery contained the burials of those Anglo-Saxons who had converted to Christianity but who lived before the emergence of widespread churchyard burial. Further Middle Anglo- Saxon cemeteries were identified by the archaeologist T. C. Lethbridge in Cambridgeshire during the 1920s and 1930s, who noted that they lacked the 'pagan' elements, such as weapon burials, which were associated with earlier cemeteries; he thus assumed that those inhumed at the site were early Anglo- Saxon Christians. The archaeologist Helen Geake noted that the burials of this period could be analytically divided into four groups: furnished, unfurnished, princely, and deviant. Some cemeteries contain only one form of burial, but others combine different forms; the prominent Middle Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk for instance contained three types of burial. The documented conversion of Anglo-Saxon England to Christianity, which took place during the seventh century, was used by earlier archaeologists to explain many of the changes in burial practices during this period. For instance, the gradual decline in the appearance of grave goods and the increasing use of inhumed bodies located in a west-to-east orientation have been attributed to Christian beliefs about the afterlife. =Final Phase burials= Cemeteries of this period have sometimes been referred to as \\"Final Phase\\", a term coined for them by the archaeologist Edward Thurlow Leeds in 1936. He viewed such cemeteries as the last manifestation of the pagan way of life, before it was supplanted by Christianity with its unfurnished burial practices. In 1963, the archaeologist Miranda Hyslop analysed the excavated burials up to that date, and assembled a list of attributes which she believed defined Final Phase burials. The furnished burials of the \\"Final Phase\\" are typical of 7th and early-8th century cemeteries. However, the manner in which archaeologists have assigned burials as \\"Final Phase\\" has been uneven, and thus there is no clear corpus of agreed upon examples. Boddington summarised the characteristics of Final Phase burials as a series of eight points. First, it involved a new set of cemeteries being established under the influence of Christianity. Second, these cemeteries were often located close to settlements, in contrast to their Early Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Third, the burials are almost entirely inhumations, with very few cremation burials having been found from this period. Fourth, these inhumations tend to be oriented on a west-to-east direction. Fifth, some of the graves are located in, or under, barrows. Sixth, there is a high proportion of graves with few or no grave goods. Seventh, those items that are featured are predominantly relating to utilitarian clothing or represent small personal tokens. The final point is that some of the grave goods, notable the cross forms, have Christian symbolic significance. Replica of the \\"Saxon Princess\\" bed burial at the Street House Anglo-Saxon cemetery In addition, Geake noted that the bodies are generally supine, being either extended or slightly flexed, while the arms are typically at the sides of the body or folded across it. There is nevertheless variation in the use of structures within and around the graves, which include beds or chambers inside the grave, as well as mounds, postholes or boat parts outside of it. Burials reflecting this Final Phase exhibit an increasing polarity of grave wealth. While most Final Phase burials contain grave goods, there are fewer artefacts interned with the graves than was seen in the Early Anglo- Saxon period. The artefacts included as grave goods also differ from those typically found in earlier centuries. Brooches and long strings of beads become less common in female graves, while weapons become less common in male graves. Men's graves often include small buckles, knives, and sometimes shoelace tags. Women's graves typically consist of pins, chatelaines with such accessories as purse-mounts and workboxes, and necklaces containing small, monochrome beads, gold pendants, and slip-rings made of silver or bronze. The decline in grave goods has sometimes been attributed to suppression of this practice by the ecclesiastical Christian authorities. However this explanation has often been challenged, in part because there are no surviving canons or laws from this period that condemn the practice of burying the dead with grave goods; rather, contemporary ecclesiastical documents display little interest in how the dead are buried. Moreover, there is no clear termination of the use of grave goods but rather a gradual decline in the practice, whereas any ecclesiastical prohibition might have been expected to result in an immediate end to the practice. An alternative explanation for the decline in grave goods is that the Middle Anglo-Saxon period could have witnessed a change in the structure of inheritance; for instance, whereas weapons were previously inhumed along with their owner, there could have been an increasing emphasis on such items being inherited by the deceased's kin. A third explanation could be found in a growing desire to conserve limited resources and keep them within circulation, rather than removing them from social usage through burial with the dead. This could in turn be linked to the expansion of trade systems and the establishment of trading sites such as Ipswich at which items could be more easily exchanged. The spatial patterning of grave good types also differs from those of the Early Anglo-Saxon period, as smaller regional distributions were replaced by larger ones. This might reflect that the people of Anglo- Saxon England were beginning to increasingly recognise themselves as members of a larger cultural group, the English, as opposed to their earlier more geographically restricted cultural groupings. =Princely burials= The Taplow burial mound, an example of a highly furnished \\"Final Phase\\" burial A different form of burial found in Middle Anglo-Saxon England is termed the \\"Rich Burial\\" or \\"Princely Burial\\" by archaeologists. These are characterised by having a large number and high quality of their grave goods, and are often also found beneath a barrow mound or tumulus. However, there is no precise agreed upon definition among Anglo-Saxonist archaeologists regarding the criteria for characterising a burial as a princely burial or not. In various respects - such as the orientation and position of the inhumed body and the variety of structures within or around the grave - these princely burials are similar to the wider array of contemporary Final Phase furnished burials. =Unfurnished burials= A number of cemeteries dating from the seventh and eighth centuries which contain a majority of unfurnished burials. The bodies within these inhumations are often laid out supine in a roughly east to west alignment. Such burials have been found in both rural contexts, as at Burrow Hill, Burgh Castle, and Nazeing, as well as in urban contexts such as Staple Green, Winchester and Castle Green, Hereford. The practice of unfurnished burial might have been adopted from other areas of the British Isles who already had such traditions in place, such as Ireland or Northumbria. =Deviant burials and execution cemeteries= These burials typically have either very few or no grave goods. In some instances, for instance at Sutton Hoo and Cuddeston, these burials have been made around a barrow. Late Anglo- Saxon period In nearby Francia, Charlemagne's ordinances of parish rights - issued in 786 and 810/3 - prohibited the continuing use of earlier, non- Christian cemeteries, emphasising the need for churchyard burial. This formal ruling may have confirmed attitudes that were already held by the Anglo-Saxon Church. The archaeologist Andy Boddington stated that the transition from the highly furnished graves of the Early Anglo-Saxon period to their unfurnished counterparts on the Late Anglo-Saxon period represented \\"one of the most dramatic archaeological statements\\" of the early medieval. After 900, a churchyard consecration rite was developed. The burial of an individual in the parish to which they belonged was considered mandatory. The only individuals excluded from burial in the churchyard were unrepentant perjurers and those who had committed suicide yet were not deemed mad. The enclosure of churchyards was a development of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Clergy increasingly developed a financial interest in having individuals buried within their churchyard, because they would receive a fee for both the burial and masses to be performed for the dead. Christian teaching held as a basic tenet the belief that after bodily death the human soul would be judged according to their behaviour in life. Those who had been baptised, kept faith, performed good deeds, and had intercessory prayer could be permitted to Heaven, while those who did not do such things would go on an afterlife of torment in Hell. Texts from this period reflect that there was a division of opinion about the clergy as to whether judgement followed immediately on from death or whether all deceased soul awaited Judgement Day before being sent to either Heaven or Hell. The concept of Purgatory, an intermediate zone between Heaven and Hell, had yet to be developed. By the eighth century, burial in clothing had largely disappeared, with the exception of clerics. Instead, the majority were buried in a white shroud that was wrapped around the body, in this manner emulating the description of the burial of Jesus Christ in the Gospels. The use of coffins was practical when a body had to be transported some distance prior to its burial. Typically made of wood, in a number of excavated cases - for instance at York Minster - they also included metal fittings and locks. These wooden coffins rarely survive in the archaeological record, however a number of examples were preserved due to waterlogged conditions at Barton on Humber. In a minority of cases, coffins were made not of wood but of lead or stone, the latter being used in particular for important clerics. =Graveyards= The orderly burial of inhumations oriented in a west to east direction with no intercutting was the normal pattern for graveyard burial. =Grave markers= A tradition emerged of marking important graves, particularly ecclesiastical ones. Such markers included slabs that laid flat over the grave, and large crosses that stood upright, a number of which still survive in place. Surviving marker stones have shown that a number of regional styles existed. In Eastern England, a Scandinavian artistic influence is apparent on many of them. In the areas of Scandinavian settlement in the northeast of England, hogback tombs were created. Scandinavian settlement also resulted in the return of furnished burials under barrows in several instances, for instance at Ingleby in Derbyshire. =Saints' burials= Bede offers a description of the burial of St Cuthbert. This account has been described as being \\"an extreme case\\" but not \\"untypical of those considered sanctified\\". Discovery and excavation =Antiquarian investigation= The earliest record of post-Anglo-Saxon people excavating an early Anglo-Saxon burial comes from the 12th century, when Roger of Wendover described how several monks dug up the burial mounds at Redbourne, Hertfordshire, in search of the bones of Saint Amphibalus, a Roman period priest. A later documented case occurred in the 17th century, when Sir Thomas Browne published a pamphlet entitled Hydrotaphia, Urn Buriall (1658), in which he described a number of cremation urns found in Norfolk; although they had been Anglo-Saxon in origin, he mistook them for being Romano-British. Describing these finds, Browne related that \\"In a Field of old Walsingham not many months past were digged up between forty and fifty urns, deposited in a dry and sandy soil, not a yard deep, not far from one another... some containing two pounds of bones, distinguishable in skulls, ribs, jaws, thigh- bones, and teeth, with fresh impressions of their combustion\\". Despite these earlier excavations, archaeologist Sam Lucy remarked that \\"the accolade of being the first excavators of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries should really go to two Kentish gentlemen clerics.\\" The first was the antiquarian Reverend Bryan Faussett. Between 1759 and 1773 he excavated at a number of cemeteries in Kent; Gilton, Kingstone Down, Chartham Down and Sibertswold. Uncovering about 750 graves, he made detailed records in his field notebooks noting anatomical details, but like Browne before him, he mistakenly attributed them to Roman- Britain. Following his death in 1776, Faussett's notes were written up and published in 1856 as the Inventorium Sepulchrale by Charles Roach Smith, who added his own commentary to the work. The second of these antiquarian Kentish clerics was James Douglas, who excavated at such sites as Chatham Lines and Greenwich Park from 1779 to 1793. He published his findings in a book entitled Nenia Britannica (1793). Douglas was the first to identify burials of this type as being Anglo-Saxon rather than Romano-British, coming to this conclusion because of \\"Their situation near villages of [Anglo-]Saxon names\\" and the fact that \\"They are scattered all over Britain in places which the [Anglo-]Saxons occupied, and are not discovered in the parts of Wales which they had not subdued.\\" =Archaeological investigation= Although some antiquarians had made attempts to excavate and catalogue the Anglo-Saxon grave-sites, on the whole, such sites were commonly damaged and destroyed in eighteenth and early nineteenth century England, with little attempt being made to properly study them. Due to the Society of Antiquaries' inability to act on the situation, in 1843 Charles Roach Smith and Thomas Wright - both keen Anglo-Saxonists - founded the British Archaeological Association (BAA), which held its first conference the following year in Canterbury. The BAA's leadership campaigned for better rights for native British archaeology, asking for it to be protected legally and to be recognised by major institutions. When the British Museum refused to purchase Faussett's collection of Anglo- Saxon artefacts following his grandson's death in 1853, Roach Smith complained that \\"not only does the Government begin with gathering the monuments, ancient and modern, of all foreign countries, but it ends there also. Our national antiquities are not even made subservient and placed in the lowest grade; they are altogether unrecognised and ignored.\\"Roach Smith, in Faussett 1856. p. x.

Knegt speculated on films that might be nominated for the Oscars. Films he deemed \\"most likely to succeed\\" at being nominated included: Like Crazy for Best Picture, Michael Shannon of Take Shelter for Best Actor, Elizabeth Olsen of Martha Marcy May Marlene for Best Actress, Felicity Jones of Like Crazy for Best Actress, Jessica Chastain of Take Shelter for Best Supporting Actress, Project Nim for Best Documentary Feature, Page One for Best Documentary Feature, and The Interrupters for Best Documentary Feature. He wrote \\"It's reasonable to feel assured that at least one of Sundance's docs will end up an Oscar nominee, if not two, three or four.\\" Jada Yuan of New York magazine wrote \\"perhaps the biggest highlight of the festival is just how ripe it's been for acquisitions, with nearly 30 films getting picked up, the most at any Sundance ever.\\" On \\"why everyone is suddenly so bullish on independent film\\", Owen Gleiberman wrote that the \\"energy and optimism at Sundance this year wasn't just hype.\\" He said the factors he thought were driving a new evolving vision of the indie film world included: \\"The deals haven‚Äôt gotten cheaper ‚Äî they've gotten smarter\\", a belief that last year's new festival director John Cooper and director of programming Trevor Groth \\"have re-energized the festival, heightening its quality and organizing the movies with a tempting new shape and vision\\", video on demand gives distributors a safety net and more confidence, and the audiences for Sundance movies are not going away, saying \\"The Oscars...have become a testament to the central place that Sundance movies now occupy.\\" Acquisitions Redford was happy about the success of the festival, with about 45 films being sold vs 14 in 2010, an increase of about 220%. Redford said studios are realizing \\"there are audiences\\" for indie films. Regarding the number of dramas acquired by distributors, Kenneth Turan said \\"That number seems way out of proportion to the quality of the films, or to how well they will likely do in the marketplace.\\" Turan wrote \\"In documentaries, the situation was reversed: The quality was sky high, but hardly any were acquired for theatrical release\\" because audiences are \\"reluctant to embrace the genre.\\" At the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, 9 films went on to garner 15 Oscar nominations. Tom Hall of indieWire wrote \\"Following one of the most critically successful years in the festival's history, a year that saw Blue Valentine, Winter‚Äôs Bone, The Kids Are Alright, I Am Love, Animal Kingdom, Enter The Void, Please Give, A Film Unfinished, Gasland, Restrepo, Exit Through The Gift Shop, Waste Land, Last Train Home, The Oath, The Tillman Story and many others find tremendous acclaim, 2011 always had its work cut out for it\\", saying \\"after looking at a strong year at the indie box office for last year's films, reasonable, level-headed deals were popping up all over Sundance.\\". But Hall wrote that this year he felt that \\"the recession came home to roost.\\" He said \\"If 2011 marks the line in the sand for independent film financing in a recession driven investment climate, it also marked the complete opposite in the distribution world; a return to the glory days of pure, unadulterated content speculation.\\" Hall wondered about the pressure on this year's acquired films to \\"perform across multiple platforms\\" in the next year. He wrote \\"if this year‚Äôs buying spree proves anything, it at once cements the dominance of the Sundance Film Festival as the premiere market festival in the US and, given many of the films that sold, raises my eyebrows.\\" Acquisitions at the festival included: *Anchor Bay Entertainment **The Big Bang *Dada Films **The Last Mountain *Focus Features **Pariah *Fox Searchlight Pictures **Another Earth **Sound of My Voice **Bengali Detective (remake rights) **The Art of Getting By (Homework) **Martha Marcy May Marlene *HBO **Knuckle (remake rights) *IFC **Buck (through Sundance Selects) **The Ledge **Perfect Sense **These Amazing Shadows **Salvation Boulevard (with SPWA) *Liddell Entertainment **Silent House *Lionsgate **Devil's Double *Magnolia Pictures **I Melt With You **Page One (with Participant Media) *Maya Entertainment **All She Can (Benavides Born) *Motion Film Group **Gun Hill Road *National Geographic Channel **Life in a Day *Oscilloscope **Bellflower *Paramount **Like Crazy *Participant Media **Circumstance *Roadside Attractions **Margin Call (with Lionsgate) **Project Nim (Lionsgate has DVD rights, HBO has overall rights) **The Future *Sony Pictures Classics **The Guard **Pom Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold **Take Shelter *The Weinstein Company **The Details **My Idiot Brother References External links *Festival webpage *27th Sundance Film Festival at IMDb 2011 Category:2011 film festivals Category:2011 in Utah Category:2011 in American cinema Category:2011 festivals in the United States Category:January 2011 events in the United States ","title":"2011 Sundance Film Festival"},{"id":"30556207","text":"Christopher Ray Johnson (born January 17, 1960 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American computer scientist.

Parazit was launched before the June 2009 presidential elections in Iran. It became very popular in Iran, reaching its audience via illegal satellite dishes, the internet, or bootleg DVDs. Its name is a reference to the Iranian government's repeated attempts to jam foreign satellite programming. Because it was distributed through unofficial channels, it is impossible to determine the audience. However, as of January 2011, the show's YouTube channel was viewed 45,000 times a week, while their Facebook page was visited 17 million times a month.

This TV series airs on Mondays to Thursdays at 20:25. Starring by Sinjai Plengpanich Synopsis Sinjai Plengpanich takes on the role of Panrawi, a woman trying to maintain her station in life. She is married to the wealthy Rangsi Soriyathit played by Pisan Akarasene (Aom‚Äôs biological father in real life and in this lakorn). Rangsi and Panrawi have no biological children together, they do have one adopted son Passakorn Nat Devahastin na Ayudhaya. Rangsi does have one biological child with another woman, Rangrong played by Aom Piyada. Rangsi did not know of her existence until she was grown. Rangrong is a feisty young woman out for revenge on Panrawi the woman who harmed her mother and to claim what‚Äôs hers, which is Rangsi‚Äôs inheritance. Rangrong ended up not really being the biological daughter of Rangsi. What happened in the parents' younger years, Panrawi did not want anyone to take Rangsi away from her because she really loved him. Rangsi fell for this women that played a traditional Thai musical instrument at an occasion he attended. Rangsi ends up getting her pregnant. Rangsi and Panrawi got married but this other woman was still in the picture making Panrawi mad. Panrawi takes this woman to an abortion center. Every viewer is supposed to think that this woman refused to get an abortion and the child ended up being Rangrong. That is wrong. The other woman really had an abortion. She (which is really played by Fang to make it easier to understand later on) used her talent to play near the temples when one day another woman shows with her young newborn. Fang snatches that child, which is really Rangrong. So, The lakorn goes on with Rangrong being the victim until DNA proves that she is really not a member of Rangsi's family. So, Rangrong turns into the n'rai in the lakorn, which made it a really out-of-the-ordinary lakorn. Rangrong makes a fake will forcing Rangsi to sign everything to her. After he signs, she then kills him. Panrawi does all that she can to take care of Rangrong but they were just equally tough. The bad that Panrawi had done in her past came back to her and now she is faced with Rangrong, who was taught by Fang to get revenge for her and to take over everything that really belongs to them. Rangrong had a hard time believing it too that she was not Fang's child but still went on with her evil life since she had nothing to lose anymore. Rangrong's real mother ended up crazy the day her newborn was snatched from her. So, Panrawi came in the contact with this woman by accident and does all that she can to determine if Rangrong was hers. Panrawi almost succeeds until Rangrong killed her own mother by dropping her in the water. Rangrong does all this horrible things making Panrawi become the victim. In the end, Rangrong commits suicide to wash away the sins she created after she was caught. Panrawi ends the lakorn by making a statement about doing good and good will come but if you do bad then bad will come.

Bounded on the north east by the border with Somerset, it is the second largest parish in Devon, covering about 15,000 acres. Until the 18th century the village was an important centre of the woollen industry, and mining was also a significant employer in the parish until the 19th century. North Molton viewed from the southwest with Exmoor in the far distance History North Molton was a manor within the royal demesne until it was granted to a member of the la Zouche family by King John. In 1270 Roger la Zouche was granted a licence to hold a weekly market in the manor and an annual fair on All Saints' Day.White's Directory, 1850 The manor then passed through the St Maur family to the Bampfylde family, in the 15th century.Burke's General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage, 1833, Baron Poltimore, pp.303-307 Amyas Bampfylde (died 1626) built Court Hall‚Äînow demolished‚Äîto the immediate east of the church.Layley, Charles G, All Saints, North Molton, A Short History (revised by Jonathan Edmunds), church booklet, p.7 Court House viewed from the south west.

Mining In the 16th century there were mines in the region of Heasley Mill. Later workings were near North Radworthy, where in the early 19th century copper was worked and some gold was found, though not in sufficient quantities for commercial extraction. By the later 19th century, Bampfylde Mine on the River Mole was producing iron, copper and manganese before it closed in 1877; and Florence Mine, a mile to the east, was being worked for iron, copper and lead until 1885‚Äîfrom 1874 this mine had a tramway running the four miles to South Molton railway station.

The species was first described by Friedrich August Rudolph Kolenati in 1846. Description Eurydema ventralis has a length of about . It typically has a two-tone coloration, yellow or red with black markings. The body is flattened, the head is rounded and the cheeks are sinuous with narrow edges. When the adults come out from the last instar they are white or ivory with black spots. They slowly reach the final red coloration, at first becoming yellow, then orange and finally red. The specimens completely white and black are immature. This species can damage the cultivations of crucifers (family Brassicaceae) and sometimes also of potatoes and cereals. Life cycle Mating pair Adults overwinter, reappear in spring and attack the cabbages. In the first half of April mating begins, followed by the laying of eggs. At mid-May the nymphs hatch, reaching the maturity in June. In summer, females lay the eggs of the second generation, this time both on crucifers and on other plants (rose, alfalfa). In July the eggs hatch and the larvae become mature in August. Adults of the second generation return on crucifers and remain there until September. At the first cold days of the autumn the adults take refuge in winter shelters. Distribution This species can be found in most of Europe.

Lombardi played running back for the Arizona State University Sun Devils from 1980 through 1983, and was awarded a varsity letter for all four years of play. Lombardi went undrafted in the 1984 NFL Draft and signed as a free agent with the Chicago Bears. However, he did not make the team's roster. Coaching career =Assistant coaching= After spending the 1985 season as defensive coordinator for his alma mater, Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois, Lombardi served as defensive backs coach for the Wisconsin Badgers while earning a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. From 1989 through 1996 he was the defensive coordinator for the NCAA Division II Mankato State Mavericks (now Minnesota State University). In 1997, then-head coach Rick Rasnick hired him as the linebackers coach for the Eastern Michigan Eagles, and in the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he served as the team's defensive coordinator. =Eastern Michigan= The first ten games of the 1999 season were coached by Rick Rasnick, with Lombardi serving as defensive coordinator. Eastern Michigan athletic director Dave Diles Jr. fired Rasnick on November 16, and named Lombardi as the interim head coach, to serve for the final game of the season. Under Rasnick, the 1999 team had compiled a record of 4 wins and 6 losses. Lombardi's one game as EMU's head coach was a 24-30 loss to the Northern Illinois on November 20, 1999 that was played in DeKalb, Illinois. With the loss on the last game of the year under Lombardi, the team concluded its season with a record of 4-7\\\\. Lombardi is the only EMU head football coach to serve for just a single game, and as a result, his five days served is the shortest tenure of any head coach in the history of Eastern Michigan football. Jeff Woodruff hired Lombardi to coach the running backs and coordinate the special teams for the 2000 season. Following the 2001 season Lombardi departed for the upstart professional football league the XFL. =High school= At the end of Eastern Michigan's 1999 season, none of Rasnick's assistant coaches were retained. In 2001, Lombardi was the defensive coordinator for the short-lived Chicago Enforcers of the XFL. When the XFL folded after one year, Lombardi decided to stay close to home coaching high school football in order to spend more time with his four-year-old son Rocky, saying, \\"Football has been so great, providing me with everything I've had in life. There's no way I was going to let Rocky grow up hating football because his dad is always gone.\\" In 2002, Lombardi became the head coach at Homewood- Flossmoor High School in Homewood, Illinois, where his father had been coach in the late 1960s, and he quickly revitalized the struggling team. However, after just one season, Lombardi left Homewood-Flossmoor moving closer to his family who lived in Plainfield, taking over at Hinsdale Central High School in Hinsdale, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago. After three seasons at Hinsdale Central, in which the team posted a 30‚Äì7 record, two trips to the Class 8A quarterfinals and one trip to the semifinals, Lombardi had taken the Red Devils to the best three year record in school history. However, in iIllinois you are not a tenured faculty member until your fourth year of employment so Lombardi was asked to resign his post as there was no need to show cause by state law. Lombardi among great community support chose to stay and fight for his job, the community came out in large numbers with 5,000 signatures on a petition and months of supportive testimonials at every school board meeting in the end he was not retained. His lawsuit against the school district for breach of contract was settled for $10,000, and the following year the entire administrative team was fired. Lombardi moved on to Cedar Rapids Washington High School there he took on the responsibility of Head Strength and Conditioning coach, Head Football Assistant Track and was later the Head Baseball Coach. Lombardi made an immediate impact returning the Warriors to the playoffs in 2006. Over the next 7 years the Warriors were either in the quarterfinals or the semi-finals of the state championships all but one season. The track team won two state championships and never finished lower than 5th place. In addition to that Lombardi sent over 100 athletes on to play at the collegiate level. He built a youth program that won a National Championship and was voted the top middle school team in the nation by several youth websites in addition to that his work with youth athletics produced Nationally ranked Football, Wrestling and Baseball teams. In his free time Tony enjoys writing autobiographies on multiple web sites, including Wikipedia. In 2013 following the baseball season Lombardi resigned as Head Football and Baseball Coach and moved to West Des Moines to go into Medical Sales, following an out-of-court settlement with the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners resulting in temporary suspension of his teaching license and coaching certificate.http://metrosportsreport.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=16565&catid;=184 The youth football teams that Lombardi coached have yet to lose a lower level game at Cedar Rapids Washington. Lombardi is currently coaching at West Des Moines Valley High School where his family resides and His son is currently the starting Quarterback at Valley and is a highly recruited Division I prospect.

The idea is that humans possess innate knowledge (perhaps acquired before birth) and that learning consists of rediscovering that knowledge from within. Meno In Meno, Plato's character (and old teacher) Socrates is challenged by Meno with what has become known as the sophistic paradox, or the paradox of knowledge: :Meno: And how are you going to search for [the nature of virtue] when you don't know at all what it is, Socrates? Which of all the things you don't know will you set up as target for your search? And even if you actually come across it, how will you know that it is that thing which you don't know?Meno 80d In other words, one who knows none of the attributes, properties, and/or other descriptive markers of any kind that help signify what something is (physical or otherwise) will not recognize it even after coming across it. Therefore, if the converse is true, and one knows the attributes, properties and/or other descriptive markers of this thing, one should not need to seek it out at all. The conclusion is that in either instance, there is no point trying to gain that \\"something\\"; in the case of Plato's aforementioned work, there is no point in seeking knowledge. Socrates' response is to develop his theory of anamnesis and to suggest that the soul is immortal, and repeatedly incarnated; knowledge is in the soul from eternity (86b), but each time the soul is incarnated its knowledge is forgotten in the trauma of birth. What one perceives to be learning, then, is the recovery of what one has forgotten. (Once it has been brought back it is true belief, to be turned into genuine knowledge by understanding.) Socrates (and Plato) thus sees himself not as a teacher but as a midwife, aiding with the birth of knowledge that was already there in the student. The theory is illustrated by Socrates asking a slave boy questions about geometry. At first, the boy gives the wrong answer; when that is pointed out to him, he is puzzled, but by asking questions, Socrates helps him to reach the correct answer. That is intended to show that since the boy was not told the answer, he reached the truth by only recollecting what he had once known but later forgotten. Phaedo In Phaedo, Plato develops his theory of anamnesis, in part by combining it with his theory of Forms. Firstly, he elaborates how anamnesis can be achieved: whereas in Meno, nothing more than Socrates' method of questioning is offered, in Phaedo, Plato presents a way of living that would enable one to overcome the misleading nature of the body through katharsis (Greek: Œ∫Œ¨Œ∏Œ±œÅœÉŒπœÇ; ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù (from guilt or defilement), ‚Äúpurification‚Äù). The body and its senses are the source of error; knowledge cannot be regained except through the use of reason, contemplating things with the soul (noesis) (see 66 b‚Äìd). Secondly, Plato clarifies that genuine knowledge, as opposed to mere true belief (doxa), is distinguished by its content. One can know only eternal truths since they are the only truths that possibly were in the soul from eternity. It may be very useful to have a true belief about, say, the best way to get from London to Oxford, such a belief does not qualify as knowledge; how could the human soul know such factually contingent propositions for all eternity? Neoplatonism For later interpreters of Plato, the concept of anamnesis became less epistemic and more ontological. Plotinus himself did not posit recollection in the strict sense of the term because all knowledge of universally important ideas (logos) came from a source outside of time (Dyad or the divine nous) and was accessible, by means of contemplation, to the soul as part of noesis. They were more objects of experience, of inner knowledge or insight, than of recollection. However, in Neoplatonism, the theory of anamnesis became part of the mythology of the descent of the soul. Porphyry's short work De Antro Nympharum (ostensibly a commentary on the brief passage in Odyssey 13) elucidated that notion, as did Macrobius's much longer Commentary on the Dream of Scipio. The idea of psychic memory was used by Neoplatonists to demonstrate the celestial and immaterial origins of the soul, and to explain how memories of the world-soul could be recalled by everyday human beings. As such, psychic recollection was intrinsically connected to the Platonic conception of the soul itself. Since the contents of individual \\"material\\" or physical memories were trivial, only the universal recollection of Forms, or divine objects, drew one closer to the immortal source of being. Anamnesis is the closest that human minds can come to experiencing the freedom of the soul before it is encumbered by matter. The process of incarnation is described in Neoplatonism as a trauma that causes the soul to forget its experiences (and often its divine origins as well). The storyteller's voice is concealed by John and Plato in order to pursue their anamnetic efforts and to encourage the following generations to be not only readers but also partakers in their original discussions on the soul. Gratitude, as an example of divine salvation, was expressed by offering to God the first fruits of the harvest which maintains an identity with those who performed these actions in the past and therefore actualising them in the present.

The 9 city councils of Milan (municipal website) In the \\"sunburst\\" geometry of the zones of Milan, Zone 2 is the slice that connects the centre to the periphery in the north-east direction. Overview The history and development of Zone 2 have been largely influenced by its location on important routes leading from Milan to major nearby settlements such as Monza as well as towards Venice and other main cities of the Italian North-East. The Naviglio Martesana canal, which traverses most of Zone 2, has been a prominent transportation means in the development of the Milanese area; between the 19th and 20th century, this role has been taken on by the railway system, which again was largely based in what is now Zone 2. The Milano Centrale railway station, the most important railway station in Milan and one of the most important railway nodes in Italy, is located in the eponymous district of Zone 2. Especially as a consequence of the development of the railway system, in the early 20th century the Milanese north-east quickly changed from a rural area to a mostly industrial city outskirt, experiencing, at the same time, a dramatic increase in population. In the mid-20th century, as factories were gradually dismantled as a consequence of the expansion of the city centre, Zone 2 changed again, this time into a mostly residential and tertiary area. The recent evolution of Zone 2 is also strongly influenced by the high concentration of extra-European immigrants, the highest in Milan, which has led to the development of distinctively multi-ethnic neighbourhoods such as that of Viale Padova (in the Loreto district). The complex history of Zone 2 is witnessed by its diverse landscape, which includes such contrasting elements as modern skyscraper- punctuated districts, old-fashioned popular Milanese neighbourhoods, luxury villas on the banks of the Naviglio Martesana, restored \\"cascine\\" (country houses), abandoned factories, and modern high-income residential areas. Subdivision The main quartieri (districts) of Zone 2 are Adriano, Crescenzago, Gorla, Greco, Loreto, Maggiolina (also known as Villaggio dei Giornalisti), Mandello, Mirabello, Ponte Seveso, Porta Nuova, Precotto, Stazione Centrale, and Turro. Many of these districts were independent comuni up until the first decades of the 20th century, before being annexed to Milan. This is reflected, amongst other things, in the fact that many of them are evidently structured as small towns rather than as typical metropolitan areas.
