It is commonly found in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. It is commonly described as \\"packed rice\\", although there are other types of similar packed rice such as lontong and bakchang. Ketupat is cut open and its skin (woven palm leaf) removed. The inner rice cake is cut in pieces and served as a staple food in place of plain steamed rice. It is usually eaten with rendang, opor ayam, sayur labu (chayote soup), or sambal goreng hati (liver in sambal), or served as an accompaniment to satay (chicken or beef or lamb in skewers) or gado-gado (mixed vegetables with peanut sauce). Ketupat is also the main element of certain dishes such as ketupat sayur (ketupat in chayote soup with tofu and boiled egg) and kupat tahu (ketupat and tofu in peanut sauce). Ketupat is related to similar dishes in other rice-farming Austronesian cultures, like the Filipino puso, although the latter is not restricted to diamond shapes and traditionally come in various intricately woven designs ranging from star-like to animal-shaped. An octahedron-shaped version called katupat was also found in pre-colonial Guam and the Mariana Islands, before the ancient rice cultivation in the island was replaced by corn brought by the Spanish. History People weaving young palm fronds (Indonesian: janur) into ketupat pouch to be sold prior of lebaran in Jakarta. The use of woven young palm leaves (janur) fronds as a pouch to cook food is widespread in Maritime Southeast Asia, from Indonesia and Malaysia, to the Philippines. Ketupat is made from rice that has been wrapped in a woven palm leaf pouch and boiled. As the rice cooks, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the ketupat its characteristic form and texture of a rice dumpling. Local stories passed down through the generations have attributed the creation of this style of rice preparation to the seafarers' need to keep cooked rice from spoiling during long sea voyages. The coco leaves used in wrapping the rice are always shaped into a triangular or diamond form and stored hanging in bunches in the open air. The shape of the package facilitates moisture to drip away from the cooked rice while the coco leaves allow the rice to be aerated and at the same time prevent flies and insects from touching it. Despite its current association with Muslim festival of lebaran, ketupat is also known in non-Muslim communities, such as Hindu Balinese and people of the Philippines, which suggested that the weaving of coconut fronds has pre-Islamic origin. It was linked to the local Hindu ritual on venerating Dewi Sri, the Javanese goddess of rice. The Balinese Hindus still weaved the Cili fronds effigy of Dewi Sri as an offering, as well as weaving tipat fronds during Kuningan Balinese Hindu holy day. In Java and most of Indonesia, ketupat is linked to Islamic tradition of lebaran (Eid ul- Fitr). The earliest connection of ketupat with Islamic lebaran tradition is believed to be originated in 15th-century Sultanate of Demak. In Indonesian markets, empty pouch of ketupat skin made from woven janur are often sold prior of Lebaran. According to Javanese traditions, the Indonesian lebaran tradition was first started when Sunan Bonang, one of Wali Songo of Tuban in 15th-century Java, calls for the Muslims to elevate the perfection of their Ramadhan fast by asking forgiveness and forgiving others' wrongdoings.Mahfud MD: \\"Sejarah Lebaran\\" The tradition on preparing and consuming ketupat or kupat in Javanese language during lebaran is believed to be introduced by Raden Mas Sahid or Sunan Kalijaga, one of Wali Songo (nine Muslim saints) that spread Islam in Java. Sunan Kalijaga introduced the lebaran ketupat ritual on 8 Shawwal, a week after Eid ul-Fitr and a day after a six-day Shawwal fast. It is believed that it contains appropriate symbolism; kupat means ngaku lepat or \\"admitting one's mistakes\\" in Javanese language, in accordance to asking for forgiveness tradition during lebaran. The crossed weaving of palm leaves symbolises mistakes and sins committed by human beings, and the inner whitish rice cake symbolise purity and deliverance from sins after observing Ramadhan fast, prayer and rituals. Other than Java, the tradition on consuming ketupat during Eid ul-Fitr is also can be found throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and also neighboring countries, including Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Cultural significance Boiled ketupat In various places in Indonesia, there is a ceremony called Lebaran Ketupat, which is observed after the conclusion of an extra six days of fasting following Idul Fitri. In Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, thousands of Muslims celebrated Lebaran Ketupat‚Äîor Lebaran Topat as it is locally called‚Äîby visiting the graves of Muslim ulamas before partaking in communal ceremonial activities, which includes music performances, ketupat cooking competitions, to shared meals where ketupat was served as the main dish. Side dishes at the events varied, ranging from plecing kangkung (stir-fried water spinach) to the local dish of Ayam Taliwang. Ketupat as centerpiece of Lebaran feast, served with sayur lodeh, opor ayam, rendang, sambal goreng ati and emping In Central Java, Lebaran Ketupat is called Bada Kupat, and was celebrated by cooking and serving ketupat and lepet (steamed sticky rice cooked in plaited palm leaves) in Semarang. In Colo, Kudus Regency, a parade of gunungan (cone-shape offering) made of ketupat, lepet and other food items on the slope of Mount Muria near the grave of noted Muslim preacher Sunan Muria, was held to celebrate Bada Kupat, while on the slope of Mount Merapi in Boyolali Regency,the celebration featured a parade of livestock decorated with ketupat. Among Hindu communities in Bali and Banyuwangi in East Java, ketupat is part of the offering and ritual of Kuningan festive celebration to conclude the Galungan holy days. During Galungan, Hindu families create and erect a penjor pole made of janur (young palm leaves), and then make some offerings to the Pura. Ten days after Galungan, the ceremony of Kuningan is observed to conclude the religious holy days. To celebrate Kuningan, Balinese Hindu families make tipat or ketupat first as offering, and then they consume some ketupat afterwards. There are some striking similarities between Javanese Muslim Lebaran and Balinese Hindu Galungan-Kuningan holy days, of which ketupat is one. For example, the families pay a visit to the grave of their family or ancestors prior of observing the holy day, and they consume ketupat to conclude the religious festival. Although today in contemporary Indonesia, ketupat is strongly associated with Muslim celebration of Idul Fitri, this parallel phenomenon suggested the pre-Islamic native origin of ketupat, as Native Indonesian ways to shows gratitude and to celebrate festivities by making and consuming certain kind of food. Varieties Ketupat daun palas, a triangle version of the ketupat primarily found in Malay Peninsula. There are many varieties of ketupat, with two of the more common ones being ketupat nasi and ketupat pulut. Ketupat nasi is made from common white rice and is wrapped in a square shape with coconut palm leaves while ketupat pulut is made from glutinous rice is usually wrapped in a triangular shape using the leaves of the fan palm (Licuala). Ketupat pulut is also called ketupat daun palas in Malaysia, primarily found in northern Malay Peninsula and among the Malay community of southern Thailand. Usually ketupat pouch are made from janur or young palm leaves fronds. However, in Kalimantan, nipah leaves might be used and woven into ketupat as well. Ketupat is also traditionally served by Indonesian and Malays at open houses on festive occasions such as lebaran or Idul Fitri (Hari Raya Aidilfitri). During Idul Fitri in Indonesia, ketupat is often served with either opor ayam (chicken in coconut milk), chicken or beef curry, rendang, sambal goreng ati (spicy beef liver), krechek (buffalo or beef skin dish), or sayur labu Siam (chayote soup). Ketupat or lontong is also used as the replacement of plain steamed rice in gado-gado, karedok, or pecel. Derivative dishes Other than replacing steamed rice or lontong in certain dishes, such as satay, gado-gado, and ketoprak, ketupat is also forming the essential part of other derivative dishes with certain recipes developed from it. =Ketupat sayur= Ketupat sayur Betawi with ayam goreng. Katupek sayua randang limpo Minangkabau version with spleen rendang. One of popular street food in Indonesian cities is Ketupat sayur which literary means \\"ketupat in vegetables soup\\". Ketupat sayur is known in two popular versions; the Betawi version from Jakarta and katupek sayua the Padang version from West Sumatra. Ketupat sayur is popular as breakfast fare in Jakarta and Padang. It consist of ketupat served with sliced labu siam (chayote) and unripe jackfruit gulai in thin and spicy coconut milk soup, topped with cooked tofu and telur pindang (spiced boiled egg), and krupuk crackers. The Padang or Minangkabau version might be served with additional dishes, such as egg balado, rendang and various gulai. If lontong was used in the identical recipe, it is called lontong sayur instead. =Kupat tahu= Kupat tahu Gempol from Bandung. Ketupat also used as main ingredient in Sundanese and Javanese dish kupat tahu, which is ketupat, tahu goreng (fried tofu), and bean sprouts served in peanut sauce topped with crispy krupuk crackers. Popular variants of kupat tahu includes Kupat tahu Kuningan from Kuningan Regency in West Java, Kupat Tahu Magelang from Magelang Regency, Central Java, and Kupat tahu Gempol from Surabaya, East Java. Its Balinese version is called tipat cantok, which is sliced ketupat, vegetables, bean sprout, cucumber, and fried tofu mixed in peanut sauce which is made from ground fried peanuts, garlic, chili pepper, salt and tauco fermented soy paste. Other uses Gado-gado stall displaying the ingredients of the dish, including ketupat In Hindu-majority Bali, ketupat is used as one of the temple offerings. In Java, among traditional Muslim abangan community, the woven empty or uncooked ketupat skin is often hung as an amulet to symbolise wealth and prosperity. Because in Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Thailand, Singapore and Brunei ketupat is strongly linked to Islamic Eid ul-Fitr, it is also used there as decorations. The empty ketupat skin woven from colourful ribbons are used as decorations to signify this festive occasions, in the same fashions as bells to signify Christmas. Colorful ribbon ketupat are often used to decorate shopping malls, offices, or as decorations of gift parcels. Similar dishes Ketupat Raya, images of ketupat are often used as decoration to celebrate Hari Raya or Eid ul-Fitr. In the Philippines, similar rice pouches are known as puso (literally \\"heart\\") and had their origins from pre-colonial animistic ritual offerings as recorded by Spanish historians. Unlike ketupat, however, they are not restricted to diamond shapes and can come in a wide variety of weaving styles which still survive among various ethnic groups in the Philippines today. Ketupat are also woven differently, the leaf base and the loose leaf strands do not exit at the same point, as in most Filipino puso. Ketupat somewhat resemble the tamu pinad version among Muslim Filipinos the most, which are shaped like a flattened diamond, although they are also woven differently. Patupat, despite having the same form, is cooked differently. Patupat is cooked in sugarcane juice. In Cambodia, a similar dish of pounded sticky rice wrapped in a pentagonal woven palm leaves is called katom (·ûÄ·û∂·ûè·üÜ) in Khmer. It is a non-traditional variant of num kom which uses banana leaves instead of palm. In Indonesia, similar dish of compressed rice in leaf container includes lepet, lontong, lemper, arem-arem and bacang. In China, there is a similar dish called lap (Ëãô) that is a local speciality of the island of Hainan. Hainanese lap is usually bigger in size than Malay ketupat. Lap skin might be woven into pillow-shaped or triangular, the sticky rice is filled with pork belly. Outside China, lap can also can be found in Port Dickson in Malaysia and Singapore.

It is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines, South India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma, where it is called mont kalama. It is made from coconut milk, jaggery, and rice flour, and is sticky, thick, and sweet. Cultural significance In Muslim majority countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, dodol is commonly served during festivals, such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha as sweet treats for children. The Betawi people take pride in making homemade dodol during the Lebaran (Eid ul-Fitr), where family members will gather together to make dodol. Traditional home made dodol Betawi production center is located in Pasar Minggu area, South Jakarta. The town of Garut in West Java is the main production center of dodol in Indonesia. In Indonesia, durian dodol is popular in Medan and other Sumatran cities. Many flavours of dodol are available, including a durian flavor called lempuk, which is available in Asian food stores. Dodol is also popular among the Roman Catholics from the Indian west coast, also known as the former Estado da √çndia Portuguesa, which includes East Indians from Mumbai, the state of Goa, and the city of Mangalore. Dodol Hj Ideris manufactures dodol and the company has now entered the Middle Eastern market, including Iran.Market For Dodol Hj Ideris Expands To Middle East History The history of dodol production is closely related to one of its main ingredients, gula aren or palm sugar, a traditional sugar made from the sap of Arenga pinnata plant, and also rice flour. It is a popular sweet treat and one of the oldest indigenous sweets developed in the Maritime Southeast Asia. The exact origin of dodol is unclear, nevertheless, dodol shows its remarkable diversity in the island of Java and Sumatra, although the variants are adaptations of post-colonial crops. In Javanese language it is called jenang, while in Sundanese of West Java \\"dodol\\". Dodol is believed to have been introduced to Southern India and Sri Lanka by Indonesians. It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several dodol recipes have been developed in Sri Lanka, such as kalu dodol. A related dessert in the Philippines is known as kalamay (literally \\"sugar\\"), which is made from sugarcane sugar instead of palm sugar. It also has a liquid consistency unlike dodol, since it uses ground glutinous rice rather than rice flour. However, the basic ingredients and preparation is similar. In Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago of the southern Philippines, dodol is more similar to the Indonesian and Malaysian variants and is known by the same name. It is usually prepared into thick cylinders wrapped in corn husks or coloured cellophane that is then cut into disks before serving. Although, like the kalamay, Filipino dodol is made with ground glutinous rice paste and muscovado sugarcane sugar, not palm sugar. Preparation Dodol susu, milk-based dodol from Pangalengan, Bandung Dodol is made from coconut milk, jaggery, and rice flour, and is sticky, thick, and sweet. The cooking process would reduce the contents up to half as the liquid evaporates. It normally takes up to 9 hours to cook. During the entire cooking process, the dodol must be constantly stirred in a big wok. Pausing in between would cause it to burn, spoiling the taste and aroma. The dodol is completely cooked when it is firm, and does not stick to one's fingers when touching it. Actually now there are dodol arrowroot with various flavors such as strawberries, guava, durian, and others. In addition to various flavors, there is now also one producer of garut dodol that combines chocolate and dodol to be used as souvenirs from the city, commonly called 'chocodot' or chocolate dodol. Variants A sample of durian cake made from durian-flavoured lempok, which is similar, but is not toffee-like dodol. =Indonesia= The Indonesians are the most adventurous and creative in concocting dodol.

The word 'congee' itself is a derivation of the Tamil word ka√±ci or kanji. When eaten as plain rice congee, it is most often served with side dishes. When additional ingredients such as meat, fish, and flavourings are added while preparing the congee, it is most often served as a meal on its own, especially for persons who are ill. Names for congee are as varied as the style of its preparation. Despite its many variations, it is usually a thick porridge of rice largely disintegrated after prolonged cooking in water. Etymology The word congee comes from Tamil (kanji), a prominent food of the Tamil people of Ancient India. The English form may have arrived in the language via Portuguese traders.  Preparation  To prepare the dish, rice is boiled in a large amount of water until it softens significantly. Congee can be made in a pot or in a rice cooker. Some rice cookers have a \\"congee\\" setting, allowing it to be cooked overnight. The type of rice used can be either short- or long-grain, depending on what is available and regional cultural influences. Culture also often dictates the way congee is cooked and eaten. In some cultures, congee is eaten primarily as a breakfast food or late supper; some may also eat it as a substitute for rice at other meals. It is often considered particularly suitable for the sick as a mild, easily digestible food.Robert Saunders (1789) \\"Boutan & Thibet\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Vol. 79, p. 101  By country  = Burma = In Burma (now called Myanmar), rice congee is called hsan byoke or hsan pyoke, literally \\"(uncooked) rice boiled\\". It is plain porridge, often made with just rice and water, but sometimes with chicken or pork stock and served with a simple garnish of chopped spring onions and crispy fried onions. = China =  Mainland China  Chinese fish congee with alt=Thick, brown, medium textured porridge in bowl next to plate of fried tofu. While plain congee is a staple dish in China, it is called congee only in Hong Kong English but is more commonly recognised as j≈´k. Natively, plain congee is the known by other local names such as b√°izh≈çu () in Central and Northern China. Chinese congees () vary considerably by region. For example, to make Cantonese congee, white rice is boiled in many times its weight in water for a long time until the rice breaks down and becomes a fairly thick, white porridge. Congees made in other regions may use different types of rice with different quantities of water, producing congees of different consistencies: it can be left watery, or cooked until it has a texture similar to Western oatmeal porridge. Congee can also be made from brown rice, although this is less common and takes longer to cook. Congee made from other grains, such as cornmeal, millet, barley, and sorghum, are common in the north of China where rice does not grow as well as other grains suited for a colder climate. Multigrain congee mixes are sold in the health food sections of Chinese supermarkets. Savory congee, generally cooked with salt and often fresh ginger and other flavorful ingredients, is usually eaten with zhacai, salted duck eggs, lettuce and dace (Chinese mud carp paste), bamboo shoots, youtiao, rousong, pickled tofu, wheat gluten, with other condiments, meats and organ meats including tripe and intestine, crab or hundred-year eggs. Other seasonings such as white pepper and soy sauce may be added after the congee is cooked. Grilled or steamed and deboned fish may be mixed in to provide a different texture. Plain congee is commonly eaten with youtiao (lightly salted fried crullers) as breakfast in many areas in China. Congee with mung beans is usually eaten with sugar, as is red bean congee, or in Laba congee. Besides being an everyday meal, congee is considered to be food therapy for the unwell. Ingredients can be determined by their supposed therapeutic value as well as flavor. It is also used to feed infants. The origin of congee is unknown, but from many historical accounts, it was usually served during times of famine, or when numerous patrons visited the temples, as a way to stretch the rice supply to feed more people. The Autumn porridge festival is celebrated by villagers eating congee together on that day, the meaning being that they pray for everything to go smoothly and to build a good relationship with the neighborhood. A village called Lingshuicun to the West of Beijing celebrates Liu Maoheng, a Qing-era Juren who helped villagers during a period of famine, through the autumn porridge festival.3139\\\\.

Once the bobar is finished just like regular bobar, a variety of toppings can be added to enhance the taste such as, bean sprout, green onions, cilantro, pepper, along with the dried fish and chhakhvay on the side. = India = In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or the thick supernatant water from overcooked rice, is known as (). Kanji is also prepared with different grains available in different parts of Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize. The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state , and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. is prepared by drying sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses (sago) in . Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months. In the Konkan region of India, congee is known as , is a home remedy for treating a fever as it is easy to digest. The farming and manual labour community of the same region, on the other hand, consume on a daily basis in the late morning as a source of energy. Variants of the dish include (ambil) which is made with ragi and rice, or is a sweeter version which is made with rice, fenugreek and jaggery, which is usually served to a nursing mother. The rice here is usually eaten boiled, with dry fish, vegetables or pickles. In the state of Kerala, is considered as the main course particularly for dinner by the majority. This is normally taken with roasted coconut chutney, tossed mung bean known locally as , roasted (lentil crackers), (a side dish consisting mainly of root tubers/underground stems, especially during Thiruvathira); sometimes coconut scrapings are also added to the kanji to increase the flavour. The royal households as well as rich people used to have a special kind of called as (lit. 'milk congee') where milk was substituted for water base. During the Malayalam month of Karkkidakam, a medicinal is made using Ayurvedic herbs, milk and jaggery. Karkkidakam is known as the month of diseases since the monsoon starts during Karkkidakam. is eaten to promote the immune system. Poor households of Kerala used to re-cook leftover rice and all available leftover curries into congee water and take as a mix-mash dish known as (old congee). means old congee (leftover from the previous day). It is not necessarily eaten by poor people, neither it is necessarily re-heated with leftover curries. According to the Indian writer Madhur Jaffrey, is, or derives from, a Tamil word for \\"boiling\\"‚Äîwhich refers to the porridge and also to any water in which rice has been cooked. Muslims of south India especially Tamil Muslim, Mappila and Beary prepare special congee during Ramadhan called (lit. 'fasting porridge'). This is prepared by adding spices like turmeric, dry ginger, pepper, onion, and coconut paste to the congee. Sometimes fenugreek seeds are added to it to enhance the flavour. In the Goa, Udupi and Mangalore districts, people usually eat rice in a variant manner made by Kannada-speaking, Tulu-speaking or Konkani people in and around Udupi and Mangalore (Karnataka, South India). There, parboiled rice ( in Kannada, for black rice, for white rice in Tulu or in Konkani) is steamed with a large amount of water. Jain ganji matt are famous in these districts. Usually, simple ganji with pickle and milk are served, in jain matts. Fresh coconut is grated, and the resulting milk skimmed and added to the ganji (called paez or pyaaz in Konkani), which is served hot with fish curry, coconut chutney, or Indian pickles. In Goa, it is normally served with dried or fresh cooked fish, papad or vegetables. In the state of Andhra Pradesh, it is called ganji in Telugu and mostly eaten by the very poor. Ganji is made by boiling rice in large amounts of water and then the filtered liquid is known as Ganji. Ganji mixed with buttermilk is believed to add to the flavor, and is also suggested by doctors for patients with ailing health. Kaanji is a traditional Odia dish. It is a soup-based dish like dal, but tastes a little sour. It is made of rice starch fermented for a few days in an earthen pot. This is considered a healthy dish as many winter vegetables are used as main ingredients. It is seasoned with mustard seeds and turmeric and served hot.. Pakhala is a separate dish with certain similarities to the congee. In the Buddhist YƒÅgu Sutta of the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya (AN 5.207), the Buddha recommends eating rice porridge, \\"yƒÅgu\\": \\"There are these five benefits in rice porridge. What five? It stills hunger, dispels thirst, settles wind, cleans out the bladder, and promotes the digestion of the remnants of undigested food. These are the five benefits of rice porridge.\\". = Indonesia = Bubur ayam, Indonesian chicken congee In Indonesian, congee is called bubur, and it is a favourite breakfast food in the country. Travelling bubur ayam vendors frequently pass through residential streets in the morning selling the dish. A popular version is bubur ayam, which is rice congee with shredded chicken meat. It is also served with many condiments, such as green onion, crispy fried shallot, fried soybean, Chinese crullers (youtiao, known as in Indonesia), both salty and sweet soy sauce, and sometimes it is topped with yellow chicken broth and kerupuk (Indonesian style crackers). Unlike many other Indonesian dishes, it is not spicy; sambal or chili paste is served separately. The food hawkers sometimes have sate to go with it, made from quail egg or chicken intestine, liver, gizzard, or heart. On Bali's north coast, famously in a village called Bondalem, there is a local congee dish called mengguh, a popular local chicken and vegetable rice congee that is spicier than common bubur ayam and more similar to tinutuan, using a spice mix of onions, garlic, coriander seeds, pepper and chili. In another region of Indonesia ‚Äî the city of Manado in North Sulawesi, there is a very popular type of congee called tinutuan, or also known as bubur Manado (Manadonese porridge). It is rice porridge served with ample amount of vegetables. A bit different from the one sold in Java, it is made from rice porridge, enriched with vegetables, including kangkung (water spinach), corn kernels, yam or sweet potato, dried salted fish, kemangi (lemon basil) leaves and melinjo (Gnetum gnemon) leaves. Sago flour is made into porridge in eastern Indonesia, as the staple food of Maluku and Papuan people. The sago congee is called papeda, and usually is eaten with yellow soup made from tuna or mubara fish spiced with turmeric and lime. = Japan = alt=Grains of white rice still hold their shape in brothy porridge mixed with green herbs Rice porridge breakfast in Kyoto , or often is the name for the type of congee eaten in Japan, which typically uses water to rice ratios of 5:1 or 7:1 and is cooked for about 30 minutes. Kayu may be made with just rice and water, and is often seasoned with salt. Eggs can be beaten into it to thicken it into gruel. Toppings may be added to enhance flavour; Welsh onion, salmon, roe, ginger, and umeboshi (pickled ume fruit) are among the most common. Miso or chicken stock may be used to flavor the broth. Most Japanese electric rice cookers have a specific setting for cooking congee. In Japan kayu ‚Äì because it is soft and easily digestible ‚Äì is regarded as a food particularly suitable for serving to invalids and the elderly. For similar reasons kayu is commonly the first solid food served to Japanese infants; it is used to help with the transition from liquids to normally cooked \\"plain\\" rice, the latter being a major part of the Japanese diet. A type of kayu referred to as nanakusa-gayu (, \\"seven herb porridge\\") is traditionally eaten on 7 January with special herbs that some believe protect against evils and invite good luck and longevity in the new year. As a simple, light dish, nanakusa-gayu serves as a break from the many heavy dishes eaten over the Japanese New Year. Kayu is also used in Shinto divination rituals. is a similar dish, which uses already cooked rice, rather than cooking the rice in the soup. = North Korea and South Korea = alt=Light golden colored porridge is topped with strips of green and drizzles of oil (black sesame porridge) (; ) is a Korean category for porridges made by boiling rice and/or other grains or legumes, such as beans, sesame, nuts, and pumpkin, with much more water than . is often eaten warm, especially as a morning meal, but is now eaten at any time of the day. Depending on the ingredients and consistency, can be considered as food for recuperation, a delicacy, or famine food. Juk Doosan Encyclopedia It is known to have nutritional benefits, and is considered to be beneficial to digestion because of its soft texture. It is a staple \\"get well\\" dish; a dish to eat when one is sick or recovering from bad health.\\"Rice porridge (Juk) A Practical source of nutrition\\" Paik Jae-Eun, professor of food and nutrition, Bucheon College, 2008 Spring Koreana.

There are more than forty varieties of mentioned in old documents. The most basic form of , made from plain rice, is called (; 'rice porridge') or (; 'white porridge'). Being largely unflavored, it is served with a number of more flavorful side dishes, such as (salted seafood), various types of kimchi, and other side dishes. Notable varieties include made from finely ground pine nuts, made with abalones, made from (Coix lacryma-jobi var. ma-yuen), and made from red beans. * () ‚Äì jujube porridge * () ‚Äì chicken porridge * () ‚Äì sweetfish porridge * () ‚Äì black sesame porridge * () ‚Äì pumpkin porridge * () ‚Äì beef porridge * () ‚Äì pine nut porridge * () ‚Äì abalone rice porridge * () ‚Äì red bean porridge * () ‚Äì milk porridge = Laos = In Laos, congee is called khao piak, literally \\"wet rice\\" (, ). It is cooked with rice and chicken broth or water. The congee is then garnished with fried garlic, scallions and pepper. The dish will sometimes be served with chicken, quail eggs, century eggs or youtiao. In Laos, congee is usually eaten as breakfast and during the cold season. = Philippines = Bulacan Lugaw na tokwa't baboy, rice gruel with tokwa at baboy (tofu and pork, commonly referred to as \\"LTB\\" alt=Golden yellow porridge garnished with scallions and fried bits Lugaw (pronounced ) is the Filipino generic term for rice gruel. It encompasses a wide variety of dishes, ranging from savory dishes very similar to Chinese-style congee to dessert dishes. In the Visayan regions, savory lugaw are known as pospas. Lugaw typically use glutinous rice (Tagalog: malagkit; Visayan: pilit). It is usually thicker than other Asian congees, retaining the shape of the rice, yet with a similar texture. Savory versions of lugaw are flavored with ginger and traditionally topped with scallions and toasted garlic. Dried red safflower (kasubha) may also be used as a topping, mainly as a visual garnish and to impart a more appealing yellow tinge to the dish. As with Japanese okayu, fish or chicken stock may be used to flavor the broth. The most popular variants of lugaw include arroz caldo (chicken), goto (beef tripe), lugaw na baboy (pork), lugaw na baka (beef), and lugaw na tokwa't baboy (diced tofu and pork). Other versions can also use tinapa (smoked fish), palaka (frog legs), utak (brain [of pig]), dila (tongue [of pig]), and litid ([beef] ligaments). They are traditionally seasoned with calamansi, fish sauce (patis), soy sauce (toyo), and black pepper. It is often served to the ill and the elderly, and is favored among Filipinos living in colder climates because it is warm, soft, and easy to digest. Dessert versions of lugaw include champorado (lugaw with home-made chocolate topped with milk), binignit (lugaw in coconut milk with various fruits and root crops), and ginataang mais (lugaw with sweet corn and coconut milk), among others. Like the savory versions, they are usually eaten for breakfast, but can also be eaten as a snack. In Hiligaynon-speaking areas, lugaw may refer to binignit. = Portugal = In Portugal, a traditional soup made of rice and chicken meat is named canja or Canja de galinha. The Portuguese likely picked up the dish from their colony in Goa, India; where the soup remains a staple (particularly for the ill). The rice is not cooked for as long as in Asian congee, so it is very soft, but not disintegrated. Traditionally, a boiling fowl containing small, immature eggs is used; the eggs are carefully boiled and served in the canja. This soup is sometimes served with a fresh mint leaf on top. Strongly valued as comfort food, it is traditionally given to people recovering from disease, as in Asia, and in some regions of Portugal, there is even an ancient custom of feeding the mother a strict diet of canja in the first weeks after childbirth. It is also eaten traditionally in Brazil and Cape Verde, former Portuguese colonies. = Singapore = In Singapore, Teochew porridge or Singapore-style porridge is a version of Singapore congee. In Singapore, it's considered a comfort food for both breakfast as well as supper. Teochew porridge dish often accompanied with various small plates of side dishes. Usually, it's served as a banquet of meats, fish egg and vegetables eaten with plain rice porridge. The recipes that early immigrants prepared in Singapore have been modified over the generations to suit local tastes. Singapore Teochew style porridge is usually consumed with a selection of Singaporean Chinese side dishes like Nasi Padang. There is no fixed list of side dishes, but in Singapore, accompaniments typically include lor bak (braised pork), steamed fish, stir-fried water spinach (kangkong goreng), salted egg, fish cake, tofu, omelette, minced meat, braised tau kway, Hei Bee Hiang (fried shrimp chilli paste), and vegetables. = Sri Lanka = In Sri Lanka, several types of congee are known as kenda in Sinhalese. Sinhala people use congee as a breakfast, a side dish, an accessory to indigenous medical therapies, and a sweet. Kenda can be prepared with many ingredients, including rice, roasted rice, rice flour, finger millet flour, sago, coconut milk, herbs, tubers, kitul flour, and mung bean. When it is prepared with rice and water only, it is known as hal kenda. If salt is added to bring a much saltier taste, it is known as lunu kenda, a dish commonly used as a supplementary diet in purgation therapy in indigenous medical traditions. If roasted rice is used, the congee becomes bendi hal kenda, utilized to treat diarrheal diseases. If rice flour and coconut milk are the main ingredients, such congee is known as kiriya. If finger millet flour and water is used, it is known as kurakkan anama. If coconut milk is added, the dish is called kurakkan kenda. If sago is used, such congee is known as sawu kenda. A special type of congee prepared from the byproducts of coconut oil production is known as pol kiri kenda. There are many varieties of kola kenda, congee with herbs as an ingredient; sometimes, a vaidya or veda mahttaya (a physician trained in indigenous medical traditions) might prescribe a special type of kola kenda, known under such circumstances as behet kenda. Sinhala villagers use specific tubers for preparing congee, such as Diascorea species tubers. If kitul flour is mixed with boiling water and coconut milk added to it, this special type of congee is known as kitul piti kenda. Kenda prepared with mung beans is known as mung eta kenda. Most of the time, kiriya, kurakkan kenda, sawu kenda, pol kiri kenda and kitul piti kenda are used as sweets. Sugar, candy, dates, raisins, cashew nut, jaggery, and treacle are among the ingredients that may be added to sweeten these congees. Congee is also eaten by Sri Lankan Moors for iftar during Ramadan. It is also occasionally made with oats. Tamils and Moors in Sri Lanka call it (rice ) and use chicken or beef for it. It is sometimes made with milk (paal kanji), and there are many other combinations with appropriate prefixes in Tamil. = Thailand = Chok mu sap: Thai rice congee with minced pork Chok Prince or written Jok Prince, a Bib Gourmand chok eatery in Bang Rak In Thai cuisine, rice congee, known as chok (, , a loanword from Min Nan Chinese), is often served as breakfast with a raw or partially cooked egg added. Minced pork or beef and chopped spring onions are usually added, and the dish is optionally topped with a small donut-like pathongko, fried garlic, slivered ginger, and spicy pickles such as pickled radish. Although it is more popular as a breakfast dish, many stores specializing in chok sell it throughout the day. Variations in the meat and toppings are also frequently found. It is especially popular during Thailand's cool season. Thai congee is prepared similarly to Lao congee. Plain rice congee, known as khao tom kui (), is served at specialty restaurants, which serve a multitude of side dishes to go with it, such as yam kun chiang (a Thai salad made with sliced dried Chinese sausages), mu phalo (pork stewed in soy sauce and five-spice powder), and mu nam liap (minced pork fried with chopped Chinese olives). For notable chok eateries in Bangkok viz Bang Rak on Charoen Krung, which is the Bib Gourmand from Michelin Guidebook, and Talat Noi in Chinatown beside Wat Traimit near Hua Lamphong, with Chok Chai neighbourhood in Lat Phrao, for sale here 24 hours and has many franchise in various places. In khao tom kui such as Yaowarat, and Wong Wian Yi Sip Song Karakadakhom (July 22 Circle) neighbourhoods etc. In a popular reference within the 2011 US comedy film The Hangover Part II set in Thailand, chok is described as being a food for ‚Ä≥small babies and very old people‚Ä≥ with ‚Ä≥no taste‚Ä≥ that is nourishment ‚Ä≥everybody can digest‚Ä≥. The reference is used to describe the character of the protagonist Stu Price (portrayed by Ed Helms). = Vietnam = A simple ch√°o In Vietnam, rice congee, called ch√°o (), is sometimes cooked with pandan leaves or Asian mung bean. In its simplest form (plain rice porridge, known as ch√°o hoa), it is a food for times of famine and hardship to stretch the rice ration. Alternately, as is especially common among Buddhist monks, nuns and lay persons, it can be a simple breakfast food eaten with pickled vegetables or fermented tofu (chao). Vietnamese congee with youtiao Despite its ubiquity among the poor, it is also popular as a main dish when cooked with a variety of meats. For example, ch√°o g√† is cooked with chicken, garlic, and ginger. The rice porridge is cooked in chicken broth, and when the chicken is cooked, the meat is sliced and layered on a bed of shredded raw cabbage and sliced scallions and drizzled with a vinegar-based sauce, to be eaten as a side dish. Other combinations include ch√°o v·ªãt (duck porridge), which is cooked in the same manner as chicken porridge. Ch√°o l√≤ng heo is made with l√≤ng heo, a variety of offal from pork or duck with sliced portions of congealed pork blood. Ch√°o is typically served with qu·∫©y on the side. is a congee containing pig kidney (). A specialty of the H√≥c M√¥n District in Ho Chi Minh City, it is typically eaten in rural areas of southern Vietnam. Well-known vendors include , , and . (Originally in Ph√°p lu·∫≠t & X√£ h·ªôi.) Another typical Vietnamese dish is , a congee with mushrooms. Youtiao is usually added to congee especially at congee vendors. It is also common to eat ch√°o when ill, as it is believed the porridge is easy to digest while being fortifying. For such purposes, the ch√°o is sometimes cooked with roasted white rice, giving the porridge broth a more nuanced body and a subtle, nutty flavor. In some parts of Vietnam, local customs call for making ch√°o as offerings for the \\"wandering souls\\" during the Buddhist Vu Lan summer feast.

This process uses a metal billet or ingot which is inserted in a chamber. One side of this contains a die to produce the desired cross section and the other side a hydraulic ram is present to push the metal billet or ingot. Metal flows around the profile of the die and after solidification takes the desired shape. Extrusion process can be done with the material hot or cold, but most of the metals are heated before the process, if high surface finish and tight tolerances are required then the material is not heated. DFM stands for design for manufacturing, so as the name suggest the design is manufacturing friendly, in simple terms design that can be manufactured easily and cheaply. DFM guidelines define a set of rules for a person designing a product to ease the manufacturing process, reduce cost and time. For example, if a hole is to be drilled, if the designer specifies a standard hole size then it reduces the cost because the drill bits of unusual sizes are not readily available they have to be custom made. Material based guidelines Nowadays, quite a wide variety of metals are currently extruded commercially, the most common are (in order of decreasing extudability): Aluminium, Magnesium and their alloys, Copper and Copper alloys, low-carbon and medium-carbon steels, low-alloy steels and stainless steels.George E. Dieter, Howard A. Kuhn, S. Lee Semiatin (2003) 'Extrusion', in (ed.) Handbook of Workability and Process Design. : , pp. 291-292. So obviously as the extrudability decrease the cost of production increases # For an extruded part a material should be selected from the top side of the series given above i.e. from Aluminium and Magnesium side but without changing the functionality because high extrudability properties also mean less strength. So as explained above, considering this guideline while designing leads to ease in the manufacturing process of the parts which in turn leads to cost savings. # This point generally applies when the quantity of parts required is small. So generally when you put an order for extruded parts there is customarily a minimum weight for each order of a special cross section. For example, the minimum quantity may be 1000 kg for carbon steel, 500 kg for stainless, and 80 kg for aluminum. The net result is that the most economical operation takes place at moderately low production quantities or higher. Geometry based guidelines =Metal Thickness= * It is often acceptable to have a different range of thicknesses however, a profile with uniform metal thickness is easy to extrude. In many cases, uniform metal thickness reduces the die stresses and improves productivity. Common Commercially Available extrusion profiles =Extrusion Profile= * Although extrusion can produce very intricate shaped profiles but it is beneficial to limit irregularities of shape as much as the function of the part permits. This is because metal flows less readily into narrow and intricate sections that leads to defects in parts. Besides, these the irregular sections lead to unbalanced stresses in dies and on the part too which cause distortion and other quality problems. * Manufacturing of a complex cross-section is difficult and expensive, it involves tooling cost as a die of that cross section has to be manufactured. There are some standard shapes available from extrusion shops and metal supplier, a designer can choose any of these shapes if it serves his purpose. This saves the tooling cost associated with manufacturing a complex die for the profile and simplifies the manufacturing.James Bralla (1999) 'CHAPTER 3.1 METAL EXTRUSIONS', in (ed.) Design for Manufacturability Handbook. : McGraw Hill Professional, pp. 3.3-3.14. =Radius at Edges and Corners= * Having a radius at edges and corners advantageous because metals does not flows easily into the corners, so keeping round corners and edges eliminates any type of defect that may arise due to sharp corners and edges. These are the common problems faced while extruding a sharp corner:; ** Less smooth flow of material through the die, leading to increased dimensional variations and surface irregularities in the extruded part ** Increased tool wear and increased possibility of tool breakage ** Less strength in the extruded part owing to stress concentrations * The minimum amount of radius required to avoid any defect and problems depends on the extrudability of the material, as the material is more extrudable it can flow in corners with less radius. For example, for Aluminium, Magnesium and Copper alloys the minimum radius required for corners and edges is 0.75 mm whereas for ferrous metals for corners 1.5 mm and for edges 3 mm minimum radius is required. Good And Bad Practices while designing the cross section in Extrusion Process =Holes= * Extrusion profiles with holes are very difficult to produce because they can not be just produced by a simple die, so it should be practiced to reduce the number of holes as much as possible. * With steels and other less extrudable materials, holes in nonsymmetrical shapes should be avoided because they lead to unsymmetrical stresses which cause warpage in the part. * In hollow sections the section walls should be as balanced as much as the design function permits because die strain and extrusion distortion tend to occur with unbalanced cross sections. Comparison of Maximum Indentation Depth possible for Steel, Copper, Aluminium and Magnesium Alloy =Depth of Indentation= * In steel extrusions, the depth of an indentation should be no greater than its width at its narrowest point. This is necessary to provide sufficient strength in the tongue portion of the extruding die. In copper alloys, magnesium, and aluminum, the depth of an indentation may be greater since extrusion pressures are lower. =Symmetry= * Symmetrical cross sections are always preferred to nonsymmetrical cross sections because it contains unbalances stresses which lead to warpage in the part and causes damage to the tools. Sometimes if a part cannot be converted into symmetric shape then two of them are clubbed together to form a symmetric shape and they are cut off in two after extrusion. =Tolerances= * For best dimensional control (when component requirements are exacting), a secondary drawing operation is added after the extrusion of most metals. Although such an operation is entirely feasible, it does entail additional tooling, handling, and cost. Therefore, the designer should specify liberal enough tolerances, if possible, so that secondary drawing operations are not required. *If long, thin sections have a critical flatness requirement, variations from flatness are reduced if ribs are added to the section. =Others= * All the transitions in cross section should be as smooth as possible because sudden changes in cross sections are difficult to produce because metal does not readily flow there. * The corners should me made in round shape instead of flat because it strengthens tongue and facilitates easy flow of metals.

Gomul can be made with powdered dried soybeans, azuki beans, or sesame seeds, or sliced dried jujube. Subsidiary ingredients are mixed into the steamed rice while pounding it on the anban (ÏïàÎ∞ò, wooden pounding board).

After cooking, the banana leaf is removed and the cake is sliced into wheel-shaped servings. Etymology Although b√°nh t√©t or b√°nh t√†y are made and consumed during T·∫øt (the Vietnamese new year), the \\"t√©t\\" in the food's name literally means \\"sliced\\" or \\"split\\", possibly referring to the fact that it is served in slices. \\"B√°nh\\" is used to refer to various baked and grilled food including small packages or \\"cakes\\", sandwiches, crepes, and spring rolls.Bnh Process The process of making b√°nh t√©t usually begins in preparation for T·∫øt where the ingredients are prepared then cooked for at least six hours in a pot of boiling water. The first step is assembling the ingredients - glutinous rice, mung bean paste or soaked mung bean and pork belly. Next, the ingredients are layered on top of banana leaves before wrapped together tightly with strings. To prevent the banana leaf from coming apart during cooking, b√°nh t√©t are usually wrapped again several times with a length of plastic ribbon or rope before boiling in a large pot of water. Traditions B√°nh t√©t (or the original b√°nh ch∆∞ng) is a must-have traditional food in Vietnamese Lunar New Year. It demonstrates the importance of rice in the Vietnamese culture as well as historical value. During Vietnamese T·∫øt, family members would gather together and enjoy feasting on b√°nh t√©t, the central food of this festive Vietnamese holiday to celebrate the coming of spring. The process of making b√°nh t√©t is time consuming, but a tradition that many families still practice even in this modern society where pre-made b√°nh t√©t and b√°nh ch∆∞ng are sold virtually in every Vietnamese store. It is the effort that counts and many choose to spend time with their family to create the holiday treat the traditional way.

Preparation The filling is made with a combination of cream cheese, crab meat or imitation crab meat, scallions or onion, garlic, and other flavorings. A small amount of the filling is wrapped in each Chinese wonton wrapper. The dumpling is then shaped by folding the wrapper over into a triangle, by creating a four-pointed star, by gathering it up into flower or purse shape, or by twisting it into the traditional wonton shape. The appetizers are cooked to crispness by deep-frying in vegetable oil or by baking. They can be served hot or cold. In North America, crab Rangoon is often served with a sauce for dipping: either soy sauce, plum sauce, duck sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or hot Chinese mustard.

It includes thirteen historic properties, mainly Greek Revival in character, extending north along Maine State Route 117, north of its junction with Simpson Road, and two on the latter street, that were all built between about 1800 and 1850. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Salmon Falls area, divided between Buxton and Hollis by the Saco River, developed beginning in the late 18th century as a modest agricultural area, and the falls on the river, for which it is named, were developed in the second quarter of the 19th century with small scale industrial operations. The road that is now Maine State Route 117 was the main road in the area leading north from the port of Saco, and became the focus for development on the Buxton side of the village. The area declined economically in the second half of the 19th century, and further growth was consequently quite limited. The district is centered along a stretch of Route 117 extending south from a bend in the Saco River to the road's junction with Simpson and Elden Roads. Eleven properties line this piece of road, with another two on Simpson and Elden completing the district inventory. The oldest house, the Elden family homestead, stands on the south side of Elden Road, and is a fine Federal-style estimated to date to the 1790s. The Came-Marshall House, located just northwest of the junction, is probably the most impressive house in the district: it is a 2-1/2 story Federal-style brick structure, with an elaborate entry that has sidelight windows and a semi-circular fanlight. Most of the houses in the district, however, were built between 1825 and 1850, and are Greek Revival in character. Most are wood-frame structures 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height, although one is built out of brick. The latest building in the district is the c. 1868 Darrah Tavern, which anchors the district's northern end.

It was conducted by the British Special Boat Service, against the mixed German and Italian garrison on the island of Santorini (Thera) in the Aegean Sea. The raid was made in tandem with similar operations at the islands of Ios, Mykonos and Amorgos that aimed to destroy Axis naval observation posts and radio stations on the Cycladic islands.Mortimer, Gavin. The Special Boat Squadron in WW2, Osprey, 2013, .Lewis, Damien. Churchill's Secret Warriors, Quercus 2014, . Background During the winter of 1943, the Germans had secured their control of the Aegean archipelago. In spring 1944, they still maintained appreciable garrisons on Greek isles. The British wished to maintain a secondary front in the Aegean, therefore, after the fall of Kos and Leros, the Middle East HQ issued orders to the SBS special forces unit to attack the garrisons of occupied Greek islands such as Santorini.Gartzonikas, Panagiotis. Operations in the Aegean Sea 1943-1945. Operational Effectiveness and Strategic Implications, MSc thesis, Naval Postgraduate School, 2003. The raid On April 19, a group of 19 commandos under Major Anders Lassen sailed from their hideout in Balisu bay, Turkey aboard two schooners. After a three-day voyage that included intermediate stops in Syrna and Anydros, the group landed on an easterly beach near cape Columbo on the night of 22 to 23. They marched towards the village of Vourvoulos and after contacting the locals, the group hid in a nearby cave. The two schooners sought shelter in the nearby Christiana islands, southwest of Santorini.Langley, Mike. Anders Lassen VC, MC of the SAS, Pen and Sword, 2016, . One member of the group of commandos was the Greek Lieutenant Stefan Casulli (). On April 23, Casulli was guided by locals to the capital Fira to gather intelligence. Based on Casulli's information, Lassen decided to divide his forces into three detachments. The first would attack the barracks in Fira, the second would head to the residence of the German commanding officer (Lieutenant Hesse) in Fira and attempt to capture him while the third would target the radio station in Imerovigli. This radio had a long range and served as a relay supporting communications between Athens and Crete. The zero hour for the attack was set to 00:45 of April 24 and the three detachments were led to their targets by local guides. The barracks were located in the centre of Fira, on the second floor of a building that housed a bank. The attackers came from two different directions and in spite of barking dogs, they managed to surprise the 40-strong garrison and eliminate most of them. During the attack, Casulli received a shot in the chest and died immediately. Sergeant Frank Kingston was also shot in the abdomen and succumbed to his wounds a few hours later. The attack against the German commanding officer was unsuccessful as he and a few others managed to flee unscathed. The building housing the radio installation was blown up with time bombs. The commandos escaped using their two schooners, taking with them some of the locals who had helped them. Reprisals On April 29, German reinforcements from the island of Milos surrounded Vourvoulos. They amassed all local men aged 14 and older and threatened them with reprisals if they did not reveal those who helped the commandos. A few villagers admitted their involvement and were sent to the firing squad. In all, a total of five men, among them the village mayor, were executed. It is unclear why the rest of the villagers and the village itself was spared. It has been claimed that this was the result of a letter written to Lt Hesse by Lassen, warning him that his name was known to the Allies who would hold him accountable for any reprisals he ordered. A monument commemorating the victims has been erected in Vourvoulos. Aftermath Two commandos died in the operation and five civilians were shot in reprisal. Another 13 civilians from Imerovigli who were hoping to sack German provisions in the radio building died when the explosives installed in it went off.ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ¥œÅŒøŒºŒÆœÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ Œ£Œ±ŒΩœÑŒøœÅŒØŒΩŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒ∫œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµœÉŒ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøŒØŒ∫œâŒΩ Œ±œÄ' œÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒìŒµœÅŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœçœÇ, archived here The number of German casualties was around 40 and 19 were taken prisoners. Due to its violence, the operation became known as Lassen's Bloodbath. This and similar operations forced the German General Kleemann to instruct his troops that \\"[they were] living in an enemy country\\" and reinforce the Aegean garrisons by 4,000 men. These forces remained tied down in place for the rest of the war, being deprived from other fronts where they were mostly needed. In August 1944, Casulli was posthumously awarded the Greek Cross of Valour.

Publication history The collaboration between DC Comics and IDW Publishing was announced during IDW's panel at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con. A six-part monthly miniseries was written by James Tynion IV and drawn by Freddie Williams II. In addition, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' co-creator Kevin Eastman provided some of the variant covers. Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles =Overview= The Turtles and their arch-enemy the Shredder have been transported to an alternate universe by Krang. Here, in Gotham City, they meet Batman and clash with a series of his famous \\"rogues gallery\\" while attempting to find their way home. =Summary= During a battle with the alien conqueror Krang, the Turtles, their master Splinter and their archenemy Shredder, are transported to an alternate universe with a good number of Foot ninjas. While the Foot attempt to steal various components from labs all around Gotham to work out a means of returning home, as well as abducting a scientist doing research into cross-dimensional travel, the Turtles intercept the various thefts, although the Foot still depart with their gathered equipment. Batman is puzzled by the inhuman descriptions of some of the participants and at the fact that the crimes were committed by ninjas. Predicting a break-in at one of his own facilities, he takes out the raiding Foot ninjas and has a brief encounter with the Shredder before the latter retreats. The Turtles have in the meantime set up a new base in the Gotham sewers, but Killer Croc stumbles upon their lair while tracking Batman. After defeating Croc and his men, the Turtles are forced to relocate, since their hideout has been compromised. The Turtles retreat to the surface to discover the Batmobile parking nearby. When Batman returns to his car from his confrontation with the Shredder, he finds the Turtles milling aboutBatman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #1 and fights them until Splinter distracts Batman with a smoke bomb. The Turtles begin to research Batman, and most of them come to admire him, while Raphael just believes him to be a distraction. Having recovered one of Raphael's sai during the fight, Batman takes it to Lucius Fox. Fox's analysis confirms that the dagger is from another universe, but it is reverting to this reality's 'local' version of steel. He also notes that a strange mutagen in a blood sample that Bruce provided him with is incompatible with their laws of physics and anything mutated by it will thus revert to its non-mutated state. Learning about a stolen power generator that could allow them to power the equipment they need to return home, the Shredder and the Foot make a deal with the Penguin to acquire it, only for the Foot to kill all of the Penguin's men. However, the Penguin convinces Shredder to spare him by arguing that he can provide useful local knowledge. Unbeknownst to Batman, Splinter has followed him into the Batcave and learned of their situation and Batman's identity. Reuniting with the Turtles, Splinter leads his sons to the Batcave to ask for help.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #2 Although Batman is initially hostile, Splinter catches Batman off guard by calling him by his real name, which helps them form an uneasy peace. Splinter and the Turtles subsequently lead an assault on the Iceberg Lounge, where the Shredder intends to activate a portal that will return him to his world, also planning to create a permanent link between their worlds so that he can conquer New York and Gotham. However, when the Turtles and Batman attack, the Shredder destroys the portal and kills the scientist who helped him build it, revealing that he also knows of the mutants' impending reversion. Raphael engages the Shredder in battle, but the Shredder injures Raphael and escapes, only to be met by the League of Assassins and Ra's al Ghul, who offers him an alliance.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #3 With the Shredder unaccounted for, the Turtles remain in the Batcave and Wayne Manor. In his growing impatience, Raphael snaps at the lack of progress made in finding a cure, accusing Batman of being simply \\"a rich boy playing at being a hero\\" with no idea about true loss and sacrifice and storms off in a huff. While Raphael is walking through Gotham in disguise, Batman pulls up beside him in the Batmobile and takes him to Crime Alley, where he tells Raphael about the death of his parents and how that loss drove him to become Batman. As Raphael considers this, realizing how wrong he was about Batman, he apologizes and finally starts to accept Batman, the other Turtles alert him to an energy surge in Gotham that they identified as another portal, constructed and activated by Ra's and the Shredder. At the portal they meet Casey Jones, who has attempted to bring his friends some fresh mutagen to stabilize their condition, but was stopped by the villains, who stole the substance and took it with them to a place called \\"Arkham\\".Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #4 Batman, Leonardo and Raphael meet with Commissioner Gordon at the roof of the GCPD and learn that the Penguin has turned informer, revealing that the Shredder and Ra's are intending to attack Arkham. As Leonardo collapses due to the decaying mutagen in his system, Damian returns to the Batcave to find Donatello, Michaelangelo and Casey inside, resulting in a brief fight between them until Batman returns to confirm that the Turtles are his allies. As Damian reports that the League of Assassins are coming to Gotham en masse, Casey reveals that he was provided with equipment that would allow the Turtles to return to their dimension and Batman tells the Turtles to get home before Leonardo's condition gets irreversible. Despite Splinter's warning, Batman and Damian head to Arkham, confident that they can beat the Shredder, only to be confronted by a mass of mutagen-contaminated Arkham inmates (Mr. Freeze as a polar bear, Bane as an elephant, Two-Face as a baboon, etc.), who move in for the attack.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #5 During the resulting fight, Batman is trapped by the mutated Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Confronted by al Ghul and the Shredder, he learns that the two archvillains intend to use the mutagen in every major city of the world, throwing human civilization in chaos and thus paving their ascent to total world domination. Watching all of this via security camera in the Batcave, the Turtles decide to stay and risk their lives to save Batman, despite being given the chance to escape back to their own dimension with Casey. The Turtles arrive just as the Joker is about to kill Batman, and while Splinter fights off the remaining inmates, the Dark Knight battles the Shredder inside his latest Intimidator combat armor and the Turtles engage Ra's al Ghul. Although the Shredder severely injures Batman and damages the Intimidator suit, Batman manages to knock his opponent to the ground and Splinter finishes him off. With the Turtles beating him down, and the League of Assassins disarmed and captured by Damian and the G.C.P.D., al Ghul escapes. Just as the Turtles wonder how they will get back home, a dimensional portal opens and disgorges Casey and April O'Neil. The Turtles round up the Foot ninjas and Shredder and send them back to their original dimension. Before they leave, Raphael gives Batman his mask and tells him that he can now count on the Turtles' aid if he ever shows up in their dimension. Batman and Robin return to the Batcave where they learn from Commissioner Gordon that the situation at Arkham is being stabilized until the mutagen has decayed naturally, turning the inmates back to normal within a week. Damian remembers that it is the anniversary of the death of Bruce's parents and volunteers to leave, but Bruce insists that he stay and they work on the Intimidator Suit together. The final panel shows Raphael's mask lying on the chair of the Batcomputer.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #6 Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II On September 14, 2017, the impending publication of a six-issue sequel miniseries was announced, with the first two issues being released on December 6 and December 20, respectively. This storyline features Bane as the central antagonist. James Tynion IV and Freddie Williams II, who worked on the previous series, return as participants in the project. =Summary= Months after the events of the first crossover, a battle for new leadership of the Foot Clan ensues between the Elite Guard and Shredder's descendant Karai, since the Turtles threw Shredder in prison after returning home. The Turtles confront Karai and the Elite Guard in a New York City Subway tunnel, where Karai escapes and Donatello is rescued by his brothers after failing to defeat the Elite Guardsmen. Back at the lair, Casey and April mend Donatello's wounds and warn the Turtles not to leave the sewers, as Bebop and Rocksteady have formed a third faction of the Foot that wants the Turtles dead. Donatello tells Splinter of his shame of not being as good of a fighter as his brothers and wonders how someone like Batman can balance being a technological genius and master combatant. Hitting upon this idea, he sneaks out of the sewers to Harold Lillja's laboratory, where he activates an experimental multiversal teleportation system to send a message to the Dark Knight, hoping to learn some wisdom from him. The Elite Guardsmen attack Donatello in the lab and wreck some of the fragile technology during the fight. Meanwhile, in Gotham, Batman and Robin likewise deal with a shift in power within the League of Assassins, since a faction no longer trusts Ra's as their leader following his defeat by the Ninja Turtles. They learn of another Lazarus Pit beneath the city and find the faction's new leader, Bane, emerging from it. Before the Dynamic Duo can engage the now stronger villain, the Foot's attack on Donatello causes the teleportation system to malfunction and Donatello and Bane to switch places.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II #1 A week later, the three heroes manage to find all the parts necessary to build the multiversal portal back to Donatello's home dimension. Batman obtains one part from Ra's (who gives it willingly, if only for the slim chance of being able to rid himself of Batman and Bane in one go) while Robin and Donatello get the last part from Mr. Freeze. Batgirl and Lucius Fox finish constructing the portal and tell the trio that they will turn it on once for a minute every 24 hours to avoid any other intruders. Batman leaves Batgirl in charge of protecting Gotham as the three enter the portal. Once they enter the Turtles' dimension, they discover that Bane has nearly conquered the city and taken over a large majority of the Foot Clan, including Bebop and Rocksteady. They reunite with the Turtles, Splinter, April and Casey in the sewer. Raphael expresses outrage at Donatello's mistake that resulted in the city's chaos, but Splinter calms him down and welcomes Batman into their home. April shows the group footage she got of Bane on her phone to determine his movement patterns. Batman observes that Bane's Venom tank on his back is nearly empty and proposes they attack in the next 24 hours, where Bane will be at his most vulnerable. Back at the Foot lair, however, Bane has Bebop and Rocksteady bring him the disgraced scientist Baxter Stockman to create more Venom.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II #2 Damian remains in the Turtles' lair and plunges Donatello back into depression through merciless criticism, which sparks a duel between him and Raphael. Batman, Leonardo and Splinter reconnoiter Stockman's laboratory, where they find Bane in the midst of withdrawal from his lack of Venom. However, Bane is not that incapacitated as to miss their arrival and leaving to get the others; and as soon as the heroes are gone, he and Stockman initiate the next phase of their plan to inject the whole Foot Clan with a newly synthesized Venom-mutagen compound. Thus, when the Turtles, Batman, Splinter and Robin return to the laboratory, they walk right into an ambush; when Bebop and Rocksteady trigger the trap, they accidentally expose Stockman to a mixture of mutagen and fly DNA, turning him into a human fly. Quickly the heroes find themselves surrounded not only by Bane, Bebop and Rocksteady, but also the rest of the Foot Clan, all of them vastly enhanced with both Venom and mutagen.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II #3 Facing these insurmountable odds, Batman attempts to execute an escape tactic, but Robin dashes that prospect with a reckless attack on Bebop, thus triggering a mass brawl. During the fighting, Bane singles out Raphael, beats him down and prepares to break him over his knee, as he had done with Batman once before.Batman #497 (July 1993) Splinter intervenes, saving his son, but his concern for Raphael diverts his attention for a critical moment, enabling Bane to bring the lab's ceiling crashing down on him. Bane and his cohorts retreat to preserve their limited Venom supply, enabling the Turtles to recover their seriously injured father. Back in the lair, a despairing Donatello begins to believe that brains and skill alone will not defeat Bane. He presents a sample of Venom-mutagen he was able to swipe from the lab, along with the intention to synthesize it for their own use; but Batman and most of his friends express their misgivings, forcing him to abandon that plan. As the two teams begin to work on an attack strategy late into the night, however, Donatello secretly sneaks out of the lair with the compound and injects himself with it. In the meantime, Karai and her remaining Foot loyalists begin to stage their own assault on Bane's new headquarters, the Statue of Liberty.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II #4 As a group of Bane's Foot ninjas begin to assemble in order to finalize their master's hold on the city, they are attacked at their meeting place by Donatello, turned into a savage rage monster by the Venom-mutagen. However, Batman and Leonardo have noticed his absence and followed his trail and now desperately try to talk him down. They succeed, after much effort, by appealing to his scientific side, when they reveal that they have found a flaw in Stockman's Venom formula; Donatello, now restored to sanity, notices that Stockman's concoction is imperfect, thus using itself up more rapidly than the standard Venom version. In the meantime, April, Casey and Michelangelo complete the construction of an interdimensional portal and activate it, allowing Raphael, Robin and Splinter to pass into the DC reality, where Batgirl and Nightwing are waiting for them. They descend to the Lazarus Pit beneath Gotham and expose Splinter to its essence to heal his life-threatening injuries. With Splinter and Donatello fully recovered, the two away teams regroup in the Turtles' hideout, just as Bane starts a city-wide broadcast in which he announces that he has taken control of all of New York and demands that its citizens either join his army or subjugate themselves as his slaves. Donatello develops an anti-Venom, which he uses to purge himself of the drug and which he then intends to release from a gas bomb amidst Bane's army on Liberty Island, thus stripping them of their advantage in one stroke. Still, knowing the Foot Clan will remain loyal to Bane unless he is beaten, Batman proceeds to Rikers Island and frees the Shredder from his cell.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II #5 Donatello enacts his plan by flying the Turtle Blimp towards the Statue of Liberty and releasing the Anti-Venom gas from its balloon to depower the Foot Clan. While the rest of the group emerges to free the captive citizens and take on the rest of the turned Foot, assisted by Donatello's electroshock guns and Karai's loyalist faction, Batman, Splinter and Shredder battle Bane at the Statue of Liberty. Shredder regains control over the Foot and the heroes defeat Bane, Bebop and Rocksteady using teamwork and a massive dosage of elephant tranquilizer. Much to the Turtles' surprise, Shredder willingly goes back to prison after the fight, with Batman revealing that he helped on the condition that he would have a beforehand rematch with the Dark Knight. When saying their goodbyes, Batman reassures Donatello that his mistakes and his efforts to rectify them have only served to show him where his true strengths lie and the Bat-Family and Bane return to their home world. Soon afterwards, Donatello finds in his dormitory a note from Batman containing a workout routine for the Robins, which Donatello enthusiastically starts to implement.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II #6 Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III The publication of a third and final installment of the successful crossover storyline was announced on February 15, 2019, for May in the same year. In this series, Krang is installed as Batman and the Turtles' main adversary. =Summary= The story starts in Gotham City, but strangely presents a peculiar amalgamation of the DC Universe and the Turtles' universe. Batman was raised by Splinter alongside the Turtles as a family, Casey Jones is an officer in the Gotham City Police Department, and other influences from the Turtles' reality are also found in various elements of Gotham's scenery.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #1 All this is due to Krang's merciless meddling with the fabric of the Multiverse. In a new background story, it is shown that when Bruce was 8 years old, his parents purchased the Turtles right after their fateful cinema visit, only to come across Joe Chill just having hijacked a truck full of mutagen. Thomas and Martha were run over by the speeding truck, but Bruce was barely pushed to safety by his father. A canister of mutagen was thrown out of the truck and shattered, and in his shock over his parents' death, Bruce accidentally toppled into the sewer. The Turtles and Splinter, a sewer rat, were subsequently transformed into their known mutant forms and took Bruce into their fold.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #3 One stormy night many years later, the \\"Laughing Man\\" (a fusion of the Joker and the Shredder) and his \\"Smile Clan\\" (consisting of Harley Quinn (fused with Karai), Deadshot, Clayface (Clayface fused with Rocksteady) and Killer Croc (a fusion of Bebop and Killer Croc)) undertake a raid on Gotham's natural history museum, where a strange crystal, said to be extradimensional, is displayed. While the GCPD has arrived, all the officers - except Casey - have succumbed to the Laughing Man's offer to join the Smile Clan. Batman takes notice of the raid and proceeds to the museum, followed by the Turtles; they manage to take out most of the henchmen, but the Laughing Man gets his hands on the crystal. As Batman struggles with him, he suddenly has a brief vision of the Laughing Man's true face - the Joker - before the villain and Harley escape by detonating the museum's roof. Later in their sewer hideout, Batman laments the distraction which allowed the Laughing Man to get away, the peculiar familiarity he felt when he beheld the Joker's face, and some strange dreams he has had for some time about a young human male who is oddly familiar to him, even though he does not recall his name. Splinter - his butler - gently rebuilds Bruce's confidence, but the team is suddenly confronted by a strange visitor - Raphael from the Mirage reality - who tells them that Krang is messing with them all in order to weaken and finally destroy them, and they have to do something about it. At first Batman and the Turtles do not believe the \\"intruder\\", but by giving them a dimension portal activator, Mirage-Raphael provides them with the means of confirming his story. Krang has invaded both the Mirage and the DC Universes in order to fuse them into a reality which he could control at will; in order to have them out of the way, and to gloat at them over his achievement, Krang defeated the Anti-Monitor and outfitted the Technodrome with anti-matter technology (as well as turned the Anti-Monitor's corpse into a giant exo-suit for himself) and captured the Mirage-Turtles and the Pre-Crisis Batman. Pre-Crisis Batman managed to free himself and the Turtles, but in the ensuing struggle with Krang's robot troopers, only Raphael managed to escape and, after a long journey through the Turtle-Multiverse, find the mixed-up new reality.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #2 Now, Batman and the Turtles must come to terms that their world is an artificially created illusion. Batman departs for the ruined Wayne Manor, where he runs into Alfred, who is still guarding the house. As they meet, both regain the memory of their true origin, and Batman - now back to his original grim self - enters the cave below Wayne Manor to prepare for the upcoming fight. In the meantime, Mirage- Raphael suggests that the first step to right this interdimensional mess is to contact April, an assistant worker at Baxter Stockman's laboratory. However, Krang is fully aware that Mirage-Raphael is on the verge of foiling his plans, and recruits the \\"Laughing Man\\" under the pretense of giving him the means to conquer Gotham. The Smile Clan ambushes April, but the five Turtles intervene. In the course of the battle, April comes in contact with Donatello and, like Batman, regains her true memories. However, Mirage-Raphael is captured, and the Smile Clan disappears, but not before Mirage-Raphael can give his counterparts the hint that the next step to set things right is that the Smile Clan must become the Foot Clan. And so the Turtles seek out the Oroku Saki and try to convince him of his true origin. In a short time, the Shredder succeeds in reawakening the true memories of his Foot Clan soldiers and destroying the Laughing Man's operations in New Gotham, although tensions rise between him and his erstwhile allies, since Batman believes that they will need the Joker as the final piece in their plot to spoil Krang's plan, while the Shredder simply wants him dead. Meanwhile, the Laughing Man turns to Krang for aid, who gives him a Mother Box to summon his droid armies from the Technodrome, in exchange for Batman and the Turtles' demise. Later on, the Laughing Man attacks Gotham City Police Headquarters to eliminate Casey Jones, but is confronted by the Turtles and Casey, who has had his memory and gear returned to him by April just in time. After the Turtles taunt him and show him the face of his new rival, the Laughing Man retreats. Batman contacts Commissioner Gordon through a hologram, thereby restoring the latter's memories, and relates his plan to lure the Laughing Man to Ace Chemicals - the place where the Joker was \\"born\\" - in order to restore his memories. Later at Ace Chemicals, the Joker and his remaining henchmen raid the facility until the Shredder appears. When Batman intervenes, the Laughing Man throws a grenade which destroys the catwalk that he is standing on. Batman tries to save him, but the Laughing Man refuses and willingly drops himself into a tank of chemicals below. The Joker emerges as his old, twisted self again but, reveling in the idea of causing ultimate chaos, he activates Krang's Mother Box, opening a portal through which Krang's army begins to stream.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #4 In the midst of this chaotic battle, Batman wrests the Mother Box from the Joker, but a sudden vision of the death of Jason Todd makes him realize that this will not be enough to win the fight. While Batman removes himself from the scene of the battle, which is joined by the reformed Foot Clan, the IDW-Turtles go through the portal and end up in the Technodrome, where they free their Mirage-counterparts and the original Batman.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #5 In the meantime, Splinter, April and Alfred go looking for their wayward friend and find him near the activated Bat-Signal, right as Krang and his Technodrome appear in the amalgamated universe to destroy New Gotham and rebuild this reality from scratch. Just as the two Donatellos find out how to reverse the changes that Krang has made to the multiverse, the alien tyrant finds them. But before he can do anything, the Turtles activate the Mother Box, and through the portal step Batman and the allies that he has summoned: Nightwing, Batgirl, the Red Hood, Damian Wayne, and Tim Drake. As the battle rages, the damage the two teams have inflicted on Krang's dimensional amalgamation tower begins to initiate the separation of the two realities. This forces the Pre-Crisis Batman and the Mirage-Turtles to disengage from the fight and get sent home through dimensional portals, lest the universal splicing would rip them apart as well unless they are back in their native realities.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III #6 After their originals are gone, Batman initiates the detonation of Krang's tower and thus the final stage of the separation process. Krang makes a last-ditch attempt by directly bombarding Batman and the Turtles with the unleashed energy, but their newfound sense for family enables them to overcome this effect. Right after they evacuate the Technodrome via boom tubes, the Technodrome - with Krang still inside - is torn apart by the explosion. Before the Turtles, Splinter, April and Casey fade back into their reality, Batman expresses his gratitude to Splinter and his sons for having made him a part of their family. Following the complete separation of both realities, Batman invites the rest of the Bat-Family to the Batcave for a round of pizza and a day off. Spin-off =Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures= The success of the original miniseries inspired the concept for a similar crossover story, titled Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures, with Batman's DC Animated Universe incarnation encountering the Amazing Adventures comic version of the 2012 CGI series' Turtles. Author Matthew K. Manning (Beware the Batman) and artist Jon Sommariva (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Amazing Adventures) were named as participants in the project. The concept was first introduced at the San Diego Comic Con in late July 2016, and was published as a six-issue miniseries starting November 9, 2016. In this crossover, interdimensional portals open at Arkham Asylum and most of Batman's rogues gallery reach New York City and unleash their own brand of mayhem upon the Turtles. Noteworthy is the confrontation between the respective heroes‚Äô best-known enemies Shredder and The Joker; his escape from Arkham includes an in joke where he is interrupted by Harley Quinn while reading a book by M. Hamill (a reference to Joker voice actor Mark Hamill). In other media =Film= Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles On May 14, 2019, an adaptation of Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was released as a direct-to-video film by Warner Bros. Animation, under the title of Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The adaptation is based on the same events of the first volume, but the plot was rewritten after the writers redefined the Turtles as existing in the same universe as Batman. The plot therefore focuses on the two groups coming together to thwart the plans of Ra's al Ghul and the Shredder to throw Gotham into chaos through the use of mutagen combined with the Joker's Joker venom. Because of the changes in the plot, the adaptation features notable differences between it and the first miniseries: * Several characters are omitted, including Lucius Fox, Splinter, Casey Jones and April O'Neil. * Barbara Gordon/Batgirl is added in to the plot. She provides assistance to Batman, including relaying information about the theft at Powers Industrial and the sighting of the Turtles during the crime. *The Turtles and Batman share the same universe rather than different universes/realities as in the comic book miniseries, which removes said miniseries' plot point of the Turtles' desperate need to return to their own universe, as staying in the DC universe will end up killing them; because the mutagen that created them is considered an anomaly. * The Penguin attempts to steal the next item at Wayne Enterprises, but is thwarted by the Turtles. The break-in at Arkham is relayed purely by James Gordon; the Penguin plays no part in it. * As Splinter is not involved, the discovery of the Batcave is made by Donatello through research into Batman. * The battles between Leonardo and Ra's al Ghul and between Batman and the Shredder take place at Ace Chemicals; the break-in at Arkham and the fight with the mutated inmates is defined as a distraction to conceal the main villain's efforts to steal the final component and complete their plan. * The Joker does not kill Batman, but instead injects him with a dose of mutagen mixed with his Joker venom, which results in the Turtles, Robin and Batgirl attempting to cure him with an untested anti-mutagen. * The Shredder's defeat results in him falling into a vat of chemicals. The final scene, after the credits, implies he survives, but has suffered a transformation similar to that of the Joker. =Video games= Injustice 2 The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were made playable DLC characters in the DC crossover fighting game Injustice 2.

The 2015 Bangladesh student protests on \\"No VAT on Education\\" were protests by students of private universities in Bangladesh demanding the VAT imposed on higher education in private universities be eliminated. The present Finance Minister of the Bangladesh Awami League government first introduced a 10% VAT upon higher education in private universities in the draft of budget of 2015‚Äì16. Following strong opposition, the VAT was reduced to 7.5%. The imposed VAT was withdrawn by the finance division after a cabinet meeting on 14 September 2015. History Previous government tried to impose similar VAT on private university tuition fee in 2010, but had to revoke their decision as students protested strongly. Protests Private university students in Uttara,Dhaka protest VAT on tuition fees. On 22 June, law enforcement authorities foiled a procession of private university students heading for the finance ministry building to press home their demands. At the start of August 2015 the government announced they would not withdraw the VAT and that students must pay it. The news sparked outrage among students. On 9 September, police opened fire on a protest by the students of East West University. This caused outrage and immediate support for the cause by thousands of other students from different universities. On 10 September, road blockades were carried out by students from different private universities to protest the VAT on tuition fees. The protest was sparked by controversial statements by the minister of finance, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith but he stood firm on the decision for the VAT to stay. The government also issued a circular stating the VAT was only imposed on the private university authorities and the students need not pay. Incidents There were two notable incident. First one happened at Dhanmondi 27, private universities students were attacked two times in a row and the second one happened at Banani-Kakoli Square.

The powers of the Licensing Bench should be transferred to Councils. He would lease, not sell, Crown lands; he would have protective duties, as high as 25 per cent. He would reduce Civil Service salaries (except for the Customs), disallow Chinese immigration, abolish the Sunday Closing Act. He was in favor of free, secular, and compulsory education.

The restaurant was ranked as the 3rd best pizzeria in the United States after Juliana's Pizza in New York City and Pizza Time of St. Augustine in St. Augustine, Florida in 2015. History Moose's Tooth was opened by rock climbers Rod Hancock and Matt Jones in 1996 when there was a large boom in the brewpub trend happening. The location that they chose was considered to be cursed as many previous businesses failed here, but Hancock and Jones kept their optimism. Soon Moose's Tooth became one of the busiest restaurants in Anchorage. With their renowned success, the pair decided they would diversify and open a second restaurant, Bear Tooth Theatrepub, with help from Hancock's brother, Warren. The team also owns Broken Tooth Brewing which, in conjunction with Bear Tooth Theatrepub, employs over 500 people and recently purchased a large property in Spenard. The brands company names derive from three mountains in the Ruth Gorge area of Denali National Park: Moose's Tooth, Bear Tooth, and Broken Tooth respectively. Moose's Tooth is currently the highest-grossing single-unit independent pizzeria in the United States generating up to $6 million in gross revenue annually. The pizzeria is known for its Apricot pie which consists of apricot sauce, carrots, cream cheese and chicken.

It was established under the terms of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 which required every town to appoint a council (also referred to as a corporation) and a Police Watch Committee, which was responsible for overseeing a police force.  Formation and early history  One of the first constables is recorded as James Fitzsimmons, a former Irish labourer from Omagh, County Tyrone. Under collar number 2 he served the new force for thirteen years, eventually transferring to the Helston Borough Police. Fitzsimmons was said to have suffered from a significant back injury sustained in a fall from a horse, and also suffered from epilepsy.Helstonia ‚Äì The Lawmen of the Old (Cornish) West by Patrick Carroll Fitzsimmons' son Robert, became a champion boxer, and is the subject of the book \\"Lanky Bob\\" by author K.R. Robinson. The chief officer was invariably referred to as the Chief Constable, High Constable and Head Constable, although in actuality held the rank of Inspector, and later, Superintendent. From the outset the strength of the force was fourteen men, including the Head Constable George Payne. Other officers of the new force documented in official records include Constables John Rapsey, John Lowry, George Hall, Thomas Walley, William Couch, Benjamin Bawden and George Roberts.West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 18 March 1836West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 2 December 1836West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 7 April 1837West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 13 October 1837 Early in the force's history the number of officers was thought to have been too high. At a meeting of the Truro Borough Council in March 1837, representatives attempted to reduce the number of officers from fourteen to seven, and by balloting the movement was rejected. A revised suggestion would see the force reduced to nine men, also balloted and rejected. A final attempt to reduce the force to seven was also rejected, with the meeting adjourned without coming to an agreement.West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 3 March 1837 In 1846 the police took up residence at the newly constructed Town Hall on the corner of St Nicholas Street and King Street, sharing the building with the magistrates, stannary courts and the fire brigade. Petty and Quarter Sessions were held at the building, with the Chief Constable responsible for presenting cases to the courts. By the 1850s the Truro Borough Council had its way and had reduced the number of serving officers by less than half the original strength. Subsequently the force was consistently criticised in successive inspections by the Inspector of Constabulary, with the earliest recorded report in 1858. The report recommended the addition of four extra officers to serve a population of 10,733 and a 1,103-acre beat. The corporation rejected the recommendation, however, when they pointed out that given the town was largely pastoral land there was no requirement to fund extra police officers, and that the Inspector of Constabulary was \\"sorely mistaken\\" in his estimations.\\"Truro Town Council\\" Royal Cornwall Gazette 13 August 1858 On 23 September 1873 the force was inspected by the Inspector of Constabulary Captain Willis, who examined the force's uniforms, books, cells and expressed himself \\"much satisfied,\\" although would again point out that force was understaffed, and would be eligible for a government grant.\\"Inspection of Police\\" West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 23 September 1873 In April 1874 the corporation of Truro was informed that the government would be subsidising approximately fifty per cent of the police force's budget. Previously the population of the town had funded the police in entirety via the local police rate, and in response to the new funding the corporation recommended an increase in manpower.\\"Local Intelligence ‚Äì Truro\\" West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 23 April 1874 In May 1876, the strength of the Truro Borough Police force was once again criticised for being \\"inefficient\\" owing to only six officers serving a population of 11,000. The government recommended a minimum of twelve for the borough, which by 1878 was achieved.\\"Notes by the Way\\" Royal Cornwall Gazette 6 May 1876  Chief constables  The first Chief Constable was George Payne, appointed in 1836.\\"Truro Industries Past & Present\\" Royal Cornwall Gazette 13 March 1890 Payne is notable for collaborating with a Mr Davis, then station-master for Newham Railway Station, in inventing a type of smokeless gunpowder. Work on the powder was abandoned however when detractors spoke out about the product permitting game to be \\"killed by poachers with impunity.\\" On 12 August 1882, Payne, who was by this time retired from the police and working at Newham Railway Station as a nightwatchman, was brutally assaulted by a male known as \\"Doctor Dick.\\" Doctor Dick was later apprehended in Cardiff and sentenced to ten years in prison.\\"Retirement of the Truro Police Superintendent\\" Royal Cornwall Gazette 7 December 1893 Upon Payne's retirement the force was led by William John Nash, and later William Woolcock from 1865 to 1872. In 1873 Richard Angel was sworn in as the new Chief Constable and led the force for 21 years, retiring in 1894. His service is notable for the low crime rate observed under his leadership, with no cases of murder or manslaughter recorded in two decades. Moreover, he would oversee the closure of a number of undesirable public houses in Truro. Angel would also increase the number of regular officers from six in 1873 to twelve in 1878. Angel was succeeded by former Oldham Borough Police officer Inspector Edwin F. Winch who served until 1897.\\"The New Superintendent of Truro Police\\" Royal Cornwall Gazette 15 February 1894 On his departure Angel was awarded a gift by Winch of an ornamental metal water jug bearing the inscription \\"presented to Chief Superintendent Angel by the members of the Truro City Police Force, on retiring on superannuation, 1894, as a mark of their regard and best wishes for his future welfare.\\" Winch was succeeded by a Mr Coleman, who resigned in 1901 to lead the Lincolnshire Constabulary, with Truro City Police Sergeant Frank Pearce taking the post of Chief Constable until 1920.\\"Truro\\" Cornishman 3 October 1901 Chief Constables of the era also held the role of Inspectors of Weights & Measures, which was true for Woolcock, Angel, Winch and Pearce, with some civilian members of the corporation taking on the role invariably or concurrently with the Chief Constable.Cornwall Police Boroughs History  Special Constabulary  To support the regular police during the First World War, a large number of Special Constables were employed. In February 1915, approximately fifty-seven members of the community, including members of the clergy, attended the Town Hall and were sworn in by the Mayor Mr J.J. Smith.\\"Special Constables for Truro\\" West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 25 February 1915  Rebranding  In 1877 the borough of Truro was granted city status by Queen Victoria, and the police force was accordingly renamed Truro City Police. The change also prompted the force to adopt a new style of uniform, which included the wearing of Metropolitan Police-styled duty armbands, and the use of the rank of Chief Constable for the chief officer. Sergeant uniforms would also feature the traditional chevrons on the upper arm as opposed to the cuff as before, and would wear chrome cap badges in comparison to the black worn by Constables. The force was known for its uniform peculiarities, such as the fixing of the whistle chain to the right breast pocket instead of the left.\\"Truro City Police\\" Policing the Peninsula by Simon Dell  First World War  A small group of regular police officers resigned their posts in 1914 and went to war, and it is unknown whether any were killed in action. They were constables Balment, Benney, Lindesay and Moon. In 1920 an unidentified former officer of the force was criticised by Councillor J. Tonkin for requesting preferential treatment from the Mayor and Chief Constable. It was alleged that this former officer attempted to secure his job with the police, and an immediate promotion to Sergeant, through insidious means, and entirely expected his job to remain open to him on his return. Had he been granted re-employment with the police, it would have meant the supersession of another Sergeant who had reached the rank through normal means.\\"Criticism of Truro City Police\\" West Briton & Cornwall Advertiser 23 December 1920  Abolition  In March 1921 the force amalgamated with the Cornwall Constabulary. Resistance to the merger was reported in the media, with the main reason being \\"sentiment,\\" however it was also noted that amalgamation would save \\"4d in the ¬£ to the rates.\\"\\"County Administration\\" Western Morning News 4 January 1921 Prior to the merger, Chief Constable Pearce retired due to ill health leaving the post vacant.\\"Truro\\" Cornishman 26 January 1921 References Category:Defunct police forces of the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in Cornwall Category:Truro Category:Crime in Cornwall Category:1836 establishments in England Category:1921 disestablishments in England ","title":"Truro City Police"},{"id":"47775814","text":"On 5 January 1970, a Convair 990 Coronado operated by the Spanish airline Spantax crashed shortly after take-off from Stockholm Arlanda Airport, killing five of the ten people on board. Background The aircraft was earlier that evening about to fly to Mallorca with Swedish travelers, but at take-off the number 4 engine developed a fault. The take-off was aborted and the aircraft returned to the gate and the passengers were allowed to leave the aircraft. Later in the evening it was decided to perform a three-engine ferry flight to Z√ºrich for an engine-change. On board were three crew members and seven passengers. There was a strong wind and -27 ¬∞C at the airport. Accident At 22:24 hours the aircraft started its take-off roll on runway 19. During the take-off roll, the nose yawed to the right. This was corrected by retarding number 1 engine power from 85% to 80-60%. The aircraft rotated at 134 knots with 27 degrees flaps. While climbing, the aircraft banked 4-6 degrees to the right and the airspeed suddenly dropped to 10 knots below V2 (145 knots). The aircraft contacted some treetops, banked 10-15 degrees and crashed 1,800 meters from the point of lift-off. The plane ploughed a long road in the woods and broke into several pieces. The cockpit was separated from the rest of the fuselage and was wedged between tree trunks and hard frozen ground and tilted 45 degrees to the left. First officer Miguel Granado was sitting to the right and became trapped when the seat pushed forward and both legs were caught up under the instrument panel. His right lower leg was broken and angled. His left foot was tightly pinched as well as left calf and the achilles tendon. Askew under the pilot was one of the aircraft maintenance engineers, trapped with multiple rib fractures. Granado held, without gloves, his hands on one of the fuselage pipes and tried to keep himself up and thereby relieve pressure on his friend's chest. Both hands received severe frostbite. The captain escaped with minor contusions and was able to break free and get out. Aware of the risk of being motionless at these low temperatures, he walked around and tried to keep the body heat up and thereby escaped with minor frostbite on the hands and feet. They searched in the prevailing darkness and powder snow for the Emergency Locator Transmitter and could, after it was found, call for help. What the crew did not know was that there was a house where a family, asleep and oblivious to the accident, only a hundred meters from the crash site. The family later woke up when a police helicopter flew low over their house. Emergency response Four hours after the accident the emergency response located the plane. First officer Granado who was trapped, had to wait over eight hours in the bitter cold before he was free. At the time of the accident, disaster preparedness at Arlanda was minimal. An ambulance was stationed at L√∂wenstr√∂mska lasarettet in Upplands V√§sby 10 km south, but had no radio installed. Staff were sent out in white robes, and clogs on their feet to help the survivors. Five people, including a Swedish flight attendant, died in the cold weather. Investigation The Swedish Accident Investigation Authority summarized the interacting factors of the accident: *Unexpected early loss of external visual reference after take-off. *Loss of directional control during transition from visual to instrument flying. The yaw created increased drag and yaw induced roll. *The presence of a temperature inversion, which resulted in a down draught and speed loss. *Presence of wind shear, which caused additional speed loss. The group within the Swedish Accident Investigation Authority that investigated the emergency response pointed out certain deficiencies in the search and rescue systems, which later resulted in a reorganization. Aftermath The Spantax accident was one of the events that caused the Swedish health care to develop both the disaster medical preparedness and equipment. They also began to set up emergency plans.

Background On 1 May 1941, forces loyal to Rashid Ali occupied the fort at Rutbah. An advanced party from Habforce was dispatched to combat them. Conflict On 8 May 1941, a column of the Arab Legion, under Glubb Pasha, reached the fort at Rutbah. They picketed the ground surrounding the fort, to wait for the impending Royal Air Force bombardment. The fort was defended by approximately 100 policemen, the majority of which were Iraqi Desert Police.de Chair, p. 18 The H4-based Blenheims of No. 203 Squadron RAF arrived and bombed the fort, and thinking that the fort had surrendered, left. The fort did not surrender and the RAF returned twice that day to bomb the fort without success. The next day, the RAF continued to bomb the fort at intermittent intervals. One plane sustained such heavy small-arms fire that it crashed on the way back to the airfield, killing the pilot. That evening, 40 trucks armed with machine guns arrived at the fort to reinforce the garrison. Half of the trucks were irregulars under the command of Fawzi al-Qawuqji and the other half were Iraqi Desert Police. Glubb decided to withdraw his soldiers back to H3 to await the reinforcement of the main column. The Arab Legion arrived back at H3 on the morning of 10 May, and found No. 2 Armoured Car Company RAF under Squadron Leader Michael Casano waiting there. The squadron had been sent up ahead of the main column to assist the Arab Legion in taking Rutbah. Casano took his armoured cars to Rutbah whilst the Arab Legion replenished their supplies at H3. Casano's armoured cars fought an action against al-Qawuqji's trucks for most of the rest of the day, and although the result was not decisive the trucks retired to the east under the cover of dark to leave the garrison to its fate. That night the RAF succeeded in a night bombing, with several bombs landing inside the fort. Following the withdrawal of al- Qawuqji's trucks and the successful bombing by the RAF, the garrison withdrew from the fort under the cover of dark.

Two of them are modest 1-1/2 story log houses, finished with board-and-batten siding, and the third is a two-story wood-frame dairy barn. These were built 1936-39 pursuant to a plan by Dr. William Anderson Hudson, a doctor with deep family ties in the area, to provide facilities for tuberculosis sufferers in the remote area. His plans were frustrated by World War II and state regulations on such facilities, and the main sanitarium was never built.

The work of the organization has been mentioned in major media outlets such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. History A group of pastors and professors in Ithaca, NY came together to form Chesterton House in 2000 in order to \\"facilitate discovery of the intellectual riches of the historic Christian faith, thereby empowering more faithful Christian living.\\" The Study Center is named after G.K. Chesterton, the British writer and humorist who influenced Gandhi and C.S. Lewis. According to their 2014 Annual Report, Chesterton House describes its residential community as \\"a cross between a fraternity and a monastery.\\" They have an annual budget of over $500,000, 60% of which is donated. The remainder comes from program service revenue and special fundraisers, such as when the center issued a jazz CD featuring William Edgar and John Patitucci. The Chesterton House residential living-learning community is situated on a two- acre property within walking distance of the Cornell campus. It consists of three structures‚Äîan English Tudor-style mansion that formerly served as a Greek house, a second large home formerly owned by Allan H. Treman, and a cottage. In addition to providing housing for over 30 students, the facilities include large common areas‚Äîliving rooms, dining rooms, industrial kitchens, sunrooms, and libraries‚Äîas well as views of downtown Ithaca and Cayuga Lake. Chesterton House building on The Knoll. The Founder and former Executive Director Karl E. Johnson, also a founding member and current board chair of the Consortium of Christian Study Centers (CCSC), said in the Cornell Chronicle,\\"[W]e want to communicate that a proper study and understanding of religion helps facilitate human flourishing in all areas of life, whether in the arts, public policy, or the modern research university.\\" Dick Keyes of L‚ÄôAbri speaks of Chesterton House as a place where ideas are \\"argued, debated, persuaded, reasoned.\\" Chesterton House is an affiliate member of Cornell United Religious Work, which organizes all religious groups on Cornell's campus, including Cornell Hillel and the Cornell Catholic Community. Chesterton House's advisory board includes Ken Blanchard, Andy Crouch formerly of Christianity Today, D.A. Carson, Elaine Howard Ecklund, Ard Louis, and Eleonore Stump. There is also a Governing Board and a Faculty Advisory Board. In 2013 twenty-one university campus ministry organizations were awarded $2.9 million from the Lilly Endowment in order to further their vocation-related programs. Chesterton House was one of the four Christian Study Centers to receive the grant, including Hill House Ministries at the University of Texas at Austin, the Center for Christian Study at the University of Virginia, and the Christian Study Center of Gainesville at the University of Florida. The Oread Center in Kansas, also a member of the Consortium of Christian Study Centers, received part of a $4 million grant in 2014. Programs Author Andy Crouch at Chesterton House. All programs are categorized into three groups: events, residential, and courses. Since 2000, as part of their \\"partnership model of ministry,\\" Chesterton House co-sponsors events with academic departments, many local churches, and over a dozen campus ministries, including Chinese Bible Study, Cru, FCA, Navigators, InterVarsity, as well as Graduate Christian Fellowship and the graduate student fellowships at the Cornell Law School and the Johnson Graduate School of Management. Chesterton House regularly hosts public lectures on topics such as art, culture, economics, faith and science, food security, human trafficking, race, technology, and theology. The organization's Beimfohr-Neuss Lecture Series, which addresses issues pertaining to faith in a pluralistic society, has been delivered by Dr. Junius Johnson, Dr. Warren Kinghorn, Dr. Mia Chung, Dr. C. Jimmy Lin, Joel Salatin, Dr. Felicia Wu Song, and Richard Stearns. Other past speakers include Makoto Fujimura, Lisa Sharon Harper, Philip Jenkins, Robin Jensen, Richard Mouw, Mark Noll, Alvin Plantinga, Cornelius Plantinga, Sir John Polkinghorne, Eleonore Stump, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Dr. Jeremy Begbie.. In 2010 Chesterton House established \\"residential living learning centers\\" in which dozens of men and women participate each year. This includes a Sunday night weekly meal, cooking, cleaning, regular prayer and Scripture reading, daily devotions, an annual retreat, and semester service projects. In 2014, in conjunction with Gordon College, Chesterton House began offering courses for credit in biblical studies. Past courses include studies of the book of Mark, hermeneutics, the book of Proverbs, the book of Job, the Old Testament, happiness, desires, and vocation. Other regular events at Chesterton House and other Christian Study Centers include retreats, conferences, discussion groups, and film viewings. Chesterton House staff advise several student organizations, including Cornell Claritas, a journal, and student chapters of Christian Legal Society, International Justice Mission, and Veritas Forum.

Isolation  H. gaghwensis was first characterized from isolates obtained from the Ganghwen Island off of the coast of South Korea. It was discovered in 2005 while South Korean researchers were conducting studies of diversity for the known species, H. chejuensis. They determined through 16S rRNA sequencing that a strain, FR1050, was distinct enough from model H. chejuensis rRNA to warrant description as a separate species, and further research showed various biochemical and physiological differences  Metabolism  Notable for the aerobic microbe is the ability of H. ganghwensis to produce an overabundance of extracellular polysaccharides. Though it is incapable of nitrate reduction, it does favor N-acetylglucosamine for growth. It does not grow in the presence of nitrate, adipate, gluconate, or caprate  Phylogeny  Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, the closest relatives were H. chejuensis strain KCTC 2396T (94.7%), Zooshikella ganghwensis strain JC2044T (90.1%) and Microbulbifer hydrolyticus strain DSM 11525T (90.7%).

He spent most of his adult life working in the school systems, first as a school teacher and ending with work at Northeastern University until his death in 1992. O'Bryant was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He also served in the United States Army before he began his teaching career. The John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics & Science in Boston is named for him, as is the John D. O'Bryant Center for African American Studies at Northeastern University.  Early life and education  O'Bryant was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 15, 1931. He was born to David D. O'Bryant and Elsie (Donaldson) O'Bryant Joseph. He was the youngest of five children. His father David died when he was young and was raised by his mother, Elsie, and stepfather George E. Joseph. O'Bryant attended the Boston Public Schools and graduated from The English High School in 1948. After high school, he attended Boston University, in Boston, Massachusetts, where he also played basketball. He played basketball through his undergraduate and captained the team at Boston University and received a bachelor's degree in Education in 1952. He continued his education and received a master's degree in health education in 1955. While obtaining his masters, O'Bryant served in the United States Army from 1952 until 1954, where he worked as an information and education instructor Career After exiting the Army, O'Bryant continued working his love for education and became a teacher in 1955 for the Boston Public Schools. In the Boston Public Schools, he was also a guidance counselor at Boston Technical High School until 1969. He was passionate about basketball and wanted to be a head coach in the Boston schools, but racial attitudes of the 1960s prohibited this. O'Bryant left his position as a guidance counselor in 1969 to transition into a director role for the Health Vocational Training Program at the Dimock Community Health Center based in Roxbury, Massachusetts. He directed paramedical training programs for students in all areas of Boston. He held this position from 1969 to 1978 before taking on his role at Northeastern University. In O'Bryant's first year at Northeastern in 1978, he was the Associate Dean of Administration before becoming the vice president of student affairs. In 1979 Kenneth G. Ryder, president of Northeastern, appointed O'Bryant as Vice President of Student Affairs. The two had met while serving on the Citywide Coordinating Council. O'Bryant helped welcome more African Americans to the Northeastern community. =Boston School Committee= In 1977 O'Bryant became the first African American to be elected to the Boston School Committee in 75 years. While he was the president of the school committee he was also serving as the national chairman of the Council of Urban School Boards of Education of the National School Boards Association. Before running for the school committee, he helped run the campaign for Mel King in 1959 and 1961. King suggested O'Bryant run for the committee in upcoming races because of his ideas and opinions. Even though King did not win those elections he helped pave the way for another African American to earn a place on the committee.

In 1998, Grimaldi retired and sold the Grimaldi's brand name and franchise to Frank Ciolli. Several years later, Ciolli moved Grimaldi's Pizzeria to a larger building next door. In 2011, Grimaldi announced he was coming out of retirement at the age of 80, but was unable to open a restaurant in his own name due to selling his brand rights.

Rutherford was Liberal candidate at the 1928 Aberdeen North by-election. This was not a promising seat; there had been no Liberal candidate at the previous general election, the last Liberal candidate came third and a Liberal had not won since 1910. On top of that, the Labour candidate seeking to hold the seat was former Liberal MP, William Wedgwood Benn. He finished fourth, behind the Communist candidate. He was then Liberal candidate for the Kilmarnock division of Ayrshire at the 1929 General Election. This was a Unionist/Labour marginal seat. No Liberal had stood in 1924 but one had come second in 1923. He polled just over 21% of the vote and came third. Within a few months there was a by-election but Rutherford declined an invitation to stand. He did not stand for parliament again.British parliamentary election results 1918‚Äì1949, Craig, F.W.S.

She is best known for her work in Wrestling with Shadows (1998), The Famine Within (1990), The Spring and Fall of Nina Polanski (1974) and the TV series The Newsroom. Hutton was the first female president of the Canadian society of Cinematographers and the first women to be given the ability to place 'csc' after her name, which represents being a full member. Early life and education Joan Hutton was born and raised in southern Ontario's Toronto area. She attended W. Tresper Clarke High School in Orono, ON, graduating in 1965 and then went on to begin her secondary education with studying commercial photography. Later Hutton enrolled in film studies at Toronto's Ryerson Polytechnical Institute, graduating in 1974. After studying at Ryerson, Hutton began working as a camera assistant where she discovered her interest in cinematography.  Career  In 1974, Joan Hutton joined the Canadian Society of Cinematographers as an affiliate member. In 1980, Hutton founded a production company called High Road Productions with Paul Jay. During Hutton's time here, she did work for CBC, TVOntario, CTV and the Discovery Channel. High Road Productions was a milestone in Hutton's career because it allowed her to gain experience in the field of cinematography shortly after school. After years as Vice-President of the firm Hutton stepped away to pursue other opportunities. In the years to follow Hutton worked on many different projects in the industry, she shot films, documentaries and TV. Hutton started in the film industry as a camera assistant, then became a camera operator, and then later a director of photography (also known as a cinematographer). In 1991, Hutton became president of the Canadian Society of Cinematographers, where she eventually was awarded CSC in 1994. She remained president of CSC until 2014, she remains Editor in Chief of the CSC magazine Canadian Cinematographer. = The Newsroom = The Newsroom is a TV comedy- drama that aired for 3 seasons on CBC in 1996‚Äì97, 2003‚Äì04 and 2004‚Äì05, and was followed by a two-hour TV movie called Escape From The Newsroom in 2002. Hutton's work in this show depicts a \\"naturalist\\" style, where she uses long takes and a handheld camera to avoid appearing like a typical TV drama, where everything is evidently staged. Throughout the filming of the series, Hutton often had to figure out her framing as she filmed, but she made sure that her lighting was on point by ensuring lighting mechanisms were hidden, yet the light was visible for shots and characters. She also used a handheld 12V Kino Flo fixture behind the camera, it was used to provide light no matter where the action took her and the camera. Hutton used a digital betacam to film the show and although she made sure there was always proper lighting, she didn't want there to be too much light, which would make the show appear unnatural. Filmography Hutton holds over 36 credits in various films.

Measuring in at 4mm, the Smart Keyboard does not include external wires or Bluetooth, and does not contain batteries that would need to be charged. Instead, it is powered by the magnetic Smart Connector, a new port that is found on the iPad Pro, and recent iPad and iPad Air models.Compared: Magic Keyboard versus Smart Keyboard Folio by Andrew O'Hara, AppleInsider. 2020-04-23. The Smart Keyboard received positive reviews, but was criticized for its high price. In November 2018, it was superseded by the Smart Keyboard Folio for the 3rd generation iPad Pro.

Boudet's father was the manager of the forges of Quillan who had been authorized (1837)\\"Bulletin des lois de la R√©publique francÃúaise, Num√©ros 297 √† 337\\", Bulletin des lois du Royaume de France, r√©gne de Louis-Philippe, Roi des Fran√ßais, Ordonnance du Roi portant autorisation de la soci√©t√© anonyme des Forges et Usines d'Axat (Aude), Au Palais de Saint- Cloud, le 19 Septembre 1837 by Fran√ßois-Denis-Henry-Albert, Count de La Rochefoucauld-Bayers (1799‚Äì1854), a member of a prominent French aristocratic family, the De la Rochefoucault to act as his sole representative to constitute a joint venture, la societ√© des forges et fonderies d'Axat, a Forge and casting plant, the partnership was also composed of controlling shareholder, Ange-Jean-Michel-Bonaventure (1767‚Äì1847), 4th Marquess of Dax d'Axat, once Mayor of Montpellier and his son Barth√©l√©my-L√©on-Fran√ßois-Xav√Æer de Dax. Nothing is known about Boudet's early years following his father death and how his family managed to survive financially is not documented either; G√©rard de S√®de claimed ‚Äì without citing any evidence ‚Äì that Boudet entered holy orders through the patronage of Abb√© Emile-Francois-Henri G√©raud de Cayron (1807‚Äì1897).G√©rard de S√®de, L'Or de Rennes, page 138 (Ren√© Julliard, 1967). After completing his seminary studies in Carcassonne, where he also earned his degree in English language and literature, Boudet was ordained to the priesthood on Christmas Day 1861,R√©my Cazals, Daniel Fabre, Les Audois Dictionnaire biographique, p.74, Association des Amis des Archives de l'Aude, F√©d√©ration Audoise des Oeuvres La√Øques, Soci√©t√© d'√©tudes scientifiques de l'Aude, Carcassonne, (1990). he spent the first year of his priesthood in Durban-Corbi√®res until 16 June 1862 when he was assigned to Caunes-Minervois up to 30 October 1866. On 1 November 1866, Boudet was appointed parish priest of Festes-et-Saint-Andr√©, next to the town of Limoux. In 1872, Boudet was transferred to Rennes-les-Bains (succeeding L'abb√© Jean Vi√© who had died a short time earlier) until 1914 when he was discharged from his duty by the Bishop of Carcassonne, Mgr Paul-F√©lix Beuvain de Beaus√©jour (1839‚Äì1930), due to serious illness. Boudet lived in Rennes-les-Bains with his mother and sister Jeanne, both died the same year in 1896. Henri Boudet spent the rest of his days in Axat, where his younger brother Edmond (Jean-Baptiste-Edmond), who died on 5 May 1907, once worked as a notary. The two Boudet brothers are buried in the same grave. It features two epitaph inscriptions, engraved horizontally and on the lower part of the gravestone, a small rectangular shaped figure on its surface, engraved vertically with the following inscription ŒôŒßŒüŒ•Œ£ which stand for Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour. The name of Henri Boudet's successor was published in the regional Catholic periodical Semaine Religieuse de Carcassonne of 2 May 1914. Abb√© Joseph Rescani√®res died suddenly at the age of 37 on 1 February 1915 from a suspected heart attack. A final tribute to Boudet's character was published in the same periodical mentioned above on 10 April 1915. =Boudet's interests and La Vraie langue celtique= Beside his priestly responsibilities, Boudet's interests extended to the fields of local history, archaeology, toponymy, linguistics and photography. He was made a member of the following learned societies, the Soci√©t√© des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne (1888)http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4865901/f6.item.r=boudet and of the Soci√©t√© de Linguistique de Paris (1897). In the preface to his 1886 book, La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains, Boudet stated that his \\"cromleck\\" was \\"intimately linked to the resurrection\\" (trouve intimement li√© √† la r√©surrection) and in turn cognate to the revival of the Celtic language (ou, si l'on veut, au r√©veil inattendu de la langue celtique) and therefore to his etymological arguments.\\"C'est ainsi que le Cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains se trouve intimement li√© √† la r√©surrection, ou, si l'on veut, au r√©veil inattendu de la langue celtique\\" (\\"Thus the Cromleck of Rennes-les- Bains is intimately linked to the resurrection, or, if you will, the unexpected revival of the Celtic language\\"). Avant-Propos, La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains, 1886. The first five of the eight chapters in Boudet's 1886 book consists of an argument that ancient languages such as Basque, Celtic, Punic and Hebrew are derived from a more ancient mother language that was identical to Modern English. For example, when Boudet referred to the location known as The Reals√®s (today called \\"la Realsesse\\") he claimed it was derived from two English words: real (i.e., effective), and cess (tax),Putnam and Wood, page 234. when commenting how \\"The Reals√®s runs in a valley whose fertile earth enables the inhabitants to pay their taxes and where the Celts till their ground for easy produce\\".Boudet, La Vraie langue celtique, page 227. The search for a mother language from which all other languages were derived was nothing new and Henri Boudet was not the first author to make such a proposition.Umberto Eco, The Search for the Perfect Language (Oxford: Blackwell's, UK; Cambridge, Mass., USA, 1997).The French Catholic esoterist Paul Le Cour (1871‚Äì1954) gave a potted history of the search for a primitive language in his article The French Revolution and the searchers for Atlantis (reprinted in Atlantis Number 356, pages 109-130, Winter 1989), where he cited as examples Charles de Brosses, Trait√© de la formation mecanique des langues et des principes physiques de l'etymologie (1765) and Antoine Court de G√©belin, Monde primitif (9 volumes, 1773). The article was originally entitled The 18th Century and The Primitive World and was published in Atlantis Number 46, March‚ÄìApril 1933.The book by Godfrey Higgins, Anacalypsis, was posthumously published in 1836, part of which read: \\"the megalithic remains scattered across the world had been the works of a great nation unknown to history, which had discovered religion and writing\\" (cited by Ronald Hutton, in The Triumph of the Moon, page 18, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, 1999). Philippe Schrauben, in his introduction to the 1984 re-published edition of Boudet's book, commented: \\"...we notice that La Vraie langue celtique... is a huge mosaic of extracts of 19th-century works carefully chosen to make them more or less coherent. There are not only detailed quotations but whole pages transcribed word for word and put end to end.\\" Schrauben considered that to understand Boudet's book one would have to research his sources and read them in the context of their time.Philippe Schrauben introduction in, Henri Boudet, La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains (√âditions Belisane, Cazilhac, 1984; ).Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau: A Mystery Solved, page 237 (2005 edition).Article: La Vraie Lanque Celtique, pages 649-650, in, Patrick Berlier, Daniel Dug√®s, Christian Doumergue, etc, editors, L'ABC de RLC: l'Encyclop√©die de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau (Arqa √©ditions, 2009). Boudet also made historical claims, like for example that the Tectosages (mainly known about from Strabo, that he called \\"Volkes Tectosages\\"), were early inhabitants of the Aude and the ancestors of the Saxons and the Franks, therefore of the English and the French.Henri Boudet, La Vraie langue celtique, pages 12-17. Chapters six to eight of Boudet's book consisted of an analysis and mapping of the geological structures surrounding Rennes-les-Bains, whereby he confused isolated large stone blocks, put in place by nature (some marked with naturally-formed Greek crosses, caused by water erosion, as testified by Gibert and Rancoule in 1969 and by othersQuoting Urbain Gibert and Guy Rancoule, \\"...even if the descriptions of the sites given by Abb√© BOUDET are accurate and precise, the conclusions he reaches as an expert on the Celtic languages (insofar as he would have been regarded as such a hundred years ago) unfortunately show signs of an over-active imagination, as can readily be confirmed by perusing his work. His attributions to prehistoric or protohistoric civilisations of 'menhirs, dolmens and cromlechs' which he describes and plots on a map that is otherwise geographically exact, are not based on solid evidence. We have established that, in every case, he was dealing with mere erosion-phenomena on a naturally rock ridge. The same can be said of the numerous crosses and cup shapes which we have seen and which can be ascribed to the same causes\\" in, Rennes-les-Bains: note sur un t√™te sculpt√©e (Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Scientifiques de l‚ÄôAude, page 147, Tome LXIX, 1969).\\"...pure speculation on the part of the Abb√©, as the megaliths discussed are all, without exception, part of the natural rock-formations\\": Article: Henri Boudet, in, Patrick Berlier, Daniel Dug√®s, Christian Doumergue, etc, editors, L'ABC de RLC: l'Encyclop√©die de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, page 79 (Arqa √©ditions, 2009).), with menhirs and listed them as part of his vast cromlech (Boudet intended to call his tour of the mountain ridges in the area of Rennes-les-Bains with this word), with the inclusion of a secondary stone circle,Henri Boudet, La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les- Bains, (Imprimerie, Fran√ßois Pomi√®s, 1886) that was ridiculed by scholars.Quoting Germain Sicard, \\"on page 245 [in Boudet's book], after the description of an alleged 'dolmen' which is actually the accidental product of a rockfall the author tells us that, immediately above this 'dolmen', is a rock located on the ridge and that this rock has a Greek Cross carved into it (that scholars consider to be naturally formed). Boudet says that it is the largest of all the crosses of this kind known to him. By bringing these facts to the attention of our learned colleagues in Rennes-les-Bains it will be possible for them to check the accuracy of the statements in Boudet‚Äôs book, and to perhaps identify certain errors attributable to the author‚Äôs vivid imagination and to his lack of knowledge of modern prehistorical research\\", in Note sur les Croix Rupestres des Corbi√®res (Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Scientifiques de l‚ÄôAude, page 372, Tome XXXVII, 1928). Sicard was a founder member of the Soci√©t√© d'Etudes Scientifiques de l‚ÄôAude and vice-president of la Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise d'Arch√©ologie =Boudet's 'cromleck': a tour= Boudet described his \\"cromleck\\" in chapter seven of his book, which in essence was a circular tour of the mountain ridges around Rennes-les-Bains: the area in question is illustrated by a map that was drawn by his brother, Edmond (who also did the drawings in the book). It was claimed that this tour, the cromleck, marked out a drunemeton, a central meeting point of the Tectosages. According to Boudet, the word dru-neme-ton was derived from the now obsolete English word trow (meaning to think or believe), and name. Boudet claimed this represented the place in society where ancient sages gathered together (that Boudet called the Neimheid) to think up names for the places they lived in, \\"to carry out their scientific functions and make up the particular or general nomenclature\\".Boudet, La vraie langue celtique, pages 225-226. Bill Putnam summarized Boudet's central argument: the drunemeton was a \\"special place where the tribal dignitaries came together to invent these incredible names based on words from a language that had not yet come into existence.\\"Putnam and Wood, page 234 (2005). =Reactions to La Vraie langue celtique= The book, written with Apologetics intention, didn't go unnoticed at the time of its first publication. An enthusiastic article on his book was published in the French regional Newspaper Le Courrier de l'Aude of 18 December 1866,Courrier de l'Aude 18 decembre 1886 , page 3 (33me Ann√©e, N¬∞ 3994). praising his pioneer work, followed shortly afterwards by a severely negative review, given by lawyer and historian Gaston Jourdanne (1858‚Äì1905), published in the French Newspaper Le Radical du Midi of 26 May 1887 that questioned the seriousness of Boudet's self-satisfied book. The same year, Boudet's book was among the ten worksRevue critique d'histoire et de litt√©rature, Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, s√©ance du 14 janvier 1887, p 76, Paris, 1887 selected for the prix Gobert, a prestigious prize (awarded to the most learning and detailed research concerning French history), distributed by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres but the prize was awarded to French historian and essayist Alphonse de RubleAnnuaire-bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de France, Tome XXIV, p 164, Paris, 1887 (1834-1898) for his works entitled Le Mariage de Jeanne d'Albret and Antoine de Bourbon et Jeanne d'Albret. Boudet made an unsuccessful attempt to have his book honoured by the award of the m√©daille d'or, a prize (the awardee received a sum of money) distributed by the Acad√©mie des sciences, inscriptions et belles-lettres de Toulouse.http://academie-sciences-lettres- toulouse.frhttp://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5746710f/f701.image\\"M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, inscriptions et belles-lettres de Toulouse\\", p.648, Huiti√®me s√©rie-Tome IX, Imprimerie Douloudure-Privat, Toulouse, (1887). Also cited in Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du tr√©sor de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, pages 284-285 (1985). M. Eug√®ne Lapierre (1834-1923), speaking on behalf of the l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, commented about Boudet's book on 5 June 1887: \\"We cannot enter into a detailed criticism of this book in order to discuss all its whimsical assumptions and assertions, which are as gratuitous as they are audacious, and which seem to suggest that the author has a very fertile imagination. Adopting an exclusively religious viewpoint, the author has made unceasing use of authorities which have nothing to do with linguistics as it is nowadays constituted, such as the Bible, Latin authors, de Maistre, Chateaubriand, Figuier etc. We were not unsurprised to learn that the Punic language, which was spoken before Babel, was actually modern English, and was preserved by the Tectosages. This is what Monsieur Boudet has tried to prove to us by extraordinarily ingenious etymological feats. The Academy, while recognizing that an amount of work has gone into this volume which does deserve some respect, does not believe that it has a duty to set its seal of approval, by awarding a prize, on a system of historical reconstruction that is as bold as it is novel'.\\" A brief notice on Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian specialist √âmile Cartailhac, a member of the Soci√©t√© d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude and of the Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du Midi de la France was published in 1892 in the Revue des Pyren√©es.√âmile Cartailhac, Bibliographie Pyr√©n√©enne et M√©ridionale: Bulletin de la commission arch√©ologique et litt√©raire de l'arrondissement de Narbonne, pages 167-168 (Revue des Pyren√©es et de la France m√©ridionale, tome IV, premier fascicule, Toulouse, 1892) Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of the ridiculous book La Vrai langue celtique. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introductionGaston Jourdanne, De quelques √©tymologies celtiques, \\"Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√©tudes scientifiques de l'Aude\\", quatri√©me ann√©e, tome IV, p.LVI and pp.145-47, Carcassonne (1893). of Boudet's book to the Soci√©t√© d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism went so far as to say that Boudet's study was worthy at most of publication in the British satirical magazine Punch. Jourdanne's criticism of Boudet's book represented only one out of many.Pierre Jarnac gave a list of criticisms of Boudet's book in his Histoire du Tr√©sor de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, pages 278-296. (L‚ÄôAssociation pour le d√©veloppement de la lecture, 1985) Boudet's Celtic theory was utilized on at least one occasion. One of his colleagues, Abb√© Raymond Anc√© of Greffeil, Aude, who was also interested in archaeology and who was unhappy with the etymology of \\"Greffeil\\" derived from the Latin word, Agrifolium (meaning Holly), asked Boudet for his personal view on the matter.M. Charles Dat de St-Foulc, Une Excursion A Greffeil Dans les Corbi√®res, page 121 (Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes Scientifiques de l'Aude, Tome II, 1891). Boudet claimed that the etymology of \\"Greffeil\\" was derived from Grev-fill, meaning Full (plenty) and Grev (grave) translated as a place full of graves. Abb√© Anc√© then conducted an excavation in a part of his town and discovered some ancient graves possibly dating back to Neolithic times, as well as some artifacts (that were donated to the Museum of Carcassonne). Anc√©'s archeological discoveries were published in the French newspaper, Le Courrier de l'Aude and drew the attention of none other than Charles Dat de St-Foulc, the Honorary President of the Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. St-Foulc with the archaeologist Germain Sicard went to Greffeil to see Anc√©'s discoveries for themselves. A report about Abb√© Anc√©'s archaeological discoveries by Charles Dat de St-Foulc entitled Une excursion √† Greffeil dans les Corbi√®res was published in 1891 in the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes Scientifiques de l'Aude.pages 115-122. In 1875 M. Charles Dat de St-Foulc, Une Excursion A Greffeil Dans les Corbi√®res, pages 116-117 (Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes Scientifiques de l'Aude, Tome II, 1891). one of Greffeil's inhabitants, Mr Barthe, unearthed an old tomb dating back to either Celtic Gaul or Roman Gaul periods; whether Boudet was aware of this discovery and used it to pen the etymology of \\"Greffeil\\" is open to debate. Boudet autographedJoseph Ageorges, \\"Une famille fran√ßaise au XIXe si√®cle (les Pag√®s et les Bordes-Pag√®s), contribution √† l'√©tude des moeurs bourgeoises\\" page 296, Tourcoing, J. Duvivier Editeur a copy of his book to the French doctor, author and politician Jacques-Auguste Bordes-Pag√®s (1815‚Äì1897). Bordes-Pag√®s made some additions of his own to Boudets's La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains. Other recipients of Boudet's book included Queen Victoria and Pedro II of Brazil. The acknowledging letters, respectively dated March 20, 1889 and September 8, 1891 have survived. The first letter sent from Biarritz and written by Sir Henry Ponsonby reads as follows: \\"Sir Henry Ponsonby presents his compliments to Monsieur Cailhol and is commanded by The Queen Victoria to request him to thank the Reverend Pere Boudet for the interesting book on Languedoc and English which he has had the kindness to present to Her Majesty.\\"Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du tr√©sor de Rennes-le- Ch√¢teau, page 281 (1985) The second letter with similar sentiments was sent from Vichy and written by the Count of Aljezur, Chamberlain to the Emperor. It reads as follows: \\"His Majesty the Emperor Don Pedro d'Alcantara instructs me to thank you most cordially for the compliment and gift that you have kindly sent to His Majesty of your scientific work that He has just received along with your letter. My noble lord is very interested in linguistic and ethnographic studies and highly appreciates the information that you have sent him, and will be happy to know the outcome of your future researches and discoveries\\".Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du tr√©sor de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, pp. 280, 284, 282 (1985); Chaumeil and Rivi√®re, L'alphabet solaire, p.248, √âditions du Borrego, 1985 One of Boudet's copies of La Vraie langue celtique bears a signed dedicationAndr√© Goudonnet, Henri Boudet, abb√© de Rennes-les-Bains: 100e anniversaire, illustrated section p.89, collection Didier Hericart de Thury- Franck Daffos, (Arqa √©ditions, 2015) to the Bishop of Carcassonne, Mgr Paul- F√©lix Ars√®ne Billard, that reads \\"A sa grandeur Monseigneur L'√âv√™que de Carcassonne.

French officer Claude Dervieu, a member of the Acad√©mie des Arts, Sciences et Belles-lettres de M√¢con used Boudet's book as one of his sources when he compiled his study on Gallo-Celtic France (Les Origines gallo-celtiques de la Nation Fran√ßaise, 1907).Ct Claude Dervieu, \\"Les Origines Gallo-Celtiques de la Nation Fran√ßaise\\", Extrait des Annales de l'Acad√©mie de M√¢con, (3e s√©rie-Tome XII), 1907, Macon, Protat fr√®res, Imprimeurs In 1909, Dervieu's study was favourably reviewed by the committee of the Soci√©t√© historique et arch√©ologique de Ch√¢teau-Thierry.

Masclet, Pr√©fet, p 213, Carcassonne, 1887 Boudet donated another copy of his book to the Biblioth√®que de la Soci√©t√© des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne in 1894.M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne, Tome VII, catalogue de la Biblioth√®que de la Soci√©t√© des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne, item number 82, page XXI, 1894 (following the article by J. Desmarest, Notes sur l'architecture de la Renaissance √† propos de l'excursion √† Toulouse, en mai 1893, pages 91-103). A Joseph Bonnafous was recorded to have done the sameBulletin de la Soci√©t√© Scientifiques de l‚ÄôAude, Dix-Huiti√®me ann√©e, page XLVI, Tome XVIII, 1907 in 1907, this time to the Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes Scientifiques de l'Aude which he was also a member and possibly the same Bonnafous who was printer in Carcassonne, rue de la Mairie and blood relative of Victor Bonnafous who printed Boudet's book. The Biblioth√®que nationale de France once held an original copy of the La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains but it went missing at some unknown date, its disappearance was reported during an inventory. The Biblioth√®que de Narbonne had also received a copy of Boudet's book in 1889.Bulletin de la Commission Arch√©ologique et Litt√©rraire de l'Arrondissement de Narbonne, page 97, 1890 In 1914, Boudet's La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains and Remarques sur la phon√©tique du Dialecte Languedocien were listed in the Literature (generalities) and in the Proven√ßal dialect (Aude dialects) sections of the Aude bibliography edited by the Bulletin de la Commission arch√©ologique de Narbonne.\\"Bulletin de la Commission arch√©ologique de Narbonne\\", La Vrai langue celtique, entry 3800, page 78; Remarques sur la phon√©tique, entry 3936, page 92 (tome XIII, premier fascicule, Narbonne, 1914) =Boudet's discoveries= Boudet was credited with the discovery of a water-container embossed with a Christian cross in around 1886Paul Courrent, \\"Notice Historique sur les Bains de Rennes connus anciennement sous le nom de Bains de Montferrand\\", plate between pages 244-245 in, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√©tudes scientifiques de l'Aude, Tome XXXVIII, 1934. and of a statue of the goddess Venus in around 1900 in the maison Chaluleau in Rennes-les-Bains (the statue was sold in America).Urbain Gibert, \\"Notes Historiques sur les Bains de Montferrand devenues les Bains de Rennes, Actuellement Rennes-les-Bains\\", page 226, footnote 14, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√àtudes Scientifiques de l‚ÄôAude, Tome LXXIII, 1973) =Commemorative plaque= A commemorative plaque marking the centenary of Henri Boudet's death was placed in the church porch in Rennes-les-Bains on 6 June 2015. It was unveiled by the village mayor Andr√© Authier in the presence of the deputy mayor Marcelle Delmas. Association with Sauni√®re and Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau There are no first-hand accounts available of Boudet and Sauni√®re being close acquaintances, nor did Boudet ever undertake any historical researches in the village of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau. The only connection that is certain is Boudet and Sauni√®re were assigned to the same Diocese and their respective towns who lies at a short distance from each other, shared the same name. Some Rennes- le-Ch√¢teau researchers are inclined to identify the BS monogram inscribed on the statue of the Devil supporting the Holy Water Stoup, located at the entrance to the church of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, with the surname initials of Boudet and Sauni√®re or the names of two local rivers, the Blanque and the Sals (as first envisaged by G√©rard de S√®de in 1967L'Or de Rennes, pages 166-167.Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du Tr√©sor de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau (1985).), but there is no concrete evidence as to what the inscription actually means and remains undeciphered. Sauni√®re referred to himself as B.S. in an early draft of his Will and testament written a short time after the death of his brother Alfred.Claire Corbu, Antoine Captier, \\"L'H√©ritage de l'Abb√© Sauni√®re\\", facsimile of a draft of an early version of Sauni√®re's will, circa 1906-1907, page 20, (Editions B√©lisane, 1985). Conspiracy theories Because Henri Boudet was Abb√© of Rennes-les-Bains at the same period of time that B√©renger Sauni√®re was incumbent at Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, also for being the author of La Vraie langue celtique, he has become a central character in modern conspiracy theories. G√©rard de S√®de, in collaboration with Pierre Plantard, offered a romantic interpretation of La Vraie Langue Celtique et le cromleck de Rennes- les-Bains in his 1967 book L‚ÄôOr de Rennes,G√©rard de S√®de, L'Or de Rennes, pages 116-122 (Ren√© Julliard, 1967). claiming that Boudet wrote his book in a cryptic style that represented a code. De S√®de interpreted the Church of Rennes-les-Bains and its churchyard also as part of a secret code, that led to and involved Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau.G√©rard de S√®de, L'Or de Rennes, pages 123-135, (Ren√© Julliard, 1967). As de S√®de‚Äôs 1967 book became an immediate success, renewed interest increased in La Vraie Langue Celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains, a book that only a few people had heard about previously. Boudet‚Äôs book was re-edited in two different editions in 1978: a facsimile edition by Pierre Belfond, Paris, part of les classiques de l‚Äôoccultisme, containing a foreword by Pierre Plantard and the second one, in a limited edition of 1,000 copies by La demeure Philosophale, Paris, with a foreword by G√©rard de S√®de (this edition did not respect the original pagination of Boudet's book). Pierre Plantard, without providing any reliable sources in his 1978 foreword to Boudet's La Vraie langue celtique, claimed the book was published as a limited-edition of 500 copies that cost 5,382 francs: consisting of 98 copies sold in 28 years between 1886 and 1914; 100 free copies given to Public libraries, embassies and charities; 200 free copies available to visitors and patients who took the waters at the spa resort at Rennes-les-Bains interested in linguistics (or to any priests likely to be interested) ‚Äì and the remaining 102 copies, according to Plantard, destroyed in 1914. In fact, Boudet's book La Vraie Langue Celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains was available directly from the printer, Victor Bonnafous in Carcassonne, at the retail price of 3,50 francs and by mail order at the price of 3,75 francs,Andr√© Goudonnet, Henri Boudet, abb√© de Rennes-les-Bains: 100e anniversaire, illustrated section p.96, (Arqa √©ditions, 2015) or 3,90 francs, as advertised in Le Courrier de l'Aude of 27 January 1887 (page 3).Courrier de l'Aude 27 janvier 1887 , page 3 (33me Ann√©e, N¬∞ 4025). If the 3,50 francs is applied to the 500 copies said to have been printed as Plantard claimed, this totalled 1,750 francs, well below the said sum of 5,382 francs the book is reputed to have cost. In his preface, Plantard also claimed that \\"someone from Axat\\" found Boudet's account books on a rubbish tip and these revealed that between 1887 and 1891 Boudet gave 3,679,431 francs to Marie Denarnaud (Sauni√®re's housekeeper); and that between 1894 and 1903 had given her 837,260 francs (in the same period, Boudet had given 7,665,250 francs to the Bishop of Carcassonne, Mgr Billard). Plantard's claims attracted the following criticisms: There is no evidence that Boudet was wealthy enough to give donations involving tens of millions of francs; Boudet's account books have never been seen and Plantard did not disclose the name of the person who had found them; there is no evidence in Sauni√®re's papers that Boudet was involved with the refurbishment of the church of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau.Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau: A Mystery Solved, page 236 (2005 edition). But some of Sauni√®re's account books are available, spanning from July, 1895 to November 1915 showing that Sauni√®re received small amounts of money from Boudet on an irregular basis, dating from March 1896, March and October 1897, January and November 1898, March 1899 and March 1900, amounting to a grand total of 290 francs. In his 1988 book entitled, Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau; Le dossier, les impostures, les phantasmes, les hypoth√®ses, de S√®de affirmed once again that Boudet wrote La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains in a cryptic fashion, adding to his 1967 analysis that Boudet used Jonathan Swift's A Discourse to Prove the Antiquity of the English Tongue, Showing from various instances, that Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were derived from the English (1712) Chapter contained in Jonathan Swift's 1712 book, A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue. Quoting from A discourse to prove the antiquity of the English tongue: \\"Thus I have manifestly proved, that the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews spoke the language we now do in England; which is an honour to our country that I thought proper to set in a true light, and yet hath not been done, as I have heard, by any other writer.\\" and his Ars Punica, sive flos lingarum; The Art of Punning or the flower of languages in 79 rules (1719) as a method of encryption. De S√®de also added that \\"la Vraie langue celtique\\" and its associated subject matter, \\"le cromlech de Rennes-les-Bains\\" are not the real theme of Boudet's book but in fact, a treatise on secret geography.

Sir: Just a Normal Guy La Rosa made her directorial debut in 2001 with \\"Sir: Just a Normal Guy\\" where she explored LGBT rights. Her film depicts transgender issues as she documents the transitional period of the female-to-male procedure and the search for social acceptance. As she follows Jay Snyder through the transformative phase and his assimilation into society. La Rosa documents Snyder as he searches for acceptance and personal identity. Her cinematic portrayal of Snyder's incredible endeavour evokes themes of identity and belonging that are recurrent within La Rosa's filmography. \\"Sir: Just a Normal Guy\\" has premiered at a number of film festivals and LGBT rallies including OUTrageous: Santa Barbara LBGT Film Festival, IndieFest: The San Francisco Independent Film Festival, and TrannyFest San Francisco.\\"Sir: Just a Normal Guy\\", Women Make Movies. http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c816.shtml The film has also been exhibited on a global scale and has received accolades for its activist undercurrents and its thoughtful representation of transgender issues.

The installation entitled Erased (2012) is consider one of Jasper's most important works using cinematographic images.Krzysztof Kosciuczuk, Christian Tomaszewski, Frieze Magazine, Issue 152, January‚ÄìFebruary, 2013. The work consists of three videos with sound in an empty gallery space. Erased was first shown at Le Guern Gallery in Warsaw, Poland in 2012. In 2013, the work was shown at The Standard, in Hollywood, and then in 2015 at the Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ at a joint exhibition with Joanna Malinowska entitled ZwiƒÖzki rozwiƒÖzki/ Relations Disrelations. The artist digitally modified two movies erasing all human presence from the segments of the films Blue Velvet by David Lynch and The Tin Drum by Volker Schl√∂ndorff. A third video was a looped excerpt from Stanley Kramer's 1995 drama On the Beach, played on a computer screen at the gallery's reception desk.James Voorhies, Something else, something more than exhibition and cinema: the art of C.T.

Following allegations of his inappropriate sexual behavior, Henderson was terminated by the Detroit Free Press in December 2017. Early life and education A native of Detroit, Michigan, Henderson graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1988 and the University of Michigan in 1992. Career Henderson has worked for the Baltimore Sun, the Chicago Tribune, the Lexington Herald-Leader, and Knight Ridder as a reporter, editorial writer and editor. He was the Editorial Page Editor and a columnist for the Detroit Free Press from 2009 to 2017. Henderson has hosted the daily talk show \\"Detroit Today\\" on WDET since 2015, and he hosts the weekly talk show \\"American Black Journal\\" on Detroit Public Television and co-hosts the news show \\"MiWeek\\" on Detroit Public Television. In 2014 he won both the Pulitzer Prize for commentary and the National Association of Black Journalists Journalist of the Year Award for his writing on Detroit's financial crisis. He is also a two-time winner of the Scripps Howard Award for Commentary. In 2016, Henderson wrote that Michiganders should take legislators who took money to shield Michigan's charter schools from oversight, \\"sew them into burlap sacks with rabid animals, and toss them into the Straits of Mackinac\\",. He then tweeted the column with another call for violence against legislators: \\"GOP House harlots deserve worse than hanging for selling out #detroit kids on #DPS bills.\\" After a backlash from conservatives, he tweeted that his remark was \\"hyperbole.\\" \\"Everyone knows I don't have access to that much burlap,\\" he said.

Rideout, who hosted a talk show on Detroit's 910 AM, was then suspended by radio station management because he did not identify the alleged victims. In response to Rideout's press conference, the Free Press conducted an internal investigation into the allegations. After the internal review, Henderson was fired from the Detroit Free Press for \\"inappropriate behavior\\" towards female employees that had occurred over several years. In response to his firing, Henderson said on his own radio show that he apologized to the women involved and said it was \\"bad judgement\\" on his part, but he also said that he disagreed with the decision by the Free Press and would be \\"exploring legal action.\\" Henderson's attorney has said there was no lawsuit and that a settlement was reached in July 2018 between her client Henderson and his former employers at the Detroit Free Press.

Life =Early years= Calevaert was born in Deinze, a small town a short distance to the southwest of Ghent. His father, also named Justinus Calewaert, was a successful businessman, with premises in the Tolpportstraat, who also ran a distillery. When war broke out in 1914 Calevaert went initially to England, but he later returned to Belgium and served as a stretcher bearer on the front line. He studied at St Hendrik's College in Deinze and at the St Barbara College, a Jesuit school in Ghent, before moving on to the Catholic University of Louvain. He was ordained into the priesthood on 23 April 1922. =Priest= On 4 February 1925 he took a post as professor of Moral theology at the \\"CIBE\\"CIBE = Centre d'Instruction de Base et d'Ecolage (military academy) in Leopoldsburg, becoming director at this institution in 1927. On 1 October 1931 he was appointed president of the Main Seminary at Ghent, and in 1940 he became Vicar general for the diocese. In the context of the linguistic sensitivities of the time and place, the Ghent born composer observed that Calewaert appeared to come from the Francophone class (\\"....les gens d'expression fran√ßaise\\"), although since he came from Deinze he also spoke perfectly good Flemish (Dutch). =Bishop= On 28 January 1948 Calewaert was appointed 27th Bishop of Ghent in succession to Honor√© Jozef Coppieters who had died the previous month. Calewaert, now aged 54, was installed on 8 March 1948. He took as his motto \\"Caritate veritatis\\" (\\"From Love of Truth\\"). On 17 April 1948 Oscar Joliet was appointed as Calewaert's auxiliary bishop. In 1950 he dedicated the St Paul Seminary at Mariakerke in the chateau bequeathed by the aristocrat-politician , where seminarians could undertake the first two years of their training. On 16 May 1954 he dedicated the entire complex at . During the 1955 schools conflict he wrote, on 8 July 1955, a pastoral letter calling on the faithful to support free education through the \\"School and family\\" programme, in respect of which a commemorative plaque was produced in 1958. Also in 1955, on 19 December 1955, it fell to Caelwaert to dedicate the important Temse Bridge at Themse when it was opened by The King. Karel Justinus Calewaert died on 12 March 1963, a couple of months after his 70th birthday. His body was buried in the crypt of his cathedral, St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent.

Early life MacDougall was born in Pollokshaws and was educated at Shawlands Academy. His father, a tailor also named James, served as the provost of Pollokshaws from 1905 until 1911, and held unionist views.The Plebs, Vols. 50-51, p.127 However MacDougall was increasingly influenced by his two uncles who lived nearby: John and Daniel, a disabled cobbler, who were active in the Progressive Union, an anarchist group in which John Maclean was involved.Nan Milton, John Maclean, p.20 McDougall left school at an early age and found work as a clerk at the Clydesdale Bank.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, p.28 Social Democratic Federation In 1906, John Maclean, already a well-known socialist, gave a series of speeches in Pollokshaws, his home town. The speeches inspired the formation of a local branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), and MacDougall became its first secretary, aged only sixteen. MacDougall soon became a leading supporter of Maclean, working with him in the co-operative movement, in particular campaigning for it to organise classes to teach Marxist economics.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, pp.60-61 He personally taught well- attended classes in locations including Paisley and Lanarkshire.Frederic Lee, A History of Heterodox Economics, p.109 MacDougall lost his job when a local landlord wrote to the Clydesdale, threatening to withdraw his money unless MacDougall was sacked. MacDougall and Maclean responded by launching a campaign for trade unions to withdraw their money from the bank.Tom Bell, John Maclean: a fighter for freedom, pp.17-18 The Falkirk branch of the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland did so, and MacDougall later repaid this by working unpaid for the ironmoulders while they were on strike in 1912. British Socialist Party and the Clyde Workers Committee The SDF became the British Socialist Party in 1911, and MacDougall attended its first conference, the following year, at which he was appointed to a committee to investigate grievances in the Aberdeen branch.The first annual conference of the British Socialist Party, British Socialist Party, p.10 Around this time, he became interested in syndicalism, a position which Maclean did not share, but this did not produce a lasting rift, and MacDougall was soon back to acting as Maclean's chief supporter.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, pp.57 In 1914, MacDougall was elected to the Eastwood School Board, joining his comrade James Blair, the SDF's greatest success in the area.Nan Milton, John Maclean, p.43 The following year, he worked with Maclean to relaunch The Vanguard, newspaper of the Glasgow BSP. They used this to make anti-war propaganda, a position they tried to get the Clyde Workers' Committee to adopt.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, pp.86-88 The Socialist Labour Party held a majority on the committee and disagreed, at one point having MacDougall and Peter Petroff removed from a meeting for trying to debate the subject.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.275 Opposing the war often led to trouble from the authorities and confrontations with pro-war groups. In 1916, he and Jimmy Maxton spoke at a meeting on Glasgow Green against the deportation of David Kirkwood, and the two were arrested and charged with inducing workers to obstruct the war effort. They were advised to plead guilty, and were sentenced to twelve months; around the same time, Maclean, Willie Gallacher and many other leaders of the Clyde Workers' Committee were jailed.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, pp.94-96William Knox, James Maxton, pp.23-25 Kept in Calton Jail in Edinburgh, MacDougall struggled mentally during his time inside. At the 1918 general election, MacDougall stood for the BSP in Glasgow Tradeston. Unlike some BSP candidates, he did not receive the support of the Labour Party, although its local Glasgow committee gave him its support, so he did not face any Labour opposition.John Hannan, The life of John Wheatley, p.69 He took 19.4% of the votes cast, the best performance of any BSP candidate who did not have official Labour Party backing.David Boothroyd, Politico's guide to the history of British political parties, p.24 Activities in the 1920s Unconvinced about the merits of the new Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), Maclean established the Communist Labour Party in 1920, but was not able to attend the founding conference, so MacDougall led support for Maclean's positions at its founding conference. However, Gallacher convinced a majority of delegates that it should instead seek to join the CPGB, barracking the official speakers and nearly starting fights, and he succeeded in defeating MacDougall in the votes.Raymond Challinor, The Origins of British Bolshevism, p.249 Maclean left the group, joining the Socialist Labour Party, and MacDougall may have followed him.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, p.145 In 1919, a Scottish Labour College was opened, largely on the initiative of Maclean, MacDougall, Maxton, Gallacher and Helen Crawfurd.Lindsay Patterson, Scottish Education in the Twentieth Century, p.97 Two years later, the offices of the Scottish Labour College were raided by the police, and MacDougall was sentenced to sixty days in prison for incitement and sedition.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, p.146 This second imprisonment led MacDougall to suffer what was described as a \\"nervous collapse\\", and kept him out of political activity for some time.Brian John Ripley and J. McHugh, John Maclean, p.149 As he recovered, he spent time trying to organise unemployed workers as part of Maclean's Tramp Trust Unlimited and did some work at the Scottish Labour College, but became increasingly disillusioned and gave few speeches. The CPGB unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to resume political activity for them;Tom Bell, John Maclean: a fighter for freedom, p.113 however, he wrote a number of articles for Communist Review in 1925 and 1926 and appears to have briefly held membership of the party. MacDougall visited the Soviet Union in 1926, on the invitation of the CPGB. However, he was unhappy with his treatment there, as a privileged guest, while conditions for workers and peasants were poor. On his return to Britain, he disassociated himself from the communist movement and began writing for Nineteenth Century and the New Statesman, and joined the Liberal Party.The Times House of Commons, 1929 He stood for the Liberals in Rutherglen at the 1929 general election, but took only 8.8% of the vote and was not elected.Gilbert MacAllister, James Maxton: The Portrait of a Rebel, p.69 Later life MacDougall next joined Oswald Mosley's New Party,Brian John Ripley and J.

During World War II, MacDougall was isolated from his former comrades and without work, ultimately finding a job as a clerk at a jam factory. In the 1950s, he became known for anti-Catholicism, and supported the Conservative Party.

The make of a cold coffee using Nespresso coffeemaker and a cold coffee Nespresso capsule Nestl√© Nespresso S.A., trading as Nespresso, is an operating unit of the Nestl√© Group, based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Nespresso machines brew espresso and coffee from coffee capsules, or pods in machines for home or professional use,Commercial Coffee Capsule Range (Nespresso Pro Spain) a type of pre- apportioned single-use container of ground coffee beans, sometimes with added flavorings. Once inserted into a machine, the capsules are pierced and processed, water is then forced against a heating element at high pressure meaning that only the quantity for a single cup is warmed. Nespresso is a premium price coffee, and by 2011 had annual sales in excess of 3 billion Swiss francs. The word Nespresso is a portmanteau of Nestl√© and Espresso, a common mechanic used across other Nestl√© brands (Nescaf√©, BabyNes, Nesquik). All Nespresso coffee is roasted, ground and encapsulated in one of three factories in Switzerland (Avenches, Orbe, and Romont), but the company sells its system of machines and capsules worldwide, as well as the VertuoLine system in North America and certain other countries.  History  In 1975 Eric Favre, an employee of Nestl√©, noticed that one a coffee bar near the Pantheon in Rome, Italy had a disproportionately large number of customers. He found that the only difference between that bar and the many others using the same machines was that operators pumped the piston many times before releasing the coffee, while others did so only once. The repeated pumping forced more water and air into the ground coffee, causing greater oxidisation and hence drawing out more flavour from the beans, and produced better crema, foam on top of a good espresso. Favre invented the Nespresso system. The pod containing the coffee was sealed, keeping it fresh. In use it ensured greater aeration, like the repeated pumping Favre had noticed. In operation, a sharp- pointed spout would pierce the capsule and inject pressurised hot water, forcing the foil against a spiked plate which burst it inwards, letting the espresso flow out of the spout. The system was patented by Nestl√© in 1976. Early prototypes were complicated machines with large tanks and pumps and tubes; the machine was not ready for the market for a decade. It was introduced to the Swiss market, looking like large traditional commercial espresso machines, initially without significant success. Nespresso first tested its new concept in Japan in 1986, and rolled it out to consumers in Switzerland, France, Italy and Japan the same year. A decade later, in part due to the efforts of Jean-Paul Gaillard, who introduced the Le Club community‚Äîproviding Nestl√© with a large database of customers and their preferences‚Äîreduced prices of machines but increased capsule prices, changed the machine from an office machine into a luxury brand now available to consumers, and licensed production by other companies, the product became more successful. In 1990, Nestl√© signed a contract with Turmix, which started to sell Nespresso machines in Switzerland. Thereafter, other contracts were signed with Krups, Magimix, Alessi, Philips, Siemens and De'Longhi. Starting out as an e-commerce business, Nespresso only opened their first boutique in Paris in 2000 as a concept store.(https://m.tdg.ch/categories/rticles) Today, Nespresso has a global network of more than 700 boutiques in 68 countries. In later years there was friction between Favre‚Äîwho came up with the concept and developed the first machines‚Äîand Gaillard, who made the machine a commercial success. Favre resigned in 1990 after personality clashes, and the two men were critical of each other. Gaillard left Nestl√© in 1997 after falling out with CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe. He claimed that the original idea for Nespresso was bought by Nestl√© in 1973, and did not come from Favre, though Nespresso denies this. In 2008 Gaillard launched a company that sold biodegradable capsules for Nespresso machines, competing with Nespresso.  Nespresso system  = Machines = Nespresso sells or licenses a number of different machines mostly made in Europe. The machines carry well-known kitchen-equipment manufacturers' names such as Krups, Breville, and DeLonghi, but are mostly manufactured by Eugster/Frismag, a Swiss company that is one of the world's largest coffee-machine producers. DeLonghi manufactures the Lattissima models in Italy exclusively. Eugster/Frismag is strictly an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and does not sell under its own brand. In 2000 Nespresso began distributing machines bearing the \\"Nespresso\\" brand. There are numerous models that range in complexity and price, from the entry level Inissia, U and Pixie ranges. = Capsules = Nespresso capsules were sold exclusively by Nespresso while the machines were under patent, and are significantly more expensive than an equivalent quantity of \\"loose\\" ground coffee. Because of the hermetically sealed capsule, however, the coffee aroma does not degrade with time like coffee in a pack that has been opened. Nespresso currently sells 28 different Original Line arabica and robusta capsules. Limited Edition are released seasonally. As the system is no longer under patent, more and more third-party and refillable capsules can now be purchased in some grocery stores and shops. Each capsule contains 5‚Äì7 grams of ground coffee and makes one serving of coffee. Depending on the length of the pour, the capsule can produce a 40 ml Espresso shot, or a 110 ml Lungo (long) pour. Nespresso-supplied capsule bodies and perforated tops are both made of aluminium, while third-party capsules are made from a variety of materials, including plastic and aluminium. To assuage some concerns on potential aluminium health effects, most of the capsule interior of Nespresso capsules is lined with food-grade lacquer. For the business market, a different system of Nespresso pods exists. These pad-shaped capsules are not interchangeable with the consumer capsules. = Process = Nespresso's hermetically sealed capsules are made of aluminium. Depending on the Nespresso system being used, the flat top or the pointed end of the capsule is pierced when inserted into the machine and the compartment lever is lowered. Some machines make a single large hole, and others make three smaller holes. When the machine is activated it pumps hot water under high pressure into injector holes poked into the narrow end of the capsule upon insertion. This causes the flat bottom of the capsule to rupture, as it is made of thinner foil than the rest of the capsule. The base of the capsule holder (on which the capsule sits) has a number of raised squares which cause the foil to rupture at these points. The brewed coffee exits the capsule through these rupture holes and flows through a funnel nozzle into the coffee cup. As in pressure cookers, a safety pressure release valve inside the brewing chamber prevents an explosion from occurring if the normal coffee exhaust path becomes blocked.  VertuoLine system  To appeal to the demand by North Americans for larger servings of coffee than the original Nespresso machine produces, in February 2014 Nespresso launched a new Vertuoline system of machines and capsules in the United States and Canada. The system produces Espresso (40ml/1.35oz), Double Espresso (80ml/2.7oz), Gran Lungo (150ml/5oz), Mug/Coffee (230ml/8oz) and Alto/Alto XL (414ml/14oz) cup sizes that characterises espresso coffees and the original line of Nespresso coffees. Nespresso simultaneously uses over 25 blends in specially-designed VertuoLine capsules. The VertuoLine capsules cannot be used in the original line of Nespresso machines (now branded \\"OriginalLine\\" in North America). Nespresso continues to sell both OriginalLine and VertuoLine machines and capsules in the United States and Canada, targeting different market segments with the two systems. The VertuoLine system uses two technologies not found in the OriginalLine. First, the system uses \\"centrifusion\\" (a term created by Nespresso, being a portmanteau of centrifugal force and infusion), whereby it spins the capsule around in the machine at up to 7,000 rpm to blend the ground coffee and hot water. Second, each capsule has a barcode embedded on the rim, and the barcode laser scanning system reads 5 different parameters: rotational speed, temperature, infusion time, volume and flow of water. Some critics claim that the VertuoLine technology, particularly the use of bar codes, is an attempt by Nestl√© to create a new proprietary Nespresso system which excludes compatible capsules from other companies. The VertuoLine system was intended to expand Nespresso's product line to offer coffee closer to the American style of filtered coffee, and thus expand Nespresso's market share in North America. In the United States, Nespresso had only a 3% share of the single- serve coffee market in the year before the introduction of VertuoLine (compared with 72% for Green Mountain's Keurig system), while in Canada Nespresso had 4 to 5% of the single-serve market in 2013 (compared to approximately 53% for Keurig and 40% for Tassimo). In comparison, Nestl√© had 70% of the single-serve market in Europe in 2013. At the time of the introduction of the VertuoLine system in 2014, there were no plans to launch the system in markets outside Canada and the United States. However, sales of the VertuoLine system were expanded beyond North America in 2016, first with the launch of the system in France in 2016 under the name Vertuo (with the original line branded \\"Original\\"), and with later roll outs in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Australia. As of 2018, Nespresso aimed to introduce the Vertuoline system in eight additional European markets by the end of the year.Corinne Gretler, \\"Nespresso's Larger Coffee Pods Won't Work With Your Machine\\", Bloomberg, 5 October 2018 In September 2019, the VertuoLine system launched in the Middle East in Kuwait, UAE, and KSA under the name \\"Vertuo\\".http://aeworld.com/lifestyle/nespresso- has-launched-the-new-vertuo-coffee-machine-and-were-never-looking-back/  Business model  =Patent expiry and focus on image= A Nespresso store in Lugano, Switzerland In 2010 the concept (machine, capsule, service) was still subject to 1,700 patents which protected Nespresso's ownership of the concept until their expiry, leading to comparisons of Nespresso with printer manufacturers that block the sale of generic ink cartridges to achieve a vendor lock-in effect. This contrasts with some other prepackaged coffee preparation systems. Nespresso's patents began to expire in 2012, gradually allowing competitors to offer capsules and machines compatible with the Nespresso system. By 2010, Nestl√© was working on ways to prevent competitors from doing this. The service part of Nespresso's business model‚Äîthe Nespresso Club and Nespresso stores and cafes‚Äîwas aimed to be a long-term defence for the brand, its elevated image and premium pricing. Beyond attentive customer service and being the only places where most customers can replenish their 'pods', the brand has been able to maintain images of exclusivity and suave connoisseur-ship.Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015. Rethinking Prestige Branding - Secrets of the Ueber-Brands. Kogan Page. pp.165ff. Actor George Clooney appeared in ads for Nespresso, with company representatives insisting that he had been elected by Club members to become the brand's ambassador (vs the brand 'buying his sponsorship'), in a form of celebrity advertising that emphasises the status of the brand over that of the endorsing star.Kuehlwein, JP. How Ueber-Brands turn Celebrity Endorsements on their Head, www.ueberbrands.com 11/2015 = Market = Packaged portions of espresso coffee, like those from Nespresso, has become one of the fastest growing segments of the coffee market, accounting for 20 to 40 percent of the value of ground coffee sales in the US$17 billion European coffee market. In August 2010, it was reported that Nespresso sales had been growing at an average of 30 percent per year over the previous 10 years, and more than 20 billion capsules had been sold since 2000 at a selling price equivalent to about US$0.43 to US$0.62 per capsule. Nespresso reported annual sales of CHF 3 billion in 2011, growing by 20% during the fiscal year.Nestl√© Annual Report 2011 = Cost = Nespresso sources most of its coffee through the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program. In 2017 the company reported that 82% of beans were sourced through the scheme. In the US, the price of capsules ranges from a standard US$0.70 to US$2.00 for limited editions. In Europe, capsule prices were around ‚Ç¨0.35 in the Netherlands.  Ecological impact  Unless the capsule is recycled, each capsule produces 1g of aluminium waste. Recycling aluminium uses as little as 5% of the energy needed to produce aluminium from ore.The 100%recyclable capsule: Nespresso website , 13 May 2007. In English. Retrieved 2007-05-13. Initially, Nestl√© did not implement any recycling programs outside a few areas of Switzerland. This led to a large amount of waste generation, which was criticised by user groups. As of 2017, Nespresso has set up capsule-collection systems in 36 countries. France and Switzerland are some of Nespresso's biggest buyers so the recycling facilities are more accessible in these countries. Only 24.6% of Nespresso capsules are recycled globally, but the company states that it has the capacity to recycle 100% of its capsules through its recycling program. The proportion of recycled aluminium in the capsules is not known, but is estimated to be greater than 80% of capsules produced (per annum) as of 2015. , Freedom, Nicole della Pietra, Wednesday, 14 February 2007 (the site of Jean-Luc Pasquier). The company has launched a program called \\"√©colaboration\\" to try to remedy the problem. The program set out with goals around recycling and sustainability. The program targets were met in 2014, and a new sustainability program was launched: \\"The Positive Cup\\". This strategy includes goals on sustainable coffee sourcing under the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program‚Ñ¢. The AAA Program, which was developed with the Rainforest Alliance and launched in 2003, is focused on helping farmers who grow and supply Nespresso's coffee. Nespresso claims to do this by teaching farmers best business and growing practices. Farmers are not obliged to sell to Nespresso, although many choose to as Nespresso offer a fair price for the coffee and help in all aspects of the farmers' business. Nespresso offers up to a 40% premium on the price of beans, and some 75,000 farmers from 12 countries are participating in the AAA Program . In 2019 Nespresso partnered with Swedish company V√©losophy to create a commercially available bicycle out of recycled Nespresso pods. Other projects also include collaborating with Caran Dache to create a ball point pen out of recycled coffee pods. Nespresso Pro, OriginalLine and VertuoLine capsules can be recycled at one of Nespresso's recycling facilities.  Marketing campaigns  George Clooney is considered the \\"face of Nespresso\\" and has been starring in Nespresso's ad campaigns since 2006, first in European and international campaigns and since 2015 in US market ones as well. In these campaigns Clooney has paired with actors such as John Malkovich, Danny DeVito and Matt Damon, who reportedly received $3 million for his participation. In the summer of 2020 amid Covid-19 outbreaks, Nespresso released a new ad on their Youtube page that focused on sustainability and a commitment to doing better for the planet  Competitors and litigation  = Machines = In August 2011 the Australian company Kogan announced the development of the \\"Ez-press\\", a coffee machine compatible with Nespresso pods.\\", = Capsules = In 2008 Jean-Paul Gaillard, a former CEO at Nespresso, started a rival firm, Ethical Coffee Company SA (ECC), to make compatible biodegradable capsules for the Nespresso machine, withdrawing from this \\"loss-making\\" market in 2017. In March 2016, Starbucks announced that it would sell Nespresso-compatible capsules in Europe. These were launched with four core pods including three single origin pods, and are compatible with all consumer Nespresso machines, but not those such as a commercial Nespresso machine or in a Miele integrated unit. = Litigation = In March 2011 the Swiss discount supermarket, Denner, won a court battle with Nestl√© over the sale of plastic Nespresso-compatible capsules, at about half the retail price of Nespresso capsules. By 2014 Nespresso had been involved in further legal disputes about pods with competitors in the UK, Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands; one media report said \\"Nestl√© has lost in just about every one of those conflicts.\\" In France‚ÄîNespresso's largest market, which made a quarter of its global sales at the time‚Äîthe antitrust watchdog Autorit√© de la concurrence stated that \\"it appears that Nespresso may have abused its dominant position by tying the purchase of its capsules to that of its coffee machines, with no fair justification, de facto ousting rival capsule makers\\". The company agreed to cease making the guarantee on its single-serving coffee machines conditional on using only Nespresso pods, and to remove warnings against the use of third-party pods.

Gerber is a subsidiary of Nestl√©. History Gerber was founded in 1927 in Fremont, Michigan, by Daniel Frank Gerber, owner of the Fremont Canning Company, which produced canned fruit and vegetables. At the suggestion of a pediatrician, Gerber's wife, Dorothy, began making hand- strained food for their seven-month-old daughter, Sally. Recognising a business opportunity, Gerber began making baby food. By 1928 he had developed five products for the market: beef vegetable soup and strained peas, prunes, carrots, and spinach. Six months later, Gerber's baby foods were distributed nationwide. Some believe that Dorothy Gerber was the initial inspiration behind their baby food products. One day after a visit to her infant daughter's pediatrician she toiled in the kitchen straining fruits and vegetables for her child. After much hard work she suggested to her husband Daniel, whose family already owned the Fremont Canning Company, to create this food in an industrial setting, lightening the load of mothers everywhere. A different interpretation of the story is that he was frustrated and upset having come home to find his wife looking strained and miserable in the kitchen. Not wanting to \\"exchange\\" his beautiful wife for this kitchen-bound monstrosity, he then invented the Gerber baby food product line.Bentley, Amy. \\"Chapter 1.\\" Inventing Baby Food: Taste, Health, and the Industrialization of the American Diet. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 31-42. Print. In 1994, Gerber merged with Sandoz Laboratories. Two years later, Sandoz merged with CIBA-Geigy to form Novartis, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. In 2007, Gerber was sold to Nestl√© for $5.5 billion.\\"Novartis Completes its Business Portfolio Restructuring, Divesting Gerber for USD 5.5 Billion to Nestl√© .\\" Novartis, 12 April 2007.\\"Novartis Completes Divestment Program with Transfer of Gerber Baby Foods Business .\\" Novartis, 3 September 2007. The brand eventually became a major company in the baby food industry, currently offering more than 190 products in 80 countries, with labeling in 16 languages. Its primary competitors are Beech-Nut and Del Monte Foods. , Gerber controls 61 percent of the baby food market in the United States.  Product diversification  In 1960 Gerber started selling its baby food in glass jars, which often found new life as household storage, especially in home workshops. Soon after, other items such as pacifiers, baby bottles, and small baby toys were introduced. In 2003 Gerber partially replaced the glass jars with plastic tubs for vegetables and some fruits. Other fruits and meats are still sold in jars. In 1967 executives at Gerber Products decided to offer a line of life insurance products aimed at young families. Today, the Gerber Life Insurance Company is one of the largest purveyors of direct-marketed life insurance in the United States. Gerber Life currently has more than two million life insurance policies in force, with more than $650 million in assets. The company's term and whole life insurance products for adults and children are available in the United States, Puerto Rico, and most of Canada. Gerber Life currently has an \\"A\\" (\\"Excellent\\") rating with independent rating entity AM Best, the third-highest rating out of thirteen categories. In 2018, Gerber Life Insurance was sold to Western & Southern Financial Group, who continue to use the Gerber trademark under license. Early in the 1990s, Gerber tried to enter into the sugar-free food market with a Sugar Free Vanilla Custard flavor, favorable to diabetic babies. The product did not see as much demand as expected, so it was dropped after a few years. Gerber also began to produce juices, which are still being sold as of March 2009. In 1999 Gerber established skincare products for babies. Other Gerber products currently produced include breastfeeding supplies, such as the Premium Feeding System Manual Massaging Pump, as well as baby bottles and nipples. They also market a line of health care products, including Tooth and Gum Cleanser and Vitamin Drops.  Consumer relations  Gerber has a long history of projecting a family-friendly image. When Gerber Products established a consumer relations department in 1938, then ten-year-old Sally Gerber began answering each customer's letter individually, a practice she would continue for many years, even after she became a senior vice president of the company. In 1986 the company set up the Gerber Parents' Resource Center, a toll-free customer relations hotline, which has been providing information on baby food and parenting issues ever since.  Gerber Baby  According to Gerber, Ann Turner Cook is the famous Gerber Baby whose portrait is featured prominently on all Gerber product packaging. Cook is now a retired teacher and mystery writer. She was depicted in a charcoal sketch by her neighbor, Dorothy Hope Smith. Smith entered the sketch for the company's logo contest. A huge draw to the image of the Gerber baby is largely due to the fact that this baby is alone, not in the presence of adults, innocently peering straight into the eyes of the consumer. This innocent outward gaze was surely a marketing, if not psychological, technique to suck in female \\"mother-consumers\\".Bentley, Amy. \\"Chapter 1.\\" Inventing Baby Food: Taste, Health, and the Industrialization of the American Diet. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 38. Print. This forced many mothers to seek the happiness of their own child via the eyes of the iconic Gerber baby.

Tax break and expansion  Gerber Products Company Specimen Stock Certificate c.1971 In September 2008, Gerber's Fremont facilities were designated as a Michigan Agricultural Renaissance Zone, receiving $43 million in tax breaks over 15 years. In order to receive the incentives, Gerber agreed to continue its employment in Fremont at 1,100 jobs and invest $50 million in its Fremont facilities over the course of the next ten years. However, to get the full 15 years of tax breaks, Gerber agreed to increase employment by 200 and spend a total of $75 million on its facilities. The tax breaks have been largely supported, despite large revenue losses by local governments: $300,000 in losses per year for the City of Fremont (10% of their budget) and $160,000 a year for Newaygo County. It is estimated local governments would give up potentially $15 million in revenue over the 15 years as part of the tax break. Both the county and the city will be working with the Fremont Area Community Foundation to receive funds in the initial years to help with specific projects and programs. The Fremont Public School District would receive assistance through the state school aid formula. Nestl√© Nutrition North America CEO Kurt Schmidt said that the Fremont research and development center will be one of 23 worldwide Nestl√© \\"product technology centers\\" and also include scientific research for baby and infant nutritional products. It is expected that the new investment will help make Newaygo County a \\"global leader in scientific research\\".

History Acquisition of the land where the ground is located started in 1980, with purchase of an adjacent area and celebration of a partnership with company Precon for the construction of the main buildings happening in 1984. The first training pitch was completed in 1982, but from 1985 to 1998 construction for the then named \\"Centro de Treinamento do Galo\\" remained largely stalled. In 2001, the club's first-squad moved from Vila Ol√≠mpica, the club's old training grounds, to the Centro de Treinamento, despite construction being unfinished. From 2001 onwards construction restarted, and in 2005 the youth squads moved to the grounds, with the first-squad hotel being finished in 2006, the same year in which the facility was officially inaugurated by club president Ricardo Annes Guimar√£es. The name \\"Cidade do Galo\\" was unofficially adopted in 2005, being registered in the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial in 2007. In 2008, Cidade do Galo hosted the Brazil national football team in preparation for a match against Argentina in Belo Horizonte, and in May 2010, a research conducted by Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa and SporTV, which evaluated human resources, material resources, physical facilities and logistics, elected Cidade do Galo as the best training facility in Brazil. In 2014, the facility hosted the Argentine national team that finished second place in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and in the same year Eurosport selected Cidade do Galo as one of the five best football training grounds in the world, the only one outside of Europe. Facilities The complex, which has a built area of 5,850 square metres and a total area of 244,460 square metres, includes four official size football pitches, a first-class hotel for first-squad players and youth academy with 20 suites, gaming room, restaurant, auditorium, panoramic deck and industrial kitchen, phisiology room, medical and dentistry departments, climatized lockrooms with hydrotherapy tubs, gym, spa pools, ice tank, 7-a-side football pitch and laundry room. The Press Room has a view to the main training pitch and includes multimedia resources and infrastructure for media professionals.

History The company was founded as Libby, McNeill & Libby in Chicago, Illinois, by Archibald McNeill and the brothers Arthur and Charles Libby. The business began with a canned meat product, beef in brine, or corned beef. The product became well-known when the company began to package the meat in a trapezoid-shaped can starting in 1875. By 1880, it had 1,500 employees in Chicago. Libby, McNeill & Libby was acquired by Nestl√© in 1970. Nestl√© introduced Juicy Juice in 1977 and it was branded under the Libby's name. In 2006, Nestl√© began to market Juicy Juice. In 2014, the Juicy Juice brand and business was sold by Nestl√© to Harvest Hill Beverage Company, a portfolio company of Brynwood Partners. In 1982, Libby's canned vegetable business was acquired by S.S. Pierce Company (now Seneca Foods) and its canned fruits business was acquired by California Canners and Growers (Cal Can). In 1984, Cal Can merged with Tri-Valley Growers. In 2000, Tri-Valley Growers went bankrupt and the bulk of its operations, including the rights to the Libby's canned fruit business, was acquired by Signature Fruit LLC in 2001. In 2006, Seneca Foods acquired Signature Fruit. Niagara Trading Company (now NTC Marketing, Inc.) acquired a long-term license for the Libby's name for canned pineapple and juices in 1983. In 1998, Libby's canned meat business was sold by Nestl√© to International Home Foods. In 2000, International Home Foods was acquired by ConAgra. In 2006, Nestl√© sold the Libby's trademark to a Swiss entity that became known as Libby Brand Holding. In 2010, Walton & Post, Inc. acquired a long-term license under the Libby's name for several items, including nectars, creamers, and prepared meals. Advertising In the 1970s, Libby's had a successful television advertising campaign featuring their jingle, \\"When it says Libby's Libby's Libby's on the label, label, label, you will like it, like it, like it, on your table, table, table.\\" Operations Before and after World War II, Libby's had canning operations outside the United States in Belgium and France, at Leer in northern Germany, and in the United Kingdom. In 2015 Peaty Mills plc. acquired the Libby‚Äôs brand rights for preserved foods in the UK, Ireland and Portugal with the exceptions of Corned Beef, Pumpkin and Fruit Juices. The brand rights for Fruit Juice in the UK are held by Refresco. Libby's trademark in Canary Islands, Spain and Portugal is licensed to Establecimientos Industriales Archipi√©lago S.A. Libby's Pork and Beans ad, 1905 =2009 canned pumpkin shortage= In November 2009, Libby's announced that because of poor weather on its Illinois pumpkin farms and a depleted back stock, a canned pumpkin shortage was likely as Thanksgiving approached. Libby's accounts for the vast majority of canned pumpkin production in the United States, and the shortfall prompted Libby's to establish farms in multiple states as a hedge against another mass shortage like the one that happened in 2009.

The brand was purchased in 1990 from Beatrice Foods by ConAgra Foods during the LBO firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' dismantling of the company and is still currently a property of ConAgra. Early history The company was founded in 1922 by Dr. Ilhan New (Ïú†ÏùºÌïú), later founder of Yuhan Corporation in South Korea, and Wally Smith from the University of Michigan. The first product, canned mung bean sprouts, was originally sold in Smith's Detroit, Michigan, grocery store.La Choy at ConAgra Foods New left the company for personal reasons in 1930, and Smith was killed by lightning in 1937. Regardless, the company flourished. By the late 1930s, management at the firm had developed a comprehensive line of food products, including bean sprouts, soy sauce, subgum, kumquats, water chestnuts, brown sauce, bamboo shoots, and chow mein noodles. The company had capitalized on the growing fascination Americans had with East Asia, including an entirely different type of cuisine. In 1937, the company built its first manufacturing facility in Detroit, featuring of production space. To reduce overhead costs and maintain profitability during World War II, management decided to relocate the company from its facility in Detroit about to Archbold, Ohio. Selling its Detroit plant to the federal government for the production of munitions, the proceeds from the sale enabled the company to start a new era in its history. On June 23, 1957, three principals of the La Choy company, all from Archbold, appeared as contestants on the TV panel show What's My Line. As all three men had Irish surnames (McDonough, Muldoon and McCarthy), they managed to stump the panel. Marketing and advertising A popular advertising jingle from the 1970s included the slogan \\"LaChoy makes Chinese food swing American.\\" =Muppets= Early in his career, Jim Henson created a series of television commercials from 1965-1967 featuring a Full-Bodied Muppet character called Delbert the La Choy Dragon (performed by Frank Oz and voiced by Jim Henson) which used the catchphrase \\"quick cooked in dragon fire\\" to describe the product. Delbert was accompanied in later commercials by a timid character named Mert (performed by Jim Henson). Delbert was one of Oz's few full-bodied Muppet performances, since he didn't like performing in their costumes.

He was born in 1965 in Grenoble, France. He teaches video and coordinates the digital media department at the Ecole nationale des Beaux-arts de Lyon.  Distribution and awards  Olivier Zabat's films are shown in theaters, on television (Arte), in contemporary art exhibitions and in international documentary and film festivals, in particular in the avant-garde and experimental sections. Zabat has received the Villa Medicis Hors les Murs award twice, once in the Art category and once in Video which enabled him to film in Brazil. In 2001, Zona Oeste was shown at the International Film Festival Rotterdam (Netherlands), in the main short film category, but also at the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis (U.S.A.) and the following year at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen (Germany). In 2002, Miguel et les Mines was presented at the Entrevues Belfort Film Festival (France) after its first showing as an installation at the ARC, City of Paris' Museum of Modern Art and in the exhibition ¬´ the History of Modern Conflict ¬ª at the Imperial War Museum in London (UK). In 2004, he received the Grand Prix of the French Competition at the International Documentary Film Festival Marseilles (France) for 1/3 of the eyes which was ranked one of the top ten films of 2005 by the Cahiers du Cin√©ma. The same year, he participated in the international contemporary art exhibition Manifesta 5 in San Sebastian, the exhibition \\"Unique But Not the Only: French Contemporary Art\\" at the Guangdong Museum of Art (China) and the event \\"The Government\\" in Vienna (Austria) and Miami (U.S.A). In 2006, he participated in the International Film Festival Prague (Czech Republic); his short film Don‚Äôt touch me has been shown in various art spaces, including the South London Gallery and the Bischoff Weiss Gallery (UK). In 2008, his film Yves was shown on the channel Arte on the program La Lucarne. Zabat's film Fading was selected for the Orizzonti competition in the 67th Venice International Film Festival in 2010 and for the Cinema of the Future Competition at BAFICI, the Buenos Aires International Independent Film Festival (Argentina) in 2011. His work was also shown in ‚ÄúArt in the 21st Century, Day for Night1‚Äì Between Reality and Illusion‚Äù at the Community University in New York. His film Basement perspective was in competition at the Locarno Film Festival (Switzerland) in 2012, in the Corti d'artista section. In September 2013, he showed three video installations at the Lofoten International Art Festival (Norway) and in November 2013, his latest film Silent Minutes was selected for competition in the CinemaXXI section of the Rome Film Festival (Italy). Olivier Zabat had an exhibition of his new works at the Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain of Lyon in March‚ÄìJune 2017, named \\"The noise\\". In 2019, his film Arguments has been selected at the Locarno Film Festival (Switzerland), official selection Fuori Concorso, was shown at the French Cinemath√®que of Paris for its French avant-premi√®re and took part to the Doc Fortnight 2020 of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of New York (USA).  Axes of work  At the basis of Zabat's work is a reflection on the forms taken by, and issues surrounding, contemporary representation of reality at once as the foundation of the artistic process, but also as human experience and a sociological and political marker. Since 1996 he has been entirely committed to an artistic approach involving an independent exploration in film, which favors video over photography, because he prefers ‚Äúmetamorphosis to fixing‚Äù. Olivier Zabat works on the image during the filming process with protagonists in difficult situations, sometimes even in situations of individual or collective crisis: mourning, illness, combat, accident, handicap, conflict, exclusion, criminality, war... In these situations means of resistance, resilience, and preservation of individual integrity come sharply to the fore, as do the problematics inherent in representation, such as incommunicability, anonymity, the unrepresentable, obscurity, blindness, ineffability and invisibility. In all of his films, both the participants and Zabat himself are trying to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and transmit their vision to viewers. From his first film on, Olivier Zabat has been interested in the founding principles and evolutions of the cinema and of means of representation in general. He explores different forms of communication and cinematographic narration, but also the relationships people have with their own image in a culture profoundly influenced by cinema, television, and new images.Olivier Zabat, interview with Alfonso Camacho. 2012.

The NAA also helps to foster alumni-to- alumni connections through networking and mentoring opportunities, as well as provides regional, international, and affinity clubs, educational programs, young alumni chapters, and more. History The NAA was founded in 1881, when the newly founded Alumni Association hosted the University's first Alumni Day on June 22. The NAA made great progress in its mission to connect Northwestern alumni with their alma mater in the years that followed, overseeing the growth of alumni clubs across the nation, publishing its first alumni newsletter, and establishing many traditions still celebrated by students and alumni alike. The NAA is governed by the NAA Board of Directors, a nationwide organization which consists of Wildcat alumni leaders who represent Northwestern alumni from every undergraduate, graduate, and professional school at the University. The current president of the NAA is Kathryn Mlsna, who serves as the principal executive officer of the Association. Mlsna also directs the duties of the other officers, chairs the executive committee, and serves as an ex-officio member of all standing committees of the Association. The NAA also has nine standing and ad hoc committees. These committees seek to connect fellow Northwestern alumni and to contribute to the larger goals of the NAA. Standing committees focus on areas of annual giving, board membership and volunteer development, career and networking, clubs, engagement, global connection, and leadership development and education. Two ad hoc committees, the Long Range Planning Ad Hoc Committee and the Mentoring Ad Hoc Committee, also support the NAA. The NAA's Alumni Regents are ex-officio directors of the NAA and act as ambassadors of the University for their own geographic regions. These Alumni Regents are appointed by the University president and, as such, communicate the policies and directions of Northwestern as explained by the president, represent the president at events or inaugurations in their region, and act in an advisory capacity to NU Clubs. Today, the NAA serves an alumni base of approximately 200,000 Wildcats through a wide variety of events and programs and seeks to help Northwestern alumni strengthen their relationship with the University and fellow Wildcats. Traditions Since the founding of the NAA, the organization has worked to strengthen and celebrate the unique bond between the University and its alumni. The NAA works to show the spirit of this unique bond in some of its oldest traditions. =Alumni Awards= The NAA, for more than eight decades, has carried on the tradition of honoring alumni who have distinguished themselves with outstanding professional and personal achievements and those who have loyally dedicated their time and service to Northwestern. These individuals are recognized for their accomplishments each year. Awards are given to alumni for a wide variety of reasons. The Alumni Medal, the highest award granted by the NAA, ‚Äúis given to an alumnus/a who combines superior professional distinction and/or exemplary volunteer service to society with an outstanding record of service to the University.‚Äù Awards also recognize loyal service rendered voluntarily to the University, alumni who have distinguished themselves in professions or fields of endeavor in ways that reflect credit on Northwestern, voluntary efforts of alumni which contribute to the improvement of society, and alumni who have made significant impacts on their professions or communities since graduation. The NAA also presents the Grant Goodrich Achievement Award to one outstanding individual who is not a graduate of Northwestern but has enhances the University through their professional accomplishments, commitment, and service. =Reunions= Since 1884, the NAA has hosted Reunion and Homecoming Weekend for thousands of Northwestern alumni. Reunions provide alumni opportunities for ‚Äúreconnecting, reminiscing, and cheering on the ‚ÄôCats!‚Äù Reunion activities include an All-Class Tailgate, a Homecoming football game, a Student and Alumni Homecoming Reception, and a Homecoming Barbeque. =Leadership Symposium= NAA has hosted an annual Leadership Symposium since 1964. This Symposium offers alumni leaders from across the country the chance to ‚Äúcollaborate, renew skills, build and deepen networks, and recognize the outstanding accomplishments of fellow alumni.‚Äù The Symposium typically features a mix of workshops, keynote speakers, volunteer recognition, and time to connect with fellow alumni while exploring campus. =Our Northwestern= In 2014, the NAA launched Our Northwestern, an exclusive space where Northwestern students, alumni, and faculty members can gather. Users are able to find friends and classmates through the online directory system, share memories with classmates, network with fellow users both socially and professionally, and engage in interesting discussions with peers.

In the summer of 1979, he organized a patrol, the Klan Border Watch, to capture illegal Mexican immigrants south of Fallbrook, California. Metzger's Klan organization also had a security force which was involved in confrontations with Communists and anti-Klan protesters. Metzger's branch of the Klan split with Duke's organization in 1980 to form the California Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\\"The Real David Duke,\\" Newsweek, November 18, 1991, Pg. 24 Also in 1979, he took Greg Withrow of the White Student Union \\"under his wing\\", which later became the Aryan Youth Movement (AYM), for youth associated with White Aryan Resistance. In 1985, Metzger attended a Nation of Islam rally in San Diego, led by Louis Farrakhan. During the rally, he compared America to a \\"rotting carcass\\" and praised Farrakhan for \\"understanding\\" that Jews are \\"living off the carcass\\" and called them \\"parasites.\\"  Views  According to Steven Atkins, author of The Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism in Modern American History, Metzger's ideology \\"differs from other white supremacists by rejecting the basic tenets of the Christian Identity movement because he considers himself to be the champion of the Third Position. The Third Position is a form of racism that is oriented towards attracting the white working class and it is also anti-capitalist in orientation. Metzger believes that the United States should be divided into designated areas for different racial groups except Asian Americans, who should be expelled from the United States.\\" In 1988 Metzger, recorded this message on his WAR Hotline: > You have reached WAR Hotline. White Aryan Resistance. You ask: What is WAR? > We are an openly white-racist movement‚ÄîSkinheads, we welcome you into our > ranks. The federal government is the number one enemy of our race. When was > the last time you heard a politician speaking out in favor of white people? > [...] You say the government is too big; we can‚Äôt organize. Well, by God, > the SS did it in Germany, and if they did it in Germany in the thirties, we > can do it right here in the streets of America. We need to cleanse this > nation of all nonwhite mud-races for the survival of our own people and the > generations of our children. White Aryan Resistance In 1982 he left the Klan to found a new group, the White American Political Association, a group dedicated to promoting \\"prowhite\\" candidates for office. After losing the 1982 California Senate Democratic primary, Metzger abandoned the electoral route and reorganized WAPA as White American Resistance in 1983 and then reorganized it as White Aryan Resistance, to reflect a more \\"revolutionary\\" stance.Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing inc. 1991 pp.92, 387Anti-Defamation League Danger: Extremism; the major voices and vehicles on America far right fringe New York; Anti-Defamation League 1996 pp.77-8 In 1985 Metzger was invited to speak at a rally of the Nation of Islam. Despite Metzger's open racism towards blacks, the two groups found common ground based on their desire for racial separation and their hatred of Jewish people. Metzger donated $100 to the Nation of Islam. Metzger made numerous television appearances in addition to hosting his own cable TV public-access television show, Race and Reason. In one of his first cable episodes, Metzger invited the gothic rock band Radio Werewolf onto the show, during which a confused Metzger was given an honorary membership in the band. In November 1988, his son John appeared on an episode of the Geraldo show in which a brawl broke out and Geraldo Rivera's nose was broken. Metzger also appeared on the Wally George Hot Seat show with Irv Rubin, the chairman of the Jewish Defense League, in what was a very contentious debate. The debate ended when Rubin threw water in the face of Metzger. Security intervened and the Anaheim Police were called. The debate was considered unusual for George's program who typically brought in liberal guests that argued with Wally. Since both guests were extreme, George essentially served as a moderator. Wally despised the racist nationalism by Metzger even though Metzger of the two was the obvious right wing guest. Oregon civil trial The group was eventually bankrupted as the result of a civil lawsuit centered on its involvement in the 1988 murder of Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian man who had moved to the United States to attend college. In 1988, white power skinheads affiliated with WAR were convicted of killing Seraw and sent to prison. Kenneth Mieske said he and the two others killed Seraw \\"because of his race.\\" Metzger declared that they did a \\"civic duty\\" by killing Seraw. Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit against him, arguing that WAR influenced Seraw's killers by encouraging their group East Side White Pride to commit violence. Metzger's decision to represent himself at his trial became the source of considerable civic derision through the legal incompetence which he displayed‚Äînever more so than when he accepted an option for a new trial judge during the initial stages of the trial in place of the interim appointed judge whom he thought was Jewish; only after he had made his decision did he discover that the new judge, Ancer L. Haggerty, was African American. At the trial, WAR national vice president Dave Mazzella testified about how the Metzgers instructed WAR members to commit violence against minorities. Tom and his son John Metzger were found civilly liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability, in which one can be liable for a tort committed by a subordinate or another person who is taking instructions. The jury returned the largest civil verdict in Oregon history at the time‚Äî$12.5 million‚Äîagainst Metzger and WAR. The Metzgers' house was seized, and most of WAR's profits go to paying off the judgment. Post-Oregon trial After the trial, Metzger's home was transferred to Seraw's estate for $121,500, while Metzger was allowed to keep $45,000 under California's Homestead Act. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League came up with the $45,000 needed to pay Metzger for the home. Metzger was warned that any damages left in the house would result in a lawsuit, and while he left it in \\"a mess\\" with cracked windows, there was no serious damage. As a result of the sale of his home, he was forced to move into an apartment. In May 1991, Metzger agreed to stop selling T-shirts of Bart Simpson in a Nazi uniform with the words \\"Pure Nazi Dude\\" and \\"Total Nazi Dude\\". In 1991 he was convicted of burning a cross in 1983, and sentenced to six months in prison and 300 hours of community service by working with minorities. He was released from prison 45 days into his sentence so he could be with his critically ill wife.\\"Klan leader let out of jail to be with critically ill wife,\\" The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec), February 22, 1992 In 1992, Metzger and his son John violated a court order not to leave the country and entered Canada to speak to the Heritage Front. Soon afterwards, he was arrested for violating Canadian immigration laws by entering the country to \\"promote racial hatred\\".\\"White Aryan leaders deported Jewish groups applaud decision,\\" The Globe and Mail July 3, 1992 With his son John, Metzger was jailed for five days for breaking Canadian immigration laws as he had done so \\"to promote race hatred\\". Since the early 1990s, Metzger has advocated the \\"lone wolf\\" method of organization, of which there are many, for white nationalist groups, which states that a person should not outwardly display his/her racist ideology, but must act covertly. In 2003, Metzger appeared in Louis and the Nazis, a documentary made by Louis Theroux. Metzger moved to Warsaw, Indiana at some point in the mid-2000s. In 2004, he was the subject in an online article from a San Diego-based periodical that outlined his love of karaoke, sparse white activist action, and bemused feelings over the state of his hoped-for white revolution. On June 2, 2009, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raided Metzger's home. No arrests were made and no information was released on what was found inside his house. Metzger was allowed to leave the premises during the search and stated that address books, compact discs, tapes and computers were seized in the raid. This was connected with two arrested brothers accused of a mail bomb attack injuring a diversity director in Arizona. Metzger is still mandated to make payments to Seraw's family. Metzger now hosts an Internet radio talk show. Metzger no longer resides in Warsaw, IN, having moved back to California. Mainstream party politics Metzger changed political parties several times and sometimes created his own. In 1980, he won the Democratic Party nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives with over 40,000 votes in a San Diego-area district. This forced the Democratic Party to completely disavow his candidacy, and take the unusual step of endorsing his opponent, Republican Clair Burgener. Metzger lost by over 200,000 votes in November 1980 to a several-term incumbent in a heavily Republican district. In 1982 he sought the Democratic Party's senatorial nomination again, running against then-Governor Jerry Brown and author Gore Vidal, winning only 76,000 votes (2.8% of the vote) in the primary. In 2010, Metzger took out an advertisement in the Warsaw Times-Union, in order to announce his intention to challenge, as an independent, U.S. Representative Mark Souder, a Republican from Indiana's 3rd congressional district. \\"I'd go to Washington and get into Congress, and have a fistfight every day,\\" Metzger told a local news station.New York Daily News, \\"Ex-Klu (sic) Klux Klan leader and white supremacist uses ad to run for Congress,\\" by Michael Sheridan (March 9, 2010 - retrieved on March 10, 2010). Metzger did not make it into the ballot for the election, which was ultimately won by Republican Marlin Stutzman. =Electoral history= References Further reading *Morris Dees.

He first gained notice with the release of his acclaimed debut studio album, Endtroducing...... He has a personal collection of more than 60,000 records. Biography =Early years (1989‚Äì1995)= DJ Shadow was experimenting with a four-track recorder while in high school in Davis, California (suburb of Sacramento metropolitan area) and began his music career as a disc jockey for the University of California, Davis campus radio station KDVS. During this period he was significant in developing the experimental hip-hop style associated with the London-based Mo' Wax record label. His early singles, including \\"In/Flux\\" and \\"Lost and Found (S.F.L.)\\", were genre-bending, merging elements of funk, rock, hip hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records. Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, described the single ‚ÄúIn/Flux‚Äù as \\"trip hop,\\" a term that had already been attached to Bristol, England-based groups Massive Attack and Portishead and the Bristol scene in general in June 1994. He has cited Kurtis Mantronik, Steinski, and Prince Paul as influences on his sample- based sound, further claiming that \\"lyrics (...) were confining, too specific.\\" His music rarely features more than short clips of voices or vocal work. During 1991‚Äì1992, DJ Shadow remixes were released on Hollywood BASIC, a short-lived rap/hip-hop subsidiary label of Hollywood Records. Notable amongst these is a 1992 compilation release titled \\"BASIC Beats Sampler\\", which features a remix of \\"The Real Deal\\", a song by Lifers Group, as well as a 12-plus-minute \\"Mega Mix\\" of the rest of the album, including tracks by west- coast underground hip-hop act, Raw Fusion and east-coast acts, Organized Konfusion and Zimbabwe Legit. Also in 1992, Shadow contributed scratching and production work to Sleeping with the Enemy, the controversial second release by rapper Paris. Early in 1993, Shadow was a part of the creation of the Solesides underground hip-hop label, in conjunction with Blackalicious and Lyrics Born (whose stage name at the time was Asia Born). The first 12\\" release on this new imprint was titled \\"Entropy,\\" with the A-side containing the Asia Born track \\"Send Them\\" and a dub rendition of the DJ Shadow track \\"Count and Estimate,\\" and the entire B-side consisting of the 17-plus-minute title track. Rapper Gift of Gab is featured in the version of \\"Count and Estimate\\" that appears in Entropy. Shadow continued to participate in releases on the Solesides label for years to come, until the label was disbanded in favor of Quannum Projects. Also in 1993, Mo' Wax's James Lavelle contacted Shadow about releasing \\"In/Flux\\" on the fledgling imprint. The association with Mo' Wax was a productive one; his tracks \\"In/Flux\\" and \\"Lost and Found\\" made their way onto some releases over the next few years. Shadow also worked with DJ Krush during this period. On a 1995 visit to the Mo' Wax Studios in London, England, Shadow was recruited to perform scratches on a James Lavelle and Tim Goldsworthy mix of the Massive Attack song \\"Karmacoma\\". = Endtroducing....., UNKLE and Scratch (1996‚Äì2001) = Shadow's first full- length work, Endtroducing....., was released in late 1996 to critical acclaim. Endtroducing would go on to make the Guinness World Records book for \\"First Completely Sampled Album\\" in 2001. The only pieces of equipment Shadow used to produce the album were the AKAI MPC60 12-bit sampling drum machine, a pair of turntables and a borrowed-by-visiting Pro Tools setup from an early adopter of the technology, Dan \\"The Automator\\" Nakamura. In November 2006 Time magazine named it one of its \\"All-Time\\" 100 best albums. In November 2014, automobile maker Chevrolet used a sample \\"Building Steam with a Grain of Salt\\" in a Chevy commercial. In 1998 Shadow released Preemptive Strike, a compilation of 1993‚Äì1997 singles released on Mo' Wax. Later that year, he produced Psyence Fiction, the debut album by UNKLE, a long-time Mo' Wax production team that featured guest appearances including Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (The Verve), Mike D (Beastie Boys), Kool G. Rap, and Jason Newsted (Metallica). Around 2000 he produced the score for the documentary Dark Days filmed by British director Marc Singer. This film is about a community of transients who live underground in a subway tunnel. It has six award wins in various competitions. Shadow also starred in the 2001 movie Scratch, produced by Doug Pray, alongside Z-Trip, Grand Wizard Theodore, Mix Master Mike and DJ Qbert. He makes multiple appearances during the turntable and digging sections of the movie. = The Private Press and Live! In Tune and on Time (2002‚Äì2005) = Nearly six years after his debut production album, his second album, The Private Press, was released in June 2002. A video for his track \\"Six Days\\" was also released in 2002, directed by Wong Kar-wai. In protest against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, DJ Shadow collaborated with Zack de la Rocha, releasing the song \\"March of Death\\" online for free. In 2004, Shadow's first feature-length DVD, Live! In Tune and on Time, was released. It features a live performance in London that combines tracks and samples from past albums as well as his work with UNKLE and Quannum, and emphasizes visuals, with the help of Bay Area projection artist Ben Stokes. = The Outsider and Diminishing Returns (2006‚Äì2009) = In 2006, he signed a deal with Universal Records, on which would be released The Outsider, on September 18. A special edition CD box set was also released containing The Outsider, the album on CD and a DVD entitled Tour Visuals. This album, which prominently featured several artists from the local San Francisco Bay Area hyphy hip hop movement, got a mixed welcome among Shadow's fans. Responding to criticisms, the DJ/producer explained on his blog why he made no apologies: \\"Repeat Endtroducing over and over again? That was never, ever in the game plan. Fuck that. So I think it's time for certain fans to decide if they are fans of the album, or the artist.\\" Throughout 2007 and 2008, DJ Shadow toured with fellow DJ Cut Chemist in support of their The Hard Sell mixtape, released in January 2007 and recorded during the reheasals of a June 2007 show. The duo had already produced several mixtapes in the past, most notably Brainfreeze and Product Placement, mixing jazz, funk, and soul. The were joined by Kid Koala, and the rehearsals of this tour spawned The Hard Sell (Encore), a \\"refined\\" version of the duo's set. Diminishing Returns was a 2-hour DJ Mix originally broadcast on BBC Radio 1 on March 29, 2003. It was released in 2003 on CD in a pressing limited to 1000 copies on the Reconstruction Productions label. On April 1, 2009, DJ Shadow announced on his Facebook page that he was working on a Diminishing Returns re-release. Reconstruction Productions reissued the album in 2009 with a sticker stating \\"official, last chance limited edition, re-release\\". =The Less You Know, the Better (2010‚Äì2013)= During Shadow's Outsider 2007 tour, he was spotted filming with Dean Fernando (aka \\"DINO\\") as reported on Shadow/Quannum fansite Solesides. On March 7, 2009, Shadow announced that he was working on new music. Though no release date was given, he assured, \\"It will sound different from the last one.\\" In September 2010, DJ Shadow released a single with two tracks called \\"Def Surrounds Us\\" and \\"I've Been Trying\\" and taken from the new album as a preview. While on the 2010 \\"Shadowsphere\\" tour new songs began to emerge, although he stated that a new album was not yet ready and that he would continue working toward having it ready in time for his 2011 tour. On May 10, 2011, Shadow confirmed via his Facebook page and official website that his new album, titled The Less You Know, the Better, was finished and that it would be released the following September on Verve/Universal. The same day, he also released an EP called I Gotta Rokk featuring remixed tracks from the forthcoming album. A second single \\"I'm Excited\\" was also released, featuring Afrikan Boy, on July 7, 2011. However the single was pulled because of copyright infringement. The infringement also delayed the album's release. Another song from the album, titled \\"Warning Call,\\" featuring Tom Vek, was released on 7 September 2011, and was featured as a free download on the official DJ Shadow Facebook page. Shadow announced on September 30, 2011 via Twitter that The Less You Know, the Better would be released on a 3xUSB format. The artwork for this album, the associated singles and promotional material was done by Tony Papesh, an artist from San Francisco, California. The album was mixed by Jim Abbiss. =Liquid Amber (2014‚Äì2015)= On August 12, 2014, Shadow launched his new record label imprint Liquid Amber, releasing The Liquid Amber EP for streaming in accompaniment. Other acts signed to Liquid Amber include Bleep Bloop, Noer the Boy, Mophono, and Ruckazoid. In April 2015, a group called Nite School Klik released a single called \\"Posse\\" on Liquid Amber. In May 2015, Shadow revealed to Billboard that the group was in fact himself and trap producer G Jones working together. The first self- titled EP by Nite School Klik was released on June 9, 2015. = The Mountain Will Fall and The Mountain Has Fallen (2016‚Äì2018) = In April 2016 Shadow announced a new album entitled The Mountain Will Fall, which was released on June 24 via Mass Appeal Records. A music video for the album's lead single, \\"Nobody Speak,\\" featuring rap duo Run the Jewels, was released on August 24, 2016. In collaboration with a Los Angeles record store, Shadow held on September 10‚Äì11, 2016 the \\"First Annual DJ Shadow Storage Sale,\\" selling duplicates in his collection, and limited editions of his \\"The Sideshow\\" track. It has been an annual event since then and ran until 2019. On April 20, 2017, a new collaboration between Shadow and Nas named \\"Systematic\\" premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show. The song was revealed to be part of HBO's Silicon Valley soundtrack. Later that year, in June, Shadow released the The Mountain Has Fallen EP, featuring \\"Systematic\\" and \\"Horror Show,\\" a new single featuring Danny Brown. 2018 saw the release of Live in Manchester: The Moutain Has Fallen, a nine-track live album recorded at Manchester's Albert Hall on October 5, 2017, as Shadow was touring in support of his previous album and EP. = Our Pathetic Age (2019‚Äìpresent) = On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed DJ Shadow among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. He later announced a double album entitled Our Pathetic Age that was released November 15, 2019. This two- part release includes an instrumental section and a vocal suite, featuring returning collaborators Run the Jewels and Nas, and artists such as Ghostface Killah, De La Soul, and Raekwon. Shadow was approached by Deftones to contribute to their White Pony 20th anniversary re-issue remix project, Black Stallion. Singer Chino Moreno explained that they originally wanted him to remix the whole album, citing him as an inspiration at the time they recorded it. He ended up remixing \\"Digital Bath\\", alongside other confirmed producers such as Trevor Jackson and Clams Casino. Studio and equipment The book Behind the Beat documents Shadow's home studio (named \\"Reconstruction\\") through photos and a brief description (as of 2005). It is \\"nestled within a leafy San Francisco suburb\\" and Shadow apparently moved to the area \\"to be closer to the local record store\\". It also states that \\"Shadow only keeps a small selection of vinyl at home with the rest occupying storage units around town\\". His equipment as of 2005, according to Behind the Beat, consists of two Akai MPC 3000s and a Korg Triton. His album Endtroducing was \\"created on an AKAI MPC60 and an ADAT\\". Sampling DJ Shadow's work involves manipulating samples, taking rare and seldom-heard pieces of music and reworking them into parts and phrases for his songs. Many of his tracks feature dozens of samples from a wide array of styles and influences including rock, soul, funk, experimental, electronic and jazz. Shadow famously sampled American composer David Axelrod on his collaboration with DJ Krush, \\"Duality\\", sampling Axelrod's \\"The Warnings\\" (Part 1). The piano in \\"Midnight in a Perfect World\\" from 1996's Endtroducing was originally recorded for Pekka Pohjola's \\"Sekoilu seestyy.\\" Although Shadow currently uses fewer samples than on his earlier albums, several examples feature on his 2006 album The Outsider. His collaboration with David Banner, \\"Seein' Thangs\\", features a synthesizer and vocals from Cecilia's \\"Crimson Red\\" and \\"Outsider Intro\\" includes an excerpt from Ron Geesin's \\"Concrete Line Up\\" from the 1973 album, As He Stands.

The Peter Blum print edition projects range from single print to traditional portfolio to installation specific portfolio editions. The book projects are all limited edition and range from artist monographs to historical surveys to special editions that include original prints. The Peter Blum Edition Archive has been exhibited twice in museums. The first museum exhibition was titled Singular Multiples: The Peter Blum Edition Archive, 1980-1994 in 2006 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston located in Houston, Texas. It has been noted as the largest exhibition in North America devoted entirely to printmaking. On the occasion of this exhibition a book of the same title was published by the museum. Soon after the exhibition in Houston, a selection of the edition archive was exhibited overseas at the Aargauer Kunsthaus in Aarau, Switzerland in 2007. The exhibition was titled Scenes and Sequences: Peter Blum Edition, New York and was also accompanied by a book of the same title published by the Aargauer Kunsthaus.

Martini (1886‚Äì1984) was an American architect who was a member of the second generation of women architects in Chicago. She was the first woman to be the sole owner of an architectural firm in Chicago, and she founded the Chicago Drafting Club, one of the first organizations for women architects and a precursor of the Women's Architectural Club founded by Juliet Peddle and Bertha Yerex Whitman. Early life and education Not a great deal is known about Martini's family or formative years. She was born in Brooklyn in 1886 and went to high school in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. She got her architectural training at the Pratt Institute in 1908 and also took some courses at Columbia University. After some travels in Europe, she moved to Chicago in 1909. Architectural career Martini was initially rejected by some ninety firms in her search for architectural work, on at least two occasions because the firms refused to have women in their drafting rooms. She then changed her approach: she went to business school and obtained a secretarial job at an architectural firm, a position she leveraged to shift into drafting. She ended up working as a draughtsperson for a number of Chicago-area architects including John B. Sutcliffe, who specialized in churches. In 1913, when she took and passed her Illinois licensing exam, she was the only woman of the 86 applicants; and, following the departure of Marion Mahony Griffin in 1914, she would for some years be the only woman architect licensed in private practice by the state of Illinois. Martini opened her own office in 1914, becoming the first woman who was sole owner of an architectural firm in Chicago. The bulk of her work was commissions for residences, but she would also do rush work for other local architects. Her largest commission was a 1928 church complex, St. Luke's Lutheran in Park Ridge, Illinois, the design of which is an adaptation of English Gothic architecture. In lieu of a flat fee, Martini received $60 a month for life. In 1921, Martini put an ad in a paper reading: \\"Only girl architect lonely. Wanted‚Äîto meet all the women architects in Chicago to form a club.\\" Out of this came the Chicago Drafting Club, which later merged with the Women's Architectural Club, which in turn merged with the still-extant organization Chicago Women in Architecture. In 1934, Martini moved her architectural practice to Bangor, Michigan, and became a member of the American Institute of Architects. Martini died in Pleasant Hill, Tennessee, at the age of 98.

It contains a single species, Pseudochampsa ischigualastensis, originally named as a second species of the closely related Chanaresuchus, based on a fairly complete articulated skeleton and skull.Trotteyn et al., 2012 A revision of the remains concluded that it was best to move to species to its own genus, as no traits were found to unite P. ischigualastensis and the type species of Chanaresuchus to the exclusion of other proterochampsids. A phylogenetic analysis places both species in a polytomy with Gualosuchus as the most advanced members of Proterochampsia.Trotteyn & Ezcurra, 2014  Discovery  Skull in multiple views Pseudochampsa is known solely from the holotype PVSJ 567, a nearly complete and articulated individual housed at the Divisi√≥n de Paleontologia de Vertebrados del Museo de Ciencias Naturales y Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Argentina. The holotype consists of a skull with fully occluded lower jaws, a complete vertebral column lacking the outer half of the tail, several neck and back ribs, some haemal arches, some gastralia, the pectoral girdle, both partially preserved humeri, a partial pelvic girdle, and both nearly complete hind-limbs including both femora, tibiae, fibulae, tarsals and feet. PVSJ 567 was found at Valle Pintado, Hoyada de Ischigualasto of the Ischigualasto Provincial Park, San Juan Province. It was collected from the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation, of Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin, dating to the late Carnian to earliest Norian stages of the middle Late Triassic.  Etymology  The type species of Pseudochampsa was first described and named by Mar√≠a J. Trotteyn, Ricardo N. Mart√≠nez and Oscar A. Alcober in 2012, as a second species of Chanaresuchus, C. ischigualastensis. The specific name refers to the Ischigualasto Formation that yielded the holotype and only known specimen, with the Greek suffix -ensis, meaning \\"from\\". Trotteyn and Mart√≠n D. Ezcurra reassigned the species to its own genus in 2014, naming Pseudochampsa and creating the new combination Pseudochampsa ischigualastensis. The new generic name is derived from Greek pseudo, meaning \\"false\\", and champsa, meaning \\"crocodile\\", and refers to the crocodile-like body morphology of P. ischigualastensis.  Description  Life reconstruction of Pseudochampsa ischigualastensis The type species of Pseudochampsa was originally thought to be a member of Chanaresuchus. Trotteyn et al. (2012) referred this species to Chanaresuchus and diagnosed Chanaresuchus based on the presence of cranial ornamentation by longitudinal crests and depressions on the upper surfaces of the premaxillae, maxillae and nasal bones, a side fossa on the centrum of the presacral vertebrae, a low deltopectoral crest on the humerus, and the absence of a fifth toe. However, Trotteyn and Ezcurra (2014) revised these supposed synapomorphies of Chanaresuchus and found them to represent synapomorphies of larger clades. Cranial ornamentation of this form as seen in Chanaresuchus bonapartei and P. ischigualastensis is also present in Gualosuchus reigi and Rhadinosuchus gracilis. The shallow weakly-rimmed depression of the presacral centra in these species is also shared with Tropidosuchus romeri, G. reigi and R. gracilis. The low deltopectoral crest on the humerus is present in all known proterochampsids to the exclusion of R. gracilis, in which it is unknown, and Proterochampsa barrionuevoi. Finally, at least one other proterochampsid apart from C. bonapartei and P. ischigualastensis is known to lack a fifth toe - T. romeri. The three established autapomorphies of C. bonapartei by Dilkes and Arcucci (2012), are either unknown in P. ischigualastensis or known to differ from it. In fact, two out of the three autapomorphies (a deep well-defined depression in front of the nostril, and an elongated oval supratemporal fenestrae with a back-side directed main axis) are absent in P. ischigualastensis, in which this depression is shallow like in G. reigi, and the supratemporal fenestra is near-triangular and aligned with the long axis of the skull. Thus, Trotteyn and Ezcurra (2014) found no synapomorphies that unite C. bonapartei and P. ischigualastensis exclusively, or support their monophyly within Chanaresuchus, requiring a new generic name for \\"C.\\" ischigualastensis. The phylogenetic analysis of Trotteyn and Ezcurra (2014) placed C. bonapartei and P. ischigualastensis in a polytomy with G. reigi. They also suggested that R. gracilis, not included in the analysis, might be the sister taxon of C. bonapartei, based on morphology, further supporting the exclusion of P. ischigualastensis from Chanaresuchus. Trotteyn and Ezcurra (2014) distinguished P. ischigualastensis from other proterochampsids, including C. bonapartei, based on a unique combination traits. These include a transversely broad basicranium with transversely oriented basal tubera, paroccipital processes with vertically expanded far end, the absence of a retroarticular projection on the lower jaws, tail vertebrae with a mid longitudinal groove on the bottom surface of the centrum and with pre- and post-zygapophyses strongly divergent from the midline, the lack of foramina on the back groove of the astragalus, and finally, osteoderm ornamentation consisting solely of longitudinal grooving.  Phylogeny  The simplified cladogram below follows Trotteyn and Ezcurra (2014) phylogenetic analysis, who used the data set of Dilkes & Arcucci (2012).

In physical oceanography, a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present, while the beach is at the edge of the shore, representing the intertidal zone where there is one. In contrast to a coast, a shore can border any body of water, while the coast must border an ocean; in that sense a coast is a type of shore; however, coast often refers to an area far wider than the shore, often stretching miles into the interior. Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced erosion, such as waves. The geological composition of rock and soil dictates the type of shore which is created. Rivieras Riviera is an Italian word for \\"shoreline\\",The more common ones are puntellare and litorale. ultimately derived from Latin ripa (\\"riverbank\\"). It came to be applied as a proper name to the coast of the Ligurian Sea, in the form riviera ligure, then shortened to riviera. Historically, the Ligurian Riviera extended from Capo Corvo (Punta Bianca) south of Genoa, north and west into what is now French territory past Monaco and sometimes as far as Marseilles. Now it is divided into the Italian Riviera and the French Riviera, although the French use the term \\"Riviera\\" to refer to the Italian Riviera and call the French portion the \\"C√¥te d'Azur\\". As a result of the fame of the Ligurian rivieras, the term came into English to refer to any shoreline, especially one that is sunny, topographically diverse and popular with tourists. Such places using the term include the Australian Riviera in Queensland and the Turkish Riviera along the Aegean Sea.

Until 1930, Pintori lived in Sardinia and found work as a typist starting in 1927. It was during his time as a typist that he frequented a gallery owned by photographer Piero Pirari. Pirari suggested Pintori apply for a scholarship to the Higher Institute for Artistic Industries (ISIA), which he began to attend in 1930 after receiving the scholarship.Musina, Massimiliano. \\"Giovanni Pintori.

His other influential professors included Marcello Nizzoli, Giuseppe Pagano and Edoardo Persico. While at ISIA, Pintori started to work on a project for the town-planning scheme for the Aosta Valley, and through this project he met Olivetti's Renato Zveteremich. In 1940 in collaboration with the engineer and poet Leonardo Sinisgalli he designed an exhibition for the VIIth Milan Triennial; which was awarded the Grand Prize for exhibition design.

He worked in the advertising department before he became the art director in 1950.Friedl, Friedrich, de Long, Cees W., and Purvis, Alston W. \\"Creative Type\\" Thames & Hudson. 2005. pg. 50. In addition to designing Olivetti's advertisements and posters, Pintori was also responsible for designing the Olivetti calendars (from 1951 to 1969): every year he selected a collection of twelve paintings. The first calendar was dedicated to Henri Rousseau, and the last one focused on Nanban art. Pintori gained international acclaim after the exhibition \\"Olivetti: design in industry\\" held in the Museum of Modern Art in October- November 1952. The New York Times referred to this exhibition as \\"Industry's new approach to art\\". Giovanni Pintori was the recipient of many awards while working at Olivetti: * The Gold Medal for advertising by the Federazione Italiana pubblicit√† (1950); * The Certificate of Excellence in the Graphic Arts by the American Institute for Graphic Arts (1955); * The Gold Medal by the Milan Trade Fair and the First Prize Diploma by Linea Grafica (1956); * The Grand Prize at the XIth Triennial in Milan (1957); * The Typographic Excellence Award from the New York Directors Club (1962); * The Certificate of Merit from the New York Art Directors Club (1964). Later work Pintori decided to leave Olivetti in 1967, 7 years after the death of Adriano Olivetti, due to differences with the new management of the company. In 1967, he had his solo exhibition in the Design Committee Gallery in Tokyo. After leaving Olivetti, Pintori began working as a freelance designer out of Milan, opening his own studio. He continued to do freelance work for Olivetti, but also worked with numerous other companies in the Milan area. His work included designs for magazines and books (e.g., the magazine Successo, a book cover for Bigiaretti's I racconti (Stories), and the 1980 campaign for the company Merzario S.p.A., which would be his last advertising job before his death.Musina, p. 130 His clients included Ambrosetti, SIRTI, Ufficio Moderno, Gabbianelli among others. He would work in design until his finished the Merzario campaign, when he began to paint exclusively.Musina, p.130 While his paintings have appeared in some of his design projects for advertising agencies throughout his career, he stopped using graphic design in his work, and incorporated many images of perpetual motion into his work,Musina, p.135 however many of Pintori's later paintings are little known since he kept his work rather private. Pintori had only one public showing of paintings, in 1981 in Milan.Musina, p. 137 He would remain in Milan until his death on November 15, 1999, at the age of 87.Musina, pg. 133-135 Style Pintori's style is most commonly recognized for its use of color and geometric shapes, along with minimalistic style. Pintori developed his own vocabulary of signs: for example, a bird, flower, ship, letters and numbers. Many of his designs revolved around simplified objects rather than a direct reproduction of an object. This meant he was able to clearly represent products in his advertising with strong imagery and basic coloring.Musina, pg. 103-105. As pointed out by M. Sironi, Giovanni Pintori \\"succeed in fostering the perception of lightness and transportability through images of pure suggestion ‚Äì from the flight of a bird to a sailing ship composed of letters, numbers and punctuation marks ‚Äì and subsequently suggesting swift ocean crossings, or the association of the typewriter with the lightness of a feather.\\" Pintori commented on his design approach: \\"I do not attempt to speak on behalf of the machines. Instead, I have tried to make them speak for themselves, through the graphic presentation of their elements, their operations and their use.\\"  Literature  * Musina, Massimiliano: Giovanni Pintori.

After the toy was licensed to Marvel Comics, Rom became a character that debuted in the Marvel Universe in the eponymous American comic book Rom: Spaceknight (December 1979 ‚Äì February 1986), by Bill Mantlo and Sal Buscema. In July 2015, IDW Publishing began publishing a new Rom comic book series. In December 2015, it was announced that a live-action film version of Rom was in development by Allspark Pictures and Paramount. Toy \\"Rom\\" was a toy co- created by Scott Dankman, Richard C. Levy, and Bryan L. McCoy (US Patent #4,267,551). It was sold to Parker Brothers, and was the inspiration for the comic book series Rom: Spaceknight. The toy was originally named COBOL, after the programming language, but was later changed to Rom, after ROM (read-only memory), by Parker Brothers executives. The toy set a precedent for the game publishing company, which up until that time had only ever produced board games. As this was a new venture for the company, and given that electronic toys were still very new, a decision was made to produce the figure as cheaply as possible. As a result, the final product had very few points of articulation, and twin red LEDs served as Rom's eyes instead of the originally envisioned green, which were more expensive to produce. Rom appeared in the corner box of the cover of Time magazine's December 10, 1979, issue. It was featured in the interior article, \\"Those Beeping, Thinking Toys,\\" which decried Rom's lack of articulation and predicted it would \\"end up among the dust balls under the playroom sofa.\\" Rom was licensed to Palitoy in the United Kingdom to extend the \\"Space Adventurer\\" line of Action Man, appearing in their 1980 catalog. Ultimately, the toy failed and only sold 200,000 to 300,000 units in the US, with creator McCoy blaming the failure on poor packaging and marketing. Parker Brothers subsequently abandoned the line. A new action figure of Rom was released for the 2017 San Diego Comic Con and at HasbroToyShop.com in limited quantities as part of the IDW Revolution set alongside figures of Jetfire (a repaint of the previously released Transformers Thrilling 30/Legends LG-07 Leader Class Jetfire figure), Roadblock, Action Man, Leoric, characters from the Micronauts, a Dire Wraith and Matt Trakker. Publication history = Marvel Comics = To build interest in the toy, Parker Brothers licensed the character to Marvel Comics, which created a comic book featuring Rom. The comic expanded on the premise that Rom was a cyborg and provided the character with an origin and personality, and established the character was firmly grounded in the Marvel Universe, having regular encounters with mainstream heroes and villains. and Ironically the title outlasted the toy which it was created to support, with 75 issues and four Annuals (double-sized issues) published from December 1979 to February 1986. The comic was written by Bill Mantlo and initially illustrated by artist Sal Buscema. Buscema stated in a 2010 interview, \\"I liked the character. And I liked what they did with it. I thought the concept was quite good. It was unique. It made it attractive to do. I almost hate to say this, but it was pretty easy to draw, too.\\" Buscema was the main artist for the series from its creation through 1984. = IDW Publishing = IDW Publishing licensed the character from Parker Brothers' parent company, Hasbro, and on May 7, 2016, released Rom #0 as part of Free Comic Book Day. The free issue served as a prologue to a new ongoing series which began in July 2016. Rom continued to be part of the Hasbro Comic Book Universe until 2018, following the Transformers: Unicron event. On July 18, 2019, during San Diego Comic-Con, IDW announced a new series titled Rom: Dire Wraiths, which will be written by Chris Ryall and drawn by Luca Pizzari, Guy Dorian and Sal Buscema. Fictional character biography =Marvel Universe= The original ROM toy in packaging, as released by Parker Brothers in 1979. Shown in flashback, Rom was originally human in appearance, and belonged to a utopian society on the planet Galador. When the planet was threatened by the war-like Dire Wraiths‚Äîanother technologically advanced race capable of Skrull-like shapeshifting‚ÄîGalador's ruler, the Prime Director, called for volunteers to be transformed into cyborg warriors called \\"Spaceknights.\\" Volunteers were promised that their \\"humanity\\" (the body parts removed to accommodate the armor) would be preserved and restored to them after the danger was over. Rom was the first to volunteer, and was transformed into a large, silver humanoid that at first glance appeared to be totally robotic. Rom was given Galador's greatest weapon, the Neutralizer, which on one setting could banish the Wraiths into the Limbo dimension forever. Inspired by his example, other Galadorians volunteered and eventually one thousand were transformed into Spaceknights - each with his or her own unique armor, powers and code names. The Spaceknights succeeded in stopping the Dire Wraith invasion, although Rom decided to follow the remnants of the fleet back to their home planet, Wraithworld (which orbited a black sun). The Dire Wraiths panicked, and after a futile counter-attack abandoned the planet and scattered throughout space. Unable to stop Rom, the Dire Wraiths successfully used their sorcery to trick him into allowing their escape. Rom now felt responsible for spreading the Dire Wraiths' evil across the universe, and swore he would not reclaim his humanity until all Dire Wraiths had been vanquished. Fellow Spaceknights, including comrades Starshine and Terminator, adopted the same oath and left Galador. After 200 years in space, Rom arrived on Earth, landing near the fictional town of Clairton, in West Virginia, United States. Rom befriended a local woman named Brandy Clark, who after witnessing Rom deal with the Dire Wraiths began to assist him in his mission. Those witnessing Rom's neutralizer could not see the Wraiths being banished to Limbo, leading Rom to be hunted for killing innocents. During his time on Earth, Rom fought and banished thousands of Dire Wraiths. The increasingly desperate Dire Wraiths created new foes for Rom, including Firefall, a fusion of human and Spaceknight; the sorcerous Hellhounds; and robotic Watchwraiths. Two of Rom's greatest foes were Hybrid (the result of a union between Wraith and human), and Mentus (a suit of Spaceknight armor occupied by the dark side of the Prime Director's psyche). Other opponents were more traditional and hailed from the Marvel Universe proper, such as the Mad Thinker, the Space Phantom, and Galactus and his then-herald Terrax. He encountered such heroes as the X-Men, Power Man and Iron Fist, the Fantastic Four, Nova, the Thing, and the Hulk. Rom was one of the many heroes transported into an arena in space for the Contest of Champions, though he was not chosen to participate. At one stage a new breed of Dire Wraith arrived on Earth, and appeared to be far deadlier than the first variety. It was later revealed that these were females who relied on sorcery, as opposed to the weaker males who placed their faith in science. Unlike the males, the female Dire Wraiths chose not to act in secrecy and openly attacked Clairton while Rom was away, killing everyone (including Steve and superhero ally the Torpedo) with the exception of Brandy. Furthermore, they attacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mobile headquarters which gave Earth authorities clear evidence of the Dire Wraiths' existence and threat. So informed, the combined nations of the world pooled their resources to counter the threat, with Rom as their resident expert and leader of field operations. The Dire Wraiths came into conflict with the Avengers and the X-Men as well. Rom managed to banish all Dire Wraiths on Earth to Limbo with the aid of his super-powered allies and members of the U.S. military. Rom left Earth soon after the battle and returned to Galador. Unknown to Rom, Brandy had accidentally met the entity called the Beyonder, and Brandy asked to be transported to Galador. The Beyonder complied and Brandy found herself on Galador, now a war-torn world occupied by a new generation of Spaceknights. Created to defend Galador in the absence of the first Spaceknights, this next generation of cyborgs became corrupted by their power, massacred the Galadorians in a show of superiority. In an act of spite, the new Spaceknights destroyed the frozen remains of the originals. Rom arrived too late and could only save Brandy. Enraged, Rom summoned the original Spaceknights and together they destroyed the traitors. Rom then made a surprising discovery - his original humanity persisted within the entombed body of Terminator. Reclaiming it, Rom became human again and finally admitted his love for Brandy. The two chose to remain on Galador, with the intent of repopulating the planet. The remaining Spaceknights, their humanity now lost, set out to explore the universe, except for a few others that remained on Galador to protect Rom and Brandy. During Rick Jones's wedding to Marlo Chandler, the human Rom returned to Earth, together with Brandy, as guests at the ceremony, and Rom greeted the Hulk with a friendly handshake. In the Spaceknights miniseries (Oct. 2000 ‚Äì Feb. 2001), written by Jim Starlin, it is revealed that Rom took the name Artour (a reference to Brandy's love of Arthurian legends, and perhaps in memory of his own encounter with King Arthur's ghost) and that he and Brandy had two sons. Rom himself is not actually seen in the series, nor is he mentioned by that name or shown in his spaceknight form (possibly to skirt the fact that Marvel no longer held the license from Parker Brothers, which had retained the copyrights on Rom's name and armored likeness); his ship is attacked off-panel just prior to the start of the story, with Rom himself missing and presumed dead. =Hasbro Comic Book Universe= Rom plays an important role in the Hasbro Comic Book Universe by IDW Publishing. Two hundred years ago, Rom K'atsema lived an idyllic life with his brother and mothers on the peaceful planet Elonia, a world constantly protected by a powerful planet-wide shield that blocked debris and potential invaders. Rom studied geology at the Elonia University of Arts and Sciences, and befriended Livia and Fy-Laa. One day, the three of them investigated a mysterious meteor shower that had breached Elonia's shield and discovered that the explosive meteors were of Dire Wraith origin: weapons designed to penetrate the shield in advance of a potential Wraith invasion, and ultimately responsible for killing his family. When the Space Knights of the Solstar Order intervened, Rom learned that one of his mothers had been infected by a Wraith and transformed into one of their number. Vowing to avenge his family, Rom and his friends joined the Solstar Order as Space Knights. On his first mission, Rom would be responsible for discovering Elonia's supply of Ore-12, a miraculous liquid metal capable of \\"bonding\\" with its wielder and becoming a permanent suit of armor. Realizing that this mysterious metal was the reason why the Dire Wraiths had attacked their world, the Solstar Order would go on to mine the rest of the ore and equip the rest of their Space Knights with the substance. Soon afterwards, Rom‚Äînow a full-fledged Space Knight‚Äîleft Elonia, leaving behind a beacon in memory of his family. Over the next fifty years, Rom took part in a variety of battles against the Dire Wraiths, and participated in the massive battle that saw the Wraiths' current homeworld, within the Dark Nebula, destroyed. The Space Knights spent the next few years pursuing remnant Dire Wraith forces across backwater planets within Solstar territory. When Rom arrived on Earth, he was misjudged as Cybertronian. He killed a Dire Wraith impersonating General Joseph Colton, which later exposed the Wraith infiltration around Earth. In time, he gained new allies like the Micronauts, and together, they stopped Baron Karza and the Presence (the Wraith goddess). When Unicron arrived, it destroyed Elonia, which caused Rom to learn more about the monster and its link to the Dire Wraiths' creation. When Unicron was destroyed thanks to Optimus Prime's sacrifice, Rom and the surviving Elonians accepted Earth as their new homeworld, and Rom and Livia rekindled their previous relationship. Powers and abilities Rom's armor was composed of the Galadorian metal plandanium. It is extremely durable, even able to stand up to Wolverine's adamantium claws. It was shown to be damaged from time to time, demonstrating that plandanium is not indestructible. The armor had self-repair capabilities, though it took several weeks to repair major damage. It provided him with superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to travel through space via backpack rockets. It allowed him to breathe in any atmosphere and survive in the vacuum of space. In Spaceknight form, Rom also did not need to eat or sleep. Controls near the torso allowed Rom to lower the armor's temperature to well below zero. The armor stored a \\"solar charge\\" that could be used as a weapon and could drain power sources by mere contact. It gave him the ability to summon three pieces of equipment stored in \\"subspace\\": ;Neutralizer :Rom's primary weapon, which is designed to banish Dire Wraiths to Limbo by opening a dimensional portal. Unfortunately, the process leaves considerable waste material (ash, etc.) that makes it appear to an uninformed observer that the weapon kills its target. This handheld weapon could fire energy beams that could be deadly at a high setting. It could also neutralize various forms of energy. The device was designed so that only Rom would be able to discharge it. The Dire Wraiths unsuccessfully explored the possibility of examining the weapon to find some means of returning its victims to the normal dimension. The mutant Wolverine once tried to use the weapon and received a numbing blast of energy feedback. Rom's Neutralizer would inspire a similar creation by the mutant Forge when the US government tasked him with constructing a weapon against the Wraith horde. Forge's neutralizer, for a time, cost Storm her mutant abilities. ;Analyzer :Allowed Rom to see shape-changing Dire Wraiths in their true form and could assess the energy and potential of any object/entity. It could be used on an item which represented a world, such as a globe, and would display lights corresponding to Dire Wraith infestations at that point on the planet. Unfortunately, the device resembles a handgun, and Dire Wraith imposters took advantage of this fact to fool others into thinking that Rom is attacking them. Rom once arranged an ally to have the equivalent kind of vision, but the Dire Wraiths counteracted that by magically blocking his mind from recognizing that particular visual data. Regardless, Rom allowed SHIELD to examine the Analyzer in hope of creating equivalent devices among the Spaceknight's human allies. In the new \\"Rom\\" series by IDW, his energy Analyzer is represented as two red lenses mounted on his arms. The arms transform to reveal the lenses, which emit a red light when in operation. ;Universal Translator : Allowed Rom to instantly learn the language of any creature, irrespective of their origin. This device was used to scan and store printed information from an encyclopedia in Rom's memory banks for future use. In the IDW series, the Translator is not a separate piece of equipment, but a function of Rom himself. When he first speaks, he uses an alien language before shifting to English, seemingly mid-sentence. Other versions As Marvel Comics no longer possesses the licensing rights to Rom from Parker Brothers, the character is not allowed to appear in his armored form. Marvel has found ways to work around this dilemma. *In 2000, Marvel published a five-issue SpaceKnights series which featured a hero named Prince Tristan (codenamed \\"Liberator\\") in a redesigned version of Rom's armor. He fought alongside other SpaceKnights named after some of the more popular ones from the original series. *In the Captain Marvel series featuring Genis-Vell, Rick Jones was shown to own a toaster in the shape of Rom's helmet. *In the alternate world of Earth X, Rom had been banished to Limbo and was battling against the Dire Wraiths he had sent there. Rom was seen in human form wielding his Neutralizer and using his chest-plate as a shield. He was referred to only as \\"the Greatest Spaceknight.\\" *In The Avengers #12.1, the super-villain group, The Intelligencia, was seen working with a 'spaceknight' that had actually been a vessel for Ultron in his digital form, which he proceeds to reconstruct into his own likeness. Reprint omissions Legal issues regarding the reprinting of Rom guest appearances in other comics have led to complications. Brief cameos such as a holographic version of the character appearing as a distraction in Uncanny X-Men #187 have remained intact as have the Rom entries in the Essential Marvel trade paperbacks for the original Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe and its deluxe edition sequel. The cover of the Essential Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe removed Rom from the artwork used for the cover of the collection. Several appearances by Rom have been outright omitted. Power Man and Iron Fist #73, which featured Rom was omitted from Essential Power Man and Iron Fist vol. 1, and similarly Marvel Two-in-One #99 was omitted from Essential Marvel Two-in-One vol. 4, while The Incredible Hulk: Regression trade paperback features a heavily edited version of The Incredible Hulk #296, removing Rom's entire appearance in the issue. Furthermore, Rom #72, which was a tie-in to the Secret Wars II series, was omitted from the Secret Wars II Omnibus. In other media =Film= In December 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Hasbro Studios and Paramount Pictures were creating a movie universe combining Rom with G.I. Joe, Micronauts, Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, and M.A.S.K.. Michael Chabon, Brian K. Vaughan, Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer, Cheo Coker, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, Joe Robert Cole, Jeff Pinkner, Nicole Riegel, and Geneva Robertson joined the writing team for the project. By March 2018, Zak Penn had signed on to write the film's script.

He had been an Ekatat servant and then was a leader in the liberation of Siam from Burmese occupation after the Second Fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, and the subsequent unification of Siam after it fell under various warlords. He established the city of Thonburi as the new capital, as the city of Ayutthaya had been almost completely destroyed by the invaders. His reign was characterized by numerous wars; he fought to repel new Burmese invasions and to subjugate the northern Thai kingdom of Lanna, the Laotian principalities, and a threatening Cambodia. Although warfare took up most of Taksin's time, he paid a great deal of attention to politics, administration, economy, and the welfare of the country. He promoted trade and fostered relations with foreign countries including China, Britain, and the Netherlands. He had roads built and canals dug. Apart from restoring and renovating temples, the king attempted to revive literature, and various branches of the arts such as drama, painting, architecture and handicrafts. He also issued regulations for the collection and arrangement of various texts to promote education and religious studies. He was taken in a coup d'√©tat and executed and succeeded by his long-time friend Maha Ksatriyaseuk who then assumed the throne, founding the Rattanakosin Kingdom and the Chakri dynasty, which has since ruled Thailand. In recognition for what he did for the Thais, he was later awarded the title of Maharaj (The Great). Early Years Portrait of King Taksin, said to be done by a French priest in King Ekatat's funeral =Ancestry= Taksin was born on 17 April 1734 in Ayutthaya. Taksin had Chinese, Thai and Mon ancestry. His father, Zheng Yong (; Zh√®ng Y≈çng), who worked as a tax-collector,Parkes, p. 770 was of Teochew Chinese descent from Chenghai District, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.Woodside 1971, p. 8. His mother, Nokiang (), was of Mon-Thai descent (and was later appointed to establish the royal title of the Princess Mother Thephamat).Wyatt, 140 Nokiang's mother was a Mon noblewoman who was a younger sister to Phraya Phetburi (personal name: Roeang) and Phraya Ram Chaturon (personal name: Chuan). Phraya Phetburi (Roeang) was governor of Phetburi, then the Mon population center and royal naval base in King Boromakot's reign. Phraya Ram Chaturon (Chuan) served as chief of Siam's Mon community during the reign of King Ekkathat. Nokiang's father was a Thai commoner. = Childhood = Impressed by the boy, who was the Grand Chancellor of Civil Affairs (, ) in King Boromakot's reign, adopted him and gave him the Thai name Sin (‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ô) meaning money or treasure. When he was seven, Sin was assigned to a monk named Thongdi to begin his education in a Buddhist monastery called Kosawat Temple (Thai: ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÇ‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏™) (later, Choengtha Temple (Thai: ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏ó‡πà‡∏≤)). After seven years, he was sent by his stepfather to serve as a royal page. He studied Hokkien-Chinese, Vietnamese, and several Indian languages, and became fluent in them. It was the time he learnt Vietnamese, he took his name as \\"Tr·ªãnh Qu·ªëc Anh\\". When Sin and his friend Thongduang who was also a descendant of Mon aristocratic family were Buddhist novices, they reportedly met a Chinese fortune-teller who told them that both had lucky lines in their hands and would both become kings. Neither took it seriously, but Thongduang would become the successor of King Taksin, Rama I. =Early career= After taking the vows of a Buddhist monk for about three years, Sin joined the service of King Ekkathat and was first deputy governor and later governor of Tak,Webster, 156 which gained him his name Phraya Tak, the governor of Tak. In 1764, the Burmese army attacked the southern region of Thailand. Led by Maha Nawrahta, the Burmese army was victorious and marched on to Phetchaburi. Here, the Burmese were confronted by Thai soldiers led by two generals, Kosadhibodhi and Phraya Tak. The Thai army beat the Burmese back to Singkhon Pass. In 1765, when the Burmese attacked Ayutthaya, Phraya of Tak defended the capital, for which he was given the title Phraya Wachiraprakan of Kamphaeng Phet. He did not have a chance to govern Kamphaeng Phet because war broke out again. But maybe conflict with Kamphangphet acting officer title in Law of civilian, military, provincial 1455 which is called name title \\"Okya Ramronnarongsongkhramphakdiaphaiphiriyaha\\", as for the title \\"Phraya Wachiraprakan\\" found evidence that this name was first used in the Thonburi period, but not title name of Kamphangphet acting offier, it is Chiangmai acting officer title. Which may be understood that it is possible that he may never have received this rank at all. However, his merit was done during that war, it is also possible that he will receive this rank. Because considering the situation when the Burmese besieged the capital, he is one of the few governors who came to help protect the capital. Unlike other governors who have escaped to survive. Which correspond as Prince Damrongrajanubhab analyzed this event in \\"Our Wars with the Burmese: Thai-Burmese Conflict 1539‚Äì1767\\". And at that time Kamphangphet and many cities were completely destroyed by Burma, people all fled to survive. Therefore, should make the position of the governor vacant in many cities, King Ekkathat may therefore hope that Phraya of Tak will take over Kamphangphet after the battle. He was immediately called back to Ayutthaya to protect the city. For more than a year, Thai and Burmese soldiers fought fierce battles at the siege of Ayutthaya. It was during this time that Phraya Vajiraprakarn experienced the setbacks which led him to doubt the value of his endeavours. =Resistance and Independence= King Taksin the Great Monument, the monument of King Taksin accompanied by his four trusted soldiers at Chantaburi On 3 January 1766, shortly before Ayutthaya fell on 7 April 1767, he cut his way out of the city at the head of 500 followers to Rayong, on the east coast of Gulf of Thailand. This action was never adequately explained, as the royal compound and Ayutthaya proper was on an island. How Taksin and his followers fought their way out of the Burmese encirclement remains a mystery. He travelled first to Chonburi, a town on the Gulf of Thailand's eastern coast, and then to Rayong, where he raised a small army and his supporters began to address him as Prince Tak.Eoseewong, p. 126 He planned to attack and capture Chantaburi, according to a popular version of oral history, he said, \\"We are going to attack Chantaburi tonight. Destroy all the food and utensils we have, for we will have our food in Chantaburi tomorrow morning.\\" On 7 April 1767, Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese. After the destruction of Ayutthaya and the death of the Thai king, the country was split into six parts, with Sin controlling the east coast. Together with Tong-Duang, now Chao Phraya Chakri, he eventually managed to drive back the Burmese, defeat his rivals and reunify the country.Eoseewong, p. 98 With his soldiers he moved to Chantaburi, and being rebuffed by the governor of the town, he made a surprise night attack on it and captured it on 15 June 1767, only two months after the sack of Ayutthaya.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 385 His army was rapidly increasing in numbers, as men of Chantaburi and Trat, which had not been plundered and depopulated by the Burmese, naturally constituted a suitable base for him to make preparations for the liberation of his motherland.W.A.R.Wood, p. 253 Having thoroughly looted Ayutthaya, the Burmese did not seem to show serious interest in holding the capital of Siam, since they left only a handful of troops under General Suki to control the shattered city. They turned their attention to the north of their own country which was soon threatened with Chinese invasion. On 6 November 1767, having amassed 5,000 troops, Taksin sailed up the Chao Phraya River and seized Thonburi opposite present day Bangkok. He executed the puppet Thai governor, Thong-in, whom the Burmese had placed in charge.Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 401‚Äì402 He followed up his victory quickly by attacking the main Burmese camp at Phosamton near Ayutthaya.Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 403 The Burmese were defeated, and Taksin won back Ayutthaya from the enemy within seven months of its destruction. =Establishment of the Capital= The village of Thonburi, on the right (west) bank of the Chao Phraya (here in the lower left corner of the map), facing the fortress of Bangkok, during the 1688 Siege of BangkokJean Vollant des Verquains History of the revolution in Siam in the year 1688, in Smithies 2002, p.95‚Äì96 Taksin took important steps to show that he was a worthy successor to the throne. He ensured appropriate treatment to the remnants of the ex-royal family, arranged a grand cremation of the remains of Ekkathat, and tackled the problem of establishing the capital.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 388 Taksin likely realized that Ayutthaya city had suffered such destruction that to restore it to its former state would have strained his resources. The Burmese were quite familiar with Ayutthaya's vulnerabilities, and in the event of renewal of a Burmese attack on it, the troops under the liberator would be inadequate for effective defence of the city. With these considerations in mind, he established his capital at Thonburi, nearer to the sea than Ayutthaya. Not only would Thonburi be difficult to invade by land, it would also prevent an acquisition of weapons and military supplies by anyone ambitious enough to establish himself as an independent prince further up the Chao Phraya River. As Thonburi was a small town, Prince Tak's available forces, both soldiers and sailors, could man its fortifications, and if he found it impossible to hold it against an enemy attack, he could embark the troops and retreat to Chantaburi. His successes against competitors for power were due to Taksin's abilities as a warrior, his leadership, valor, and effective organization of his forces. Usually he put himself in the front rank in an encounter with the enemy, thus inspiring his men. Among the officials who cast their fate with him during the campaigns for independence and for the elimination of the self-appointed local nobles were two personalities who subsequently played important roles in Thai history. They were the sons of an official bearing the title of Pra Acksonsuntornsmiantra (Thai:‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏£‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏≤). The elder son was named Tongduang (Thai:‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏î‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏á). He was born in 1737 in Ayutthaya and later was to be the founder of the Chakri Dynasty, while the younger one, Boonma (Thai:‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏ç‡∏°‡∏≤), born six years later, served as his deputy.Prince Chula, p.74 Tongduang, prior to the sacking of Ayutthaya, was ennobled as Luang Yokkrabat, taking charge of royal surveillance, serving the Governor of Ratchaburi, and Boonma had a court title conferred upon him as Nai Sudchinda. Luang Yokkrabat (Tongduang) was therefore not in Ayutthaya to witness the fall of the city, while Nai Sudchinda (Boonma) made his escape from Ayutthaya. However, while King Taksin was assembling his forces at Chantaburi, Nai Sudchinda brought his retainers to join him, thus helping to increase his fighting strength. Due to his previous acquaintance with him, the liberator was so pleased that he promoted him to be Pra Mahamontri. Just after his coronation, Taksin was fortunate to secure the service of Luang Yokkrabut on the recommendation of Pra Mahamontri (Thai:‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ) and as he was equally familiar with him as with his brother, he raised him to be Pra Rajwarin. Having rendered service to the king during his campaigns or their own expeditions against the enemies, Pra Rajwarin (Thai:‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏ß‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡πå) and Pra Mahamontri rose so quickly in the noble ranks that a few years after, the former was created Chao Phraya Chakri, the rank of the chancellor, while the latter became Chao Phraya Surasih.Syamananda, p. 95 Reign =Accession to the Throne= Taksin enthrones himself as the king of Siam in 1767 On 28 December 1767, Taksin was crowned king of Siam at Wang Derm Palace in Thonburi (\\"Krung Thonburi Sri Maha Samut\\"), the new capital of Siam, yet had Siam official documents still used the official name of \\"Krung Pra Maha Nakhon Sri Ayutthaya\\"\\"Palaces in Bangkok\\". Mybangkokholiday.com.'.' Retrieved September 25, 2009. He assumed the official name of \\"Borommoraja IV\\" and \\"Phra Sri Samphet X\\", but is known to Thai history as King Taksin, a combination of his popular name, \\"Phya Tak\\", and his first name, \\"Sin\\", or the King of Thonburi. At the time of his coronation, he was only 34 years of age. W. A. R. Wood (1924) observed that Taksin's father was Chinese or partly Chinese, and his mother Siamese, and he said, \\"He believed that even the forces of nature were under his control when he was destined to succeeded, and this faith led him to attempt and achieve tasks which to another man would seem impossible. Like Napoleon III, he was a man of destiny.\\"Wood, p.253‚Äì254 The king elected not return to Ayutthaya but instead to make his capital at Thonburi, which being only 20 kilometers from the sea, was much better suited to seaborne commerce, but he never had time to build it into a great city,Wyatt, p.141 as he was occupied with suppression of internal and external enemies, as well as territorial expansion throughout his reign.Syamananda, p. 94 =Five Separate States= After the sacking of Ayutthaya the country had fallen apart, due to the disappearance of central authority. Rivals occupied the vacuum. Prince , Boromakot's son, who had been unsuccessful in a diversionary action against the Burmese in 1766, had set himself up as the ruler of Phimai holding sway over the eastern provinces including Nakhon Ratchasima or Khorat. The Governor of Phitsanulok, whose first name was , had proclaimed himself independent, with the territory under his control extending to Nakhon Sawan. North of Phitsanulok was the town of Sawangburi (known as in Uttaradit Province), where a Buddhist monk named Ruang had made himself a prince, appointing fellow monks as army commanders. He had himself pursued Buddhist studies at Ayutthaya with such excellent results that he had been appointed chief monk of Sawangburi by Boromakot. In the southern provinces north to Chumphon, a , the acting governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat, declared his independence and raised himself to princely rank.Wood, p. 254 Having firmly established his power at Thonburi, Taksin set out reunify the old kingdom by crushing his regional rivals. After being repulsed by the Governor of Phitsanulok,Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 414‚Äì415 he concentrated on the defeat of the weakest one first. Teppipit was quelled and executed in 1768.Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 418‚Äì419 Chao Narasuriyawongse, one of Taksin's nephews, replaced him as governor. Taksin led an expedition against him and took Phimai. The prince disappeared and could not be found again.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 430 In 1769, Phraya Chakri (later Rama I), Taksin's servant, attacked Nakhon Sri Thammarat, but got bogged down at Chaiya. Taksin sent his army to help capturing Nakhon Si Thammarat and finally won. In dealing with the Prince of Nakhon Si Thammarat, who was taken prisoner by the loyal governor of Pattani,Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 423‚Äì424 the ping not only pardoned him but also favoured him with a residence at Thonburi. In 1770, Taksin's army attacked Chao Phra Fang's group (Ruan), in control of Phitsanulok and Uttaradit, and was victorious. He had reunified Siam as one kingdom.Wood, p. 259. =Wars and Rebellions= Hsinbyushin of Burma had never abandoned his plan to force Siam to its knees, and as soon as he had been informed of the foundation of Thonburi as Taksin's capital, he commanded the Governor of Tavoy to subjugate him in 1767. The Burmese Army advanced to the district of Bangkung in the province of Samut Songkram to the west of the new capital, but was routed by the Thai king.Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 411‚Äì414 When Chinese troops invaded Burma, Hsinbyushin was forced to recall most of his troops back to resist the Chinese. After peace was concluded with China, the Burmese king sent another small army of 5,000 to attack Siam in 1774. But it was completely surrounded by the Thais at Bangkeo in Ratchaburi, and eventually starvation compelled the Burmese to capitulate to Taksin. He could have massacred all of them had he wished to do so, but he took them alive to promote the morale of the Thai people.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 462 Burmese reinforcements in Kanchanaburi were then mopped up. Undaunted by this defeat, Hsinbyushin tried again to conquer Siam, and in October 1775 the greatest Burmese invasion in the Thonburi period began under Maha Thiha Thura, known in Thai history as Azaewunky. He had distinguished himself as a first rate general in the wars with China and in the suppression of a recent Peguan rising. Battle of Bangkeo in Ratchaburi After crossing the Thai frontier at Melamao Pass, the Burmese marched towards Phitsanulok, capturing Phichai and Sukhothai on the way. In his interrogation of two Phichai officials, Azaewunky referred to Chao Phraya Surasih, the Governor of Phitsanulok, as \\"Phraya Sua\\" or \\"The Tiger\\", thus testifying to his boldness and decisiveness. The Burmese then besieged Phitsanulok which was defended by the brother generals, Chao Phraya Chakri and Chao Phya Surasih. The resistance of the Thai soldiers halted the Burmese outside the city ramparts for about four months.Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 491‚Äì492 Hearing about Chao Phraya Chakri's counterattacks which drove back the Burmese to their well fortified camp, Azaewunky arranged a meeting with him, in the course of which he extolled his generalship and advised him to take good care of himself. He prophesied that General Chakri would certainly become king. If Azaewunky's purpose was to sow discord between King Taksin and Chao Phraya Chakri, he failed, as they collaborated closely in subsequent military expeditions.Wood, pp. 265‚Äì266Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 493‚Äì495 In spite of Taksin's endeavour to attack the Burmese from the rear, Chao Phraya Chakri and Chao Phraya Surasih could not hold Phitsanulok any longer, due to lack of provisions. Having collected most of the inhabitants, they successfully fought their way through enemy lines and made Phetchabun their headquarters. Azaewunky led his army into the deserted city at the end of March 1776, but was soon confronted with shortages of food. At this juncture he was instructed by the new Burmese King, Singu Min or Chingkucha (1776‚Äì1782) to evacuate Thai territory. So Azaewunky's army left Siam, but the remnants of the Burmese forces continued the war until they were pushed out of the country in September of that year. In Taksin's opinion, so long as Chiang Mai was ruled by the Burmese, the north of Siam would be constantly subjected to their incursions. A prerequisite for the maintenance of peace in that region would therefore be the complete expulsion of the Burmese from Chiang Mai.Wood, pp. 259‚Äì260 In 1771, the Burmese governor of that city moved his army southwards and laid siege to Phichai, but he was driven out. Taksin followed the Burmese with a view to studying their strength. His army was not prepared for a direct assault on their city fortress. After meeting with stubborn resistance, he retired, presumably believing in an ancient prophesy to the effect that two attempts were required for the capture of Chiang Mai.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 435 King Narairaja had tried twice to seize it before it fell into his hands.Wood, pp. 260‚Äì261 The Burmese failure to take Phichai formed a prelude to Taksin's second expedition to Chiang Mai.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 438 In 1773, a Burmese army which threatened Phichai was drawn into an ambush and was routed. Phraya Phichai, the Phichai Governor, engaged the Burmese in a hand- to-hand fight until his two long swords were broken, winning him the name \\"Broken Sword.\\"Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 444 When a Thai army under the command of Chao Phraya Chakri and Chao Phraya Surasih reached Lampang, Phraya Chaban and Phraya Kawila, two officials who had deserted the Burmese joined him in laying siege to Chiang Mai. King Taksin soon joined them. The city fell to the Thai armies in January 1775, but the Burmese governor and the commander managed to escape with their families. Before his departure for Thonburi, the king conferred honours and distinction on those who had contributed to success of his campaign. Phraya Chaban was made Governor of Chiang Mai with the title of , while Phraya Kawila and Phraya Waiwongsa governed Lampang and Lamphun respectively.Wood, pp. 263‚Äì264 Chao Phraya Chakri was directed to prolong his stay in order to assist them in the pacification of the north, which included the Lao states. The Burmese King considered that as the Lao states constituted his base for the maintenance of Burmese power in the territory further east, namely, Luang Prabang and Vientiane, Chiang Mai must be retaken, and so a Burmese army of 6,000 men was sent there in 1776. The Burmese entered the city, but were forced out by a Thai army under Chao Phraya Surasih which had marched to its relief. Chiang Mai had suffered from the recent campaigns. Its population was greatly reduced and impoverished, and in the event of a new Burmese attack, it could not defend itself. King Taksin abandoned the city and its remaining inhabitants were transplanted to Lampang. Chiang Mai thus became a deserted city and remained so for fifteen years.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 530 Over the next few years, Taksin managed to gain control over Chiang Mai, and put Cambodia under the vassalage of Siam by 1779 after repeated military campaigns. =Relationship with Cambodia= Map of Indochina in 1760 Ang Ton and Ang Non II were cousins and bitter rivals for the Cambodian throne. In 1758 when Ang Ton ascended the Cambodian throne as Outey II he purged his enemies including members of the royal family. At that time his cousin Ang Non II fled to Siam where he resided for many years. In 1768, after Taksin had ascended the Siamese throne and defeated the Burmese he sought recognition and tribute from Outey II who still ruled Cambodia. Outey II rejected Takin's demand and insulted him in the process. As a result, partially for revenge and partially to resuscitate Thai suzerainty over Cambodia, Taksin attacked Cambodia in 1769 under the guise of putting Ang Non II on the Cambodian throne. There are conflicting reports regarding the success of Taksin's incursion into Cambodia, however it seems that most historians agree the campaign was a failure.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 427 In 1770, Taksin followed his unsuccessful incursion in support of Ang Non II by launching a war against the Vietnamese Nguy·ªÖn Lords over their support and occupation of Cambodia. Vietnamese sources reported that the aim of Taksin in attacking Cambodia was to uproot Ayutthaya royal \\"remnants\\" taking refuge in that kingdom. It was reported that there were two Ayutthaya princes who had escaped to foreign countries: Prince Sisang (‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Ç‡πå, son of Thammathibet) who had fled to Cambodia and Prince Chui (‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏¢, son of Prince Aphai, grandson of Thai Sa) who had fled to H√† Ti√™n where he was sheltered by M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª©, the governor of the principality. The result of Taksin's invasion of Cambodia was the creation of a back-and-forth proxy war between Siam and Vietnam that continued actively through 1771. During this time, King Taksin also invaded and captured H√† Ti√™n. M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© fled to Gia ƒê·ªãnh (modern Ho Chi Minh City) where he was sheltered by the Vietnamese. Taksin appointed Phraya Phiphit (Khun Phiphit Wathi, Tr·∫ßn Li√™n), a Chinese Teochiu, as the new governor of H√† Ti√™n.Water Frontier: Commerce and the Chinese in the Lower Mekong Region, 1750-1880, by Nola Cooke & Tana Li, p. 105 T·ª© stayed in Gia ƒê·ªãnh for two years as he was unable to return to H√† Ti√™n until the Nguy·ªÖn Lords reached an accommodation with Siam in 1773. Shortly after the Siamese army withdrew from H√† Ti√™n M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© retook his former principality. The actions of the Nguy·ªÖn Lords during these times helped to provoke and fuel internal rebellion in Vietnam, (the T√¢y S∆°n Rebellion) which would eventually sweep them out of power. Despite the fact that King Taksin had waged war against the Nguy·ªÖn Lords he gave refuge and shelter to some Vietnamese refugees of the T√¢y S∆°n Rebellion, primarily Nguy·ªÖn mandarins and generals. One of these refugees was M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª©, the former governor of H√† Ti√™n,ƒê·∫°i Nam li·ªát truy·ªán ti·ªÅn bi√™n, vol. 6 who was awarded the Siamese rank and title of Phraya Rachasethi Yuan.Siamese Melting Pot by Edward Van Roy King Taksin executed some Vietnamese refugees, and exiled others to distant borders.Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim, Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, vol. 2, chap. 8 Ultimately as the proxy war continued, Cambodia deteriorated into lawlessness. Cambodian governors ceased paying their taxes. Cambodians died due to starvation and cholera. Unable to rule and falling ill himself, Outey II abdicated to his cousin Ang Non II in 1775 hoping that a new king could save the country from further disaster. Although Ang Non II reigning as Reamea Thipadei III was successful in overcoming an attempt by the Vietnamese to overthrow him in 1776, internal unrest continued in Cambodia. In an attempt to quell revolt, Reamea Thipadei III and Outey II came to a compromise, whereby the Reamea Thipadei III served as the first king and Outey II served as the second king or Maha Uparayoj. Prince Tam was Maha Uparat or deputy to the first and the second king. This arrangement, however, soon proved to be unsatisfactory. Prince Tam was murdered, while Outey II died suddenly. Ultimately believing that Reamea Thipadei III was responsible for their deaths, many prominent officials under the leadership of Prince Talaha (Mu) (, ) revolted and drowned him in 1779. Prince Talaha put Prince Ang Eng, the six- year-old son of Outey II on the throne acting himself as the regent for the young king. Soon however, Talaha leaned too much toward Vietnam and came into conflict with the desires of King Taksin. As a result, Taksin initiated an invasion of Cambodia with an army of 20,000 under the command of Somdej Chao Phraya Mahakasatsuek. It is uncertain, but King Taksin's ultimate goal may have been to place his son, Prince Intarapitak, on the Cambodian throne, effectively annexing Cambodia to Siam. Before any fighting occurred however, disturbances in Siam caused the Siamese army to return to Thonburi.Buyers.Fight Against Vietnamese Influence...So, pp.44-48. =The Annexation of Champasak= Closeup of Emerald Buddha in summer season attire In 1777, the ruler of Champasak, which was at that time an independent principality bordering the Thai eastern frontier, supported the Governor of Nangrong, who had rebelled against the Thai king. The Thai army under Chao Phraya Chakri was ordered to move against the rebel, who was caught and executed. Having received reinforcements under Chao Phraya Surasih, he advanced to Champasak, where the rulers, Chao O and his deputy, were captured and summarily beheaded. Champasak was added to the Kingdom of Siam, and Taksin was so pleased with Chao Phraya Chakri's conduct of the campaign that he promoted him to Somdej Chao Phraya Mahakasatsuek Piluekmahima Tuknakara Ra- adet (Thai:‡∏™‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏î‡πá‡∏à‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏©‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡πå‡∏®‡∏∂‡∏Å ‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏•‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏´‡∏∂‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏ä) (meaning the supreme Chao Phraya, Great Warrior-King who was so remarkably powerful that every city was afraid of his might)Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 531‚Äì532‚Äîthe highest title of nobility that a commoner could achieve. It was equivalent to the rank of a royal duke. In Vientiane, a Minister of State, , had rebelled against the ruling prince and fled to the Champasak territory, where he set himself up at Donmotdang near the present city of Ubon. He made a formal submission to Siam when he annexed Champasak, but after the withdrawal of the Thai army, he was attacked and killed by troops from Vientiane. This action was instantly regarded by King Taksin as a great insult to him, and at his command, Somdej Chao Phya Mahakasatsuek invaded Vientiane with an army of 20,000 men in 1778. Laos had been separated into the two principalities of Luang Prabang and Vientiane since the beginning of the 18th century. The Prince of Luang Prabang, who was at odds with the Prince of Vientiane, submitted to Siam for his own safety, bringing his men to join Somdej Chao Phya Mahakasatsuek in besieging Vientiane.Wood, p. 268 After the siege of Vientiane which took about four months, the Thais took Vientiane and carried off the images of Emerald Buddha and Phra Bang to Thonburi. The Prince of Vientiane managed to escape and went into exile. Thus Luang Prabang and Vientiane became Thai dependencies.Wyatt, p. 143 Nothing definite is known about the origin of the celebrated Emerald Buddha.

When Taksin established Thonburi as his capital, people were living in abject poverty, and food and clothing were scarce. The king was well aware of the plight of his subjects, so in order to legitimize his claim for the kingdom, he made economic problems his priority. He paid high prices for rice from his own money to induce foreign traders to bring in adequate amounts of basic necessities to satisfy the need of the people. He then distributed rice and clothing to all his starving subjects. People who had been dispersed came back to their homes. Normalcy was restored. The economy of the country gradually recovered. Collected History Part 65. Bangkok, 1937, p. 87 Taksin sent three diplomatic envoys to China in 1767, which then was under the reign of Qianlong Emperor of Qing dynasty. In the first year of his reign, Qing dynasty denied his envoys due to him not being an Heir apparent from Ban Phlu Luang dynasty and the two Princes, Chui and Sisang, were political Asylum seekers in H√† Ti√™n. Six years later, China recognized Taksin as the legitimate ruler of Siam in 1772. The record dating from 1777 states: \\"Important goods from Thailand are amber, gold, colored rocks, gold nuggets, gold dust, semi-precious stones, and hard lead.\\" During this time the king actively encouraged the Chinese to settle in Siam, principally those from Chaozhou,Lintner, p. 234 partly with the intention to revive the stagnating economyBaker,Phongpaichit, p. 32 and upgrading the local workforce.Editors of Time Out, p. 84 He had to fight almost constantly for most of his reign to maintain the independence of his country. As the economic influence of the immigrant Chinese community grew with time, many aristocrats, whom he took in from the Ayutthaya nobility, began to turn against him for having allied with the Chinese merchants. The opposition was led mainly by the Bunnags, a merchant-aristocratic family of Persian origin, successors of Ayutthaya's minister of Ports and Finance, or Phra KlangHandley, p. 27 Thai galleons travelled to Portuguese colony of Surat, in Goa, India. However, formal diplomatic relations were not formed. In 1776, Francis Light of the Kingdom of Great Britain sent 1,400 flintlocks along with other goods as gifts to Taksin. Later, Thonburi ordered some guns from England. Royal letters were exchanged and in 1777, George Stratton, the Viceroy of Madras, sent a gold scabbard decorated with gems to Taksin. In 1770, natives of Terengganu and Jakarta presented Taksin with 2,200 shotguns. At that time, the Dutch Republic controlled the Java Islands. Simultaneously Taksin was deeply engaged in restoring law and order in the kingdom and administering a public welfare programme. Abuses in the Buddhist establishment and among the public were duly rectified and food and clothing and other necessities were distributed to those in need. Taksin was interested in art, including dance and drama. There is evidence that when he went to suppress the Chao Nakhon Si Thammarat faction in 1769, he brought back Chao Nakhon's female dancers. Together with dancers that he had assembled from other places, they trained and set up a royal troupe in Thonburi on the Ayutthaya model. The king wrote four episodes from the Ramakian for the royal troupe to rehearse and perform.Amolwan Kiriwat. Khon:Masked dance drama of the Thai Epic Ramakien .'.'

He invited ecclesiastical dignitaries from the capital to teach those monks and brought them back in line with the main teachings of Buddhism. Even though Taksin had applied himself to reforming the Buddhist religion after its period of decline following the loss of Ayutthaya to Burma, gradually bringing it back to the normalcy it enjoyed during the Ayutthaya kingdom, since his reign was so brief he was not able to do very much. The administration of the Sangha during the Thonburi period followed the model established in Ayutthaya,Sunthorn Na- rangsi. Administration of the Thai Sangha: past, present and future.'.'

Relationship with the Chinese Empire The Entrance of Taksin's tomb in Chenghai, Guangdong, China When Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese in 1767, Thai and Chinese sources mentioned that Taksin, then the lord of Tak, broke the Burmese siege and led his troops to Chantaburi. During those years, Chinese Empire had border conflicts with Konbaung Burma. The Burmese invasion into Siam became the warning for Chinese Empire. Taksin, then, sent a tributary mission to require the royal seal, claiming that the throne of Ayutthaya Kingdom had come to an end. However, his attempt was hindered by M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª© (Mo Shilin), the governor of H√† Ti√™n, whom had thorough knowledge of Chinese diplomatic practices and alleged that Taksin was a usurper.Eric Tagliacozzo, Wen-chin Chang, Chinese Circulations: Capital, Commodities, and Networks in Southeast Asia, p. 151 T·ª© also offered shelter to Prince Chao Chui, an Ayutthaya prince.Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim, Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, vol. 2, chap. 6 Chinese Court could not help but seize the chance by asking Taksin, as a 'new vassal', to be her ally in the war against the Burmese. Eventually Chinese Court approved the royal status of Taksin as the new king of Siam. A considerable contribution to his success came from the Teochiu Chinese trading community of the region, on whom Taksin was able to call by virture of his paternal relations; he is said to be half-Teochiu himself. In the short run, the Chinese trade provided the foodstuffs and goods needed for the warfare that enabled Taksin to build up his fledgling state. In the long run, it produced income that could be used \\"to defray the expenses of the state and for the upkeep of the individual royal, noble, and wealthy commercial families.\\"Sarasin Viraphol, Tribute and Profit: Sino‚ÄìSiamese Trade, 1652‚Äì1853 (Cambridge, Mass., 1977), p.144, citing a writing by King Mongkut, dated 1853, from the Thai National Library. As one contemporary observed, Fran√ßois Henri Turpin (1771), under the famine conditions of 1767‚Äì1768 : : \\"Taksin showed his generous spirit. The needy were destitute no longer. The public treasury was opened for the relief. In return for cash, foreigners supplied them with the products that the soil of the country had refused. The Usurper [Taksin] justified his claim [to be king] by his benevolence. Abuses were reformed, the safety of property and persons was restored, but the greatest severity was shown to malefactors. Legal enactments at which no one complained were substituted for the arbitrary power that sooner or later is the cause of rebellions. By the assurance of public peace he was able to consolidate his position and no one who shared in the general prosperity could lay claim to the throne.\\"Fran√ßois Henri Turpin, History of the Kingdom of Siam, trans. B.O.Cartwright (Bangkok, 1908), pp. 178‚Äì179; original French ed., 1771. A tomb containing Taksin's clothes and a family shrine were found at Chenghai district in Guangdong province in China in 1921. It is believed that a descendant of Taksin must have sent his clothes to be buried there to conform to Chinese practice. This supports the claim that the place was his father's hometown. Chinese people called it \\"Tomb of King Zh√®ng\\" (ÈÉëÁéãÂ¢ì), or its official name \\"Cenotaph of Zh√®ng X√¨n\\" (ÈÉë‰ø°Ë°£ÂÜ†Â¢ì). It had been included in the list of Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at Chenghai District (ÊæÑÊµ∑Âå∫ÊñáÁâ©‰øùÊä§Âçï‰Ωç) since December 5, 1984. Princess Sirindhorn had visited the tomb in 1998. Now the nearby area is opened to the public as Zheng Emperor Taksin Park (). =Final Years and Death= Thai historians indicate that the strain on him took its toll, and the king started to become a religious fanatic. In 1781 Taksin showed increasing signs of mental trouble. He believed himself to be a future Buddha, expecting to change the colour of his blood from red to white. As he started practicing meditation, he even gave lectures to the monks. More seriously, he was provoking schism in Siamese Buddhism by requiring that the monkhood should recognize him as a sotƒÅpanna or \\"stream-winner\\"‚Äîa person who has embarked on the first of the four stages of enlightenment., p. 33 Monks who refused to bow to Taksin and worship him as god were demoted in status, and hundreds who refused to worship him as such were flogged and sentenced to menial labor. Economic tension caused by war was serious. As famine spread, looting and crimes were widespread. Corrupt officials were reportedly abundant. According to some sources, many oppressions and abuses made by officials were reported. King Taksin punished them harshly, torturing and executing high officials. Discontent among officials could be expected. Several historians have suggested that the tale of his 'insanity' may have been reconstructed as an excuse for his overthrow. However, the letters of a French missionary who was in Thonburi at the time support the accounts of the monarch's peculiar behavior which reported that \\"He (Taksin) passed all his time in prayer, fasting, and meditation, in order by these means to be able to fly through the air.\\" Again, the missionaries describe the situation: : \\"For some years, the King of Siam has tremendously vexed his subjects and the foreigners who dwelt in or came to trade in his kingdom. Last year (1781) the Chinese, who were accustomed to trade, found themselves obliged almost to give it up entirely . This past year the vexations caused by this King, more than half-mad, have become more frequent and more cruel than previously. He has had imprisoned, tortured, and flogged, according to his caprice, his wife, his sons faction even the heir-presumptive, and his high officials. He wanted to make them confess to crimes of which they were innocent.\\"Journal of M. Descourvieres, (Thonburi). Dec.21, 1782; in Launay, Histoire, p. 309. Thus the terms 'insanity' or 'madness' possibly were the contemporary definition describing the monarch's actions: according to the following Rattanakosin era accounts, King Taksin was described as 'insane.' However, with the Burmese threat still prevalent a strong ruler was needed on the throne. Finally a faction led by Phraya San (or Phraya San, Phraya Sankhaburi) seized the capital. A coup d'√©tat removing Taksin from the throne consequently took place, Phraya San attacked Thonburi and took control within one night. King Taksin surrendered to the rebels without resistance, and requested to be allowed to join the monkhood in Wat Chaeng. However, the disturbance in Thonburi widely spread, with killing and looting prevalent. When the coup occurred, General Chao Phraya Chakri was away fighting in Cambodia, but he quickly returned to the Thai capital following being informed of the coup. Upon having arrived at the capital, the General extinguished the coup through arrests, investigations and punishments. Peace was then restored in the capital. According to the Royal Thai Chronicles, General Chao Phraya Chakri decided to put the deposed Taksin to death. Chao Phraya Chakri thought that the deposed king acted improperly and unjustly, which had caused great pain for the kingdom; so, it was unavoidable that he be executed. The Chronicles stated that, while being taken to the executing venue, Taksin asked for an audience with General Chao Phraya Chakri but was turned down by the General. Taksin was beheaded in front of Wichai Prasit fortress on Wednesday, April 10, 1782, and his body was buried at Wat Bang Yi Ruea Tai. The General then seized control of the capital and declared himself king together with establishing the House of Chakri.Nidhi Eoseewong. (1986). Thai politics in the reign of the King of Thon Buri. Bangkok : Arts & Culture Publishing House. pp. 575. An alternative account (by the Official Vietnamese Chronicles) states that Taksin was ordered to be executed in the traditional siamese way by General Chao Phraya Chakri at Wat Chaeng: by being sealed in a velvet sack and beaten to death with a scented sandalwood club.Prida Sichalalai. (December 1982). \\"The last year of King Taksin the Great\\". Arts & Culture Magazine, (3, 2). There was an account claiming that Taksin was secretly sent to a palace located in the remote mountains of Nakhon Si Thammarat where he lived until 1825, and that a substitute was beaten to death in his place.Wyatt, p. 145; Siamese/Thai history and culture‚ÄìPart 4 King Taksin's ashes and those of his wife are located at Wat Intharam (located in Thonburi). They have been placed in two lotus bud shaped stupas which stand before the old hall. Critics over the Coup It was not clear what role General Chakri played in the coup. Vietnamese royal records reported that King Taksin had some kind of psychosis in final years; he imprisoned Chakri and Surasi's family. It made the brothers resentful, so they made friends with two Vietnamese generals, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Tho·∫°i (ÈòÆÊúâÁëû) and H·ªì VƒÉn L√¢n (ËÉ°ÊñáÁíò). Four generals swore to help with each other in need. Not long after the coup occurred. Chakri quickly returned to the capital, put down the rebellion and had Taksin killed. Some Vietnamese sources stated that Taksin was assassinated by General Chakri,ƒê·∫°i Nam ch√≠nh bi√™n li·ªát truy·ªán s∆° t·∫≠p, vol. 32 others stated that he was sentenced to death and executed in public place. Phraya San also died in this incident. Another contradicting view of the events is that General Chakri actually wanted to be King and had accused King Taksin of being Chinese. The late history was aimed at legitimizing the new monarch, Phraya Chakri or Rama I of Rattanakosin. According to Nidhi Eoseewong, a prominent Thai historian, writer, and political commentator, Taksin could be seen as the originator, new style of leader, promoting the 'decentralized' kingdom and new generation of the nobles, of Chinese merchants-origin, his major helpers in the wars.Nidhi Eoseewong, p. 55 On the other hand, Phraya Chakri and his supporters were of 'old' generation of the Ayutthaya nobles, discontent with the previously said changes. However, this overlooks the fact that Chao Phraya Chakri was himself of partly Chinese origin as well as he himself being married to one of Taksin's daughters. No previous conflicts between them were mentioned in histories. Reports on the conflicts between the king and the Chinese merchants were seen caused by the control of the rice price in the time of famine.Hamilton, p. 42 However, prior to returning to Thonburi, Chao Phraya Chakri had Taksin's son summoned to Cambodia and executed.Syamananda, p. 98‚Äì99 All in all, Phraya Chakri was, in fact, the highest noble in the kingdom, charging the state affairs as the Chancellor. Therefore, he was of the greatest potential to be the new leader. Another view of the events is that Thailand owed China for millions of baht. In order to cancel the agreement between China and Thailand, King Taksin decided to ordain and pretend to die in an execution. Legacy Statue of King Taksin the Great at Wongwian Yai King Taksin was seen by some radical historians as a King who differed from the Kings of Ayutthaya, in his origins, his policies, and his leadership style, as a representative of a new class. During the Bangkok Period right up till the Siamese Revolution of 1932 King Taksin was, said, not as highly honoured as other Siamese Kings because the leaders in the Chakri Dynasty were still concerned about their own political legitimacy. After 1932, when the absolute monarchy gave way to the democratic period, King Taksin become more honoured than ever before. Instead, King Taksin became one of the national heroes. This was because the leaders of that time such as Plaek Pibulsonggram and even later military junta, on the other hand, wanted to glorify and publicise the stories of certain historical figures in the past in order to support their own policy of nationalism, expansionism and patriotism. King Taksin statue was unveiled in the middle of Wongwian Yai (the Big Traffic Circle) in Thonburi, at the intersection of Prajadhipok/Inthara Phithak/Lat Ya/Somdet Phra Chao Taksin Roads. The king is portrayed with his right hand holding a sword, measuring approximately 9 metres in height from his horse's feet to the spire of his hat, rests on a reinforced concrete pedestal of 8.90 √ó 1.80 √ó 3.90 metres. There are four frames of stucco relief on the two sides of the pedestal. The opening ceremony of this monument was held on April 17, 1954 and the royal homage-paying fair takes place annually on December 28. The king today officially comes to pay respect to King Taksin statue.

National Geographic No.77, December 2007. Bangkok : Amarin Printing And Publishing Public Company Limited, p.57 In 1981 the Thai cabinet passed a resolution to bestow on King Taksin the honorary title of the Great. With the intention of glorifying Thai monarchs in history who have been revered and honored with the title The Great, the Bank of Thailand issued the 12th Series of banknotes, called The Great Series, in three denominations: 10, 20 and 100 Baht. The monument of King Taksin the Great in Chanthaburi's Tungnachaey recreational park appears on the back of the 20-Baht note issued December 28, 1981. The date of his coronation, December 28, is the official day of homage to King Taksin, although it is not designated as a public holiday. The Maw Sukha Association on January 31, 1999, cast the King Taksin Savior of the Nation Amulet, which sought to honour the contributions of King Taksin to Siam during his reign.Swearer, p. 235 The Na Nagara (also spelled Na Nakorn)Dickinson, p. 64 family is descended in the direct male line from King Taksin.Handley, p. 466 Taksin Shrine in Tak City, Tak Province, Thailand King Taksin the Great Shrine is located on Tha Luang Road in front of Camp Taksin.

The street is a tourist attraction which draws foreigners and Thai nationals, primarily for its night life. The Walking Street area includes seafood restaurants, live music venues, beer bars, discoth√®ques, sports bars, go-go bars, nightclubs and hotels. Also on the street, tourists are often offered the opportunity to watch a variety of sex shows, for example, including sexual acts between performers of the show. The area is closed to vehicles from 19:00 until 03:00. Car and motorcycle parking is provided at the Bali Hai end. Although the closing time of the bars and clubs is officially 04:00, some stay open later illegally. Walking Street is in Pattaya city. A large video sign was erected in March 2010 at the Beach Road entrance The street has numerous bars, restaurants and attractions which advertise using bright large neon signs. Pattaya authorities began cracking down on oversized signs in 2015 in an effort to improve accessibility on Walking Street for emergency vehicles. Prostitution In addition to a large number of institutions offering sexual entertainment, a significant number of prostitutes, both girls and gay men, work on the street. Although prostitution in Thailand is illegal, there are estimated to be 27,000 prostitutes working in Pattaya, many in Walking Street. Many of the prostitutes work as bargirls in the bars and clubs along the street. Their clients are often required to pay a bar fine to take them out of the bar. In 2016, Thailand's first female Minister of Tourism, Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul, announced that Thailand was \\"closed to the sex trade\\" following adverse coverage in foreign media. In Pattaya, the aim was to push prostitution back to beyond Second Street, leaving the areas near the beach a family-friendly tourist area. Although there have been many police raids and crackdowns, the sex trade continues in Walking Street.

The city is commonly known as Korat (, ), a shortened form of its name. It is the governmental seat of the Nakhon Ratchasima Province and Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima District. Nakhon Ratchasima is the heart of the Nakhon Ratchasima metropolitan area. Korat is at the western edge of the Korat Plateau. Historically, it once marked the boundary between Lao and Siamese territory. It is the gateway to the Lao-speaking northeast (Isan). Its location is . , the municipal area had a population of 126,391. Toponymy Archaeological evidence suggests that in Sung Noen District 32 km west of present-day Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) there were two ancient towns called Sema (\\"Bai sema\\" () are notable artifacts of the Korat plateau) and Khorakapura. (Pali p√∫ra becomes Sanskrit puri, hence Thai (), all connoting the same as Thai mueang: \\"city with defensive wall\\".) N The latter name was shortened to Nakhon Raj. ( (‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£) derives from Sanskrit nagara (), \\"city\\"; (‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä), from Sanskrit Raj, \\"sovereign.\\") The present city name is a portmanteau of Nakhon Raj and Sema. The city is commonly known as \\"Korat\\" (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä), which is a short version of the ancient Khmer name \\"ankor raj\\". History Ya Mo Entrance Gate at the junction of Ratchadamnoen Rd and Hwy 224 Prior to the 14th century, the area of Nakhon Ratchasima was under Khmer empire suzerainty and known in Khmer as Angkor raj, Nokor Reach Seyma, or Nokor Reach Borei, and Koreach. Phimai, to the north, was probably more important. King Narai of Ayutthaya in the 17th century, ordered a new city built on the site to serve as a stronghold on Ayutthaya's northeastern frontier. Nakhon Ratchasima was thereafter mentioned in Siamese chronicles and legal documents as a \\"second- class\\" city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. A royal governor ruled the city in a hereditary position. After the final phase of the Ayutthaya kingdom ended with its complete destruction by the Burmese in 1767, a son of King Boromakot attempted to set himself up ruler in Phimai, holding sway over Korat and other eastern provinces. King Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom (1768‚Äì1782) sent two of his generals, brothers Thong Duang and Boonma, to defeat the prince, who was executed in 1768. Thong Duang later became King Rama I of the kingdom, and Korat became his strategic stronghold on the northeastern frontier to supervise the Lao and Khmer tributary states. Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station In 1826, Vientiane King Chao Anouvong, perceiving Siam as weakened, attacked Korat in the Laotian Rebellion against King Rama III that was to rage on for two years. Lady Mo, the wife of the deputy governor at the time, is credited with having freed the city from Anouvong's army, and has been honored with a statue in the center of downtown Korat. A full account of the war and its impact on Laos and Siam, is detailed in the book, Lady Mo and Heroism at Tung Samrit, written by Frank G Anderson. The city's old wall, east of the monument was designed and built by a French engineer who is believed to be the one who also built Naraimaharaj Palace in Lopburi. The French-based design is reflected in the moat system that surrounds the innermost portion of the city. Nakhon Ratchasima continued to be an important political and economic center in the northeastern region under the Monthon administrative reforms of the late-19th century. In November 1900, the Royal State Railways of Siam began operation of the Nakhon Ratchasima Line from Bangkok with Korat Station as its terminus. The Ubon Ratchathani Line to the town of Warin opened 1 November 1922. The Thanon Chira Junction to Khon Kaen opened on 1 April 1933. Korat station was changed to Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station in 1934. In October 1933, after the Siamese revolution of 1932 ended the absolute monarchy, the city became the headquarters of the Boworadet Rebellion, an abortive uprising against the new government in Bangkok. In April 1981 during another attempted coup, the government, together with the royal family, took refuge in Korat. From 1962 to 1976, during the Vietnam War, Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base hosted components of the Royal Thai Air Force, the United States Air Force, and a complement of the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). After the US withdrawal in 1976, the Thai Air Force assumed full control. During the 1980s and early-1990s, the airfield was jointly operated as a civil airport for Nakhon Ratchasima. This ended with the opening of Nakhon Ratchasima Airport in the early-1990s. On 13 August 1993, Thailand's worst disaster happened in the city, the collapse of the Royal Plaza Hotel, killing 137 people. On 8 and 9 February 2020, Thailand's most deadly shooting occurred in the city, when an offduty Royal Thai Army Sergeant shot 29 people dead and wounded dozens of others, mostly at the local Terminal 21 mall, before being killed by responding officers.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/02/08/thailand- soldier-terminal-21-mall-shooting-rampage-korat/4700184002/ Administration On 4 January 1908 Pho Klang subdistrict became Nakhon Ratchasima sanitation. The sanitation changed to town municipality (thesaban mueang) on 11 December 1935. On 8 March 1937 the municipality was enlarged to 4.4 sq.km. and later on 1 January 1983 to 37.5 sq. km. or 5 percent of Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima District. The status was upgraded to city municipality (thesaban nakhon) on 25 September 1995. The administration of the city is responsible for a population of 126,391 registered residents in 71,022 households. Climate Nakhon Ratchasima has a tropical savanna climate (Aw in the K√∂ppen climate classification), with the large majority of its rain falling between May and October. Economy One of the halls inside Terminal 21 Shopping Mall CentralPlaza at sunset Korat's economy has traditionally been heavily dependent on agriculture. It is known as a processing centre for Isan's production of rice, tapioca, and sugar. The Isan region accounts for half of Thailand's exports of those commodities.

There are 93 communities (chumchon), although not directly chosen by the local citizens, which provides advice and recommendations to local administrative organizations. Due to its location close to Bangkok the city is considered a suburb of Bangkok, part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, or Greater Bangkok. Nonthaburi is served by public transport systems including the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority bus system, the Chao Phraya Express Boat, and the newly opened MRT Purple Line., Nonthaburi is known for its temple and market such as Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat, Wat Chomphuwek, Wat Chotikaram, Wat Khema Phirataram, Wat Prasat, Wat Sangkhathan and so on. Koh Kret (Pak Kret District) Koh Kret is a small island located in Chao Phraya River in the province of Nonthaburi, and is some 2 kilometers long and 1 kilometer wide. In 1722, during the reign of King Thaisa of Ayutthaya, the island was called Khlong Lat Kret Noi which means a shortcut to Kret canal. Later, the current diverted, making the canal larger and turning the cape there into an island. Koh Kret has prospered since the Ayutthaya period as evident from the many temples on the island that are from that period. However, it may have been deserted when the Burmese sacked Ayutthaya. When Ayutthaya was reclaimed, King Taksin the Great relocated the Mon people who found religion here. The Mon people on the island came during the Thon Buri period and during the reign of King Rama II.

It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region megalopolis. With a registered population of 190,272, Pak Kret is the third most populous city (nakon) in Thailand. History The Pak Kret area has been inhabited since at least the 18th century, under the rule of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The portion of the Chao Phraya River to the west of Pak Kret city centre was excavated c. 1721‚Äì1722 to bypass a bend in the river, forming the island of Ko Kret. The settlements on the bank of the bypass canal and at its mouth became known as Ban Tret Noi () and Ban Pak Tret Noi (), meaning 'village on the lesser bypass' and 'village on the mouth of the lesser bypass', respectively (the \\"greater bypass\\" is further upriver in what is now Mueang Pathum Thani District.) Many ethnic Mon communities settled in the area during the Ayutthaya to early-Rattanakosin periods. Pak Kret was established as a sanitation district (sukhaphiban) on 31 August 1955. It covers the portion of Pak Kret District east of the river, namely the areas of Pak Kret, Bang Phut, Ban Mai, Bang Talat, and Khlong Kluea Subdistricts.

Phitsanulok is one of the oldest cities in Thailand, founded over 600 years ago. It is best known as the birthplace of King Naresuan, who freed the country from Burmese domination in the late 16th century, and that of his brother and successor King Ekathosarot (Sanphet III). As the crossroad between the northern and central regions of the country, it has long been important both for political and strategic reasons, and was fought over many times in centuries past. Phitsanulok was the capital of Thailand for 25 years during the reign of King Boromma Trailokanat of Ayutthaya. On the banks of the Nan River, the city was originally a small Khmer outpost known as Song Kwae, before the Khwae Noi River changed its course in the 11th century CE. Phitsanulok was also a provincial center of the Angkorian Empire during the Angkorian period.Thailand, A Short Story, David K.

Lack of a v sound in the Thai language accounts for the two forms. The second element, lok (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏•‡∏Å; Sanskrit: loka ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï 'world') means 'globe' or 'world'.

It is the only species in the genus Eira. Tayras are also known as the tolomuco or perico ligero in Central America, motete in Honduras, irara in Brazil, san hol or viejo de monte in the Yucatan Peninsula, and high-woods dog (or historically chien bois) in Trinidad. The genus name Eira is derived from the indigenous name of the animal in Bolivia and Peru, while barbara means \\"strange\\" or \\"foreign\\". Description Tayras are long, slender animals with an appearance similar to that of weasels and martens. They range from in length, not including a 37- to 46-cm-long (15 to 18 in) bushy tail, and weigh . Males are larger, and slightly more muscular, than females. They have short, dark brown to black fur which is relatively uniform across the body, limbs, and tail, except for a yellow or orange spot on the chest. The fur on the head and neck is much paler, typically tan or greyish in colour. Albino or yellowish individuals are also known, and are not as rare among tayras as they are among other mustelids. The feet have toes of unequal length with tips that form a strongly curved line when held together. The claws are short and curved, but strong, being adapted for climbing and running rather than digging. The pads of the feet are hairless, but are surrounded by stiff sensory hairs. The head has small, rounded ears, long whiskers, and black eyes with a blue-green shine. Like most other mustelids, tayras possess anal scent glands, but these are not particularly large, and their secretion is not as pungent as in other species, and is not used in self defence. The species have a unique throat patch that can be used for individual identification. Range and habitat Distribution of Tayra. Tayras are found across most of South America east of the Andes, except for Uruguay, eastern Brazil, and all but the most northerly parts of Argentina. They are also found across the whole of Central America, in Mexico as far north as southern Veracruz, and on the island of Trinidad. They are generally found in only tropical and subtropical forests, although they may cross grasslands at night to move between forest patches, and they also inhabit cultivated plantations and croplands. =Subspecies= At least seven subspecies are currently recognised: *E. b. barbara (northern Argentina, Paraguay, western Bolivia and central and southern Brazil) *E. b. inserta (South Guatemala to central Costa Rica) *E. b. madeirensis (west Ecuador and northern Brazil) *E. b. peruana (the eastern Andes in Peru and Bolivia) *E. b. poliocephala (eastern Venezuela, the Guianas, and northeastern Brazil) *E. b. senex (central Mexico to northern Honduras) *E. b. sinuensis (Colombia, western Venezuela, northern Ecuador, and Panama) Behaviour and diet Tayras are solitary diurnal animals, although occasionally active during the evening or at night. They are opportunistic omnivores, hunting rodents and other small mammals, as well as birds, lizards, and invertebrates, and climbing trees to get fruit and honey. They locate prey primarily by scent, having relatively poor eyesight, and actively chase it once located, rather than stalking or using ambush tactics. They are expert climbers, using their long tails for balance. On the ground or on large horizontal tree limbs, they use a bounding gallop when moving at high speeds. They can also leap from treetop to treetop when pursued. They generally avoid water, but are capable of swimming across rivers when necessary. They live in hollow trees, or burrows in the ground. Individual animals maintain relatively large home ranges, with areas up to having been recorded. They may travel at least in a single night. An interesting instance of caching has been observed among tayras: a tayra will pick unripe green plantains, which are inedible, and leave them to ripen in a cache, coming back a few days later to consume the softened pulp. Reproduction Tayras breed year-round, with the females entering estrus several times each year for 3 to 20 days at a time.Poglayen-Neuwall, I. \\"Copulatory behavior, gestation and parturition of the tayra.\\" Bull. Br. Mus. (Nat. Hist.) Zool. 7 (1974): 1-140. Unlike some other mustelids, tayras do not exhibit embryonic diapause, and gestation lasts from 63 to 67 days. The female gives birth to one to three young, which she cares for alone. The young are altricial, being born blind and with closed ears, but are already covered in a full coat of black fur; they weigh about at birth. Their eyes open at 35 to 47 days, and they leave the den shortly thereafter. They begin to take solid food around 70 days of age, and are fully weaned by 100 days. Hunting behaviour begins as early as three months, and the mother initially brings her young wounded or slow prey to practise on as they improve their killing technique. The young are fully grown around 6 months old, and leave their mother to establish their own territory by 10 months. Conservation Wild tayra populations are slowly shrinking, especially in Mexico, due to habitat destruction for agricultural purposes. The species is listed as being of least concern.

The project was designed by a team of architects led by . Since the 1990s, the pavilion it has been commonly called the Moscow Pavilion. In 1970 this building served as the pavilion for Hungary as part of the Expo67 extension, Man and His World. As with many of the exhibition pavilions of several other participating nations, this glass & steel hall showcasing Russian industry & culture was always intended (and thus designed accordingly) to be dismantled at the conclusion of the year long 1967 international exposition in Montreal, Canada and returned to the USSR to be re-purposed as Airport Terminal. This was done quite easily as the Expo67 venue was purpose-built on an artificial island created directly south of downtown Montreal in the St.Lawrence River, A large crane was employed to lift the large modular wall and curved roof panels of the dismantled pavilion directly onto three Russian cargo ships moored in the adjacent river, which then carried it back to the USSR. For various reasons, the airport project was not realized and after sitting in storage for a decade, it was finally decided to reconstruct this spectacular building in Moscow, Russia at the Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh) at the northern entrance. The building plan was modified \\"vertically\\" in the course of reconstruction,adding three new floors to the base of the structure substantially raising its height, but not affecting the distinct curvature of the spectacular roof design. The rebuilt pavilion then received a new name: \\"Inter-industry Exhibition Pavilion\\", but in publications often it is called the Montreal pavilion. (It is interesting to note that in its reincarnation this beautiful building essentially serves the very same purpose for which it was originally conceived.) The USSR Expo67 Pavilion is one of the finest examples of Soviet Modernism. The structure is built on a metal framework which is part of the internal and external structures, which play an architectural role. Directly in the entrance hall is on the high podium, which leads to the sweeping staircase. The facade of the pavilion is a continuous glass curtain wall with the expressive pattern of aluminum frames. Inside, the pavilion is divided into three floors, which are served by stairs and escalators that were taken from other buildings in Moscow.

In the center of the trail, next to the main entrance, is a stone tablet inscribed with his famous song poem \\"On the summit of Mount Scopus.\\"  History  Cave of Nicanor The garden was established in 1931 on the northern side of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus by Otto Warburg, who founded the university's Department of Botany together botanist Alexander Eig. It was the first botanical garden in the Land of Israel. The garden was a highlight of the scientific and educational work of botanist Alexander Eig who continued to teach at the university until his death. He planted the first tree in the garden. He established a program to protect the local flora. He collected plants in Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, brought seedlings from 350 Cedrus. The garden was the first home of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The Mt. Scopus period lasted from 1947 to 1950. In 1948, when there was no food in Jerusalem, zookeepers had to hunt stray dogs near garbage dumps to feed the carnivorous animals, many of which perished. Non-dangerous species had to be released. In 1950, with UN help, the animals were moved down into the city by weekly convoys.The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo The garden had been neglected over 19 years, when the Mount Scopus campus was in an enclave under Israeli control surrounded by Jordan. Indeed, in 1954 a new botanical garden was opened in western Jerusalem, near the Jewish National and University Library, on the new campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram. In 1958 two Israelis soldiers were killed in the garden by Jordanian ambush, also the \\"United States Chairman of the Commission\\" that came to mediate was killed in this incident. In 1980, it was decided to renew the garden, which was inaugurated in 1988. The garden is the first in the world to be recognized as an \\"ecological garden,\\" designed for nature conservation. Many of the species are very rare or non-existent in the wild.A garden variety, Haaretz = Burial caves = Graves of Leon Pinsker and Menachem Ussishkin The Cave of Nicanor is an ancient burial cave from the Second Temple period discovered in 1902. An inscription marked it as the grave of \\"Nicanor\\" who built the doors on the First Temple in Jerusalem. In 1934, the remains of Leon Pinsker from Odessa were reburied in the Nicanor cave at the initiative of Menachem Ussishkin, who envisaged a national pantheon on Mt. Scopus. However, the only other person buried there was Ussishkin himself, who died in 1941. A national leaders plot was established on Mount Herzl after the founding of the state in 1948, in part because Mount Scopus became an enclave in Jordanian-ruled territory.

Highway 12 is one of the major thoroughfares of Taichung, connecting the historic downtown at Central District with its newer central business district in Xitun District. The road is also one of three that connect to National freeway 1 in Xitun. Between 2014-2015, the Taichung BRT ran on Highway 12 between Taichung railway station and Providence University in Shalu District, and there are plans to build a metro line at the BRT system's former course.  Route description  Highway 12 begins on the north side of Taichung railway station, where it runs as a four-lane road in a northwest direction through Central District. After crossing Highway 1A in West District, Taichung, the road widens into a six lane road with additional separated motorcycle lanes on each side. The two lanes directly adjacent to the motorcycle lane divider are bus lanes, which were formerly dedicated to the Taichung BRT, but now permit conventional buses to run on. In Xitun District right after Maple Garden Park, the middle lanes are elevated over Route 127 on an overpass known as Guangming Overpass (ÂÖâÊòéÈô∏Ê©ã) before returning to ground level to pass under Highway 74. Then, the highway connects to National Freeway 1. After crossing the Fazi River, the road begins its ascent over Dadu Plateau. At its peak near Tunghai University, the road meets Zhongxing Rd, which connects to Route 136 for access to National Freeway 3. Here, Highway 12 turns north as it descends into Shalu District. The bus lane ends at Providence University. At downtown Shalu, the road turns northwest and is elevated again to cross the Western Trunk railway line on an overpass named Shalu Overpass (Ê≤ôÈπøÈô∏Ê©ã). After the overpass, the highway flattens out as it enters Wuqi District. It crosses Highway 1, Highway 61, and lastly Highway 17 before arriving at the gate of the Port of Taichung.

It is a Grade II listed building. History In the early 20th century Barnet Urban District Council was based at council offices at No. 40 High Street in Chipping Barnet. After the existing council offices were deemed inadequate for their needs (the building was a narrow terraced building in a row of commercial properties), civic leaders decided to procure purpose-built council offices: the site selected had previously been occupied by the Old Barnet Brewery Company for which liquidation proceedings started in 1909 and were completed in 1912. The new building, which was designed by William Bartlett Chancellor in the English Baroque style, was completed in 1915. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto Wood Street; the central section featured a doorway with a stone surround flanked by Ionic order columns and an arched pediment bearing the town's coat of arms above; there was a window with projecting flagpole on the first floor and semi-circular pediment bearing an oculus above; a turret was erected on the roof. The building was subsequently extended at the rear. The building continued to be the headquarters of Barnet Urban District Council for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government when the London Borough of Barnet was formed in 1965. The building was then used for a variety of purposes including as a location for the television drama series Midsomer Murders broadcast in June 2002. It also served as the home of the Barnet register office until it moved to Burnt Oak in Edgware in around 2008. After a major programme of refurbishment works costing ¬£275,000, the north London Coroner' Court, which had previously been based at Myddelton Road in Hornsey, moved into the building in October 2009. The court The court covers the London boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Enfield, Haringey and Harrow. Noteable cases included a hearing in May 2015, when the coroner, Andrew Walker, ruled that the death of Jeremiah Duggan, who had been attending a \\"youth cadre school\\" organised by the LaRouche movement was not suicide, and a hearing in September 2015, when relatives of Anni Dewani appeared at the court to request that an inquest be heard in England into her death in South Africa.

Kantipur  In February 1993, exactly two years after Nepal‚Äôs constitution was amended to permit a free press, Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post were founded by Shyam Goenka, when he was 27 years old. In fact, he had taken the initiative to start the newspapers, with very limited resources, when just about everybody dismissed his efforts to start a private media house as a bad business move. However, Kantipur defied all naysayers and went on to write a history of its own ‚Äì perhaps the greatest success story for a corporate in Nepal, post 1990.http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/nation/pdf/Nation_001.pdf Within only a few days of their existence, the two newspapers, Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post, went on to garner unmatched readership in the country, becoming the largest circulated and read newspapers in the history of Nepal with an estimated 75 to 80 percent share at the time. This was certainly a feat in itself because nowhere in the world, had a newspaper become the country's leading daily, by acquiring such loyalty from readers in such a short span of time. This was in stark contrast to the fact that two major Indian industrialists of that time, the Ambanis and the Thapars had also promoted two dailies of their own, at the same time and with huge resources and marketing, but failed to achieve much success, proving to an extent that acquiring newspaper readership and loyalty require much more than merely money and advertisement. Even today, the leading daily of India commands nothing more than 10 percent of the readership in the country; again, nowhere closer to the kind of leadership Kantipur enjoys in readership and circulation in Nepal. Despite its success, Kantipur was not being given any government advertisements, something that was crucial for sustenance of the newspaper. Thus, due to financial crisis and in order to prevent the employees from losing their jobs, Shyam Goenka ended up transferring his shares to Binod Gyawali and Kailash Sirohiya of the Namaste Group, hereby, handing over the reigns of the media house to them and renouncing ownership of Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post, therein. However, with the initiatives of Shyam Goenka and Kantipur, print media in the Nepalese private sector not only succeeded in acquiring credibility -a tag that until 1993, was monopolized by the government owned Gorkhapatra and the Rising Nepal-but also promoted professionalism in journalism to a great extent attracting talents to join in. The two newspapers, Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post have not only been one of the strongest contributors to the institutionalization of democracy and freedom in Nepal, but encouraged empowerment of the Nepalese milieu at large.

Biography Colin Faver was born in East London, and originally started out working in the Small Wonder record shop in Walthamstow. He became a big fan of punk rock, post-punk and new wave. His first 'DJ break' was when he asked to stand in for the regular DJ at London's Marquee Club. In the late 1970s/early 1980s, he was part of Final Solution with Kevin Millins, a promotions agency which publicised bands including Throbbing Gristle, New Order, and Culture Club. Between 1982 and 1988, Faver was resident at Camden Palace (with Mr. C and Evil Eddie Richards), where he played a heady mix of soul, disco, hip hop, Hi- NRG, electro and early house music and at the Hedonism parties in early 1988. At that time he was one of the founder members of then pirate radio station Kiss FM, where he brought the same selection of music onto the radio. Faver held down residencies at clubs such as Pyramid and Rage at Heaven, The Wag, as well as regular guest slots at clubs such as Shoom (run by fellow Kiss DJ Danny Rampling), Nude at The Ha√ßienda in Manchester, and increasingly travelling around the UK to play at raves especially during the acid house and Second Summer of Love period of 1988/1989. By the time Kiss FM had become a legal radio station in 1990, his show was focused on techno, house and breakbeat hardcore. Both his and fellow DJ Colin Dale's groundbreaking early 1990s shows on the station are regularly credited as being an important education and influence. His Demo DAT section on the show became increasingly important to showcase new and unsigned British material, and it was through this that both Digeridoo by Aphex Twin, and the debut EP by Force Mass Motion would first get played. Both would also be released on the Rabbit City Records label that he and DJ/producer Gordon Matthewman (aka DJ Edge) started in 1991. The first release on the label was their own production Cutter Mix / Beyond Control. Between 1992 and 1993, Faver ran the midweek London techno clubnight Knowledge at the SW1 Club with Jane Howard, partner Brenda Russell, and Colin Dale. Faver departed Kiss in June 1997. From 2006 to 2012, he hosted regular shows playing house and soul on Solar Radio. His most recent radio broadcasting was on the London station Mi-Soul in 2014. Faver died of multiple organ failure on 5 September 2015.

UWM is the first sport that combines Gaming technology with weapons-based Combat sports. The armored suit technology, also known as ‚ÄúThe Lorica suit‚Äù, completely protects its user's body while electronic sensors record an opponent's strike position and power on the body. Opponents use a variety of martial arts and weaponry to attack each other and software keeps score of the damage that would have been done to an unprotected body. The Lorica suit derives its name from the Latin word Lorica literally meaning ‚Äúbody armor‚Äù. Also, the name references various armor types of the Roman army such as the Lorica segmentata. Background Forsell first envisioned UWM when attending while training krabi-krabong at the Buddhai Swan Sword Fencing Institute in Bangkok. While there, Forsell envisioned a forum for all the world's myriad weapons-based martial arts to be practiced at once. Weapons-based martial arts have been practiced globally throughout history and, although most have died out due to modernizing warfare, there are ninety- six arts still practiced. Yet there is no platform for cross-discipline challenges to objectively determine a winner. In addition, full-contact fighters using weapons are near impossible since, ‚Äúbarring all-out death matches, there‚Äôs really no way for weapons based martial artists to really test their skills.‚Äù The founders therefore sought to establish one single arena for comprehensive competition. Team Unified Weapons Master was founded by David Pysden, Justin Forsell and Samantha English, each with backgrounds in several industries including martial arts and software engineering. Forsell specifically has extensive background in full-contact, semi-contact and weapons-based martial arts. Other technical experts include gaming and film consultants, as well as medical consultants with anatomical expertise. Pysden has stated \\"Our vision is to reignite interest in weapons- based martial arts that have been practised and developed over thousands of years\\". The suit developers include experienced armorers, prop-makers, and mold makers, while the software is run by several engineers and programmers. Business model Pysden has stated that UWM's investors are private and has not disclosed the series A funding amount. As of July 2014, UWM had completed a series A round of funding, also for an undisclosed amount. In 2015, Chiron launched a project titled ‚ÄúIndiegogo‚Äù to raise additional capital while raising awareness. To date it has raised around USD $50,000 of their goal of $72,000. Lorica technology UWM features ‚ÄúThe Lorica‚Äù combat suit: an intelligent carbon-fiber suit of armor with advanced levels of protection and biometrics to measure heart-rate and temperature. In addition the suit includes forty electronic pressure sensors on the inside which record any strikes made against the armor. The armor software calculates the force and location of each strike on the suit and calculates the damage that would be done on an unarmored body, which is recorded in real-time. The software uses an anatomical fracture profile and a database of body injuries to determine and display in-match damage. The UWM Lorica suit will allow weapons-based competitions to be held for any martial artist. Competitors are designated a ‚Äúlife force‚Äù for each round which is diminished with each successful strike from the opponent. Bouts end when one competitor's life force falls to zero or if time runs out, in which case the competitor with more life force left is the winner. A helmet camera and microphone allow viewers to witness the full experience of combatants. It also allows communication between competitors and coaches. Goals UWM is hopeful that the first competitions will be held before the end of 2015. Initially these will be smaller events to serve as beta-testing to search for bugs in the software. Once improved, UWM intends to launch on a larger, eventually global scale. Psyden has also expressed his belief that UWN will ‚Äúinstantly resonate with a television audience‚Äù. Competitors from any martial arts discipline can compete around the globe. UWM hopes to become a worldwide sport to be practiced among martial arts experts to seek champions across all disciplines. In addition, the Lorica can allow for competition between martial artists of all levels. Pysden has also stated ‚Äúthe Lorica suit is the first opportunity to see some of the most ancient weapons-based martial arts showcased in the modern era‚Äù. Pysden has also stated that besides the immediate use of weapons-based martial arts, there are long term applications among military and law enforcement training. \\"In the longer term we could see this even going into gyms,\\" Pysden has said.\\\\ Chiron intends to create a next generation of The Lorica that is about a third the weight of the current generation. Once challenge the Chiron team faces is implementing edged weapons into its metrics. Blunted weapons are easily recorded in their anatomical metrics, whereas edged weapons will require further development.

Early life In 1918 at the age of 14, Khidekel was selected by Marc Chagall to study at the Vitebsk school of art, where he first met Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitzky. Khidekel became one of the founders of the group UNOVIS - Affirmers of New Art led by Malevich and one of a few of Malevich's students, along with Ilya Chashnik and Nikolai Suetin, who deeply embraced Suprematist style and philosophy, and constituted the nucleus of genuine followers who soon become into their master's partners and assistants. Contributions By developing Suprematist ideas, Khidekel early defined his personal approach to Suprematist canon, introducing his own Suprematist painterly idioms, forms, ideas, and thoughts. Rapid maturation of Lazar Khidekel‚Äôs creative approach during the vital years of 1919 -1922 at Vitebsk Art School, defined his role in developing Suprematism‚Äôs inherent potential in painting and architecture. Elaborating conceptual approach and crossing disciplinary divide, Khidekel's contribution was critical in extricating from two-dimensional Suprematist shape to its three-dimensional, spatial expression, and as noted Maria Kokkori, Khidekel was distinguished by drawing buildings and building drawings. In 1921, after El Lissitzky left for Moscow, Khidekel and his classmate Ilya Chashnik headed the Architecture and Technical Department of the Vitebsk Art School. Inspired by his artistic imagination, Khidekel developed a lifelong fascination with visionary and imaginary architecture that he knew could only become a reality in the distant future. =Suprematism= He played an important role in Suprematism‚Äôs historical development by applying its precepts to both practical architectural projects and imaginary floating structures for the future. He was instrumental in the transition from planar Suprematism to volumetric Suprematism, creating axonometric projections (The Aero-club: Horizontal architecton, 1922‚Äì23), making three-dimensional models, such as the architectons, designing objects (model of an \\"Ashtray\\", 1922‚Äì23), and producing the first Suprematist architectural project (The Workers‚Äô Club, 1926). In the mid-1920s, he began his journey into the realm of visionary architecture. Directly inspired by Suprematism and its notion of an organic form-creation continuum, he explored new philosophical, scientific and technological futuristic approaches, and proposed innovative solutions for the creation of new urban environments, where people would live in harmony with nature and would be protected from man-made and natural disasters (his still topical proposal for flood protection - the City on the Water, 1925, etc.). In 1926, while a student of the Architectural College (PIGI) in Petrograd, he created the first real Suprematist architectural project. His immense influence on the students and professors of PIGI resulted in a series of collaborative works with his professors A.S. Nikolsky and G. Simonov that defined Lazar Khidekel‚Äôs groundbreaking role in developing Suprematist and Constructivist-Suprematist style as an ultimate trend of the Leningrad avant-garde architecture of mid 1920s - early 1930s. In the mid 1920s he envisioned his projects of the futurist cities such as Aero-city, Garden-city, City on the Poles and on the Water, that firstly young Lazar Khidekel defined in his 1920 hand lithographed manifesto ‚ÄúAERO. Articles and Projects‚Äù. In this publication Lazar defined new social and aesthetic approaches and solutions to the issues of the ecological impact on the environment produced by the modern industrial civilization. He was the only architect from Malevich's group who completed innovative ideas in the building of residential complexes, theaters, movie-houses, and in drafting plans for new forms of skyscrapers. In the middle of the 1920s Khidekel was exploring specialized projects of buildings for a new way of life, the communal housing in Suprematist style, as well as he was the first in the 20th century to create projects of futuristic cities.

The mission of the Department of Epidemiology is to improve the public's health by training epidemiologists and by advancing knowledge concerning the causes and prevention of disease and the promotion of health. The American Journal of Epidemiology (originally named the American Journal of Hygiene has been based in the department since the journal's inception in 1920. In addition, the department is home to Epidemiologic Reviews (current Editor-in-Chief is Dr. Michel Ibrahim). Several major research studies are housed in the department, led by epidemiology faculty members, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, the Multicultural AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), and the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS).  History  The Department of Epidemiology is the oldest (established in 1917). The Department of Chronic Disease was originally created as a division in Public Health Administration in 1954, made into a department in 1961, and then merged with the Department of Epidemiology in 1970. The Department of Chronic Disease, before it merged with the Department of Epidemiology, was chaired by Joseph Earle Moore (1954-1957) and Abraham Lilienfeld (1958-1970).  Degree Programs  The Department of Epidemiology offers three doctoral-level programs, two master's-level programs, and one joint degree for undergraduate students. The Department co-sponsors three concentrations for the school-wide Master of Public Health program: 1) Epidemiological & Biostatistics Methods for Public Health and Clinical Research, 2) Food, Nutrition & Health and 3) Infectious Diseases. * Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) - first awarded in 1921 * Doctor of Science in Hygiene (ScD) - first awarded in 1924 * Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) - first awarded in 1965 * Master of Health Science (MHS) - first awarded in 1973 * Master of Science (ScM) * Bachelor of Arts/Master of Health Science (BA/MHS)  Non-Degree Programs  The Department of Epidemiology began offering the Graduate Summer Institute of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in 1983. It offers short, intensive courses in epidemiology and biostatistics iCourse lengths span one day, one week, or three weeks, and are offered online or on-site in Baltimore, Maryland. The department also offers a number of 'certificate programs online or on-site, including: Epidemiology for Public Health Professional, Healthcare Epidemiology, Infection Control, and Prevention, Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, and Clinical Trials.  Training Programs  The Department currently has the largest overall postdoctoral training program in the School of Public Health.

History  The Frognot community was located east of Blue Ridge. It had a store and a school. The Frognot water district still survives. The name is also spelled Frog Not. There are several theories as to where the name came from. One is that the area had an abundance of frogs. They killed the frogs and became known as Frognot. Another theory is that the boys brought frogs to school. The school adopted a no frog policy. Some people say the name is actually Frog Nod because the frogs are singing when they nod off to sleep. = Frognot Community Historical Marker = The Frognot Community historical marker is located on the north side FM 981 east of Collin County road 628. The text on the historical marker reads: \\"Situated near creeks and branches in a valley east of Blue Ridge, the Frognot community (also known as Frog Not, Frog Nod, Frogknot) has a number of theories as to the origins of its name. Most of these theories involve frogs that appear in the nearby Indian Creek following a rain. Several theories are associated with the nearby Dixon Consolidated School, which served as the foundation for the establishment of the community in the early 1900s. The school was founded in 1913 on land from Stephen Arnold Douglas Box. The school had a strict schoolmaster, Mr. Homer Parkins, who would not allow kids to bring frogs they captured in the creek to school. This policy evolved into several stories as to the origin of the community name. Another theory is that soon after the community was founded, the people attempted to eradicate the overabundant frog population. Within a short time, they virtually wiped out the frog populace, giving the community the name Frognot. Some believe that the community began as Frog Nod because the frogs were extremely loud while nodding off to sleep, and eventually became Frognot. Another theory is that the residents did not want a noisy railroad switch, which is also known as a railroad frog, and thus the community was named Frog Not. In the late 1930s, John and Ollie McGuffey opened the first general store. A second store was opened in the 1950s by Otis and Hazel Dixon. The Dixon Store served as the social center of the community and was the location of the foundation of the Frognot Water Supply Corporation. The concrete storm cellar from the Dixon School is all that remains of this rural community.\\" (2013) Marker is Property of the State of Texas = Frognot Store = In 1926, Otis and Hazel Dixon opened Frognot General Store, where they sold Sinclair gasoline for 10 cents a gallon, as well as salt, bread, milk, and sometimes vegetables from their own garden. They also sold Black Angus beef from the livestock raised by Otis, long before Black Angus was known as a premium product. The store was a gathering place for local folk, and where the idea of starting Frognot Water Supply Corporation was born. The store has been closed since the late 1980s.  Frognot Water Supply  Frognot WSC was incorporated on December 22, 1965 for the sole purpose of providing water to the rural area of Blue Ridge, Texas from the Woodbine Aquifer. Our system consists of three wells and over 68 miles of water line and includes 147 square miles of service area in the Blackland Prairie. AND THE STORY GOES... The Frognot Water Supply Corporation was created when the local farmers and ranchers met in the Dixon General Store in the Frognot Community October 1965. Prior to this time, the Frognotters collected water from cisterns and wells. On December 22, 1965, the Frognot Water Supply Corporation was incorporated to provide safe, potable water to members who reside in the rural, unincorporated area near Blue Ridge, Texas. One hundred and four meters were needed for the water system. A total of 107 were purchased including 38 meters which were purchased by 17 people to insure the creation of the Frognot Water Supply Corporation. Truman Webb was the first General Manager (1965-July 1987). Robert Todd became the second General Manager in August 1987 and continues to serve. When the system was first installed, Mary Hall of Garland, Texas painted the first frog on the big tank for the Frognot Water Supply corporation as a public service. Mrs. Hall, who was very brave, got on a scaffold and painted a bright green man-size portrait of a frog sitting on a toadstool or a mushroom. The frog on the tank looked like a cross between a tree frog, a leopard frog and a lizard which was a frog of rather unconventional appearance. It appeared that Mrs. Hall wanted the frog to have as much life as the community. Her painting stayed on the tank until it rusted and was repainted in 1974. In 2000, Matt Alderson, who was fourteen at the time, sketched a frog which was selected by the board to serve as the FWSC logo; he too got on a scaffold and painted the frog on the water tanks. His sketching of the frog has become a symbol for Frognot and adorns each of the three tanks that pump water from the Woodbine Aquifer. The water from the Woodbine Aquifer provides water for the rural area of Blue Ridge, Texas. The system consists of three wells and over 70 miles of water line and includes 147 square miles of service to 583 customers in the small communities of Frognot, Arnold, Bethlehem, Fayburg, Jamestown, Moreland and Pike.

Biography She was born in Lansing, Michigan to Clifford and Helen (n√©e Dailey) Baker. She attended Marygrove College and then the American Film Institute at age 56. She was awarded AFI‚Äôs Mary Pickford Prize for top screenplay. Her best-known novels were I‚Äôm Running Away From Home but I‚Äôm Not Allowed to Cross the Street: A Primer of Women‚Äôs Liberation, Heartbreak Hotel, Impatient With Desire and Searching for Tamsen Donner. Burton was awarded a Nicholl Fellowship in 2000 for her screenplay The Imperial Waltz. An early feminist in second wave feminism,:fr:Deuxi√®me vague f√©ministe Burton traveled with Gloria Steinem to talk about her experience as a mother of five daughters (film director Maria Burton, film producer Jennifer Burton, actor/director Ursula Burton, director/writer Gabrielle C. Burton, and producer and teacher Charity Burton); she and her husband Roger Burton would speak as a couple to crowds or in living room intimate settings among neighbors about the impact of working for equality for men and women, and how this would help family dynamics. Burton studied psychology at Marygrove College, the first in her family to go to college. She then became a missionary in Barbados for a year, followed by moving to Washington D.C. to become a teacher. Her husband joined the NIMH (National Institute for Mental Health) as a researcher of child development, after his work in Europe with Jean Piaget; his most well known contribution is in the field of children and the development of morality. He also developed a study to look at gender influence in audiences watching films, creating a system of ocular movement observation through the movie screen which was later copied by other researchers; Gabrielle Burton's understanding of psychology research created a solid team as a couple which influenced their decision to move to Buffalo, New York to actively pursue raising children as a parenting team. In 2002, she wrote the screen play for Manna from Heaven.

WBL programs are targeted to bridge the gap between the learning and the doing. \\"Work-based learning strategies provide career awareness, career exploration opportunities, career planning activities and help students attain competencies such as positive work attitudes and other employable skills.\\" Work-based learning encompasses a diversity of formal, nonformal and informal arrangements including apprenticeships, work placement and informal learning on the job. The key driver is the need for active policies to secure learning that meets the need of the workplace. Classification Work-based learning is classified in three ways based on the: *Duration of assignment: The work- based learning experience maybe of a duration of a few hours to 2/4 years *Relation to course work: Work-based learning is generally related to a specific subject taught at school or university *Stipend: WBL assignments may be paid or unpaid WBL learning strategies Work-based learning strategies include the following: *Apprenticeship or internship or mentorship: An apprenticeship involves the student working for an employer where he or she is taught and supervised by an experienced employee of the chosen organization. The student is periodically evaluated for progress as per the skills and knowledge acquired, and maybe granted wages accordingly. At the end of the course, the student receives a certificate of service. The student learns in a realistic environment and gets the opportunity to apply his or her knowledge in real-world scenarios. *Job shadowing: Job Shadowing is a short term opportunity that introduces the student to a particular job or career by pairing the student with an employee of the workplace. By following or 'shadowing' the employee, the student gets familiar with the duties and responsibilities associates with that job. *Business/industry field trip: Field trips offer the students an insight in the latest technical advancements and business strategies of an enterprise. Students also gain awareness of the various career opportunities available and understand the driving forces of the community's economy. *Entrepreneurial experience: This includes setting up of specific business, right from the planning, organizing and managing stage to the risk control and management aspects of a business. *Cooperative education: In cooperative education, the work experience is planned in conjunction with the technical classroom instruction. This method is used by universities that do not have access to state-of-art equipment required to transact the technical course practically. *School-based enterprise: A school- based enterprise is a simulated or actual business run by the school.

Can't wait.\\" =Location controversy= Much of the film was shot at Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, California, after the Manhattan Beach Unified School District granted a facilities use permit to The Yard Entertainment, the production company. After two days of filming over the weekend of May 7, 2011, production was halted when it was reported that individuals (some involved with the film, some not) were smoking marijuana on campus, leading the school district to revoke the permit. During the shoot, one group drove a car down the front stairs on the high school causing skid marks. Vandalism and theft from classrooms were also reported by teachers, and The Yard reportedly offered reimbursement to at least one. =DVD release= Straight-to-DVD release of the film was scheduled for April 20, 2012, which was then delayed to July 3, 2012. , the DVD had sold 54,641 units in the United States.Mac & Devin Go To High School - DVD Sales - The Numbers Critical response Mac & Devin Go to High School was panned by critics. Pre-release reviews were negative. After its release, JP DelaCuesta of AllHipHop gave it a 3/10, saying: \\"There‚Äôs no other way to say this except Mac and Devin Go to High School is bad ‚Äì plain and simple. The on-screen collaboration between these two Hip-Hop heavyweights is a joke, and for their sakes, hopefully a joke that they and everyone involved with Mac and Devin were in on. At the end of the day, the only thing that Mac and Devin Go to High School proves is that we need How High 2, and we need it bad!\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club also gave the film a negative review, saying \\"The prot√©g√© completes his evolution when he uses his high-school valedictorian speech to perform 'Young, Wild & Free,' the hit single from Mac & Devin Go To High School. 'Young, Wild & Free' is everything Mac & Devin Go To High School should be but isn‚Äôt: fun, light, goofy, entertaining, and young. In moments like this, the movie possesses a strange, disarming innocence, but it forces audiences to endure a punishing gauntlet of misogyny and non-starting comedy to get to that middling moment of moderate enjoyment.\\" References External links * Category:2012 films Category:American films about cannabis Category:American films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:2010s buddy comedy films Category:2012 comedy films ","title":"Mac &amp; Devin Go to High School"},{"id":"47778272","text":"Clarence Henry Reid (February 14, 1939 ‚Äì January 17, 2016) was an American musician, songwriter and producer, also known by the stage name and alternate persona Blowfly. Early life and career Reid was born in Cochran, Georgia, in 1939 and moved to West Palm Beach, Florida in his adolescence (c. 1949). His stage name was given to him by his grandmother who he would visit in Georgia occasionally. During this time, Reid would make explicit parodies of the country music that was popular on the airwaves in Cochran then, prompting his grandmother to brand him a \\"blowfly\\". > \\"In hillbilly, you'll find some of the best lyrics and morals. I used to > listen to Homer and Jethro, and they would rap most of the time, only they > didn't call it rap then. They used to call it soul talkin'. As a form of > revenge, I would take songs like \\"The Twist,\\" and I would change it from > (sings) \\"Come on baby, let's do the twist\\" to \\"Come on baby, and suck my > d-!\\" My grandma would say that's terrible, you're a poor excuse for a human > being. Child, you're nastier than a blowfly.\\" During the 1960s and 1970s he wrote for and produced artists including Betty Wright, Sam & Dave, Gwen McCrae, Jimmy \\"Bo\\" Horne, Bobby Byrd, and KC & the Sunshine Band. During this period he was also a recording artist, cutting many of his own songs, including \\"Nobody But You Babe\\" and his first XXX record, \\"Oddballs\\" which was reworked into \\"Rapp Dirty\\" several years later. Reid wrote sexually explicit versions of hit songs for fun but only performed them for his friends at parties or in the studio. In 1971, he along with a band of studio musicians, recorded a whole album of these songs under the name Blowfly. The album, The Weird World of Blowfly, features Reid dressed as a low-rent supervillain on its cover. He created this alter ego to protect his career as a songwriter, and continued to perform in bizarre costumes as his Blowfly character and record sexually explicit albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Reid claimed to be one of the first artists to perform in a mask, and transitioned from a \\"tuxedo like Dracula\\" or a \\"buttless\\" Clint Eastwood inspired outfit, to the spandex suits that he is now known for in response to public demand. The albums were widely popular as \\"party records\\". The explicit version of his song \\"Rapp Dirty\\" (a.k.a. \\"Blowfly's Rapp\\") helped the album Blowfly's Party reach No. 26 on Billboard Magazine's black albums chart and No. 82 on the Billboard Top 200 in 1980. Blowfly's profane style earned Reid legal trouble. He was sued by songwriter Stanley Adams, who was ASCAP president at the time, for spoofing \\"What a Diff'rence a Day Makes\\" as \\"What a Difference a Lay Makes\\". Reid's own compositions have been sampled by dozens of hip hop, R&B;, and electronic artists (such as Beyonce, Wu Tang Clan, DJ Quik, DMX, Method Man & Redman, Main Source, DJ Shadow, Eazy-E, RJD2, Jurassic 5, Big Daddy Kane, Mary J. Blige, Brand Nubian, and the Avalanches) but Reid received almost no money from sampling due to signing away most of his royalties. Blowfly's Zodiac Blowfly LP (also released on CD in 1996 on Weird World Records) includes the songs \\"If Eating You Is Wrong, I Don't Want To Be Right\\", \\"The First Time Ever You Sucked My Dick\\", and \\"Ain't No Head Like My Woman's Head\\", as well as a version of \\"Clean Up Woman\\", which he co-wrote. Another album of this period is The Weird World of Blowfly. =2000s= In 2003, Blowfly sold the rights to his entire catalog after years of debt. The catalog was said to be worth millions of unpaid royalties. After 17 years of sporadic touring and occasional re-recording of his classic raps, Blowfly signed with Jello Biafra's independent record label Alternative Tentacles in 2005. Fahrenheit 69, the first album under the new contract, featured appearances from Slug of Atmosphere, King Coleman, Gravy Train, and Afroman. Blowfly's Punk Rock Party, a 2006 album release from Alternative Tentacles, features several punk rock classics given the Blowfly treatment‚Äîincluding a rewrite of the Dead Kennedys song \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\" recast as \\"R. Kelly in Cambodia\\", which features Biafra (the song's composer and original singer) playing a trial judge. The album also includes \\"I Wanna Be Fellated\\", \\"Gotta Keep Her Penetrated\\", \\"I Wanna Fuck Your Dog\\" and \\"Should I Fuck This Big Fat Ho?\\". Blowfly completed his first tour of Australia in March 2007, and toured Germany with Die √Ñrzte in 2008. He performed at the 2010 Big Day Out music festival, held in Australia and New Zealand. The Weird World of Blowfly, directed by Jonathan Furmanski, premiered at South by Southwest in 2010 and received a wider release in September 2011. =Illness and death= On January 12, 2016, Blowfly drummer \\"Uncle\\" Tom Bowker announced in a statement on the Blowfly Facebook page that Reid was suffering from terminal liver cancer and had been admitted to a hospice facility in Florida. According to Bowker, the singer would release his final LP ‚Äì entitled 77 Rusty Trombones ‚Äì in February 2016. Reid died on January 17, 2016, from cancer and multiple organ failure at the hospice facility in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, aged 76. Family Reid's daughter is former WNBA player Tracy Reid.

Life He was born the son of Sir Henry Halford, 2nd Baronet, MP for Leicestershire South, whom he succeeded in 1868. He was educated at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1849. On his father's death he inherited Wistow Hall in Leicestershire, where he thereafter lived. In 1860 he took command of a company of the Leicestershire volunteers, becoming colonel of the battalion in 1862. He held the office, with a 10-year break, until 1891, when he was made honorary colonel. In 1886, he was awarded C.B. He was picked High Sheriff of Leicestershire for 1872, and in 1889 was appointed the first Chairman of Leicestershire County Council, a post he held until 1893. His main interest was rifle shooting and the development of rifle technology. He was an excellent shot and won several tournaments. In 1877 he was captain of a team of eight who shot a match against an American team and also took part in similar matches in 1882 and 1883. He was for many years Chairman of the National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom. He was also a member of the government Small Arms Committee which recommended the adoption in the Army of the Lee-Metford rifle. Sir Henry had worked closely with William Ellis Metford, inventor of the rifle, establishing a workshop and firing range at Wistow Hall to help with the experimental work. Another collaborator on the project was his friend Thomas Fremantle, 3rd Baron Cottesloe, who was also an expert shot. The team made significant improvements in rifling and bullet design. Family He married Elizabeth Ursula, daughter of John Bagshawe but had no children. The baronetcy thereby passed briefly to his brother John Frederick, who died later the same year.

A power broker at the center of a local community, YBMB was held out as a model of African American economic self-sufficiency. However, it was later linked to widespread physical and sexual abuse, welfare fraud, and murder. After Bey's death in 2003, YBMB fell into debt and declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2006. In August 2007, in connection with investigations into the murder of Oakland Post journalist Chauncey Bailey and a number of other crimes, police conducted a massive raid on the company's San Pablo Avenue bakery. A concurrent health inspection resulted in its closure. Later that day a court ordered the pending reorganization converted into a liquidation bankruptcy. Origins Bakery menu Yusuf Bey, born Joseph Stephens, came to Oakland, California with his family from Texas in the early 1950s. He later opened beauty salons in the San Francisco Bay Area and in southern California, before going into the bakery business. After discovering the teachings of Elijah Muhammad in the 1960s, Bey converted to the Nation of Islam (NOI) in 1964, and founded the \\"Islamic\\" bakery in Santa Barbara in 1968. The bakery was not affiliated with the NOI, though similarities were evident. Nation of Islam minister Keith Muhammad, of East Oakland's Muhammad Mosque #26, stated that the two organizations are distinct and separate. The baked goods Bey sold were prepared in accordance with the Qur'an, and were free of refined sugar and preservatives. Bey named the business Your Black Muslim Bakery (YBMB) on the personal recommendation of Elijah Muhammad, who had become his spiritual guide. In 1971, Bey moved the bakery to Oakland. By 1974 it was the \\"largest Bay Area bakery specializing exclusively in natural food products\\", with over 6,000 loaves of bread and over 300 cakes per week sold at 150 stores.\\"Scarfing\\", The Oakland Tribune, June 6, 1974(subscription)retrieved February 19, 2008) During the mid-1980s, Bey appeared regularly on a local Oakland cable television lecture program, True Solutions, during which he broadcast his hour-long sermons every week. On the program Bey also promoted the bakery, and frequently expounded on the need for the economic self-reliance and \\"knowledge of self\\" of African Americans, whom he lectured the audience as being the \\"Original Man\\", a racially-charged idea derived from the NOI's doctrine of Yakub. By the 1990s, YBMB and its leaders were a respected part of Oakland society, and had substantial influence in local politics. They used their power to obtain favors from the city, influence local elections, and avoid scrutiny from police. By 2007, the company was headquartered at 5832 San Pablo Avenue, with five branch locations listed in Alameda County records, including a store on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland's Temescal district and another at Oakland International Airport. The bakery also had a location at the Oakland Coliseum.  Yusuf Bey era controversies  =Akbar Bey= Your Black Muslim Bakery #1, May 2002. In 1994, Bey's son Akbar was shot four times and killed by a local drug dealer outside the Omni nightclub near the corner of Shattuck Avenue and 50th Street. Court records showed the pathologist's conclusion that Akbar was high on heroin or morphine at the time of his death. An Oakland police lieutenant described Akbar as \\"a little street thug\\" once seen well armed and wearing a bulletproof vest in a blatant show of force to the police. Three months before his killing, Akbar had been charged with felony counts of carrying a concealed weapon and evading the police, resulting in a car chase and crash at 44th Street and Market Street. =1994 Nedir and Abaz Bey trial= On March 4, 1994, Nedir Bey was involved in the torture and beating of a Nigerian home- seller in an apartment on the 500 block of 24th Street in Oakland, involving a real estate deal. The apartment complex served as a compound for the Bey organization. The extremely violent incident also involved Abaz Bey. Both Abaz and Nedir Bey were standing members of the African-American Advisory Committee on Crime, which also included Oakland's then-mayor Elihu Harris. The committee had organized a massive conference on crime that same weekend, featuring Jesse Jackson as its keynote speaker. The assault escalated into a massive incident in which ninety Oakland Police officers were engaged in hand-to-hand combat with thirty Black Muslims, some of whom were armed. The two Beys and two other men were charged with felony counts of assault, robbery, and false imprisonment. A year later, all four men pleaded no contest to one felony count of false imprisonment. The prosecutors had cut a plea deal, in part because they could not get any tenant witnesses to talk from the apartment complex where the Bey organization stationed its members as security, like a private compound. Nedir Bey served six months of home detention, and Abaz Bey got eight months' home detention. =1994 Bey mayoral run= Primarily through the lobbying and orchestrating done by Nedir Bey, who was the public face of the Bey organization, Yusuf Bey cultivated the patronage of Oakland's civic, political, and religious leaders. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1994, gaining 5% of the vote. =1996 City loan= In 1996, the City of Oakland loaned YBMB $1.1 million to start a home health care business. The loan was never repaid, and the home health care business never was established. =Yusuf Bey rape trial= Bey's detractors‚Äînotably East Bay Express journalist Chris Thompson‚Äîaccused him of cultism, corruption, and antisemitism. Many accusations of physical and sexual abuse, including rape and incest, and which were sustained by DNA evidence, were made against Bey, culminating in felony charges which were pending at the time of his death. On September 19, 2002, Bey turned himself in to Oakland Police when a warrant was issued for his arrest, charged with 27 counts in the alleged rapes of four girls under the age of 14. The cases were pending trial into the following year. The oldest allegation was that, beginning twenty years earlier, he serially raped through coercion a preteen girl who, as a ten-year-old, came under foster care of Bey and his wife Nora Bey. Bey died of cancer in October 2003 at age 67 while the first case was awaiting trial.  Second-generation controversies  =Waajid Bey= Interior of the bakery, May 2002. The plaque on top grants cum laude status to Mohammed S. Bey from Howard University. Following the death of Yusuf Bey in 2003, Waajid Aliawaad Bey became chief executive officer of YBMB. In March 2004, at age 51, he disappeared for several months, until the discovery of his badly decomposed body in a shallow grave off Skyline Blvd. in the Oakland Hills. He was determined to be the victim of a homicide. = Antar Bey = YBMB was then taken over by Yusuf Bey's son, Antar Bey. At age 23 on October 25, 2005, Antar was in turn shot to death in what police believe to have been a failed carjacking while he was stopped to get gas on Martin Luther King Jr. Way, near 55th Street. On December 14, 2007, Alfonza Phillips III was sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder. Another son, Yusuf Bey IV, took over YBMB in October 2005. = Yusuf Bey IV = In November 2005, two liquor stores in Oakland were vandalized, one of which was captured on a store surveillance tape. Another store was burned, and a store owner was briefly abducted by men wearing the distinctive bow-tie apparel associated with the NOI. The men had demanded that the stores stop selling alcohol to African Americans. Yusuf Bey IV was among those arrested in the case, and he was charged with having led the attacks. In February 2006, in nearby Vallejo, Yusuf IV was arrested and later found guilty of a number of crimes related to his scheme to buy a $55,000 luxury Mercedes- Benz from a used-car lot by using false credit information and identification. He was also charged with trying to open a bank account with the false information. Vallejo police dropped charges concerning a 9mm pistol and ammunition which had been found in the car. Yusuf IV was arrested in San Francisco on assault charges in April 2006, after allegedly trying to run down three security guards outside a strip club in his BMW, after he had been thrown out. Then he was charged with missing several court dates, for which he became wanted on a $375,000 warrant. According to later court documents, he also used a stolen identification with a fake driver's license to fraudulently obtain favorable credit to buy a house in the 2500 block of 61st Avenue. Yusuf IV signed all the documents with the name Yasir Human. The US$550,000 loan was through CIT Group/Consumer Finance Inc. = Sayyed Yusuf Bey = Portrait of Sayyed Yusuf Bey Sayyed Yusuf \\"Weedy\\" Bey was one of the elder Yusuf Bey's older sons. After graduating from the Elijah Education Center in 1994, he joined the True Solutions production team as a camera operator and worked as a baker at YBMB. Sayyed also had a minor role in the 1998 feature film Drylongso. That year, he also moved to Los Angeles to pursue his passion of exotic automobiles and became the owner of Quick N Shine Auto Detail, working with celebrities such as the Wayans family. On February 24, 2009, Sayyed took his own life on Burnside Ave, Los Angeles. Due to Yusuf IV's pending murder trial, the Bey family didn't publish any obituary notices in Los Angeles. = 2006 bankruptcy = On October 24, 2006, YBMB filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. With $900,000 in debts, owed mostly to the mortgage holder, the bakery building was about to be foreclosed upon. The remaining debt, $200,000, was owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The day after the murder of Chauncey Bailey, on August 3, 2007, Judge Edward Jellen ordered the case to be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation effective August 9.  Political fallout  It was revealed that three local prominent elected officials wrote letters in July 2007 to Judge Jellen asking him not to dissolve YBMB to pay off creditors. Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, and California Assemblyman Sandr√© Swanson all wrote letters at the request of longtime YBMB associate Ali Saleem Bey. Lee later expressed regret for her support. Dellums' office offered the explanation that Ali said that he hoped to gain control of YBMB, and return it to its historical roots. Swanson's letter was dated July 17, 2007 and his office first admitted to having \\"made a mistake\\", and also stated that Swanson was not aware of the bakery leaders' legal problems. However, later Swanson's office stated that the letter was a routine response to a routine request such as they receive from small businesses, and that the earlier statement did not represent the official position of the assemblyman. Elmhurst-East Oakland City Council member Larry Reid said that he had refused the request by Bey to write a similar letter of support for YBMB in July, because the bakery had failed to repay the 1996 loan and because of the well-publicized criminal charges that had been brought against Bey organization leaders by that time, including the 2005 liquor store incidents. Reid said he respects the old guard of the bakery represented by John and Ali Bey, but that was not enough. = 2006 Health Code violations = On December 19, 2006, YBMB's San Pablo Avenue bakery headquarters received four \\"major\\" health code violations, with dangerously unsanitary conditions, during a restaurant inspection by the Alameda County Environmental Health Department. The conditions were grave enough to risk immediate closure, if not fixed immediately, according to department policy. However, the bakery remained open, and no follow-up inspection was recorded by the department. The major violations included issues with grease, lack of smooth and cleanable surfaces, lack of adequate stove hood venting, and inadequate lighting. In addition inspectors cited four minor violations involving employee behavior and cleanliness. = May 2007 kidnapping = Oakland Police say that three men associated with YBMB, including Yusuf IV, later confessed to May 17, 2007 kidnapping of two women, a mother and daughter, and tortured the latter. According to court records and a police affidavit, 20-year-old Joshua Bey and 21-year-old Tamon Oshun Halfin staked out the women at a bingo parlor at Foothill Square in East Oakland. Halfin and Joshua admitted that Yusuf IV ordered them to keep watch, and to notify him when the two women left. The men believed that both the women and a male friend had a lot of cash, which the Beys and Halfin were trying to get for the bakery. Joshua and Halfin were riding in a fake police car, with flashing lights, which was registered to Yusuf IV. The car pulled the women over on Interstate 580. Wearing dark clothing and masks, the two men took the women at gunpoint into the fake police car. A third man was behind the wheel. The men covered the women's heads and drove off, while the third man followed them, driving the women's car. They ended up at a house in the 6800 block of Avenal Avenue, a couple miles from the bingo parlor. Police said that YBMB owned the house as a rental. The mother was left inside the car while the daughter was taken inside the house, where she was tortured, hit in the head and knee with a hard object, and was threatened with being set on fire. An Oakland Police officer in the area that night, looking for a stolen car, spotted the fake police car with the mother inside and, when he stopped to investigate, the men fled the house. The daughter broke a window of the house and called for help, and the mother was then found by police unharmed. A cell phone found in the house belonged to Joshua. Joshua and Halfin were later among those arrested in the raid on the bakery. Police later held Yusuf IV without bail for kidnapping for ransom in the case. = July 2007 double homicide = The later YBMB investigation and arrests may also relate to a double homicide that occurred near the bakery a couple months after the May kidnappings. On July 8, 2007, one victim was killed in the 1000 block of 60th Street. Then on July 12, 2007, another victim, Mike Wills Jr., was gunned down in the 6200 block of San Pablo Avenue. On August 6, the police, without filing charges, stated that the two murders were committed with an AK-47 found at the bakery during the August raid. Devaughndre Broussard said Antoine Mackey killed Wills because he was white, and Mackey and Bey had been inspired by the racially motivated Zebra murders. = July 2007 kidnapping = Another case linked to arrestees in the later YBMB raid involved yet another kidnapping on July 19, 2007 of some women for ransom, before they escaped their captors.  Murder of Chauncey Bailey  Before his shooting death in August 2007, editor Chauncey Bailey of the Oakland Post was working on a story about the finances of YBMB, involving its pending bankruptcy. Ali Saleem Bey was Bailey's source for the story, which the Post withheld on the belief that it was not yet ready for publication. According to Ali, YBMB had been seized from its rightful heirs in a coup, through fraud and forgery, by a younger branch of the family, that included Antar Bey and Yusef Bey IV. Ali revealed that in June 2005, John Bey, a former head of the Bey security service who had tried to expose the fraud behind the coup, fled Oakland with his family after an attempt on his life in a shooting outside his home. In 2005, Antar mortgaged the bakery property, to cover back taxes and other debt, and then defaulted, which led to threat of foreclosure. On the morning of August 2, 2007, Bailey was murdered in Downtown Oakland by Devaughndre Broussard, a 19-year-old YBMB handyman who was on probation for a San Francisco robbery conviction, had found out where Bailey lived. At 7:25 a.m. Broussard spotted Bailey leaving a McDonald's restaurant where Bailey regularly stopped to eat breakfast. Wearing a ski mask and dark clothing, he then got out of a parked Ford Aerostar and approached Bailey with a Mossberg shotgun. Broussard's first blast hit Bailey in the chest, after which he stood over him and fired at his face execution style, and then fired a coup de gr√¢ce to make sure he was dead. He then escaped in the van. Broussard admitted to police the next night that he then ambushed and killed Bailey. Oakland Police investigators said that he confessed to the murder because he was angry over the past and ongoing articles written by Bailey about YBMB and its personnel.  Closure of bakery and conviction  The Alameda County Health Department closed YBMB after rat droppings were found inside the bakery and dead rats found on the rooftop, along with other waste which was leaking into drainage lines. As a result, police officers called in Oakland's Vector Control during the raid, along with the state of California Department of Fish and Game and the Alameda Country District Attorney's Office environmental crimes unit. Pending fines could have reached up to $5,000 per day. On August 4, 2007, Broussard was booked on suspicion of murder for the killing of Bailey, having told police detectives that he considered himself \\"a good soldier.\\" Yusuf IV was also arrested that day on the outstanding San Francisco warrant, and held without bail in the May kidnapping-for-ransom case. His brother Joshua, Halfin and one of the other arrestees from the morning prior were being held in connection with the earlier kidnappings, including the assault of the one woman in May. On August 7, Broussard was arraigned in Alameda County Superior Court for Bailey's murder, and also charged with being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and with having a prior felony conviction from San Francisco. In August 2011, he was sentenced to 25 years in state prison. On June 11, 2011, Yusuf IV was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.http://www.bet.com/news/national/2011/06/10/the-man-behind-editor- chauncey-bailey-s-killing-faces-a-life-term.html In 2015, a state appeals court upheld the convictions of Yusuf Bey IV and Antoine Mackey.

He was shot dead on a Downtown Oakland street on August 2, 2007, the victim of a crime syndicate he was investigating for a story. Bailey's death outraged fellow journalists, who joined together to create the Chauncey Bailey Project dedicated to continuing his work and uncovering the facts of his murder. In June 2011, Yusuf Bey IV, the owner of Your Black Muslim Bakery, and his associate Antoine Mackey were convicted of ordering Bailey's murder. A third man, bakery handyman Devaughndre Brousard, had earlier confessed to being the triggerman. Bailey was the first American journalist killed for domestic reporting since 1976. Circumstances Chauncey Bailey had been working on a story about the finances of Your Black Muslim Bakery (YBMB), which was on the verge of bankruptcy. Oakland Post publisher Paul Cobb later revealed that, prior to Bailey's killing, Cobb had withheld from publication a story that he had written earlier, saying only that it was about \\"things like\\" what happened to Bailey. Cobb later stated that the police had asked him not to reveal anything about the matter. A former YBMB employee, Ali Saleem Bey who is not a relative of the bakery's owner, but who adopted the Bey name revealed that he was Bailey's source for the withheld story, which the Post had decided was not ready for publication. Bailey had asked Ali Bey to give him information for the story. According to Ali Bey, YBMB had been seized from its rightful heirs in a coup, through fraud and forgery, by a younger branch of the Bey family, including Antar Bey and Yusuf Bey IV, the bakery's CEO. In June 2005, John Bey, the former head of the Bey security service who had tried to expose the fraud behind the YBMB coup, fled Oakland with his family after an attempt on his life in a shooting outside his home. In 2005, Antar mortgaged the YBMB property to cover back taxes and other debt, and then defaulted, which led to threat of foreclosure. An attorney for the Post confirmed that Bailey had been working on the story about the \\"financial status of the organization\\" and including the possibly criminal \\"activities of a number of people who were working in the organization\\". On October 24, 2006, YBMB filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. With $900,000 in debts, owed mostly to the mortgage holder, the bakery building was about to be foreclosed upon. The remaining debt, $200,000, was owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The day after Bailey's death, on August 3, 2007, Judge Edward Jellen ordered the case to be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation effective August 9. Final days By the summer of 2007, Bailey was living in an apartment near the south end of Lake Merritt, not far from Downtown Oakland. His regular morning routine involved walking to work along 14th Street, which included a stop to eat breakfast at a McDonald's restaurant at corner of Jackson Street. On the morning of August 2, Bailey was being followed by a white Ford Aerostar van carrying Devaughndre Broussard, a 19-year-old YBMB employee who was on probation for a San Francisco robbery conviction. Broussard had worked at the bakery as a handyman and cook between August 2006 and March 2007, before leaving to find other work. He was rehired at the bakery in July 2007. =Murder= At 7:25 a.m. Broussard spotted Bailey leaving the McDonald's restaurant. At around 7:30 a.m., after the van was parked on Alice Street, Broussard wearing a ski mask and dark clothing approached Bailey at the 200 block of 14th Street, wieling a Mossberg shotgun. One witness said Bailey said: \\"Please don't kill me.\\" This witness claimed he recognized Bailey, and that he was in trouble, but stopped in his tracks when he saw the shotgun. Other witnesses said Broussard fired at least three rounds from the shotgun. Broussard's first shot hit Bailey in the chest. He then stood over Bailey and fired again execution style at his face, before finally firing a coup de gr√¢ce to make sure he was dead. Broussard then ran back to the waiting van and fled. Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene. Bailey was survived by his father, three of his four siblings, and his teenage son living in southern California. A funeral Mass for Bailey was held at the East Oakland St. Benedict's Catholic Church on the morning of August 8, 2007, with an overflow crowd of 700 in attendance, including a line of people outside for more than an hour into the service. Attendees included Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, U.S. Representative Barbara Lee, and well-known local attorney John Burris. Bailey was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in nearby Hayward. Suspects = Shooter = Devaughndre Broussard grew up in San Francisco's Western Addition district. In January 2006, at age 18, he pleaded guilty to an assault charge and served a first-time offender sentence of one year in San Francisco County Jail. Upon release, he was further ordered to three years of supervised probation. In addition to his probation status, Broussard was wanted on an outstanding failure-to-appear warrant for his arrest, charged with a 2006 assault with a firearm in San Francisco. On the night of August 1, 2007, Broussard first went looking for Bailey at his apartment complex, having discovered his residence near the south end of Lake Merritt. Early on the next morning of August 2, Broussard looked for Bailey at his office at the Post, but Bailey had not yet arrived. Broussard also went looking for Bailey twice again at his apartment complex that morning. At 7:17 a.m. an AC Transit bus driver reported seeing a man, who may have been Broussard, standing near Bailey's apartment complex at First Avenue and International Boulevard with a shotgun. The driver called his dispatcher, who reported the incident to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The driver continued on his route, and deputies responded to the location, but could not locate the man in their search. =Yusuf Bey IV= Yusuf Bey IV was born in Oakland in 1986, the son of Yusuf Bey, the founder of YBMB, and Daulet Bey, one of multiple women who the elder Yusuf took as his wives. His life was marred by arrests and accusations of serious crimes. Yusuf's father was said to have fathered forty-two children by these women at the time of his death in 2003. He had one legal wife, Farieda Bey, but no other formal marriages took place. Bey claimed he had \\"spiritually\\" adopted his followers, who all took his surname. People who worked for YBMB were considered \\"members\\" of the business and the mosque from which the bakery had grown. The younger Yusuf had several run-ins with the law, including a 2001 arrest in El Cerrito for failing to stop at a stop sign and possessing a loaded firearm magazine; he was 15 years old at the time. Yusuf's father also had a shady criminal history, but remained uncharged with any wrongdoing until he was accused of lewd conduct in 2002 by a girl who he had raised as a foster child. While DNA evidence was conclusive enough for prosecutors to schedule a court date for the elder Yusuf, but he died of cancer before the trial could begin. The incident scandalized the surrounding community, which had admired the elder Yusuf because of his renowned business, his association with prominent politicians, his support for black empowerment, and his supposed adherence to his Black Muslim faith. =Battle for control of the bakery= After the death of the elder Yusuf, one of his followers, Waajid Aljawwaad (who sometimes used the additional last name of Bey), became the CEO of YBMB as his designated successor. However, on February 27, 2004, Aljawwaad failed to arrive for work at the bakery. His body, bound with electrical tape and wrapped in a tarpaulin, was found in Oakland Hills in July of that year. No one was ever charged with the murder. Antar Bey, Daulet and Yusuf Bey's son and older brother of Yusuf Bey IV, seized control of YBMB. Antar's half siblings and their mothers protested and fought with him over control of the business, but to no avail; he was able to retain control and force them out. He soon took out $700,000 in loans that went into default. However, in October 2005, Antar was killed in a carjacking in Oakland. Authorities suspected Yusuf IV of ordering Antar's execution but could not provide proof. Oakland police charged a man unrelated to the bakery with the murder. After Antar's death, Yusuf IV took full control of YBMB. Bakery ownership years (2005‚Äì2007) Yusuf IV seemed primarily interested in YBMB's profits and the power over the members of the business his father had engendered, not the day-to-day operation of the business itself. He alternately took money from YBMB and conducted various fraudulent operations to support himself and the business before it failed. Yusuf IV continued his father's practice of delivering fiery Black Muslim sermons to bakery followers, including one videotaped sermon from July 2007, where he asserted, \\"We fight the government, we fight the police, we fight our own families, we fight our own people, and we fight Caucasian people daily‚Äîjust to do right.\\" Some of the crimes Bey IV committed during this period included theft by deception and forgery involving the purchase of several cars; fraudulent sub-prime home loan applications; possession of a firearm after attempting to open a checking account using forged identification; and a bizarre kidnapping and assault on a woman Yusuf IV believed was connected with drug dealers who owed him money, or whom he could rob. Despite several arrests, he remained free and flouted subpoenas and court dates. His lawyer said at the time, \\"The view was, 'We're Black Muslims, we can do anything we want.' They got sucked in. I thought it was 'acting out' behavior. But it caused just a whirlwind of trouble.\\" Criminal record Below are some of the charges and arrests for Yusuf Bey IV. * In November 2005, Yusuf IV was charged with grand theft for fraud connected with the purchase of a 2002 Mercedes from a Vallejo car dealership. He used a stolen identity to buy the car and pleaded no contest when the crime was discovered. A Solano County judge allowed him to remain free. * That same month, a group of men in suits, presumably led by Yusuf IV, stormed two Muslim-owned stores that sold liquor. The men destroyed wine in cases and groceries. He later claimed, \\"If you say you're a Muslim, you should have the action of a Muslim,\\" and that alcohol was \\"killing our people\\". * In 2006, Yusuf IV was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after he tried to run over the bouncer of a San Francisco strip club from which he'd been ejected. * In June 2006, Yusuf IV purchased a home in Oakland using falsified information. The sub-prime loan involved a first and second mortgage, and investigators later theorized the motive was to obtain money from the home's equity. The loan went into default in October. Yusuf IV used his own Social Security number but a driver's license with a falsified name for the loan paperwork. Later, investigators discovered that he and his associates had purchased a total of five homes, most of which were in default. * That same month, Yusuf IV and associates used false information to buy three cars from a San Bruno dealership, which later resulted in charges of grand theft. Yusuf IV used the same name to purchase the cars that he had used to purchase the house in Oakland. One of the accomplices later said he could not remember using a false name or several other details of the fraudulent car purchase or the liquor store vandalism, in which he also allegedly participated. * In May 2007, Bey IV and four men kidnapped a woman and took her to the home of Bey's brother-in-law. The men beat the blindfolded woman and demanded money supposedly owed to Bey IV. While the crime was in progress, police saw a Ford Crown Victoria, a car often used by police, outside the house and grew suspicious. Police went to the door and the men fled on foot, leaving their cars behind. The police confiscated the vehicles as evidence and Joshua Bey, Bey IV's half-brother, was arrested. Since the arrest, Bey IV has alternately admitted and denied various aspects of this crime. * Bey IV wanted Alfonza Phillips Sr., the father of the man who killed Antar Bey, executed. But because Bey IV's accomplice Devaughndre Broussard could not find Phillips, Bey IV told him to kill another relative of the carjacker, Odell Roberson. In July 2007, Broussard, who was 19, found Roberson. Antoine Mackey, another member of the bakery, handed him a rifle, and Broussard shot the unarmed man. He said at trial that he had fired eight or ten rounds and carried out the murder \\"because Yusuf Bey IV told me to\\". * Later in 2007, Bey IV, Antoine Mackey and Devaughndre Broussard were driving around Oakland discussing the \\"Zebra\\" murders. Bey IV or Broussard saw Michael Wills, a white man who worked as a chef, returning to work on foot after purchasing a pack of cigarettes. Bey IV and his accomplices discussed who should kill Wills and Mackey volunteered. He got out of the car and shot Wills six times. The three left the scene and returned to the bakery compound. Investigation and trial for murder On the day of the killing Oakland Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland offered up to $25,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of the killer. Beginning early at 5 a.m. on the following morning of August 3, 2007, more than 200 Oakland police officers and SWAT team members armed with search warrants closed off a number of blocks of San Pablo Avenue, a major thoroughfare in North Oakland. The area of focus included homes and the business properties of Your Black Muslim Bakery, which operated two business locations on either side of the street between Stanford Avenue and 59th Street. The group is a Black Muslim splinter organization founded by Yusuf Bey, and now led by his son Yusuf Bey IV. The pre-dawn raids followed a two-month investigation into a variety of violent crimes, including kidnapping and murder. Police used stun grenades and broke down doors to gain entry. In a news conference later that day, Oakland Deputy Police Chief Howard Jordan said that several weapons and other evidence of value linked the killing of Chauncey Bailey to members of the group. Police also recovered spent ammunition from the rooftops, and detained 19 people for questioning. In addition to the bakeries, the police also raided nearby homes. In the 1000 block of 59th Street, police recovered, from a closet, the shotgun used in the killing of Bailey at the home where Broussard was also detained. The rear yard of the home connected directly to the bakery property. Police also raided a home in the 900 block of Aileen Street a few blocks east of the bakery. Of the 19 detainees on that morning, five were arrested along with Broussard, and Yusuf Bey IV, on probable cause arrest warrants, along with other outstanding arrest warrants, stemming from the prior investigations. Broussard was booked on suspicion of murder on August 4, 2007, for the killing of Bailey, having told police detectives that he considered himself \\"a good soldier\\". Though other charges were made against those arrested, none of them were charged with Bailey's murder. On August 7 Broussard was arraigned in Alameda County Superior Court, on charges of murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Broussard initially confessed to killing Bailey, then recanted his confession. In a 2008 60 Minutes interview, Broussard claimed he was coerced by Yusuf Bey IV to plead guilty for the benefit of the bakery and others arrested. In an interview for CBS News, Broussard said that the Oakland Police put him and Bey IV together in a room, and that Bey IV convinced him to plead guilty for the purpose of releasing other murder suspects. He later pled guilty to manslaughter charges in exchange for a 25-year sentence and full testimony at the trial of Bey IV and others. In June 2008 a videotape of Bey IV in custody whispering to his half-brother Joshua Bey and another bakery associate, Tamon Halfin, and disclosing details of Bailey's murder was obtained and posted by the Chauncey Bailey Project. Journalists from the Chauncey Bailey Project created a transcription of the conversation which seemed to indicate Bey was involved in Bailey's murder. A grand jury indicted Bey IV with ordering the execution of Chauncey Bailey in April 2009, almost two years after the murder. Broussard testified for the prosecution at the trial of Bey IV and Antoine Mackey in 2011. He stated in court that Bey ordered him to find, track and kill Bailey before the journalist could print his latest article on the bakery. On June 9, 2011 Bey IV and Mackey were both convicted by a trial jury of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Yusuf Bey IV was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder. In 2013 Bey's attorney, Lorna Brown, was convicted of smuggling documents out of jail for him. One of the documents, a hit list ordering an associate to kill a witness, was intercepted by police before the associate could carry out the murder. In 2015, a state appeals court upheld the convictions of Yusuf Bey IV and Antoine Mackey.http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/2-lose-appeal-in-killing-of- Oakland-journalist-6018383.php Bey IV also threatened former bakery followers to intimidate them from testifying against him. Based on recorded calls between Bey IV and follower Kahlil Raheem, Bey first cajoled and then warned Raheem not to testify against him. As the trial progressed, allegations of intimidation by Bey IV and other former bakery members persisted. The Contra Costa Times editorialized on April 30, 2011, that the intimidation must stop and that the judge, Thomas Reardon, along with bailiffs and the sheriff should get control of the trial to allow justice to be done. Some witnesses called to testify changed their story from the original information they gave the police or said they did not remember what happened. A man who worked at the convenience store that Bey IV allegedly attacked with his followers said he did not remember over 50 times at trial. Even Broussard testified later that he does not remember Bey IV giving him specific orders to kill Odell Roberson or Chauncey Bailey.

He served as editor-in-chief of The Oakland Post in Oakland, California from June 2007 until his murder. His 37-year career in journalism included lengthy periods as a reporter at The Detroit News and The Oakland Tribune. He was shot dead on a Downtown Oakland street on August 2, 2007, the victim of a crime syndicate he was investigating for a story. His death outraged fellow journalists, who joined together to create the Chauncey Bailey Project dedicated to continuing his work and uncovering the facts of his murder. In June 2011 Yusuf Bey IV, a local bakery owner, and his associate Antoine Mackey were convicted of ordering Bailey's murder. A third man, bakery handyman Devaughndre Brousard, had earlier confessed to being the triggerman. Bailey was the first American journalist killed for domestic reporting since 1976. Biography =Early years= Chauncey was born in Oakland, California into a Catholic family who were members of St. Benedict's Catholic Church on 82nd Avenue. He lived in East Oakland neighborhoods for many years and attended Hayward High School in the nearby city of Hayward. Bailey earned an associate degree from Oakland's old Merritt Community College in 1968, and a Bachelors in Journalism from San Jose State University in 1972. =Career= Bailey first wrote for The Oakland Post in 1970, and made his foray into television news that year as an on-air reporter with station KNTV in San Jose, California, where he continued through 1971. During the next three years he worked at the San Francisco Sun Reporter. In the mid-1970s, Bailey moved to Hartford, Connecticut to work on the Hartford Courant for three years. After working for a year on the rewrite desk at United Press International in Chicago, he returned to Oakland in 1978 and wrote for the California Voice through late 1980. Bailey again moved to Chicago, where he worked as a publicist for the nonprofit Comprand Inc., and then relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1981 to work for a year as press secretary for the freshman U.S. Representative Gus Savage, D-Ill. From 1982 Bailey spent the next decade as a reporter and columnist for the Detroit News, where he covered city government and worked on special projects. In 1992 he returned to Oakland as public affairs director and newscaster on Bay Area radio with station KDIA, which was co-owned by then mayor of Oakland, Elihu Harris and then California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. During this era Bailey was seen throughout the 1990s as an interviewer and commentator on Soul Beat Television on the Oakland cable station KSBT, where he worked along with former Oakland actress Luenell. Bailey worked at the Oakland Tribune from 1993 until 2005. In the mid-1990s Bailey split from his wife. In 2003 Bailey quit his program on Soul Beat after he failed in his attempt to buy the station. His program was canceled in 2004. In 2005 he began writing freelance travel stories for The Oakland Post. He became editor in June 2007, and then editor-in-chief of all five Post weeklies. The Post is the largest African-American weekly newspaper in northern California, published in Oakland, California by the Post News Group, and serving mainly Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond and San Francisco. In late 2004 Bailey became one of the producers, co-founders and hosts for OUR-TV (Opportunities in Urban Renaissance Television) on Comcast Channel 78. Bailey had been known for his aggressive questioning of city officials. Oakland Police spokesman Ronald Holmgren said: \\"I know him as being a somewhat outspoken type individual, assertive in his journalistic approach when trying to get at matters at hand.\\" Murder Bailey had written several articles about the problems of Your Black Muslim Bakery. Saleem Bey, half-brother of Antar and Yusuf IV, had anonymously told Bailey believed both Antar and Bey IV had looted the business. By this time, the business was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was over one million dollars in debt. Bailey was shot and killed while working on a story about the finances of Your Black Muslim Bakery, involving its pending bankruptcy. The article was never published. As Bailey walked to work on the morning of August 2, 2007, a van pulled up and a man jumped out and shot the reporter. According to a witness the man had a \\"long gun\\" and ran \\"full tilt\\" across the street. Oakland Fire Capt. Melinda Drayton said Bailey had been shot first in the back and then once in the head. The killer was later identified as Devaughndre Broussard. He confessed to the murder, but after almost two years of incarceration, he agreed to testify against Bey IV in exchange for a 25-year sentence. He told authorities that Bey IV had a hit list of people \\"he wanted to get rid of\\" who had \\"done stuff to\\" the bakery and that Chauncey Bailey's name was on the list. Broussard was booked on suspicion of murder on August 4, 2007, for the killing of Bailey, having told police detectives that he considered himself \\"a good soldier\\". Though other charges were made against those arrested, none of them were charged with Bailey's murder. On August 7, 2007 Broussard was arraigned in Alameda County Superior Court, on charges of murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Broussard testified for the prosecution at the trial of Bey IV and Antoine Mackey in 2011. He stated in court he was ordered by Bey to find, track and kill Bailey before the journalist could print his latest article on the bakery. Bey IV and Mackey were both convicted of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The Chauncey Bailey Project To continue Bailey's work and answer questions regarding his death, more than two dozen reporters, photographers and editors from print, broadcast and electronic media, as well as journalism students, formed a group called the Chauncey Bailey Project. It was convened by New America Media, the Pacific News Service and the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. In June 2008, the Chauncey Bailey Project released a secretly recorded police video that reveals how Black Muslim Bakery leader Yusuf Bey IV kept the gun used in the Chauncey Bailey killing in his closet after the attack and bragged of playing dumb when investigators asked him about the shooting. Bey goes on to describe Bailey's shooting in detail, then laughingly denies he was there, and boasts that his friendship with the case's lead detective protected him from charges. Bey also claims he knew he was being recorded. The Chauncey Bailey Project is not without its critics. Bay Area activist, investigative journalist, and radio talk show host J.R. Valrey (who works under the pseudonym \\"Minister of Information JR\\"), has accused the Chauncey Bailey Project of inaccurate and \\"self-congratulatory\\" reporting. Valrey's criticisms largely stem from a 2008 Chauncey Bailey Project article published in the Oakland Tribune entitled \\"Evidence Ignored\\", of which Valrey's connections to Chauncey Bailey and Your Black Muslim Bakery was one of the focuses. In 2010, Thomas Peele, Josh Richman, Mary Fricker and Bob Butler received the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage from the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication for their work on the project.

The film stars an ensemble cast, featuring Michael Ealy, Jerry Ferrara, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, Kevin Hart, Terrence J, Taraji P. Henson, Romany Malco, and Gabrielle Union. The film was released on April 20, 2012 by Screen Gems.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"In Think Like a Man, an otherwise standard rom-com is partially elevated by a committed -- and attractive -- cast, resulting in a funny take on modern romance.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that a major problem with the film is that it takes seriously the advice given in the book it is based upon, commenting that such an approach \\"might have worked as a screwball comedy or a satire, but can you believe for a moment in characters naive enough to actually live their lives following Steve Harvey's advice? The result is a tiresome exercise that circles at great length through various prefabricated stories defined by the advice each couple needs (or doesn't need).\\" Ebert called the cast \\"superb\\" noting in particular the performances of Meagan Good and Kevin Hart. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly also complimented Good and Hart's performance, as well as Romany Malco's performance. He ultimately gave the film a \\"B-\\" grade, writing that it is \\"so busy tracking courtship as if it were a science project that the bite-size love stories lack spontaneity.\\" In a positive review, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune commended the film for \\"stick[ing] to a formula without falling prey to it\\" and commented that \\"its hangout factor is considerable, because the actors' charms are considerable.\\" =Box office= Think Like a Man grossed over $33.7 million during its opening weekend, an accomplishment which ended The Hunger Games four-week run at the #1 spot at the U.S. box office. The film remained on atop the competition during its second week, bringing in $17.6 million. As of June 24, 2012, Think Like a Man has earned $91,547,205 in both the United States and Canada, along with $4,523,302 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $96,070,507 on a production budget of $12.5 million.

In 1582, Ulu√ß Ali attempted to raid Acireale. Although the raid was unsuccessful, the population were afraid of further attacks and began fortifying the area. The Spanish (then the rulers of the Kingdom of Sicily) built the Fortezza del Tocco between 1592 and 1616. The fort was designed by Camillo Camilliani and Vincenzo Geremia. Other nearby fortifications that were also built around the same time as the Fortezza del Tocco include the Torre Alessandrano, the Torre di Sant'Anna and the Garitta di S. Tecla. Some modifications were made to the fort in the early 17th century. It repelled a French attack in 1675. The fort lost its importance and was decommissioned in the 19th century. Its last guns were removed in 1834, and were taken to the Pinacoteca Zelantea de Acireale, where they remain today. Since 1999, the fort and the surrounding area have been a nature reserve.

History  In 1921 Charles Arrant founded The Standard Advertiser in Durham, North Carolina. The publication served as the only newspaper for the city's black residents. Arrant was killed in 1922. In 1927 Louis Austin, The Standard Advertisers sports editor, acquired a loan from Mechanics and Farmers Bank and purchased the paper. Under Austin's ownership and editorship, the publication's name was changed to The Carolina Times. The paper devoted a significant amount of its news coverage to accounts of racial discrimination. Austin frequently used his editorials to advocate for racial equality. The Carolina Times served as the campaign headquarters for the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs (DCNA), which was later renamed the Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People.Oral History Interview with H. M. Michaux, November 20, 1974. Interview A-0135. Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) in the Southern Oral History Program Collection, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One notable success that Louis E. Austin had in his fight for equality (of many) was the arrest and conviction of a police officer who assaulted an African- American man. The officer would have not been reprimanded for his actions without the vocal support of The Carolina Times, as well as the efforts of the DCNA. The paper's primary sources of revenue were advertising sales and circulation. Austin's progressive stance and use of the paper for advocacy sometimes angered wealthy blacks in Durham, who in return refused to sell him advertisements or grant him loans. On several occasions black banks such as Mechanics and Farmers Bank, feeling that The Carolina Times was a critical resource for the black community, granted Austin loans to continue running the paper. Austin struggled to fund the publication into the early 1950s. Austin died in 1971, and his daughter, Vivian Edmonds, subsequently assumed control of the paper. On January 14, 1979, the building that housed The Carolina Times was burned to the ground; little survived the blaze, and their entire back stock of papers was destroyed. The authorities suspected that it was arson. Edmonds continued the paper's publication, and had a new issue out that Thursday.N N P A. \\"Carolina Times Razed: Arson seen.\\" New York Amsterdam News: A4. 1979.Burke, Gerard. \\"Arson blamed for fire that razed Carolina Times.\\" Baltimore Afro-American: 17.

History The Call and Post was established around 1928 by a group of people including local African-American inventor Garrett A. Morgan, as a merger between the Cleveland Call and the Cleveland Post, two newspapers which had been serving the African American community since 1916 and 1920 respectively. William Otis \\"W.O.\\" Walker, a black Republican who had been co-founder of the Washington Tribune, became editor in 1932. The Call and Post provided extensive coverage of the social and religious life in the African-American community, and was known to feature sensational coverage of violence on its front page. The publication also extensively covered Larry Doby, the first black player to successfully integrate into the American League's Cleveland Indians baseball franchise. Reporter Cleveland Jackson communicated extensively with Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck before Doby was signed by the Indians in 1947. With the influence of editor and publisher William O. Walker from 1932 until his death in 1981, the Call and Post established itself as the most influential voice for African- Americans in Cleveland and ultimately all Ohio. It earned praise as one of the finest African-American newspapers in the country. As early as 1934, the Call and Post was active in calling for public involvement in the Scottsboro case. In 1952, a former Call and Post reporter, Simeon Booker, became the first African-American reporter at The Washington Post.Wil Haygood, \\"The Man From Jet:Simeon Booker not only covered a tumultuous era, he lived it\\", The Washington Post, July 15, 2007. After moving to new offices in 1959, the Call and Post began to publish with offset printing. It was one of the first newspapers in Ohio to use the new technique. Another example of advocacy took place in 1982, with a scathing editorial in support of Cleveland real estate developer Winston E. Willis, whose properties, located near University Circle, had been targeted by the Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, and University Hospitals for expansion.Call and Post Editorial, Fire Inspections as Weapons, January 23, 1982, Pg.

Currently owned by Real Times Inc., it publishes daily online. It was \\"one of the earliest and most influential black newspapers.\\" History =Establishment= It was founded as the weekly Atlanta World on August 5, 1928, by William Alexander Scott II who was only 26 at the time. Scott was a Morehouse graduate who later worked as the only black clerk on the Jacksonville to Washington, D.C., rail line, then in 1927 published a Jacksonville business directory to help blacks find each other. A year later he published a similar directory for Atlanta.\\"Recap: Alexis Scott Shares Atlanta Daily World History on Family Business Radio\\", Family Business Radio, January 12, 2012 At the time, there was very little coverage of black educational institutions, businesses, prominent persons, churches, or other news of significance; the exceptions being crime news and death listings. This was despite the fact that Atlanta contained at the time the most prominent black educational institutions and persons of influence in the country. Whites lived to a large extent sealed off from black Atlanta and only interacted with blacks in service positions, virtually unaware of the black institutions and achievements taking place only a mile or two from their homes. The paper became a semi-weekly in May 1930, and a triweekly in April 1931. In 1931, Scott also began publishing the Chattanooga Tribune and Memphis World, and by doing so, founded the first chain of black newspapers, a chain that would eventually grow, at its peak, to fifty publications. =Daily publication= In 1932 Scott's Atlanta World became a daily and added \\"Daily\\" to its title, becoming the first black daily in the U.S. in the 20th century and the first successful one in all U.S. history. At the time of its founding, the only other black paper in the area was the Atlanta Independent, which ceased publication in 1933. This left the Daily World as the only black paper in town. Its offices were on Auburn Avenue (\\"Sweet Auburn\\") celebrated as the home of the black business, social, and religious community and famously called by John Wesley Dobbs the \\"richest Negro street in the world\\". On February 4, 1934, Scott was shot and killed; no one was ever convicted of the crime. His brother, Cornelius Adolphus (C.A.) Scott, took over as head of the paper, which subsequently adopted a more conservative, Republican position, reflecting Cornelius' own political views and his resentment over the Democrats' historical support of segregation and bias against African- Americans. =Civil Rights Movement= During the Civil Rights Movement, the Daily World was criticized for not supporting sit-ins staged at several white- owned restaurants in downtown Atlanta. Advertisers threatened to pull their business if the demonstrations didn‚Äôt stop. C.A. Scott thought the demonstrations were dangerous, would work against the participants when they later would be looking for jobs, and reasoned that blacks would more effectively improve their situation by working towards ending segregation in education, obtaining political and voting influence, and improving their economic situations. Editorial content during this period was mainly neutral in tone, as opposed to actively promoting Negro rights or attacking racism, and as such white businesses did not feel threatened by its content, allowing the Daily World to secure advertising support from companies such as Coca- Cola, Sears, Roebuck and Rich's, the largest department store in the city. The paper did urge blacks to shop at black-owned businesses (the \\"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\\" campaign). In the 1940s it sponsored voter registration efforts. The paper also covered the Atlanta black community's social, church, and sports news. The Daily World covered, on a national basis, topics including: * Lynchings * Police brutality * Capital punishment * the trials of the Scottsboro Boys, nine black Alabama teenagers accused of rape * Racial discrimination in the federal government * the white primary system in Georgia (abolished 1946) * School segregation * Racial discrimination against African- Americans in the U.S. Military during World War II. =21st century= Cornelius Scott retired in 1997 and his great niece, Alexis Scott Reeves, took over as publisher. Reeves has previously been a journalist at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta's leading daily, and later vice-president of community affairs there. During the 1980s and 1990s, the newspaper's circulation declined from its peak over 20,000 in the 1960s to a steady 10,000. By 2000, although it retained the word \\"Daily\\" in its name, it had cut back its publication schedule to only two editions per week, on Sundays and Thursdays. In 2012, the Atlanta Daily World joined Real Times Inc., a publisher of five other African-American weeklies, including the Chicago Defender and New Pittsburgh Courier. Alexis Scott said the sale would give the World more multimedia resources, calling it \\"truly a new beginning for the paper.\\" Historic offices In 2008 the Downtown Atlanta tornado damaged the World's offices at 145 Auburn Avenue. The paper's operations subsequently moved to another location.Scott Henry, \\"Atlanta Daily World building is latest Auburn Avenue historical site at risk\\", Creative Loafing In 2012 Scott announced plans to sell the building where this important part of Atlanta's black history took place; the buyer had plans to demolish the building. This caused outcry in the local Old Fourth Ward neighborhood at the loss of yet another historic building on Auburn Avenue. The Historic District Development Corporation, whose mission is historic preservation in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic District launched an online petition to save the building. Owner and publisher Alexis Scott responded in a joint statement with developer Integral Group claiming that demolition of the building but saving the fa√ßade was the only feasible option to preserve any portion of the historic structure and thus preserve the history in some physical form. On January 8, 2014 the offices were sold to commercial real estate developer and Sidewalk Radio host Gene Kansas who stated that he planned to restore the building for retail and residential use, and that it would be designed by Gamble and Gamble architects, the same firm redesigning the Clermont Motor Inn on Ponce de Leon Avenue in Poncey-Highland into a boutique hotel.Christopher Seward, \\"Atlanta Daily World building sold; retail, housing planned\\", '\\"Atlanta Journal- Constitution, January 8, 2014 Firsts * First black daily in the 20th century; first successful black daily ever * First black newspaper with assigned White House correspondent: Harry S.

It was founded in 1905 by Robert S. Abbott and was once considered the \\"most important\\" newspaper of its kind. Abbott's newspaper reported and campaigned against Jim Crow era violence and urged black people in the American South to come north in what became the Great Migration. Abbott worked out an informal distribution system with Pullman porters who surreptitiously (and sometimes against southern state laws and mores) took his paper by rail far beyond Chicago, especially to African American readers in the Southern United States. Under his nephew and chosen successor, John H. Sengstacke, the paper took on segregation, especially in the U.S. military, during World War II. Copies of the paper were passed along in communities, and it is estimated that at its most successful, each copy made its way into the hands of four to five African-Americans. In 1919‚Äì1922, the Defender attracted the writing talents of Langston Hughes; from the 1940s through 1960s Hughes also wrote an opinion column for the paper. Washington D.C and international correspondent Ethel Payne, poet Gwendolyn Brooks, author Willard Motley, journalists Ida B. Wells and Louis Lomax wrote for the paper at different times. During the height of the civil rights movement era, it was published as The Chicago Daily Defender, a daily newspaper, beginning in 1956. It returned to a weekly paper in 2008. In 2019, its publisher, Real Times Media Inc., announced that the Defender would cease its print edition but continue as an online publication. The editorial board of the Chicago Tribune, noting the impact The Defender has had in its 114 years, praised the continuation of the publication in its new form. Foundation and social impact, role in the Great Migration The Chicago Defender's editor and founder Robert Sengstacke Abbott played a major role in influencing the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North by means of strong, moralistic rhetoric in his editorials and political cartoons, the promotion of Chicago as a destination, and the advertisement of successful black individuals as inspiration for blacks in the South. The rhetoric and art exhibited in the Defender demanded equality of the races and promoted a northern migration. Abbott published articles that were expos√©s of southern crimes against blacks. The Defender consistently published articles describing lynchings in the South, with vivid descriptions of gore and the victims' deaths. Lynchings were at a peak at the turn of the century, in the period when southern state legislatures passed new constitutions and laws to disenfranchise most blacks and exclude them from the political system. Legislatures dominated by conservative white Democrats established racial segregation and Jim Crow. Abbott openly blamed the lynching violence on the white mobs who were typically involved, forcing readers to accept that these crimes were \\"systematic and unremitting\\". The newspaper's intense focus on these injustices implicitly laid the groundwork upon which Abbott would build his explicit critiques of society. At the same time, the NAACP was publicizing the toll of lynching at its offices in New York City. The art in the Defender, particularly its political cartoons, explicitly addressed race issues and advocated northern migration of blacks. After the movement of southern blacks northward became a quantifiable phenomenon, the Defender took a particular interest in sensationalizing migratory stories, often on the front page. Abbott positioned his paper as a primary influence of these movements before historians would, for he used the Defender to initiate and advertise a \\"Great Northern Drive\\" day, set for May 15, 1917. The movement to northern and midwestern cities, and to the West Coast at the time of World War I, became known as the Great Migration, in which 1.5 million blacks moved out of the rural South in early 20th century years up to 1940, and another 5 million left towns and rural areas from 1940 to 1970. Abbott used the Defender to promote Chicago as an attractive destination for southern blacks. Abbott presented Chicago as a promised-land with abundant jobs, as he included advertisements \\"clearly aimed at southerners,\\" that called for massive numbers of workers wanted in factory positions. The Defender was filled with advertisements for desirable commodities, beauty products and technological devices. Abbott's paper was the first black newspaper to incorporate a full entertainment section. Chicago was portrayed as a lively city where blacks commonly went to the theaters, ate out at fancy restaurants, attended sports events, including \\"cheering for the American Black Giants, black America's favorite baseball team\\", and could dance all night in the hottest night clubs. The Defender featured letters and poetry submitted by successful recent migrants; these writings \\"served as representative anecdotes, supplying readers with prototype examples... that characterized the migration campaign\\". To supplement these first-person accounts, Abbott often published small features on successful blacks in Chicago. The well-known African American mentalist Princess Mysteria had from 1920 to her death in 1930 a weekly column on the Defender, called \\"Advise to the Wise and Otherwise.\\" John Sengstacke (pictured 1942) took over for the Defender's founder, his uncle, Robert Abbott In 1923, Abbott and editor Lucius Harper created the Bud Billiken Club for black children through the \\"Junior Defender\\" page of the paper. The club encouraged the children's proper development, and reading The Defender. In 1929 the organization began the Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic, which is still held annually in Chicago in early August. In the 1950s, under Sengstacke's direction, the Bud Billiken Parade expanded and emerged as the largest single event in Chicago. Today, it attracts more than one million attendance with more than 25 million television viewers, making it one of the largest parades in the country. In 1928, for the first time, The Defender refused to endorse a Republican Party presidential candidate. Throughout the election it ran a series of articles critical of the party, its failures to advance black civil rights, and what it saw as Republican's embrace or acquiescence in segregationism, party support in a revitalized Ku Klux Klan, and the Republican's Lily White Movement. The paper's final pre-election editorial read in part: ‚ÄúWe want justice in America and we mean to get it. If 50 years of support to the Republican Party doesn‚Äôt get us justice, then we must of necessity shift our allegiance to new quarters.‚Äù For a variety of reasons, in the coming years, black support for the Republican Party fell rapidly. Sengstacke era Abbott took a special interest in his nephew, John H. Sengstacke (1912‚Äì1997), paying for his education and grooming him to take over the Defender, which he did in 1940 after working with his uncle for several years. He urged integration of the armed forces. In 1948, he was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to the commission to study this and plan the process, which was initiated by the military in 1949. Sengstacke also brought together for the first time major black newspaper publishers and created the National Negro Publishers Association, later renamed the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA). In the early 21st century, the NNPA consists of more than 200 member black newspapers. Two days following the publishers' first meeting in Chicago, Abbott died. One of Sengstacke's most striking accomplishments occurred on February 6, 1956, when the Defender became a daily newspaper and changed its name to the Chicago Daily Defender, the nation's second black daily newspaper. It immediately became the largest black-owned daily in the nation. It published as a daily until 2003, when new owners converted the Defender back to a weekly. The Defender was one of only three African-American dailies in the United States; the other two are the Atlanta Daily World, the first black newspaper founded as a daily in 1928, and the New York Daily Challenge,New York Daily Challenge, Manta founded in 1971. In 1965 Sengstacke created a chain of newspapers, which also included the Pittsburgh Courier, the Memphis Tri-State Defender, and the Michigan Chronicle. In a 1967 editorial, the Defender decried anti-Semitism in the community, reminding readers of the role of Jews in the civil rights movement. \\"These powerful voices,\\" the Defender wrote, \\"which have been lifted on behalf of the Negro peoples' cause, should not be forgotten when resolutions are passed by the black power hierarchy. Jews and Negroes have problems in common. They can ill-afford to be at one another's throats.\\"  Real Times Inc.  Control of the Chicago Defender and her sister publications was transferred to a new ownership group named Real Times Inc. in January 2003. Real Times, Inc. was organized and led by Thom Picou, and Robert (Bobby) Sengstacke, John H. Sengstacke's surviving child and father of the beneficiaries of the Sengstacke Trust. In effect, Picou, then chairman and CEO of Real Times, Inc., led what was then labeled a \\"Sengstacke family-led\\" deal to facilitate trust beneficiaries and other Sengstacke family shareholders to agree to the sale of the company. Picou recruited Sam Logan, former publisher of the Michigan Chronicle, who then recruited O'Neil Swanson, Bill Pickard, Ron Hall and Gordon Follmer, black businessman from Detroit, Michigan (the \\"Detroit Group\\"), as investors in Real Times. Chicago investors included Picou, Bobby Sengstacke, David M. Milliner (who served as publisher of the Chicago Defender from 2003 to 2004), Kurt Cherry and James Carr. In July 2019, the Chicago Defender reported that recent print runs had numbered 16,000 but that its digital edition reached almost half a million unique monthly visitors.

A specialist sprinter, he won ten of his forty-nine races in a track career which lasted from May 1993 until September 1998. In his first three seasons he showed consistent form, winning the City Walls Stakes in 1994 Achilles Stakes in the following year. He appeared to lose his form as a five- year-old and was sold cheaply at auction at the end of the season. After entering the stable of David Nicholls in 1997 he improved into a top class performer, winning the Epsom Dash and the Sprint Stakes before recording his biggest success when dead-heating for the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes. His victory in the Nunthorpe made Alex Greaves the first woman to ride a Group One winner in Europe. The gelding failed to win at seven and died the following spring after complications arising from colic surgery. Background Ya Malak was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by Bobby and Helen Kennard. He was sired by Fairy King, an American-bred stallion who was retired after sustaining an injury after a single racecourse appearance in Ireland. He became a very successful breeding stallion, siring major winners including Turtle Island, Helissio, Oath and Falbrav. Ya Malak's dam La Tuerta was a useful sprint handicapper who won three races from eleven starts and earned a Timeform rating of 96 in 1995. She was a daughter of Smarten Up who won dead- heated for the Temple Stakes in 1978 who also produced the outstanding sprinter Cadeaux Genereux. As a yearling the colt was sent to the Tattersalls sales in September 1992 and was bought for 73,000 guineas by the British Bloodstock Agency. The horse entered the ownership of G Jabre and was sent into training with John \\"Pip\\" Payne at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1993: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1993, Ya Malak was ridden in all six of his starts by Ray Cochrane. He made his debut by finishing third in a maiden race over five furlongs at Windsor Racecourse on 10 May and recorded his first success in a similar event at Ripon Racecourse two weeks later. He was then moved up in class and was beaten in his next three races: he finished fifth in the Norfolk Stakes, second in the Dragon Stakes and fourth in the Flying Childers Stakes. On his final appearance of the year in a minor event at Warwick Racecourse in October. Starting the 4/7 favourite he led from the start and won by one and a half lengths from Moscow Road. =1994: three-year-old season= As a three-year-old, Ya Malak began his season in minor events, finishing second at Haydock Park in April and then winning at Beverley Racecourse in May. In June he finished unplaced in the Epsom Dash, and second at Sandown Park before winning at Nottingham Racecourse. On 9 July he started 2/1 favourite for the City Walls Stakes over five furlongs at Chester Racecourse. Ridden as in his previous start by Alan Munro he took the lead at half way and won by one and a half lengths from Lucky Parkes. Later that month he was moved up in class for the King George Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and finished unplaced behind Lochsong before being sent to France where he finished second in the Listed Prix du Cercle at Deauville. A drop in class in autumn saw no improvement as he finished fifth in minor events at Newbury and Newcastle. =1995: four-year-old season= In 1995 Ya Malak finished third at Thirsk and second at Beverley before starting a 16/1 outsider for the Listed Achilles Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse on 3 June. Ridden by the Australian jockey Brent Thomson, who became his regular partner, he tracked the front-running favourite Eveningperformance before overtaking the filly a furlong out and winning by two lengths. He was beaten in his next three starts, finishing second in the Prix Hampton at √âvry, sixth in the City Walls Stakes and fourth in the Prix du Cercle. Despite his moderate form, the horse was stepped up to Group One level for the first time in August when he started a 20/1 outsider for the Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse. He produced by far his best effort up to that time, tracking the leaders before staying on in the closing stages to finish second to the Godolphin runner So Factual. On his only subsequent appearance that year he finished sixth to Eveningperformance in the Scarbrough Stakes at Doncaster. =1996: five-year-old season= Ya Malak made no impact in 1996, failing to win in nine races. The nearest he came to success was when he finished third to Lucky Parkes in the City Wall Stakes, whilst his only venture into top class saw him finish last of the seventeen runners in the King's Stand Stakes. In the autumn he was removed from Payne and sent to be trained at Ian Balding's stable at Kingsclere for his last two starts, but there was no sign of improvement. In October, the gelding was sent to the Doncaster sales and was bought for 23,000 guineas by the trainer David Nicholls. Nicholls later admitted that the purchase left him ¬£1500 overdrawn but commented \\"it wasn't a silly thing to do, if you believe in what you are doing\\". =1997: six-year- old season= For the 1997 season, Ya Malak was trained by Nicholls in Yorkshire and ridden all his races by Alex Greaves, Britain's leading female jockey and Nicholls' wife. Nicholls rode the horse in some of his training gallops and described the horse as the fastest he had ever ridden. On his first appearance for his new connections, the gelding finished fifth of six behind Bolshoi in the East Riding Stakes at Beverley in April, tiring in the closing stages after leading a furlong out. On 20 May at the same track he recorded his first win for almost two years in the Angel Stakes. He was restrained by Greaves in the early stages before taking the lead a furlong out and winning by two lengths from the favoured Tadeo. Six days later he was stepped up in class for the Temple Stakes at Sandown and started a 25/1 outsider. He dropped to the rear of the field two furlongs out after being denied a clear run but finished strongly and finished fifth, just over a length behind the winner Croft Pool. The Dash at Epsom on 7 June saw Ya Malak assigned top weight of 128 pounds against eleven opponents headed by the Michael Jarvis-trained mare Blue Iris. The gelding was always among the leaders, went to the front a furlong out and accelerated away from his opponents to win easily by five lengths. At Royal Ascot thirteen days he started third favourite behind Almaty and Titus Livius in his second attempt to win the King's Stand Stakes. After taking the lead two furlongs out he faded in the closing stages and finished tenth behind the French outsider Don't Worry Me. Ya Malak continued his busy schedule with three races in July. At Sandown on the fifth of the month he faced his old rivals Eveningperformance and Bolshoi in the Sprint Stakes and started third favourite behind Struggler (Prix de Saint-Georges)and To The Roof (1996 Epsom Dash). After being denied a clear run a quarter mile from the finish he recovered to take the lead in the final strides and won by a neck from Struggler. Five days later he reappeared at Chester and finished fourth to Tedburrow in the City Wall Stakes under top weight of 134 pounds. At the end of the month he ran poorly when unplaced behind Averti in the King George Stakes at Goodwood. Nicholls explained the performance by reporting that the gelding had displaying symptoms of horse colic soon after the race. On 21 August at York, Ya Malak was one of fifteen sprinters to contest the Nunthorpe Stakes and started at odds of 11/1. The July Cup winner Compton Place started favourite ahead of Coastal Bluff, the winner of the Stewards' Cup and the Ayr Gold Cup in 1996. The other runners were Mind Games (Temple Stakes), Indian Rocket (Mill Reef Stakes), Almaty, Averti, Don't Worry Me, Easycall (Flying Childers Stakes), Struggler, Eveningperformance, Bolshoi, Hever Golf Rose, Croft Pool and Cyrano's Lad. Greaves restrained the gelding in the early stages as Eveningperformance set the pace from Coastal Bluff and Mind Games before beginning to make progress at half way. Mind Games went to the front a quarter mile out before Coastal Bluff took the lead entering the final furlong. Ya Malak stayed on strongly in the closing stages and crossed the line level with Coastal Bluff, just ahead of the fast-finishing Averti with the 50/1 outsider Cyrano's Lad taking fourth. After examining the photo finish the racecourse judge declared a dead heat between Ya Malak and Coastal Bluff. Greaves became the first female jockey to win a Group One race in Europe. After the race Greaves commented \\"Today I think I've shown that if the animal is good enough then so am I\\" whilst Nicholls said \\"Ya Malak showed what a good horse he is today and the jockey did the same. I don't have to tell anyone how good she is any more. Everyone in England, Ireland and France can see how capable she is. She's philosophical and realises there are owners and trainers who will never put her up, but that's their problem.\\" =Later career and death= The horse remained in training but failed to reproduce his 1997 form. He finished unplaced in his first four races before finishing third in a minor stakes race at Newmarket in July. After finishing fifth at Leicester he ended his racing career by finishing sixth behind Almaty at Beverley on 22 September. Ya Malak was scheduled to return to racing in 1999 and was reported by Nicholls to be \\"showing his old sparkle\\" before developing a severe case of colic in March. He underwent surgery at the Minster Veterinary Surgery in York but contracted peritonitis and died shortly afterwards.

The owners and editors were Daisy Bates and L. C. Bates and their newspaper is \\"believed by many to be instrumental in bringing about the desegregation of the Little Rock public schools.\\" Goals After their move to Little Rock, the Bateses decided to act on a dream of theirs, the ownership of a newspaper. They leased a printing plant that belonged to a church publication, taking over the Twin City Press, and inaugurated their weekly statewide newspaper on May 9, 1941. The State Press was primarily concerned with advocacy journalism and was modeled off other African-American publications of the era, such as the Chicago Defender and The Crisis. As C. Calvin Smith noted, \\"the crusading fervor of State Press editorials was clearly demonstrated\\" by the second issue. Stories about civil rights often ran on the front page with the rest of the paper mainly filled with other stories that spotlighted achievements of black Arkansans. Pictures were also in abundance throughout the paper. L. C. Bates's editorials were firey, writing that a pastor's sermons were \\"more offensive than the odor from a cesspool that has been exposed to the sun from the morning of creation down to the present moment\\" and leading to a $1,500 judgement for libel. The paper became an avid voice for civil rights even before a nationally recognized movement had emerged. It covered local and nationwide civil rights news, such as the Emmett Till lynching, which it ran as the lead story, headlined \\"NAACP Head Says Lynching of Schoolboy Laid[sic] to White Supremacy Drive in Miss.\\" The horrific fire at the Arkansas Negro Boys' Industrial School yielded an image so painful that L. C. Bates destroyed both the print and negative. Daisy Bates was later recognized as co-publisher of the paper. Role in school segregation battle As the former president of the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP, Daisy Bates was involved deeply in desegregated events. Even though in 1954 the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education made all the segregated schools illegal, the schools in Arkansas refused to enroll African American students. The Bateses editorialized, \\"We feel that the proper approach would be for the leaders among the Negro race‚Äînot clabber mouths, Uncle Toms, or grinning appeasers to get together and counsel with the school heads.\\" Concerning the policy of academic desegregation, The State press cultivated a spirit of immediatism within the hearts of African American and white citizens. Opposite to gradual approach, this newspaper mainly wanted immediate reform in Arkansas' educational system. The State Press reported that the NAACP was the lead organizer in these protest events, and the newspaper also tended to enlarge national influence to let more people get involved in the educational events in Little Rock. While Governor Orval Faubus and his supporters were refusing even token desegregation of Central High School, this editorial appeared on the front page: > It is the belief of this paper that since the Negro's loyalty to America has > forced him to shed blood on foreign battle fields against enemies, to > safeguard constitutional rights, he is in no mood to sacrifice these rights > for peace and harmony at home. Throughout its existence, the State Press covered all social news happening within the state. It was an avid supporter of racial integration in schools and thoroughly publicized its support in its pages. In 1957, Daisy Bates was visited by an unnamed white woman who threatened that unless Bates withdrew her support for integration, \\"you'll be destroyed ‚Äî you, your newspaper, your reputation. Everything!\\". Because of its position during the Little Rock segregation fight, white advertisers, including Southwestern Bell, Arkansas Louisiana Gas, Arkansas Power and Light (now Entergy) held another boycott to punish the newspaper for supporting desegregation.176 This boycott successfully cut off funding, except the money which came directly and through advertisements from the NAACP national office, and through ads from supporters throughout the country. Despite this the State Press was unable to maintain itself and the last issue was published on October 29, 1959. Relaunch Upon her husband's death, Daisy Bates relaunched the State Press in 1984, selling to Janis F. Kearney in 1987, who published it for five more years.

She acquired The Grove from her father in 1851 and held it until 1903. She received distinction after the Civil War for her efforts in historic preservation, history, memorialization, forestry, silkworm cultivation, and the promotion of Florida. She was the author of Florida Breezes, a semi-fictional account of antebellum life primarily set in Middle Florida which is widely regarded as one of the best primary source accounts of the planter class lifestyle in Florida. She was the founder of the Florida chapters of the Mount Vernon Ladies Association and the Ladies Hermitage Association. She was also named a Florida delegate to several important expositions, including the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia (1876), the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893), and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, France (1889). She was the founder of the Ladies Memorial Association of Tallahassee, a group that is now known as the Anna Jackson Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Her published report made before the American Forestry Congress in 1888 titled ‚ÄúNotes of Some of the Forest Features of Florida‚Äù, is considered a seminal work in the field of fire ecology. She was also a tireless promoter of silk culture in Florida, representing the Ladies Silk Culture Association of Philadelphia and emerging as a local expert in cultivation. Early life Ellen Call Long was born on The Grove property in Tallahassee on September 9, 1825, the first child of Richard Keith Call and Mary Letitia Kirkman. Of the 8 children born to the Calls, only their oldest and youngest daughters lived to adulthood. According to popular legend, Ellen was the first white child born in the city, a story she openly advertised later in her life. After spending early life in Tallahassee, her parents sent her north to boarding schools in Baltimore and later Philadelphia. She was especially close to her mother, and her mother's death in 1836 had a profound impact on the rest of Ellen Call Long's life. Concerned over the precarious situation of his family, Richard Keith Call sent his two surviving daughters to Nashville, Tennessee, to live with his mother- in-law. Ellen spent the rest of her childhood between Nashville and several northern boarding schools. Despite this separation, she and her father grew to be especially close, and she remained fiercely loyal to her father for the rest of her life.Jane Aurell Menton, The Grove: A Florida Home Through Seven Generations (Tallahassee, FL: Sentry Press, 1998), 21-24. Return to Tallahassee Ellen Call Long and Unknown Woman in Front of Grove, ca. 1880In 1843, Ellen Call Long returned to Tallahassee to live on a permanent basis. By this time, her father was in his second term as governor. Ellen quickly established herself within the elite social circles of the city, acting as hostess for her father. In 1844, she married Medicus A. Long, a promising young lawyer from Tennessee who later served multiple terms in the Florida State Legislature. Like her parents before her, only Ellen's oldest and youngest children Richard Call Long and Eleanora Long Hollinger survived to adulthood. After a failed run for governor in 1845, her father began committing himself more to his plantation at Orchard Pond. In 1851, he formally deeded The Grove to Ellen, who had already established her family there. Ellen later inherited Orchard Pond and her father's slaves as well, which served as her main means of support through the end of the Civil War.Menton, 29-32. During the 1850s, her father emerged as one of the leading voices of Southern Unionism in the state. After the demise of the Whig Party, Call was active in several pro-unionist parties, including the American Party and the Constitutional Union Party. Ever loyal to her father, she was a staunch Unionist as well, which put her at odds with her husband, who was an outspoken secessionist. Medicus Long even openly debated his father-in-law on the subject of secession in public. Long eventually relocated to Texas shortly before the Civil War ostensibly for health reasons but they remained separated for the rest of their lives although they remained officially married.Menton, 32-33. Although she vehemently opposed secession, Ellen Call Long still supported the Confederate cause, opening her home to wounded soldiers and hosting Confederate officers. Her son Richard Long enlisted in the 2nd Florida Cavalry. Her enthusiasm for the cause was guarded, however, as she refused to invest in Confederate bonds and remained bitterly opposed to secessionists, which became more pronounced as the war progressed. Tallahassee remained the only southern capital to not fall into Union hands during the war, and as a result the people of the city were spared much of the destruction that befell cities such as Richmond, Atlanta, and Charleston. With the surrender of General Joseph Johnston, the Confederate forces in Florida were ordered to disband. Ellen Call Long witnessed the entry of General McCook into Tallahassee in May 1865. Despite her strong Unionism, she was embittered by the humiliation faced by the South at defeat.Ellen Call Long diary, May 10, [1865], https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/180853?id=36; Ellen Call Long diary, May 21, [1865], https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/180853?id=40. Reconstruction Era Although the end of the Civil War and the beginning of Reconstruction brought significant economic hardships to the South, this period marked a remarkable political turnaround for Ellen Call Long's family. In 1865, her cousin David S. Walker was elected governor of Florida and another cousin Wilkinson Call was elected as senator. Ellen continued to rely on income generated by her Orchard Pond property, which now utilized sharecropper labor, many of whom were former slaves of the Call family. After a brief period in Texas, her son and his wife joined her at The Grove, where they resided with their two children. Her widowed daughter and her two sons also moved into the residence later. Historic Preservation Ellen Call Long represented Florida in the founding of two of the most prominent national historic preservation organizations of the era, the Mount Vernon Ladies Association (MVLA) and the Ladies Hermitage Association (LHA). Founded by Ann Pamela Cunningham in 1853 to salvage George Washington's residence Mount Vernon, the MVLA was the first major national historic preservation organization in the United States. Although Catherine Murat was the first Vice Regent for the state of Florida, Ellen Long was the principal organizer and cofounder of the Florida chapter of the MVLA and remained actively involved with the group for several years afterwards. Despite the difficulties faced in communication and travel at the time, Long and Catherine Murat managed to establish a local presence for the MVLA in every town and county in the state and raised several thousand dollars for the cause.Ann Pamela Cunningham letter to RK Call, [undated], in Ellen Call Long, Florida Breezes, or, Florida, New and Old (Jacksonville, FL: Douglas Printing Company, Inc., 1883) [reprint] (Gainesville, FL: University of Florida Press, 1962), 259-260. The success of the MVLA inspired the establishment of similar organizations around the country. In 1889, a group of Tennessee women concerned with the condition of Andrew Jackson's The Hermitage, established the LHA to aid in its restoration. The group named Ellen Call Long as the first vice regent for the state of Florida. For Ellen, whose father was a prot√©g√© of Jackson, the Hermitage held personal as well as national significance. As vice regent, she had a significant role in early fundraising and organizing efforts for the LHA. She also donated several items from The Grove to The Hermitage and actively solicited donations on behalf of the LHA. Due in part to the pioneering efforts of women such as Ellen Call Long, both Mount Vernon and The Hermitage remain open today as public museums.Mary C. Dorris, Preservation of the Hermitage, 1889-1915 (Nashville, TN: The Ladies Hermitage Association, 1915), 62-64. Memorialization After the Civil War, drawing inspiration from other southern cities, the Ladies Memorial Association of Tallahassee was founded in 1866.Semi-Weekly Floridian, July 9, 1866, p. 2 column 4.Florida Breezes, p. 385 According to a history she wrote several years later, Long was offered the leadership to the organization when it formed but declined, citing a planned extended absence and her past as a unionist possibly interfering with the goals of the organization. Initially listed as a \\"foreign agent\\" of the organization, she would eventually take over as its president.Semi-Weekly Floridian, July 9, 1866, p. 2 column 5. It was the first such group founded in Florida and one of the earliest founded in the south. Initially formed to reclaim Confederate burials and commemorate the Confederate dead, the women's memorial associations that formed in the south often held elaborate annual graveside ceremonies. These ceremonies usually involved laying flowers and wreaths on the headstones of Confederate veterans and served as the direct inspiration of what became Decoration Day in the north, now known as Memorial Day. The Ladies Memorial Association of Tallahassee primarily focused on erecting a monument memorializing Florida's Confederate casualties, but it soon expanded its mission to raise money for veterans, engage in public outreach, and petition for state recognition of Confederate Memorial Day. Beginning in 1867,Publications of the Florida Historical Society a year after most other cities in the South established April 26 as memorial day, the women of the Tallahassee Association also adopted April 26 as an annual day of observance for the Confederate veterans in what was later called Confederate Memorial Day, which the state of Florida later recognized.Esther H. Berumen, ‚ÄúCompeting Memories: Tallahassee‚Äôs Civil War Commemorations, Exhibits, and Celebrations‚Äù FSU thesis, 2009, 21-22; Ellen Call Long, A History of the Memorial Association Formed in Tallahassee After the Late Civil War [unpublished] [1905], 1-4; Florida Legislature Legislative Journal, 254-255; Bellware & Gardiner, The Genesis of Memorial Day in America (Columbus State University, 2014). As Ellen Call Long later wrote on the Ladies Memorial Association: ‚ÄúOur purpose is purely religious ‚Äì a labor of love ‚Äì the sacred care of the dead, to reclaim from oblivion and defamation the memory and graves of those who, ‚Äòright or wrong,‚Äô stood by their country's cause... In no invidious spirit do we come; the political storm that shook our country to its foundation... is passed; war with its carnage is over; and we are done with the cause; and though we scarce discover the silver lining of the dark clouds which have so long hung like a pall above us, we believe that it will yet show itself, and are willing to do all that women can do to stem the tide of bitterness, and assuage the angry feelings that naturally, at present, exist between the two sections of the country.‚ÄùLong, Florida Breezes, 386. World‚Äôs Fair Delegate After the Civil War, Ellen Call Long earned a reputation as a tireless promoter of Florida and took the lead in encouraging national reconciliation in the state. She was able to use her family's political connections to secure several appointments to key expositions for herself and her family. Perhaps her most notable contribution was to the Centennial Exposition celebrated in Philadelphia in 1876. She saw this as an opportunity to rekindle old bonds of nationalism that the war destroyed. Her upbringing in the boarding schools of the north, most notably Philadelphia, gave her connections to several prominent families, which she used to her advantage. She received the appointment as Florida's delegate to the exhibition, but despite her best efforts, she was unable to generate much interest in the venture and received a lukewarm response from her fellow Floridians embittered by war and Reconstruction. Her efforts did not go unnoticed, however, as she was widely commended for her tireless work with the exposition. She would later serve as a Florida delegate in the World Cotton Centennial (1884), the Exposition Universelle (1889), the World's Columbian Exposition (1893), and Tennessee Centennial (1897).Menton, The Grove, 38-39. Silkworm Cultivation Faced with maintaining a large extended family and a high standard of living as resources were dwindling, Ellen turned to alternative methods of generating income. She immersed herself in silkworm cultivation, studying for a period in the 1870s with the Women's Silk Culture Association in Philadelphia, which she joined and was an active member. She raised the silkworms and produced the silk on The Grove property itself, first utilizing the first floor of the main house before constructing a small cottage on the property near the cemetery for the purpose. She published a book on silkworm cultivation, titled Silk Farming that was well received. She produced ceremonial silk flags for the 1885 gubernatorial inauguration of Florida governor Edward A. Perry. She also presented a silk flag made from silk grown at The Grove to the Board of Lady Managers at the 1893 Columbian Exposition, which was displayed in the Woman's Building.Menton, The Grove, 39. Forestry Ellen Call Long was an early member of the Southern Forestry Congress, which was founded in DeFuniak Springs, Florida, at the annual Chautauqua winter conference in 1884. It was as a result of this group's efforts that Arbor Day first gained recognition in states throughout the south, including Florida. Long was appointed as Secretary of the group, and was among the delegates present when they joined the American Forestry Congress in 1888. At the meeting of the American Forestry Congress held in Atlanta in 1888, she presented a paper titled ‚ÄúNotes of Some of the Forest Features of Florida,‚Äù which was later published in the Proceedings. Describing fires as absolutely essential for the growth of longleaf pine forests in the south, it was one of the earliest published pieces to advocate for controlled burning at a time when the accepted forestry standards called for total fire suppression. She went on the further draw the connection between the suppression of fire and the development of hardwood hammocks in lands that were once longleaf pine forests. Although the published piece received little attention at the time, it would be widely cited by early advocates of fire ecology such as Roland Harper and Herbert Stoddard as a seminal work in the field.Ellen Call Long, ‚ÄúNotes on Some of the Forest Features of Florida, with Item of Tree Growth in that State,‚Äù Proceedings of the American Forestry Congress (Vol. 7, Issue 1), 38-41; Albert G. Way, Conserving Southern Longleaf: Herbert Stoddard and the Rise of Ecological Land Management (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2011), 246. Historian Long's most notable work as a writer was Florida Breezes, a semi-fictional account set primarily in Antebellum Era Florida told from the perspective of a northern visitor visiting Tallahassee. The book, which never saw widespread publication upon its release in 1883, was unpopular at the time due to its rejection of the morality of slavery and lionization of the southern unionist cause. Her public statements declaring Abraham Lincoln as one of the greatest presidents in American history and open support of a local black postmaster also generated considerable local opposition. Extra copies of the publication were burned. In the years following her death, however, the book was looked upon as a valuable firsthand account of Middle Florida planter life. It was republished by the University of Florida in 1960.Margaret Louise Chapman, Introduction, in Ellen Call Long, Florida Breezes, xvii-xxi. Long was an author of several books and articles pertaining to a variety of subjects. She wrote a history of Florida for the state school system but it was rejected. Her work and research later went to her niece Caroline Mays Brevard, a noted historian and educator who wrote a history of Florida which was used for years as the official textbook for schoolchildren in the state.Caroline Mays Brevard, A History of Florida (New York: American Book Company, 1904), 5-6. By the end of her life, the debts accumulated from maintaining a large property and an expensive lifestyle caught up with Long. She began selling off portions of the lands around The Grove to a holding company. In 1906, the state Governor's Mansion was built on land originally part of The Grove property. In 1903, under threat of foreclosure on her properties, Long turned to her grandson-in-law, Charles E. Hunt. In exchange for being relieved of the debt on the property, Hunt received title to both The Grove and Orchard Pond. Realizing she was losing possession of the properties, Long later sued Hunt, claiming she misunderstood the nature of the arrangement. She was unsuccessful in getting her property back, and upon her death in 1905, the property went over to her granddaughter (Hunt's wife) Reinette Long Hunt.Menton, The Grove, 42-44.

In 1922 she became the first woman in the state to hold elected office when she was elected superintendent of schools of Laurens County. Wofford graduated from Winthrop College in 1916 and taught at Laurens High School shortly thereafter. At the onset of World War I, she joined the United States Navy as a yeoman, one of the first women to enlist in the war effort. Returning to Laurens after the war, she was elected in 1922 as the county superintendent of schools, becoming the first woman in South Carolina to discharge that role as well as the first woman in the state to be elected to public office. She would serve two terms. She also served a term as the first president of the South Carolina State Teachers Association, and worked as a school principal as well as teacher. She continued her education through Columbia University, from which school she received a doctorate, before becoming head professor and director of rural education at the State Teachers College in Buffalo, New York. She also taught education at the University of Florida, and held a degree from Cornell University. Winthrop wrote two books on the subject of education, Modern Education in the Small Rural School and Teaching in Small Schools, for which she gained some recognition; she was also published by the National Education Association during her career, and wrote numerous other works on the subject. She was an avid golfer and collected antiques, and was listed in Who's Who during her career. Wofford is buried in the cemetery of New Prospect Baptist Church in Laurens. A small archive related to her career is held at the library of the University of South Carolina. Wofford Hall, a women's residence hall constructed in 1967 at her alma mater, is named in her honor, and her family presented the school with a portrait of her, painted by a fellow Winthrop alumna, after her death. The school also offers a scholarship in her honor.

Part of this collection were six cocktail dresses that were inspired by the paintings of Piet Mondrian (1872‚Äì1944). Because these six dresses played a major role in this collection the collection is called the Mondrian Collection. In academic literature it has been questioned whether this name fully covers the aim of the collection, since there are other artists who inspired Saint Laurent such as Poliakoff and Malevich. However, Mondrian seemed to play a leading role in this collection. Design and construction The six wool jersey and silk A-line Mondrian dresses comprised graphic black lines and blocks of white and primary colour, directly referencing the work of Mondrian. Rather than being printed, the dresses were made of pre-dyed fabrics, each colour in their design being an individual piece of fabric. Saint Laurent experimented with the interplay of lines by integrating them in the seams of the garment and giving a seemingly seam-free construction.Hoh√© & Sloof, p.138 The weight of the fabrics used ensured that the dresses hung straight, without draping or movement to distort the simplicity of the effect - features that enhanced the Modernism theme of the designs. In interviews Saint Laurent acknowledged that Mondrian inspired him to focus on simple dresses with minimal decoration.Berg√©, p. 21 Although the overall effect appeared simple, the technique was complex and required precision cutting and work-intensive haute couture techniques to achieve successfully, making the dresses expensive. =Precedents= Although Saint Laurent's Mondrian dresses were very successful, it was noted that several other designers had produced very similar works beforehand. In 1965, a New York reporter noted that the Mondrian dresses closely resembled two-colour jersey dresses that had already been produced and widely retailed by the French designer Mich√®le Rosier. The New York Times claimed that the effect of the Mondrian dresses had been achieved two years previously by the American designer John Kloss. Convergence of fashion and art The convergence of fashion and art in the Mondrian dresses is significant.Sung Bok Kim, p.55 Whilst reflecting the fashionable Western silhouette, the designs also reflect the significance of the work of artists like Mondrian during the sixties. The abstract, geometric visual language of the modernistic Dutch movement De Stijl to which Mondrian belonged was applied to the design of the six dresses. Saint Laurent was known for his love of fine art, and had an extensive collection covering a wide range of periods and styles which had important influence on his work. He said of Mondrian: ‚ÄòMondrian is purity and one can go no further in purity in painting. This is a purity that joins with that of the Bauhaus. The masterpiece of the twentieth century is a Mondrian‚Äô.Berg√©, p.168 The dresses have been described as a canvas on which Saint Laurent experimented with his artistic ideas,Sung Bok Kim, p. 57 and have become regarded as having captured the Zeitgest of their era. As icons of 1965 fashion the dresses have been described as giving a new perspective on haute couture - namely that it didn't have to consist of a total look any more, and that it could be easy to wear. Popularity The Mondrian collection was widely published in many fashion magazines, with one dress featuring on the cover of Vogue in 1965. Mondrian style dresses became very popular, with many mass manufacturers producing copies of the designs for lower prices, which were then widely circulated. In museums Original Mondrian dresses can be found in several museums around the world, including the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the V&A; Museum in London, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\\"Yves Saint Laurent: 'Mondrian' day dress (C.I.69.23)\\".

The label has helped introduce Brazilian baile funk and Angolan kuduro to clubs around the world. Recently, it has popularized moombahton, a genre of electronic dance music created by DJ Dave Nada. The genre on the label was mostly popularized by Dillon Francis after collaborating with Diplo on Francis's 2012 track \\"Que Que\\". The label is also known for its series of concerts in major cities known as the Mad Decent Block Party. History Mad Decent was founded in 2006 by Diplo. In 2010, the label moved from Philadelphia to Los Angeles. In 2011, it announced the launch of the imprint label Jeffrees as \\"an outlet to curate and promote new music that errs on the side of experimental, in keeping with the label‚Äôs original mission.\\" The label gained more attention in 2012 and 2013, with the worldwide success of Baauer's single \\"Harlem Shake\\", which went viral on YouTube. Since 2008, the label has created a multiple city Mad Decent Block Party tour throughout the United States. This travelling festival began at a much smaller scale with simply a rented tent, dunk tank and bbq on a Philadelphia street (Block of 12th St. and Spring Garden St.). The event is in line with the overall concept of the label showcasing global pop and dance music. The featured artists at the events has expanded from featuring Mad Decent's roster to high-profile artists such as Matt and Kim and Outkast. For Christmas 2013, the label re-released various singles from the label mixed with Christmas songs. These were compiled in an eight-track EP titled A Very Decent Christmas. Mad Decent has seen four subsequent Christmas albums out on the label since the initial compilation. 2015 saw Mad Decent release Major Lazer's \\"Lean On,\\" which Spotify named the most streamed song of all time that year.

(, stylized as JUUL Labs) is an American electronic cigarette company which spun off from Pax Labs in 2017. It makes the Juul e-cigarette, which packages nicotine salts from leaf tobacco into one-time use cartridges. Juul Labs was co-founded by Adam Bowen and James Monsees. It is headquartered in San Francisco. Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris Companies), acquired a 35% stake in Juul Labs for $12.8 billion on December 20, 2018. Juul received a $2 billion bonus to distribute among its 1,500 employees. The Juul became the most popular e-cigarette in the United States at the end of 2017 and had a market share of 72% as of September 2018. Its widespread use by youth has triggered concern from the public health community and multiple investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Given the high nicotine concentrations in Juul, the nicotine-related health consequences of its use by young people could be more severe than those from their use of other e-cigarette products.  History  In 2005, two former cigarette smokers, Adam Bowen and James Monsees met while they were graduate students in product- design at Stanford University and developed an e-cigarette called Ploom; , and later created the Pax vaporizer device for cannabis and loose-leaf tobacco before founding Juul. by 2007, they started a business by the same name. In 2015, the company sold Ploom, changed their name to Pax Labs, and developed Juul. Juul Labs, Inc. was founded on May 22, 2015. The Juul electronic cigarette was introduced by Pax Labs in June 2015. In July 2017, Juul Labs was spun out of PAX Labs as an independent company, with Tyler Goldman, former CEO of PAX Labs, named as CEO of Juul after the spin-off. In December 2017, Goldman was replaced by Kevin Burns. Co-founder James Monsees worked as Chief Product Officer and board member at Juul. Co-founder Adam Bowen worked as Chief Technology Officer and board member at Juul. Other board members include Nicholas Pritzker, whose family owned chewing tobacco giant Conwood, Riaz Valani, and Hoyoung Huh. The company grew from 200 employees in September 2017 to 1,500 by the end of 2018. , the Juul e-cigarette is manufactured in Shenzhen, China while the pods are made in the United States. Pods are also referred to as, \\"vape juice.\\" In July 2018, Juul raised $650 million, giving it a valuation of $15 billion. On December 20, 2018, Altria, one of the world's largest cigarette manufacturers, bought 35% of Juul for $12.8 billion. According to Wells Fargo, the deal valued Juul Labs at $38 billion. At the time, Juul had an annual revenue of about $2 billion. Juul bought a building in San Francisco in 2019 for almost $400 million. In April 2018, former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley joined Juul, working in the government affairs team to coordinate lobbying for the product, while advocating against underage usage. As a former attorney general, lobbying attorneys general for the vaping industry has called into question the ethics of Coakley's work for Juul, a leader in the electronic cigarette industry accused of marketing addictive nicotine products to youths. On June 13, 2019, United States House of Representatives launched an investigation into the company, looking into the business deal with Altria, social media and advertising practices, and communications. The investigation was spearheaded by Illinois Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. The subcommittee found that \\"Juul appears to be violating FDA regulations against making unapproved express and implied claims that its product helps users stop smoking cigarettes and is safer than cigarettes\\". On September 25, 2019, it was announced that Kevin Burns was stepping down as CEO and KC Crosthwaite, the Chief Growth Officer for Altria, would be taking over the role. In October 2019, it was reported that Juul planned to layoff approximately 500 workers by the end of 2019. In October 2019, executives including Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher, Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould, Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers, and Senior Vice President of advanced technologies David Foster departed from the company. On October 31, 2019, Altria announced that it was writing down $4.5 billion of the investment it had made in Juul by recording the pre-tax charge in its 3rd quarter results. = Executive team = KC Crosthwaite - CEO Adam Bowen - Founder, Chief Technology Officer James Monsees - Founder, Chief Product Officer. In March 2020, it was reported that Monsees was planning to step down from his role at the company. He would also be stepping down as an adviser and board member. Jose Luis Murillo - Chief regulatory officer (Previous position was Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, Altria) = VMR Products = thumb VMR Products LLC was an electronic cigarette company. The company marketed brands of e-cigarettes and vaporizers, including V2, V2 Pro, Vapor Couture and Vapour2. In July 2014, Time referred to the company as \\"the market leader in online sales of e-cigs\\". A February 2015 article in The Financial Times claimed the company is the \\"largest online seller of e-cigarettes in the world\\". In 2015 they announced a plan to hire at least thirty more workers within a year. In October 2018 Juul Labs, Inc. purchased VMR Products, the parent company of V2 e-cigarettes in a $75 million deal. It was reported that the rationale for the acquisition of VMR products was to gain access to the Chinese market. VMR Products was owned at the time by Huabao International Holdings. Huabao is approved to sell vapor products by the Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, the government agency that controls the tobacco market in China.  Investors  Current company investors include Tiger Global Management, mutual fund firm Fidelity Investments, and Tao Capital. In June 2018, Juul reportedly raised $1.2 billion in a financing round that valued the company at more than $16 billion. Around the same time TPG Capital declined to invest in Juul due to ethical concerns. Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris Companies), acquired a 35% stake in Juul Labs for $12.8 billion on December 20, 2018. Altria is the parent company of Marlboro, who holds more combustable cigarette market share than the next 7 brands combined. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Altria's investment in Juul was pushed by the fact that many smokers were switching to the electronic variant and Altria's own e-cigarette product, MarkTen, was not selling well. Critics have cited the acquisition as proof that the vaping industry and \\"big tobacco\\", who for years denied the link between smoking and health complications, are increasingly one and the same. Shortly after the deal, which also allowed Juul to be sold in more places, then FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called out the combined company for \\"deviating from the representation that they already made to the agency about steps they are taking to restrict their products in a way that will decrease access to kids,\\"  Design  alt=A person using a Juul device. The Juul e-cigarette looks like a USB flash drive, and it is recharged using a magnetic USB dock. It Juul e-cigarettes use nicotine salts (protonated nicotine) from leaf-based tobacco for its key ingredient, rather than free-base nicotine. Juul received a US patent for its nicotine salt preparation in 2015. The nicotine salts are said to create an experience more like smoking than other e-cigarettes on the market, as Juul attempts to deliver a nicotine peak in five minutes, similar to a traditional cigarette. Each cartridge (called a \\"Juul pod\\") contains about the same amount of nicotine as one pack of cigarettes and delivers approximately 200 puffs. The amount of nicotine in each cartridge ‚Äì 59 mg/ml in the United States, limited to 20 mg/ml in the European Union ‚Äì is substantially more than the majority of e-cigarettes on the market. In August 2018, Juul introduced pods in 3 percent strengths for its mint and Virginia tobacco flavors. This is equivalent to 30 mg/ml. Each cartridge contains propylene glycol, glycerin, flavorings, and nicotine salts. Protonated nicotine lacks the harshness of tobacco smoke. According to Tory Spindle of Johns Hopkins University, \\"Protonated nicotine formulations are problematic because they seemingly allow users to inhale much higher nicotine concentrations that they would otherwise be able to.\\" Juul pods came in eight flavors until late 2019, of which mango was the most popular. A Juul starter kit sells for about $50. Joel Johnson of co.design described the nicotine intake as \\"eye-widening\\" and its aesthetics as \\"demure\\". Upon initial release, Ben Radding of Men's Fitness called Juul the \\"iPhone of E-cigs\\", but said that it required \\"getting used to\\". The comparison to the iPhone and other Apple products has been made by many other commentators. Pharmacologist James Pauly, a specialist in nicotine, notes that Juul delivers more nicotine than other e-cigarettes, and that the salts also may reduce the harshness, making it easier for new smokers, such as teenagers, to consume more nicotine than they are aware of. In August 2019, a spokesperson for Juul Labs said that the company was exploring an option similar to the deposit system for Juul pods to reduce marine pollution(which was proposed by Yogi Hale Hendlin, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco). The spokesperson mentioned in an email that the company is committed to responsible stewardship and environmental sustainability.  Usage  = Prevalence among adolescents = Juul's products have become immensely popular among teenagers, raising concerns among the public health community that long-term declines in youth nicotine use are being reversed. An October 2018 study of 13,000 Americans found that 9.5% of teenagers aged 15‚Äì17 and 11% of young adults aged 18‚Äì21 currently use Juul, and that teenagers age 15‚Äì17 are 16 times more likely to be Juul users than 25‚Äì34 year olds. Juul use is also very popular among middle school and high school students; with one in five students between 12 and 17 having seen a Juul used in school. Teenagers use the verb \\"Juuling\\" to describe their use of Juul. The National Drug Trends of 2018 revealed increasing adolescent use of e-cigarettes, including the Juul. Cigarette smoking rates among 12th graders continued to decline as it has been for two decades. On the other hand, the increase in vaping rates from 2017 to 2018 was the largest gap recorded since the study began in 1975. Researchers hypothesize this may be due to the number of educational programs implemented to warn youth of the risks of cigarette smoking, while there is still a lack of programs regarding vaping devices. The percentage of 12th grade students who reported vaping nicotine almost doubled, from 11% in 2017 to 21% in 2018. Among 10th graders, the percentage doubled from 8% to 16%. Furthermore, a Truth Initiative study found that of 15 to 17-year-old teenagers who use Juul, 56% used the device more than three times a month. Over 25% of teenagers reported using the Juul more than ten times a month. These findings suggest that teenagers are not just experimenting with Juuls, but rather using them on a regular basis. The creators of the Juul, James Monsees and Adam Bowen, claim the mission of the Juul is to improve adult smokers' lives by eliminating cigarettes. Many reasons have been proposed for Juul's popularity among teenagers, including adolescents' misperception that Juul is safe, ease of concealment, sleek high-tech design, and fruity pod flavors. A 2015 Stanford University study analyzing adolescents‚Äô perceptions of risks and benefits of conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes found that some of the participants believed that e-cigarettes did not contain nicotine, only water vapor. Additionally, the 2017 Truth Initiative survey found 63% of teens and young adults did not understand that the Juul products they used always contains nicotine. A lack of educational programs and public health campaigns regarding the use of e-cigarettes and Juuls reflect how teenagers may perceive these devices as many of the risks are still unknown. Former PAX Labs CEO Goldman said to Fortune in 2016 that \\"Juul should not be used by those under the legal age, nor should any nicotine products, as stated by the U.S. Surgeon General.\\" In 2018 Matt Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco- Free Kids, said the design \\"misleads about risk\\" of addiction. Juul's resemblance to a flash drive and very compact size makes it easy to conceal, and its low vapor output and subtle scent, which can be passed off as perfume, mean that it can be used discreetly, even in class. Accordingly, it is easy to conceal in clothing or elsewhere; a high school in Newton, Massachusetts discovered a Juul disguised as a Sharpie, for instance. Juul's resemblance to an iPhone, as well as its compact and high-tech design, are other commonly cited reasons for its rising popularity among young people. Juul's sweet flavors, especially the fruit and cr√®me br√ªl√©e ones, are especially attractive to teenagers, according to journalists, academics, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Unlike cigarette smoke's smell, Juuls can emit a fruity scent when vaped. In a 2016 study by the CDC and FDA, 31% of middle and high school students who use e-cigarettes claimed they used them due to the availability of flavors. In response, Juul renamed some flavors‚Äî\\"cool cucumber\\" to \\"cucumber\\", \\"cr√®me br√ªl√©e\\" to \\"creme\\", and \\"classic menthol\\" to \\"menthol\\"‚Äîsaying that it \\"heard the criticism\\" and \\"responded by simplifying the names and losing the descriptors.\\" As of November 2018, Juul put a halt on all flavored pods to prevent the increase in teen usage. Many of Juul's early marketing campaigns were youth-oriented, with prominent use of social media, youth-friendly themes, and young models pictured using Juuls. In July 2019, Juul spent thousands of dollars to promote Juul as a smoking cessation to kids in schools. Juul made false claims about it being \\"completely safe\\" and presented opportunites for teens to become influencers for the company. In response to the FDA crackdown on Juul, the company announced they would be using real customers who were using the product to switch from smoking instead of models. As of November 2018, Juul has shut down their social media accounts. A May 2018 Truth Initiative survey found that 74% of Juul users ages 12‚Äì17 obtained their Juul device from a brick and mortar store, 52% from a friend or family member, and 6% online (respondents could select multiple answers). For context, Juul estimates that 90% of its sales are in brick and mortar stores. The survey also found that 89% of youth attempts to buy a Juul online succeeded. However, Juul changed its age-verification policies in October 2018 in response to FDA pressure, with employees manually checking drivers licenses against public records for exact matches, rejecting anyone under 21 but also rejecting or deterring many adults.  Health concerns  In a documentary for CNBC, Burns said that the effect of vaping on Juul users, including minors, is unknown. Burns told Carl Quintanilla, \\"Frankly, we don't know today. We have not done the long-term, longitudinal clinical testing that we need to do.\\" In sampling multiple e-cigarette delivery systems, a 2019 study found Juul pods were the only product to demonstrate in vitro cytotoxicity from both nicotine and flavor chemical content, in particular ethyl maltol. Vape liquid pods may contain numerous other compounds and are known to provide unreliable nicotine delivery that is often inconsistent with the labeling. These liquid pods also contain propylene glycol, which has been shown to induce airway epithelial injury and deep airway inflammation. Due to a story about the vaped-induced lung disease in the US, an upsurge of people began tweeting about giving up Juuling within a 24 hour period. = Nicotine content = One Juul pod contains the same amount of nicotine as one to two packs of cigarettes. The nicotine content of Juuls is higher than other e-cigarette brands with its volume of e-liquid containing 5% nicotine, almost double the amount of other brands. Juul pods also contain a greater amount of benzoic acid, 44.8 mg/mL, as compared to other brands, which contain around 0.2 to 2 mg/mL. Constant exposure to benzoic acid can lead to coughing, sore throat, and abdominal pain. \\"When Juul came out with very high-nicotine electronic cigarettes, it triggered a nicotine arms race amongst competitive companies seeking to emulate the success of Juul,\\" Robert Jackler, head of Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising, stated in 2019. In certain markets such as Israel the maximum legal limit is 1.7% for the amount of nicotine allowed in its pods, but in the US Juul does not offer 1.7%. Juul does not offer low-dose or no-dose nicotine pods. Juuls are unique from other e-cigarettes in that they use nicotine salts rather than freebase nicotine in order to reproduce the effects of conventional cigarettes. Nicotine salts are also less acidic than freebase nicotine, making them easier to inhale. Additionally, nicotine salts are more readily absorbed into the bloodstream at a rate similar to conventional cigarettes. Due to its lack of irritation and easiness to inhale, users may be unaware of how much nicotine they are actually intaking. Given the high nicotine concentrations in Juul, the nicotine-related health consequences of its use by young people could be more severe than those from their use of other e-cigarette products. Ari Atkins, Pax Labs' R&D; engineer, said \\"We don't think a lot about addiction here because we‚Äôre not trying to design a cessation product at all.\\" He added, \\"anything about health is not on our mind.\\" In April 2018, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb stated that the nicotine in Juul is sufficient to result in addiction. Gottlieb further stated, \\"In some cases, our kids are trying these products and liking them without even knowing they contain nicotine. And that's a problem, because as we know the nicotine in these products can rewire an adolescent's brain, leading to years of addiction.\\" In late 2018, news reports noted increasing rates of Juul addiction in teenagers, which negatively impacts brain development and relationships. Juul's high nicotine content has attracted concern because of nicotine's addictive properties. Particular concern has been expressed about the lack of vaping cessation treatments for adolescents, and the FDA scheduled a public hearing on youth vaping cessation for January 18, 2019.  Market share  = United States = Sales of Juul increased 700% in 2016. , Juul accounts for over 70% of the US e-cigarette market monitored by Nielsen. Juul's market share in the US has increased by 10 percentage points since April 2018. According to Juul Labs, 90% of Juul products are purchased at retail stores . Juul plans to sell their products internationally. According to Dow Jones VentureSource, Juul Labs was the sixth-most valuable US startup in July 2018, behind Uber and Airbnb. Juul's revenue in 2018 was over $1 billion, up from approximately $245 million in 2017. Sales totaled $1.1 billion for the year ending July 2018. Juul's success has inspired a flood of imitators, namely pod-mod devices with similar boxy designs. These devices come from companies ranging from startups to \\"Big Tobacco\\" company R.J. Reynolds. The company filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in early-October 2018 over counterfeit products manufactured by companies in the United States and China that Juul Labs says infringed on its US patents. The complaint seeks to end importation of these products into the US. In February 2019, Juul sued several companies for infringing on its trademarks, among which was a cartoon logo titled the Juul Monster. = International = In May 2018, Juul started selling in Israel, which did not regulate e-cigarettes at the time. Israel later banned JUUL in August 2018, citing public health concerns, according to a statement by the Ministry of Health. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, acting in his capacity as Health Minister, placed a complete ban on Juul because it delivers nearly three times Israel's recommended amount of 20 mg/ml of nicotine. Juul has appealed the ban to Israel's High Court of Justice. In July 2018, Juul announced it would launch in the United Kingdom. Flavours sold in the UK have slightly different names from the American versions and contain 1.7% nicotine, translating to 20 mg/ml, to comply with local regulations. It was noted that the UK was chosen as an early launch market as it had the world's most supportive government when it came to encouraging smokers to vape. In August 2018, Juul introduced its products in Canada, starting with an online launch before introducing them to vape shops, gas stations, and convenience stores in early September. Juul launched in Russia in late-2018 and launched in South Korea and Ireland in May 2019. Juul launched in Ukraine in June 2019. At the beginning of 2019, Juul started selling products containing 1.7% nicotine in Germany. In January 2019, Juul announced plans for a launch in India. In response, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare called for the device to be banned from India, citing concerns that it could derail the government's anti-tobacco programs. The regulation of e-cigarettes in India is disputed between the government and the judiciary. Six states have banned their use, though the Delhi High Court has stayed the bans. As such, Juul e-cigarettes are not legally available in India and they are commonly sold on the Gray market for as much as $100 for the starter kit that costs $29 in the United States. In June 2019, they announced plans for their products to be available in the Philippine market. On January 25, 2020 it was announced that Grant Winterton, president of Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Ken Bishop, president of Asia-Pacific South divisions, were both leaving the company amid global cost-saving and restructuring. Winterton was reported to organized high-profile, expensive events as part of the companies efforts. Among them was a conference in Berlin last May, attended by 1,500 employees, and a meeting for his direct reports in Cannes, France, in July, according to two employees.  Marketing  Juul has been intensively marketed via Instagram and other social media. Of the $2.2 million Juul spent on marketing in 2015 and 2016, $1 million went to online marketing, according to data from Kantar Media. Juul's heavy reliance on social media marketing is unique among major e-cigarette brands in the US‚Äîblu and NJOY were initially promoted mainly with television advertising while Vuse and MarkTen relied on promotional expenditures to consumers and retailers‚Äîand is touted as a major reason for its success. Juul's use of social media marketing is also relatively inexpensive: to promote Vuse, R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company spent over $16 million on television ads alone in 2015 and 2016, according to Kantar data. A 2018 study found that \\"Juul's social media activities were highly correlated with Juul retail sales.\\" Juul's marketing has been criticized for targeting youth. The themes emphasized in Juul's marketing, especially freedom, relaxation, and sex appeal; the use of young models and imagery claimed to be appealing to young people; and the use of social media influencers and affiliates popular among youth are three reasons why many consider Juul's marketing to be targeting youth. In 2015, John Schachter, director of state communications for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, voiced concern regarding the youth of men and women portrayed in Juul's advertising, particularly in combination with the design, stating that \\"We're seeing more and more irresponsible marketing of unregulated products such as e-cigarettes.\\" Similarly, the campaign's vice-president of communications Wilmore stated that Juul Labs \\"used the same imagery and themes that tobacco companies have always used to appeal to kids, and they fueled it with social media.\\" A student testified at a Congressional hearing in 2019 that a Juul spokesperson purportedly told high school students that its products are \\"totally safe\\". Juul Labs argues that its marketing is targeted at adult cigarette smokers who are looking to quit. The rectangular design of the Juul e-cigarette, for example, was chosen to avoid reminding smokers of a cigarette, according to a Juul executive. In September 2018, Juul implemented a new marketing code to avoid the appearance of targeting youth. Changes brought about by the new code include only showcasing former smokers age 35 or older in ads, no longer featuring models on social media, removing social media accounts that marketed online, and adding the label \\"the alternative for adult smokers\\" to its packaging and many of its ads. Juul took down all of its social media accounts that November. Fans accounts including @Doit4Juul, which had more followers than the main Juul's Instagram account, have not closed down. In January 2019, Juul announced a $10 million advertising campaign for cable television and radio, which targets current adult smokers and attempts to rebrand Juul as a switching product. In March 2019, it was reported that Juul was pitching itself to employers and insurers to help their employees stop smoking cigarettes. As part of its \\"enterprise marketing\\", Juul is reportedly looking at identifying participants and offer them discounted products as well as \\"coaching\\" and other support including educational articles and instructional videos. On September 9, 2019, the US FDA warned Juul to stop its deceptive marketing practices. On September 25, 2019, Juul announced that they would stop all marketing in the United States. Juul's marketing approaches to youth in the UK has been restricted in October 2019 after a settlement was reached with the Center for Environmental Health. =Changes to marketing practices in the US= On October 17, 2019 Juul agreed to make changes to its youth advertising practices as part of a settlement with the Center for Environmental Health. The first legally binding agreement establishes the right for the Center for Environmental Health to sue Juul if they violate any portion of the agreement. The agreement states that Juul will not: * Advertise or promote its products in media whose audience is 15% or more under the age of 21 * Market or advertise on social media (except for Juul's age-restricted YouTube channel) * Use models under the age of 28 in its advertisements * Advertise within 1000 feet of schools or playgrounds * Sponsor or advertise at sporting events or concerts that allow people under the age of 21 * Pay for or permit company employees or contractors to appear at school or youth-oriented educational programs or events * continue to use the terms \\"adults only\\" or \\"not for use by minors,\\" which may entice minors to use Juul products, and replace them with the phrase \\"the sale of tobacco products to minors is prohibited by law\\" * allow unlimited purchase of its product and sets clear limits on bulk sales of Juul products at brick and mortar outlets, as well as on-line Lastly the settlement also requires Juul to continue its \\"secret shopper\\" program with specific rules on actions the company must take if a store sells a product to a Juul secret shopper without asking for proof of age. =Discontinuation of flavored pods= On October 17, 2019 Juul announced that it would discontinue its mango, creme, fruit and cucumber flavors that were sold through its online store. The tobacco, mint and menthol flavors would remain for sale. The discontinuation of these products would only be applicable in the US, with all other countries continuing to sell flavored pods. In November 2019 Juul announced they would discontinue selling mint flavored pods in the US. = The Switch Network = On October 1, 2019 it was reported that Juul had set up a lobbying campaign designed to look like a grassroots movement, called the switch network. The goal is to recruit consumers who are prepared to sign petitions, contact local officials, attend public rally's or protests, testify in public hearings or share their stories with the press. = California Democratic Party Conference in USA 2019 = Juul was one of the corporate sponsors of the California Democratic Party Conference from May 31 through June 2, 2019. The logo of the company was prominently displayed on a large screen while the Speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi was speaking. = Conservative Party Conference in UK 2019 = Juul Labs sponsored two events with the Centre for Policy Studies a think tank and pressure group in the United Kingdom at the Conservative Party Conference (UK) The first event on September 29, 2019 was a reception in celebration of the Conservative Party's bright new thinkers. The second event on October 1, 2019 was a panel discussion with Jo Churchill, MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Care on the topic \\"Why Inequality in Britain is About More Than Money\\".  Investigations  = US Food and Drug Administration = After the FDA investigation on youth vaping, Juul reduced the promotion of some sweet flavors. In April 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that Juul Labs turn over documents to \\"better understand the reportedly high rates of youth use and the particular youth appeal of these products.\\" The FDA's request included asking the company to provide documents about the design and marketing of the Juul, research on the safety of the products, and whether certain features of the device's design appeal to specific age groups. FDA also asked eBay to remove several listings of Juul products, which eBay complied with. FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb expressed concern about how the Juul can be easily disguised as a USB flash drive and that the Juul delivers a high amount of nicotine. \\"We don't yet fully understand why these products are so popular among youth,\\" Dr. Gottlieb said, adding that \\"These documents may help us get there.\\" In response, Juul Labs stated that they would spend $30 million on a campaign to keep Juul out of the hands of young people in addition to working with the FDA, which they announced in a press release in April 2018. Juul Labs also announced their support for raising the minimum age for vaping products from 18 to 21. Juul Labs CEO Kevin Burns said, \\"we are committed to deterring young people, as well as adults who do not currently smoke from using our products. We cannot be more emphatic on this point: No young person or non- nicotine user should ever try Juul.\\" The FDA followed up by issuing more than 60 warning letters and fines to stores that were found to be illegally selling Juul products to minors. In September 2018, the FDA sent letters to Juul Labs and the manufacturers of the four other largest e-cigarette brands in the US‚ÄîR.J. Reynolds' Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' blu eCigs, and Japan Tobacco International's Logic‚Äîgiving them 60 days to lay out their plans to address widespread youth use of their products. If they fail to comply, FDA may \\"remove some or all of their flavored products that may be contributing to the rise in youth use from the market.\\" FDA also sent over 1,300 warning letters to stores that undercover investigators had found to be selling Juul and other e-cigarettes to minors, and issued 131 fines ranging from $279 to $11,182. Juul responded with a statement that \\"Juul Labs will work proactively with FDA in response to its request.\\" A Juul spokeswoman also announced that Juul has its own patrol of retailers who advertise to youths or who do not enforce age requirements, noting that it had requested the removal of over 5,500 posts from Instagram, 144 posts from Facebook Marketplace, and 33 from Amazon.com. In total, Instagram removed 4,562 of 5,500 posts, Facebook Marketplace removed 45 of 145, and Amazon took down 13 of 33. An April 2018 survey by the Truth Initiative found that 89% of adolescents who attempted to buy Juul online succeeded, however, and Gottlieb said that Juul's efforts \\"didn't have the intended impact or I wouldn't be viewing the statistics I'm now seeing.\\" The FDA made an unannounced inspection of Juul headquarters in late September 2018 to gather information on the firm's marketing methods. FDA announced afterwards that it had seized thousands of pages of documents on Juul Labs' marketing practices. Shares of three Big Tobacco companies‚ÄîAltria, Philip Morris International, and British American Tobacco‚Äîrose at the news of the inspection. On November 13, 2018, 60 days after the FDA's ultimatum, Juul announced it would stop accepting retail orders for mango, fruit, creme, and cucumber Juul pods in compliance with the FDA's investigation. Juul will continue to sell Virginia Tobacco, Classic Tobacco, and Menthol in retail stores, and noted that it will renew retail sales of its other flavors at stores that invest in age-verification technology. In addition, the company said they would shut down their Facebook and Instagram accounts in the U.S. that promote the use of flavored pods, which entice underage users. In September 2019, President Donald Trump made an announcement that there would be a possible ban implemented on a majority of flavored e-cigarettes with the exception of menthol. = United States Attorney for the Northern District of California investigations = The United States Attorney for the Northern District of California has launched a criminal investigation into the company Juul, The Wall Street Journal reported on September 23, 2019. = San Joaquin County Attorney's Office Investigations = The San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office announced an investigation into JUUL Labs on October 1, 2019. The charges are for violations of the California Business and Professions Code specifically for unfair business practice and for false and misleading information being provided to the public which results in harm. = Multi state investigation in the United States = On February 25, 2020 it was announced that 39 U.S. states were looking into the marketing and sales of vaping products made by Juul. The scope of the investigation includes whether the company targeted youths and made misleading claims about nicotine content in its devices. Attorneys general from Connecticut, Florida, Nevada, Oregon and Texas said they will be leading the multi-state investigation.  Lawsuits  As of September 21, 2019, Juul Labs is a defendant in 56 lawsuits in federal court. Various governments have alleged in suits the Juul markets an unsafe product to children, including state attorneys general in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina,Healey files lawsuit against JUUL, alleging a campaign to lure underage teens and school districts Three Village Central in New York, La Conner in Washington, Olathe in Kansas, and Francis Howell in Missouri. Individual suits for damages caused by injury and wrongful death allege that Juul products were addictive and inappropriately marketed as safe and not addictive and were advertised and sold online to minors. The family of one teenager alleged he was enticed by Juul's \\"candy-like flavors, sleek and discreet design, and its representations that it was a healthier alternative to combustible cigarettes.\\" Juul did not put nicotine warnings on their products until August 2018, according to one complaint. Investor class action lawsuits were also filed on behalf on behalf of shareholders of Altria Group, alleging Altria failed to conduct sufficient due diligence prior to the company's investment in Juul, failed to inform the investors about risks associated with Juul's products and marketing practices, the mounting public scrutiny and its impact on the Altria business as well as that at times the companies public statements were false and misleading. In October 2019, a lawsuit was filed in US District Court for the Northern District of California by Siddharth Breja, who was the former senior vice president of global finance for Juul. Breja contends he was fired in March 2019, a week after voicing concerns regarding Juul's contaminated products. In February 2019, Breja disagreed with selling pods that were close to a year old. In response then Juul CEO Kevin Burns allegedly said, \\"Half our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\\" A representative for Burns relayed a message made by Burns to Vice: \\"I never said this, or anything remotely close to this, period. As CEO, I had the company make huge investments in product quality and the facts will show this claim is absolutely false and pure fiction.\\"  Counterfeit pods  Counterfeit Juul pods are being manufactured in China. Juul has filed lawsuits against 30 Chinese companies. Counterfeit Juul-compatible pods have been sold on Alibaba.  E-cigarette bans  In June 2019, the City of San Francisco passed legislation banning the sale of e-cigarettes online as well as offline, and a separate ordinance preventing e-cigarette manufacturers from occupying city-owned property. Proponents of the bill have said that they want the bill to serve as a warning to Juul that they were not wanted in the city. The decision to ban sales to the city was to ensure that the FDA began its pre- market review of e-cigarette products immediately. The San Francisco Port Commission, which owns and operates the heritage structure at Pier 70, has supported the legislation to prevent Juul and also companies that are active in the tobacco, firearms and alcohol business from occupying property that belongs to the city. Because the June 2019 ordinance did not apply retroactively, Juul was able to maintain its location at Pier 70. Juul spent at least $4.3 million in support of Proposition C to try to rescind the ban on flavored e-cigarettes in San Francisco. On September 30, 2019, Juul announced it will no longer actively support Proposition C.

Biography  MacBain was raised as a conservative Southern Baptist and she wanted to be a pastor like her father when she grew up. MacBain recalls that she felt that God had called her to become a pastor at an early age. MacBain eventually became the pastor of Lake Jackson United Methodist Church in Florida. After serving in ministry for many years, she began to question her faith. Aspects of the Bible did not seem 'to add up', but MacBain was not able to reconcile those questions. =Losing faith= During her time as a pastor, MacBain began to have questions about difficult Biblical passages, the problem of evil, and suffering. She considered her questions carefully, initially believing this would strengthen her faith. As MacBain worked through her doubts she \\"found that religion had so many holes in it, [that she] couldn't believe it.\\" . MacBain told the Christian Post that her process of becoming an atheist was gradual. She states that she had no issues with the church structure or organization: her deconversion was \\"just theological.\\" She pointed to \\"the contradictory nature of the Bible; the lack of scientific or historical foundation or accuracy\\" as starting points to her questioning her faith. MacBain cites contradictions in the Bible, also tough questions like, ‚ÄúWhere was God when the hurricane hit killing so many innocent people?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow could God condemn someone to hell who has never even heard of him?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWould a loving God torment people for eternity?‚Äù A time came when MacBain could no longer ignore these types of questions. In late 2011, MacBain realized she was an atheist. =The Clergy Project= MacBain became one of the first pastors helped by The Clergy Project, a group for clergy who have lost their faith. She joined in 2011 under the pseudonym \\"Lynn.\\" MacBain felt less alone with the support of The Clergy Project. but still could not easily escape her work. MacBain applied for alternative employment but could not explain why she wanted to leave the ministry. She became the Clergy Project's first female \\"graduate.\\" =Leaving the ministry= MacBain left the ministry in March 2012. After coming to terms with the conclusion that she did not believe in God any longer, she felt that leaving her position as pastor was the right thing to do. She \\"came out\\" publicly as an atheist at the 2012 American Atheists convention. After she came out as an atheist, she said: \\"An enormous number of Christians have threatened to do physical harm to me. Many others have been kind in their response.\\" MacBain reported that she was also ostracized by friends and extended family, but that her husband and children were supportive. American Atheists named her \\"Atheist of the Year\\" in 2012. After she lost her job and said that other \\"job interviews were cancelled\\" in her hometown of Tallahassee, the Humanists of Florida Association helped by offering to pay her salary for a year. =Subsequent life= MacBain worked as the Public Relations Director for American Atheists for a brief period of time. She moved back to Florida in 2013 to work as the Executive Director of the Humanists of Florida. Later that year, she was hired as the director of the Humanist Community Project at Harvard. She moved from Florida to the Cambridge area. Her work with the Humanist Community Project was to help secular communities build connections, and if they wanted to, secular alternatives to church. MacBain was part of a controversy in 2013 when it came out that she had fraudulently listed a Masters of Divinity from Duke University on her resume to Harvard. She was quoted in saying \\"I have committed a grave error in judgment that I deeply regret. While I did not do anything with malice or intention to harm others, my actions were still wrong.\\" MacBain stated in a public apology that many assumed she had a M.Div, but she was not initially aware of this fact. She also admitted that once she became aware of the situation, she was not sure of how to remedy the situation. In her public apology, she indicated that her inaction led to the situation at Harvard. It was true that she attended Duke, but only for the first year summer course in the United Methodist Church Course of Study for Local Pastors. (University course credit is not granted through this program.) After the controversy, MacBain continued to be active in supporting nontheists in their activities to build alternatives to church, such as helping communities create Sunday Assemblies. MacBain describes the importance of communities for secular people, \\"We all need a place to belong, to be accepted and supported, to celebrate life and mourn loss, and to just have fun.\\" =Returning to faith= MacBain is no longer involved with the freethought movement, and has returned to her faith. After several years as a prominent atheist, MacBain returned to a life of faith, stating ‚ÄúWhen I was at my lowest point, I found God right there beside me. Realizing the true meaning of grace led me to embrace life as a Progressive Christian.‚Äù Her journey brought her to a place where she is \\"ok with not being able to define everything\\" and describes her faith as \\"an honest belief where questions are a part of the experience.\\" She currently lives in Alabama where she works as an adjunct instructor and is a musician in a local band.\\"http://teresamacbain.comhttps://meritpages.com/teresamacbain She completed a BA in Organizational Leadership in 2018, graduating summa cum laude and an MS ed in Instructional Design and Technology in 2019 from Samford University in Birmingham, AL. https://meritpages.com/teresamacbain See also *John W.

Its purpose was to renew and solidify friendship between Colonial Americans and the Cherokee People following the three-year war. The endeavor is named after the commander of the expedition, Henry Timberlake. Organization The Timberlake Expedition was organized in 1761 by Colonel Adam Stephen. The expressed purpose of the expedition was to visit the Overhill Cherokee (in present-day Tennessee) to verify that an end of hostilities of the Anglo- Cherokee War had taken place in the Virginia back-country. Stephen gave command of the expedition to Timberlake, who had volunteered for the assignment.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.38‚Äì39. Timberlake was accompanied by Sergeant Thomas Sumter (who funded the expedition), John McCormack (an interpreter), and a servant. The small group purchased a canoe and ten days' worth of provisions with money Sumter had borrowed. The planned route was to follow the Holston River to its confluence with the French Broad River, and proceed to the Little Tennessee River, where the five main Overhill towns were situated.Robert Bass, Gamecock: The Life and Campaigns of General Thomas Sumter (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1961), 9. The expedition begins Timberlake's party left Long Island-on-the-Holston on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually low water levels slowed their progress, as the party had to drag or portage the canoe over and around exposed shoals and sandbars. They ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately above the river. Timberlake, in his journal, described Sumter's swimming nearly a half-mile in the icy waters to retrieve their canoe which had drifted away while they were exploring the cave.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.41‚Äì48. On December 13, the party reached a series of river cascades which Timberlake called \\"Great Falls.\\" The party spent a day maneuvering their way down the cascades but found the Holston frozen over immediately downstream. The ice slowed them more, but rains on the night of December 14 thawed the ice, and the party passed out of the mouth of the Holston (at the site later developed as modern Knoxville) into the Tennessee River on December 15.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.49‚Äì54. =The Overhill country= Having traveled through the Appalachian Mountains to this point, the expedition traveled more quickly on the Tennessee River. A hunting party led by the Cherokee leader, Slave Catcher, met the party near the mouth of the Little Tennessee River, and supplied the weary expedition with provisions of \\"dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn.\\"Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); p. 56. The following day Slave Catcher guided the expedition up the Little Tennessee. The colonial party struggled to keep up with the Cherokee, with Timberlake recalling, \\"my hands were so galled, that the blood trickled from them, and when we set out the next morning I was scarce able to handle a pole.\\" They arrived in the Overhill village of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by the town's head man, Ostenaco (or \\"Mankiller\\").Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.57,58. After spending several days in Tomotley as guests of Ostenaco, they proceeded to the Overhill mother-town of Chota, where a number of Cherokee town heads had gathered in the large council-house. Ostenaco gave a speech and ceremoniously buried a hatchet in the ground, symbolizing a state of peace between the English and the Cherokee. Timberlake smoked several pipes with the gathered town heads. He described it in his memoir as \\"very disagreeable,\\" but respected the ritual with the chiefs.Timberlake, Williams (ed.), Memoirs, 59‚Äì61. The party continued southward to Citico, where Timberlake was greeted with a ceremonial dance involving some four hundred Cherokee. Timberlake recalled that the dancers were \\"painted all over in a hideous manner\\" and that they \\"danced in a very uncommon figure.\\"Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); p.63. The town's head man, Cheulah, presented Timberlake with a string of beads and held another pipe-smoking ceremony. The non-stop pipe smoking made Timberlake so sick that he \\"could not stir for several hours.\\"Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); p.65. The following day, Timberlake and Ostenaco traveled to Chilhowee, the second southernmost of the Overhill towns on Timberlake's map, where the town's head man, Yachtino, held a peace procession similar to that held at Citico. =Return to Virginia= Portrait of Ostenaco by Sir Joshua Reynolds; 1762 The assignment largely completed, the party returned to Tomotley with Ostenaco on January 2, 1762. Timberlake spent the next few weeks studying Cherokee habits, making notes, and mapping the Overhill country. At the end of January, rumors began trickling in from Cherokee scouts of renewed hostilities with rival tribes to the north. Although the rumors turned out to be based on a misunderstanding, Timberlake grew anxious and begged Ostenaco to guide him back to Virginia. Ostenaco reluctantly agreed, and the party set out on March 10, 1762. Just before departure, Timberlake witnessed the ceremonial return of a war party led by Willinawaw. The party sang \\"the war-song\\" and planted a scalp-filled pole next to the council-house door.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.109‚Äì113. The Timberlake party had decided to make the return trip overland with purchased horses from the Cherokee. Ostenaco, accompanied by several hundred Cherokee warriors, guided the Timberlake group northward along what is now known as the Great Indian Warpath, which followed the western base of the Appalachian Mountains. On March 11, the party arrived at the abandoned Cherokee village of Elajoy along the Little River in what is now Maryville, Tennessee. They crossed the French Broad River the following day. A week later, they reached Fort Robinson, which the Stephen garrison had abandoned but where they left behind a large supply of flour. The expedition left Long Island-on-the-Holston on March 22, continuing northward to an abandoned army camp. there, Timberlake was disappointed to find that his belongings had been looted from a trunk. The party finally arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia on the James River in early April.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.118‚Äì129. =Trip to London= While in Williamsburg, Timberlake and the Cherokee leader Ostenaco attended a dinner party at William & Mary College at which Ostenaco professed his desire to meet the king of England. Although he feared the trip would break him financially, Timberlake agreed. In May 1762, Timberlake, Sumter, and three distinguished Cherokee leaders, including Ostenaco, departed for London.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.130‚Äì133. Arriving in early June, the Cherokee were an immediate attraction, drawing crowds all over the city. The poet, Oliver Goldsmith, waited for three hours to meet the Indians, and offered a gift to Ostenaco.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); p.136. They sat for Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint their portraits,St James Chronicle, July 3, 1762. and they met personally with King George III. The Cherokee returned to North America with Sergeant Sumter on about August 25, 1762.Timberlake, Henry; Memoirs, 1756‚Äì1765; Williams, Samuel (ed.); Marietta, Georgia: Continental Book Co.; (1948); pp.143‚Äì147. Timberlake remained behind in England. Aftermath Upon returning to the colonies, Sumter became stranded in South Carolina due to financial difficulties. He petitioned the Virginia Colony for reimbursement of his travel expenses, but was denied. He was subsequently imprisoned for debt in Virginia. When his friend and fellow soldier, Joseph Martin, arrived in Staunton, Martin asked to spend the night with Sumter in jail. He gave Sumter ten guineas and a tomahawk. Sumter used the money to buy his way out of jail in 1766.Henry Timberlake, Duane King (ed.) The Memoirs of Lt. Henry Timberlake: The Story of a Soldier, Adventurer, and Emissary to the Cherokees, 1756‚Äì1765. UNC Press, xxvii. When Martin and Sumter were reunited some thirty years later, Sumter repaid the money.

It was founded in the mid-18th century on the site of an earlier Polish Carmelite monastery.www.encyclopediaofukraine.com History Dedicated to Saint Barbara, its name preserves the memory of an earlier local Carmelite monastery founded in 1630. St Barbara's Church is regarded as a Ukrainian national architectural monument, being one of the most recognizable buildings in Berdychiv. The church was first built on its present site in 1759 by Countess Barbara Tyszkiewicz, daughter and heiress of a wealthy Lithuanian magnate whose dowry included Berdychiv. She dedicated the newly built basilica to her patron saint, Saint Barbara. Later, under Tsarist Russian-rule, the original wooden structure was demolished being replaced by an elegant stone edifice which was completed in 1826. St Barbara's Church has attracted a number of distinguished people throughout its history, in view of the Polish state's staunch adherence to the Catholic faith. In the 1820s a young and then-unknown Polish composer, Frederic Chopin, was resident in the then-Russian banking capital of Berdychiv. Having been taught to play string instruments by a Czech music professor, he set about supervising the installation of St Barbara's original pipe organ; this church organ, which the great Chopin played, was destroyed by the Communists in the 20th century. Further fame was brought to Berdychiv's main catholic church by the celebrated marriage of French author Honor√© de Balzac to his Polish aristocratic bride and landowner Countess Ewelina Ha≈Ñska in 1850. Subsequently, the eminent Anglo-Polish writer, Joseph Conrad, was baptized at the basilica in 1857. All churches throughout Russia were suppressed by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with Berdychiv's basilica being no exception; it was later converted into a People's Sports College for Children. St. Barbara's Church was reconsecrated by the Catholic Church, in 1993, to serve again as a place of worship.www.archives.gov.ua See also * Berdychiv * Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth * Roman Catholicism in Ukraine References External links *Berdychiv Revival Project: Distinguished Shrines of Berdychiv * Category:Berdychiv Category:1700s in Ukraine Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1759 Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1826 Category:Baroque architecture in Ukraine Category:Roman Catholic churches in Ukraine Category:Baroque church buildings Category:Ukrainian Catholic churches in Ukraine ","title":"St. Barbara's Church, Berdychiv"},{"id":"47779205","text":"Elsa Reichmanis (born December 9, 1953 in Melbourne, Australia) is an American chemist, who was the 2003 president of the American Chemical Society.

Wold is the Bren Professor of Molecular Biology, the principal investigator of the Wold Lab at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the principal investigator of the Functional Genomics Resource Center at the Beckman Institute at Caltech. Wold was director of the Beckman Institute at Caltech from 2001 to 2011.  Education  Barbara Wold graduated with a B. S. in zoology from Arizona State University (Tempe) in 1973. She was inspired by laboratory work with zoology professor Shelby Gerking and developmental biologist Jerry Justus, and lectures with professor emerita Kathleen Church. While at ASU, Wold became interested in understanding the informational code that regulates gene expression. She also met her husband, geophysicist Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Burdick. Wold received a Ph.D. in molecular developmental biology from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1978, studying genome structure and gene regulation during embryo development. She was appointed as a postdoctoral research fellow at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1978. There she developed methods for assaying cis-regulatory element function.  Career  Wold in 1986 In 1981, Wold returned to Caltech as an assistant professor in the Biology department. She was promoted to associate professor in 1988 and full professor in 1996, holding the position until 2002. She became Bren Professor of Molecular Biology as of 2003. Wold helped to found the L. K. Whittier Gene Expression Center at Caltech in 1999, with Stephen Quake and Mel Simon, collaborating with the Human Genome Project. She has also been involved in establishing the Center for Biological Circuit Design at Caltech. She has been an advisor to the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy in the area of genomics. Wold was director of the Beckman Institute at Caltech from 2001 to 2011, succeeding founding director Harry B. Gray. As of January 30, 2012, she was succeeded as director by David A. Tirrell.  Research  Barbara Wold has published more than sixty papers in the areas of developmental biology and genetics. Throughout her career, Wold has focused on exploring the architecture and logic of gene regulatory networks, in an effort to understand the mechanisms that drive cell state transitions in the development and differentiation of individual cells. In particular, she has investigated the ways in which these differentiation mechanisms are encoded in DNA, and furthermore, how they are executed via transcription. Beginning with undifferentiated precursor cells, Wold and her lab have focused particularly on transitions from mesodermal cells in early development to fully developed skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in animals, primarily through the use of mouse models. In addition, she is interested in the transitions in cell development which lead to tumorigenesis. Wold and her lab have used various techniques, including genome-wide and proteome-wide assays, wet-bench genomic technology, and computational methods, many of which they have developed in conjunction with other researchers, to study skeletal muscle development, degeneration and regeneration. She has also used such techniques as microarray gene expression analysis, global protein/DNA interaction measures, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and comparative genomics. In collaboration with others, her lab has also pioneered a modification of mass spectrometry and dual-affinity apitope tagging that enables efficient and accurate classification of multi-protein complexes. Much of Wold's recent work focuses on biological information processing, developing and using new techniques such as ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques to computationally model the inputs and outputs of gene networks. She studies embryonic development and regeneration in vertebrates, examining transcriptional networks and using comparative genomics to model mouse, human and dog genomes. This work is leading to increased understanding of direct transcriptional regulation and of post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms and their mediation by microRNAs. Wold's goal is a deep understanding of biological circuit design and the mechanisms of genetics and cell development. To this end, Wold seeks to use her research to contribute to the development of the international reference transcriptome and regulatory element databases. Wold's lab has recently been concerned with human disease genomics. In particular, they are looking into diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and musculoskeletal disorders.

Early life De Laittre was born in 1832 to Charles De Laittre and Rosalie Levalle Desisles. As a child he helped with work on the family farm and attended local schools. After turning 18, he worked for several years on fishing boats operating in the Bay of Fundy and Straits of Belle Isle. In 1852, he decided to move to California, arriving in San Francisco, California later that year and making his way to Murphys, California to prospect for gold with an old friend. While the two were unsuccessful in mining for gold, De Laittre became involved in a profitable mill which supplied lumber to the area's miners and also invested in other local businesses. In May 1860, he returned home to visit his mother who was in poor health. After her death in October 1860, he returned to California after a brief stop in Conway, New Hampshire to deliver some letters on behalf of friends. While visiting there he became engaged to Clara Eastman and promised he would settle his affairs in California and return within 6 months. Soon after he returned to California the American Civil War began, delaying his return until after the war had ended. The two were married in July 1865 at the William K. Eastman House and, after briefly visiting Boston and New York, the two decided to set out for Minneapolis, Minnesota to connect with Clara's brother who had moved there previously. Minneapolis After arriving in Minneapolis, De Laittre became involved in the milling industry (with his now brother-in-law William Wallace Eastman) and became a partner in the North Star Woolen Mill. He later formed several companies in the lumber industry. In 1877 he ran for mayor of Minneapolis as a Republican, defeating incumbent A. A. Ames. While he was pushed to run for a second term, De Laittre declined as his business interests had suffered from his inattention while he was in office. De Laittre was later named State Prison Inspector from 1879 to 1887. He was involved with the development and construction of Minneapolis City Hall and the Minnesota State Capitol buildings. He also remained part of the local business world, working with the Nicollet National Bank and the Farmers & Mechanics Savings Bank. De Laittre died in 1912.

Preventive control systems emphasize prevention of hazards before they occur rather than their detection after they occur. The FDA released the rules in the Federal Register from September 2015 onwards. The first release of rules addressed Preventive Controls for Human Food and Preventive Controls for Foods for Animals. The Produce Safety Final Rule, the Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) Final Rule and the Accredited Third-Party Certification Final Rule were issued on November 13, 2015. The Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food final rule was issued on April 6, 2016, and the Mitigation Strategies To Protect Food Against Intentional Adulteration (Food Defense) final rule was issued on May 27, 2016. Scope All food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, must have a written FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plan in place by the deadlines listed below: *Very small businesses of less than $1 million in sales per year are exempt, but must provide proof to the FDA of their very small status by January 1, 2016. *Businesses subject to Juice HACCP () and Seafood HACCP () are exempt. *Businesses subject to the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance; Sept 17, 2018. *Small businesses, defined as having fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees; Sept 17, 2017. *All other businesses; Sept 17, 2016. Additionally, for the first time food safety is being extended to pet food and animal feed, with firms being given an extra year to implement Current Good Manufacturing Practices before a Preventive Controls system the following year: *Primary Production Farms, defined as \\"an operation under one management in one general, but not necessarily contiguous, location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities\\" are exempt. *Very small businesses of less than $2,500,000 in sales per year; Sept 17, 2018 for cGMP, Sept 17, 2019 for Preventive Controls, but must provide proof of very small business status by January 1, 2017. *Small businesses, having fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees; Sept 17, 2017 for cGMP, Sept 17, 2018 for Preventive Controls. *All other businesses; Sept 17, 2016 for cGMP, Sept 17, 2017 for Preventive Controls. The FDA estimates that 73,000 businesses currently fall under these definitions. Differences between FSMA Preventive Controls and HACCP *FSMA places a much stronger emphasis on science, research and prior experience with outbreaks than HACCP. For example, the FDA now uses whole genome sequencing to match the exact strain of pathogen isolated from hospital patients to DNA recovered from food manufacturing facilities. *FSMA requires that a \\"Preventive Controls Qualified Individual\\" (PCQI) with training and experience oversee the plan. HACCP assigned responsibilities to a team drawn from management. *FSMA requires that firms vet (\\"Verify\\") all their suppliers for the effectiveness of their food safety programs. This has the effect of drafting companies into the FSMA enforcement effort, since the Supplier Verification and Foreign Supplier Verification programs require that the suppliers provide written proof that they have Prerequisite Programs, and Preventive Controls systems which include their own supplier vetting program. *FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plans rely on Prerequisite Programs such as GMPs, allergen controls, Integrated Pest Management and vetting suppliers far more than HACCP plans, since these programs tend to be preventive. *FSMA-compliant Hazard Analyses address radiological hazards in addition to the chemical, biological and physical hazards covered by HACCP systems. *FSMA explicitly requires a Food Defense component, with both terrorism and Economically Motivated Adulteration addressed. Businesses with less than $10,000,000 a year in sales are exempt. *FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plans de-emphasize Critical Control Points in favor of Preventive Controls. Preventive Controls do not require specific Critical Limits. *FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plans allow Corrections in place of Corrective Actions when the public health is not threatened. Corrections are not as strict regarding paperwork as Corrective Actions. The FDA believes that companies might have been avoiding making minor improvements because they felt that the paper trail of a Corrective Action would open them to legal risk due to discovery during investigations or lawsuits. *FSMA-compliant Food Safety Plans are to be reviewed once every three years, as opposed to yearly with HACCP.

History =Los Angeles Area Council= Founded in 1915,Boy Scouts of America, Los Angeles Area Council the Los Angeles Area Council (LAAC) (#033) served most of the City of Los Angeles as well as several other cities in the greater Los Angeles area. It was one of five Boy Scouts of America councils in Los Angeles County, California. Since its founding in 1915, the Los Angeles Area Council served millions of youth, 54,567 youth in 2008. The Los Angeles Area Council was founded in 1915 as the Centinela Council, changing its name in 1925 to the Los Angeles Council. In 1934 the San Antonio District (#046), founded in 1922; and the South Pasadena Council (#067), founded in 1927 merged into the LAC, with the name of the organization changing to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area Council. The council name changed to LAAC in 1945. The LAAC was one of the first councils organized in the United States and is one of the largest councils still in existence. =San Gabriel Valley Council= Located in Los Angeles County, California's San Gabriel Valley, the Boy Scouts of America's San Gabriel Valley Council (#40) was one of five councils serving Los Angeles County, headquartered in Pasadena. With the founding of the BSA in 1910, the first goal of the San Gabriel Valley Scout leaders was to organize as new troops. Paid professionals, many of whom were YMCA leaders, were recruited to help start new Troops and spread the new Scouting program. They were sent out into the San Gabriel Valley towns to organize new troops and recruit leaders. By March 1919, there were nine active troops with 190 boys in the San Gabriel Valley. The Pasadena Council (also known as the Pasadena District Council) of the Boy Scouts of America was organized March 3, 1919, with jurisdiction over Pasadena, Altadena and Lamanda Park.sgvcbsa.org, San Gabriel Valley Council A charter was granted by the BSA National Headquarters dated April 1, 1919 to the Pasadena District Council. Tallman Trask was hired to be the first Scout Executive. Trask had been a District Executive for the Los Angeles Council. He had also served as Los Angeles' Camp Director. Prior to joining the BSA, Trask was an executive for the YMCA and had run several camps for them. By October 1, 1919, there were 15 active troops with 299 Scouts.

In 2015 the Project began an endeavour to place relays and, particularly, exit nodes of the Tor anonymity network in public libraries. Tor Exit Relay Project Its pilot project enabled the Kilton Public Library in Lebanon, New Hampshire to become in July 2015 the first library in the United States to host Tor, running a middle relay on its excess bandwidth. This service was put on hold in early September, however, when the library was visited by the local police department after they had received a \\"heads up\\" e-mail from Department of Homeland Security highlighting the criminal uses of the Tor network (and which falsely claimed that this was the network's primary usage), whereupon the library began reconsidering the deployment from a public relations perspective. After an outpouring of support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Massachusetts and New Hampshire affiliates of the ACLU, the Tor Project itself, an editorial in the local paper Valley News strongly in favor of the pilot project, and virtually unanimous public testimony, the library board of trustees decided on 15 September 2015 to renew the anonymity service, letting stand its previous unanimous vote to establish the middle relay. A dozen libraries and their supporters nationwide expressed interest hosting their own nodes after the DHS involvement became public (an example of the Streisand effect), and U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif) released a letter on 10 December 2015, in which she asked the DHS to clarify its procedures, stating that ‚ÄúWhile the Kilton Public Library‚Äôs board ultimately voted to restore their Tor relay, I am no less disturbed by the possibility that DHS employers are pressuring or persuading public and private entities to discontinue or degrade services that protect the privacy and anonymity of U.S. citizens.‚Äù In March 2016, New Hampshire state representative Keith Ammon introduced a billhttp://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?id=796&txtFormat;=html allowing public libraries to run privacy software such as Tor which specifically referenced Tor itself. The bill was crafted with extensive input from Library Freedom director Alison Macrina, and was the direct result of the Kilton Public Library imbroglio. The bill was passed by the House 268-62. Also in March 2016, the first Tor middle relay at a library in Canada was established, at the University of Western Ontario. Given that the running of a Tor exit node is an unsettled area of Canadian law, and that institutions are more capable than individuals to cope with legal pressures, Alison Macrina has opined that in some ways she would like to see intelligence agencies and law enforcement attempt to intervene in the event that an exit node were established. Also in March 2016, the Library Freedom Project was awarded the Free Software Foundation's 2015 Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit at MIT. As of 26 June 2016, the Kilton Library is the only library in the U.S. running a Tor exit node. However, in August of that same year, Kilton Library's IT Manager, Chuck McAndrew, said they still hoped other libraries would run their own, adding, \\"We always planned on our library simply being the pilot for a larger nationwide program. Like everything, this will take time. We continue to talk to other libraries, and the Library Freedom Project is actively working with a number of libraries that have an interest in participating.\\"  Workshops  The director of the Library Freedom Project, Alison Macrina, at unBound, the technology lab and maker space of the Meridian Library District in Idaho, shortly after giving a privacy workshop in January 2016. The logos are those of assorted privacy enhancing technologies, institutions and advocacy groups such as the Tor project, the Electronic Freedom Foundation, Privacy Badger and Noisebridge Working with ACLU affiliates across the United States, the Library Freedom Project provides workshops to educate librarians about \\"some of the major surveillance programs and authorizations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, PRISM, XKEYSCORE, and more, connecting the NSA‚Äôs dragnet with FBI and local police surveillance\\". They also discuss current and developing privacy law on both the federal and state levels, in addition to advising librarians how to handle issues like gag orders and National Security Letters. Other topics covered include Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET) that might help library patrons browse anonymously or evade online tracking. Furthermore, the project conducts training classes for library patrons themselves which focus on on-line security and privacy. The classes can be adjusted to accommodate any level of user, from beginner to advanced, and various security needs. Given that library patrons, including but not limited to domestic violence survivors, political activists, whistle blowers, journalists, and LGBT teens or adults in many communities, face various threat models, the gestalt of digital security is not a matter of one-size-fits-all. In this regard Alison Macrina has remarked at a library conference that \\" ‚ÄúDigital security isn‚Äôt about which tools you use; rather, it‚Äôs about understanding the threats you face and how you can counter those threats. To become more secure, you must determine what you need to protect, and whom you need to protect it from. Threats can change depending on where you‚Äôre located, what you‚Äôre doing, and whom you‚Äôre working with.‚Äù The Library Freedom Project is a member of the torservers.net network, an organization of nonprofits which specializes in the general establishment of exit nodes via workshops and donations.  Library Freedom Institute  Beginning in 2018, Library Freedom Project began offering the Library Freedom Institute as a joint partnership with New York University. The institute is \\"a free, privacy-focused... program for librarians to teach them the skills necessary to thrive as Privacy Advocates; from educating community members to influencing public policy.\\" The format of the Institute has changed slightly with each cohort, but lasts four to six months and features lecturers and discussions in the areas of technology, community building, media, activism, and education. Participants create capstone projects at the end of the course. Since its inception, the Library Freedom Institute has been supported by grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. As of July 2020, there have been four cohorts of Library Freedom Institute with over 100 graduates from the program. Funding  In January 2015 the Library Freedom Project received $244,700 in grant funding from the Knight Foundation, and in January 2016 $50,000 from the Rose Foundation's Consumer Privacy Rights Fund (the fiscal sponsor of that grant being the Miami Foundation). In August 2017 the Library Freedom Project was awarded a $249,504 grant from the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program to facilitate the use of practical privacy tools in libraries using a \\"training the trainers\\" model. 40 geographically dispersed Privacy Advocates are expected to be trained in a six month course. New York University (NYU) and the Library Freedom Project have since created a formal collaborative program funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services called Library Freedom Institute; its inaugural course began in June 2018.

It was released on 11 September 2015 by Parlophone and Warner Bros. Records and served as a sequel to Kylie and Garibay's first collaboration, Sleepwalker (2014). Produced by American producer Fernando Garibay and Italian disc jockey (DJ) Giorgio Moroder, the three-track EP was developed between February and August 2015, shortly after Kylie Minogue's departure from Parlophone and American-based management Roc Nation. Musically, it is influenced by electronica, ambient house, and, after Minogue's departure, reggae and dancehall. Its lyrical content completes a story arc that began in their previous EP, going from loss to recovery. Released with no prior announcement, Kylie and Garibay received positive reviews from most music critics. The majority of the reviews highlighted Minogue's return to mainstream dance music and complimented the production by Garibay and Moroder. The EP's lead track, \\"Black and White\\", received an accompanying music video directed by long-time friend and collaborator Katerina Jebb. Even though it was intended as a low-key underground project, the EP garnered acclaim in countries including Australia, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. As a surprise, the singer appeared at Moroder's Los Angeles gig to play and sing along to their track, \\"Your Body\\". Background and development Giorgio Moroder in 2015 In March 2014, Minogue released her twelfth studio album, Kiss Me Once. Receiving positive reviews and experiencing moderate commercial success, she subsequently commenced her Kiss Me Once Tour through Europe and Australia between September 2014 to March 2015. During the first leg of her tour, the singer featured a short film titled Sleepwalker, which was presented to the audience before the beginning of the show. Produced by Garibay, the short film's tracks were distributed on Minogue's SoundCloud channel on 26 September 2014; the recordings, which were dubbed \\"experimental\\", included \\"Glow\\", \\"Wait\\", \\"Break This Heartbreak\\", and \\"Chasing Ghosts\\". In January 2015, Italian DJ Giorgio Moroder confirmed a new musical project with Minogue and Garibay, revealing to American website Idolator that \\"She is doing another EP with [their] friend Fernando who did most of Lady Gaga's Born This Way.\\" He described the approach as \\"very sexy and uncommercial\\". A year after Kiss Me Once's release, Minogue's contract with Parlophone ended. Alongside this, she announced her departure from Roc Nation and planned \\"to take more control over her career\\". Minogue began negotiations with a number of major labels, ultimately signing to BMG Rights Management in December 2016. She licensed other projects from her own production company to previous label Parlophone Records and Warner Bros. Records in the interim period. In an interview with Billboard, Minogue commented about her working with Garibay: \\"It was a beautiful thing, because [they] did it in [their] own time [...] Whenever [she] was in L.A., [she] would drop by [Garibay's] home studio‚Äîwhich is a lovely place to be anyway‚Äîand really there was no pressure. It was just about expression and kind of mashing things up.\\" Jamaican artist Shaggy was first suggested by Garibay's manager Martin Kierszenbaum, who felt Shaggy and Minogue would be a workable duet as they had known each other prior to this project. Composition Shaggy (pictured in 2018) is featured on the song \\"Black and White\\". Kylie and Garibay was developed and recorded between February and August 2015. Originally, Minogue wanted to feature four recordings, but she narrowed it down to three for unknown reasons. Each track featured guest vocalists‚Äî\\"Black and White\\" featured vocals during the bridge and ending section by Shaggy; \\"If I Can't Have You\\" included vocals by Australian singer Sam Sparro; and the final track, \\"Your Body\\", included vocals and production by Giorgio Moroder. Apart from the second track, \\"Black and White\\" and \\"Your Body\\" were co-written and co-composed by Minogue. Likewise, Garibay produced the entire project with the help of Moroder on the latter song. Musically, Kylie and Garibay was influenced by electronic music whilst its lyrical content delved into love, enjoyment, and sex. Sam Sparro (pictured in 2012) provides vocals on \\"If I Can't Have You\\". According to Bradley Stern from MuuMuse, \\"The 3-track set is another forward-thinking, shape-shifting offering, each with a different feature and feel.\\" Stern described \\"Black and White\\" as a \\"beautiful and bizarre pop hybrid\\" and noted that it \\"set the tone\\" of the EP. With this statement, he compared the composition to that of American DJ and producer Kaskade. Mike Wass from Idolator commented that \\"the tone is very different this time\\", labeling it more \\"accessible\\" compared to Minogue and Garibay's \\"experimental\\" elements on tracks \\"Walk\\" and \\"Chasing Ghosts\\". Robbie Daw from Idolator found that the sound was reminiscent of Minogue's previous work. Lewis Corner from Digital Spy labeled the sound as \\"warm\\". Lyrically, the song delved into a broken relationship, where Minogue explained her sadness of looking at photographs of an ex-boyfriend. The next track, \\"If I Can't Have You\\", was a house composition that incorporated elements of tropical music. Sparro's vocals were \\"breathy falsetto\\" in comparison to his previous work. The final track, \\"Your Body\\", was noted by critics for Moroder's Italian introduction; Moroder stated that Minogue asked him if he \\"could do a little talk in Italian on her music. She wanted it really sexy, like a Latin lover ‚Äì heavy breathing.\\" Christina Lee from Idolator, who reviewed a live performance of the song, said it was \\"just as the electronic music trailblazer described: sexy, seductive and more ambient\\". Zoe Camp from Pitchfork Media compared the track's sound to the work of Swedish musician Robyn. Release and promotion Despite Minogue's contractual end with Parlophone Records in March 2015, Kylie and Garibay was licensed by Minogue's own production company on 11 September 2015 by the Parlophone label, alongside Warner Bros. Records, with no prior announcement. It was distributed on the iTunes Store and Spotify by Parlophone, featuring the three tracks. On her website, Minogue commented that she is \\"so happy to finally be able to share these songs with fans. And to have each track featuring such amazing and different artists ‚Äì Shaggy, Giorgio Moroder and Sam Sparro ‚Äì is a real thrill. Fernando really lives and breathes for music, and [they] had a lot of fun plotting to surprise fans with these songs.\\" The EP and a separate project called Kylie Christmas (also released in 2015) were the final projects that Minogue worked on with Parlophone and Warner Bros. Records to date, albeit with both releases remaining under Minogue's ownership and licensed to her old labels, which she still considered \\"family\\". Prior to the EP's release, Minogue, Garibay, and Moroder appeared at a musical gig in Los Angeles, California in February 2015. Moroder was the headlining act, and they collectively performed a live version of \\"Your Body\\". Subsequently, Minogue released the music video to \\"Black and White\\" on YouTube; it was directed by English artist and Minogue's long-term friend, Katerina Jebb, in order to promote the EP. The visuals were inspired by old film footage; the singer wanted to place herself in a vintage-oriented set-up. To achieve this, video editor Benjamin Ricart created \\"old grainy\\" and \\"damaged\\" overlaps. Noted by critics for its stripped-down appeal and a lack of \\"polished\\" looks, the video was compared to the visual work of American musician Lana Del Rey, whom was also noted for her use of vintage footage and editing. Reception Kylie and Garibay received positive reviews from most music critics. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse praised the EP's \\"mid-transition\\". Stern further noted musical and production similarities between the EP and Minogue's 1997 album Impossible Princess; he concluded \\"As it turns out, IndieKylie is alive and well. This is a very good thing.\\" Zoe Camp from Pitchfork Media highlighted \\"Your Body\\" as the EP's best entry, complimented Moroder's vocal inclusion, and commended the track's 1980s music influences. Billboard editor Keith Caulfield wrote, \\"When a megastar like Kylie Minogue drops new music out of the sky without warning, it‚Äôs a pop emergency of the best kind.\\" He reflected on the EP's release, commending the production and inclusions of Shaggy, Giorgio Moroder, and Minogue's vocals. As a low-key, experimental project, Kylie and Garibay was not expected to be commercially successful. However, the EP and its three songs appeared on iTunes charts in countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Spain.

Life Towards the end of the First World War, his father, pharmacology researcher and physician, sent him to the Black Forest to a farmer so he could obtain food in exchange for manual labor. In 1942, under the direction of Robert Oppenheimer, Peters completed his doctorate in physics. During his time at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory Peters was active in the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians, a labor union affiliated to the Congress of Industrial Organizations. In J Robert Oppenheimer's 1949 House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Peters was accused of being a communist sympathizer, a \\"crazy person\\" and \\"quite a red\\" by Oppenheimer. The Rochester Times-Union broke the story a few days later, and Peters soon realized that his academic career in the US was affected. Peters could not find work in the United States. In 1951, he left the country to Mumbai, India, where he continued to study cosmic rays for eight years. Over the next four decades, he directed several studies on cosmic rays.

He wielded massive popularity among the local populace through social media presence, and helped in conveying a more youth- oriented image of militancy in Kashmir, recruiting numerous foot-soldiers to the cause. Burhan Wani was actively sought after by Indian security forces with a hefty bounty being imposed on his head, and was finally killed on 8 July 2016 in a shootout. The killing sparked massive protests across the Kashmir Valley in what became the worst span of unrest in the region since 2010. As a result, Kashmir was placed under 53 consecutive days of curfew, which was only fully lifted on 31 August 2016. In entirety, the protests resulted in the deaths of more than 96 people and injuries to over 15,000 civilians and 4,000 security personnel.  Biography  Burhan Wani was born in Dadsara village of Tral area in Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir to Muzaffar Ahmad Wani, principal of a government higher secondary school and Maimoona Muzaffar, a postgraduate of science who taught Quran in her village. He had four siblings, including his elder brother Khalid Muzaffar Wani, sister Iram Muzaffar and two younger brothers, one of whom is Naveed Alam. TraI has been a perpetual hot-bed of hardliner separatist insurgency. Burhan Wani planned to be a doctor and had obtained more than 90% marks in his Class 8 exam but left his home on 16 October 2010, ten days before his secondary exam and enrolled for the militant cause at about an age of 15, joining Hizbul Mujahideen. His family claims that the root of his disillusion with Indian state apparatus laid in an incident in the last summer, whence state police allegedly beat him up, along with his brother Khalid and a friend for no fault of theirs, after asking them to purchase cigarettes for them. Burhan's cousins were already involved with the militant movement since about 2008, and had joined Hizbul Mujahideen in 2010. Burhan Wani used social-media as a tool of potent information-warfare leveraging \\"a clever mix of ideology, religion and a deep sense of persecution\\" in chaste Kashmiri to romanticize the militant movement and wielded unforeseen influence in the local populace as a poster- boy, attracting numerous young adults into the cause. He oft-elaborated about the idea of India being entirely incompatible with Islam thus mandating a destruction at any cost, and aimed of unfurling the flag of Islam on Delhi's Red Fort. In 2013 Burhan's notability as a mujahid was further boosted, after he was erroneously described as being killed, across social media. There was a remarkable increase in the anti-India rhetoric of Burhan's speeches, after his brother Khalid was killed by the Indian Army on 13 April 2015 when he went to meet him (Burhan), along with three friends. The army claimed that Khalid was a militant sympathizer who had taken his friends to get them recruited and was subsequently killed in an encounter. The family of Khalid however alleged that he died in custody, claiming that his body showed no bullet wounds but clinical signs of physical torture. The three friends of Khalid meanwhile escaped but ran into an army cordon, where they alleged being tortured before being rescued by the state police. In August 2015, the state government imposed a bounty of ‚Çπ1 million on Burhan's head. A Facebook post about a month back showing Burhan along with 10 other militants in militant attire with heavy arms had gone viral in Kashmir. The videos however continued, with him urging people to take up arms against the state and refusing to collaborate with Indian elements. Police have often approached the judiciary, for enacting bans on social networking pages that disseminated Burhan's messages. In a video released in June 2016, he assured the Amarnath pilgrims of a safe passage but had threatened to attack proposed resettlement colonies for Kashmiri Pandits, in opposition to an Israel-like solution, and colonies for armed forces. He also urged the state-police to stay out of their way, threatening to attack all security forces. Although no attack has ever been traced back to him, he is believed to have masterminded several of them.  Death  Burhan Wani was killed in an anti insurgency operation on 8 July 2016 along with two other militants, later identified as Sartaj Ahmad Sheikh and Pervaiz Ahmad Lashkari. He and his companions were killed in Bumdoora village in Kokernag area by a joint team of the special operations group of the Jammu and Kashmir Police and 19 Rashtriya Rifles. Security forces later stated that the operation had actually begun on 7 June when Burhan, along with his companions, had come to Kokernag in order to procure weapons. Some army and police officials later said that the security forces had received intelligence regarding the presence of Sheikh but did not know Wani too was present along with him. The state's Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and the Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Kumar Singh also stated that the security forces were unaware of his presence and would have given him a chance had they known about his presence there. According to police officials, the security forces faced resistance from locals who resorted to stone-pelting. The encounter began at 4:30 p.m. and ended at 6:15 p.m. The militants were hiding in a house during the operation and started firing on the troops conducting search operations. All three were killed in the ensuing encounter. Jammu and Kashmir Police's Director General K. Rajendra confirmed that Wani was killed in an exchange of fire between security personnel and the militants. The local residents denied awareness of Wani's presence in the village. According to them, the police arrived around noon and said that they were combing the area in preparation for an inauguration by the Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. They cordoned off the area by 4 p.m. and took positions around the house where Burhan and his associates were present. When the militants tried to come out and escape, they were shot down. After their death, hundreds of villagers came out mourning the death and clashed with the police, CRPF and attacked army camps in the area.A journey into the heart of Kashmir's crisis, Al Jazeera, 15 July 2016. He is believed to have been succeeded by Sabzar Bhat.  Reaction  A large crowd attended his funeral on 9 July. The crowd was estimated to number 200,000 and was described by reporters as the largest ever gathering. The last rite prayers were also performed in absentia in all major towns of Kashmir. His body wrapped in the flag of Pakistan was buried next to that of his brother Khalid in Tral. Militants were also present at his funeral and offered him a three-volley salute. After the news of his death spread, violent protests erupted in some areas of Kashmir Valley. Separatist leaders called for shutdown in Kashmir which was repeatedly extended before being called off in February 2017. Police stations and security forces were attacked by mobs. Stone pelting was reported from many parts in Kashmir, including upon transit camps of Kashmiri Pandits. Internet services along with train services were suspended and the national highway was shut down. The Amarnath pilgrimage was repeatedly resumed and suspended due to the unrest. More than 200 Kashmiri Pandit employees fled the transit camps during night time on 12 July due to the attacks by protesters on the camps. The house where Burhan was killed was set ablaze by a mob on suspicion that its residents had tipped-off the security forces about Burhan. Curfew was imposed in all districts of Kashmir on 15 July and mobile phone networks were suspended. The curfew was lifted from all parts on 31 August 2016. More than 90 people died in the unrest and over 15,000 civilians were injured. Indian security forces reportedly used assault rifles to open fire on protestors. Over 4,000 security personnel were also injured during the unrest. Peoples Democratic Party leader Muzaffar Hussain Baig alleged that the standard operating procedure had not been followed during the encounter involving Wani and his accomplices. Baig demanded that a commission be appointed to probe Wani's killing. Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh refused, stating that it was an anti-terrorist operation and there was no need for an inquiry. A day after Wani's death former Chief Minister of state Omar Abdullah said that his killing had made him the new icon of the disaffected section of the Kashmiri society and further warned that more Kashmiris will join the militancy after his death. On 12 July, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a statement expressed \\"shock\\" over the killing of Burhan Wani which was criticised by the Indian government. Sharif called Wani a \\"martyr\\" on 15 July. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs in response criticized Pakistan for \\"glorifying\\" terrorists belonging to proscribed terrorist organisations. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised the media alleging it was portraying the slain Wani as a hero. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations Maleeha Lodhi during meeting with UN officials raised the killing of Wani describing it as an \\"assassination of a Kashmiri youth leader\\". During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September, Sharif described Burhan Wani as a \\"young leader\\" who had emerged as a symbol of the latest \\"Kashmiri Intifada\\". His family was allowed to be given ex-gratia compensation of Rs. 4 lakh by the Jammu and Kashmir government in December 2016 for the controversial killing of his older brother Khalid. This led to protest by opposition parties as well as Bharatiya Janta Party. Chief Minister Mufti denied on 18 January 2017 that any compensation has been paid.  Legacy  In July 2017, Pakistan Today praised Wani and compared his death to the death of Che Guevara, citing \\"History repeats itself\\". On the Pakistani independence day in August 2017, Wani was featured on a special train named Azadi Train which was organised by Pakistan Railways in the memory of country's national heroes. He became the face of Kashmir independence movement, and was also compared with Bhagat Singh. Burhan Wani had released a group photo on 1 July 2015 of himself seated with 10 other militants, all armed and dressed in army fatigues, which went viral. The militants in the photo included Sabzar Ahmad Bhat, Waseem Malla, Naseer Ahmad Pandit, Ishfaq Hameed, Tariq Ahmad Pandit, Afaaquallah Bhat, Adil Ahmad Khanday, Saddam Padder, Waseem Ahmad Shah and Anees. All of the militants in the photograph have been killed apart from Tariq who surrendered, in May 2016.

Set in modern-day Afghanistan, it is told through the point of view of Aziz, a young boy who must join the \\"Special Lashkar\\" ‚Äì a U.S. funded militia ‚Äì in order to save his injured brother. Dr. Truman Anderson has called Green on Blue a \\"morally complex debut novel\\" for how Ackerman explores the themes of loyalty to family and nation, revenge, and the brutality of war throughout the novel.  Plot  The novel opens with Aziz, the protagonist, and his older brother Ali in their home in a remote village in southeastern Afghanistan. Despite their village's isolation among the mountains, the boys have a stable and loving home with their mother and father. The two boys are still quite young when their parents are killed in a raid. Newly orphaned, Aziz and Ali travel to Orgun, a city where they eke out a living at first by begging and later by working in a marketplace. Political events in Afghanistan shape Aziz's narrative in ways that he does not fully understand until later in the novel. At the same time that Ali is working in the market to pay for Aziz's education, the U.S. forces invade Afghanistan. Local militants and warlords strike back against the Americans, and a bomb explodes in the market in which Ali works, leaving him critically injured. In the hospital caring for his brother, Aziz encounters an Afghan wearing an American uniform. This man recruits Aziz to the U.S.-funded militia called the \\"Special Lashkar\\" because the wages from soldiering will allow Ali to stay in the hospital and receive the medical care he needs. Aziz departs for the border with the militia and quickly learns about the true nature of war. Through fighting with the Special Lashkar, he develops relationships with people who represent the different directions in which Aziz feels himself pulled. Mr. Jack, an American adviser for the Special Lashkar, is the only American in the novel. Aziz views Mr. Jack with a certain amount of skepticism, and sees the American as an outsider. Aziz also meets the warlord Atal, and is drawn to the man's power as well as Atal's niece, a young woman Aziz comes to fall in love. As he rises in the ranks of the militia, Aziz's loyalties are tested by his desire for revenge and his need to protect those he cares for. His dilemma illuminates the complexity of war and the different reasons people take up arms and fight.  Major themes  = Pashtunwali = This Pashtun ethical code is a key to understanding Aziz's ambivalence regarding his involvement in the war. The concepts of badal, meaning revenge, and nang, meaning honor, drive the actions of many of the Afghan characters in the novel. Due to his sense of badal, Aziz feels compelled to take revenge on the warlord responsible for the bombing that injured his brother, as this is the only way that he can restore nang. Aziz struggles to balance the demands of Pashtunwali with a desire to break the cycle of vengeance. = The economy of war = Aziz's fictional experiences show how often individuals go to war for reasons other than fighting for a national cause. For Aziz and other Afghan characters in Green on Blue, fighting in the Special Lashkar is a source of much-needed income. For others, fighting becomes a way to fulfill their own desire for revenge on an enemy. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Ackerman notes that \\"the reasons they were fighting were not particularly ideological...the reason why these folks are fighting is they're caught up in cycles of violence, and cycles of need.\\" Green on Blue highlights the complicated and diverse motives surrounding why people go to war and the often self-serving reasons why war continues.  Reception  Many critics have praised Ackerman's choice to write from the perspective of an Afghan narrator, challenging many American assumptions about the war in Afghanistan. In her article for Vogue, Megan O'Grady writes: \\"[Ackerman's] first novel is a standout both for its setting‚Äîremote Shkin firebase, a kind of twenty-first century Guadalcanal‚Äîand for the austere grace of its prose. But what sets the novel apart in the annals of American war literature is its daring shift in perspective\\". In addition to the narrative choice, Ackerman has been congratulated for inhabiting and portraying a foreign voice with accuracy and impartiality. Khaled Hosseini, who read Ackerman's manuscript early on in the publication stages stated: \\"[Ackerman's] most impressive feat is the creation of a convincing and credible world through his full immersion in Afghan culture.\\" In his review for the New York Times, Tom Bissell praised this cultural understanding as well, writing: \\"Elliot Ackerman has done something brave as a writer and even braver as a soldier: He has touched, for real, the culture and soul of his enemy.\\" Bissell also compared Ackerman's writing to that of Ernest Hemingway for Ackerman's \\"skilled, unadorned prose about men and women of action\\" as well as the book's insight into the \\"notions of honor and manhood.\\" In The Dallas Morning News, Chris Vognar described Green on Blue and Phil Klay's Redeployment as \\"carrying the sting of authenticity and the sensory expression of experiences lived.\\" References Category:2015 American novels Category:Novels set in Afghanistan Category:War novels Category:Novels set during the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) ","title":"Green on Blue"},{"id":"47779770","text":"Achena Atithi may refer to: * Achena Atithi (1973 film), a 1973 Bengali film * Achena Atithi (1997 film), a 1997 Bengali film ","title":"Achena Atithi"},{"id":"47779781","text":"Braehead Park, originally known as Hibernian Park, was a football ground in the Oatlands area of Glasgow, Scotland.

Early life Franklin Pierce Lamson was born April 19, 1851 in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts. His parents Joseph Sanborn and Eunice Ellen (Winslow) Lamson died when he was 3 years old and he was adopted by the Virgil Scribner family near Manchester, Maine. He received preparatory education at Hebron Academy, Kents Hill School, and Coburn Classical Institute and graduated from Maine State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1873. Career Lamson-Scribner taught botany in Maine high schools, before becoming an officer with Girard College in 1877. He was the botanist for the Northern Transcontinental Survey and completed an inventory of grasses and forages in Montana in the summer of 1883. In May 1885, he was appointed as an assistant in the USDA Division of Botany. His role was to study parasitic fungi affecting crops and he became the chief of the USDA Section of Mycology in 1886. Initial efforts focused on the control of downy mildew and black rot in grapes. Working with farmers he was able to try different disease control formulations and collect statistical data related to plant infection. In 1887, he established USDA stations for controlled experiments with farm owners as special agents. The section was also renamed to the Section of Vegetable Pathology.

Inspired by David Livingstone she trained to become a physician and missionary. Prejudice led her to leave Livingstone's footsteps and to work with the poor in South Africa. Life Waterston was born in Inverness in 1843. Her father ran the Caledonian Bank in Inverness. She was a Scottish teacher who was given the job of the first Superintendent of a new girl's section at the Lovedale Missionary Institute in South Africa. She arrived in South Africa in January 1867 to work for Dr James Stewart who led the mission. The Lovedale Girls' Institution opened on 23 August 1868. Waterston was the first woman physician in southern Africa. She worked there until 1873 when she returned to undertake the difficult task of obtaining medical training in England. Waterston was inspired by David Livingstone's death and the news that women were being allowed to become physicians. She was fortunate to be one of the first women to be trained at the London School of Medicine for Women where she took her medical degree in 1880. She received a medical license from the Irish King and Queen's College of Physicians. After training she went to the Livingstonia Free Church mission which at the time was at Cape Maclear on the shores of Lake Malawi. Lovedale was disillusioned when she saw the poor regard that the missionaries there had for the Africans and for her‚Äîthe male missionaries accused of her coming to the mission to find a husband. Realising that she was not achieving her potential she left. In 1880 she was back to the Lovedale mission for three years before she became a physician in Cape Town. She went into private practice, lived in part as a socialite, and was able to send money back to Scotland where her own family were unemployed, following the failure of the Caledonian bank in 1878. Waterston and her students, date unknown Waterston worked with the poor and established a \\"Ladies Branch of the Free Dispensary\\". It was known as \\"free expenses\\", but a small charge was always made to ensure the recipients' dignity. Waterston also insisted that the mothers who benefited should be married even though the child might have been born before the marriage. The organisation looked after mothers and also trained midwives to continue the work. In Bloemfontein she was part of a six- member committee appointed by the British Minister of War to investigate conditions in the concentration camps (other members of the committee included the suffragist Millicent Fawcett and Canadian physician Ella Campbell Scarlett). For her tireless work, Waterston was given the South African name of Noqataka, \\"the mother of activity\\". In 1925 she became the second woman to be made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. In 1929 Waterston was made a Doctor of Laws by the University of Cape Town. Waterston died in Cape Town in 1932. Legacy Waterston had written to James Stewart who led the institution in Lovedale in 1866. Her correspondence with Stewart continued until 1905.

Early life  Bane Jelic was born in Belgrade, Serbia. From early age he was attracted to musical instruments and music. At the age of ten he started to play the acoustic guitar and for his twelfth birthday he received an electrical guitar and an amplifier. According to his own words, he spent many hours practicing his guitar skills. Most of the time he practiced on average ten hours every day.  Music career  When Bane was only 12 years old, he created his first musical band, The Flying Cans, with his friends. The band played both Yugoslav and foreign songs. Next year, in 1980, he joined a heavy metal band Apocalypse, and performed in 1981 alongside much older musicians at a large venue in Belgrade's Ta≈°majdan pool. The master of ceremonies was the famous Vladimir Jankoviƒá D≈æet. The concert was broadcast live by the radio station \\"Beograd 202\\". During this event the fourteen years old Bane gave his first interview from the stage. Bane started his professional career with Magiƒçno oko band in 1984. The band had several tours across Yugoslavia, made a number of concerts and appearances on radio and TV, and was featured in many magazine articles and commercials. When Yugoslavia took part in Live Aid in 1985, organizing a venue on Belgrade's Red Star soccer club stadium, Magiƒçno oko opened the concert. Jeliƒá in 1990. In 1987 Bane went to serve the mandatory military service. He soon becomes the leader of a military band and in this capacity spends the entire service time playing with the band in a military centre (Dom JNA). Later Bane joined Peƒëa The Boys Band, and composed most of the music, and wrote most of the lyrics for their third album in 1987. In 1989, Bane joined Viktorija band, and spent the next three and a half years playing with them, composing the music and the lyrics for some of their most successful hits ‚Äì \\"Rat i mir\\" and \\"Od Splita do Beograda\\". At that time, Viktorija was one of the most famous and most popular bands in Yugoslavia. In 1993, alongside Milan and Vladan ƒêurƒëeviƒá, and ƒåeda Macura Bane founded Neverne Bebe. During that period, Neverne bebe recorded an album for Take it or Leave it Records. As he likes to say, this was the best band he ever played in, and one of the best periods in his life. At the same time, Bane started working on an instrumental album called Universe, that was published by PGP- RTS as a limited edition, only in 2002. In 1999, Bane joined Osvajaƒçi (The Conquerors), where he participated in two of the band's albums, and performed throughout Serbia and Montenegro and Europe. Since 2002 Bane is endorsed Ibanez guitars. In 2003 Bane enters the studio once again and creates a new instrumental album East-West. Music is arranged, produced, mixed and mastered by Bane Jelic. This album was published in 2015. In 2004 Bane released the album called \\"The Ultra Extreme\\". This material was in the making from 1984 till 1994, and was recorded on a standard tape recorder at home, from the first hand without repetition or overplay. This material is interesting because it shows how he played at different points in time, from the age of sixteen onwards. The album includes cover versions of Niccolo Paganini‚Äôs 5th, 11th and 16th caprices, Moto Perpetuo, as well as Rimsky-Korsakov‚Äôs \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\". Bane also composed his own two caprices ‚Äì \\"La ruota della vita\\", which was played in staccato technique and \\"La fuga del salmone\\" in arpegio technique. Bane plays also Joe Satriani's caprice \\"Power Cosmic\\" but in a much faster technique than the original one. Bane expresses through his improvisations different solo playing technique in an amazingly fast tempo that explains the name of this album. The ultra extreme refers to the extremely fast, yet clear playing technique. Jeliƒá jamming with Steve Vai in Belgrade during November 2005. During his Real Illusions Tour in 2005, Steve Vai performed in Belgrade's SKC and invited Bane Jeliƒá to be a guest artist.

In 2007, Bane published his progressive pop-rock album Srce zmaja (Dragon's heart), writing the music and lyrics, and performing both the instrumental and vocal sections on the album.

The Fain Family Not much of the Fain family's early history in Mossy Creek is known, but it is apparent that a substantial portion of the family lived there prior to the Civil War. During the Civil War, many of the members of the family served in the Confederate army. Colonel S.W. Fain, a local hero, returned to take over the cotton spinning factory. Colonel Richard Gammon Fain was the head of the Tennessee's 63rd Regiment, nicknamed Fain's Regiment, which was a collection of ten companies that fought battles at Drewry's Bluff, Chickamauga, and the Siege of Petersburg.

The trees in the foreground are cork oaks (Quercus suber), together with the remains of a cut wheat field. In second and third plan are vineyards (Vitis vinifera) and olive trees (Olea europea). Wheat, cork, olive oil and wine are the most publicized products of the Alentejo. Map of Alentejo, in Portugal (in light orange) The Alentejo ( , ) is a geographical, historical and cultural region of south central and southern Portugal. In Portuguese, its name means \\"beyond () the Tagus river\\" (Tejo). The Alentejo includes the regions of Alto Alentejo and Baixo Alentejo. It corresponds to the districts of Beja, √âvora, Portalegre and the Alentejo Litoral. The main cities are: √âvora, Beja, Sines, Serpa, Estremoz, Elvas and Portalegre. It has borders with Beira Baixa in the North, with Spain (Andalucia and Extremadura) in the east, with the Algarve in the South and with the Atlantic Ocean, Ribatejo and Estremadura in the West. The Alentejo is a region known for its traditional polyphonic singing groups, similar to those found in Tuscany, Corsica, and elsewhere.  History  The comarca of the Alentejo became the Alentejo Province, divided into upper (Alto Alentejo Province) and lower (Baixo Alentejo Province) designations. The modern NUTS statistical region, Alentejo Region, was expropriated from the medieval provinces and historical territories of Estremadura Province (specifically the 1936 portions of the Ribatejo). The term Entre-Tejo-e-Guadiana has become obsolete; it referred to roughly the same land area between the Tagus and the Guadiana rivers as part of the Kingdom of Portugal.  Geography  = Dimensions = The Alentejo's area extends to (29.6% of the country) and has a population of 537,556 (5.1% of the country). Excluding Ponte de Sor, its area is and its population 520,834. The population density of the Alentejo is .A typical landscape of the rural Alentejo region, with an undulating wheat field and a solitary suber oak = Topography = Topographically the countryside varies from the open rolling plains of the south of the Alentejo to the granite hills that border Spain in the northeast. To feed the water needs of this considerable area a number of public dams have been constructed, most notably the Alqueva Dam. The landscape is primarily one of soft rolling hills and plains, with conspicuous shrubs and the native cork oaks and holly/holm oaks, the established olive trees and grapevines, plus some large-scale toilet roll production of eucalyptus trees and some native trees. In the north, traditional economic activity may be more livestock-based as typified by cattle, sheep, and pig (both white and black) farming. To the south agriculture may be more predominant. The Alentejo experiences prolonged periods without rain, leaving the fields dried as a result Coastal Alentejo Castelo de Vide, Alentejo, Portugal = Biome = Parque Natural da Serra de S√£o Mamede, a Nature Park Area located to the east of Portalegre, includes medieval villages. In the south near M√©rtola there is another Nature Park Area named Parque Natural do Vale Guadiana. This is more sparsely inhabited than the former. To the west, the coastal strip that runs from the port of Sines down to Cape St. Vincent (this already in the Algarve) comprises the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park. = Climate = The climate of the region is typically warm to hot and dry for a large part of the year, with summer temperatures regularly reaching up to , while winters are relatively mild and wet. The climate is not uniform throughout the region though: mid-summer temperatures in coastal areas are usually much lower (often around ) than inland ones (which frequently hover around ). This much resembles the contrast between Casablanca and the Moroccan interior, where the presence of the nearby Atlantic Ocean gives rise to marked temperature differences between coastal and even nearby inland zones. Usually, the warmest temperatures can be found in the southernmost inland parts of the region, along the Guadiana valley between M√©rtola and Juromenha, particularly in the areas close to Moura. However, the hottest days tend to deviate from the usual pattern and will arise when the winds are east or southeast and very hot air with temperatures reaching or more at 850 mbar level (usually around 1500 m.a.s.l.) enter Iberia from Africa. If the winds are strong enough, the deep and low-lying valley of the Sado river, becomes extremely warm by European standards. Places like Alvalade do Sado and Alc√°cer do Sal and others below , can reach under extreme circumstances and in the summer is regularly reached each year despite the fact that they are relatively close to the coast. The highest temperature ever recorded in Portugal and in fact Europe (this century) was measured on 1 August 2003 in Amareleja and reached . Since the meteorological station is about above the nearby valley near Moura it is very likely that about was reached there but no measurements were taken. What is most impressive and unique in Europe was a stretch of no less than 17 consecutive days at Amareleja with a maximum temperature of or more (reaching an average over the period of ). This was only equaled over the same period in C√≥rdoba, Spain; although slightly lower over the same period at . Finally the average daytime maximum temperatures reach in July and August near Moura, in the Sado Valley (and other inland valleys away from the coast). Many parts, however, are above 200 or even 300 m which leads to clearly lower average temperatures also in summer. It is very likely that the Guadiana river valley away from the coast is the hottest on average in Europe along with the inland part of the Spanish Guadalquivir region, especially near C√≥rdoba. The extremes in this valley, however, are somewhat lower (most just above ). Portugal, including the Alentejo region, is affected by global warming and average temperatures are clearly on the rise. Some climate models indicate daytime average maximum temperatures nearing in the Guadiana river valley by 2100.  Education  By the acceptable standards of a developed country, the illiteracy rate in the region may still be surprisingly high among those older than 60, in contrast with the younger generations. The rate of coverage of pre-primary education is among the highest in the country. Institutions of higher education include: *Polytechnic Institute of Beja *Instituto Polit√©cnico de Portalegre *University of √âvora  Economy  The Roman Temple of √âvora. Tourism is playing an increasingly important role in the Alentejo economy The area is commonly known as the \\"bread basket\\" of Portugal, a region of vast open countryside with undulating plains and rich fertile soil. With very few exceptions all the major towns are mainly reliant on agriculture, livestock and forestry. There are several types of traditional cheeses, wines and smoked hams and sausages made in the Alentejo region, among others: Queijo Serpa, Queijo de √âvora and Queijo de Nisa (PDO cheeses); Vinho do Alentejo and Vinho do Redondo (wines); and presunto (smoked ham). Marble, cork, olive oil and mining industries are other important activities in the region and tourism is expected to still have growth potential. The Alqueva Dam is an important irrigation and hydroelectricity generation facility which supports a part of the Alentejo's economy. The region is the home of the world's most important area for the growing of cork. Cork-oak, known in Portugal as \\"sobreiro\\", has been grown commercially in the region for the past 300 years, with the areas between the trees typically given over to grazing, or on the more productive soils, to the growing of citrus fruit, vines or olives. As a consequence, a uniquely rich and varied ecosystem has developed. The bark of the cork-oak is still harvested by teams of men using locally made hand-axes. No mechanical method has yet been invented that will allow the harvest to be achieved as effectively. The stripping of the bark is performed only in midsummer, when the bark can be removed more easily. The cork-oak is the only tree known that will allow this regular stripping of bark without damage. The harvest of one mature tree provides sufficient bark to produce about 4,000 wine bottle corks. The industry provides employment for about 60,000 workers.BBC, \\"Natural World: Cork ‚Äì Forest in a Bottle\\", BBC2, broadcast 8.00 pm, Tuesday, 9 December 2008.

It is approximately long and flows through Tunkhannock Township and Overfield Township. The stream is not designated as an impaired waterbody. In its upper reaches, it flows through glacial drift, while in its lower reaches, it passes over a waterfall. Lakes in the stream's watershed include Flow Pond. A number of bridges have been constructed over Mill Run. A sawmill also used to be located on the stream. The stream's drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Mill Run looking downstream Mill Run begins in a lake between Middle Mountain and Osterhout Mountain in Tunkhannock Township. It flows in a southerly direction for several tenths of a mile before entering Flow Pond. From the southern end of the pond, it flows south-southwest past German Hill for several tenths of a mile before entering a valley between Osterhout Mountain and Greenwood Hill. Here, the stream turns west and flows alongside Pennsylvania Route 307 for several tenths of a mile, crossing it twice. It then turns south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 307, leaving its valley, crossing Pennsylvania Route 92, and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River at La Grange Island. Mill Run joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Geography and geology Mill Run looking downstream The elevation near the mouth of Mill Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The width of Mill Run at the outlet of Flow Pond is and its depth is . At the inlet of the pond, the stream is wide and deep. The upper reaches of the creek are relatively slow-moving. At the outflow of Flow Pond, the channel of Mill Run is clean and rocky. Upstream of the pond, the channel is clean and marshy. In its upper reaches, the stream flows over glacial drift in a buried valley. However, it cuts through the drift approximately upstream of its mouth. In the lower reaches of Mill Run, the stream flows over some cascades with a height of . In an 1887 book, these cascades were said to give the stream \\"splendid\\" water power.

The ground, opened in the Lourdes neighborhood on 30 May 1929, had an estimated capacity of 5,000 and was Atl√©tico's home until 1950. It remained largely unused by the first squad until its demolition in 1994, when a shopping mall was built on the site. History In its early days, Atl√©tico Mineiro first played its matches at the Municipal Park of Belo Horizonte, before moving in 1909 to a ground at Guajajaras Street, in downtown Belo Horizonte. Atl√©tico eventually received from the Belo Horizonte municipal government a property at Paraopeba Avenue (later Augusto de Lima Avenue), in which it built its first official home ground. Rival club Am√©rica had its first stadium across the street. Stadium opening in 1929 In 1925 Atl√©tico Mineiro reached an agreement with the municipality of Belo Horizonte to exchange the ground where its former stadium was located, at Paraopeba Avenue, to a new land in the Lourdes bairro. Three years later construction began, helped by state governor Ant√¥nio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada, and the stadium opened on 30 May 30, 1929, in a friendly against Corinthians won by Atl√©tico 4‚Äì2. The following year, the stadium was visited by then FIFA president Jules Rimet, who for the first time watched a night game, a 10‚Äì2 victory by Atl√©tico over Sport which marked the inauguration of the ground's floodlights. The stadium was responsible for a rise in the population and people circulation of the neighborhood. In the Ant√¥nio Carlos, Atl√©tico Mineiro won its first competition at national level, the 1937 Copa dos Campe√µes Estaduais, after defeating Esp√≠rito Santo's Rio Branco 5‚Äì1. The stadium was Atl√©tico's home from 1929 to 1950, when the larger Independ√™ncia was built in Belo Horizonte to host matches of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and the older and smaller stadium fell out of favor, the stands being used as youth academies sleeping quarters. The ground was sold to the Belo Horizonte municipality by the club in the 1960s to placate a financial crisis, and closed in 1969. After decades of legal disputes, property of the estate eventually returned to Atl√©tico Mineiro in 1991, which then leased it to a shopping mall, built on the site where the stadium once was and inaugurated in 1996.
