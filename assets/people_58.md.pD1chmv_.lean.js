Their estimated reign is placed in the 10th century BCE.Chase (2010), p. 221-222 Reign This dynasty was reportedly the second dynasty of the Kingdom of Israel, succeeding the House of Jeroboam. The eponymous dynasty founder was Baasha of Israel, son of Ahijah and member of the Tribe of Issachar. He rose to the throne as a usurper, after assassinating his predecessor Nadab of Israel. Baasha also killed all known descendants of the House of Jeroboam. He reportedly reigned for 24 years, and was succeeded by his son Elah. Elah reigned for 2 years, and was eventually assassinated by his successor Zimri. Zimri had served Elah, as the captain of his chariots. Elah was reportedly ambushed and killed while in a drunken stupor. Zimri reportedly managed to kill Elah's entire family and Elah's friends, following the orders of the prophet Jehu. Zimri had an ephemeral reign of 7 days. His reign was not widely recognized, and his opponents elected Omri as a rival king. Omri besieged Zimri's house, and Zimri committed suicide by setting his own palace on fire. The House of Baasha was then succeeded by a new dynasty, the Omrides. Analysis The Kingdom of Israel survived for about two centuries. During this period, the Books of Kings mention 9 occasions where the throne of the kingdom was captured by usurpers. Among these 9 usurpers, only Omri and Jehu managed to establish relatively stable and long-lived dynasties. Both the House of Jeroboam and the House of Baasha were only represented by two generations of kings, while 4 of the usurpers were succeeded by someone not related to them.Ishida (1977), p. 171-174 The Deuteronomist redactor of the Books of Kings considered the kings Nadab and Elah as legitimate heirs to the throne, as each of them succeeded their father on the throne. The language of the Deuteronomist instead stigmatizes each usurper, for the conspiracies which elevated them to the throne. The dynastic principle of succession seems to have been clearly understood. This explains why the usurpers had to eliminate the heirs of the previous dynasties, in an effort to solidify their own hold on the throne. Baasha seems to have orchestrated his coup d'√©tat at a time when the House of Jeroboam was relatively weak, following unsuccessful wars against Shishak and Abijah of Judah, and territorial losses. The fall of the House of Baasha seems to have been a consequence of their own military weakness, as it followed lost unsuccessful wars against Asa of Judah and Ben- Hadad I. In the narrative of the Books of Kings, new and inexperienced monarchs often had to face prospective usurpers in the early years of their reign. The successful usurpations represent cases where the legitimate king could not survive this power struggle. The short reigns of both Nadab and Elah are among these cases in the narrative. Most of the usurpers in the narrative of the Kings of Israel were depicted as military men. Zimri was a commander of the chariots, Omri and Jehu were both army commanders, and Pekah was another king's aide-de-camp. The military background of Baasha is not explicit in the text, though he reportedly killed Nadab within the king's own military camp. Which would indicate that Baasha was a soldier or officer in Nadab's army. These usurpers of military background were evidently able to mobilize military forces in support of their respective coups. Their perceived competence as war-leaders was likely their main qualification for the position of king, as leadership during war was among the main duties of an Israelite king.

The Schilderij Pand had been established in 1540. It was under the management of the Antwerp city government. It comprised 100 art stalls on the second floor of the bourse. It operated throughout the year in contrast to the art stalls at the periodical trade fairs.John Loughman, Book Reviews: Painting for the Market.

The term of the lease was three years and the rent was particularly high at 1,848 guilders per year. It was the highest annual rent ever paid for the lease.Peter Stabel, Bruno Blond√©, Anke Greve, International trade in the Low Countries (14th-16th centuries): merchants, organisation, infrastructure : proceedings of the international conference Ghent-Antwerp, 12th-13th January 1997, Garant, 2000, p. 208 The marching order of the Ottoman army Bartholomeus de Momper's business suffered terribly as a result of the Sack of Antwerp. On 4 November 1576, mutinying Spanish tercios of the Army of Flanders began the sack of Antwerp, leading to three days of horror among the population of the city, which was the cultural, economic and financial center of the Low Countries. Some 7,000 lives and a great deal of property were lost. The savagery of the sack led the provinces of the Low Countries to unite against the Spanish crown. The devastation also caused Antwerp's decline as the leading city in the region and paved the way for Amsterdam's rise. This rampage of Spanish soldiers in Antwerp caused significant financial loss to Bartholomeus de Momper. All his art stalls were sacked and his residence was plundered. As the tenant of the Schilderij Pand which he leased from the city government, Bartholomeus de Momper petitioned for a waiver of the rental payments on the ground that he was unable to operate his business for a while. The city magistrate only agreed to grant a waiver of the rental payment for half a year and instructed de Momper to ensure that his sub-lessees would return to operate their business in the Schilderij Pand. Bartholomeus de Momper resumed trade at seven art stalls in January 1577. Not long after, a new threat arose in Antwerp when German soldiers started to plunder the city and broke into the exchange where they pillaged all they could lay their hands on. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 de Momper had difficulty finding tenants for the stalls in the Schilderij Pand, but not because the art trade was in decline. The reason was that art dealers were running their trade on a lower floor of the bourse where they could display their paintings without having to rent the more expensive stalls in the Schilderij Pand from de Momper. Fun on the Ice in Mechelen Bartholomeus de Momper became deacon of the Guild of St Luke in 1581. In 1582, he entered into an agreement with Volcxken Diericx, a Flemish printmaker and publisher and the widow of Hieronymus Cock. Under the agreement Diericx would supply de Momper with loose and bound prints and maps from her stock for him to sell on her behalf for a commission. Among the works de Momper received from Dierix were 51 copies of two books of landscape prints, a genre apparently popular at the time.Alexandra Onuf, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe 'Small Landscape' Prints in Early Modern Netherlands‚Äô‚Äô, Routledge, 2017 Bartholomeus de Momper died in Antwerp between 1595 and 1597. Activity Bartholomeus de Momper trained as a painter and draughtsman and was also an engraver, but appears to have been mainly a publisher and dealer of prints.

The San Blas Islands, also known as the Guna Yala region, experienced an era of great political unrest during the early twentieth century, following the declaration of Independence by the Panamanian government in 1903. The Guna Yala region is situated between Colombia and Panama, and traditionally the Kuna Indians were able to cooperate with Colombia and live peacefully by their own laws and customs. Following Panama's declaration of independence, the new government attempted to control the Guna Yala region and its people, and impose a Westernised and \\"national\\" culture in its place. The laws introduced by the Panamanian government significantly influenced traditional Kuna customs and culture. The San Blas Rebellion consisted of multiple attempts made by the Kuna Indians to resist this control, and fight back against Panamanian authorities. Resistance against this power resulted in the Revolution of 1925, which resulted in 27 deaths, and initiated the peace agreement involving the United States that followed. This revolution is also known as 'La Revoluci√≥n Tule', or the Kuna Revolution, and was a direct consequence of the suppression introduced by the Panamanian government. The Kuna felt this was crucial for their ethnic survival as the laws implemented by the new Panamanian government directly impacted traditional Kuna education, dress and customs. The Revolution was planned by Kuna leaders and was backed by the U.S. government. It resulted in mediation and through negotiation peace was once again achieved. The Kuna were made to withdraw their declaration of independence and abide by the laws of the Panamanian government, so long as their terms were agreed upon and the Panamanian authorities did not threaten to eradicate Kuna traditions and customs. History of the Guna Yala Region  When the Spaniards arrived in the 1600s, the Kuna people were living here near the Gulf of Urab√°, in what is considered Colombia today. However, contact with the Spaniards resulted in significant violence and limited trade. The Kuna fled towards the Dari√©n region, what is considered Panama today. They initially began to live along the rivers which flowed into the Caribbean, however as early as the mid 1800s they began to relocate out onto islands near the mouths of freshwater rivers. This sheltered them from illnesses, snakes and mosquitos. Living on the islands also connected them to the coastal trade, forest products, coconuts and turtle-shell. It also gave the Kuna access to trade vessels travelling along coastal routes. They lived in this way on the islands, and maintained their farms on the mainland. Until the mid-nineteenth century this region remained relatively peaceful. Throughout the 19th Century the Kuna gave token allegiance to Colombia, and were left relatively alone. The region was divided, however, into two distinct factions, one that supported Panama and the other that supported Colombia.  Geography  The Guna Yala region, also known as the San Blas islands, is a region that consists of around 365 islands, of which 49 are inhabited, and consists of roughly 2.306 square kilometres. The region lies on the north coast of Panama, situated east of the Panama canal, but also nearby the border into Colombia. The region is situated conveniently near canal routes, and is a well known area for sailing. The islands however, are at risk of becoming uninhabitable by the late 21st century due to rising sea levels.  The Causes of the Rebellion  Republic of Panama flag = Panama gains independence 1903 = In 1903 Panama issued a declaration of independence from Colombia, with support from the U.S. government. At the time of their declaration of independence the San Blas islands were situated in a strategical location on the Colombian border. Realising the significance of this region, the Panamanian government began to incorporate it into the new nation by establishing administrative control of the area. = Panamanian intervention in San Blas = 1904 - A number of villages situated on the San Blas Islands were convinced to accept the Panamanian flag. 1906 - 17 students were removed from the region at the government's expense, and educated in the city. 1907 - A priest employed by the Panamanian government entered the region. This resulted in violent objections by the Kuna people which were quickly put to an end by his armed supporters. 1908 - The most respected village leader amongst the Kuna was given the title of Chief of the Atlantic Coast. 1909 - A police border was introduced, and a special frontier police force was implemented to guard the post. 1913 - Administration cut off all funds for the priest, and a Protestant missionary was introduced to the Island instead. 1915 - The Panamanian government established headquarters in the Western region of San Blas and implemented police outposts on several of the islands. 1917 - The Kuna who had been selected by the government and educated in the city had now returned home. Enlightened by their education, and supported by the frontier police, they began a program to introduce rapid cultural change in the hope to \\"progress\\" the region. 1919 - President Porras of Panama began to introduce controls to ensure the loyalty of the Kuna Indians. He begins by introducing a policy of forced assimilation. = Women's dress = There was a strong link between traditional dress and Kuna culture and identity, which made it a subject for control and change by the Panamanian government. As a fairly conservative society, the men typically wore dress shirts and trousers and the women wore traditional colourful dresses called tulemolas which were handmade. They also wore multicoloured bracelets known as winnis, which were beaded and believed to keep unwanted evil spirits away. From 1919 the government introduced bans which affected the wearing of some components of traditional woman's dress. The government introduced these laws to Westernise Kuna society and assert control. They stopped Kuna women from wearing their mola blouses, nose rings and leg and arm bindings, and forced them to wear Western style clothing. The Kuna greatly objected to the control on their cultural dress, and ethnic identity, and showed great strength in their reaction to the bans implemented by the government. For example, in 1925 for a three-year period following the revolution, women were required to once again adopt traditional dress as a form of rebellion against the government. Women on Narganaand other more progressive islands were forced to wear mola, even if they had never worn this traditional dress, and their noses had to be pierced by force.  Revolution  = Forces =  Richard Marsh  In 1925, the Kuna leaders planned and arranged a major revolt. The leaders were advised and supported by Richard Marsh. Marsh later wrote their declaration of independence. Marsh was an American explorer whom had initially gone to the Guna Yala region in the search of \\"White Indians\\", the lost ancestors of European heritage. During this trip he stumbled upon the Kuna and quickly found them to be likeable people. He also began to learn of the cultural attacks that were being implemented by the Panamanian government in this area and on the Kuna people. In order to raise awareness to this issue, he brought a legion of Kuna across to North America, which gained the attention of both Canada and the United States. Marsh soon returned to Panama and became a spokesman for the Kuna people despite his original intentions of his journey being in search of wealth. Marsh helped Kuna rebel leaders organise the rebellion in 1925 which attacked the Panamanian government. He also assisted in writing their declaration of independence which declared a new Kuna Republic.  Kuna Rebel Leaders  The main leaders involved in the revolt was the Chief of the island of Ustupu, who goes by the name Nele Kantule, and the Chief of the island of Ailigandi, who goes by the name Simral Colman. The motivation for the attacks were to revolt against the Panamanian police and government. They planned to do this by attacking the islands that were being most controlled by Panamanian officials. The Flag of the Revolution Guna, adopted in 1925 = About the Revolution = On February 12th, 1925, a conference was held in Aligandi, which lasted 26 days. It announced the Republic of Tule and implemented its territorial borders. A flag was created to symbolise this planned uprising - it was yellow with red stripes on the top and bottom, and a swastika in the middle. Together the Kuna leaders coordinated attacks on many of the islands that were being controlled by the Panamanian police and government. Marsh assisted in planning these attacks across the islands. They planned the attacks on the main islands whom had been carrying out the Panamanian government's policies which encouraged ethnocide, and implementing the most control on the Kuna people. The revolt began on February 22nd in 1925. It lasted three to four days and resulted in fewer than thirty deaths overall. = Lullabies = Lullabies played an essential role in the Kuna rebellion. Kuna society is fundamentally matriarchal, and lullaby singing is a key part of their culture. Lullabies are only sung by Kuna women to their children, and the messages conveyed in these lullabies were used to advise children about behaviour and common sharing. This made lullabies extremely influential in shaping the mindsets of Kuna children and society as a whole. During the Revolution, lullabies were used as a means to influence and brainwash children into defending their identity and culture. The children were told that they were the superior ethnic group, and that extinction of their culture and people would be disastrous and unrecoverable. These lullabies also had great religious significance as well during this time. They explained that the Kuna had been given a land in which they can live peacefully by their God, Paba Tummat, and in return they must protect this land from foreign intervention. These lullabies were used as a form of pop culture to influence the younger generation of Kuna to protect their culture and identity against the Panamanian government and Western influence.  Result  Through Marsh, the Kuna made an appeal to the United States. Marsh wanted support from the United States following his proclamation of independence. The government of Panama similarly wanted support from the United States government. They had only recently become a republic themselves, and were struggling without support from Colombia. This resulted in mediation between representatives of the US government, the Panamanian government and the Kuna leaders. A warship was sent by the Americans to the Gulf of San Blas, and the Panamanians and Kuna were invited to board the ship and dispute their situation. This mediation resulted in a US-backed agreement for the Kuna Indians of San Blas to remain independent and isolated from Panama, and to be self-governing. The agreement stated that so long as hostilities would end, the Kuna would be able to live as they had before, and that by the end of World War II the entire region of Guna Yala would be under Kuna control. The official peace agreement was signed on March the 4th, by the American minister, John G. South. In this agreement, the Kuna were promised respect for their traditions and culture, and a cease to certain laws which had imposed on their education system and traditional customs such as their dress. The Panamanian government pledged to protect and support the rights of the Kuna people. In return for this offering, the Kuna promised to cease their revolt by putting down their weapons, and withdraw their declaration of independence. They also promised to abide by the laws and regulations of the Panamanian government so long as they continued to abide by their agreement in respecting Kuna customs. This peace treaty was later followed by an agreement in 1938 which recognised the Guna Yala territory as being a reserve, and later the establishment of a representative body (The Guna General Congress) which would be recognised by the Panamanian government. = Politics = Following the peace agreement issued in 1925, it took time for the adjustments to be made and for Kuna society to integrate into Panamanian politics. Although a few Kuna villages did participate and vote in the Panamanian elections of 1920 and 1924, they did not fully immerse themselves in Panamanian politics until the elections of 1932. Up until the late 1920s, the Kuna villages were still very much divided into two camps, one being Pro-Colombian and the other Pro- Panamanian due to their history. This resulted in the leaders of both factions voting for different parties in the 1932 election in Panama. However, by 1935, 1000 Kuna voted in the election, and 2738 voted in 1940. By 1945 Kuna people were recruited at leadership level, this showing their slow but steady immersion into Panamanian politics.  The San Blas Islands today  The Kuna of San Blas whose population was numbered around 10, 000 then, has since increased to around 35, 000. There now exist 49 communities across the Guna Yala region and the entire region is governed by the Guna General Congress. The main source of their economy relies mainly on agriculture, tourism, fishing and other handiwork production, with the sale of molas and migrant labour being other sources of income. Despite struggles during the revolution, the making and wearing of molas is still considered to be an important and integral part of Kuna identity and culture, and the women are proud to be the only in the world who can make this dress. However, more recently internal pressures such as climate and social change, has resulted in the Kuna's having to expand their tourism industry. The expansion of this industry, and enabling more visitors to stay on the Islands, and development of hotels have been challenging for the Kuna's and their culture. Many hotels have exploited Kuna employees and culture. This has resulted in the Kunas controlling and limiting much of the tourism industry, making it much more difficult for Westerners to travel here.  Further reading  *Price, K. (2007).

Life George was raised in United Kingdom. George was inspired to take action after reading an article describing how many poor British women missed school due to stigma around menstruation and/or being unable to afford sanitary products such as tampons. She has said, \\"We need to make it very clear that we want to see equal access to education for all young people.\\" At the age of 17 she started a popular petition addressed to Westminster (which gained over 200,000 signatories), and while still in secondary school she founded the #FreePeriods organisation in April 2017. As part of her campaigning she has organised protests aimed at convincing the UK government to provide free sanitary products to schoolchildren, featuring speakers such as Adwoa Aboah, Suki Waterhouse, Jess Phillips, and Daisy Lowe. She has written for Vogue about the role of activism among young people, and also for The Guardian and The Telegraph about how the Scottish government's commitment to provide free sanitary products for poor students should be emulated in England. George has often commented on the lengths young people who menstruate go when they cannot afford pads or tampons, including using items of clothing, toilet roll, or using the same tampon many days in a row (putting them at risk of toxic shock syndrome). She additionally has remarked upon how education for men must be improved such that they can engage with tackling menstruation taboo and period poverty. In March 2019 chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond announced that secondary schools in England would receive funding to provide sanitary products free-of- charge to poorer young people. George and fellow campaigners welcomed the statement, and said that it should go further by expanding to primary schools (as menstruation can start as early as age seven) and enshrining the commitment in law for future governments. In response to her activism, George has been honoured on the Time Most Influential Teens of 2018 list, The Big Issue Top 100 Changemakers, and Teen Vogue 21 under 21 (after being nominated by Emma Watson for the latter). George won a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Goalkeepers Campaign Award in 2018, which she was presented with in a ceremony in New York City. As of April 2019 George is studying History at Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, and was described by college master Dame Barbara Stocking as 'inspirational'.

Biography Phillips was born to a Jewish family and graduated from Stanford University where he was the director of special events and was named Billboard's college talent buyer of the year. At Stanford, he was responsible for all bookings including Crosby Stills & Nash, Boz Scaggs, Fleetwood Mac, and Rod Stewart. After graduating, he went to the University of Santa Clara School of Law where he received a scholarship thanks to his booking prowess (Santa Clara had a 5,000-seat stadium at the time). He served as their stadium manager and was responsible for booking bands such as Lydia Pense, Cold Blood, Elvin Bishop, and Bruce Springsteen. After law school, he worked for NBC where he co-produced Rock Palace. He then signed a contract with K-Rock where he focused on New Wave artists, Haircut 100 and Modern English; and later booked Rod Stewart. Soon after, Stewart's manager, Arnold Stiefel, hired him to join his talent management company and Phillips quickly signed Billy Squier and Prince becoming a full partner after the first year. Phillips and Paul Gongaware managed Prince until Warner Brothers executives Mo Ostin, Lenny Waronker, and Michael Ostin parted ways with Prince. While with Stiefel, he also signed Simple Minds, Morrissey from The Smiths, Matthew Broderick, and produced the film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In the late 1980s, he contracted with Al Teller, the chairman of MCA (now Universal Music Group), to obtain acts for his newly-created record label called Gasoline Alley. He quickly signed Shai and later Sublime (an act his nephew found although he and his nephew kept the first two of Sublime's albums, 40oz to Freedom and Robbin the Hood, to themselves forming the independent label Skunk Records). He signed Toni Braxton and reached success with Un-Break My Heart a song Clive Davis brought to them from Diane Warren that they co-produced with David Foster. In 1994, he founded Red Ant Records with Al Teller who had left MCA where signed they Divine (which had the 1998 hit single Lately), Cheap Trick, and Salt-N-Pepa. In 1999, Irving Azoff engaged him to help book acts at the boutique concert company Concerts West (founded by Paul Gongaware and John Meglen) which had just been sold to the Anschutz Entertainment Group. As Phillips was close friends to David Zedeck and Larry Rudolph, he was able to book Britney Spears, Tom Petty, and Paul McCartney. Soon after, he became the CEO of Concerts West changing the name to AEG Live and reporting directly to CEO Tim Leiweke. While CEO, he hired Clear Channel executives Chuck Morris and Brent Fedrizzi; brokered the purchase of rival Goldenvoice; purchased 50% of Coachella; expanded into New York by taking over the staff (including Debra Rathwell) of Mitch Slater's Metropolitan Entertainment after it was purchased by Live Nation; and opened The O2 Arena in London hiring Rob Hallett as booking agent (opening with Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Bocelli). Along with Quint Davis and George Wein, Phillips successfully promoted the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and along with John Meglen was able to book Celine Dion to open the Colosseum at Caesars and then 50 nights with Michael Jackson thanks to company founder Philip Anschutz's friendship with Tom Barrack. After Jackson's death, he produced the memorial broadcast with Ken Ehrlich and Kenny Ortega. In 2013, went to work for Ashley Tabor-founded, radio operator Global Entertainment. In 2016, he was asked by Andrew Axelrod at Axar Capital and German insurer Allianz to run Robert F. X. Sillerman-founded concert promoter SFX Entertainment which they had purchased out of bankruptcy. Phillips hired Chuck Ciongoli and Gary Richards, renamed the company LiveStyle, and moved the headquarters to Los Angeles. Phillips felt that SFX as a brand had garnered a negative reputation, and that the company had originally collapsed because it focused too much on growing quickly, performing an IPO, and Sillerman \\"[selling] a story about sponsorship\\", which \\"has to be the icing on the cake ‚Äì not the cake itself.\\" Phillips also began to describe the company as being oriented towards electronic music in general rather than EDM, and stated that some of their events (such as Mysteryland) will broaden their scope (similarly to the Coachella Festival, which is owned by his former employer), but other events will remain predominantly oriented towards electronic music.

It sits on the historic site of the East India Docks and is currently occupied as a multi-use office campus as well as being the location of the Tower Hamlets London Borough Council.  History  The land occupied by Republic was historically used as the Import Dock of the East India Company. Following the dock's closure in 1967, the site was redeveloped in the 1990s as an office campus providing disaster recovery space for businesses at Canary Wharf. Following the site's acquisition by LaSalle Investment Management in 2016, a large-scale re-branding effort was put in place to position the site as a cultural and business hub for East London. Recognition that businesses were increasingly being \\"priced-out\\" of the City of London and tech-capital Shoreditch motivated the site's transformation into an affordable workplace. Signs of the historic past of the area remain, including the original boundary wall to the Import Dock and the naming of offices as The Import and Export buildings.  Architecture  The buildings were originally constructed in the postmodern style in the 1990s and the shells of these buildings still exist. Whilst plans for the demolition of the buildings and their replacement by residential accommodation were developed by architects 3D Reid in 2015, these were not implemented by developers Trilogy Real Estate who favoured the re-positioning of the site as a \\"Live, Work, Play\\" environment. Major renovation works, led by architects Studio RHE, began in 2016 in an attempt to modernise the campus. Extensive landscaping was instigated along existing waterways and plans submitted to construct Europe's longest open-air swimming pool. Internal renovations of the buildings focused on the remodelling of the existing atrium cores with the extensive use of Cross-laminated timber.

The floods has resulted in at least 70 deaths caused by collapsed buildings, mudslides and sinkholes. It is one of the deadliest disasters to hit the country in the 2010s decade. Cause Weather forecasters stated that the flooding was caused due to a cutoff low pressure system, which is often known to cause severe storms. The South African weather service later revealed that 165mm of rain fell over the city on 22 April 2019, breaking the previous record of 108mm that fell on October 10, 2017. It was also the heaviest rainfall the city has experienced in a 24-hour period since October 30, 1985.

A standard is a description of the quality required of a product, or a way of doing something that has usually been derived from the experience of experts in a specific field. The purpose is to provide a reliable method for people to share a reasonably consistent expectation regarding the scope and quality of the product or service. Training standards allow objective comparison between the training provided by various agencies and the competence indicated by certification or registration to the specific standard, though in most cases, training and competence may exceed the minimum requirement much of the time, and variation between newly certified divers can be considerable, partly due to differences in the training, and partly due to qualities of the candidate. Training standards may narrowly prescribe the training, or may concentrate on assessment of exit level competence, and allow recognition of prior learning based on various forms of evidence. To be useful, a training standard must be sufficiently specific to allow agreement on the requirements by most readers reasonably competent in the field, including the instructors, assessors, and learners who must use it, the employers of persons trained, the potential customers, and any quality assurance personnel who may need to enforce it. A training standard may be linked to a code of practice referring to how the training should be carried out. Contents of a diver training standard The contents would normally contain, but are not limited to, some or all of the following components. =Scope= The name of the qualification, the range of diving activities or specific skills that the holder is considered competent to participate in, the training authority publishing and authorising the standard, and the training establishments and personnel authorised or licensed to train according to the standard are usually specified. The training environment may also be specified. =Prerequisites= The prerequisites for diver training are basically of two types. For entry level training the primary requirement is that the person is medically fit to dive. Further requirements are usually of the type that indicate a high probability of success in the specific training programme, such as reasonable to excellent physical fitness and swimming ability, competence in the language of training, and basic numeracy. For advanced training the prerequisites are generally continued medical fitness to dive, and an existing certification of competence against a specific training standard or recognised equivalent, which indicates that the applicant was assessed as competent in the skills and knowledge considered necessary to allow them a good chance of success in the more advanced training program. Some training standards include a requirement for additional experience in terms of number of dives, hours of dive time or something similar, as a proxy for having practiced the prerequisite skills to the appropriate level of mastery. Other training standards allow the diver to progress directly from one training programme to the next, and assume that the experience and practice gained during training is sufficient to ensure adequate mastery to cope with the challenges of the more advanced programme. =Aims of the training programme= The detail of most diver training standards is in the description of the equipment which may be used and the conditions under which the certified diver may be considered competent to operate, and the required exit level knowledge and skill competences that provide evidence of ability to operate safely in these conditions. =Training methods= The training methods may be specified, but more often the result is considered more important than the methods, and instructors may be free to adapt their methodology to suit circumstances, particularly for theoretical knowledge. The reliable performance of critical motor skills under stress is often easiest to achieve by overlearning by repetition under varied conditions to develop muscle memory. This is usually more emphasised in professional diver training, and is also generally left to the school to ensure that skills are sufficiently practiced to be well retained. Complex skills are learned by incremental practice starting with the component actions and when mastered, combining them in more complex combinations. Stressors may be added later to further develop and test the reliability of response. This may be covered in the training standard by specifying both simple and complex skills and procedures. =Minimum acceptable competence= The minimum acceptable competence in terms of skills considered essential for a certification level that is defined by international standards agreements is interpreted by the training agencies according to their principles and applied by the individual instructors, so some variation is inevitable. The intention is generally that the diver should be sufficiently competent that the risk of serious injury or death is acceptably low for any person awarded certification and diving within the scope of their training. Competence is not a constant, and can improve with practice and deteriorate with lack of practice. Professional diver training works from the principles of occupational safety and health, and requires that the competence is sufficient to allow the diver to work effectively while diving safely in an environment that may not be ideal at the time, a situation of significant task loading, which requires a higher level of basic diving skills competence than recreational diving, where the diver is not expected to be distracted by other concerns while diving, has the option of choosing not to dive if they are not happy with conditions, and if they do task load, it is their own choice and they implicitly accept the added risk. Consequently, professional diver training tends to require more practice of safety critical skills and procedures during the training programme, and to require reliably repeated demonstration of those skills during assessment, sometimes under fairly stressful conditions. =Requirements for experience= Some skills and knowledge are not safety-critical. The learner is expected to have some reasonable working understanding of the theory and techniques and can hone their skills at the worksite. For these skills it may only be specified that they must do the exercise satisfactorily once or twice. A minimum number of hours at various depth ranges and a minimum number of dives is also a common requirement, as experience has shown these requirements to be fairly reliable at turning out reasonably competent divers. =Assessment= Theory knowledge is generally assessed by some form of written examination. In some cases the exam paper must be retained for a specified period as evidence of the assessment. Practical skills are generally assessed by direct demonstration of the skill, or where more appropriate, a simulation exercise (particularly for rescue and emergency skills, where a real emergency may be considered an excessive risk. Assessment of practical skills may be integrated with training exercises. Safety critical skills may be required to be demonstrated more than once to the required standard. Recognition of prior learning RPL is a process for evaluating skills and knowledge acquired outside the formal education environment to recognize competence against a set of standards. It is complementary to recognition of equivalent competence, where formal assessment has already been made against an alternative standard deemed to be equivalent. Registration The training standard may specify the procedure for applying for certification of registration, or this may be specified elsewhere such as in a code of practice or an instructor's procedures manual, Agencies publishing diver training standards Recreational diver training standards *List of recreational scuba diving certification agencies *List of freediving and snorkelling certification agencies Professional diver training standards *List of commercial diver training and registration authorities *List of scientific diving certification agencies =International and inter-agency harmonised standards= * World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) * Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques (CMAS) * International Organization for Standardization (ISO) * International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum IDRCF References Underwater diver training ","title":"Diver training standard"},{"id":"60600235","text":"Glendale Federal Savings and Loan Association, later Glendale Federal Bank, was one of the nation's largest federally chartered savings and loan association during the 1980s. It was long based in Los Angeles suburb Glendale, California, at 401 Brand Boulevard. The Glendale Federal brand was retired in 1998 when Glendale Federal was merged into California Federal Bank via a reverse merger engineered by Ronald Perelman and Gerald J. Ford, the owners of California Federal via their privately-owned First Nationwide Holding Inc. History The institution was founded 1934 as the First Federal Savings and Loan of Glendale. In 1982, the S&L; promoted itself simply as \\"Glendale Federal\\", dropping the \\"Savings and Loan Association\\" from its advertising and self-referencing. In 1983, the S&L; changed from a mutual organization to a federal stock form of organization. Among the many other S&Ls; that Glendale Federal acquired were: * La Jolla Federal S&L;, 1981 * First Federal Savings and Loan of Broward County, Florida, 1981 * Alameda Federal Savings and Loan Association, 1981 In 1988, it faced a federal probe on pay practices. By the early 1990s, Glendale Federal had started advertising as Glendale Federal Bank, although it continued operating as a savings and loan. In 1997, Glendale Federal Bank formed a holding company called Golden State Bancorp to allow it acquire other businesses. =Reverse merger with California Federal= In a very complex business procedure known as a reverse takeover or reverse merger, businessmen Ronald Perelman and Gerald J. Ford engineered the takeover of Glendale Federal Bank and Golden State Bancorp in 1998 by having public-owned Golden State Bancorp purchase Perelman and Ford's privately-owned First Nationwide Holding Inc. for $2.5-billion in stock which gave First Nationwide Holding's board of directors control of the new merged holding company, the new holding company retained Golden State Bancorp name and history, but the new savings bank retained the California Federal Bank's name and brand. Most of the managers for the combined company came from First Nationwide Holding along with First Nationwide's San Francisco headquarters building being retained. The saving bank merger resulted in the third largest thrift in the nation with $51 billion in assets and have more than 400 branches in eight states with 280 of those branches in California. The merger also resulted in the elimination of 60 California Federal and Glendale Federal branches and 1,100 out of the 8,400 jobs. Architecture The Glendale Federal building at 9454 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills is a landmark, as is the 1959 Glendale headquarters, designed by Wenceslao Sarmiento. In 1991, Universal Animation Studios opened its offices in the building at 121 Lexington Drive, which is part of the Glendale Federal headquarters, while the main building remained vacant. The studio operated here until 2006, when it moved its offices into Universal City, and the building was bought by Hollywood Production Center. In early 2009, Hollywood Production Center also purchased the main building.

During the first part of her career the tanker was used to carry oil and gasoline between United States and Asia, later becoming a coastal tanker serving East Coast of the United States. The ship was torpedoed and sunk in February 1942 on one of her regular trips. Design and Construction Early in 1919 Standard Oil Co. decided to add four more tankers of approximately 12,500 deadweight to its existing fleet, expanding their oil carrying business. A contract for these vessels was awarded to the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. China Arrow was the first of these four ships and was laid down at the Fore River shipyard in Quincy (yard number 1385) and launched on 2 September 1920, with Miss Fredericka H. Fales, daughter of F.S. Fales, President of Standard Transportation Company, serving as the sponsor. The ship was shelter-deck type, had two main decks and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The ship was equipped with wireless of De Forest type and had electrical lights installed along the decks. The tanker had a cargo pump room located amidships, and had ten double main cargo tanks constructed throughout the vessel with a total capacity to carry 3,665,700 US gallons of oil. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, and had a depth of . China Arrow was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 13,950. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 636 Nhp (3,200 ihp) vertical surface- condensing direct-acting reciprocating quadruple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch boilers fitted for oil fuel. The sea trials were held on October 1, 1920 in the Massachusetts Bay during which the vessel managed to reach maximum speed of and a mean speed of exceeding contract requirements. Following successful completion of full load run, the ship was transferred to her owners and sailed for Philadelphia and from there proceeded on her shakedown trip down to Gulf ports of Texas to load her first cargo for the Orient. Operational history After delivery to Standard Oil, China Arrow was assigned to Arrow Line and proceeded to Beaumont and Sabine to load her cargo. She departed Port Arthur on October 12 carrying 10,640 tons of oil for Woosung and other Chinese ports. After stopping at San Francisco for fuel in early November, the vessel reached Tientsin on December 4. After unloading her cargo the tanker returned to San Francisco in ballast on January 6, 1921 thus successfully concluding her maiden voyage. China Arrow conducted three more trips from California refineries to China before being laid up together with several other vessels in August 1921 due to shortage of cargo. The tanker was reactivated at the end of September 1921 and departed for another trip to China on October 3 carrying 4,000,000 barrels of kerosene. For the next twelve months China Arrow remained in the Far Eastern trade carrying oil and kerosene to Hong Kong, Shanghai as well as ports in Japan. On February 3, 1922 China Arrow was raided by harbor police and prohibition officials resulting in confiscation of large quantities of contraband whiskey and arrest of the first officer. In April 1922 the tanker took first oil cargo to Russia in many years, when she transported 80,000 barrels of oil to Japanese-controlled Vladivostok. From October 1922 and for the next nine months the ship was chartered by the United Petroleum Company to carry petroleum products between Beaumont and ports in the Northeast of the United States. After the end of the charter the ship returned to Oriental service and largely remained there through July 1927. The tanker served mostly ports in Japan and China, but her travels also took her occasionally to places as far away as Calcutta and Madras. In December 1927 the tanker sailed to Buenos Aires carrying nearly 100,000 barrels of gasoline. During 1928 China Arrow was serving route from San Pedro in California or Beaumont in Texas to ports of New York, Boston and Philadelphia carrying oil, gasoline and kerosene. After a brief return to Oriental service in 1929, the tanker was permanently moved to inter-coastal trade and remained in this capacity through the end of her career. At about 5 o'clock in the morning on July 26, 1938 in thick fog while leaving Boston on her trip to San Pedro China Arrow nearly collided with fishing trawler Dorchester who was rounding Graves Light just off Nahant. Due to low speed of the vessels there was enough time for both of the them to change course and barely scrape each other's sides. After conducting her last voyage to Beaumont in January 1939 Socony-Vacuum decided to retire China Arrow due to her advanced age and a joint with the government plan to build a fleet of new, more modern and speedier vessels. The tanker arrived in New York in early February 1939 and was laid up in anticipation of eventual break up. However, due to mounting shipping losses in the early stages of World War II the company was forced to reconsider and in late February 1940 China Arrow was towed to the dockyard of the Maryland Drydock Company where the old tanker was to be completely rebuilt at a cost of approximately 450,000. On August 9, 1940 it was reported that the US Maritime Commission approved charter of two American tankers by the government of the Soviet Union to deliver oil and motor fuel to the Pacific ports of Vladivostok or Nagaevo after the Soviet government bought over 1,000,000 barrels of high-octane automotive gasoline. China Arrow was one of the tankers selected while she was nearing the end of her rebuilding work and sailed from Baltimore on August 17 for San Pedro upon completion of all the required work and reached her destination on September 5. After completion of all the necessary procedures and loading, the tanker finally sailed from El Segundo for Vladivostok on October 25 carrying full load of gasoline. While en route, China Arrow was approved for another trip to Russia and after return from Vladivostok on December 24, sailed four days later with a similar cargo. During her second trip to Soviet Union China Arrow collided in Vladivostok harbor with an icebreaker and had to go to the Hunter's Point drydock upon arrival in San Francisco for repairs. Following return from her third and final trip to Soviet Union in May 1941, China Arrow proceeded to Aruba and delivered a cargo of fuel oil to Philadelphia in June of the same year. After one more trip to the Caribbean the tanker was reassigned back to her original route between Beaumont, Corpus Christi and other Texas Gulf ports and New York and Philadelphia where she remained for the rest of her career. =Sinking= China Arrow departed for her last voyage from Beaumont at the end of January 1942 carrying 81,773 barrels of fuel oil bound for New York. The tanker was under command of captain Paul Hoffman Browne and had a crew of eight officers and twenty nine men. In the morning of February 5 the tanker was off Winter Quarter Shoals, approximately from the shore and running a zigzag course. At approximately 11:15 local time the ship was suddenly struck on her starboard side in quick succession by two torpedoes fired by German submarine around #8, #9 and #10 holds. The resulting explosion blew the oil over 100 feet up onto the air and immediately ignited fire in the holds. The steam firefighting system was employed and managed to extinguish the fire in #9 and #10 holds, but failed to do so in hold #8. Seeing that the fire cannot be brought under control, captain Browne ordered the crew to abandon ship. Three lifeboats were lowered and everyone on board with the exception of the captain and radio operator Kenneth W. Maynard left the vessel at approximately 11:40. As the antenna was shot off after the first torpedo impact it was impossible to send the S.O.S signal, but the radioman managed to create an improvised one and send out the distress signal. U-103 surfaced soon after about 500 feet away and the last two remaining crew members on board China Arrow had to hastily leave the ship. The submarine then proceeded to fire between 15 and 20 shots from the deck gun into the damaged vessel causing China Arrow to go down stern first heavily listing on her starboard side at 12:30 in an approximate position . While the lifeboats were well provisioned and had blankets, most men left the vessel in such a haste that many of them had only their pajamas or underwear on. At approximately 15:45 US Army B-25A patrol plane spotted three lifeboats with survivors, and relayed the message to the Inshore Patrol (INSPAT). They also spotted what they claimed to be a diving submarine and proceeded to drop four 500-lbs bombs from approximately 1,000 feet with unknown results. At 16:20 patrol boat PE-56 and the Coast Guard cutter were dispatched to the reported location. The lifeboats managed to stay close together for the next two days while rowing towards the shore, and none of the crew suffered any serious adverse effects. In the afternoon of February 7 Norfolk-based aircraft sighted the lifeboats again and continued circling them until Nike arrived at the scene and picked up all survivors by 19:45. They were then taken to the US Coast Guard station at Lewes where they were all safely landed in the early morning of February 8. Captain Browne was given the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal by the President of the United States for heroism and distinguished service under unusual hazards. For the President the award was given by Admiral Emory S.

The rise of populism in the country has been attributed to the introduction of the mixed-member proportional electoral system, as well as to the populist nature of election campaigns, such as that of the Labour Party in the lead-up to the 1999 election. The New Zealand First party, which has historically taken a nationalist standpoint, is categorised as a populist party.  History  Robert Muldoon, the 31st Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist leader who appealed to the common man and utilised a personality-driven campaign in the 1975 election. Populist leader Winston Peters of the New Zealand First party Populism has become a pervasive trend in New Zealand politics since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional voting system in 1996. The New Zealand Labour Party's populist appeals in its 1999 election campaign and advertising helped to propel the party to victory in that election. Labour also articulated populism in its 2002 election campaign, helping return the party to government, despite its being entrenched as part of the establishment under attack by other parties employing strongly populist strategies, drawing on their outsider status. Those parties‚ÄîNew Zealand First and United Future‚Äîbenefited greatly in 2002 from running almost textbook populist advertising campaigns, which helped both parties increase their proportion of the party vote to levels unanticipated at the commencement of the election campaign. The New Zealand National Party made limited attempts at articulating populism in its advertising, but suffered from the legacy of being part of the 1990s establishment. In preparation for the 2005 election, then-leader of the National Party Don Brash delivered the Orewa Speech in 2004 on allegations of MƒÅori privilege. This speech has been labelled populist due to the polling beforehand which had revealed to the National Party that the topic of race relations was sensitive enough to sway voters, and its perceived intent to exploit long-held grievances in society. The success in the polls granted to the National Party by this speech led to the delivery of a speech dubbed \\"Orewa 2\\" the next year, this time on welfare dependency. This second attempt at a populist speech was less successful as voters perceived it as such.  Modern politics  New Zealand First has presented a more lasting populist platform. Long-time party leader Winston Peters has been characterised by some as a populist who uses anti-establishment rhetoric, though in a uniquely New Zealand style. New Zealand First takes a centrist approach to economic issues, typical of populist parties, while advocating conservative positions on social issues. Political commentators dispute the party's classification on the ideological spectrum, but state that its dominant attribute is populism. The party's strong opposition to immigration, and policies that reflect that position, as well as its support for multiple popular referenda, all typify its broadly populist approach. Peters has been criticised for reputedly inciting anti-immigration sentiment and capitalising on immigration fears‚Äîhe has highlighted the threat of immigration in both economic and cultural terms. Some academics, such as Ruth Wodak, contend that New Zealand First uses right- wing populist rhetoric, in common with parties such as UKIP in Britain. New Zealand First lost all their seats at the 2020 New Zealand general election.

The most popular form of cybercrime in Ghana is cyberfraud and is typically achieved via credit card fraud. However, recent decreases in universal credit card usage has seen the expansion of other cybercrimes such as blackmail and hacking. This growth in crime has warranted a government response, with policies specifically addressing the cyberspace being developed. This has necessitated various studies including a cyber security maturity study which was inaugurated by the Ministry of Communications and conducted by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Center (GCSCC) of the University of Oxford in collaboration with the World Bank.  History  Cybercrime in Ghana can be traced back to the \\"419 schemes\\" in Nigeria, also known as \\"advance-fee scams\\" prior to the internet. These scams were a form of credit card fraud whereby the perpetrator would offer a monetary incentive, usually in the form of an international money transfer, in exchange for several down payments from the victim. This form of scamming became especially popular during the oil crisis of the 1980s, as Nigeria's oil dependent economy made a large portion of the workforce redundant. Within this demographic was a large quantity of Ghanaian workers, who had migrated due to employment opportunities in the oil sector. Subsequently, the scammers imported the trade upon their return to Ghana, however, it remained relatively inconsequential in terms of scale. The proliferation of cybercrime in Ghana really began in the early 21st century when the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector became liberalized via a 5 year accelerated development program, helping to expand and improve telecommunications infrastructure. This led to a five percentage point increase in internet users from 2000 to 2011, with home internet subscribers reaching 3 million nationwide. This growth in internet usage, along with technological devices made available via e-waste, led to a significant increase in cybercrime due to relative ease of access to the cyberweb. Initially, credit card fraud was by far the most common cybercrime. However, since 2004, other types of both cyberfraud and other cybercrimes have become more popular.  Common Types of Cybercrime in Ghana  = Types of Cyberfraud =  Identity Fraud  This form of fraud involves the perpetrator assuming a fake online activity and will contact victims via social networking and dating websites. The most common form of this is \\"romance fraud\\", which involves fake profiles being generated in order to attract victims. Typically, older men and women are targetted and are manipulated into sending gifts and money either for romantic purposes or because of a promise of reciprical gain. These frauds have the ability to be relatively sophisticated through the use of doctored photos, diplomas and other identification documents.  Fake Gold Dealers  This form of fraud is similar to identity fraud insofar as both assume fake online personas to attract primarily Westerners. However, fake gold dealers target investors looking for short-term monetary gain by offering co-ownership of lucrative gold mines in the south of Ghana. Typically, the scammers will show real gold bars as well as offer tours of mining facilities in order to gain the trust of the investors, however, upon the receipt of downpayments from the victims, will close their business.  Estate Fraud  Unlike both identity fraud and fake gold dealers, estate fraud targets Ghanaians rather than Westerners. Quite often, Ghanaians will migrate abroad for employment opportunities, typically due to higher wages abroad, and come back to Ghana for retirement. These fraudsters set up fake websites offering luxury housing for those returning, and will offer to construct housing for them. The scammers sell blueprints, land and materials in progression to the victims, with the ultimate goal of maximizing wealth extraction. = Other Types of Cybercrime =  Blackmail  Ghana is home to the largest collection of e-waste dumpsites in the world. These sites consist of old electronic items including computers, laptops and mobile phones. Culprits will rummage through these items in search of sensitive hardrives, that may contain information to blackmail victims. An example of this was an attempt by Ghanaian cybercriminals to blackmail U.S. Congressmen Robert Wexler upon finding his old hardrive in an e-waste dumpsite.  Hacking  The greater availability of technology and internet services has allowed for the sophistication of hacking techniques in Ghana. Like elsewhere in the world, the hackers operate for-profit, mostly via the creation of fake websites aimed at tricking victims into inputting credit card information. Alternatively, Ghana has also seen the creation of pro-justice hacking groups or \\"ethical hackers\\", who have mostly targetted government websites with the goal of exposing corruption. Most cybercrime in Ghana is cyberfraud, through which perpetrators partake in fraudulent activities via the internet with the goal of financial gain. However, this may take many forms, with different tactics used depending on the culprit and the victim. Additionally, hacking and blackmail type scams have become more and more popular in recent years.  Sakawa  As cybercrime has increased in Ghana, it has seen the development of \\"sakawa\\", or the combination of internet based crime and West African traditionalist religion. Those who practice sakawa seek blessings from priests in order to improve cyber-scamming yields. In exchange, the perpetrators must perform specific rituals or activities in order to appease the spirits to which they pray. The popularity of this mixture between theology and cybercrime has led to the creation of the \\"sakawa boys\\" subset, which often flaunt jewelry and clothing as part of their aesthetic. Furthermore, sakawa boys also produce media such as film and music, which led to their mainstream breakthrough in 2007. Typically, sakawa boys tend to be male, under the age of 30, live near urban centres in slums, and are unemployed or underemployed, making the lifestyle available to them via cybercriminality appealing.  E-Waste  E-waste, or electronic waste, has presented significant security and health concerns in Ghana, as the country currently boasts the largest e-waste dumpsites in the world. The growth in e-waste is due to two main factors; the booming ICT industry within Ghana, and the lack of cheap domestic e-waste disposal sites within more economically developed countries. This has been facilitated by the necessity for cheap electronics in Ghana, as many are not able to afford new technology. The issue has only grown in severity as infrastructure in Ghana has not been able to coop with increased waste. Consequently, e-waste sites have had both significant security and health impacts, on both a domestic and international level. E-waste has, to some extent, allowed for the proliferation of cybercrime within Ghana, due to sensitive information not being properly wiped from hard-drives. For instance, in 2008, UK environmental agencies found computers belonging to the National Health Services and local councils, in the Agbogbloshie dumpsite in Accra. Although no crime was committed using the information on the technology, it raised significant security concerns internationally.  Statistics  Between 2016 and 2018, the country lost over US$200 million to recorded cyber crime cases. According to the Ghana Police Service, more than half of these reported cases were linked to fraud. Police also recorded an increase in cyber crimes in the country from 116 in 2016 to 412 in 2017 and further to 558 in 2018.  Government Response  = Legislation = The Ghanaian government saw cybercrime as an increasingly real threat by the mid-2000s. Up until the first major piece of legislation in response to the issue, the 2008 Electronic Transactions Act (Act 772), most convicted of internet fraud, a form of cybercrime, were charged in the criminal Code Act 20/60 Section 131. Critics argued that the lack of severity of punishment under this code, as well as a lack of relevance to the facts of some cases, meant that it served as a weak deterrent for cybercrime. Since Act 772 however, the Ghanaian parliament has continued to pass legislation specific to cybercrime, including the National Information Technology Agency Act, 2008 (Act 771) and the Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843). Despite this, some limitations with current legislation do exist, such as a lack of adaptibility to new forms of cybercrime and difficulty in collecting evidence to persecute under the new Acts. = Other Policies =  National Cyber Security Awareness Month  One of the major interventions by government was the launch of a cyber security awareness month to improve knowledge of the Ghanaian populace on cyber security. The National Cyber Security awareness month was launched in October 2018 on the sidelines of the launch of the National Cyber Security Awareness Program. The following are the themes for previous years: * 2018: A safer digital Ghana * 2019: Demonstrating Ghana's Cyber Security Readiness  Cyber security policy and strategy  Ghana has adopted a cyber security policy and strategy to increase security of its citizens and the state from cyber attacks. The document is divided into three sections highlighting the common cyber challenges in the country, the existing local and global initiatives to prevent cyber fraud and ways in which laws on cyber crime can be enforced. It also defines the role relevant government agencies can play in ensuring a secure cyber space. The policy also reviews what is classified as Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) ‚Äì \\"assets, systems and functions\\" whose destruction or ineffectiveness could affect the country's national economic strength, national image, national defense and security, public health and safety and government's ability to function effectively.

As of 2018, they comprise 58.8% of the state's population. 50.5% of the population is non- Hispanic white. The regions of Western Maryland, Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore all have majority white populations. Many white Marylanders also live in Central Maryland, including Baltimore, as well as in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.. Garrett County (97.5%) and Carroll County (91.9%) are the counties with the highest percentage of white Americans. Garrett and Carroll counties also have the highest percentage of non-Hispanic whites at 96.3% and 88.7%, respectively. Prince George's County (27%), Baltimore (30.4%), and Charles County (42.8%) have the lowest percentages of white people. Prince George's County has the lowest percentage of non-Hispanic whites, at 12.5% of the population. White Marylanders are a minority in Baltimore, Cambridge, Charles County, Jessup, Owings Mills, Prince George's County, Randallstown, and White Oak. Non-Hispanic whites are the plurality in Montgomery County, Columbia, Elkridge, Reisterstown, Salisbury, and Severn. Some jurisdictions such as Montgomery County and Columbia are majority white, but non-Hispanic whites constitute a plurality. Others areas such as Salisbury and Severn do not have a white majority, but do have a non-Hispanic white plurality. Several communities, largely in Prince George's County, have white populations of less than 10%. Langley Park is 9.9% white and 2.8% non-Hispanic white, Chillum is 9.6% white and 3.7% white, Clinton is 8.4% white and 6.9% non-Hispanic white, Coral Hills is 5.5% white and 3.2% non-Hispanic white, Kettering is 2.9% white and 2.6% non-Hispanic white, and Hillcrest Heights is 4% white and 1.7% non- Hispanic white. Other communities, mostly in Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, are over 95% white, such as Barton, Lonaconing, Midland, Ocean City, Oakland, Thurmont, and Westernport. As of the 2010 Census, the town of Luke in Western Maryland was 100% white. Demographics As of 2018, Maryland is 50.2% non-Hispanic white and is on the verge of becoming minority-majority. Only the majority-minority states of Hawaii, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas have a smaller percentage of non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic whites are expected to become the plurality ethnic group within 5 years of 2015. After Nevada in 2016, Maryland is projected to be the next state to become majority-minority due to growing African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic/Latino populations. By 2031, minorities are projected to become the majority of voting eligible residents of Maryland. Children from minority groups are already the majority of Maryland children. In 2017 , 41.6% of live births were to non-Hispanic white mothers. The top reported ancestries of white Marylanders are: German (15%), Irish (11%), English (8%), American (7%), Italian (6%), and Polish (3%).

The band reports directly to the Hellenic Army General Staff . It takes part in events of national importance in Athens. The band performs at state visits, military parades and the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. History After the start of the Greek War of Independence, a band called the Musical Troupe (ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫œåœÇ ŒòŒØŒ±œÉŒøœÇ) was created within the army. The troupe formed in 1824 started by French Colonel Charles Nicolas Fabvier. Based in then capital Nafplio, it was the first military band in Greek history. Its first principal musician was Ernst Michael Mangel, a German, who hailed from W√ºrttemberg. He came to Greece in 1822 and served the French Army as a captain. In 1825, Fabvier left for Athens and took the band with him. Under his command, the band took part in the Athens campaign of 1825, as well as expeditions on the islands of Euboea and Chios. In 1828, with the arrival of the first Governor of Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias, Mangel and the band returned to Nafplion, where the band was reconstituted and strengthened. In May 1834, the band was demobilized and led by the musician Branchel from Austria. With the transfer of the Greek capital from Nafplio to Athens in 1834, the band migrated to the new capital with K. Keller as conductor. In 1837, due to the shortage of musicians and Keller's death, the band came under the direction of Artillery Commander Franz Seiler, staffed mostly by foreigners, mainly Bavarians. On 15 November 1843, the School of Music was founded by royal decree of King Otto to recruit Greek musicians. That same year, Mangel returned to the army ranks and was entrusted with the management of the newly established school. In 1855, Mangel became the Inspector of Military Music. In 1856 the band gained its current status as a premier military band. A Jazz Octet was raised in 2014 in time for the 190th anniversary. Selected performances *In March 2015, as part of the celebration of the 190th anniversary of Greek military musicians, the Big Band of the Music Band under the direction of Captain Michael Hassouris held a concert at Pallini High School. *In February 2018, the band performed at the Embassy of Russia in Athens during a Defender of the Fatherland Day event, under the direction of Major Evangelos Samaras. *In 2018, the band hosted the Athens Military Music Festival. *In April 2019, the band, led by Konstantinos Konstantinopoulis, took part in a concert at the National Philharmonic in Skopje in honour of the 70th anniversary of NATO.

d'√©tat, also known as the Tbilisi War, or the Putsch of 1991-92, was an internal military conflict that took place in the newly independent Republic of Georgia following the fall of the Soviet Union, from 22 December 1991 to 6 January 1992. The coup, a violent representation of the chaos that engulfed the Caucasus at the beginning the 1990s, pit factions of the National Guard loyal to President Zviad Gamsakhurdia against several paramilitary organizations unified at the end of 1991 under the leadership of warlords Tengiz Kitovani, Jaba Ioseliani and Tengiz Sigua. Stemming from authoritarian actions undertaken by Gamsakhurdia, the Tbilisi War ended with the exile of the first democratically elected president of Georgia, after two weeks of violent clashes in the heart of the Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. Rustaveli Avenue, the main thoroughfare of Tbilisi, was ravaged by the conflict, which mainly consisted of a siege of the Georgian Parliament building, where Gamsakhurdia was isolated in a bunker. The coup d'√©tat, which only inaugurated a bloody civil war that lasted until 1994, is largely seen as an example of Russian military exploitation of legitimate pro-democratic protests in its former sphere of influence. This fact is mainly represented by the probable intervention of the Red Army in favor of opposition factions, while providing weapons to both sides of the war. Following Gamsakhurdia's fall, a Military Council, led by Kitovani and Ioseliani, took power in Tbilisi and assured the return of Eduard Shevardnadze, the last Soviet Foreign Affairs Minister to hand over power to him.  Historical Background  = Fall of the Soviet Union = Since the Red Army invasion of 1921, Georgia is one of the 12 member-republics of the USSR, a communist and authoritarian federation. Despite the de jure status as a sovereign nation of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Georgia, nationalistic feelings develop largely in the 1970s, feelings that will be repeated across the Soviet world. Large economic problems, the dictatorial nature of government, and the repression of nationalistic symbols lead to several protests in Georgia, culminating with the 9 April 1989 Tragedy, when a protest in Tbilisi is repressed by the authorities and results in the death of 21 people and the arrest of the main opposition leaders, including Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The Tbilisi Tragedy, coupled with the military failure in Afghanistan and the collapse of the Iron Curtain that separates Western Europe from the communist world lead to a chain reaction that witnesses the Baltic States declare their independence in 1990. Soon, Soviet authorities, under pressure of mass revolts, allow democratic elections in October 1990. = Ethnic Conflicts = The South Ossetia war is one of the main criticisms against Gamsakhurdia. The rise of Georgian nationalism lead to a rebirth of ethnic tensions with certain minorities within the Georgian State, most notably in the Abkhazian ASSR and the Autonomous Oblast of South Ossetia. Adamon Nikhas, a communist movement in South Ossetia, started to demand a larger autonomy from Tbilisi as early as the later 1980s, a request denied by the central government in November 1989. Tensions between Georgian nationalists and Ossetian communists rise until a declaration of sovereignty is proclaimed in Tskhinvali in September 1990, following which Tbilisi retaliates by abolishing entirely the local autonomy and dispatching a military faction to pacify the region. Gamsakhurdia's presidency only aggravated the conflict, especially after his promise of a \\"Georgia for Georgians.\\" In January 1991, the militarization of the conflict divided Tskhinvali in two, thus launching a civil war that lasted until June 1992 and that lead to the creation of the separatist Republic of South Ossetia. Meanwhile, Abkhazia fell in an ethnic strife. As early as 1989, violent clashes between Georgian and Abkhaz nationalists forced a certain division that extended into a \\"war of laws\\" between the legislatures of Tbilisi and of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia. = Deception in Tbilisi = The Act of Restoration of Georgian Independence signed on 9 April 1991. On 9 April 1991, two years after the Tbilisi Tragedy and ten days after a largely victorious referendum on the subject, the Georgian Supreme Council declared the independence of the country and appointed Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a famous dissident and spokesperson of local nationalism, as interim president. The latter was eventually elected president with 86% of the vote in an election that saw an 83% participation rate on 26 May. However, his presidency began with serious opposition, notably because of the large presidential powers granted upon him by Parliament, including: * Veto power over any law approved in Parliament; * War declarations and power to declare martial law; * Appointment powers over the Prime Minister, the presiding judge of the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces; * A total immunity As soon as October 1990, while Gamsakhurdia's nationalistic movement was already in power in Tbilisi under the de jure jurisdiction of the Soviet Union, the new government proceeded to close a majority of newspapers supporting the Communist Party. Molodyozh Gruzii, a youth magazine based in Tbilisi, was also closed 3 April 1991 because of Gamsakhurdia's allegations of collaboration with the KGB. Public television, under the new control of the nationalists, canceled all programming not openly supporting Gamsakhurdia's platform and in December 1990, 60 members of the Mkhedrioni militia launched a hunger strike in response. Political persecutions only increased following the independence. The independent newspaper Iberia was violently expelled from its headquarters in May 1991. Journalists were routinely excluded from press conferences and public television often accused its competition to be at the service of Moscow, while death threats and false criminal investigations were used by Tbilisi against renegade news anchors. International press was also largely repressed. Several political opponents were also persecuted by Gamsakhurdia. In February 1991, ten members of the National Democratic Party (NDP) in Kakheti and 56 members of the Mkhedrioni militia, including its leader, Jaba Ioseliani, were arrested. On 18 August, three ministers, including Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua, resigned from their posts and joined the opposition, accusing the President of becoming a \\"totalitarian demagogue.\\" Soon, the capital fell into chaos, merely a few months after the national independence.  Prelude  = Kitovani Leaves = Kitovani in the Rkoni Gorge following his mutiny. In January 1991, Zviad Gamsakhurdia signed an executive decree creating the National Guard of Georgia, a prelude to the future Georgian Army, under the jurisdiction of the new Ministry of Internal Affairs. At its head, he appointed Tengiz Kitovani, recently elected to the Supreme Council of Georgia with Gamsakhurdia's party, with a mission to recruit 20,000 capable soldiers. In February, the Ministry, while attempting to unify the several paramilitary organizations operating throughout the country, jails, with the help of Soviet forces, Jaba Ioseliani, a former criminal-turned-theater critique who lead the ultra-nationalistic Mkhedrioni, along with around 50 of his colleagues. Kitovani largely collaborated with Gamsakhurdia's war in South Ossetia, launching several assaults on the regions outside of Tbilisi's control between February and June 1991. However, the situation changed drastically during the summer of that same year. On 19 August, Gamsakhurdia took himself the helm of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice following the resignation of several government leaders. An attempted putsch in Moscow the next day brought a new controversy, with apparent rumors of Gamsakhurdia supporting the radical coup leaders going around Tbilisi, thus forcing Kitovani into disagreement. Soon, the Russian news agency Interfax published an article claiming that the Georgian President is readying to disarm the National Guard in order to integrate it within the Soviet Army, a claim soon denied by Tbilisi. On 23 August, Gamsakhurdia issued a presidential decree abolishing the position of commander of the National Guard, dismissing Kitovani, and brought the troops entirely within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Tengiz Kitovani, opposing this decision, left Tbilisi with a force of around 15,000 armed men and set up camp in the Rkoni Gorge, around 40 kilometers north of the capital. He was soon joined by Tengiz Sigua and former Foreign Affairs Minister Giorgi Khoshtaria. In retaliation, Gamsakhurdia banned the Communist Party, which included 60 members of Parliament at the time. In order to appease the situation, Tbilisi converted the local bureau of the KGB into a Department of National Security, which became a Ministry a few weeks later. A National Security Council was also created, proving that Gamsakhurdia wished to see a military infrastructure independent from Moscow. However, none of these reforms calmed Kitovani and his allies. = State of Emergency = Former HQ of the Tbilisi KGB, where several political prisoners were jailed by Gamsakhurdia. On 2 September, the situation becomes violent when demonstrations organized by the People's Front of Georgia and the NDP to ask for Jaba Ioseliani's freedom are attacked by MIA forces. According to the non-government organization Human Rights Watch, the protesters, assembled on Rustaveli Avenue, are beaten with batons, while soldiers shoot at the crowd, injuring three civilians. Giorgi Chanturia, leader of the NDP, is arrested by law enforcement, which only aggravates the tensions. Opposition members of Parliament, student groups, and other activists from throughout Tbilisi demonstrate daily in September. On 11 September, while 27 political parties sign a resignation request for Gamsakhurdia, the latter threatens to dissolve Parliament and builds barricades on Rustaveli Avenue. Historian Stephen F. Jones would later write that these provocations are direct threats for a civil war. On 22 September, a group of several dozens of protesters begin a hungerstrike in front of Parliament but are violently dispersed by 250 presidential guards and around 200 \\"furies\\", women partisans of Gamsakhurdia. On the night of 22‚Äì23 September, the situation falls even further into violence when around 5,000 Gamsakhurdia supporters, led by deputy Avtandil Rtskhiladze, enter the headquarters of the NDP, where they face some 800 members of the opposition. On 24 September, Zviad Gamsakhurdia proclaims a state of emergency. Government then begins a new round of attacks on the press, notably when Russian journalist Albert Kochetkov has his apartment robbed by 15 armed soldiers. Tengiz Kitovani, meanwhile, promises to support the political opposition to Gamsakhurdia and sends a support message to the members of the NDP through journalist Zurab Kodalashvili, who has his equipment confiscated by authorities. The number of political prisoners increases: Giorgi Khaindrava, a member of the Georgian National Congress political party, is arrested on 17 September, Valery Kvaratskhelia, a TV producer, ends up in prison on 2 October, and Goga Khindasheli, regional secretary of the NDP in Samtredia, joins them soon. On the night of 21‚Äì22 October, eleven members of the NDP are arrested as well, while Temur Zhorzholiani, leader of the Monarchist Party, is arrested on 15 November. They are all imprisoned in the Ortachala Prison in the south of Tbilisi. According to opposition leaders, the political conflict continues within the Ortachala Prison. NDP leaders allege that several riots are orchestrated to plan the murders of certain prisoners. On 25 October, the doors of certain prison cells are left open, leading to new riots that end with the intervention of a Soviet force that kills an unknown number of prisoners. The state of emergency in Tbilisi forces all formal political activity to pause. Thus, the NDP and the National Independence Party, two of the last remaining active opposition parties, suspend their activities shortly after demonstrations on 3 and 5 October. = Arrival of the Armed Opposition = Mkhedrioni flag Since the end of September 1991, Tbilisi is a divided city. The Gldani, Nadzaladevi, and Didube neighborhoods, as well as the south and center parts of Rustaveli Avenue (housing government buildings) remain under the military control of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who has started to isolate himself within the Parliament building. Neighborhoods located between the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute (29 Rustaveli Ave.) and the Tbilisi State University (1 Chavchavadze Ave.) are loyal to the opposition, while the Mkhedrioni militia uses the rest of Chavchavadze Avenue as its training ground. In the meantime, the neighborhoods of Vake and Saburtalo, populated by members of the Soviet intelligentsia, remain neutral. At the end of September, Tengiz Kitovani returns to Tbilisi, accompanied by some of his troops, but the administration brings thousands of Gamsakhurdia supporters from rural regions of Georgia. On 25 September, Irakli Tsereteli, leader of the National Independence Party, announces the onset of a civil war by threatening, \\"either we perish, or Gamsakhurdia will.\\" With 1,000 to 3,000 soldiers on each side, the first military fights take place in October, around the headquarters of the public television, while the opposition attempts to take control of the building to broadcast a message announcing the end of the Gamsakhurdia regime. Soviet authorities, still based near Tbilisi, use the internal chaos to sell weapons to both sides in order to worsen the situation. Georgian parliament building on Rustaveli Avenue Following the large arrests of political opponents, the central government wins light victories, managing to force Kitovani and his former National Guard troops out of Tbilisi. They would remain in the surroundings of the city until December. A temporary return to peace allows Gamsakhurdia to ban all political parties on 5 November, before closing the newspaper Sakartvelo-Sakinphorm. The same month, cars belonging to Tedo Paatashvili and Gela Chorgolashvili, two opposition leaders, explode in what Helsinki Watch calls a terrorist act. On 19 December, Tengiz Kitovani offers an ultimatum to Zviad Gamsakhurdia, asking for his immediate resignation. But the latter refuses, an act that would later be criticized by his own Minister of Foreign Affairs Murman Omanidze. On 20 December 1991, Tengiz Kitovani returns to Tbilisi, where he unifies his troops with those of the Mkhedrioni and the Merab Kostava Society militia. The next day, the Soviet Union is formally abolished and Georgia refuses to join the Commonwealth of Independent States. Zviad Gamsakhurdia barricades himself in the basement of the Parliament building. After having arrived in the capital, Kitovani announces, \\"We did not fight [Gamsakhurdia] actively while international opinion on the authoritarian nature of his personal dictatorship wasn't clear. So what we're now doing is not a military coup but rather the overthrow of a dictatorship with the goal of establishing democratic order.\\"  Combatants  = Loyalists = Zviadist fighters taking cover behind the Parliament building The lack of organization within governmental troops and the defection of a large amount of forces during the coup makes any attempt to estimate the size of troops loyal to Zviad Gamsakhurdia difficult. At the onset of the conflict, the National Guard, which includes merely a fraction of its 15,000 original soldiers following Tengiz Kitovani's secession, contributes to the majority of troops protecting the Parliament building, but the number of actual National Guard members participating in the conflict remains unknown, as a large part of the Guard remains in South Ossetia during the coup. While some western sources claim between 1,000 and 2,000 combatants fight for Gamsakhurdia, the latter estimates himself having 5,000 soldiers on his side. Sources become blurrier in the second week of the coup. Gia Karkarashvili, who leads the Military Council's war efforts, claims that the other side has no more than 250-300 men by 4 January, while the Russian news agency Interfax reported 300-500 Zviadist soldiers the day before. Other Russian sources, meanwhile, estimate nearly 1,500 Zviadists, 60% of which being armed, on 5 January. The Military Council, which represents the opposition, declared during the conflict that the majority of pro-Gamsakhurdia soldiers were 18 or 19 years old and were coerced into fighting. According to the Council, there was only a very small group of armed fighters belonging to the government's OMON, a special, highly trained branch of the National Guard. Some of those who fought on Gamsakhurdia's side were reportedly devoted female followers of his dressed in black, known as \\"furies\\" or the \\"Black Pantyhose Battalion\\". A youth militia from the mountainous region of Svaneti, nicknamed \\"Lemi\\" (·Éö·Éî·Éõ·Éò, or \\"Lion\\" in Svan) also fought for the president. The participation of foreign mercenaries remains a controversial subject, denied by Gamsakhurdia supporters. However, during a 4 January press conference by the Military Council, the latter condemns the use of Chechen mercenaries sent by Ichkeria President and close Gamsakhurdia ally Jokhar Dudayev. Jaba Ioseliani, leader of the Mkhedrioni militia, states then that \\"Jokhar Dudaiev's position is unacceptable and misplaced, but hope remains that this quid pro quo can be fixed.\\" On 5 January, four Ukrainian mercenaries probably working as snipers for the government are detained by the opposition. = Opposition = Opposition soldiers The majority of opposition troops come from rebel factions of the National Guard that followed Tengiz Kitovani during his August 1991 mutiny. However, while an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 members of the Guard pledged allegiance to the opposition's struggle, only a small part of these combatants participated in the Tbilisi battle, while the other soldiers remain in South Ossetia or Abkhazia to calm the ethnic tensions. Jaba Ioseliani commands a militia of 600 to 5,000 ultra-conservative soldiers that operate under the Mkhedrioni standard. This militia remains under the direct leadership of Ioseliani, even after the opposition's unification after the 2 January 1992 proclamation of the Military Council, and it is this militia that would cause the 3 January massacre. The Merab Kostava Society, which was organized as a political movement in 1990 before becoming an armed militia led by Vazhi Adamia, joined the rebel National Guard as early as 20 December 1991. Starting on 22 December, Tetri Artsivi (·Éó·Éî·Éó·É†·Éò ·Éê·É†·É¨·Éò·Éï·Éò, or \\"White Eagle\\"), a paramilitary group of around 80 men led by warlord Gia Karkarashvili and operating in the South Ossetia war, leaves Tskhinvali to assist the opposition. This militia would be used to put siege on Tbilisi and block all routes leading to the capital. Karkarashvili would later become one of the main figures in the Military Council, before taking the post of Minister of Defense during the Abkhazia War. The Union of Afghans, a militia made of veterans from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and which had remained neutral during the first stages of the coup, hesitates on joining the pro- Gamsakhurdia coalition at first. However, following the arrest of Nodar Giorgadze, head of the militia and Deputy Minister of Defense, rumors about his execution in the presidential bunker lead to the Union formally joining arms with the opposition. = Russian involvement = Vladimir Lobov, head of the Soviet army from 1989 to 1991. According to historian and close Gamsakhurdia ally Leila Tsomaia, there is a controversial theory about the beginning of the conflict. Zviad Gamsakhurdia, according to this version, may have had until 07:00 on 22 December to contact Boris Yeltsin and pledge Georgia's membership into the Commonwealth of Independent States. Gamsakhurdia's refusal to do so would have been what jump-started the hostilities. This version is confirmed by the President, who accused Yeltsin of being behind the coup. On 3 January, he repeated his accusations and nicknames the coup the \\"Kremlin's Putsch.\\" During the conflict, accusations of Russian assistance to one side or another were regularly made by both the President and the opposition. Thus, Gamsakhurdia complained from within his bunker that units of the Soviet Army \\"are not assisting the legitimately- elected President and, instead, are providing substantial help to the bandits of the opposition.\\" On the other hand, Jaba Ioseliani accused Gamsakhurdia of being too close to Russian intelligence services, claiming that three ministers (Foreign Affairs Minister Murman Omanidze, Internal Affairs Minister Dilar Khabuliani, and Technical Resources Minister Igor Chkheidze) were KGB agents. Despite these allegations, Yuri Grekov, First Vice-Commander of the Military District of Transcaucasia of the Soviet Army, denied any Soviet involvement in the conflict, while striking an agreement on the Soviet troops' remaining in Georgia after Gamsakhurdia's departure. In December 1992, nearly eleven months after the end of the conflict, Moskovskiye Novosti published a letter from Colonel-General Sufian Bepayev, who was then the vice-commander of the Transcaucasian Military District of the Red Army, who claimed to have brought logistical and military help to the opposition starting on 28 December. According to that letter, lacking the interference of the Russian soldiers, \\"Gamsakhurdia supporters would have had a guaranteed victory.\\" This version of the facts revealed also an involvement by Russian soldiers during the battle around the Broadcasting Tower of Tbilisi. However, another theory was provided by Greek strategist Spyros Demetriou, who revealed in a 2002 study the large implication of Soviet forces in the civil war. Shortly after Gamsakhurdia's election in 1990, Moscow authorities authorized a covert operation of introducing a large artillery of undocumented weapons into Georgia through Armenia and Azerbaijan, to be distributed among the several paramilitary groups set up by Georgian nationalists. As soon as early 1991, large caches of AK-47s and Makarov PMs were introduced on the Vaziani Military Base and into the Georgian stations of the DOSAAF. Nine Georgian, three Ossetian, and three Abkhaz militias were thus armed before the beginning of the civil war. During the coup itself, Sufian Bepayev may have provided weapons and armed vehicles to both sides. According to some sources, he may have begun by offering free weapons at the beginning of the coup, before starting to sell them: $200 to $300 per AK-47, $800 per Makarov PM, and $5,000 to $8,000 per armed vehicle. According to the Georgian Defense Foundation, the National Guard received, between 21 December 1991 and 6 January 1992, nearly 200 AK-47s, 50 RPG-7s, two SVD Dragunov rifles, and 200 Makarov PMs. Following the Military Council's victory, a special battalion of the National Guard was formed on 10 January and was entirely equipped by Russian military bases. Some analyze this weapons distribution scheme to be the natural result of the lack of order among remaining Soviet armies after the downfall of the USSR, given the harsh economic conditions of the Caucasus and the corruption of high- ranking military officials. However, Demetriou revealed another theory on the shared support from the Russians: > In his attempt to define and implement foreign policy objectives in the > post-Soviet sphere, Russian President Boris Yeltsin clashed with the > prerogatives of conservative and hard-line political and military actors. In > Georgia, these disputes manifested themselves in a duality of policy towards > the conflicts. Yeltsin favored a process of dialogue, negotiation, and co- > operation with the Georgian government. Russian military leaders, however, > viewed the preservation of Russian military influence and strategic assets > in the geostrategically important Caucasus as a primary goal to be attained > even at the expense of Georgian independence and through whatever means > possible. As a result, the Russian military conducted its own ‚Äòforeign > policy‚Äô in Georgia. The goal of this ‚Äòforeign policy‚Äô was to counter > Georgia‚Äôs rejection of any ties with Russia, such as within the CIS. The > means were destabilization and the creation of a situation in which > substantial and long-term Russian assistance (in the form of troops and > installations) would be required. By fueling belligerents on all sides of > the conflicts with weapons and other mat√©riel, Russian military leaders > accomplished both of these objectives.  The Conflict  = The First Day = As soon as Kitovani arrives in Tbilisi, battle plans are put into place. While the National Guard and government leaders fortify themselves within the Parliament building, Tengiz Sigua takes over the Tbilisi Hotel on Rustaveli Avenue, less than 250 meters away from Parliament, designating the building as the opposition's military headquarters. On 21 December, Otar Litanishvili, a commander of the Mkhedrioni, brings a detailed map of the capital within the HQ and military leaders plan the coming attacks. Tengiz Kitovani takes command of the upcoming assault on Parliament, being the most knowledgeable of the building's infrastructure, from his time as head of the National Guard. The opposition's preparations are largely made on the night of 21‚Äì22 December. Giorgi Arveladze, a Mkhedrioni officer (and future Minister of the Economy), is sent to inspect the surroundings of Parliament to confirm the location of governmental troops and soon, Rustaveli Avenue is blocked from the public, with both sides using buses and armed vehicles to isolate the most popular street of Tbilisi. Around 01:00, Gia Karkarashvili, who leads a militia of around 80 men known as Tetri Artsivi (\\"White Eagle\\"), leaves his post in Tskhinvali, where he is defending the Georgian neighborhoods of the city during the South Ossetian conflict, and sets up barricades on the main highway leading to Tbilisi from the north, in order to avoid any access to the capital, before leaving his soldiers in the outpost while bringing weapons to the opposition. His militia is armed with 50 AK-47s, 3 AKS74s, 20 AKS-74Us, and 50 cases of grenades. The morning of 22 December, according to the witness testimony of former deputy Sandro Bregadze, Sigua orders his personal guard, led by former Soviet secret service officer Murtaz Shaluahsvili, to position itself in Alexandrov Park (today known as the April 9 Park), in order to target the Parliament. With just the Kashveti Church serving as a buffer between both camps, government authorities send Mayor Tamaz Vashadze of Tbilisi and deputy Avtandil Rtskhiladze on a negotiation mission one last time before the beginning of the hostilities, but the two are kidnapped by Sigua's forces. Around 07:30, Murtaz Shualashvili orders the first fire against Parliament and Karkarashvili launches four rockets on the Parliament building, inaugurating two weeks of violence. According to a New York Times report, the opposition refuses to accept any responsibility with the first attack. Throughout 22 December, both sides use rockets, grenades, and automatic weapons to fight each other. The Kashveti Church, which houses opposition soldiers, becomes a target of governmental forces. The Gamsakhurdia household, nicknamed \\"Colchis Bell\\", catches fire, but the family, under governmental protection during the coup, remains safe. Hotel Tbilisi became, in December 1991, the HQ of the armed opposition. The Parliament building is entirely isolated, notably because of the preceding cut of all communication cables leading to and from Gamsakhurdia's bunker, a cut that was ordered by the President a few months before under the advice of his National Security Adviser, Otar Khatiashvili. Khatiashvili joins the opposition on the first day of fighting, while Communications Minister Phelix Tkebuchava, stays formally inside the government but collaborates with coup leaders by cutting the phone lines of Parliament. Throughout the day, rebels managed to enter Parliament twice, but governmental forces push back both times, before asking for a negotiation. The latter soon fails and the battle starts anew, while Sigua contacts Gamsakhurdia and warns him, \\"Your faults will not happen any longer. You should have resigned a long time ago. Now, you better come out with a white flag or we will take care of everyone.\\" Besik Kutateladze, the deputy minister of Defense, is sent by Zviad Gamsakhurdia to negotiate again with the opposition, but he betrays the President, joins the opposition and makes a televised declaration asking Gamsakhurdia to resign and to let a new Parliament punish all guilty parties behind the violence. Kutateladze then takes a helicopter and is sent by Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani to Zugdidi, in western Georgia, to prevent the formation of pro-Gamsakhurdia forces. Tamaz Ninua, deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, also joins the opposition. During the afternoon, Ilia II, Catholicos-Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, makes an appearance on Rustaveli Avenue, asking both sides to agree on peace, while remaining neutral during the conflict, a position that would later be criticized heavily by some Gamsakhurdia supporters. During the evening, Gamsakhurdia, remaining in his bunker with his family, addressed the nation, pretending that his forces had defeated opposition troops and pledging to not resign. Between seven and 17 people are killed during the first day of battle. = Escalation and International Reactions = The Kashveti Church becomes a target during the coup. The conflict intensifies on 23 December during a new direct assault against the Parliament, organized in the morning but rebuffed by the National Guard. During the day, the presidential plane is moved from one side of the Novo Alexeyevka Airport of Tbilisi to another, leading to rumors about a potential departure of Gamsakhurdia; these rumors are, however, denied by the government, which assures that the move is made for security purposes, while announcing a dubious advantage over opposition soldiers. The airport and TV and radio stations are temporarily closed. Russian TV, meanwhile, provides footage of vehicles armed with rocket launchers pointed at the Parliament building, before the beginning of a second attack against the structure, led by Tengiz Sigua himself, who predicts an imminent victory. The second attack on 23 December results in a temporary victory of the presidential forces, but the Art Museum of Georgia, across the street from the Parliament, catches fire. The Russian press agency TASS writes about the event that several people are stuck inside the museum with no way out, while fire brigades have no access because of the opposition blockade on the street. Gamsakhurdia recalls the remaining parts of his National Guard in Tbilisi in order to attempt a breach through the opposition's barricades outside the city, thus putting an end to any large Georgian military presence in South Ossetia. According to a New York Times report from Tbilisi, violence increases on 24 December and, while the sounds of missiles thrown against Parliament and the Television Tower of Tbilisi (two kilometers west of Rustaveli Avenue) are heard through the center of the capital, the worsening of the situation leads the U.S. State Department to publish America's first reaction on the Georgian civil war: > We find that President Gamsakhurdia's record on commitment to democratic > principles and internationally recognized human rights is poor. Political > and other disputes should be resolved peacefully and in a manner consistent > with internationally recognized human rights principles. We've called on > both the Georgian government and the opposition to observe these principles > in resolving their dispute. This reaction from the George H.W. Bush administration remains controversial among Zviad Gamsakhurdia supports up to this day. Moreover, the beginning of international recognition of Georgia's independence during the coup, instead of during the Gamsakhurdia presidency, will be criticized by Foreign Affairs Minister Murman Omanidze. Indeed, the United States, Canada, and Iran recognize Georgia on 25 December, followed by Brazil, Cuba, Thailand, and India on 26 December, Vietnam, Belarus, Egypt, Algeria, and China on 27 December, Jordan and Croatia on 28 December, Lebanon on 30 December, and Pakistan on 31 December. During this period, Omanidze is in Moscow to try and negotiate help from Russian president Boris Yeltsin, but the latter refused to meet the Georgian official, citing human rights violations in South Ossetia. While increasing the blockade around Tbilisi, Tengiz Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani offer a peace proposal to Gamsakhurdia on 24 December. The plan offers to treat members of government with safe conduct in exchange of the immediate resignation of the President, an offer refused by the head of state. At the end of the day, some international reports estimated the number of dead between 23 and 50 Georgians and 168 to 200 injured. Russian television shows footage of civilians evacuating the bodies of victims during the evening. On 25 December, the number of dead grows to 30-80 victims, according to US media. = The New Year = The TV Broadcasting Tower was one of the war's targets. The most severe battle of the coup d'√©tat takes place on 27 December when Tengiz Kitovani's troops penetrate inside the Parliament and put fire to the first floor of the building with gasoline. The Health Ministry announces after during an interview with The New York Times that, \\"we have no idea what's happening, except for the fact that there are shootings around Parliament.\\" However, this doesn't prevent Human Rights Watch, a US-based NGO, from publishing an official report the same day formally accusing the Zviad Gamsakhurdia government of human rights violations. The 18-page report becomes the only source of information on the Gamsakhurdia presidency among many western circles. The publication decries the political persecutions of the government against the opposition, the arrests of Mkhedrioni members, the ethnic strife in South Ossetia, and stops its narrative on 22 November 1991. During a press conference, representatives from HRW announced that they were \\"not in a position to evaluate the commitment toward human rights of the disorganized opposition.\\" Rachel Denber, the main author of the report, acknowledges the militarization of the opposition during a U.S. interview, while underlining the fact that \\"a good portion of the opposition remains dedicated to fundamental rights.\\" On 28 December, it becomes clear that government forces have lost all control outside of the presidential bunker and Tengiz Kitovani, followed by a Mkhedrioni detachment, captures the former Soviet office of the KGB in the Gldani neighborhood, where several opposition leaders are imprisoned. Eight prisoners are freed and brought to Rustaveli Avenue to encourage fighters, including Giorgi Chanturia, Giorgi Khaindrava, and the titular head of the Mkhedrioni, Jaba Ioseliani. The latter takes back his control over the militia and Chanturia announces that the civil war must continue until the resignation of Gamsakhurdia. On their way, the Kitovani troops burn down several buildings of strategic importance, including the National Bank of Georgia and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, leading to the destruction of nearly 210,000 documents (or 80% of the entirety) of governmental archives from the Soviet era. At the end of 28 December, the number of dead had risen to at least 42, and 260 injured. On 31 December, Nodar Giorgadze, deputy Minister of Defense and leader of a militia made up of veterans from the Afghanistan War, publicly asks for Gamsakhurdia's resignation, leading to his arrest. He is soon joined by Murman Omanidze, the Foreign Affairs Minister and one of Gamsakhurdia's closest advisers, following his failed negotiating trip to Russia. = A Military Council = On 1 January 1992, opposition forces capture the Broadcasting Tower of Tbilisi, allowing them to control televised messages. On 2 January 1992, opposition leaders, assembled within the Academy of Sciences, announced the establishment of a Military Council. The Council becomes the only government recognized by members of the opposition and Zviad Gamsakhurdia becomes an usurper in the eyes of many. While the complete makeup of the Council's administration is never made public, Tengiz Kitovani and Jaba Ioseliani proclaim themselves Council leaders, while nominating Tengiz Sigua as head of government and Prime Minister and the Parliament is dissolved. Aleksandre Chikvaidze, the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands, is appointed Foreign Affairs Minister, former Soviet military commissar Levan Sharashenidze is named Minister of Defense, and Vakhtang Razmadze becomes the Chief Prosecutor. Theoretically, the Gamsakhurdia government remains the only legitimate entity recognized by major foreign powers, but it isn't clear which government is recognized by Laos, Ethiopia, and Iraq, which recognize Georgian independence the day of the Council's creation. Kitovani and Ioseliani sign together all the junta's decrees, including a first decree deposing the Gamsakhurdia cabinet, before abolishing the Constitution in a second decree. By ordering such moves, opposition leaders claimed to want to restore the old Democratic Republic of Georgia's 1921 Constitution, but this restoration will only happen in late February and the country operates under the junta's unilateral control for a month. In order to convince the civilian population of the opposition's democratic intentions, the Military Council announces the formation of a consultative assembly made of political and intellectual figures (\\"open to all, except Zviad Gamsakhurdia\\") to represent political parties, ethnic minorities, and the intelligentsia. A curfew is established the same day by the junta across Tbilisi, prohibiting anyone from leaving their homes from 23:00 to 06:00. Zviad Gamsakhurdia, whose troops consist of a just a few hundred guards at this point, asks, from his bunker, the Georgian people to ignore the Military Council's decrees and to follow only \\"the Constitution, the laws of the Republic and those of its democratically-elected government,\\" while asking for a hunger strike and refusing to resign. The main battle on 2 January takes place during the evening when, around 18:00, governmental troops attack with trace fire the Iveria Hotel, controlled by the opposition and less than one kilometer north of the Parliament building and which includes a Red Cross station. The opposition retaliates from the Academy of Arts building, leading to a fierce battle on Rustaveli Avenue until 22:00. By the end of 2 January, Gamsakhurdia's Health Ministry counted a total of 73 dead and 400 injured since the beginning of the conflict. Gia Karkarashvili is named military governor of Tbilisi by the Military Council. = Events Outside of Tbilisi = While Tbilisi falls into chaos, the rest of Georgia (except for South Ossetia) remains more or less calm during the first week of the conflict. However, the events affected some rural zones in January 1992. Thus, while Georgian television falls under opposition control on 1 January, all programming is stopped in western Georgia, which had remained loyal to Gamsakhurdia, thanks to the capture of the broadcasting tower of Kutaisi by Zviadists. In the same manner, while a majority of the country stops receiving newspapers following the closure of printers in Tbilisi during the coup, western Georgia keeps its pro-Gamsakhurdia newspapers thanks to the printers of Kutaisi. On 4 January, Zviad Gamsakhurdia signs a decree from his bunker requiring all municipal and regional governments outside of Tbilisi to organize a large-scale mobilization of troops against the opposition, an act described by some as a call for guerrilla warfare. This order requires the mobilization to take place until 7 January and mandates the local governments to open mobilization centers to welcome all military conscripts, aged 20 to 45 years old. Local authorities are also under the obligation to organize transport for this theoretical army. However, without a National Guard, this decree cannot be enforced. In response, the Military Council announces the abolition of local governments and declares its intent to appoint local governors loyal to the opposition. According to an announcement by the Council, the majority of local government centers fell into the junta's control by 18:30 on 4 January. However, the country still includes some cities loyal to the President; a gun battle takes place at the Rustavi City Hall, 25 kilometers south of the capital, between the local government and Military Council troops, on 5 January. No injury is reported from this battle. = Repressing Demonstrations = 3 January protesters fleeing after an attack by the Military Council. On 3 January, it becomes clear that the Gamsakhurdia government has no longer enough forces to defeat the opposition. However, the Western press questions the strength of the opposition, notably because of the bunker's advantageous position, but also because of the lack of any decisive force by either side. Ashot Manucharyan, National Security Adviser to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosian, arrives in Tbilisi the same day in order to broker a peace between the adversaries and convince them to sign a peace agreement; however, Gamsakhurdia is offended by the meeting between the Armenian delegation and the opposition. Zviad Gamsakhurdia states his last speech from his bunker in the morning: > While we have almost achieved the true independence of the republic and her > recognition and the world's powers, a few traitors of our homeland are > attempting to threaten our independence by creating a Military Council, in > the same nature as the revolutionary committee of February 1921. Today, our > nation's destiny is to be decided. I ask everyone to rise to defend the > homeland, to defend the future of our children. The entire population of our > republic has to come to the defense of its legitimate and democratically- > elected government. The government is in entire control of the situation and > continues to direct the republic's infrastructure. We have overcome many > obstacles on the road to independence. We believe that now as well, the > Georgian people shall overcome the current situation with honor. I ask you > to form defense committees and to resist the decisions of the Military > Council. I ask you to organize large demonstrations, many strikes, and other > acts of civil disobedience. While the Military Council issued a new decree forbidding all protestations, an assembly of 3,000 to 4,000 Gamsakhurdia supporters organize a demonstration around 12:00 on 3 January, starting from a railway station several miles from the battlefield. The protesters, including mainly middle-aged men and women, carry the President's portrait, while chanting his name (\\"Zviadi!\\") and walking toward Rustaveli Avenue. After just 15 minutes, a car transporting masked men of the Mkhedrioni throws smoke bombs on the crowd, which only angers and energizes it, while encouraging applause from civilians on their balconies. But a group of eight to ten masked men wearing sunglasses to hide their identities, form a line in front of the demonstrators and start shooting blanks to disperse the crowd. A few instants later, real bullets are fired at the protesters, who disperse violently while some take refuge behind cars. Two protesters are immediately killed and several are injured, including two more who would die a few days later. View of Rustaveli Avenue, center of the war. The events of 3 January increase the rhetoric between both sides. Jaba Ioseliani announces during a press conference that the decision to violently disperse the demonstration came directly from the Military Council, due to the junta's decree banishing all demonstrations. He called the massacre \\"normal\\" and threatened to repeat the orders if Tbilisi residents continued to violate the Council's decrees, while apologizing to four journalists who had their equipment confiscated by opposition forces. Ioseliani accuses the elite OMON forces of Gamsakhurdia of having provoked the Mkhedrioni soldiers. Zviad Gamsakhurdia, whose forces captured and tortured two of the Mkhedrioni soldiers responsible for the shooting, compared, during an interview with British TV station Sky News, the Military Council to \\"terrorists and criminals\\" on 4 January. During that same interview, he refused a new offer to negotiate his resignation with the opposition and compared the shooting to the January 1991 events in Lithuania, when Soviet troops shot and killed several protesters fighting for independence. At 18:00, Sigua announces on television an ultimatum to the President, giving him until 08:00 the next morning to resign. The Military Council temporarily ceases fire and blocks all access to the Parliament building, except for the street behind the building in order to allow Gamsakhurdia soldiers to leave the battlefield. The President refuses the ultimatum while offering a compromise: a serious limitation on executive powers, a referendum on the existence of the President's position, the restoration of South Ossetian autonomy, a return of Meskhetian Turks exiled in Central Asia since the 1940s, the liberation of political prisoners, and membership into the Commonwealth of Independent States. This offer is refused by the opposition, following which Gamsakhurdia declares, > I have tried several times to put an end to the killing, but it seems > impossible to discuss with the opposition, as it is only a gang of > criminals. The only thing left to do is to fight, fight, and again, fight. > Of course, it is not an easy thing to accomplish, but a peaceful solution is > only possible if the Georgian society mobilizes itself, and the latter > remains passive at the moment. I know that we can defeat the rebellion with > our military force, but it will take time. Gamsakhurdia's refusal leads to tensions within the bunker, escalating when two parties cause a violent brawl due to a disagreement on the follow-up strategy. After shots are fired within the compound, a large part of the fighters leaves the Parliament building and, by 20:00, only 500 guards protect the government. Following false rumors on the executions of Nodar Giorgadze and Jemal Koteliani, two members of the government imprisoned in the bunker by Gamsakhurdia, the Military Council draws up plans to launch a new attack against the Parliament. = Last Battles = The interior of Parliament was taken by force by opposition soldiers several times. On 4 January, while Jaba Ioseliani announces a plan to abolish the presidency and institute a parliamentary system in Georgia, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor General's Office pledge allegiance to the Military Council. In response, governmental forces attack the Prosecutor's office, injuring two but failing to occupy the building. Another combat takes place during the night when pro-Gamsakhurdia troops attempt to take over the television broadcasting tower with grenade-launchers, but fail to win this fight as well. These skirmishes, however, take place while the opposition manages to block all radio transmissions coming from the bunker and ceases fire on the Parliament building to allow troops to flee from the bunker. Another demonstration of around 2,000 Gamsakhurdia supporters takes place on 5 January, during which protesters listen to speeches in favor of the President, before advancing in the street changing the head of state's name. While rumors of masked men approaching in cars create tensions within the group, the demonstration takes place peacefully and disperses itself naturally within a few hours. The same day, the last fighting between the Military Council's forces and those of Gamsakhurdia take place. While the residents leave massively the center of Tbilisi, Tengiz Kitovani wins a new fight on the Zulabashvili Brothers Street, behind the Parliament building, finalizing the surrounding of the last government stronghold. Tengiz Sigua, meanwhile, announces publicly that one of his biggest critiques toward Gamsakhurdia is the latter's hostility toward Russia and predicts that Georgia will rejoin the Commonwealth of Independent States once Gamsakhurdia is gone. On 5 January, Russian newspaper Postfactum publishes an interview with an anonymous presidential guard that accuses the President of having forbidden any escape of his troops, threatening any soldier attempting to flee with execution. Loyalist troops attempt one last time to take on the Broadcasting Tower of Tbilisi. At 20:12, the Military Council launches a last violent attack on the Parliament building, isolating Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The latter receives then an asylum offer from the Armenian President via telegram. Richard Hovannisian, Caucasian History professor at UCLA, states then that \\"at this point, we have no idea where Georgian voters stand.\\" At the end of 5 January, at least 90 dead and 700 injured are recorded by the Ministry of Health, while the Military Council insists that the number of victims goes as high as 200 dead and 900 injured. = Gamsakhurdia's Departure = Zviad Gamsakhurdia On the morning of 6 January, around 05:00, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, his family, and a personal guard of 60 dignitaries and bodyguards leave the Parliament through the road behind the building, the only way out left open by opposition troops in order to control the presidential escape and prevent a dispersion of armed Gamsakhurdia supporters across the capital. The President and his family leave in the presidential car, a Mercedes-Benz, and, followed by an all-terrain vehicle, a minibus, and two Zhigulis, escape a roadblock installed along the Mtkvari river by Giorgi Shengelia, Vakhtang Kikabadze, and Giorgi Khaindrava. Opposition forces penetrate then into the abandoned and ruined Parliament, some supporting columns of which are entirely destroyed, proclaiming victory against the Gamsakhurdia government and freeing the 40 prisoners left in the bunker (two of which are taken to a local hospital after showing signs of torture.) According to opposition forces, Zviad Gamsakhurdia left Tbilisi with some 700 million rubles from the state treasury. Some Ikarus buses leave the Parliament with loyalist troops shortly after the President's departure, but these do not manage to leave the city in time and are caught in an ambush on Leselidze Street, during which six loyalist soldiers are executed by orders of Karkarashvili. Those that remained inside the Parliament building, led by interim Parliament chairman Nemo Burchuladze, are captured. A last fight takes place in the western part of Tbilisi, near the Murkhatberdani Cemetery, in the afternoon. Once calm is restored, an anti-mining squad is sent into the bunker to clean the area. In exile, Zviad Gamsakhurdia crosses the Azerbaijani border at 09:20 and, escorted by 12 vehicles, arrives in Gandzha at 12:15. Helicopters are deployed by the Military Council to search for the fleeing President, while Tengiz Kitovani spreads false rumors about the capture of Gamsakhurdia by Azerbaijani authorities, rumors soon denied by the Military Council's Ministry of Defense. While some reports show that the exiled Georgians are attempting to reach Baku before crossing the Russian border into Daghestan, Gamsakhurdia ends up in the Armenian town of Idzhevan, in northern Armenia, with a following of 150, in the evening. Kitovani and Sigua sign then a declaration announcing the fall of the \\"dictatorship\\" and several soldiers are seen celebrating on the fallen Parliament's steps. In Tbilisi, the center of the city is entirely destroyed. The Ministry of Communications, the Tbilisi Hotel, the National Art Gallery, the Rustaveli Avenue Cinema, and other national emblems are ruined, while the Artists' House is full of bullet holes and even houses a rocket that never exploded and that would stay on site for several days. Rustaveli Avenue itself is filled with broken windows, fallen trees, and burnt cars. The Metekhi Bridge, the main communication point between both sides of the Mtkvari river, is set on fire by Mkhedrioni soldiers. Eduard Shevardnadze, former communist leader of Georgia and last Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, announces his intention to return to Georgia in order to assist the Military Council and, according to American geopolitical analyst Thomas L. Friedman, \\"the George H.W. Bush administration didn't know what to say, and so they said nothing.\\" At the end of the conflict, official estimates show 90 dead and hundreds of injured, but contemporary MIA sources now show the total number of dead to be 113 Georgians.  In the Bunker  Gamsakhurdia and his guard in his bunker During the coup, the Zviad Gamsakhurdia government continues to assemble inside the bunker. Almost the entire cabinet is present, as well as a majority of members of Parliament. The latter continues to function in an official manner, despite the absence of its chairman, Akaki Asatiani. On 2 January, the present members vote to require the presence of Asatiani in the bunker, giving him a deadline of 11:00 on 4 January, a deadline ignored by Asatiani, who instead asks for Gamsakhurdia's resignation. Inside the bunker, conditions are deplorable. One fighter described the bunker during the conflict as \\"unsanitary\\". In order to prevent the spread of dysentery, soldiers are given regularly a cocktail of medications, while the poor food rations are described as \\"bad\\". Aggravating the sanitary conditions, dead soldiers are amassed in the bunker and, after Gamsakhurdia's departure, the Military Council reveals a room with dozens of corpses. Under these conditions, some witnesses note that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's personality changed drastically. Murman Omanidze, his minister of Foreign Affairs, described him as \\"detached from everything, because of the massive stress befallen on his shoulders.\\" The President leads the bunker in an authoritarian manner and organizes torture sessions against opposition prisoners. Later, some victims attest of the torture methods used by Gamsakhurdia partisans, including severe beatings, electric shocks, and suspension by shackles. Prisoners are jailed in cells created specifically for the conflict and are under the supervision of the minister of Trade. The Military Council claims after the coup that two prisoners were executed inside the bunker, but this claim was never verified by international press. On 3 January, Tengiz Kitovani claims being in possession of a video proving that children from a local orphanage were taken by force into the bunker to serve as unwilling hostages and prevent any violent attack by the opposition, a claim denied by Gamsakhurdia.  City Conditions  View of Rustaveli Avenue after the conflict Tbilisi, the largest city in the Caucasus, suffers largely during the coup. According to Murman Omanidze's testimony and Russian media coverage, 80% of the downtown area's building are destroyed in the battle, leading to a large number of refugees. The Red Cross establishes a station in the Iveria Hotel, less than 900 meters from the Parliament building, and a volunteer rescue service called Santeli (·É°·Éê·Éú·Éó·Éî·Éö·Éò, \\"candle\\") is formed to aid civilians affected by the conflict. The level of criminality increases considerably during the two weeks of the conflict, with a large number of robberies and carjackings. In some cases, armed men form roadblocks and force drivers to empty their gas tanks. Moreover, the Military Council claims that gangs of armed partisans of Gamsakhurdia terrorize the population several times, a claim that the Russian newspaper Postfactum cannot confirm. Gia Karkarashvili is appointed as military governor of Tbilisi on 2 January, in charge of preserving peace within the capital. A state of emergency is proclaimed starting at 00:00 on 3 January and Karkarashvili forms a militia to patrol the streets before the state police, neutral during the first half of the conflict, takes over on 5 January following the appointment by the Military Council of the popular police chief Roman Gvantsadze as Minister of Internal Affairs. Karkarashvili's militia imposes strict rules on the population. A curfew prohibits anyone in the street at nighttime, while the Military Council-declared state of emergency authorizes the paramilitary group to arrest anyone walking in the street to inspect their identification documents, to testify as they are Gamsakhurdia supporters or not. Only Tbilisi residents are allowed to stay within the city for more than 24 hours during the conflict, while others are given a one-day permit. Daily services are also largely affected. While the subterranean metro continues to function normally, other public transportation means are interrupted. An economic crisis affects Tbilisi as shopping centers are closed and markets lose supplies due to farmers remaining in the countryside. Moreover, several neighborhoods suffer from electricity shortages. The Tbilisi airport is mined. Phone lines, cut as soon as the coup began by the Ministry of Communications, are reestablished on 4 January by the Military Council. During this time, newspapers stop being printed due to fears of attacks by pro-Gamsakhurdia partisans. Postal offices and telegraphic stations are closed as well. On 9 January, Military Council Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua held a press conference where he detailed the total damages caused by the coup d'√©tat. According to him, a total of 10,000 square meters of housing were burnt down, leading to 252 families (759 people) becoming homeless, for which two hotels, two sanatoriums, and some state-owned dachas outside of Tbilisi were set aside as temporary housing. The total cost of the damages was estimated to be between 500 million and 1 billion rubles.  After the Coup  = Continuing the Fight = Jokhar Dudayev, President of Ichkeria, welcomes Gamsakhurdia in Grozny. On 7 January, Zviad Gamsakhurdia proclaims his government to be in exile, insisting that his legitimacy remains valid and the coup cannot be recognized by the international community. However, this claim is soon rejected by the Military Council, whose legal counsel, Ron Migrauli, writes an op-ed for the daily \\"Free Georgia\\" claiming that an armed revolution against a dictatorship, even if elected and recognized by the international community, must be legitimate by international law. In order to demonstrate their support over the deposed president, a crowd of several hundreds of protesters demonstrate in the streets of Tbilisi the same day, ignoring the Military Council's decrees. Jaba Ioseliani orders his troops to intimidate the crowd by shooting blanks, dispersing the demonstration and injuring two. Several volunteers in Tbilisi and Mingrelia, Gamsakhurdia's native region, begin to organize and recruit armed supports to plan a counter-revolution. Vakhtang Razmadze, the junta's appointed prosecutor, sends a delegation made of Alexandre Kasvadze, Giorgi Shengelia, Deputy Prosecutor Revaz Kipiani, and Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Givi Kvantaliani to Armenia in order to negotiate a peaceful return of the exiled president to Georgia, offering a promise of freedom in exchange of an end to his presidential claims, a proposal refused by Gamsakhurdia. On 13 January, a second delegation, chaired by Eldar Shengelia and including Chabua Amirejibi, Grigol Lortkipanidze, Giorgi Khaindrava, Vakhtang Kikabadze, and Rivaz Kipiani, go to Yerevan to meet with Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosyan and National Assembly chair Babken Ararktsyan. However, the latter two refuse to extradite Gamsakhurdia. Lortkipanidze, one of the Georgian delegates, pens a letter signed by a dozen members of the Tbilisi intelligentsia asking for solidarity from the Armenian intelligentsia. The same day, Zviad Gamsakhurdia and his family take a private plane with a Georgian pilot and leave Armenia for Grozny, the capital of Ichkeria, whose president, Jokhar Dudayev, still recognized the legitimacy of the government in exile. Two fighter jets, sent by the Military Council, attempt to force the plane down, but fail. = Consequences =  Change of Power  Eduard Shevardnadze became the head of the Georgian state as soon as March 1992. Besides the temporary destruction of the downtown district of Tbilisi and the death of more than one hundred Georgians, the consequences of the December 1991-January 1992 civil conflict will be felt throughout the 1990s. The Military Council, in power in Tbilisi for another two months, creates an authoritarian and military regime across the country, until the arrival of Eduard Shevardnadze in March. The latter, who had already announced his support of the opposition and his offer to come to Georgia's aid since 5 January, becomes the new head of state and has to spend several years to establish his central power, facing the militaristic ambitions of both Tengiz Kitovani and Jaba Ioseliani. It's only in 1995 that the next presidential elections are held and formalize Shevardnadze's leadership.  Civil War  Gamsakhurdia's departure marks only the beginning of a civil war that would plunge Georgia into chaos until 1994. After a few months, Gamsakhurdia returns to Georgia through Abkhazia, setting up camp in Zugdidi, Mingrelia's regional capital. After having expelled the new central government's forces, Gamsakhurdia and his supporters, who are called \\"Zviadists\\", establish an opposing government in Western Georgia, pushing Mingrelia into a civil war until his death on 31 December 1993. Throughout the 1990s, Mingrelia would become the target of violent political persecutions orchestrated by the Mkhedrioni militia to fight against the remaining Zviadists.  Defeat in South Ossetia  An even more direct consequence is the situation unveiling in South Ossetia during the conflict. While the region is in the midst of a separatist war against the Ossetian minority, the coup gives the rebels the opportunity to strengthen their position. Gamsakhurdia and his opposition recall one after the other their Georgian militias stationed in South Ossetia, giving a clear advantage to Ossetian soldiers. On 4 January, Tengiz Epitashvili, the presidential representative in the South Ossetian conflict, joins the Military Council and pledges to keep his last National Guard bastions in place to protect Georgian territories; but the same day, opposition leaders offer a ceasefire and a peace proposal to the separatists. As a show of good faith, Kitovani and Ioseliani free Torez Kulumbegov, the former Soviet leader of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast imprisoned by Gamsakhurdia during the beginning of the Ossetian rebellion, on 5 January. This opening is, however, ignored by the Ossetians and the self-proclaimed Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia announces a general mobilization of all men aged 18 to 60 to use the Georgian setback at their advantage. A defense committee made of ten mobile units is formed on 5 January to defend Tskhinvali and attack Georgian positions. Znaur Gassiev, who leads South Ossetia during Kulumbegov's absence, predicts that \\"if this evil Gamsakhurdia wins, our people shall have to fight until the end if Russia does not recognize us. And we will have to perish as we will not leave our lands and Gamsakhurdia will not let us live here.\\" During that winter, Ossetians capture all of Tskhinvali and several villages. The separatists' victory would be confirmed during a ceasefire signed by Shevardnadze in June 1992. As of today, South Ossetia remains under the separatists' control.  Analysis  George H.W. Bush (left) and Boris Yeltsin (right). The Tbilisi War remains a difficult memory for much of the capital's population. Rustaveli Avenue's destruction is represented by these words told by a civilian during a special report by The New York Times: > You need to understand, Rustaveli was where we used to play hooky from > school, where we'd take a girlfriend on a nice walk. It was the heart of > Tbilisi. We saw the scenes on television, but we had no idea that it was > this bad. Serge Schmemann, who covered the post-Soviet world for The New York Times, talks of a Georgian tragedy that forced \\"Georgian national heroes against Georgian national heroes.\\" Thomas L. Friedman, a US geopolitical journalist, talks of the coup d'√©tat as the onset of a decisive change in the United States' interventionist politics following the fall of the USSR: > The coup d'√©tat is at the heart of the next great debate on America's > foreign policy... The question is, are these new democrats mocking > themselves, or are they mocking us? It's clear the George H.W. Bush > administration saw through Gamsakhurdia. The American reaction toward the putsch shocked several Georgians who had been convinced that the United States represented Russia's geopolitical alternative. However, it soon becomes clear that Washington sees Boris Yeltsin's Russia as a potential ally in the new post-Soviet world and for that reason, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, who often criticized human rights violations made by Gamsakhurdia, ignored the same violations done under Eduard Shevardnadze, even supporting and advising the latter's presidency. Murman Omanidze, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Gamsakhurdia who fled Tbilisi after being accused of treason during the revolt, analyzes while in Moscow that the coup is not a conflict between the government and its opposition, but rather between different factions of the same party: > The popular version that this conflict is between the opposition and the > Georgian President's partisans is incorrect. The fight is between the > members of the coalition on top of the Republic... The dozens of true > opposition parties are not participating in the conflict and prefer to wait > before expressing themselves on the subject. On 11 March 2005, the Georgian Parliament adopted a resolution calling the 1991-1992 events a \\"violent and anti-constitutional military coup\\". In 2008, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili accused Tengiz Kitovani of operating as a Russian \\"agent\\" during the civil conflict.

The Dunard Centre is expected to cost ¬£45million, of which ¬£25million will be contributed by the local and national governments as one of the investments facilitated by the city region deal. Further support is coming from Carol Grigor, an American arts benefactor, through the Dunard Fund. The fund also agreed to underwrite any cost overruns or capital deficits in the Dunard Centre's first three years of operation. History In December 2016 an international design competition was announced by the international music and performing arts charitable trust (IMPACT) Scotland to be located to the rear of Dundas House, a Royal Bank of Scotland building, at 36 St Andrews Square. The area is within the New Town UNESCO world heritage site, which has seen considerable development in recent years, with new developments at 3-8, 35 and 42 St Andrews Square, as well the recent Multrees Walk and ongoing St James Centre redevelopment. Many Scottish architects, as well as much of the Scottish press and the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS), expressed dismay at IMPACT's decision to run the competition from London, which was seen as sidelining Scottish practices. A shortlist of six architects was released in late January 2017, consisting of Adjaye Associates (with Sandy Brown, Buro Happold and DHA Designs); Allies & Morrison (with Charcoalblue, Speirs & Major, Harrison Stevens and Buro Happold); Barozzi Veiga (with Alan Baxter, Max Fordham, Kahle Acoustics, 3DReid and Ian White Associates); David Chipperfield (with Arup, Whitby Wood, GROSS MAX and Theatre Projects); KPMB (with Simpson & Brown Architects, David Narro Associates, Arup, Sound Space Vision, rankinfraser landscape architecture and Transsolar Energietechnik); Richard Murphy (with Arup, Graven Images, GROSS MAX and Montagu Evans). In April of that year, David Chipperfield architects were announced as the competition's winners, along with Edinburgh firm Reiach and Hall, with a public consultation running until the 30th. On 23 August 2018, the developers lodged their planning application with the City of Edinburgh council. This design differed slightly from earlier renders, with the lower floors being pared back and simplified. On 24 April 2019, the Development was approved by six votes to four votes by the Development Management Sub Committee of the City of Edinburgh Council after five hours of debate.  Reception from the arts community  The centre has been attracted the attention of residents and heritage groups due to its design and location within the Old and New towns of Edinburgh, a UNESCO world heritage site: Fergus Linehan, the head of the Edinburgh International Festival, said that \\"artistically and socially, it‚Äôs a truly transformational project for the Festival.\\" He went on to say the hall would provide a space or acts that would not be suitable for the city's existing concert hall, the Usher Hall, saying \\"If you‚Äôre talking about new composers, and digital or electronic work, they don‚Äôt really fit into that\\". The Festival hope the hall will become \\"an exciting place to be\\", which they say will make it \\"easier for [them] to attract new and younger audiences\\". The Scottish Cultural Secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said \\"The economic and cultural benefits will be felt throughout Scotland.\\" Adam Wilkinson from the Edinburgh World Heritage Trust praised the architects for showing \\"a good understanding of the World Heritage Site\\". The Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland emphasized a need to project the existing Dundas House building, describing it as \\"arguably the most important town house in all of Scotland\\". The charity claimed the development would \\"detract from the historic building‚Äôs character, greatly diminishing its special interest and status as the focal point of the east end of Edinburgh‚Äôs New Town plan\\". They lodged a formal planning complaint with the council over the Dunard Centre's \\"excessive scale and massing\\". A local heritage group, the Cockburn Association, supported the plans, saying they \\"welcome the considerable effort the developers have undertaken to positively consult with a wide variety of stakeholders\\". The group believed the building would \\"contribute significantly to the artistic life of the city\\" and serve as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the surrounding area. The group praised a number of aspects of the Dunard Centre proposal, such as the public access through the site's ground floor lobby, although they requested legal recognition of this right-of-way for the long term, and the site's strong transport links and proximity to tram and bus stops and Waverley Station. However, the Cockburn Association stipulated a number of recommendations they had for the project that the annex block rooftops feature simple, clear roof detailing to avoid large sections of panelling, or that the building's final surface finishes be made to acknowledge the surrounding buildings‚Äô stone exteriors. They also had concerns about concert attendees' cars overstraining parking in the New Town. They sought to encourage attendee parking within the St James Centre development, possibly through a relationship providing reduced evening parking rates. The group also proposed that there be an integration between public transport and concert ticketing, such as free bus or tram tickets being included, to encourage its usage. The Edinburgh International Book Festival expressed an interest in holding future events in the Dunard Centre, which is located at the opposite end of George Street from their current site in Charlotte Square. Opposition from property developers The centre has been controversial with local businesses, however: the developers of the nearby St James Centre, TH Real Estate, lodged a complaint about the Dunard Centre's proposed lorry access, which would see daily HGV deliveries along a pedestrianised shopping street. They also criticised the building's height, suggesting it would block views from and of their W Hotel as the well the building's large size and its facade, describing it as being made \\"entirely of concrete\\". In response, the Dunard Centre's owners threatened to sue the St James Centre‚Äôs developers after they distributed letters urging surrounding residents and businesses to object to the concert hall's development. The Dunard Centre's developers claim the letters were factually inaccurate and that the hall would benefit the local area. TH Real Estate also complained that the Dunard Centre had not been made to bury their building services underground, which their neighbouring development had been forced to. Gleneagles, a local hotel, also objected to the concert hall, saying they had not been included within the planning submission's noise impact assessment. The Dunard Centre's developers released a statement saying that the concert hall and studio space would feature \\"high sound insulation performance\\" and would thus provide \\"effective control of noise emissions to neighbouring buildings\\".

In August 2020, it was announced that it was being developed into a full television show, with Cooper and original series star Will Smith as executive producers. In August 2020, it was announced that Will Smith and Morgan Cooper would be developing a reboot of the series based on Cooper's Bel-Air. The series had reportedly been in the works for over a year since Cooper posted his Bel-Air trailer on YouTube, with Netflix, NBC's Peacock, and HBO Max all currently bidding for the series. On September 8, 2020, Peacock gave Bel-Air a 2-season order. In September 2020, Peacock picked up the TV series based on the short film for a two-season order. Plot After being involved in a gang fight during a street basketball game, Will Smith is sent by his mother out of the rough streets of Philadelphia to live with his uncle and aunt in the affluent neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles, in the hopes of straightening out his life. The film is supposed to take place in 2019. The trailer is heavily influenced by modern-day popular culture, according to Cooper in an interview.

The technique was introduced by Swiss ophthalmologist Daniel Mojon around 2007,D. S. Mojon: Comparison of a new, minimally invasive strabismus surgery technique with the usual limbal approach for rectus muscle recession and plication.

Bierlaagh: Chirurgie horizontale et cycloverticale simultane¬¥e du strabisme. Centrum voor Strabologie, Antwerp 1994.  Indications  MISS is a technique that can be employed for all major types of strabismus surgery like rectus muscle recessions, resections, plications, reoperations, transpositions, oblique muscle recessions, or plications, and adjustable sutures, even in the presence of restricted motility. The smaller openings and the less traumatic procedure are in general associated with faster postoperative rehabilitation and less swelling and dyscomfort for the patient immediately after the procedure. It is supposed that the technique can be performed as an outpatient intervention in many patients (mainly adults) who would otherwise be hospitalized. D. S. Mojon: Review: minimally invasive strabismus surgery. In: Eye. 29, 2015, S. 225‚Äì233. A study published in 2017 documented fewer conjunctival and eyelid swelling complications in the immediate postoperative period after MISS than after conventional strabismus surgery with long-term results being similar between both groups.Gupta P, Dadeya S, Kamlesh, Bhambhawani V: Comparison of Minimally Invasive Strabismus Surgery (MISS) and Conventional Strabismus Surgery Using the Limbal ApproachJ Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2017;54:208-215.. Another advantage is that MISS technique may decrease the risk of anterior segment ischaemia in some patients, particularly those suffering from Graves' ophthalmopathy. Kushner BJ. Minimally invasive strabismus surgery. Comparison of a new, minimally invasive strabismus surgery technique with the usual limbal approach for rectus muscle recession and plication. Br J Ophthalmol 2007;91:5.  Principle  In MISS the operating microscope rather than magnifying glasses should be used by the surgeon. Instead of one large opening of the conjunctiva as is done in conventional strabismus surgery, several small cuts are placed where the main surgical steps, usually suturing, have to be performed. Openings are placed as far away from the corneal limbus as possible to minimize postoperative discomfort. Between two of these incisions, called keyhole openings, there is a \\"tunnel\\" used by the surgeon to insert the instrument for the treatment of the eye muscles.Asproudis I, Kozeis N, Katsanos A, Jain S, Tranos PG, Konstas AG. A Review of Minimally Invasive Strabismus Surgery (MISS): Is This the Way Forward?Adv Ther. 2017;34:826-833. At the end of the operation, the keyhole openings are closed with resorbable sutures. These mini-incisions are postoperatively covered by the eyelid. MISS openings markedly reduce the frequency and severity of corneal complications like, for example, dry eye syndrome and dellen formation, and will allow wearing contact lenses earlier. Long-term benefits are avoidance of an increase of redness of the visible conjunctiva and a decreased scarring of the perimuscular tissue, which will facilitate reoperations - if those should become necessary.D. S. Mojon: Review: minimally invasive strabismus surgery. In: Eye. 29, 2015, S. 225‚Äì233.  Clinical results  The results after MISS regarding postoperative ocular alignment are widely described in the so far still limited literature on the technique to be about the same as in classical strabismus surgery. This was documented, for instance, in comparing 40 children; the group that had undergone the minimally invasive procedure, however, did show less swelling of the conjunctiva and the eyelids after surgery.P.

Operating on the muscles through the tunnel is more demanding on the surgeon. The keyhole cuts may tear in older patients. If the tear involves Tenon's capsule, a visible scar may result. An excessive bleeding that cannot be stopped makes an enlargement of the cuts necessary to cauterize the vessel. Usually, a conversion to a limbal opening as in classical strabismus surgery can be avoided. There are few reports, though, on complications that are unique to MISS. D. S.

Written probably in 1896, it recounts the puranic mythological tale of Nrusinhavatar. It was first staged by the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Company in 1899 but was unsuccessful. It was staged again in 1906-07 and became successful. It was edited and published as the book by Dhirubhai Thaker in 1955.  Plot  Hiranyakashipu (centre) wielding a mace against Nrusinh (left) and Prahalad stands praying. The mythological tale of Nrusinh, Hiranyakashipu and Prahalad is the source of the play. Due to curse of Sanaka and others, Vishnu's gatekeepers Jay and Vijay are reborn on earth as Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu to sage Kashyap. When Hiranyakashipu learns that Hiranyaksha is killed by Varaha incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu, he swear to take revenge. He went to perform penance to have a boon of immortality from Prajapati. Indra abducts his pregnant wife. Narad saves his wife and his son Prahalad and returns them to Hiranyakashipu when he returns. Prahalad is sent to study. He was an ardent devotee of Vishnu so he continues to chant Narayan (name of Vishnu) even after the prohibition by his father. Hiranyakashipu tries to kill him with various means but Vishnu saves him each time. At last he orders his on to embrace a hot iron pillar in the court but Vishnu appears in the incarnation (avatar) of Nrusinh from the split pillar and slays Hiranyakashipu.  Characters  The principal characters are: * Hiranyakashipu - The king * Queen of Hiranyakashipu * Prahalad - Son of Hiranyakashipu * Vishnu - The celestial God * Laxmi - Wife of Vishnu * Jay and Vijay - Doorkeepers of Vishnu * Shambuk and Hyagriva - Commanders of Hiranyakashipu * Narad - Celestial being and the devotee of Vishnu * Indra - Celestial lord * Kashyap - Sage * Diti - Mother of Hiranyakashipu * Nrusinh - avatar of Vishnu  Sets  * Forest, Vishnu temple, Ashram of Kashyapa, Parijat forest, court of Hiranyakashipu, queen's palace, square outside the palace, court of Indra, celestial space, forest * Court of Hiranyakashipu, queen's palace, Ashram of Shukra, jester's house, Shukra's Ashram, private room of Hiranyakashipu, queen's palace, drawing room, queen's palace, forest * palace, forest, mechanic's house, seashore, queen's palace, forest, Somdatta's house, queen's palace, court of Hiranyakashipu  Theme and style  The play recounts the Hindu puranic mythological tale of Nrusinhavatar, an avatar of Vishnu with a picture of contemporary household. The mythological tale is taken from the Prahaladavritanta chapter of seventh book (skandha) of Bhagvata Purana. The character of a jester named Somadatt and his household is included for the public interest. The characterisation of the characters was praised by Dhirubhai Thaker for their diversity. The play is written in the style of the Sanskrit play having a prologue praising the deity, a stage-manager and the happy ending but also considering the public interest and the stage requirements. There is also an influence of English plays in theme of conflict, tragic characterisations and satire. The play focuses on devotional aspect. It has 64 poems including 35 songs. There are Sanskrit and Gujarati shlokas as dialogues in the play. Some songs including \\"Tum Tananan Harigun Gao...\\" and \\"Premkala Balihari\\" became very popular then. According to Thaker, the friendship of Prahlad and Devdutt included the play reflects Dwivedi's lifelong longing for a pure friendship. Duty is a central theme of the play. All characters in the play are bound by their duty and are conflicted by their loves. The play becomes more intense as it progresses and culminates in climatic appearance of Nrusinh.  History and reception  Following success of Dwivedi's play Kanta based Kulin Kanta in 1889, the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali asked him to write another play. Nrusinhavatar was his second play written around end of 1896. It is believed that Dwivedi had made some changes in the play and its songs for the stage performance. He probably had discussed the changes with Dayashankar Visanji Bhatt, the director. Some songs were added in the stage adaptation by Vajeshankar Kalidas. Nrusinhavatar was first staged on 18 February 1899 by the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, a year after the death of Dwivedi. It was commercially unsuccessful probably because its director and the actor playing the lead character of Hiranyakashipu were Parsis. In 1906‚Äì07, it was again staged by the Company and run successfully for around thirty nights. It starred Jaishankar Sundari as Laxmi, Bapulal Nayak as Vishnu, Prabhashankar Jagjivan 'Ramani' as Prahalad, Jatashankar Oza as Hiranyakashipu, Dayashankar as Kashyap, Jethalal D Nayak as Diti and Nannu Gulab Panwala as a jester. The first seven or eight shows were houseful and the Company earned the good amount of revenue. Jaishankar Sundari opines that it was one of the most successful devotional aspect focused plays. The success was attributed to mythological characters, use of local dialects, colloquy of jester and use of sarcasm by stage-manager who instigates quarrels in the play. As the Company had bought the rights of the play including its publication rights for Rs. 500 from Dwivedi, it was not published for decades. It was finally edited and published as the book by Dhirubhai Thaker in 1955.

The house had been used by the militants to manufacture explosives and suicide vests. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up, killing nine of their family members, including six children, while four other suspects where shot dead by the soldiers. A civilian was killed and two others were injured during the crossfire.  Background  Following the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, the Sri Lankan government initiated an operation to locate suspected ISIL-loyal National Thowheeth Jama'ath terrorists. Special Task Force received a tip from a traffic police officer about a house in Sainthamaruthu with a group of suspicious people. The Special Task Force went onto raid the house under suspicion. The ISIL-aligned Amaq News Agency later claimed that the National Thowheeth Jama'ath militants of Sainthamaruthu had prepared an ambush at the house, and had voluntarily lured the security forces into attacking them.  Attacks  When the Special Task Force tried to enter the house shots were fired from inside. The security forces exchanged fire with those inside the house for about an hour. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up killing 9 people, while police confirmed three other suspects were killed in the engagement. Three women and six children were killed in the suicide bombings by the terrorists. A civilian was killed in crossfire. Those killed in the raid were identified as Zahran Hashim's father Mohamed Hashim and his brothers Zainee and Rilwan, with Rilwan being one of the suicide bombers. The Amaq News Agency released a statement claiming that the militants at Sainthamaruthu had been loyal to ISIL, and that they had managed to kill 17 Sri Lankan security forces. It also published a photo of Zahran alongside his brother Rilwan. The family released a final video message before being killed, which suggested that they had indeed been linked to ISIL.  Aftermath  Fifteen bodies were initially recovered from the site of the clash. Security troops also recovered explosives, detonators, gelignite sticks, acid bottles, detonating cords, ISIL flags, suicide kits, and military uniforms. A woman and a child injured at a nearby house during the explosions were taken to the hospital and received police custody, suspected to be the wife and daughter of Zahran. A curfew was imposed in the area till further notice. The bodies of 10 adults were buried without religious rites on 2 May but the 6 children were buried with Islamic funeral rites. However, the bodies were exhumed on June to collect DNA samples as the previous samples were too contaminated. The Sri Lankan Police awarded ‡∂ª‡∑î.500,000 ($) to the police officer who tipped off the Special Task Force about the safe house in Sainthamaruthu.

He was a graduate of United States Military Academy in 1834 and served in the Seminole Wars. In 1848, he became involved in a post-war squabble between several general officers, though it did not harm his prospects. After his exploits in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he was appointed Inspector general of the US Army. A promising career was cut short when he died of yellow fever on an inspection tour of Mobile, Alabama in 1849. Early career James Duncan was born on September 29, 1811, at Philipstown, New York. He became a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York on January 1, 1831, and graduated on July 1, 1834, as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd Artillery Regiment. He was posted to the garrison of Savannah, Georgia in 1834‚Äì35. He became a full second lieutenant on November 17, 1834. He taught mathematics as an assistant professor from February 14 to April 7, 1835. He fought in the Second Seminole War in 1835‚Äì36. He fought in skirmishes on February 27‚Äì29, 1836 near Camp Izard where he was wounded. He also fought at Oloklikaha on March 31 the same year. On November 30, 1836, he was promoted to first lieutenant. In 1836‚Äì37, he transferred to Fort Trumbull in Connecticut where he was placed in charge of public property. In 1838 he again served in the Second Seminole War before helping to supervise the Cherokee removal, part of the Trail of Tears. He was posted to northern frontier during the Canada border disturbances and then to Cleveland, Ohio. He was posted to Buffalo, New York in 1838‚Äì39. He went to a camp of instruction at Trenton, New Jersey in 1839. He was at Buffalo again in 1839‚Äì41, helping to police Canada border disturbances. He transferred to Fort Hamilton in New York in 1841‚Äì42, Fort Adams in Rhode Island in 1842‚Äì43, and back to Fort Hamilton in 1843‚Äì45. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War =Early successes= In 1841 an artillery system emerged where the M1841 6-pounder field gun and the M1841 12-pounder howitzer were adopted as light artillery. At the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the US Army maintained four artillery regiments, each with 10 companies of 50 men each. However, there were only four highly trained light artillery batteries: Duncan's Company A, 2nd Artillery Regiment, Samuel Ringgold's Company C, 3rd Artillery, Braxton Bragg's Company E, 3rd Artillery, and John M. Washington's Company B, 4th Artillery. The first three were assigned to Zachary Taylor's army from the start, while Washington joined Taylor later. The standard mixed light artillery battery included four 6-pounder field guns and two 12-pounder howitzers. Duncan joined Taylor's army in the military occupation Texas in 1845‚Äì46. On July 31 1845, the first echelon of Taylor's army landed at Corpus Christi, Texas. After months in camp, the first elements of the American army set out for Port Isabel, Texas which would serve as the forward base. Duncan's promotion to captain came through on April 16, 1846. On May 8, 1846, Taylor's army met the Mexican army of Mariano Arista in the Battle of Palo Alto. Duncan's battery was posted on the American left flank while Ringgold's battery was on the right. In the center stood two heavy 18-pounder cannons. Opposing the 2,228 Americans were 3,826 Mexicans with two 8-pounders and at least six 4-pounders. Duncan's and Ringgold's batteries deployed in front of the American infantry line and about from the Mexican defenders. Though many rounds overshot their targets, the effect of the American artillery fire was murderous. Meanwhile, the U.S. infantrymen were largely spectators to the artillery duel. Late in the afternoon, the Mexicans launched an infantry and cavalry attack against the American left wing, but it was repulsed by Duncan's battery. Though the battle ended inconclusively, the Americans lost only five killed, 43 wounded, and two missing. Ten more later died of their wounds including Ringgold who was struck in both legs by a 4-pounder shot. Arista reported 102 killed in his official report, but privately admitted losing 252 men killed. After finding the Mexican army gone the next morning, Taylor held a council of war in which seven of ten officers voted to wait for reinforcements, Taylor brushed their objections aside and ordered the army to advance. According to one account, Duncan was one of the three officers voting to advance. In another account, Taylor encountered Duncan who remarked, \\"General, we whipped them yesterday and we can whip them again\\". Unknown to the Americans, the Mexican soldiers were demoralized by their heavy casualties. In the Battle of Resaca de la Palma on May 9, the Americans routed the Mexican army. The Americans sustained losses of 34 killed and 113 wounded, but Mexican casualties were much heavier and included seven artillery pieces. Duncan was breveted major for \\"gallant conduct\\" at Palo Alto and breveted lieutenant colonel for \\"gallant and highly distinguished conduct\\" at Resaca de la Palma. =Invasion of Mexico= Battle of Molino del Rey map shows the three positions (F) assumed by Duncan's battery. During the Battle of Monterrey on September 21-24, 1846, Duncan's battery was assigned to Thomas Staniford's brigade in William J. Worth's division. Taylor attacked the city from the north, while sending Worth's troops to attack from the west. The batteries of Duncan and William W. Mackall were involved in the capture of the Bishop's Palace on September 22. Duncan was breveted colonel for \\"gallant and meritorious conduct\\" at Monterrey. In early January 1847, Taylor was ordered to transfer Worth's and Twiggs's divisions and two batteries, including Duncan's, to the army of Winfield Scott. Duncan fought at the Siege of Veracruz on March 9‚Äì29, 1847, at the Battle of Cerro Gordo on April 17‚Äì18, and at a skirmish in Amazoque on May 14. Scott's army was organized into four divisions, with Duncan's battery in Worth's 1st Division. As the American army approached Mexico City from the east, Scott ordered Worth to reconnoiter a road that would lead the Americans to attack from the south. Worth gave the task to Duncan who reported the road, \\"not easily obstructed or defended\\". Soon Scott's entire army moved by that route. At the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, 1847, Newman S. Clarke's brigade, George Cadwalader's brigade, and Duncan's battery captured the t√™te de pont, a strongpoint defended by a superior force. They then helped capture the San Mateo Convent. After a two-week truce, the Battle of Molino del Rey was fought on September 8, 1847. Underestimating the strength of the Mexican position, Scott assigned the task of capturing the Molino to Worth's reinforced division, a total of 3,500 men. Worth's soldiers were guided into position by Duncan and James Mason, who had reconnoitered the area. Worth deployed John Garland's brigade and Benjamin Huger's battery on the right, facing the Molino. Worth posted Clarke's brigade and Edwin Vose Sumner's 270 dragoons on the left, facing the Casa Mata fortification. Duncan's battery took position in the center and Cadwalader's brigade was in reserve. The initial American assault was repulsed with serious losses, but Garland's troops eventually overran the Molino. Meanwhile, the Mexican defenders of the Casa Mata drove back Clarke's brigade. A force of Mexican cavalry and infantry appeared to the west, but it was driven off by the fire of Duncan's guns and pursued by Sumner's dragoons. The Casa Mata repelled a second assault, but its defenders finally fled after a sustained bombardment by Duncan's battery. Duncan fought during the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1846, and during the subsequent capture of the Bel√©n and San Cosme gates on September 13‚Äì14. During the occupation of the Mexican capital, a quarrel occurred between the American generals. Gideon Pillow, one of the U.S. division commanders, published an article that appeared in the New Orleans Delta and Picayune newspapers under the pseudonym \\"Leonidas\\". The letter claimed Pillow was responsible for the American victories while Scott was mostly a bystander. Everyone immediately guessed that Pillow was the author. On October 23, the Pittsburgh Post published a letter claiming that Worth and Duncan saved Scott from a blunder by convincing the commander-in-chief to use the southern approach to Mexico City. Actually, Duncan wrote a letter to a friend and this was the basis for the Pittsburgh letter. Duncan later took credit for the letter. This was followed by a second letter praising Pillow in glowing terms. At first, Scott tolerated Pillow's unruly behavior, but he finally had enough and brought charges of insubordination against Pillow, Worth, and Duncan. Post-war The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848, and Scott was recalled soon afterward, leaving Mexico in April. The court of inquiry was begun in Mexico City but was later transferred to Frederick, Maryland where Pillow was eventually acquitted. Duncan's reputation was not damaged. President James K. Polk appointed him full colonel inspector general on January 26, 1849. While inspecting troops in Mobile, Alabama, Duncan caught yellow fever and died on July 3, 1849. On March 27, 1849, Captain Sidney Burbank established Fort Duncan at Eagle Pass, Texas. Named after Duncan, it was used intermittently by the U.S. Army until sold to the city of Eagle Pass in 1938.

It was one of the first and one of the largest of 152 military works known as the Lines of Torres Vedras that were built in 1809-10 to defend Lisbon during the Peninsular War (1807-14). The fort played a major role in stopping the advance of Napoleonic troops. History Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roli√ßa and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. However, the threat of further invasions by the French led Wellington, on October 20, 1809, to order the construction of defensive lines in order to protect Lisbon from Napol√©on Bonaparte's troops and also to provide a route for his own evacuation should it be necessary. Work on the Fort of Alqueid√£o, as part of the first Line of defence, began on November 8, 1809, at more or less the same time as improvements to the Fort of S√£o Juli√£o da Barra, close to Lisbon, and construction of the new Fort of S√£o Vicente at Torres Vedras, under the overall supervision of Colonel Richard Fletcher who was commander of the Royal Engineers. By October of the following year 126 forts, redoubts and other defences forming three lines of defence had been constructed over 80 kilometres, reinforcing the natural obstacles that the land offered and making maximum use of the existing topography. A new French invasion was headed by Marechal Mass√©na. He was defeated in September 1810 by the Anglo-Portuguese army commanded by Wellington at the Battle of Bu√ßaco. Despite this he forced the allies to retreat to the Lines of Torres Vedras, where a stalemate ensued for several months. Mass√©na‚Äôs troops were gathered around Sobral de Monte Agra√ßo but he found the line of defences, centered on the Fort of Alqueid√£o, to be impregnable. He eventually had to retreat due to lack of food and supplies, withdrawing to the Spanish border. However, works on the Lines continued after the French withdrawal, with 152 works eventually being completed. The fort is at 439 meters above sea level, on top of the Monte Agra√ßo mountain range, and occupies an area of 3.5 hectares. It was part of a group of seven forts and redoubts in the 2nd section or district of the first of the Lines of Torres Vedras and designated No. 14 in the numbering system used for all of the works carried out on the lines. Work on Alqueid√£o began on 4 November 1809.Wellington‚Äôs headquarters were close by in the village of P√™ro Negro, and, because of its commanding position, the fort served as the command post for the Lines. Using an optical telegraph signalling system, the fort could communicate with the Fort of Archeira to the south of Torres Vedras and from there to both the Fort of S√£o Vicente to the north of the same town and the Atlantic coast. Part of the original road used to supply the fort The Fort of Alqueid√£o had a garrison of 1,590 men, and was equipped with 24 cannon, believed to be 14 12-pounder artillery, six 9-pouders, and four 6-pounders. The troops were Portuguese, under the command of the British Brigadier-General Denis Pack, together with two artillery companies from Sobral formed and trained by William Beresford who was both a general in the British army and a marshal of the Portuguese army. The present day As part of a programme of restoration to celebrate the bicentennial of the Lines, archaeological exploration was carried out between 2008 and 2011, using EEA and Norway Grants. This resulted in the identification of the sites of the Governor‚Äôs Barracks, a warehouse, a cistern, and armories. The archaeological studies not only added to the understanding of the construction techniques used but also discovered that the site had been first occupied during the Iron Age. Restoration work at the same time included removing trees so that the commanding position of the fort could better be appreciated. In addition a concrete viewing platform was added, highlighting locations of other forts in the Lines. Neighbouring forts In the immediate vicinity of the Fort of Alqueid√£o are three other forts, Machado, Novo, and Simpl√≠cio, which exchanged crossfire with the Fort of Alqueid√£o and were connected by a military road that allowed the circulation of people and goods. The Fort of Simpl√≠cio: powder magazine =Fort of Simpl√≠cio= The Fort of Simpl√≠cio (Number 16) was the closest of the three forts to Alqueid√£o, a short distance to its south. It had a garrison of 300 men, with seven cannon and one howitzer. It was particularly well-sited to bombard the French troops from their rear should they break through and start to march in the direction of Lisbon. =Fort of Machado= Southwest of the Fort of Alqueid√£o, the Fort of Machado (Number 17) had room for 460 soldiers and was equipped with three 12-pounder cannon, three 9-pounders and one 6-pounder.

The first known Lord of Westerlo was the Frankish nobleman Ansfried of Utrecht who gave this domain as allodial title to the chapters of Saint-Martin and Saint-Salvator in Utrecht after he became Bishop of Utrecht in 995. Since the late 15th century the Lords of Westerlo have been members of the House of Merode. In 1626 Westerlo was elevated to the rank of marquessate by King Philip IV of Spain in favor of Philippe I de Merode who became the first Marquess of Westerlo. The chief of the House of Merode stil bears the title of Marquess of Westerlo although the feudal rights attached to this title have been abolished since 1795. In the nineteenth and first halve of the twentieth century the 10th, 11th and 12th Marquess have been elected Burgomaster of Westerlo. The donation of Ansfried of Utrecht The exact date of the donation (which included apart from Westerlo proper, the nearby domains of Olen, Westmeerbeek, Buul and others) is not known. The original charter has not been preserved and is only known in medieval copies of the 12th century.Brussels, Algemeen Rijksarchief, FAMW, LA 1335, Copy of the donation charter from the register of the Chapter Church of Oudmunster in Utrecht, Translation in Middle Dutch from the 12th century ; Utrecht, Bischoppelijk Archief, Cartularium from the Liber Donationum, no. 43, fol. 25, 12th century copy of the original Latin text It can be supposed that the donation took place at some time between 995 when he became bishop of Utrecht and his death in 1010. The donation was intended to provide the chapters of Sint-Maarten and Sint-Salvator with the necessary financial means to organise the religious service.Eduard van Ermen, De Utrechtse kapittels Sint-Maarten en Sint-Salvator (Oudmunster) en hun bezittingen in de Antwerpse Kempen, Leuven, 1983, pp.28‚Äì51 The mysterious House of Westerlo and the House of Wezemaal The chapter of Utrecht gave the manor of Westerlo in fief to local Brabantic noble families. There are indications that in the 11th and 12th centuries a further unknown family by the name of 'van Westerlo' held the fief.Kris De Winter, Westerlo, land van Merode, Westerlo, 2000, p.12 The knights of WezemaalThe archaic spelling 'Wesemael' or 'Wesemaele' is mostly seen in older texts and is still commonly used in French texts. however where gaining power and influence through the important functions they held at the court of the Duke of Brabant. The office of Hereditary Marshall of Brabant brought them great prestige. A certain Hildebrand van Westerlo was mentioned for the last time before 1206 to act as a witness together with Arnold I of Wezemaal. It seems that by 1233‚Äì34 his successor Arnold II was in full control of the fief. The oldest preserved lease contract between Arnold II and the chapter of Utrecht dates from 1247. He and his descendants will bear the title Lord of Westerlo.Eduard van Ermen, De landelijke bezittingen van de heren van Wezemaal in de Middeleeuwen, 2 vols., Leuven, 1982‚Äì1986 After the death of the father the heir had to present himself before the chapter in Utrecht and renew his oath of fealty.De Winter 2000, p. 15 Coat of Arms of the House of Wezemaal The subsequent Lords of Westerlo from the House of Wezemaal are: Arnold I van Wezemaal (fl. ca. 1170‚Äì1200) ** Arnold II van Wezemaal (+before 1264) x 1 Beatrijs van Breda x 2 Aleidis van Brabant (daughter of Henry I, Duke of Brabant) *** Arnold III van Wezemaal *** Godfried van Wezemaal (+before 1274) x Isentrudis van Alphen **** Arnold IV van Wezemaal (+1302 in the Battle of the Golden Spurs) x Ida van Bierbeek ***** Arnold V van Wezemaal (+1317) Dies without heirs. ***** Willem I van Wezemaal (+before 1367) x Jeanne de Beaufort-Fallais ****** Willem II van Wezemaal (+1372) Dies without heirs. ****** Margaretha van Wezemaal x Richard I de Merode ****** Jan I van Wezemaal (+1417) x 1 Ida van Ranst x 2 Jeanne de Bauffremont (+1429) ******* Jan II van Wezemaal (+1467) Dies without legitimate heirs. x Johanna van Bouchout Westerlo disputed between Wezemaal and Merode Margaretha van Wezemaal (+1393), sister of Jan I van Wezemaal (+1417), Lord of Westerlo, married Richard I de Merode (+1398) in 1361. At this point the House of Merode appears for the first time in the history of Westerlo. Jan I was a canon in Utrecht before marrying Ida van Berchem, widow of the knight Jan van Lier who was believed to have died in combat. After some time the marriage was declared void on the basis of rumors that Ida's first husband Jan van Lier was still alive. After she had been his concubine for some time Jan I finally married Jeanne de Beauffremont. This legitimated the position of their son Jan II who had been born before the union took place. The Brabantic nobility and the Papal authorities in both Rome and Avignon recognized Jan II in 1417 as his fathers legal heir.De Winter 2000, pp.27‚Äì28 But the children of Richard I de Merode and Margaretha van Wezemaal proclaimed themselves as the sole legitimate heirs and considered their cousin Jan a bastard. The chapter of Utrecht was inclined to follow this point of view. They hesitated to give him Westerlo and Olen in fief and instead negotiated with his cousin Richard II de Merode. The lease contract with Jan II was not renewed but he refused to leave the fief and did not pay the lease. His cousin Richard II could close a lease contract with the chapter and did pay the lease in place of his cousin, although he had no acces to the fief and its revenues. As the land of Westerlo was in the middle of the Duchy of Brabant and far removed from the influence of the chapter of Utrecht, Jan II could hold his position as long as he had the support of the Dukes of Brabant.Van Ermen 1982‚Äì1986, vol.II, pp. 44‚Äì53, Meanwhile the Duchy had become part of the territories ruled by the House of Valois-Burgundy which was keen to expand its power and influence wherever it could. Jan II ignored the allodial rights of the chapter of Utrecht and left Westerlo in his will to the Duke of Brabant, Charles the Bold. However de facto illegal, the Duke accepted the inheritance ignoring in his turn the property rights of the chapter of Utrecht. Guy de Brimeu in Westerlo Guy de Brimeu in the Armorial of the Order of the Golden Fleece (The Hague, KB, 76 E 10, fol. 75v) As if Westerlo was an integral part of his Duchy, Charles the Bold immediately sold (1474) the 'Seigneurie' and the Castle of Westerlo together with others goods and titles of the Lords of Wesemael to Guy de Brimeu, Lord of Humbercourt.Van Ermen 1982‚Äì1986, vol.II, p.111 De Brimeu was one of Charles the Bold's leading councillors and a knight in the prestigious Order of the Golden Fleece.Werner Paravicini, Guy de Brimeu, Der Burgundische Staat und seine adlige F√ºhrungsschicht unter Karl dem K√ºhnen, Bonn, 1975, passim There is evidence Guy de Brimeu lived in the Castle of Westerlo for a longer period of time between 1475 and his death in 1477. The fief also seems to have been an important source of income for Brimeu.Paravicini 1975, p.364, 412 and pp.418‚Äì421 After the sudden death of Charles the Bold, de Brimeu was executed in Ghent on accusation of having negotiated in secret with Louis XI of France over the succession of Charles' daughter Mary of Burgundy. The House of Merode The House of Merode immediately started a legal procedure against Antonia de Rambures, widow of Guy de Brimeu. On the 29th of March 1484 the Council of Brabant recognized the fact that the fiefs of Westerlo and Olen were the full property of the chapter of Utrecht.De Winter 2000, p.30 The House of Merode had been paying the lease to the chapter for decades. This made the position of the widow de Brimeu no longer tenable. In 1488 she and her heirs came to an agreement with Jan II de Merode.Brussels, Algemeen Rijksarchief, Charter of April 14th 1488; Agreement between Jan II de Merode and the widow and children of Guy de Brimeu concerning the land of Westerlo, Brussels, Council of Brabant, April 15th 1488 After decades of struggle he finally became in the possession of the land of Westerlo. Until 1617 Westerlo would remain a fief of the chapter of Utrecht held by the House of Merode.Vannoppen 1989, p.41 As a result of the Dutch Revolt in that year the Roman Catholic chapter of Utrecht formally seized to exist and Westerlo would become a fief of the Duchy of Brabant. The subsequent Lords of Westerlo from the house of Merode are: * Jan (Jean) II de Merode (+1497) x Marguerite de Melun (+1532) to their son: * Jan III de Merode (1496‚Äì1550) x Anne van Gistel- Dudzele (+1534) without issue. Jan III designated in his will his nephew Hendrik (Henri) as his heir: * Hendrik de Merode (1505‚Äì1564) x Fran√ßoise van Brederode (+1533) The will was contested by Richard de Merode-Houffalize, of the branch of the Lords of Frentz who was married to Johanna de Merode, Hendrik's elder sister. The Council of Brabant supported Hendrik while the Chapter of Utrecht was in favor of the claims of Richard. It would take 8 years until the dispute was settled in favor of Hendrik de Merode.De Winter 2000 p.55 & note 1 with references to the archival documents At his death he was succeeded by his son; * Jan IV de Merode (+1601) x Mencia de Glimes- Berghes x Margaretha van Pallant. To their son: * Philips I de Merode (1568‚Äì1627) x Anna de Merode-Houffalize (+1625) The Marquess of Westerlo In 1626 Westerlo is elevated to the rank of marquessate by Philip IV of Spain, Duke of Brabant. Philip I de Merode becomes the first Marquess of Westerlo. At his death the next year the land and the titles are inherited by his son: * Florent I de Merode (1598‚Äì1638) second Marquess of Westerlo x Anna-Sidonia van Bronckhorst-Batenburg-Stein (+1596).

The end of the marquessate of Westerlo Karel-Willem (Charles-Guillaume) would be the last feudal Marquess of Westerlo.E. Duchesne, 'Charles-Guillaume-Ghislain comte de M√©rode', Biographie Nationale, vol.XIV, col.534‚Äì539 With the annexation of the Austrian Netherlands to the First French Republic on the first of October 1795 feodality was definitively abolished. The marquessate of Westerlo seized to exist and was divided in municipalities.Henri Vannoppen, Het kasteel van Westerlo en de Prinsen de Merode,Westerlo, 1989, p.71-74 The Merode Family lived in exile in Maastricht and later in Prussia and Saxony. The country estate and extensive domains in the region were confiscated by the Republic and put on sale. They could be bought back by agents acting on behalf of the exiled family. Karel-Willem and his family returned to Belgium in 1800. The title of 'Marquess of Westerlo' was recognized by King William I of the Netherlands in 1823 and will be inherited by his eldest son: * Count Henri de Merode-Westerloo (1762‚Äì1846) ninth Marquess of Westerlo x Louise de Thesan d'Espendaillan (1787‚Äì1862).

They also finished as runners-up in the Highlands Regional League on two occasions. The club is currently taking part in the 2019 edition of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, and are through to the playoffs after having finished second in the Highlands Conference.  History  The first records of the club playing competitively was in the 1997 Papua New Guinea National Club Championship. However, the side failed to make an impact on the competition. The club also took part in the 1998 edition, but also failed to make the knockout stages. In 1999, the club took part in the Highlands Regional League and topped their pool. It is unclear whether the side won the competition. However, in 2001, the side returned, and were beaten in the final by Momads. This fate was repeated four years later when the side fell 3‚Äì1 against Momads in the Grand Final. The two sides were due to play in the following season's final on 21 May 2006, but the match was abandoned at half- time due to bad light and never rescheduled. Later that year, the club took part in the Papua New Guinea National Club Championship for the second time. They placed bottom of their pool behind Sobou FC, University and West United. The side reached the 2008 Highlands Regional League final for the fourth time, where they were set to play Momads again. However, the match was not played due to an appeal over the eligibility of some of the Momads team ‚Äì now operating under the name of Welgris Highlanders ‚Äì having played in the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League earlier in the season. The side's competitive record is unclear until late 2018, when it was confirmed they would be competing in the 2019 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League in the Highlands Conference. The side had a slow start to the competition, drawing 1‚Äì1 with Simbu Angra on the opening day, before a 4‚Äì2 win over Aporo Mai was followed by a 3‚Äì0 defeat at the hands of Mount Hagen FC. A win against Enga Laima was followed by a defeat to unbeaten leaders Kagua Erave, leaving the side third on seven points at the halfway stage, three behind Mount Hagen in second. A 2‚Äì0 reverse victory against Mount Hagen on 23 March was enough to draw them level with their local rivals, and two wins from their next four ‚Äì including an incredible 10‚Äì4 victory against Simbu Angra which helped them overturn their goal difference deficit ‚Äì was enough to qualify them for the next round in second place behind Kagua Erave.

He is best remembered as a scholar, merchant, traveler, pioneer explorer and diplomat. At a young age, he settled in Moscow, from where he travelled to Iran on several occasions. He eventually became acquainted with Nader-Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah; 1736‚Äì1747) and spent considerable time close to him. Vatatzes wrote a biography in Greek about Nader Shah, known as the Persika, an important work which provides information about Iran in the 1720s, 1730s and 1740s. He also wrote a travel account, the Periegetikon, and drew a map. According to Evangelos Venetis, Vatatzes was \\"an admirer of Persian civilization and of Nader Shah's rule\\" and an \\"important author for Iranian history and Hellenic-Iranian studies\\". However, his works \\"have been largely ignored by modern scholarship\\". Biography Vasileios Vatatzes was born in Therapeia near Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire and was a scion of the Vatatzes noble family. His father was a Greek Orthodox priest who served at the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, and he had five siblings. At the age of fourteen, Vatatzes moved to Moscow in the Tsardom of Russia where he became a merchant. In the subsequent period, he visited Safavid Iran on no less than three occasions. In 1713, he visited Derbent (Darband) and Shamakhi in the Safavid province of Shirvan. Three years later, in 1716, he once again went to Shirvan and from there he travelled further to Rasht in Gilan, Qazvin, Saveh, Qom, Kashan and the Safavid royal capital of Isfahan. He returned to Moscow through Ardabil, Derbent and Astrakhan. Several years later, in 1727/8, he once again visited Iran through Astrakhan, the Aral Sea, Khiva, and Bukhara. During this particular trip, he stayed at Mashhad, Mazandaran (Sari, Babol) and Gilan (Rasht). He also became acquainted with Nader-Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah; ). During his stay at Mashhad, Vatatzes delivered a message from Nader to the Russian force which occupied Rasht, commanded by General Vasily Levasov. According to the modern historian Evangelos Venetis, Vatatzes had traveled to Prussia, the Kingdom of France, the Dutch Republic, Great Britain and Denmark by 1732/3. Post-1733 information about Vatatzes's life remains obscure. Venetis notes that in all likelihood, according to Vatatzes's own writings, he \\"spent much time in the court of Nader Shah, accumulating all necessary information before compiling Nader Shah's biography\\". In addition to spending much time at court, he also participated in Nader's military expeditions. In 1748, Vatatzes completed Nader's biography (known as the Persika) in Greek. Vatatzes was proficient in Persian and also drew a map. According to Venetis, Vatatzes \\"was associated with the 18th-century Greek Enlightenment of the Danubian Principalities\\". Venetis adds that Vatatzes either wrote his manuscripts at the court of the Greek Phanariote rulers of the Danubian Principalities or they were reproduced there in large quantities after his death. Anyhow, in all likelihood, Vatatzes was a member of the retinue of the Phanariote rulers. Venetis adds that Vatatzes was \\"an admirer of Persian civilization and of Nader Shah's rule\\" and an \\"important author for Iranian history and Hellenic-Iranian studies\\". However, his works \\"have been largely ignored by modern scholarship\\".

December 17, 1970) is a professional Spanish big wall climber, explorer and alpinist from Barcelona, Spain. She is particularly known for her big wall soloing accomplishments in remote mountain regions of Pakistan, India, Patagonia and Alaska.  Early life  Vidal was born in Barcelona, Spain. At 24, as a university student, Vidal was an athletics athlete and studying PE when she got involved with competing in a multi-sport athletic event. One of the included sports was climbing and Vidal became interested, noting that \\"this was something different because before that I was doing athletics and running a lot and this became the first time I touched the rock.\\" Vidal's initial climbing education consisted of trad climbing on multi-pitch big wall climbs, primarily because that was what her friends were doing. Within a year, she was climbing up to A5, but didn't try her first sport climbing pitch until her she had been trad climbing for over a year.  Climbing accomplishments  After climbing for just two years, Vidal received the Piolet d'Oro award from the Spanish Mountain Federation for her 1996 climb, Principado de Asturias (A4) in Northern Spain. By the mid-nineties, Vidal had gained experience in both European climbing hot spots, like Montserrat and in Yosemite Valley of California. In August, 1999, Vidal, with partners Pep Masip and Miguel Puigdomenech, made the first ascent of Sol Solet on Amin Brakk, a 5800m tower in the Nangma Valley of Karakoram, Pakistan. The tower was named after the expedition's Spanish cook, whose first name was Amin. In 2001, the American Alpine Journal singled out the team's climb as a notable example of a \\"particularly impressive endurance test.\\" The climbers spent a continuous 32 days on the wall, with climbing difficulty up to A5. In the end, the climbers placed only 31 bolts, with 27 clumped on a completely blank wall section. In September, 2004, Vidal and partner Eloi Callado established a new, 890m route, Mai Blau (A3+) on Neverseen Tower in the Indian Himalya. In July, 2007, Vidal made a solo expedition back to Karakoram, Pakistan and put up a huge, 2900ft solo route, Life is Lilac, on the Shipton Spire. Vidal spent 21 continuous days alone on the wall, with difficulty grades of A4+. In February and March, 2012, in another solo expedition, Vidal established Espiadimonis, a 1500m A4 route on Serrania Avalancha in Chilean Patagonia. Vidal spent 32 continuous days alone on the wall after bush-wacking through jungle to reach the area and set up base camp. Wet conditions necessitated 16 completely inactive days lying in the portaledge. The rainy conditions created waterfall-like effects along the face of the wall, so Vidal was nearly always soaked and \\"felt like I was in a swimming pool\\". In July, 2017, Vidal established Un pas m√©s (A4+) on the west face of Xanadu, a mountain in the Arrigetch Peaks of Alaska.  Climbing style and philosophy  Vidal is widely-known within the climbing community for soloing hard aid routes in remote and difficult-to-reach regions of the world. Vidal favors an independent, labor-intensive approach to expeditions, doing much of the research, preparation and gear hauling herself. Vidal says \\"to plan a big wall expedition in remote places requires complex logistics. First, you have to inform yourself as much as possible about the place you are going, because most of the ascents I have done are in places with unclimbed walls, without any information. To prepare the logistics of the equipment and decide what you should take is a handicap.\\" On solo expeditions, Vidal avoids bringing any means of communication with the outside world, including radio, phone or any internet connection. In remote areas, Vidal sometimes explores without maps or GPS and has to navigate the approach \\"by intuition\\". Vidal is a proponent of an arduous, personal style of exploration that often includes hauling all of her own gear in extremely remote and challenging conditions. For example, in 2017, the climber spent 53 total days alone in the Alaskan Arrigetch range, 36 of which were spent hauling equipment and food, and 17 days of climbing. PlanetMountain wrote that \\"in many respects the actual climbing was the least demanding part of the entire trip. A staggering 36 days, for instance, were spent hauling the 150 kilos of food and gear needed for the 53 days she spent alone in the remote Alaskan valley.\\" Vidal notes that \\"normally numbers are what counts: what have you done, how many meters, what grade--That's relevant and important, too, but from my view it is equally important to see how things were done. To go in that style is a way of saying 'I am really alone.' If I go alone, I am alone.\\" Although Vidal prefers this style, she does not believe that other climbing styles are less laudable, simply that this is the path she has chosen. Vidal has been a proponent for treating male and female climbers equally in terms of evaluating their accomplishments, believing that men and women are both capable of feats of equal magnitude in mountaineering, climbing and exploring. \\"If someone congratulates me as the first woman to open a new route on Shipton Spire by herself, that person is underrating my accomplishment,\\" she wrote.  Personal life  While Vidal has had multiple climbing sponsorships over the years, these have not always been consistent. She had to self-fund her 2007 expedition to the Karakoram because of problems with her sponsor, and in the past supplemented her income with jobs installing the electrical cables in windmills. Vidal's trips are extremely physically demanding, often requiring up to six months of post-trip recovery time. During periods between expeditions, she gives presentations and motivation talks about her accomplishments.

The holotype was described by Alder & Hancock in 1854 from Herm in the Channel Islands, but the nudibranch has since been detected in other parts of the British Isles. It was originally given the name Eolis glaucoides but has since been transferred to the genus Calma. It is an egg predator, feeding on the eggs of fish and cephalopods. Description Calma glaucoides grows to a length of about . The body is white and translucent; the head is small, the oral tentacles are small and smooth, and the branchial process is almost linear, being white fringed with yellow. The central part of the body is depressed and the central gland is a brownish colour. The cerata are arranged in eleven clusters, each sharing a common pedicle. Distribution and habitat Native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, C. glaucoides is found on the coasts of the British Isles, the Channel Islands, France and Spain. It occurs in the littoral zone on rocky coasts, under stones and boulders, and often in association with hydroids. Ecology Nudibranchs are hermaphrodite, and two individuals mate and transfer spermatophores to each other. The eggs are laid in a ribbon-like gelatinous coil and attached to the substrate. All nudibranchs are carnivorous, and Calma glaucoides specifically is an egg predator. Its small size and creamy white colour provides camouflage while it is feeding on the pale-coloured eggs of teleost fish and cephalopods. Examination of the gut contents shows that this species sometimes consumes its own juveniles. So rich and nourishing is its diet that the gut does not have an anal opening, presumably because the food produces so little residue; however, the larval stage does have an anus.

Biography  Charles was born to Mary Eastman in Cedar Rapids Iowa on June 5, 1868, his father was Austin Eastman. His higher education progressed from work at Harvard to Johns Hopkins universities, then travelled to Munich in 1892 to complete a PhD in 1894. He married Caroline A Clark, one of three daughters of Alvan G. Clark; her father was a manufacturer of high quality telescopes who made several astronomical discoveries. Charles Eastman and his wife resided at one of several large houses surrounding the successful Clark company's workshop. He was reported as drowned at Long Beach in New York on September 27, 1918. The New York Times noted the cause of death as presumed to be the result of overwork for the War Trade Board while recovering after the influenza outbreak known as Spanish flu, and that he had fallen into the sea fully clothed after fainting at the end of a boardwalk.  Works  Eastman's works included geology, and was employed by the New England USGS, but his interest in fossil and modern fish remained the focus throughout his career. Including his submissions to geological surveys, his list publications numbers over one hundred. He was curator at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and later at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum. His early studies and interests included the placoderms. While in Germany he examined a collection of fossil teeth from the \\"Chalk Measures shark\\", he later translated a palaeontology text from the German language. While spending six months in prison, awaiting trial for murder, Eastman continued with his research and studies.

It is situated 5 km south of Falkirk and about 4 km east of Cumbernauld, at around 170 m above sea level. The area is a mosaic of improved grasslands and rough pasture which includes wetlands dominated by Juncus species (rushes), raised, blanket and intermediate bogs and two shallow lochs within Fannyside Muir. The area attracts a nationally important population of taiga bean geese (Anser fabalis fabalis). The area became an area of special scientific interest on 5 September 2007 due to the Slamannan Plateau becoming the primary site for wintering taiga bean geese in the UK with over 50% of the total population in recent years. The majority of the rest of the UK population winters in Norfolk with occasional small flocks elsewhere. The geese feed, mostly by day, on agricultural fields mainly eating grasses. In the early evening they fly to their roost sites, or if the weather is bad they can roost within their preferred feeding fields.

File:Shish Gumbad in Lodhi garden 12.jpg The Delhi Sultanate ruled the city between 1206 and 1526. Their rule saw the development of early Indo-Islamic architecture, the most prominent being the Qutb complex, a group of monuments surrounding the Qutb Minar. This period also saw building of many forts and cities like Siri Fort, Tughlaqabad and Feroz Shah Kotla. Many tombs were built around this period which are still present in many locations like Qutb Complex, Hauz Khas Complex and Lodi Gardens.  Mughal Empire  File:Red Fort in Delhi 03-2016 img3.jpgThe Red Fort was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century, it was the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.

File:Jama Masjid - In the Noon.jpgThe Jama Masjid is one of the largest mosques in India. File:Tomb of Safdarjung.jpgSafdarjung's Tomb was built in 1754 in the late Mughal architectural style for Nawab Safdarjung. Mughal Architecture emerged as a form of Indo-Islamic architecture during the rule of the Mughal Empire. Mughal architecture is characterized by large bulbous onion domes, the use of white marble and red sandstone, delicate ornamentation work, and large buildings surrounded by gardens on all four sides. The Humayun's Tomb is the first notable example of Mughal architecture in Delhi. Except for a few architectures like Humayun's Tomb and Purana Qila, most of the architectural work of this period was done in Shah Jahan's time or later. This period also saw building of 18th century Astronomical Observatory called Jantar Mantar. Another important achievement of this period was building of Mughal gardens. Its design was inspired by persian Char Bagh Gardens. Some gardens built during Mughal period are garden built in front of Humayun's Tomb, Roshanara Bagh, Qudsia Bagh and Garden built in Safdarjang's tomb complex.  British Colonial period  File:St. James Church 9.jpgSt. James' Church was designed in the Renaissance Revival style and completed in 1836.

It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1929. File:Connaught Place New Delhi.jpgConnaught Place was designed in the Georgian style by Robert Tor Russell, and completed in 1933. After Delhi was declared the site for a new capital of India, George V laid the foundation of New Delhi, which would serve as the capital. The British invited Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker to design the government buildings. This area would also be called Lutyens' Delhi in honor of the architect. Members of Lutyens' team of architects included Walter Sykes George, Arthur Gordon Shoosmith and Henry Medd. It is reported that Lutyens was reluctant to incorporate Indian features in his style, but later conceded.  Post- Independence  File:Supreme_Court_of_India,_inside_bulidings_01_(cropped).jpgThe Supreme Court of India was designed by Ganesh Bhikaji Deoalikar and completed in 1958. Its style was inspired by the Lutyens-Baker buildings.

It was demolished in 2017, despite several protests.

However, modernist architecture became prevalent in Delhi as well as all over India, especially after the influence of Le Corbusier. After Independence, the best examples of modern architecture in Delhi include IIT Delhi (1961) by Jugal Kishore Chodhury, Hall of Nations (1972) and Asian Games Village (1982) by Raj Rewal, Palika Kendra building (1984) by Kuldip Singh, and Lotus Temple (1986) by Fariborhz Sahba. In 2017, the demolition of the Hall of Nations received worldwide condemnation from architectural enthusiasts. It was considered to be one of the best examples of modernist architecture in India.

Plot An Englishman, who lectures at Aberdeen University, goes missing, with only spattered blood stains to indicate what might have happened. He was vociferous in his Unionism (especially on social media) and it is thought by Police Scotland that the Alt-Nats (Alternative Nationalists) have kidnapped him. Then at least two others go missing too. Amidst all this, Detective Inspector Logan McRae is back at work after having had a year off on sick leave (on account of his wounds from the last story The Blood Road). McRae, who is still in Professional Standards, is seconded to the investigation into the disappearances when it is revealed that the detective inspector leading the investigation, was in a Nationalist terror group when he was sixteen. Reception MacBride acknowledged that the novel had an obvious theme; that of Scotland's Independence and the fight between the Nationalists and the Unionists. MacBride stated his thoughts on the matter, saying Barry Forshaw, writing in the \\"Financial Times\\", commented on the Scottish Independence theme on the book and stated \\"...while the delivery of such elements in All That‚Äôs Dead may seem less compulsively nasty than previous outings for his rough- edged Aberdeen copper Logan McRae, readers should not be lured into a false sense of security.\\" Louise Fairbairn, writing in \\"The Scotsman\\", said \\"After last year‚Äôs superlative The Blood Road, I wondered what Stuart MacBride was going to do next.

Sidney attended South Whidbey High School where Chris Harshman as band director created an environment in which Hauser's interest and musical ability flourished, studying both clarinet and saxophone. During her senior year of high school in 2012, Sidney received best alto saxophone soloist award at the Bellevue College performing Georgia on My Mind http://www.southwhidbeyrecord.com/news/south-whidbey-jazz-students- win-awards-at-bellevue-college-fest-kudos/ also played at The North Shore Jazz Festival-(this performance of Georgia on My Mind can be found on youtube), competing against musicians from Seattle high schools such as Garfield High School and Roosevelt High School. Sidney had the great pleasure of performing on stage with Joshua Redman at South Whidbey High School who was there in a teaching capacity. Sidney then performed \\"When Sunny Gets Blue\\" at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival in Moscow, Idaho at which she got into the first place as an alto saxophone soloist. After the win, Sidney began to transcribe jazz rhythms from Sonny Stitt, Joshua Redman, Art Pepper, and Cannonball Adderley. Sidney also studied under Neil Welch and Mark Taylor. Education and career After graduating from high school, Hauser auditioned and was accepted into the jazz program at the University of Washington. Although she took lessons with famous musicians such as Cuong Vu, Ted Poor, Bill Frisell and Marc Seales (who was her mentor at the time), Sidney took time away in an effort to find her jazz voice while continuing to exercise her artistry and was accepted into the University of Washington school of fine and visual arts. During this time Sidney continued to perform jazz in various venues in Seattle including performing with Seattle Women's Jazz Orchestra. In addition, Sidney spearheaded a band at this time which has now morphed into her current band SmackTalk often described as performing jazz funk fusion. Michael Brockman recognizing Sidney's talent invited her to fill the big shoes of Bill Ramsey who was retiring from the jazz community at the time. Hauser is often approached by audience members and budding musicians as a member of Seattle Repertory Jazz Orchestra (SRJO) who are inspired by her performances and inspired by her membership. Sidney has most recently recorded a video called BEAMS with her band SmackTalk (also available on youtube) and Sidney is looking forward to upcoming SRJO performances.

Persian King and the Defeated Enemies. Hermitage Museum It is the so-called \\"Zvenigorodsky seal\\", it was acquired in Kertch, and first appears in the 1881 Compte rendu de la Commission Imp√©riale Arch√©ologique pour l'Ann√©e 1881. Content The cylinder depicts an Achaemenid King of Kings holding a kneeling captive with a hand, and subjugating him with a spear held by the other hand. The kneeling captive wears an Egyptian crown. Behind the king there are four prisoners with a rope around their necks, the rope being held by the king himself. Their garment is similar to that of the Egyptians seen on the reliefs of Naqsh-e Rostam. The scene therefore refers to Ancient Egypt and to an act of conquest or the suppression of a rebellion by an Achaemenid king. It is generally thought that the seal depicts a Persian king or hero thrusting his lance at an Egyptian pharaoh, while holding four other captives on a rope.\\"a Persian hero slaughtering an Egyptian pharaoh while leading four other Egyptian captives\\"\\"Victor, apparently wearing the tall Persian headdress rather than a crown, leads four bareheaded Egyptian captives by a rope tied to his belt. Victor spears a figure wearing Egyptian type crown.\\" in \\"Another seal, also from Egypt, shows a Persian king, his left hand grasping an Egyptian with an Egyptian hairdo (pschent), whom he thrusts through with his lance while holding four prisoners with a rope around their necks.\\" A rather similar seal is known bearing the inscription \\"I am Artaxerxes the Great King\\" in cuneiform (the \\"Moscow Artaxerxes Cylinder Seal\\"): the Achaemenid king is shown leading the Egyptian captives on a rope, but the kneeling figure of the pharaoh is absent and replaced by the Old Persian cuneiform inscription. The inscription would suggest that the king in the seal is either Artaxerxes III, who reconquered Egypt, or more probably Artaxerxes I (r. 465-424 BC), who did put down a rebellion in Egypt, given the rather rigid execution of the engraving, which suggests an early date for its manufacture, probably closer to the time of Darius I. Seal of Darius the Great. British Museum. The seal has many similarities with the seal of Darius I (c. 550‚Äì486 BC), both in the rather rigid treatment of the figures, and in the composition of the seal itself. On these grounds, the manufacture of the Zvenigorodsky seal could be attributed to a period rather close to that of Darius I, which would favour an attribution to Artaxerxes I. Identification Similar scene from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Circa 6th‚Äì5th century BC. Another known example appears in Ancient Seals of the Near East, plaque 17.Ancient Seals of the Near East, plaque 17 All the characters on the cylinder are unnamed, thus making difficult to identify at least the two main figures. The Hermitage Museum indeed does not give any identification, yet it dates the seal to the late 5th‚Äìearly 4th century BCE. Nevertheless, several attempts to identify at least the Achaemenid ruler were made. In 1903, Gaston Maspero suggested that the scene depicts Darius the Great dealing with some rebels. In 1979, Muhammad Dandamayev opted for Artaxerxes II., pl.

It is recognized as such by the Court of the Lord Lyon, but as it does not currently have a chief recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms it is considered an armigerous clan. History =Origins of the clan= Although there are multiple lands in Scotland that are named Middleton, it is believed that the family took its name from those near to Laurencekirk in Kincardineshire. These lands were confirmed by a charter from William the Lion (c. 1142 ‚Äì 4 December 1214). In 1296, Humfrey de Middleton of Kincardyn appeared on the Ragman Rolls rendering homage to Edward I of England. Robert de Middleton was taken prisoner at Dunbar Castle in the same year. =17th century= The Middleton family came to prominence in the 17th century. John Middleton, son of Middleton of Coldham, was a professional soldier who served the king of France, in Hepburn's Regiment. In 1642 he returned to Scotland and supported the opponents of Charles I of England. Firstly, as a cavalry commander and later as a general. Middleton was with David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark's cavalry when they surprised and defeated James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose at the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645, pursuing him northwards. Middleton also negotiated the terms when Charles I surrendered for Montrose to take ship to the Continent. Middleton later joined forces with James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton in an attempt to rescue the king in 1648, but was taken prisoner after the Battle of Preston. He later escaped and re-joined the royalists only to be wounded and captured again at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He was tried for treason, but again escaped and joined Glencairn's rising, only to be defeated by George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, and went into exile again on the Continent. At The Restoration, Charles II of England created him Earl of Middleton as well as Lord Clermont and Fettercarin. He was later also created Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland and Governor of Tangier in 1667, where he died. His only son was Charles, the second and last Earl of Middleton who was ambassador to the imperial court of Vienna and Secretary of State for Scotland. Charles did not approve of the actions of James II of England and VII of Scotland, but did not support the Glorious Revolution of 1688 or the subsequent ascension of Queen Mary and William of Orange, fleeing to France. His sons were captured attempting an invasion of Scotland with French troops and were subsequently sent to the Tower of London, but later released. The title was then forfeited and never restored. =20th century= Sir Thomas Middleton of Rosefarm was a distinguished agriculturalist and deputy director general of the Department of Food Production during World War I. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1936. Castles Balbengo Castle Castles that have been owned by the Clan Middleton have included: *Fettercairn House, previously known as Middleton, half a mile north-east of the village of Fettercairn. Originally there was a castle but it was replaced in 1666 by Fettercairn House which has been extended over the centuries and has a Jacobean front. This was the seat of the Middletons from the 12th century. After the family were forfeited for supporting the Jacobite rising of 1715 it passed to the Belshes, then to the Forbeses of Pitsligo and then to Lord Clinton. *Balbengo Castle, just to the south of Fettercairn was an L-plan tower house dating from the 16th century, but replaced by a mansion two centuries later. It was long held by the Clan Wood, but was sold to the Middletons in 1687. It later passed to the Clan Ogilvy and then to the Clan Ramsay. *Pitgarvie, about three miles south and west of Laurencekirk was held by the Middletons at the end of the 17th century. There was a castle or old house, but the site is now probably occupied by a farm.

During the 18th century, two wings were added and the castle was transformed into a baroque stately home with a large garden around it. Count Frederick II von Hahn was one of the richest men of Mecklenburg in his time and dedicated himself to the science and in particular astronomy. In the southern edge of the park, he erected around 1792 Mecklenburg's first observatory which was also at one point the third largest observatory outside of Great Britain. At the start of the 19th century, his son count Carl Friedrich von Hahn (also known as the 'theatre count'), became heavily indebted due to his love for the theatre and the stage. As a result, he had to sell his Remplin estate in 1816. The new owner was George William, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe, who sold the house and estate to Karl von Maltzahn in 1848. Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the younger son of Grand Duke George, acquired the estate in 1852 on the occasion of his marriage to the Russian Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna. They resided in Russia but used Remplin Palace as their residence on their visits to Mecklenburg. Starting from 1860, the 35 hectares baroque style park was transformed into an English landscape park with the help of the landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenn√©. Also, the architect Friedrich Hitzig, a pupil of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, transformed the house into a neo-renaissance style palace. After the completion, the central Corps de Logis was decorated with a magnificent, arcaded loggia. Works of art and furniture were mostly acquired from Italy and France for the decoration of the interior. One entered the palace through a large marble domed hall, from where the visitor could go into the gallery with furniture by Andr√© Charles Boulle. To the right, the gallery connected into the oak room, the souvenir room (, and the red dining room. To the left, the gallery connected to paintings room, the music room with two Bl√ºthner grand pianos, where Robert Schumann and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky gave their performances, the tea room, and the yellow dining room. The library contained around 12,000 volumes, of which parts could be traced back to the collection of count Friedrich Hahn. The palace also contained chapels for the three different confessions of the Grand Ducal family: Russian, Roman Catholic and Evangelic. The southern wing of the palace contained the private apartments of the family as well as the stables. While the northern wing contained the rooms for the servants, the laundrette and the garage. With the death of his mother, Duke Charles Michael inherited the palace in 1894. He and his family used the palace on an occasional basis when the family was on visit from Russia. The primary residences were their Saint Petersburg palace and the Oranienbaum summer palace on the Gulf of Finland. In Remplin, the duke received many guests like the German emperor Wilhelm II in December 1891. Only when the Grand Ducal family was forced to leave Russia after the Revolution and lost all their (Russian) properties, they took up permanent residence in Remplin. After the death of his uncle, Duke George inherited the palace and estate in 1934. He suffered persecution from the Nazis due to his dynastical links to Russia and his political Catholicism. Under threat of expropriation, he was forced to sell most of his land and forests. At the start of World War II, all that remained was the palace itself and 30 hectares of land around it. The palace was destroyed by a fire in only two hours in the evening of 10 April 1940. Newspaper reports from the time suggest that a chimney fire was responsible for the accident. However, an arson attack instigated by local members of the Nazi party is probably the true cause, but could never be proven. The fire reduced the main building to the ground as the Nazis prevented fire fighters to their work, the Malchin fire brigade had apparently no fuel available to come to help. Only the northern wing was saved from destruction. Most of the art collection and the library was lost, including paintings by Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Fran√ßois Boucher, and mail correspondence between Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and queen Louise of Prussia. The Grand Ducal family was forced to leave Remplin for Berlin, where they lived until their home was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in February 1944. Duke George was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to the concentration camp in Sachsenhausen where he remained until 1945. After World War II, the family was expropriated by the Communist regime of the DDR and lost everything they had. They left for Sigmaringen in South-Western Germany. A reconstruction of the palace was never considered. In 2004, the Grand Ducal family completed the restitution process with the state which had been ongoing since 1990. The family regained ownership of land and buildings in Remplin. As the remaining north wing of the palace was so badly damaged and the extensive costs of restoration work were beyond the private funds available, the Grand Ducal family made the difficult decision to sell the Remplin palace by auction in March 2019.

Biography  Walter Ferguson was born in Guabito, Panama. on 7 May 1919, the oldest of six children. His father, Melsha Lorenzo Ferguson, was a Jamaican farmer for the United Fruit Company, and his mother, Sarah Byfield Dykin, a Costa Rican seamstress and baker of Jamaican descent. When Walter was two, his parents moved from Panama to the small fishing village of Cahuita in the Costa Rican province of Lim√≥n, where he ended up spending the rest of his life, almost never leaving it. A precocious musical talent, Ferguson showed an interest in singing and music from a young age: > ‚ÄúI had a clear vocation for music from a very tender age. No one ever taught > me anything. My mum told me that when I wasn‚Äôt even six, every time I heard > someone else singing, I would sing too. [‚Ä¶] Maybe I couldn't get all the > lyrics right, but the intonation was good. She used to tell me that I would > become a great musician, and that I would have never needed to work the > land.\\"Kh√ºn de Anta (2006), p 16: ‚ÄúMi inclinaci√≥n para la m√∫sica se despert√≥ > siendo muy ni√±o y sin que nadie me ense√±ara nada. Mi mam√° me dec√≠a que antes > de tener yo seis anos, en cuanto o√≠a yo cantar a alguien, yo cantaba. [‚Ä¶] > Quiz√°s haya heredado yo ese don de ella, Tal vez yo no cantaba perfectamente > la letra, pero la entonaci√≥n s√≠ era buena. Mi mam√° siempre me repet√≠a que de > mayor llegar√≠a a ser un ben m√∫sico y que no ten√≠a que ir nunca a trabajar a > la finca.\\" When he was seven, his mother sent him to the Caribbean port city of Lim√≥n to live with her sister Doris, who offered to help him learn to read, write and play music on her piano. His aunt's discipline and rules, however, didn't resonate well with young Walter, and he soon asked to go back to his beloved Cahuita.Kh√ºna de Anta (2006), p 19. Without any formal musical education, he taught himself to play the dulzaina, the harmonica, the ukulele, the guitar and the clarinet, his favourite instrument. Inspired by older calypsonians such as Mighty Sparrow and Papa Houdini, he started writing his own songs and attending all the calypso challenges around the Caribbean coast. Although he was mostly seen performing solo, accompanying himself on his old Martin guitar, Mr Gavitt also performed as part of groups. He formed his first calypso band in his thirties, with which he performed at local festivals and events, sometimes for a few colones, some others just for the joy of \\"bringing some happiness\\", as he recounts in an interview, especially at the weddings of less affluent couples.Kh√ºn de Anta (2006), p 20: \\"Adem√°s, aunque no tuvieramos dinero nosotros, tambi√©n acud√≠amos gratuitamente cuando sab√≠amos qua la gente no ten√≠a plata para pagarnos, sobre todo trat√°ndose de bodas, quer√≠amos dar 'un tiempo de alegr√≠a'. Nunca dependiamos de la m√∫sica para mantenernos econ√≥micamente.\\" In his forties, he formed a second band, \\"Los Miserables\\" which became quite known locally for its varied Caribbean repertoire that included genres like guaracha, rumba and bolero. The group split upon a trivial fight among two of its members that led Ferguson quit the band in sign of protest against their behaviour and promise to never play the clarinet again, a vow he kept for the rest of his life.Kh√ºna de Anta (2006), pp 22‚Äì23. Despite playing a huge part in his life, music has never been the main source of income for Mr Gavitt. Contrary to his mother's predictions,Kh√ºna de Anta (2006), p 17. he worked as a farmer throughout his life to support himself and the large family he had with his wife Julia Drummond, a childhood friend and neighbour, who died in 2016 at the age of 87. Together they had ten children and eight grandchildren.  Career  Ferguson's musical career spans over seven decades, and his work is considered to be an outstanding example of Afro-Caribbean culture. After composing his first calypso \\"A sailing boat\\" in his twenties during WWII, he went on to write an estimated two hundred throughout his life, including \\"Cabin in the Wata\\", \\"Callaloo\\" and \\"Carnaval Day\\". His life as a farmer, his devotion to God, the daily life, problems and joys of the little towns along Costa Rica's Southeastern shoreline are all central themes in his compositions, written with his signature combination of humour and tragedy in the local creole English: > \\"My mother tongue is English but Spanish is the official language of Costa > Rica and it's taught in all public schools. This is why everyone in Cahuita > is perfectly bilingual, but we use English as our every day language. [‚Ä¶] I > sang in Spanish a few times, but they were either Boleros and Guarachas, or > if they were calypsos, they were literal translations of the original > English version. I never composed in Spanish.\\"Kh√ºn de Anta (2006), p 16: \\"Mi > idioma nativo es el ingl√©s, pero al ser Costa Rica un pa√≠s oficialmente > hispanoparlante, las escuelas p√∫blicas ense√±aron siempre en espa√±ol, as√≠ que > todos los cauhuitenos somos perfectamente biling√ºes pero mantenemos todav√≠a > hoy el ingl√©s un nuestra vida diaria. Por esa raz√≥n es por lo que siempre > compongo y canto in ingl√©s, y por lo que en mi casa seguimos hablando ingl√©s > entre nosotros. Alguna vez he cantado en espa√±ol pero eran boleros y > guarachas y cuando han sido calypsos han sido traducciones literales de la > versi√≥n original en ingl√©s. Nunca he compuesto en espa√±ol.\\" The simplicity and power of Ferguson's interpretations were such that they gained him the admiration of the folk musicians of the Central Valley and prompted a new wave of calypso among the urban musicians of Lim√≥n. His influence on other Costa Rican musicians, such as Manuel Monestel of the Cantoam√©rica band, and Danny Williams of the band Kawe Calypso, both of whom recorded covers of his songs, has helped keep calypso alive in the country. Ferguson has always referred to Williams in particular as his successor. =Cassette recordings= Walter Ferguson self-recorded his music on individual tape cassettes over the years. In the late 70s, after receiving a cassette recorder from one of his sons, he started recording himself on tapes that he would then sell to travellers and music lovers from all around the globe for some extra cash. The technical limitations encouraged him to come up with ingenious solutions, such as the lo-fi overdubs he described in an interview: \\"I have two cassettes, I sing on one and when I'm done I copy it back and put another one in the recorded, so when I sing behind that, you hear two voices.\\" He kept producing his home-recorded tapes from the late 1970s to the end of the 1990s, when he decided to retire from his music career and only perform occasionally. Ferguson never wrote down the lyrics nor the music of his songs nor he ever made any copies of his cassettes, so each tape was a unique, original recording session. In an attempt to recover this lost treasure, in January 2018 his son Peck Ferguson and Niels Werdenberg launched ‚ÄúThe Walter Ferguson Tape Hunt‚Äù, a worldwide project aimed at rescuing all of Mr Gavitt's forgotten songs, in preparation for his 100th birthday celebrations in May 2019.Peck Ferguson, http://walterferguson- tapehunt.mozello.com/the-project/: \\"Some years ago our family started to look around for original cassettes that contain my father's older calypsos. But the only cassette we could find was in pretty bad shape. Soon it became clear that we needed to look further than just within the circle of friends. I remember hearing so many great songs from my father when I was younger. They are not on his official CDs and LPs, and now he can't recall them anymore... many of them must be on these tapes.\\" =Vinyl records= Already a local legend, in 1982 Ferguson had the opportunity to record his first vinyl ‚ÄúMr Gavitt: Costa Rican calypso‚Äù, a collection of some of his most famous songs produced by the American musicologist Michael Williams under the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings label. The album also included an English translation of the lyrics and a short biography. However, due to its poor sound quality, the album never found distribution in Costa Rica. In 1986, the label Indica produced his second vinyl called \\"Calypsos del Caribe de Costa Rica\\" (Calypsos from the Caribbean Costa Rica) which included different songs, as well as some lyrics in English and a short biography of Ferguson written by the local historian Paula Palmer. =Compact discs= It wasn't until 2002, with the help of the label Papaya Music, that Ferguson could record his first high-quality CD. The first issue that the producers of Papaya had to face was that Mr Gavitt, then 83, refused to travel to the capital city of San Jos√© to record, so they had to take the recording studio to Cahuita instead, and specifically to his family-owned hotel \\"Sol y Mar\\", at the entrance of the Cahuita National Park. They used mattresses and rugs to soundproof one of the rooms, muffle the sounds of the local pet parrots, dogs, passing buses and trucks, and increase the temperature so that they could separate the tracks of his voice and his guitar. At last, \\"Babylon\\" was released in 2003, and Ferguson's work was finally recognised and appreciated at a larger scale. The CD consists of thirteen original tunes with only Ferguson accompanying himself on his guitar. It became a national and international success not only for its witty lyrics, but also for the unique recording process it went through. Though Ferguson had already achieved legendary status on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica before \\"Babylon\\" and his second CD \\"Dr Bombodee\\" (2004), their publication rescued him from oblivion and gave him back his status of calypsonian. In 2013, the annual Festival International de Calypso Walter Ferguson was established in his honour in Cahuita. In 2017, he was awarded the Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial \\"Emilia Prieto Tugores\\" prize.

The club's chairman was Philipp Leichner at the beginning of the season and during the season Franz Rinderer took over as chairman. FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel. Retrospectively considered, the most important event in this FCB season, was the fact that the first youth department was founded.  Overview  Basel played a total of 28 matche in the 1915‚Äì16 season. 14 of these were in the domestic league and 14 were friendly matches. Of these friendlies six were won, three were drawn and five ended in a defeat. There were six one home fixtures played in the Landhof and eight away games. Four of these games were played in the Basel championship against the two other local teams Old Boys and Nordstern Basel. FC Basel won the Basel championship collecting three victories and a draw. In all of these friendly games Basel scored 31 goals and conceded 30. The Swiss Serie A 1915‚Äì16 was divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West. Basel and the two other teams were allocated to the Central group. Further teams playing in the Central group were two from Bern, Young Boys and FC Bern, two from La Chaux-de-Fonds, FC La Chaux-de-Fonds, √âtoile-Sporting FC La Chaux-de-Fonds and finally Biel- Bienne. Basel didn't start well into the championship, winning only one of the first eight games. They ended the season in second-last position with nine points. In their 14 games Basel scored 30 goals and conceded 39. Local rivals BSC Old Boys won the group and continued to the finals. Here they played against Cantonal Neuchatel and Winterthur.

He played college football at Maryland. High school career Johnson grew up in Cumberland, Maryland, and is a member of the graduating class of 2015 at Fort Hill High School. Johnson was a multi-year starter at both running back and defensive back for the high school football team. In his junior and senior seasons at Fort Hill in 2013 and 2014, Johnson lead the Sentinels to back to back Maryland 1A State Football Championships. After both seasons, Johnson was named Area High School Football Player of the Year by the Cumberland Times- News, and in 2014 was named to the Maryland High School Consensus All-State team by the Maryland High School Football Foundation. Johnson was responsible for nearly 5,000 all-purpose yards and 65 touchdowns during his two full varsity seasons. College career Johnson was rated as a three-star college prospect, the 20th best recruit in the state of Maryland, and the 64th best running back prospect in the country by Rivals. Johnson verbally committed to the Maryland Terrapins briefly after being offered a scholarship in June 2014 by then-head coach Randy Edsall at a football camp at Maryland Stadium. Johnson officially signed his letter of intent to attend Maryland in February 2015. While Johnson was recruited by other programs, he did not receive a scholarship offer from a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) program other than the Terrapins. In four seasons with the Terrapins, Johnson tallied 4,196 all- purpose yards, third in program history. In his sophomore season in 2016, Johnson set the Terrapins‚Äô single season yards per carry record, averaging 9.1 yards per rushing attempt. Johnson also starred as a kick returner, finishing his collegiate career with 1,194 kick return yards and two return touchdowns, one going for 100 yards against Ohio State in 2017, and another going for 98 yards against Michigan in 2018. Johnson graduated from Maryland in December 2018. Professional career Johnson did not receive an invitation to the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine. However, at Maryland's football pro day, scouts from 29 NFL teams, plus scouts from two Arena Football League teams and one Canadian Football League team were present to observe the workouts of 15 Maryland players, including Johnson. Johnson impressed scouts by running a 40-yard dash time clocked by most scouts as anywhere between 4.3 and 4.4 seconds, with one scout reportedly timing Johnson as fast as 4.26 seconds. For comparison, the fastest 40-yard dash time ran by any running back at the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine was 4.40 seconds by Justice Hill of the Oklahoma State Cowboys. At his pro day workout, Johnson was also able to do 27 repetitions of the bench press at 225 pounds, which would have ranked the highest among 2019 Combine running backs, and was recorded jumping a 34-inch vertical. =Detroit Lions= Johnson was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the sixth-round (186th overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft. Johnson made his NFL debut in the Lions' regular season opener against the Arizona Cardinals and had a six-yard carry in the 27‚Äì27 tie. Johnson made his first career start in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears and had five carries for 16 rushing yards. Overall, in his rookie season, Johnson had 63 carries for 273 rushing yards and 24 receptions for 109 receiving yards. On October 1, 2020, Johnson was waived by the Lions. =New York Jets= On October 2, 2020, Johnson was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets.

The book claims that the wealthy Rockefeller family is planning to take control of the world's agriculture and food supply through the Green Revolution and the promotion of genetically modified organisms which would lead to the elimination of independent farms.  Content  In this book Engdahl presents a conspiracy theory centred around the idea that current descents of the Rockefeller family have developed a plan to take control of the global agricultural system. In addition, Engdahl makes a claim that the Rockefellers run a genetically modified organism (GMO) project to control world population. According to the book, this plan is to eliminate independent farms in the United States as well as out right destroy the agricultural system of other countries in order to reduce food security. Among other theories, the book also claims that the Green Revolution is really a secret plot to destroy seed diversity and promote oil and gas-based agricultural products as well as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Engdahl claims that this plot is supported by many world leaders, as well as international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

It is only known from such isolated teeth, which are large and can measure up to an excess of , equating to a size rivaling the great white shark, but are rare and found in deposits in the East Coast of the United States and Malta. Teeth of A. palatasi are strikingly similar to those of the giant thresher Alopias grandis, and the former has been considered as a variant of the latter in the past. Scientists hypothesized that A. palatasi may have had attained lengths comparable with the great white shark and a body outline similar to it. Discovery and taxonomy A. palatasi was initially thought to be a morphotype of the giant thresher A. grandis (above). In 2002, rumors began about discoveries of a new type of large serrated shark teeth pertaining to an undescribed species of mackerel shark from Miocene deposits in South Carolina by amateur collectors and fossil dealers. While these fossils were often dismissed as teeth from other sharks such as the megalodon and the false-toothed mako (Parotodus benedenii), a consensus was reached that they were likely from a morphotype of the giant thresher Alopias grandis. Despite the large attention given by amateur collectors and fossil dealers, such fossils remained unmentioned in the scientific literature for many years. In 2014, a fossil dealer named Mark Palatas donated a single tooth to paleoichthyologist David Ward in hopes that it would spark a formal description. Ward subsequently initiated its research with his colleague Bretton Kent. The following year in October 2015, Ward and Kent presented a poster to the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology reporting the existence of the new species. In 2018, the two published a formal paper giving it the scientific name Alopias palatasi in honor of Palatas, and as a sister species of A. grandis. The two designed seven type specimens from the collections of the Calvert Marine Museum (CMM) and the National Museum of Natural History (USNM). The holotype is CMM-V-385, a right upper anterior tooth found in Bed 12 of the Calvert Formation cliffs near Parkers Creek. Six paratypes were also designated: CMM-V-3876, a heavily worn tooth found at the beaches at the Flag Ponds Nature Park that was reworked from either the Choptank Formation or the Plum Point Member of the Calvert Formation; CMM-V-3981, a right upper lateral tooth collected from the beaches near Parkers Creek; CMM-V-4242, a tooth from the beaches of Calvert County, Maryland; CMM-V-5823, a left lower lateral tooth and the tooth that Palatas donated, which he found in the downstream of the May River, South Carolina; USNM 411148, a tooth also found in Bed 12 of the Calvert Formation cliffs near Parkers Creek; and USNM 639783, a tooth also collected from the beaches near Parkers Creek. Description Although a thresher shark, scientists hypothesized that A. palatasi may have looked similar to the great white shark. A. palatasi is only known from isolated teeth. They are large, measuring up to an excess of in height and suggesting a shark that grew to similar sizes or was larger than the modern great white shark, which grows between on average and up to in maximum length. The crown is arched and broad with cutting edges possessing coarse serrations that are largely irregular in size but become finer towards the tip. The root consists of deep root lobes and a strongly arched base. The A. palatasi dental structure is heterodontic, meaning that the shape of teeth differs between each tooth in a jaw. A. palatasi teeth are most similar in size and form to the teeth of its sister species A. grandis, the only main difference being the presence of serrations in the former. The size, broadness, and serrations of A. palatasi teeth are also convergently similar to the modern great white shark. The dental similarities between the two led Ward and Kent to hypothesize that A. palatasi may not have possessed the elongated tail seen in modern thresher sharks and instead may have had a body outline similar to the great white shark. Paleoecology The majority of A. palatasi fossils are known from Burdigalian to Serravallian deposits of the Calvert Formation in Maryland and Virginia, the Pungo River Formation in North Carolina, and the Coosawhatchie Formation in South Carolina. A. palatasi is also occasionally known from the Upper Globigerina Limestone in Malta, which suggests that its distribution was not restricted to the western Atlantic, but extended into the Mediterranean. However, A. palatasi fossils have not been found elsewhere in the Old World, though teeth of A. grandis have been found in Belgium. The United States East Coast localities have yielded a diverse and rich assemblage of marine vertebrates. The Calvert Formation holds twelve genera of cetaceans such as the proto-dolphins Squalodon, Kentriodon, and Eurhinodelphis, the physeteroid Orycterocetus, the mysticetes Mesocetus and Eobalaenoptera, and unspecified beaked whales. Other marine mammals include pinnipeds such as the earless seal Leptophoca. Of the sharks, fourteen genera are known from the Calvert Formation. These include various species of makos, Carcharhinus sharks, tiger sharks, thresher sharks, the giant snaggletooth Hemipristis serra, the early great white Cosmopolitodus hastalis, Parotodus benedenii, Notorynchus, and the otodontids megalodon and its direct ancestor Carcharocles chubutensis. The Pungo River and Coosawhatchie Formations hold similar assemblages of marine vertebrates. It is notable that A. palatasi fossils have been typically found comingled with C. chubutensis.

She studied Mathematics at University College London (UCL) and on graduating joined the UK Meteorological (Met) Office in 1951, attending their Initial Forecasting Course that year. She went on to work with Bushby in using the Lyons Electronic Office (LEO), an early computer developed by J. Lyons & Co of Cadby Hall, London, becoming an expert in writing, running and correcting computer programs for weather forecasting. She was seen at that time as one of the first prominent female meteorologists and also the first to play a leading role in the development of Numerical Weather Prediction, not only in the UK but also worldwide.  Early life and education  Hinds passed her Higher School Certificate in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and physics. This was an ideal combination of subjects for the study of meteorology in which she was already developing an interest. On the strength of her examination results, Mavis was awarded a scholarship and a place to read Mathematics at University College London (UCL).  Research and career  From 1951 Hinds worked at the UK Met Office as part of their Forecast Research Division, which had been set up in 1949 in Dunstable, England. Hinds, as part of the Division, was instrumental in the development of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The earliest days of NWP in the late 1940s relied on hand calculation but as electronic computing machines began to be developed in the US (ENIAC) and the UK (EDSAC and LEO I), NWP grew in reliability and prevalence. In 1954 at a meeting of the Royal Meteorological Society, Bushby and Hinds presented the first computer-based baroclinic forecast in Europe. Since 1951, they had been making use of the computing power of the first Lyons Electronic Office (LEO), the world's first business computer, developed by J. Lyons & Co caterers of Cadby Hall, London. Because in the early 1950s the UK Met Office had no in-house computing facilities, calculating power had to be obtained from part-time use of LEO I and also the Ferranti Mark 1 Star at the University of Manchester. Use of these very early computers involved working unsociable hours when the machines were not being used by others. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Hinds worked with Fred Bushby and others on a series of published papers that detailed the developments made. In 1981, Hind reflected on the impact of computing on weather prediction that started for her with work done using the LEO I and in 1994 contributed a chapter about the history of UK Met Office computerisation to Peter Bird's book on the development of the LEO computers  References   External links  * https://www.leo- computers.org.uk/reports.html 1929 births 2009 deaths British meteorologists Alumni of University College London Women meteorologists ","title":"Mavis Hinds"},{"id":"60602180","text":"Armon Watts (born July 22, 1996) is an American football defensive tackle for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL).

He was one of the first investors in Yandex, Ozon, Delivery Hero, Epam, DataDog as well as SnapDeal. In 2012 he was the Internet investor of the year (Forbes). Most successful investor of the year (RBC, 2017). He is in Forbes billionaires list.  Early life  Boguslavsky studied physics-mathematics at school in Moscow, USSR. In middle school he won the Moscow University Biology Olympiad and went on a year later to win the USSR TV Mathematics Olympiad. Boguslavsky graduated from the Moscow Institute of Transport Engineering (MIIT) in 1973, majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. From 1973‚Äî1990, he conducted scientific research at the Institute of Control Sciences of the USSR Academy of Sciences in mathematics for computer systems and networks. Upon receiving his Doctorate of Science (Engineering) Boguslavsky wrote more than 100 articles, 3 scientific books and made several inventions while spearheading his own laboratory. He was the first scientist from USSR who published his results on new algorithms for virtual memory management in IEEE Transactions on Computers in the United States Scientific Journal that covers aspects of Computer Science. In 1985, together with a team of developers from the Academy of Science of Moldova, Boguslavsky launched a project to create a software system to connect IBM mainframes with Digital minicomputers and personal computers into an integrated computer network. As a result, he was awarded two significant contracts to implement these networks in 1987, one in a Czech coil mining company and another at the Polytechnic University in Slovakia.  Career  = Beginnings 1989 to 1990 = In 1989 started his work on the LogoVAZ. Boguslavsky became a deputy director and a shareholder, first organizing the computer business of LogoVAZ and then completing several other business projects. In 1990, Boguslavsky was offered by Oracle Corporation to distribute Oracle software products in the USSR and he concluded the exclusive distribution agreement with Oracle for the territory of the USSR. From 1991 to 1992, he served as a visiting professor at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Toronto, Canada. In 1992, Boguslavsky used his shareholding stake in LogoVAZ to redeem the computer business from the Company and its shareholders in order to concentrate on his own business ‚Äì the company LVS. LVS became the first or one of the first Russian business partners of many well-known software, computer, and network vendors. In 1993, LVS developed the Oracle-based information system for the apartment privatization of Moscow. The system was awarded the Computer World Smithsonian Award in the United States and was featured in the Oracle Annual Report. In 1994, LVS was awarded a contract to provide the whole IT infrastructure for the State Duma of Russia and successfully carried out the project. In 1995, LVS became the prime contractor to develop the Uzbekistan national automated passport control system. In late 1996 Boguslavsky sold LVS to Price Waterhouse (currently known as PwC) and then became a Managing Partner at PwC, in charge of its Management Consulting Services (MCS) practice in Russia in early 1997. As Partner, Boguslavsky was the lead negotiator and client partner dealing with Gazprom over the largest system integration and SAP implementation contracts at the time. In December 1999, Boguslavsky met investment bankers Charles Ryan (UFG), Michael Calvey (Baring Vostok) and David Mixer (Rex Capital), who were planning to set up an Internet investment company at that time. = Investor, 2000 until today = ru-Net Holdings Limited, an investment company with startup capital of $20 million, was jointly founded by Boguslavsky, Ryan, Calvey and Mixer in 2000. Boguslavsky invested a substantial amount of the total holdings and became Chairman of the board of directors. In the same year, ru-Net Holdings Limited invested in Yandex, paying $5.27 million for a 35% stake, and in the online retailer Ozon.ru, buying a controlling stake for $3 million. Both projects were part of big IT companies ‚Äì Comptek and Reksoft as non-core businesses; thus, they became two independent companies due to the investments. After Boguslavsky decided to leave PwC and focus on investing in Internet companies. However, he still had his position in PwC for one more year to look for a successor and arrange the formalities of the handover. Boguslavsky left PwC in 2001 and became CEO and Chairman of the board of directors of ru-Net Holdings. During 2000 and 2001, ru-Net Holdings survived the dot-com crisis, although some investors intended to exit the business and distribute the remaining funds. Some investors were especially concerned about the future of Yandex, whose revenues were low at the time. ru-Net Holdings made its first investments in a couple of system integration and software development companies in 2002, buying stakes in TopS (Russia-based enterprise management systems integrator) and VDI (offshore programming). Later, VDI merged with Epam to become the largest offshore programming and software outsourcing company in Central and Eastern Europe and launched an IPO on NASDAQ. ru-Net Holdings restructured its business in 2006 with only Yandex shares left and the company changed its name to Internet Search Investment Limited (ISIL). Other assets (including shares of Ozon.ru, TopS, and VDI) were distributed among the shareholders of ru-Net Holdings. As a result, Boguslavsky was still a significant shareholder of ISIL and, accordingly, a beneficiary of shareholding in Yandex (he had also invested additional funds) on one hand and obtained corresponding stakes in all other assets on the other hand. In 2006 he set up his own investment company ru-Net Limited that took control of his assets and made new investments in IT and Internet technologies and services. VDI merged with Epam, and TopS joined Systematica and the AND Project companies transforming into Systematica Group. Boguslavsky became Chairman of its board of directors. Later a large stake in the Group was bought by A1, the investment subdivision of Alfa Group. Later Systematica Group acquired a large distributor, Landata. ru-Net Limited also owned Energodata, a big IT outsourcing company supporting SAP systems in Russia's federal electric grid sector. Additionally, ru-Net established PSI Energo, a joint venture with the German software company PSI AG, to introduce dispatching information systems into electric grids. In 2007 Boguslavsky invested in HeadHunter and iContext. Boguslavsky left the board of directors in Yandex in 2008 as he started investing in companies that could potentially create a conflict of interest with Yandex. He purchases the Digital Access Company from Leonard Blavatnik and his partners, international music majors and together with Oleg Tumanov set up Russia's online video service ivi.ru. In 2010 Boguslavsky invested in Biglion. Yandex floated 17.6% of its shares on NASDAQ for $1.3 billion on the 24th of May 2011. Boguslavsky sold a small portion of his shares during the IPO. He partly used the funds (about $60 million) to invest in the purchase of new shares in Ozon, leading to the largest investment ($100 million) in an Internet company in Russian history. In 2011 and 2012, ru-Net sold its shareholdings in the system integration and IT service companies EPAM, Systematica, Energodata, and PSI Energo. ru-Net continues to invest in Russian internet companies. It purchased a stake in 2GIS and increases its investments in existing portfolio companies. In 2011 he set up a US-based subsidiary, the venture capital company - ru-Net Technology Partners (RTP Ventures). Headed by Kirill Sheynkman, RTP actively invests in early-stage companies in the US market with investments in Big Data, SaaS, cloud computing, Fintech, Health Care, IoT and Information Security. ru-Net started investing in Europe and India. Among some of the early investments was German startup Delivery Hero that later in 2017 was valuated at ‚Ç¨4.5 billion at IPO. In India, Boguslavsky invested in Practo, Faasos, Snapdeal and other companies. In the United States his investments include RingCentral, which had a successful IPO in 2013. RTP was among the first investors in Datadog. In 2016, Boguslavsky invested in the coaching company Iloverunning Family (that now is known as I Love SuperSport holding company), and in European internet company Urban Sport Club, that sells passes to sport and fitness clubs. He also co-founded the first professional international league in triathlon - Super League Triathlon (SLT). His partners are the triathlon legend Chris McCormack and Michael D‚ÄôHulst.  Personal life  Boguslavsky is married and has four children. His hobbies include kitesurfing, skiing, triathlon, bicycle racing and extreme travelling. In 2013, he started his first triathlon training and took part in several Ironman races. He managed to get his first podium spot after only six months of training. A year and a half later, being a prizewinner of several races in his age category, he qualified for the 2015 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. He is the founder of Super League Triathlon, having established it in 2017. In 2013, Boguslavsky together with his mother, Zoya Boguslavskaya, established the Andrei Voznesensky Fund in memory of Zoya's late husband, Russian Poet, Andrei Voznesensky.

The palace was destroyed during World War II and was not constructed, although possible. Only the park remains today. History The Neustrelitz Palace was originally constructed as a hunting lodge in Glienke on the Zierker lake around 1710/ 1711. After the castle in Strelitz was burned down in the eve of 24 October 1712, the ducal family was forced to live in hunting lodges for a number of years. The architect Christoph Julius L√∂we transformed the hunting lodge into a baroque style three-story, three-winged palace. It became the principal residence of duke Adolf Friedrich in 1733. Around the palace, the city of Neustrelitz was constructed which eventually became the new capital of the duchy. Over the years the palace expanded and changed, lastly between 1905 and 1909. It remained the seats of the Duke and Grand Dukes up to 1918 when the monarchy in Germany came to an end. The palace became property of the new Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. It served as parliament and museum. The Palace was destroyed during a fire in the night of 29 April 1945. Although parts of palace could have been restored, the Communist regime of East Germany decided to demolish it for ideological reasons. Only the foundations remains remained. Reconstruction In the 1990s, there were initiatives to reconstruct sections of the palace. Finally in December 2019, the Government of Pomerania and Mayor of Neustrelitz signed an agreement to clear the surviving castle basement of sand, construct a concrete ceiling for it, and commence planning for reconstruction of the tower.Land und Stadt Neustrelitz besiegeln Schlossberg-Vertrag, Norkurier, 20 December 2019 After ten years of restoration and reconstruction, the Neustrelitz Palace Gardens were re-opened to the public in the summer of 2019.Neustrelitz: Der Schlossgarten ist fertig, NDR, 14 August 2019; References *This article was initially translated from the German Wikipedia.

Wright State University suggests that the current community definition of crip includes people who experience any form of disability, such as one or more impairments with physical, mental, learning, and sensory. People might identify as a crip for many reasons. Some of these reasons are to show pride, to talk about disability rights, or avoid ranking types of disability. The term cripple came into common usage around 950AD. While cripple appeared to describe someone with a physical disability, it eventually became a slur focused on people deemed ugly due to a physical disability. The use of crip, as a slur, was not limited to people. Emily Hutcheon and Gregor Wolbring stated that crip could be used for 'an action/event/object/person' that did not meet its intended purpose. By the 1920s crip was being used as slang for 'easy'. With the rise of the disability rights movement in the 1960s came the idea of disability pride; a movement to shed the feelings of shame that society had forced on people with disabilities. Part of the process of disability pride was reclaiming words used to shame the disability community. Thus, crip's new meaning developed as an 'insider' term within the disability rights movement. Crip theory began in communities but is not an academic theory that intersects with experiences, like race, class or gender. Other crip theories are crip time, which has roots in both the disability community and academic theory (through crip futurity).  History  Crip is a slang term for the words cripple. The origins of cripple come from two Old English words, crypel and crƒìopel. These terms have Germanic roots in krupilaz which meant to 'creep'. Crypel and crƒìopel could be used to describe people or places. When directed towards people crypel denoted a disability, being of small stature, or could be a surname. In relation to a place, crypel could be used to denote a small opening. In the context of a place cryple was used along with other words to create the name. The earliest written usage of cripple is dated at 950 ADE in the Lindisfarne Gospels. In this context, cripple was used to describe people who have difficulty walking, such as people with physical disabilities. While the term cripple was in common usage, it could often be found in the literature to describe characters who had issues with walking, or difficulty using their limbs. In 1893, novelist Owen Wister referred to a character who was shot in the leg as \\"Crip Jones\\". By the 1920s crip took on new meaning, though still appears to be connected to disability. During this time crip began being used as a slang term for \\"easy\\", which may have reflected society's low expectations of disabled people (an easy pitch in baseball was a \\"baseball crip\\", and an easy course in school was a \\"crip course\\"). Because of these new usages of the term cripple and crip, moving from descriptive to derogatory, cripple and crip are defined as a dated and offensive terms. These terms have been used pejoratively as a negative term and an insult. = Disability rights movement = During the 1960s, the disability rights movements began to gain momentum. A component of this movement was creating a sense of disability pride, which aimed to stop feeling shame as a result of the disabilities. It is here when the term crip began being reclaimed. The reclaiming process was bolstered by the introduction of the social model of disability in the 1970s, which was adopted by the UN in the 1980s. Crip has continued in common usage within the disability community. Thought the term has broadened to include people with any form of disability, not just those with physical impairments. Some social movements that employ the term crip are #CripTheVote, Crip Camp, and Crip Raves. The reclaiming of the term crip has had wider impacts as seen through the artistic movement like Krip Hop Nation, cripitiques and Crip Collectives (disability writers collectives),and documentary films like Fixed and Crip Camp. Crip is sometimes used as a proper noun, \\"Crip,\\" and sometimes even as a verb, in which \\"cripping\\" something means applying a disability justice lens to it. In this and many ways, the reclaiming of \\"crip\\" mirrors the reclaiming of queer. People with disabilities deem crip an insider term as they are the group changing the meaning and usage of the word. It is looked down upon when outsiders use the word crip, as it can lead to confusion on if crip is being reclaimed or used as a slur.  Purpose  Those who identify as crips use the term for various reasons: * To express pride in being a member of the disability community (\\"crip pride\\") * To express resilience in crips' struggle for rights and equity and their resistance against ableism and oppression * To have a unified term for all kinds of disabilities, thus avoiding disability hierarchy (the attitude that people with some types of disabilities are more or less important than people with others) * To disempower the term's historical pejorative usages * To identify other crips who themselves identify as crips  Crip theory  Due to the influence of the disability rights movement, there were new ways of understanding disability. For instance, the social model was introduced by disability rights organisations in the 1970s. With the work of activist scholars like Mike Oliver understandings from the community, like that of the social model of disability, entered academia. These new ways of understanding disability created a new academic area of study, called disability studies. Within disability studies, crip theory formed. Crip theory was a way to explore the experience of disability, acknowledge the history of exclusion of the disability community and other social barriers related to disability. Crip theory developed within this field as an intersection with gender and sexuality and fell within what is known as critical disability studies.Hall, Melinda C. (2019), \\"Critical Disability Theory\\", in Zalta, Edward N. (ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2019 ed.), Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University, retrieved 2020-07-15 While crip was developed by communities to understand their oppression from a disability perspective crip might change when it enters academic spaces. For example, crip time is a concept that began in communities. This idea suggests that our society has ideas about how long and how much energy and resources a task will take. When these ideas were made they were based on an able-bodied person. Being able-bodied means that you have minimal impairments physically, mentally, or sensory or not identifying as having a disability. Due to the assumption of able-bodediness there is a lack of consideration of the time, energy, or resources needed for people with disabilities. It is common for a disabled person doing a task to need more time, or they might use energy and resources differently, or they might need assistance from another person. To accommodate these needs people with disabilities have to be careful when considering what they can do in relation to life and work expectation with the resources they have. When some people with disabilities extend themselves, they pay with exhaustion, pain, or difficulties focusing. Some disabled people use spoon theory to talk about the way they have to manage resources.Miserandino, Christine (2003). \\"The Spoon Theory\\". But You Don't Look Sick. Archived from the original on 17 November 2019. Retrieved 15 July 2020\\"Explaining Low Stamina Levels ‚Äì with Spoons\\". BBC Online. 21 June 2013. Retrieved 15 July 2020. Academic views of crip time connected to ideas of futurity, which is based on temporal theory. This theory, developed by Alison Kafer in Feminist, Queer, Crip, builds on the work queer temporal theory. Crip time theory asks us to think about the connections between time, marginalisation, and visibility. Or how we imagine in our histories and futures. It is argued that people with disabilities (and other marginalised identities) are made invisible from our past and futures. When we remove people with disabilities from our histories and imagined futures, we must also wonder why would policies, laws, and communities would take the needs of disabled people into account.  Controversy  The reclaiming of \\"crip\\" is not universally accepted by disabled people. There are several critiques about trying to reclaim crip. Some think that reclaiming the term crip continues to put people with disabilities in relation to able-bodiless, which is argued can maintain harmful views of disabled people. Others object to using crip because this term, and cripple, can still be used as a slur. There have been concerns broached that crip is close to Crips, which is a street gang in the United States. Some claim that the reclaiming of the word crip is done by privileged people, often white and within academia. They critique the right of privileged people engaged in the process of reclaiming when the needs and wants of disadvantaged people with disabilities are not taken into account. Those with this stance argue that, as Kirstin Marie Bone says, crip theory 'silences actual disabled experience and fractures the community, harming instead of helping'. Yet, there are also calls from people about how the reclaiming and understandings of disability that happens through crip creates space for people to explore intersectionality with race, class or other forms of oppression.

Colchuck Balanced Rock is part of The Enchantments within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. It belongs to the Stuart Range which is subset of the Cascade Range. Colchuck Balanced Rock is situated west of Enchantment Peak, and east of Jabberwocky Tower and Colchuck Lake. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into the lake and Mountaineer Creek, a tributary of Icicle Creek. The climbing approach is via the Colchuck Lake Trail, then traversing away from Aasgard Pass approximately 400 feet above the lake. The mountain is named for its pyramidal summit which has a top-block that nests, rather than balances, on the summit.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Colchuck Balanced Rock The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

His research sought to provide an evidence-based reform of financial reporting and accounting practice and he is regarded one of the 20th century‚Äôs greatest accounting thinkers. Chambers has been described by his peers as an ‚Äúaccounting pioneer,\\" an ‚Äúintellectual giant‚Äù of the twentieth century‚Äîtruly a Renaissance man and a \\"intellectual leader and an always stimulating presence: a rigorous theorist and prolific author whose impact was felt around the world.\\" Chambers was selected by Dick Edwards as one of his Twentieth Century Accounting Thinkers. Additionally, he was the first academic outside of North America to be inducted into the American Accounting Association‚Äôs Accounting Hall of Fame. He received many other awards, such as in 1958 being the first recipient of the Australian Society of Accountants' Citation for Meritorious Contribution to the Literature of Accounting, Accounting and Action, and in 1967 the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants‚Äô Gold Medal for outstanding contribution to accounting literature, Accounting, Evaluation and Economic Behavior. In 1978 he was awarded the Order of Australia for services to commerce and education, particularly in accounting and business management. He published nearly 300 articles, a dozen books and monographs, made over 100 submissions to the press and various public and professional accounting bodies, as well as delivering close to 400 lectures across the world. Accounting, Evaluation and Economic Behavior, Securities and Obscurities, and An Accounting Thesaurus are his most well-known book-length contributions.  Early life and education  Chambers‚Äô Yorkshire father, John emigrated to Australia in 1912 and married Louisa Moog. They lived in Newcastle and had two children, Raymond and Cyril Albert. Louisa died in the early 1920s and the children then lived with relatives. John remarried Esme Mabel May in the mid-1920s which allowed the children to return home. Chambers pursued secondary education at Newcastle Boys High, graduating in 1934 with what Chambers described as ‚Äòmodest grades‚Äô. In 1935 those grades enabled him to apply successfully for a Scholarship to attend the University of Sydney; he graduated in 1939 with a Bachelor of Economics degree.  Academic career  While pursuing a University degree Chambers also enrolled part-time for an accounting certificate. He entered academia in late 1943, after having worked in the private sector at several companies, and the wartime Prices Commission set up by the Australian government to regulate prices. Chambers‚Äô first academic appointment was as a Lecturer at Sydney Technical College (now part of the institution known as TAFE NSW). Chambers set up the first management education programmes in Australia and remained at the college until 1953, when he was appointed as the first full-time accounting position at the University of Sydney, a Senior Lecturer. This was followed by promotions to Associate Professor in 1955 and foundation Professor in 1960. = Contributions to Accounting Thought = Throughout the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Chambers was an \\"internationalist\\" reformer ‚Äì for over twenty years he travelled (often with his family which was unusual for an Antipodean academic at that time) first to Europe in 1959 and then to the USA (for a total of 4.5 years ‚Äì out of those 20). He held several visiting professorships at various institutions such as the Universities of Chicago, California at Berkeley, Michigan Ann- Arbor, Florida, and Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, but he remained in permanent employment at the University of Sydney. The 1977 American Accounting Association study, Statement of Accounting Theory and Theory Acceptance described Chambers as a leading \\"golden age‚Äô theoretician,\\" recognizing his influence in promoting \\"decision usefulness\\" as a major purpose of accounting. He sought to rid accounting of its infelicities, its addiction to dogma; and to formulate a theoretically-based system of accounting founded on principles drawn from the domain of commerce ‚Äì his conceptual framework. During the 1960s and 1970s through memberships of The Institute of Management Science and the Operations Research Society of America (later known as INFORMS) he mixed with US Accounting and Operations Research (OR) academics William Cooper and Ernest Weinwurm) who were then international leaders of the emerging OR discipline. Chambers advocated an accounting having economic and social impacts. Being a system of mathematical and linguistic symbols accounting had the potential to ensure trust amongst market participants and facilitate wealth distribution among society. Given this, his market price-based theory sought a solution to two enduring related accounting puzzles ‚Äì namely ‚Äòthe riddle of the money illusion‚Äô and why its solution (what he called ‚Äòthe ideal‚Äô) had not been demanded for centuries by those in business relying on accounting. While well known for his theorizing little is known about his practical experiences, especially his business consultancies that informed that theorizing. During the 1950s, 60s and seventies he provided advice in respect of many industries and myriad issues to major accounting and law firms, business associations and large public companies. Federal and State government departments also sought his advice in the form of expert opinions. = CoCoA system = Chambers proposed in the 1960s a market-based system of continuously contemporary accounting (CoCoA); an alternative to the conventional, historic cost accounting method. At a time when historic cost accounting concentrated on accounting from an ‚Äúearnings viewpoint‚Äù‚Äîespecially after adjusting for periodic cost allocations by recourse to what is described as the matching principle‚ÄîChambers adopted a ‚Äúbalance sheet‚Äù viewpoint in the calculation of income. His system articulated definitions of asset, liability, revenue, expense, distributions, contributions, and focused on specifying the ‚Äúproperty‚Äù of assets and liabilities to be measured, namely their current cash equivalent. It also prescribed that changes in the purchasing power of money should be recognized in the accounts. In this regard, Chambers anticipated what is now widely known as the conceptual framework of accounting and the real (in an economics sense) exit price form of the present system known as fair value accounting. = Thesaurus of Accounting = Interestingly, Chambers was a practicing archivist as evidenced by his roles as secretary and committee member of the N.S.W. Division of the Business Archives of Australia from 1961‚Äì1969. His archivist tendencies resulted in the development of an extensive collection of correspondence, the Chambers Archive It presaged his An Accounting Thesaurus: Five Hundred Years of Accounting, which remains the only thesaurus of accounting. It has over 6,000 entries, Dewey-classified and cross-referenced. = Impact on the Practicing Arm of the Profession = Chambers was the first academic to be appointed as National President of one of the two major Australian professional bodies, CPA Australia (1977‚Äì78), having been a National Councillor for many years. In the 1960s together with Australian professorial contemporaries Russell Matthews and Lou Goldberg he oversaw several education initiatives, the differentiation of accounting education from training and ultimately changes to the entry requirements to the accounting profession that resulted in graduate entry to the profession in Australia. Chambers‚Äô acknowledged theoretical and practical expertise led to his appointment as Chairman of the 1978 N.S.W. government-appointed Accounting Standards Review Committee whose brief was to examine and report on the Australian accounting profession‚Äôs promulgated accounting standards and to consider any other standards that might be useful for parties drawing on published accounting information. = Other administrative roles = At the University he served many administrative, teaching and research roles. He was a Fellow of Senate (1983‚Äì86 and Chairman, Finance Committee of Senate (1983‚Äì86), the first Treasurer of the University Staff Club (1961), Member of the Board (chairman 1960‚Äì63) of the University Co-Operative Bookshop, Committee member Sydney Association of University Teachers (1954‚Äì58), member of the Board of Sydney University Union (1961), University of Sydney Appointments Board (Chair 1963‚Äì70), University of Sydney Extensions Board member (1964‚Äì82). In 1960 he was appointed Foundation Professor of Accounting. In that capacity he developed curricula for the undergraduate, honours and postgraduate degree programs in accounting. = Retirement = Chambers officially retired in 1982, but was reappointed immediately for 1 year. For the next decade or more he was very productive in retirement. A collection of his articles was published as Chambers on Accounting; he codified his ideas on a conceptual Framework of Accounting which was published in 1991 in monograph form as Foundations of Accounting, and he finalized his extensive Accounting Thesaurus which was published in 1996, along with publishing several articles in leading accounting journals.  Recognition  Chambers‚Äô received numerous accolades, three honorary doctorates, and induction into Ohio State University's U.S. Accounting Hall of Fame (now part of the American Accounting Association) in 1991. He was the first non-U.S. academic to be inducted. He was an inaugural inductee into the University of Melbourne Australian Accounting Hall of Fame in 2010. Other awards included: in 1958 being the first recipient of the ASA‚Äôs Citation for Meritorious Contribution to the Literature of Accounting, Accounting and Action, and in 1967 the AICPA‚Äôs Gold Medal for outstanding contribution to accounting literature, Accounting, Evaluation and Economic Behavior. In 1978 he was awarded the Order of Australia for services to commerce and education, particularly in accounting and business management.  Personal life  Chambers married Margaret Scott Brown. They had met whilst attending Christadelphian church gatherings. Later, Chambers became an occasional lay-preacher. Ray and Margaret lived together for 60 years, with three children, Margaret, Rosemary, Kevin and several grandchildren.  Selected publications  * Chambers, R. J., 1955.

He claimed to be the Prince of a fictitious microstate known as the Principality of Thomond.  Origin of claims  In 1936 several American newspapers published Raymond Moulton O'Brien's claims to nobility.New Yorker is acknowledged as British earl According to a Time article, his mother claimed that he was conceived by her first husband who was allegedly a claimant to the extinct title of the Earl of Thomond.People, Oct. 12, 1936 O'Brien appealed to the Irish authorities for the recognition of his title and that same year a Mexican court issued a judgement decreeing that he was indeed the Earl of Thomond. This decree was ratified by France, Germany and Luxembourg. Following this, he wrote personally from New York to the Taoiseach of Ireland, √âamon de Valera, asking whether he would be allowed to use the titles of Earl of Thomond and Baron Ibracken. The Irish authorities made inquiries leading Thomas Sadleir of the College of Arms to confirm that O'Brien had no claim to the titles. The next year O'Brien wrote again to de Valera arguing against his refusal to accept O'Brien's claim. Thomas Sadleir was contacted again who told the Irish government that \\"there was nothing in law to prevent a man assuming and bearing any name he wished whether that name be in the form of a title or otherwise, provided that in doing so he did not infringe on the rights of some other individual\\".  The Principality of Thomond  At some point between 1937 and 1944, O'Brien moved from New York to Dublin and became involved with the Irish fascist party Ailtir√≠ na hAis√©irghe.Architects of the Resurrection: Ailtir√≠ na hAis√©irghe and the fascist 'New Order' in Ireland, R.M Douglas, page 155 In 1944 he faked an accusation of slander against him which failed when the Chief Herald noticed that O'Brien was simultaneously plaintiff, defendant and arbitrator.Imposters and pretenders In 1949 he was involved in a court case when he was struck by his neighbour. Later that year on June 17 he was arrested and tried for indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl, however the jury failed to reach a verdict. He was arrested once more the next year on the same charges but was again found not guilty. Around this time O'Brien began claiming to be the Prince of a microstate known as the Principality of Thomond. The Southend Times in Britain published an interview with Count Howard d'Angerville, who had been appointed Honorary Dalcassian Envoy and Minister to England by \\"His Highness Prince O'Brien of Thomond\\". D'Angerville claimed that although the alleged principality's existence was not recognised by either Britain or Ireland it had already been recognised by \\"most of the crowned heads and republics throughout the world\\" including America, Sweden, Denmark, France, Belgium, Latvia and Estonia, despite the latter two nations having been annexed by the Soviet Union. A Belgian newspaper also published an article alleging the existence of the principality. O'Brien's claims continued to deceive many foreign newspapers and diplomats to the consternation of the Department of External Affairs who circulated to all of its missions abroad a statement prepared by the Irish Genealogical Office denying O'Brien's titles and the existence of the principality. Despite this, diplomatic confusion continued to circulate abroad including from the governments of East Germany and Monaco.  Irish United Christian Nationalist Party  In 1951 O'Brien established the Irish United Christian Nationalist Party, modelled on Gerald L. K. Smith's Christian Nationalist Crusade, and announced his intention to protect Ireland from communism by establishing a paramilitary organisation known as the Black Legion. Irish intelligence chief Dan Bryan reported that the party had \\"all the hall-marks of an orthodox Fascist movement\\". However, by January 1953 the Department of Defence announced that the movement had at one time 25 legionaries but was now \\"practically non-existent\\".Douglas (2009), p. 282  Later life and death  O'Brien was eventually confined to a psychiatric hospital in Stillorgan Castle.Some are to the manor born, some buy the title, Irish Independent, 2005 He died in Dublin on 31 March 1977 and was buried in Birmingham.

Early years and education Jeannine Davis-Kimball was born November 23, 1929 in Driggs, Idaho. In 1972, she studied at the Autonomous University of Madrid in Spain. She graduated from California State University, Northridge in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and earned a Ph.D. in 1988 from the University of California, Berkeley. Research and career As a result of her work on her doctoral thesis, she moved to Central Asia in 1985 to study nomads. She became known above all for her research of the \\"Amazon tombs\\" in Southern Russia. In the 1990s, Davis-Kimball and her Russian archeology colleague, Leonid Jablonski, found in southern Russia and Ukraine numerous tombs (kurgans) of Scythian or Sarmatian women who had been buried along with weapons and armor. An important locality is a necropolis at Pokrovka. Davis-Kimball explored areas where there are still women participating in active nomadic culture who shoot with bows and ride regularly. She discovered in Western Mongolia, which is inhabited mainly by Kazakhs, the sought-after genetic traits in women. The nomadic women of this area were experienced archers and riders; their equipment and their jewelry resembled the finds discovered by Davis Kimball in the kurgan.J. Davis-Kimball: Excavations Pokrovka, Russia, 1995. In: csen.org, The Center for the Study of the Eurasian Nomads (CSEN), Berkeley California USA (englisch, abgerufen am 16.

Yablonsky, completed its fourth successful year of excavations at Pokrovka, Russia.‚Äú This was the reason she was looking for \\"living proof of the Amazons\\" in this region. She came across a blonde Kazakh girl named Maryemg√ºl who was already a very good rider at the age of nine. Due to the deviating from the other members of the tribe's phenotype (blond, Central Asian features) of the girl, Davis-Kimball assumed that they have found a descendant of the \\"Amazon women\\". The black-haired mother of the girl also said that every now and then, blonde girls were born in their family and in the surrounding area. To prove their assumptions, Davis-Kimball and Joachim Burger had a genetic test done. They were able to prove that the genetics of the Kazakh girl were almost 100 percent consistent with the genetic profile of the \\"Amazon women\\" discovered in kurgans. The connection of the fabled Amazons to the Kazakh tribe in western Mongolia is not conclusively proven. She died April 3, 2017 in Ventura, California.

He was a member of the powerful K≈ëszegi family. He served as Palatine of Hungary at various times between 1275 and 1298. He was also Ban of Slavonia twice. Albeit he participated in several rebellions against the royal power, he proved to be more moderate and conformist than his younger brothers. He swore loyalty to Andrew III of Hungary after their failed rebellion in 1292. In comparison to the other branches of the K≈ëszegi family, Nicholas' branch remained relatively insignificant, as he did not establish an oligarchic province independently of the king, unlike his brothers. Nicholas was ancestor of the Rohonci family, which flourished until the mid-15th century. Family Nicholas I was born in the 1240s into the wealthy and influential K≈ëszegi family, originating from the gens (clan) H√©der, as the eldest son of the powerful lord Henry I K≈ëszegi. His younger brothers were Ivan, Henry II ‚Äì who were also elevated into high dignities during the age of the late √Årp√°ds ‚Äì and Peter, the Bishop of Veszpr√©m from 1275 till his murder in 1289. His marriage to an unidentified noblewoman produced two sons. The elder one was Nicholas II (also \\"the Rooster\\"), who inherited his domains and became ancestor of the Rohonci family (then Ludbregi), which flourished until the middle of the 15th century, but was declared disgraced by King Sigismund in 1403. According to genealogist P√°l Engel, Nicholas also had another son, John, whose only known son Nicholas was mentioned with the surname \\"B√©ri\\" by a single document in 1368.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus H√©der 4. K≈ëszegi [and Rohonci] branch) Early career Nicholas K≈ëszegi first appeared in contemporary records in March 1265, when he participated in the Battle of Isaszeg alongside his father Henry and brother Ivan. During the civil war between B√©la IV of Hungary and his son Duke Stephen, Nicholas' father was a staunch supporter of the king and led the royal army against the duke. However Stephen gained a decisive victory over his father's army, and Henry K≈ëszegi and his two sons were captured. The K≈ëszegis were being held as prisoners and after the Battle of Isaszeg, B√©la IV was forced to accept the authority of Stephen in the eastern parts of the kingdom. On 23 March 1266, father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on 'Rabbits' Island and Henry and his two sons, alongside others, were released from captivity. When Stephen V ascended the Hungarian throne in May 1270, following his father's death, several barons, including Henry and his sons handed over their castles along the western borders to Ottokar II. They had spent the next two years in exile at Ottokar's court in Prague. Their departure caused a war between Hungary and Bohemia, which lasted until the conclusion of an agreement in Pressburg in July 1271. Henry K≈ëszegi and his sons returned from Bohemia to Hungary following Stephen's death in the summer of 1272. His ten-year-old son Ladislaus IV ascended the throne. During his minority, many groupings of barons fought against each other for supreme power. The arriving Henry K≈ëszegi brutally murdered Ladislaus' cousin, B√©la of Macs√≥, the only adult male member of the √Årp√°d dynasty. The K≈ëszegis entered alliance with the Gutkeleds and the Geregyes, forming one of the two main baronial groups (the other one was dominated by the Cs√°k and Monoszl√≥ clans). Nicholas' father became a key figure in the early stage of the era of so-called feudal anarchy. When Henry extended his dominance in the royal council, Nicholas served as isp√°n of Szana County in Lower Slavonia, from 1273 to 1274, where his father acted as ban. Subsequently, Nicholas was styled as isp√°n of Rojcsa (today Rovi≈°ƒáe, Croatia), which laid in the territory of Kri≈æevci (K≈ër√∂s) County, in the period between 1274 and 1279. In late September 1274, Peter Cs√°k defeated the united forces of the K≈ëszegis and the Gutkeleds at the Battle of F√∂veny. Henry K≈ëszegi was killed, but his sons Nicholas and Ivan managed to flee the battlefield, withdrawing their troops to the borderlands between Hungary and Austria. Thereafter Peter Cs√°k and the young Ladislaus IV gathered an army against the K≈ëszegis' domain in the autumn of 1274; their troops marched into Western Hungary, pillaging the brothers' landholdings. Nicholas and Ivan barricaded themselves in the castle of Szal√≥nak (present-day Stadtschlaining, Austria). The royal army besieged the fort, but failed to capture it because of the coming winter. Through his ambitious and unscrupulous sons, the K≈ëszegi family survived their paterfamilias' death. Powerful baron =Rebellions against Ladislaus IV= Despite their violent actions against the monarch, the K≈ëszegis regained their influence and retook the power by the spring of 1275, when Nicholas became Palatine, the most prestigious position, while his younger brother Ivan was made Ban of Slavonia. Beside his dignity, Nicholas also functioned as isp√°n of Sopron County. Nicholas' appointment as Palatine marked a turning point in the history of the feudal anarchy. Prior to that, the rivaling baronial groups delegated elderly honored barons to the office, for instance, Denis P√©c or Roland R√°t√≥t. After 1275, when Nicholas broke this \\"tradition\\", the leading members of the two major \\"parties\\" have now placed themselves in this dignity. As Palatine, Nicholas confirmed the previous royal donation and ceded the twentieth tithe of Sopron County to the Cistercian monastery at Borsmonostor (today Klostermarienberg, a borough of Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz in Austria). Nicholas lost his dignity by the autumn of 1275, when the Cs√°ks retook the positions in the royal council. Thereafter the Cs√°k group launched a massive military campaign against the K≈ëszegi and Gutkeled dominions; Peter Cs√°k's troops devastated Veszpr√©m, the episcopal see of Peter K≈ëszegi, Nicholas' brother. Joachim Gutkeled and the K≈ëszegis again removed their opponents from power at an assembly of the barons and noblemen at Buda around 21 June 1276. Subsequently, Nicholas was styled as Palatine of Hungary and isp√°n of Moson and Sopron counties until the next year. Burg Lockenhaus (L√©ka), owned by Nicholas K≈ëszegi and his descendants until the early 14th century The K≈ëszegis' ally Joachim Gutkeled died while battling against the Baboniƒái in April 1277. A month later, the general assembly declared Ladislaus IV to be of age, who was also authorized to restore internal peace with all possible means. These events ended the five-year chaotic conditions in the realm. The K≈ëszegis and the Baboniƒái divided the Gutkeled's province between each other on the border of Transdanubia and Slavonia. Sometimes in the second half of the 1270s, Nicholas and Ivan handed over the family's landholdings in Vara≈ædin County to their much younger brother Henry. In the course of the division of lands between the two elder brothers in 1279, Ivan was granted K≈ëszeg, Borosty√°nk≈ë (present-day Bernstein, Austria) and S√°rv√°r, while Szentvid and L√©ka (present-day Lockenhaus, Austria) went to Nicholas' property. In the upcoming decades, Nicholas K≈ëszegi extended his influence in Southwest Transdanubia, acquiring large-scale landholdings and villages, although in a more moderate way in comparison to his younger brothers, Ivan and Henry, who were among the most powerful oligarchs in the kingdom by the end of the 13th century. Sometimes before 1292, Nicholas seized the castle of P√∂l√∂ske from Nicholas Hah√≥t. The latter's brother Arnold Hah√≥t unsuccessfully tried to recover the fort in that year. Nicholas also acquired some estates in Upper Slavonia and the castle of Rohonc in Vas County (present-day Rechnitz in Austria), where his namesake son resided permanently and his descendants took their surname after this fort, which beforehand belonged to Cs√©p√°n J√°k, who died without heirs. It is also plausible he built and owned the castle of Kanizsa in Zala County. The ruins of the castle of Rechnitz (Rohonc), owned by Nicholas K≈ëszegi and his descendants until the early 15th century From 1277, the K≈ëszegi family was in rebellion against Ladislaus IV; the politically motivated Ivan K≈ëszegi even invited the king's distant relative Andrew the Venetian to the Hungarian throne in 1278. However the victory over Ottokar II in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August strengthened Ladislaus' domestic political positions. Thereafter the K≈ëszegi brothers pledged allegiance to Ladislaus IV in early 1279. Nicholas served as Ban of Slavonia from the autumn of 1280 to 1281. In this capacity, he and his two brothers plundered the estates of the Diocese of Zagreb at various times in the following months. As a result, Timothy, Bishop of Zagreb excommunicated them in March 1281. At the end of 1283, Ladislaus IV again led an unsuccessful campaign against Ivan K≈ëszegi's forts. Along with his brothers, Nicholas provided help to Ivan. Having Ladislaus failed, Nicholas, Henry and Bishop Peter stormed into Southern Transdanubia and jointly invaded and besieged the episcopal town of P√©cs in March 1284. Following his failure, Ladislaus had to reconcile with the K≈ëszegi brothers in the spring of 1284. Nicholas was made Palatine for the third time in his career; beside that he was also isp√°n of Pozsony County. He held both offices until at least December 1285. Palatine Nicholas had no own literate staff, as his charter was issued by the royal chancellery at the legislative day of 20 August 1284. In 1285, when Albert I, Duke of Austria led his forces against Ivan's province after his series of looting and pillaging raids, and intended to besiege Borosty√°nk≈ë Castle, Ivan again sought assistance from Nicholas, Peter and Henry, who recruited an army of 1,000 people. In order to eliminate the powerful barons' influence over the royal council, Ladislaus managed a self-coup in September 1286, expelling members of the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìBorsa baronial group from the government body. Also Neglecting the K≈ëszegis' aristocratic rivals, the king appointed his own loyal soldiers and lesser nobles to the high positions. It is possible that Nicholas also lost his both offices during that time. Thereafter Ladislaus IV launched his fifth and last royal campaign against the K≈ëszegi territory in November 1286. The king seized K≈ëszeg, but Ivan managed to escape. Simultaneously, on the northern front of the war, Nicholas K≈ëszegi and Apor P√©c besieged and captured Pressburg Castle, devastating the surrounding region (the castle was only recovered to the royal crown in the next year). The Borsas' troops arrived from Transtisia; they joint troops defeated Ladislaus' army at the river Zsitva (≈Ωitava) in March. After a new reconciliation, Nicholas K≈ëszegi was appointed Ban of Slavonia, he was first mentioned in this capacity in June 1287. Ivan's continuous looting raids in Austria and Styria resulted a large- scale war (\\"G√ºssing Feud\\"; ) with Duke Albert throughout in 1289. The Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses and settlements along the western borders from the K≈ëszegis, including Nicholas' two castles, Rohonc (May) and Szentvid (December). Nicholas K≈ëszegi held the dignity of Palatine, according to a charter issued on 8 September 1289. As another document, which was transcribed in the next day, refers to Reynold B√°szt√©ly as an incumbent palatine, historian Gyula Pauler argued there were two palatines in the kingdom simultaneously during that time, as a precursor of the established political administration during the late reign of Andrew III. However historian Attila Zsoldos questioned Pauler's theory, proving that the royal charter, which issued on 9 September, and its transcribed version on 30 September were non-authentic. Historian Tibor Sz≈ëcs considers that Nicholas K≈ëszegi arbitrarily used the title of Palatine in September 1289, without the recognition of the monarch. He argues some texts of the non-authentic charters from that period were based on authentic documents. Nicholas was styled as isp√°n of Somogy County from 1289 to 1295. =Fluctuate relationship with Andrew III= The K≈ëszegi family supported the claim of Andrew the Venetian to the Hungarian throne since early 1290. Ladislaus IV was assassinated by his Cuman subjects in July 1290. Andrew III was crowned king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r some weeks later. Along with his brothers, Nicholas hoped that Andrew would recover their family's lost landholdings and forts from Duke Albert. He was made Palatine of Hungary around February 1291, replacing Amadeus Aba, who was sent to Poland to lead auxiliary troops to assist W≈Çadys≈Çaw the Short in his unification war. Nicholas participated in the campaign against Austria. However, the Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert had seized from the K≈ëszegis, which was in the interests of both monarchs. The K≈ëszegis were outraged at Andrew's move. Nicholas lost his dignity by the end of the year. After a few months of tension, the K≈ëszegi brothers rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging the late Ladislaus' nephew, Charles Martel of Anjou, as King of Hungary. While Ivan plundered the royal estates in Transdanubia, Nicholas stormed and captured the castles of Pressburg and Detrek≈ë (present-day near Plaveck√© Podhradie in Slovakia) with his army. He also started to besiege the fort of Szenic in Nyitra County (present-day Senica, Slovakia), but Andrew III sent a relief army and successfully forced Nicholas' troops to retreat. Subsequently, the royal army recaptured Pressburg and Detrek≈ë with the leadership of Matthew Cs√°k and subdued the rebellion by July. Nicholas K≈ëszegi besieged and occupied Bratislava Castle (Pressburg) twice: in 1286 and 1292, for a brief time in both occasions There was a turning point in his political orientation after 1292. Nicholas did not support his younger brother, the more unscrupulous Ivan, who captured and imprisoned Andrew III during his journey to Slavonia for a brief time in August 1292. Nicholas involved in resolving the crisis and was among those loyal barons and nobles who sent their relatives or familiares as hostages to Ivan in order to liberate Andrew III. While Ivan K≈ëszegi remained rebellious for the remaining part of the reign of Andrew, Nicholas pledged allegiance to the monarch after their failed rebellion, thus their political orientations had gradually separated from each other. Nicholas K≈ëszegi served as Palatine of Hungary at least from the first half of 1294 to the summer of 1295. He was also referred to as isp√°n of Fej√©r County by multiple documents in 1295. In that year, Nicholas K≈ëszegi and Paul Balog, the Bishop of P√©cs assisted Queen Mother Tomasina Morosini to expel the rebellious Mizse, a former Palatine from the castle of Szekcs≈ë in Baranya County, after having seized that by enforcement from the queen. They successfully besieged and captured Szekcs≈ë and handed it over to Tomasina. After a short interruption, Nicholas K≈ëszegi again functioned as Palatine, according to a sole document from May 1296. According to historian Attila Zsoldos, there was an agreement between the powerful Aba and K≈ëszegi families in the first regnal years of Andrew III; the position of Palatine rotated among them in the summer of every years. Andrew III married Agnes, the daughter of Duke Albert of Austria in February 1296. Afterwards, with his father-in-law's support, Andrew tried to eliminate the K≈ëszegis' power and launched another war against the family in August 1296. While the Austrian troops besieged Ivan K≈ëszegi's some castles, Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated the brothers, including Nicholas. By October, the royal army managed to capture only K≈ëszeg and two other forts from Ivan K≈ëszegi. During the royal campaign, Nicholas successfully defended Somogyv√°r against Andrew's army. After Andrew's failure, the king reconciled with Nicholas sometimes after May 1297, while Lodomer also absolved him from the excommunication. After Matthew Cs√°k's rebellion in late August 1297, Andrew III restored the dual system and Nicholas K≈ëszegi and Amadeus Aba were appointed co-palatines of the kingdom. Nicholas was responsible for the Cisdanubian region (). In the contemporary context, this meant that he had jurisdiction over Western Hungary in this capacity, while Amadeus Aba supervised the counties in Eastern Hungary (as \\"Transdanubia\\" had a different meaning than present days). They held their dignity until June 1298. When Nicholas attended the diet of 1298, he was already referred to as \\"former\\" Palatine. Nicholas was also a participant of the diet, held in the summer of 1299, where his younger brother Henry pledged allegiance to the monarch too. Nicholas died by the end of 1299.

The fort was named for the area's Powhatan tribe of indigenous people; the name is also an English term for their leader. It is on the south bank of the James River, sited to prevent enemy vessels proceeding upriver to Richmond. The first fort on the site was a two-gun battery called Hood's Battery, built in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War and named after the owner of the plantation it was on. In January 1781, British forces under Benedict Arnold attacked and dismantled the battery and went on to burn Richmond. Later that year a larger fort was built, named Fort Hood (or Fort at Hood's Bluff). In 1808 this was replaced by the federal government with Fort Powhatan, part of what was later called the second system of US fortifications. The fort was not attacked in the War of 1812. In 1862, during the American Civil War, Confederate forces added a new earthwork battery on the site; the fort area was captured by Union forces in 1863. The fort was abandoned at the end of the war in 1865.Fort Powhatan at American Forts NetworkFort Powhatan at FortWiki.com American Revolution As part of the American Revolutionary War, in May 1779 the British Chesapeake raid under Commodore Sir George Collier caused Virginia's Revolutionary government to strengthen its defenses. Among these efforts was Hood's Battery, a two-gun earthwork on the south bank of the James River at John Hood's plantation, at Windmill Hill (also called Hood's Bluff) in Prince George County, Virginia. This battery was inadequate to prevent the burning of Richmond by British forces under Benedict Arnold in January 1781; the British successfully attacked the battery on their way upriver on 3 January, and captured and dismantled it on their way back on 10 January, despite being ambushed by a force under George Rogers Clark.Historic markers at vcris.dhr.virginia.gov A larger fortification named Fort Hood (or Fort at Hood's Bluff) was built on the site beginning later that year. It was an earthwork, possibly reinforced with brick, and had eight heavy guns facing the river, a redoubt with at least two field guns for land defense, and a garrison of 60 men. The fort was not begun until late 1781, two months after British general Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, and was never attacked. 1783 through War of 1812 In 1808 a new masonry fort was built by the federal government on the site of Fort Hood, as part of what was later termed the second system of US fortifications. It was named Fort Powhatan, and was designed for 13 guns with a blockhouse and a detached water battery (a battery near the river). The engineer in charge was Captain Walker K. Armistead. In the Army report on fortifications for December 1808, the water battery is described as \\"a strong battery of mason work has been erected\\", and the \\"regular enclosed work\\" was \\"in considerable forwardness...\\". Although incomplete, the fort was used as a district headquarters for coastal forts in Virginia by Colonel Edward Pasteur in 1809. The star fort (with a semi- circular water battery) was still incomplete in 1811 (though barracks for one company were complete), and was not armed until the War of 1812 broke out. By 1814 the fort had 22 artillery pieces. It was not attacked in the war, and by 1830 was no longer reported to be in use. American Civil War During the Civil War, the Confederate government built a new battery on the bluff above the fort in 1862. The Union captured the battery in 1863, and in 1864 a garrison of U.S. Colored Troops repulsed a Confederate cavalry attack led by Fitzhugh Lee. The fort was abandoned after the war. Present The fort is now the private property of a gun club. The brick magazines, water battery, and Civil War battery still exist.

Moran (April 27, 1859 ‚Äì February 6, 1909) was an American politician who served as District Attorney of Suffolk County, Massachusetts from 1905 to 1909. Early life Moran was born on April 27, 1859 in Wakefield, Massachusetts to John and Ellen (Brown) Moran, Irish immigrants who moved to the United States in 1852. He worked his way through school and took three years worth of courses in one year at Boston University Law School. He opened a small law office in Woburn, Massachusetts, but moved to Roxbury after six months due to slow business. Political career =Early involvement= After moving to Roxbury, Moran became involved in local politics. During the 1892 election he took the stump for Timothy V. Coakley, Democratic nominee in the Massachusetts Senate's 8th Suffolk District. During the 1895 Boston mayoral election, Moran and Coakley ended up on the opposite sides, with Moran supporting Democrat Josiah Quincy and Coakley supporting Republican Edwin Upton Curtis. The two engaged in a joint debate in front of 4,000 people at the Boston Music Hall. In the 1897 mayoral election, Moran broke with Quincy and supported Thomas Riley, an attorney who as the candidate of the Bryan Democrats, a group of Boston Democrats who \\"repudiated the Chicago platform\\". =District Attorney= In 1898, Moran severely criticized Suffolk County District Attorney Oliver Stevens, who was running for reelection. Moran accused Stevens and his assistants of making decisions based on political influence, requesting unjust sentences, shielding perjurers, and other misdeeds. Stevens was reelected and on March 13, 1899, Moran announced that he would no longer serve as counsel in cases in the Suffolk County Criminal Court, as be believed his opposition to Stevens' reelection made it impossible for him to try cases in that court. Stevens resigned in 1905 and Moran challenged his appointed successor, Michael J. Sughrue. Sughrue won both the Republican and Democratic nominations, but Moran chose to stay in the race as an independent. Moran ran on a platform opposing graft and, following the death of Susie Geary, vowed to close down abortion clinics. He had no campaign committee, funds, or staff, but upset Sughrue by 4,349 votes to become DA. The New York Times compared his victory to that of William Travers Jerome. He was sworn into office on December 2. Soon after taking office, Moran closed an investigation into alleged plot to kill Martin Lomasney due to a lack of evidence. He also began a crackdown on Boston hotels. He forced the Boston Police Commission to revoke the Hotel Touraine's liquor license for violating a law that prevented the sale of liquor on Sunday. He also demanded that licenses be stripped from Young's Hotel, Parker House, Adams House, and the Hotel Essex for violating the \\"Screen Law\\", which prohibited obstructions to view on premises where liquor is sold. The board elected to suspend instead of revoking these licenses. =Run for Governor= On June 28, 1906, Moran won the Prohibition Party's nomination for Governor of Massachusetts. On July 14 he announced that he would seek the Democratic Party's nomination as well. He wanted to create a fusion ticket with anti-machine Republicans and requested the Democrats nominate Republican Eugene N. Foss for Lieutenant Governor. On September 22 he received the nomination of the Independence League, the state's newest political organization. By September 26, Moran had such a large lead in Democratic delegate count that leaders of conservative wing of the party decided that they would not present their candidate, Henry Melville Whitney, at the convention. On October 4, Moran was nominated without opposition at the Democratic convention. The convention also nominated William Jennings Bryan for president, which led to speculation that Moran, who opposed both Bryan and the party's other presidential frontrunner, William Randolph Hearst, would decline the party's nomination. However, on October 12, he announced that he accepted the Democratic nomination in a statement in which he also denounced \\"Bryanism and Hearstism\\". On October 18, Moran announced that if he was elected and reelected in 1907, he would challenged both Bryan and Hearst at the 1908 Democratic National Convention. Moran did not appear at the 1906 Democratic convention due to ill health. His physician informed him that an active campaign, along with working full-time as District Attorney, would result in permanent injury to his already frail condition. Against doctor's advice made multiple speeches a night. He took small quantities of strychnine and coated his throat with cocaine in order to \\"keep up the action of the heart\\". On October 16 he fainted following a 55-minute speech at Faneuil Hall. On election day, Moran left Boston in order to rest. Moran lost to Republican Curtis Guild Jr. 52% to 44%. =Reelection as District Attorney= Following his defeat in the gubernatorial election, Moran considered running for Governor, Mayor of Boston, or District Attorney in 1907. On March 28, 1907, Moran announced that he would run for reelection as Suffolk County District Attorney. His former lead assistant, Joseph A. Dennison decided to challenge Moran for the Democratic nomination. Dennision defeated Moran 108 to 72 votes at the party convention to win the nomination. However, Moran received the unanimous endorsement of the Independence League. Due to a throat condition, Moran did not make any speeches during the campaign. He was easily reelected, receiving 50,345 votes to the Republican nominee Walter A. Webster's 22,725 and Dennison's 17,932. Illness and death From January to February 1908, Moran was a patient at the Fenway Hospital. He then spent several weeks in Waynesville, North Carolina. On June 10 he announced that he had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and needed a change of climate. He left for a sanatorium in Adirondacks on June 12. He was confident that he would recover from the disease and would one day become Governor. He returned to Massachusetts briefly in July but soon moved on to Denver and later Arizona. On February 6, 1909, Moran died in Phoenix, Arizona.

Ceramics resulting from the pyrolysis of preceramic polymers are known as polymer derived ceramics, or PDCs. Polymer derived ceramics are most often silicon based and include silicon carbide, silicon oxycarbide, silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride. Such PDCs are most commonly amorphous, lacking long-range crystalline order. Wang X. et al.

For example, the spinning of fibres, casting of thin films and the molding of complex shapes. Commonly used preceramic polymers include polycarbosilanes and polysiloxanes, which transform through pyrolysis to SiC and SiOC type ceramics respectively. Ceramic Forming Polymers Starfire Systems Through photopolymerization methods, preceramic polymers can be used in stereolithography approaches, enabling the additive manufacturing of complex shaped ceramic objects. In such methods, by means of irradiation-driven cross- linking, liquid preceramic polymers transform into rigid thermoset polymers that preserve their shape through the following polymer-to-ceramic transformation that takes place in pyrolysis.

The magazine's motto is \\"A queer magazine for butch dykes, butch lesbians, butch women, trans butches, non-binary butches & all those who love them.\\" History The magazine was founded in Melbourne, Australia in March 2017 as a not-for-profit project dedicated to butch lesbians and \\"masculine-of-center\\" women in Australia and throughout the world. The magazine is edited by pro-skateboarder Esther Godoy and was inspired by the San Francisco photographer Meg Allen's photo series \\"Butch\\". Godoy has said her experience of immigrating from Melbourne to Portland, Oregon helped inspire her to create the magazine, because it was in Portland that she first felt accepted as a butch lesbian. The magazine aims to reclaim the word \\"butch\\", provide more positive representation for butch lesbians and masculine-presenting women, and expand the butch lesbian community in Australia. Godoy has stated that the purpose of Butch Is Not A Dirty Word is about ‚Äúbreaking up the ideal that masculinity and femininity have to belong to male or female. Female masculinity is just as valid as male masculinity. It‚Äôs not really bound to your sex or gender. Yet it‚Äôs surprising how much of a taboo it still is, when you look like a guy but you‚Äôre a girl.‚Äù BINADW aims to combat lesbian invisibility and dispel the lesbophobic and ageist \\"old butch dyke\\" trope that associates being butch with \\"aggression, ugliness, and loneliness.\\" Among the many issues that BINADW explores is ageism within lesbian communities. The third issue of the magazine was \\"dedicated to exploring the experiences and perspectives of Butches of all ages\\" so as to acknowledge and honor \\"the road that our Butch Elders have paved for us, and how their contributions have created a safer space for queers to exist and thrive.\\" BINADW contributors include Jewel Robinson, Leah Peterson, and Avery Everhart.

The attack took place on the last day of the Jewish Passover holiday, which fell on a Shabbat. One woman was killed and three other people were injured, including the synagogue's rabbi. After fleeing the scene, the alleged gunman phoned 9-1-1 and reported the shooting. He was apprehended in his car approximately from the synagogue by a San Diego police officer. After arraignment in late 2019, Earnest was scheduled to be tried on multiple state charges in June 2020; the state announced it was seeking the death penalty. The federal government had also filed charges based on hate crimes. His defense attorney was expected to ask for more time to prepare to respond to the state's seeking the death penalty. The jury trial was supposed to start in June 2020 but due to COVID-19 it's been delayed until at least March 15, 2021.  Attack  At approximately 11:23 a.m. PDT, a gunman identified as 19-year-old John Timothy Earnest allegedly entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue on the last day of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which fell on a Shabbat. Approximately 100 people were inside the synagogue. The gunman carried a Smith & Wesson Model M&P; 15 Sport II semiautomatic rifle and was wearing a tactical vest containing five magazines of ten rounds each. In the foyer, the gunman shot and killed 60-year-old Lori Gilbert-Kaye, and then wounded Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who had founded the congregation. According to witnesses, Gilbert-Kaye had tried to shield the rabbi from the gunman. The gunman turned to a side room occupied by several people, including a number of children. He fired into the room, wounding one man with a bullet to the leg, and his 8-year-old niece. All the injured were expected to recover. Goldstein lost his right index finger from the shooting, despite four hours of surgery. After the gunman fled, Goldstein spoke to the congregation despite his injury, telling them to stay strong. The shooter fired eight to ten rounds before his rifle jammed or malfunctioned, which prevented his creating additional casualties.Julia Wick, Sarah Parvini & Doug Smith, Rabbi says synagogue gunman‚Äôs weapon jammed, preventing 'a blood bath', Los Angeles Times (April 28, 2019). Two members of the congregation ran toward the shooter. The suspect fled the synagogue, entering a Honda sedan. Jonathan Morales, an off-duty United States Border Patrolman who was a member of the synagogue, opened fire and hit the suspect's car multiple times, but the suspect fled uninjured. Shortly thereafter, the suspect phoned 9-1-1 and reported the shooting himself. Earnest was apprehended approximately from the synagogue by a San Diego police officer responding to the shooting. Earnest left his car and surrendered, and was taken into custody without incident. The rifle, a tactical helmet, and five loaded magazines with 50 rounds, were recovered from Earnest's car; Earnest was wearing a tactical vest when he was arrested. Surveillance cameras at the synagogue captured video of the shooting. The attack occurred exactly six months after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.  Suspect  The San Diego County Sheriff's Department identified the suspect as John Timothy Earnest (born June 8, 1999), a 19-year- old male from the San Diego suburb of Rancho Pe√±asquitos. He was a 2017 graduate of Mt. Carmel High School and a nursing school student at California State University San Marcos. Officials said he had no previous criminal record or contacts with police, and no known connection to any white supremacist group. The shooter apparently attempted to livestream the shooting on Facebook, but failed. An anti-semitic and racist open letter was posted on 8chan shortly before the shooting and signed with Earnest's name. It said that Jews were preparing a \\"meticulously planned genocide of the European race\\", a white genocide conspiracy theory. In the alleged shooter's manifesto, he denied that he had learned anti-semitic beliefs from his family. Earnest is believed to have written the letter, in which he cited shooters Brenton Tarrant and Robert Bowers for their involvement in the Christchurch mosque shootings and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, respectively. He said that Jesus, Paul the Apostle, Martin Luther, Adolf Hitler, Ludwig van Beethoven, \\"Moon Man\\" and Pink Guy were figures who inspired him to commit the shooting. Earnest made a joking mention of PewDiePie and referenced \\"The Day of the Rope\\", an event from William Luther Pierce's neo-Nazi novel The Turner Diaries (1978), in which African Americans and Hispanics are executed and urged more violent attacks. He condemned President Donald Trump as a pro-Zionist traitor. In what officials called a manifesto, Earnest claimed responsibility for the March 2019 Escondido mosque fire, which took place about from Poway. That arson attempt was extinguished with only minor damage to the building and no injuries; graffiti left in the parking lot referred to the earlier Christchurch shooting in New Zealand. Earnest was a member of the Escondido Orthodox Presbyterian Church, which is affiliated with the theologically traditionalist Orthodox Presbyterian Church. According to The Washington Post, the shooter's manifesto, which expressed Christian motives for killing Jews, resulted in a social media debate among Christian pastors. Rev. Duke Kwon of the Presbyterian Church in America said that the manifesto contains \\"a frighteningly clear articulation of Christian theology\\" on certain issues such as salvation, and warned, \\"There‚Äôs a deep and ugly history of anti-Semitism that‚Äôs crept into the Christian church, that needs to be continuously addressed, condemned and corrected.\\" Other ministers strongly denied that Christian theology and scripture offer any support for anti-semitism. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church issued a statement that \\"[a]nti-Semitism and racist hatred which apparently motivated the shooter . . . have no place within our system of doctrine.\\"  Legal proceedings  On April 30, 2019, Earnest was charged in San Diego County Superior Court with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder. All four charges included \\"hate- crime and gun allegations\\", which can incur more severe penalties upon conviction. The murder charge includes a \\"special circumstance\\" that Earnest intentionally killed his victim (Gilbert-Kaye) because of her religion, which could incur the death penalty under California law. Earnest pleaded not guilty to all the charges. A criminal complaint was also filed charging Earnest with arson of a house of worship, a reference to the March arson attempt against a mosque in Escondido. Earnest was ordered held without bail. A trial readiness hearing was scheduled for May 30 and a preliminary hearing for July 8. On May 14, Earnest was arraigned in US District Court in San Diego on 109 federal charges: 54 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs using a dangerous weapon resulting in death, bodily injury and attempts to kill; 54 counts of hate crimes under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act; and one count of damage to a religious property using fire for an earlier arson at Dar-ul-Arquam mosque in Escondido on March 24. Earnest is represented by a federal public defender. On December 5, the court announced a trial date of June 2, 2020. This date may change pending a decision by the San Diego County District Attorney's office on whether to seek the death penalty. Prosecutors scheduled a press conference to discuss trial details on March 5. It was later announced that San Diego County District Attorney's office is currently seeking the death penalty for John Earnest.

She received her M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Cornell University under the supervision of Robert Buhrman in 1978 and 1982, respecviely. Her graduate research was in the area of thin film composites. During her doctoral work she held a Bell Laboratories Graduate Research Program for Women grant, and spent two summers working at Bell Labs.  Research and career  Gibson was appointed to the faculty of the University of Arizona, working in the Optical Sciences Center. She was made associate professor at the University of Arizona. In 1990 Gibson returned to the faculty in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. Here she taught materials science and nanotechnology. She was elected to the board of directors of The Optical Society in 2002. Ursula Gibson, at the NTNU, Faculty of Natural Sciences Gibson joined the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in 2010. She is an adjunct professor at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology. She was elected to the International Commission on Optics Bureau in 2011. She works on optical materials and nanostructures, with a focus on photovoltaic cells. Gibson's research on optical materials has been wide ranging, including polymers, protein crystals and semiconductors, with an emphasis on limited dimension structures such as thin films and waveguides. She holds three patents and has authored 7 book contributions and over 100 refereed journal articles with 2300 citations. Prof. Gibson‚Äôs present research is focused on semiconductor-core optical fibers and MBE-grown films for mid-infrared applications. Gibson works on novel core optical fibres made from group IV and III-V semiconductors.https://doi.org/10.1364/OME.8.001435 These contain semiconductors with nonlinear optical and electro-optic materials, which can be produced in bulk quantities. The fibres have low thermal mass and good aspect ratios, which allow for laser heat treatment that results in recrystallization and spatial segregation of alloy constituents. This allowed Gibson to specify where the germanium is located throughout crystalline SiGe core fibres. Rapid cooling allows the mixture to form a single crystal, which is optimised for optical transmission. Together with physicist Zahra Ghadyani, Gibson founded the company NorFib to commercialize a fiber-based system for generating electricity with solar energy. In 2017 she was elected to Academia Net by the Swedish Research Council. Gibson was elected to be the 2019 president of The Optical Society. Gibson has held visiting positions at the United States Air Force Academy, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Tampere University of Technology (Finland), Chalmers University (Sweden), and the University of Queensland (Australia), among others. She has served as a consultant for many enterprises, including Kodak Inc., the US Department of Defense and the American University of Kuwait.

Founded in 1986, it includes a 770-seat sanctuary, preschool, afternoon Hebrew school, senior center, library, and mikveh, serving the Jewish communities of Poway and Rancho Bernardo. On April 27, 2019, the synagogue was the site of a shooting in which one person was killed and three were injured. History Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein in 2010 Chabad of Poway was founded in 1986 by Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, a 24-year-old shaliach from Brooklyn, New York, and his new wife Devorie. The congregation first met in a storefront in the Rancho Bernardo shopping center, and then moved to a one- acre site where it opened a preschool in mobile trailers. A senior center was opened in 1990. In 1997, the synagogue built a community center containing a 770-seat sanctuary, preschool, afternoon Hebrew school, senior center, library, mikveh, and meeting rooms. Shluchim Rabbi Mendy and Bluma Rubenfeld joined the staff of Chabad of Poway in 2005. In 2006, Goldstein was named the Jewish chaplain for the Poway Sheriff's Department. In 2010, the synagogue enhanced its security measures by applying for and receiving a $75,000 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It used the funds to add \\"security systems and alarms, a security assessment and installation of 16 cameras, fencing and lighting\\". In May 2018, the synagogue applied for a $150,000 FEMA grant to install gates and more secure doors. This grant was approved in September 2018, but the funds were not released until March 2019, one month before the shooting. On July 14, 2020, Goldstein pleaded guilty to tax and wire fraud for allegedly misusing at least $6.2 million in contributions and donations to the Chabad of Poway. According to a charge sheet filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Goldstein and five others had participated in elaborate tax fraud schemes using the synagogue's charitable status since the mid-1980s. In one scheme, Goldstein re-routed tax-deductible donations to the synagogue back to the donors, keeping a portion for himself. He also laundered illicit gains through the purchase of gold coins. The FBI and IRS began investigating the case in 2016 and Goldstein reportedly was planning to plead guilty to the charges in October 2018. After making his guilty plea in 2020, Goldstein returned $1 million in gold coins to the government and will be expected to pay $2.5 million in restitution to the IRS. The district attorney's office said it would recommend probation rather than a maximum five-year prison sentence, due to Goldstein's cooperation with investigators and his \\"lifetime of service\\" to the synagogue and community. Upon learning of the case in late 2019, the synagogue removed Goldstein from his rabbinical position and the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters in Crown Heights, New York, \\"dismissed him from his position as a representative of the movement\\". In November 2019, Goldstein's son, Rabbi Mendel Goldstein, took over the day-to-day rabbinic duties of the congregation. Shooting On April 27, 2019, John T. Earnest, a 19-year-old male from the San Diego suburb of Rancho Pe√±asquitos, allegedly entered the synagogue building during services on the last day of the Jewish Passover holiday and opened fire in the foyer. One woman, 60-year-old Lori Gilbert-Kaye, was killed and three other people were wounded, including Goldstein. According to witnesses, Gilbert-Kaye had tried to shield Goldstein from the gunfire. The shooter's gun jammed after releasing ten bulletsJulia Wick, Sarah Parvini & Doug Smith, Rabbi says synagogue gunman‚Äôs weapon jammed, preventing 'a blood bath', Los Angeles Times (April 28, 2019). and two congregants, one an off-duty United States Border Patrol officer, chased him out of the building. A short while later, Earnest called 911 and reported the shooting. He was apprehended approximately from the synagogue. The suspect had an AR-style rifle in his possession at the time of his arrest and had made many antisemitic and anti-Muslim comments.

Dykes & Gorgons also encouraged lesbian-feminists to reject traditional femininity, advocating that women reject restrictive female clothing and cut their hair short as an expression of feminism and lesbian visibility: \\"The time has come to stop blending in with the 'feminized' masses of women, to stop being that invisible minority.\\" Many members of Dykes & Gorgons chose to reject submissive femininity by eschewing purses, blouses, and heels, wearing practical clothing instead, often men's clothing, such as Levi jeans with pockets and men's boots. One member explained that the intent was to empower women rather than imitate men: \\"It wasn't a masculine image I was keeping. It was convenience and practicality.

Transition metal amino acid complexes are a large family of coordination complexes containing the conjugate bases of the amino acids, the 2-aminocarboxylates. Amino acids are prevalent in nature, and all of them function as ligands toward the transition metals. Not included in this article are complexes of the amides (including peptide) and ester derivatives of amino acids. Also excluded are the polyamino acids including the chelating agents EDTA and NTA. :420 px Binding modes Three ways 2-amino carboxylate bind metal ions. Most commonly, amino acids coordinate to metal ions as N,O bidentate ligands, utilizing the amino group and the carboxylate. They are \\"L-X\\" ligands. A five-membered chelate ring is formed. The chelate ring is only slightly ruffled at the sp3-hybridized carbon and nitrogen centers. For those amino acids containing coordinating substituents, the resulting complexes are more structurally diverse since these substituents can coordinate. Histidine, aspartic acid, methionine, and cysteine sometimes form tridentate N,N,O, N,O,O, S,N,O, and S,N,O complexes, respectively. Using kinetically inert metal ions, complexes containing monodentate amino acids have been characterized. These complexes exist in either the N or the O linkage isomers. It can be assumed that such monodentate complexes exist transiently for many kinetically labile metal ions (e.g. Zn2+). Stoichiometry and structure Structure of Co(glycinate)3. =Homoleptic complexes (only amino acid ligands)= Mixing simple metal salts with solutions of amino acids near neutral or elevated pH often affords bis- or tris complexes. For metal ions that prefer octahedral coordination, these complexes often adopt the stoichiometry M(aa)3 (aa = amino carboxylate, such as glycinate, H2NCH2CO2‚àí). Complexes of the 3:1 stoichiometry have the formula is [M(O2CC(R)HNH2)3]z. Such complexes adopt octahedral coordination geometry. These complexes can exist in facial and meridional isomers, both of which are chiral. The stereochemical possibilities increase when the amino acid ligands are not homochiral. Complexes with the 2:1 stoichiometry are illustrated by copper(II) glycinate [Cu(O2CC(R)HNH2)2], which exists both in anhydrous and pentacoordinate geometries. When the metal is square planar, these complexes can exist as cis and trans isomers. The stereochemical possibilities increase when the amino acid ligands are not homochiral. Homoleptic complexes are also known where the amino carboxylate is tridentate amino acids. One such complex is Ni(Œ∫3-histidinate)2. Structure of Ni(Œ∫3-histidinate)2. =Heteroleptic complexes (amino acids plus other ligands)= Structure of [Cp*Ir(Œ∫3-methionine)]+. Mixed ligand complexes are common for amino acids.

He has been recognized as one of the South's leading liberals during his time. Dabbs was cited in Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail as a Southern writer who wrote about the struggle of African Americans in \\"eloquent and prophetic terms.\\" He has also been called the only native Southern critic during the civil rights movement who saw \\"more good than ill in the Southern tradition.\\"  Biography  = Early life and education = Rip Raps Plantation, the McBride ancestral home located in Sumter County, South Carolina. Dabbs was born on May 8, 1896, near Mayesville, South Carolina close to his family's estate, Rip Raps Plantation. His parents were Eugene Whitefield Dabbs and Maude McBride. His mother's family owned Rip Raps Plantation having obtained it several generations earlier. The McBride family were conservative planters, Dabbs called them \\"the inheritors of the culture of the old South.\\" Dabbs' mother died when he was twelve years old and his relationship with his father, a poor overseer who married into money, was not perfect. Dabbs stated that his father's conservative Presbyterian views were a \\"negative force\\" on his life. As an undergraduate Dabbs attended the University of South Carolina, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. He lived in the Old Campus District, University of South Carolina in an area known The Horseshoe. In 1917, he earned a master's degree in psychology from Clark University. The following year he married Jessie Armstrong. Armstrong struggled for years with poor health and became partially paralyzed in the 1920s. She died in 1933. Dabbs later married Edith Mitchell Dabbs in 1935. Mitchell was ten years his junior and had actually been a former student of his. Mitchell would go on to assist Dabbs with editing his work. She would write several books of her own focusing on the South Carolina Sea Islands and Penn Center. During World War I, Dabbs fought in France as a field artillery officer. After returning to the United States, Dabbs attended graduate school at Columbia University. =Career and church life= Dabbs taught at the University of South Carolina for three years before becoming a professor of English at Coker College in 1924. From 1925 to 1937 he served as the head of Coker College's English department. He retired from teaching in 1942. After moving to Rip Raps Plantation in 1937, Dabbs began a significant writing career. He wrote about literature, Christianity, and the Culture of the Southern United States. He was particularly influenced by Henry David Thoreau whom also retired into nature when he wrote some of his best works. His 1958 book, The Southern Heritage was highly regarded for its liberal stances on civil rights issues including desegregation. Dabbs wrote extensively about the death of Armstrong and its effects on his Christian faith in his 1960 book, The Road Home. Dabbs died of a heart attack on May 30, 1970, after he wrote the last line of his book, Haunted by God. The book was poorly received by reviewers for being \\"confusing and unoriginal.\\" It was the only book by Dabbs to be poorly received. Dabbs was considered a leader in the Southern Presbyterian Church (USA). He attended Salem Black River Presbyterian Church for the majority of his life. He also became President of the leading Southern liberal organization, the Southern Regional Council, and later a member of its Executive Committee. The historian Steven P. Miller stated that during Dabbs' tenure as president, Dabbs \\"appealed to a southern sense of decency and community, even while he recognized that those same shibboleths had long concealed failures to address larger injustices.\\" = Legacy = On April 10‚Äì12, 1996, the University of South Carolina held the Dabbs Centennial Symposium which included panelists Jack Bass and Cleveland Sellers. In the 111th South Carolina General Assembly Session, the Assembly passed a resolution to \\"honor the memory of 'James McBride Dabbs.'\\"  Views  = Southern culture and race = Dabbs wrote about Southern culture in his 1964 book, Who Speaks for the South?. In the book, Dabbs argues that the Puritans who settled New England were best defined by their aim to establish a \\"kingdom of god.\\" Dabbs contrasts this with Southerners by stating that the \\"earliest Virginian settler... was seeking not something radically different from Old England but only more of the goods that England offered.\\" Dabbs believed that the New England form of English agricultural towns made Northerners less individualistic and more institutionally minded than the rural Southerners. Dabbs believed that God put African American slaves in the South to test white southerners. The historian, Fred Hobson, states that this idea of the South being a \\"pilot plant\\" for race relations was the central theme of Dabbs' most important works. Dabbs was also criticized for his belief that the South had the capacity to lead the nation in race relations. As well as his blindness to the \\"rage\\" that African Americans held in the 1950s and for his fears of industrialization. =Quotes= :* Where freedom is, God is... the South has stressed order too much and freedom too little. :* As a general thing, the Southerner is burdened by his unhappy past; he doesn't understand it, and he finds it hard to accept. The white Southerner is further confused by the myth of a splendid past, a myth woven during the dark decades from 1865 to 1900, and now, though our minds begin to warn us, still believed in our hearts. Believed and desired. According to this myth, the South was once a complete, perhaps perfect creation, envied by the North, and out of envy attacked, defeated, and crippled. The trouble with this picture is that it is not so. :* \\"Now, the theory that this lower strata can control society and tell the upper class what to do is nonsense to my mind. The lower class will do, by and large, what the people who own the mortgages and the land and the capital will tell them to do. You don't have to tell them outright.\\" :*\\"They really can't be too much against racial inter-mixture, because the history of the South and the presence of mulattoes in the South prove that the Southerner is not deeply opposed to racial inter-mixture. It's a very, very complex question, but the best I can say is that the Southerner is defending mainly status - defending mainly status.\\"  Works  = Books =  = Journal articles = * Religion Without Poetry in The Southern Review. 1936. = Essays = * The Land in The Lasting South References American writers 1896 births 1970 deaths ","title":"James McBride Dabbs"},{"id":"60603509","text":"Henry Camarot is a former member of the Arizona House of Representatives.

The crane, which was being dismantled, fell across the street and its median, crushing six cars near the Fairview Avenue intersection. It also damaged the building's roof and eastern facade. Two of the four victims were ironworkers, while the others, a college student and a former city administrator, were in vehicles on the street. Several strong gusts of wind were reported in the area, including one recorded at a speed of at the time of the collapse, and was briefly theorized as a factor in the collapse. The collapse was captured in a dashcam video that was posted online the day after the accident, showing the perspective from westbound Mercer Street. Seattle has undergone a construction boom since the Great Recession, tallying 60 cranes in early 2019‚Äîthe most in one city in the United States at the time. The last local crane incident to include fatalities occurred in November 2006 during construction of the Expedia Building in Bellevue, which killed one person in a nearby building. As a result, Washington adopted laws to enforce stricter crane safety policies, including enhanced operator certification and training. The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries began an investigation into the incident, with cooperation from developer Vulcan, Inc., the City of Seattle, and general contractor GLY Construction. The collapse's cause was initially unknown, although outside investigators had speculated that the improper removal of pins and bolts during disassembly was a potential cause. Mercer Street remained shut down for the weekend and re-opened on Monday morning, following removal of the crane and debris to a nearby lot.  Primary conclusions  The preliminary findings from the Department of Labor and Industries was released in October and found that the collapse was caused by the premature removal of more than 50 pins between the tower crane sections. State officials indicated they don‚Äôt have a way to compel companies to abandon this practice ‚Äì which can speed up disassembly but jeopardizes a crane‚Äôs stability ‚Äî and they are considering new regulations. The Department of Labor and Industries fined general contractor GLY Construction and Northwest Tower Crane Service, responsible for dismantling the crane $25,200 and $12,000 respectively. Morrow Equipment, which supplied the crane, was cited for a ‚Äúwillful‚Äù serious violation which ‚Äúdirectly contributed to the collapse‚Äù and fined $70,000. The Seattle Police Department is conducting a criminal investigation into the accident. Morrow was cited, because it had approved the removal of pins against recommended practices.

In his first few years as a major league player, Tamiya was utilized as a pitcher and first baseman, but in the prime of his career, he was an outfielder. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002.  Early life  Tamiya was born in Shimodate, Ibaraki and attended Shimodate Shogyo High School. Tamiya also attended Nihon University, where he won a Tokyo Metropolitan University League batting title in 1947, before dropping out.  Professional career  Tamiya first started for the Osaka Tigers of the Japanese Baseball League, as a pitcher and, occasionally, a first baseman. On March 16, 1950, he almost threw the first perfect game in Nippon Professional Baseball history, coming within one out, before Sakae Nakamura got a hit that ended the bid. A shoulder injury in 1952 would see him move to the outfield, where he spent the rest of his career. As a Tiger, Tamiya won the Best Nine Award 3 times, in 1956, 1957, and 1958. He also led the league in slugging percentage and triples in 1957, as well as batting average and triples in 1958. Tamiya would sign with the Daimai Orions in 1959 and immediately tied as league leader in doubles with Kazuhiro Yamauchi. He would win the Best Nine Award two more times, in 1960 and 1961. He retired in 1963. He is one of only six NPB players who have hit 100 homers and pitched a win.  Managerial career  In 1969, Tamiya became a hitting coach for the Chunichi Dragons, but, in the next year, he became the manager of the Toei Flyers, and led for three years, finishing with a record of 155‚Äì209‚Äì21 as the Flyer's skipper. In 1995 and 1996, he was the manager for the Chinese Professional Baseball League team Wei Chuan Dragons and finished with a record of 83‚Äì104‚Äì3.  Later life and death  Tamiya would serve as a council member for his hometown, Shimodate. He died on May 5, 2010, at the age of 82 due to brain hemorrhage.

It is the highest denomination of banknote printed by the Bank of England. It ensures that, for example, if a commercial bank in Scotland or Northern Ireland closes and no one can redeem the value stated on the notes it has issued, holders of such notes know the value of the note is kept as they can exchange them for Bank of England notes. The value of the quantity of the Bank of England notes needed for this hypothetical exchange is pre-donated by commercial Scottish and Northern Irish banks whenever they issue their own notes. The cash donated is then stored in bulk in the form of physical backing assets like Bank of England ¬£100,000,000 notes, which subsequently guarantees the value printed on the Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes to everyday people.  Purpose  The ¬£100,000,000 note (nicknamed \\"Titan\\" simply because of its titanic value) backs the value of common circulating notes (¬£1, ¬£5, ¬£10, ¬£20, ¬£50, and ¬£100 notes) issued by the seven commercial banks in Scotland (Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank) and Northern Ireland (Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, First Trust Bank, and Ulster Bank). The ¬£1,000,000 note plays a similar vital role in the British currency system. Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are often viewed with suspicion by businesses in England and Wales as businesses are not always overly familiar with all the different types of notes that are issued and may not be sure on how to check them for counterfeiting and, therefore, do not like to accept them. There is also the possibility of one of the commercial banks closing; all banknotes issued by a closed commercial bank would be considered worthless. The backing by the ¬£100,000,000 notes and the ¬£1,000,000 notes is intended to maintain public confidence in the value the notes represent. For every pound an authorised Scottish or Northern Irish commercial bank prints and issues in the form of its own notes, it must deposit the equivalent in pound sterling with the Bank of England. If necessary, notes from a struggling Scottish or Northern Irish commercial bank could be replaced with regular Bank of England issued cash. Royal Bank of Scotland ¬£100 note. Its value is backed by assets like the Bank of England ¬£100,000,000 note. The Bank of England prints ¬£100,000,000 notes internally, rather than with its normal commercial printers dotted around the UK, for security reasons. The ¬£100,000,000 notes are then locked away together with other backing assets either within the Bank of England vault, or in other authorised locations, to further ensure their security as physical assets. For even further security, ¬£100,000,000 notes must be signed by the existing Chief Cashier in order to become legal tender and actually be used as a backing asset for commercial banks and their notes in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Originally driven by a bimonthly hackathon, the community has expanded to include different professional and non-information technology background members. Symbolizing the community's efforts to \\"rethink the role of government from zero,\\" and borrowing the parlance of binary from the digital world of 1s and 0s, the O in \\"gov\\" is replaced with a 0 to make \\"g0v\\"; for many government agencies in Taiwan which have URLs ending .gov.tw, replacing .gov with .g0v redirects the user to the so-called shadow government, a \\"forked\\" version of that agency with contributions by civic hackers. Continuing this inspiration from the software development world, the forked content can then be \\"merged\\" back into the government agency's website. g0v is a community that promotes the transparency of government information and is committed to developing information platforms and tools for citizens to participate in society. As of the beginning of 2014, there have been contributors across three continents, and the results have been released in a free software model that embraces knowledge sharing. Origin =The \\"Real Price\\" Incident= Amidst popular unrest regarding speculative housing inflation, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou made housing justice a key component of his 2012 re-election platform. In an attempt to counter speculation and enable fair taxation, the parliament passed a bipartisan bill mandating that all real estate transactions register the actual price. As part of the mandate, the Ministry of the Interior commissioned a website on which people can find transaction records by street address. The site went live on October 16 to a flood of requests and remained only intermittently accessible for most of October. Three days after the launch, a team of four Google.tw engineers incorporated the Ministry's data into their Real-Price Maps website, overlaying aggregated pricing information on Google Maps with a plethora of filtering features. Their remix was well-received, successfully serving hundreds of requests per second from Google App Engine. A week later, Minister without portfolio Simon Chang (a Google alum himself) invited the remixers to a round table. The team responded amiably, offering detailed suggestions about how they would like to collaborate with the government. However, after media coverage pitted the team's shoestring budget of NTD$500 against the official site's ‚Äúmillion-dollar disaster‚Äù, the relationship between the two soon turned sour. The Ministry claimed the crawling activity contributed to their server's downtime, while critics of the engineers' overlay questioned the legality of scraping and remixing government data. The incident came to a head on November 14, when the official site replaced all street addresses with image files, dramatically increasing the burden of crawling. Despite the fact that a civic hacker eventually published parsed data using OCR techniques, the Real-Price Maps site closed shortly thereafter. =\\"Power-Up Plan for the Economy\\"= While the Real Price incident was still unfolding, a new government production took the spotlight: A 40-second video advertisement titled ‚ÄúWhat's the Economy Power-Up Plan?‚Äù Critics found the advertisement, \\"Entirely devoid of information, the clip simply repeated the following monotonous refrain: 'We have a very complex plan. It is too complicated to explain. Never mind the details ‚Äî just follow instructions and go along with it!'\\" The video faced criticism from the public, but went viral; many viewers on YouTube protested the advertisement by clicking ‚Äúreport abuse\\" on the video. The automated system quickly classified the video as spam and banned the government's YouTube account for two days. The video went on-air again on October 19, just before Yahoo! Open Hack Day 2012, an annual 24-hour event in which 64 teams demonstrate innovative creations. Infuriated by the controversial ad, the four members of the ‚ÄúHacker #15‚Äù team made a last-minute pivot from their ‚Äúonline window shopping‚Äù project. Rather than displaying merchandise, they resolved to create a bird's-eye view of how taxes are spent. The resulting Budget Maps project presented each agency's annual spending in the form of geometric shapes of proportional sizes, inviting participants to review and rate each item's usefulness. Calling upon citizens to ‚Äústrike out rip-off spending (e.g. the Power-Up ad)‚Äù, the two-minute demo won NTD$50,000 in Hack Day prizes. In an attempt to bolster interest in this and future projects past the demonstration day, team member CL Kao registered the domain name g0v.tw, dedicated to citizens‚Äô remixes of government websites. The Real-Price Maps thus became accessible at lvr.land.moi.g0v.tw before its shutdown, with only one ASCII character of difference from its official counterpart at lvr.land.moi.gov.tw; meanwhile, the Budget Maps lived on at budget.g0v.tw as the inaugural g0v.tw project. =Hackath0n= Equipped with the new g0v.tw domain, the four hackers agreed to spend the NTD$50k prize on their own hackathon to enlist more projects into the syndicate of civic remixes. Modeled after participant-driven BarCamp events, they named the event 0th Hackathon of Martial Mobilization, or Hackath0n, invoking a rebellious image from Taiwan's 1949-era civil war. Registrants soon exceeded the initial venue's capacity. A lab director at Academia Sinica offered to host the event at the Institute of Information Science. On December 1, civic hackers filled the institute's 80-person auditorium and presented their projects, covering a wide range of government functions, including Congress, Tenders, Geography, Weather, Electricity, Healthcare and many other areas. Discussion continued online at Hackpad and IRC well after the daylong event. In support of the coding efforts, writers and bloggers formed a Facebook group offering on-demand copywriting skills to any project that asked for assistance. Designer Even Wu also initiated an on-demand design group, providing hackers with various visual assets. Dissatisfied with the makeshift logo banner, Wu would continue to work on several iterations of the logotypes, eventually completing a set of Visual Identity guidelines aimed at helping elevate g0v into an easily recognizable brand. Declaration g0v states, \\"[We] have demonstrated a way to combine online and offline activism. Following the model established by the Free Software community over the past two decades, we transformed social media into a platform for social production, with a fully open and decentralized cultural & technological framework.\\" g0v summarizes its collaborative governance philosophy thus: \\"Ask not why nobody is doing this. You are the 'nobody'!\\" Activities and projects g0v community activities are both online and offline, including hackathons, speeches, sharing sessions, teaching, conference, and other activities.

Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band (PPCLI Band) was the former brass and reed regimental band of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry regiment of the Canadian Army. It was maintained by the regiment from 1919-1994 at CFB Calgary.  History  The band was founded in 1919, with its core consisting of musicians from the St. Mary's Boys Brigade Band and the 140th Battalion (St. John's Tigers) Band. When the latter was disbanded in November 1917, the remaining band was merged with the PPCLI to become the PPCLI Band in 1919. It was formed under the direction of Captain Tommy James and was originally stationed at Fort Osborne Barracks in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 1935, Bugle bands were established in the PPCLI's 1st and 2nd battalions.http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520Drum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg;=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS It would be accompanied by a dance Band that would be established two years later in 1937. At the start of the Second World War, members of the PPCLI Band volunteered for active duty, which resulted in its dissolving in 1939. In 1941, the 1st Canadian Division Band was largely made up of former PPCLI Bandsmen. The band was reactivated after the war at Wainwright, Alberta. In 1950 the band was revived in Calgary, where like other military bands (the Band of the Canadian Guards included), members were recruited from the British Army and the Dutch Army. By 1951, the band had numbered 20 members and just two years later in late 1953, it reached its quota of 55 personnel. Sone of thesd members would include notable members of the band, including Brian Albert Gossip and Albert Brown.https://theheritageofmilitarymusic.com/military-musicians On 13 April 1959, the band took part in a NATO military festival in Arnhem in honor of the organization's 10th anniversary.https://books.google.com/books?id=UiAEAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA41&dq;=director+of+the+Princess+Patricia%27s+Canadian+Light+Infantry+Band&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi0rfTn5t7mAhWQJ80KHX7OB7UQ6AEIRDAE#v=onepage&q;=director%20of%20the%20Princess%20Patricia's%20Canadian%20Light%20Infantry%20Band&f;=false The 60s and 70s marked an increase in its activities in Alberta and abroad.

In the early 1980s, the band under the direction of Captain R. Swaneveld, performed during the Changing of the Guard ceremony on Parliament Hill with the Public Duties Detachment (now the Ceremonial Guard). Due to military budget cuts in 1994, the entire band was disbanded and reduced to a Corps of Drums, known today as the PPCLI Drumline.

It was activated in 1945. The 1st Cavalry Division Band performs divisional march \\"The Garryowen\\" during a demonstration cavalry charge by the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment in 2019. History On 3 March 1855, the 1st Cavalry Band was established in the Second Regiment of Cavalry. In March 1861, the band left their post in Fort Mason, which was transferred to the control of the Confederate Army. It would be based in the union states, specifically Pennsylvania, for a good part of the American Civil War. In December 1866, following the conclusion of the Civil War, the regimental band was disbanded at Camp Sedgwick, only to be reconstituted three years later, In 1916 the band participated in the Mexican Expeditionary Force led by General of the Armies John J. Pershing. The 1st Cavalry Division was organized in 1921, after which the associated band was reactivated and assigned to the division. The modern 1st Cavalry Division Band was activated in Luzon, Philippines on June 3, 1945 and initially formed of personnel and equipment transferred from the recently deactivated band of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, as well as personnel from the bands of the 1st and 5th cavalry regiments. During the Korean War, the band advanced into Pyongyang and was the first American military band to perform in the North Korean capital following its fall to United States and South Korean forces in the Battle of Pyongyang. It later suffered a casualty rate exceeding 33-percent during the American withdrawal from Seoul to Taegu after the Chinese-North Korean victory in the Third Battle of Seoul. In 1953 the band was downsized from 96 to 48 troopers and, the following year, assigned secondary duty as a smoke generator unit. Jeanne Pace was appointed bandmaster of the 1st Cavalry Division Band in 1985, becoming the first female bandmaster in the history of the United States Army. According to the U.S. Army, on April 8, 2004 ‚Äì during the United States occupation of Iraq ‚Äì the band survived an ambush and attack with rocket propelled grenades fired by insurgents en route to perform at an officer commissioning ceremony of the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps. Bandsmen involved in the action received the Combat Action Badge. In addition to its service during the Korean War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the band has also been deployed overseas during the Vietnam War and Operation Joint Forge. As of 2012, it was one of three active duty U.S. Army bands posted in Texas. When on parade, the marching band wears the division's trademark black \\"Cav Hat\\".

He spent his last few years travelling widely through Sicily and Yemen. The collections of poems and letters he left behind contain much valuable information for historians. Life Ibn Qalaqis was born in 532 AH (1137 AD) in Alexandria, then part of the Fatimid Caliphate. He moved to Cairo for his education, and studied under Abu Tahir al-Silafi. In 1165/6, he wrote to the Sicilian qƒÅ æid Abu'l-Qasim ibn Hammud ibn al-Hajar, requesting financial assistance for his ·∏•ajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca. He met with difficulties in Egypt and never went, instead accepting Abu'l-Qasim's invitation to come to the island of Sicily, then part of the Norman Kingdom, but retaining a vibrant Arab culture. He arrived in Messina on 11 May 1168 and stayed on the island at least until April 1169.Jeremy Johns (2002). Arabic Administration in Norman Sicily: The Royal Dƒ´wƒÅn. Cambridge University Press, pp. 35 and 233‚Äì41. In Sicily, he stayed in Palermo at the house of his patron Abu'l-Qasim. He arrived in Palermo on 9 June 1168 at the start of Ramadan, and passed the following months visiting the gardens of the Conca d'Oro and the royal palaces. He dedicated qa·π£ƒ´das to Abu'l-Qasim and his three sons, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman. In the summer of 1168, he had a falling out with Abu'l-Qasim‚Äîperhaps over his friendship with al-Sadid Abu'l-Maqarim Hibat Allah ibn al-Husri. While he was preparing to return to Egypt, he received a gift of cheese, butter, oil, tuna, cotton, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, wheat, flour, wine, and other things. Although he does not say from whom the gift came, it was probably from the royal court. Shortly thereafter, he was given an audience with King William I and Queen Margaret. He wrote qa·π£ƒ´das to the monarchs and to Richard the Vizier, a former Muslim who probably arranged the audience. From Palermo, he went to Termini, Cefal√π, Caronia, Patti, Oliveri, and Milazzo before stopping in Syracuse in order to take ship to Egypt. There, however, he wrote a qa·π£ƒ´da to Abu'l-Qasim, who then accepted him back. He returned to Palermo via Lentini, Caltavuturo and Termini. He was back in Palermo by 2 January 1169, when he wrote a qa·π£ƒ´da on the birth of a son to Abu'l-Qasim's brother. He wrote a farewell qa·π£ƒ´da in April 1169 and left Sicily not long after. In late 1169 or early 1170, he travelled to Yemen, then ruled by the Zurayids, who recognized Fatimid authority. He went by way of the Egyptian port of Aydhab. He suffered a shipwreck shortly after leaving Sicily. The purpose of his visit may have been commercial or diplomatic, since he had been urged by the Fatimid poet Umara al-Yamani to see the vizier of Aden, Abu Bakr al-Idi. In Yemen, besides Aden, he also visited Zabid. On his return trip to Aydhab, he suffered another shipwreck, this time in the Dahlak Islands. He was forced to seek the hospitality of the Sultan of Dahlak. During his sojourn in Dahlak, he saw the ruins of the old port of Badi, which he describes in a poem.John Winter Crowfoot (1911), \\"Some Red Sea Ports in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\\", The Geographical Journal, 37(5), pp. 523‚Äì50, esp. 542ff. He eventually got as far as Aydhab, where he died in 567 AH (1172 AD). Writings Ibn Qalaqis's poetry was collected in a dƒ´wƒÅn (collection of short poems), which has been edited and published. His poems praise many important rulers and officials of Egypt, Sicily and Yemen. He praises the last Fatimid caliphs and their viziers, such as Ibn Masal and Shawar.Farhad Daftary, Ismaili Literature: A Bibliography of Sources and Studies (London: I. B. Tauris, 2004), p. 183. A collection of Ibn Qalaqis's letters in the form of an epistolary novel, the Tarassul, also survives. He wrote to friends, patrons and Fatimid officials in both Egypt and Yemen. He also wrote a book, al-Zahr al-bƒÅsim fƒ´ aw·π£ƒÅf Abƒ´'l-QƒÅsim, in honour of Abu'l-Qasim. It is quoted in both prose and verse in the Kharƒ´da of Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani, in the section on the poets of Egypt. The work describes in some detail his travels in Sicily, especially in the muqaddima (prologue). It is also critical to establishing Abu'l-Qasim's family tree. =Editions= *Dƒ´wƒÅn, ed., Khalƒ´l Mu·π≠rƒÅn. Cairo: Ma·π≠ba øat al-JawƒÅ æib, 1905. *Dƒ´wƒÅn, ed., SihƒÅm al-Furay·∏•.

The main drugs involved are heroin, marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine. In the last few decades, various countries in East Africa have become major ports of entry in the international drug trade; illegal substances are transported there from Asia before they are smuggled into Europe and the United States. Little attention is drawn to these activities, partly because the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime lists only a small percentage of seizures of illicit drugs from the region. The United Nations, East African governments, and scholars agree that the low number of recorded seizures are a symptom of the incapability of regional law enforcement, and an inability to evaluate and understand the illegal drug trade. Despite the lack of records of the illegal drug trade in East Africa, there are signs that East Africa is growing as a port of entry for illegal drugs and a channel to transfer drugs into Europe and the United States . For instance, the Journal of International Affairs stated in 2012, \\"The UN office on drugs and crime reported a four-fold increase in cocaine seizures in East Africa in 2009‚Äì10 from 2005.\\"  Background and history  Due to its history and geography, East Africa is an ideal port of entry for the transportation of drugs from Asia. Historical trade routes through the Indian Ocean to Asia and through sub-Saharan Africa have facilitated the flow of legal goods for many years. In the 1970s, however, due to the negative effects of the African debt crisis and associated structural adjustment programs, historically legitimate routes of commerce increasingly became conduits of illicit substances, where illegal substances could flow quickly without much interference. The sociopolitical environment of many countries in East Africa has encouraged the illegal drug trade. Weak law enforcement operations throughout the region are unequipped to prevent smuggling. Corruption has encouraged lucrative illegal operations such as the illicit drug market: officials can be bribed to ignore criminal activities. Poverty is rampant, contributing to the weakness of the state. Illegal drug trafficking in East Africa can be traced back to the mid-1980s, when drug traffickers started using East African countries as their transit sites. The drug trade in East Africa was originally organized and managed by Nigerian crime organizations. In more recent years, criminal organizations from Kenya and Tanzania have also begun to play major roles. Initially, the illegal drug trade through East Africa overwhelmingly traded just two drugs: marijuana and brown sugar heroin. The latter was a type of heroin that was heated into vapor and inhaled, or combined with marijuana into a joint to be smoked. Since brown sugar heroin was administered without a needle, its status as a public health risk was downplayed. Drugs in the early East African drug trade were already being smuggled into Western countries and were present in tourist hubs throughout East Africa. In the late 1990s, brown sugar heroin was replaced in the global drug trade by a new type of heroin. White crest heroin, also known as white powdered heroin, was significantly more potent than other forms of heroin and injectable. Unlike brown sugar heroin, it did not require a complex heating process and was therefore easy to use. Starting in the early 2000s, white crest heroin became very common in East Africa itself for both domestic use and international trafficking, especially in Kenya and Tanzania. The domestic use and smuggling of marijuana and white crest heroin continued into the 2000s. Methamphetamines also became a common illicit drug soon; the first seizure of them was in 2008. There is a lack of data and scholarly research that covers methamphetamines in East Africa, although a growing number of seizures since the first have been recorded. Cocaine is another drug that has become prevalent in the East African drug trade more recently.  Supply  East Africa produces very little to none of the drugs found in the region except marijuana. It is an attractive place for drug smuggling because there is poor border control at ports of entry. The region's two main drug suppliers, Afghanistan and Southeast Asia, are also the two largest suppliers of illicit drugs in the world. In particular, Afghanistan accounts for two-thirds of the production of heroin globally. Heroin from Afghanistan that is headed toward East Africa is transported through Pakistan to be shipped through the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The infamous Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia, covering land in Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos, is another major producer and exporter of marijuana and heroin to East Africa.  Demand  The demand that fuels the East African drug trade is comes from both international and domestic sources. Historically, demand came predominantly from Western countries, but in recent years East African countries have established themselves as consumers of illicit drugs. Middlemen countries like Turkey, which buy East African drugs and resell them to the West, also contribute to high demand. The origin of Western demand comes from centers of tourism that were developed before the 1980s. Coastal resorts in East Africa saw an influx of European, South African, and American tourists, who sparked demand for marijuana and heroin in the region. Beginning in the 1980s, the war on drugs in the United States greatly strengthened East Africa as a piece of the international drug trade because competing drug smuggling operations in Central and South America were closed or significantly impeded.  Ports of entry  Many drugs are sent directly to port cities. From there, they are repackaged and shipped across East Africa through air and sea. Tanzania, in particular, is a major hub; authorities captured major drug hauls there in 2009 and 2011.https://enact- africa.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/2018-07-02-research-paper-heroin- coast.pdf In Kenya, the coastal city Mombasa is a historical hub for drug smuggling. In recent years, it has seen a further rise in activity in the trading of drugs like marijuana, cocaine, and stimulants. Mozambique has recently become a center in the drug smuggling scene as well. In addition to seaports, airports allow for the large-scale transportation of drugs. The Kenyan city Nairobi and the Ethiopian city Addis Ababa have become key points of entry for illegal drugs on the continent that are smuggled through air transport. Because corruption among customs officials lowers barriers that interfere with drug trafficking, airports and seaports are the primary ports of entry for drugs. In Tanzania, infrastructure projects have provided new entry points for drugs and contributed to higher drug usage in cosmopolitan areas.  Types of drugs  A variety of drugs are trafficked through East Africa. The most popular exports are heroin, marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine. = Heroin = Since 2006, heroin usage in Africa has increased faster than on any other continent. As of 2017, Africa is currently experiencing its highest increase in drug use, further increasing its demand for heroin. In terms of consumption, East Africans receive about 9% of the heroin trade globally. = Marijuana = Marijuana was first introduced in East Africa during the Middle Ages by Muslim traders from Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula. Across the continent, marijuana is in the process of becoming legalized for medicinal purposes. Malawi is as a major producer of the drug; its government is currently allowing trial productions of high- quality strains of cannabis. The government of Malawi plans to eventually legalize marijuana as the first government in East Africa to do so. However, illicit cultivation of marijuana is still common throughout East Africa because the growth of these crops allows farmers who are facing financial hardship to pursue new economic opportunities. = Cocaine = Cocaine is another drug emerging on the continent. While most of the cocaine trade comes from North Africa, cocaine is a growing presence in East Africa, although the region is far from conventional cocaine smuggling routes. Starting in 2004, there have been numerous high-profile seizures in East Africa. Cocaine seizures have increased by four times from 2005 to 2009‚Äì10. Much demand for cocaine comes from the emerging middle class. Many East African governments are worried about the prevalence of cocaine. = Methamphetamine = Methamphetamine has taken over the global drug market in recent decades. It can have devastating effects on communities of all economic situations because almost anyone can afford it. While authorities in East Africa have not discovered any operations to manufacture methamphetamine, they have reported minor confiscations, wherein the methamphetamine is usually in transit to Asia.  Effects  Scholarly research regarding the effects of the drug trade on the countries and populations of East Africa is uncommon but has determined that the impacts of the East African drug trade are widespread. African police agencies have few resources and little capacity to record crime statistics; when they do, they often do not differentiate between conventional and transnational criminal activity. Much of the scholarship that discusses the effects of the East African drug trade is derived from a small amount of qualitative data, and case studies that lack quantitative data to substantiate their claims. = Corruption = The illegal drug trade is an extremely lucrative venture that encourages corruption in government. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the global heroin market produced in revenue in 2009. Corruption thrives in impoverished environments with weak states and incapable law enforcement. The International Journal of Drug Policy finds \\"extensive evidence of 'drug-corruption' among government officials and employees from numerous countries\\" throughout Africa, including many countries in East Africa. Corruption relating to drugs impacts East Africa's development. It allows for the increased flow of drugs throughout East Africa and handicaps counter-narcotic efforts, ultimately strengthening the organizational structures of drug trafficking. Research suggests that corruption caused by the drug trade damages the state process of development. Scholars argue in the International Journal of Drug Policy that \\"the drug trade impedes economic growth because this illegal income is rarely transformed into productive capital investments which are necessary for long- term and sustained economic expansion.\\" Corruption undermines the state's capacity to develop robust institutions that are essential for establishing the rule of law and strong economies. Moreover, the Journal of International Affairs reports that Kenya \\"is well on its way to being captured ... by organized crime groups\\". = Terrorism = Profits from the illegal drug trade in East Africa are being used to finance terrorist organizations and other insurgent movements; however, the degree to which said groups are funded by the drug trade is unknown. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration claims that a large portion of the organizations that are labeled as foreign terrorist organizations have direct ties to the illicit drug trade. The international nature of the drug trade means that those arrested in East Africa can be prosecuted by the US and other Western countries if a link is found with terrorist groups, even if the arrested people are not transporting the drugs to Western countries. Additionally, many groups incriminated in the drug smuggling industry have been tied to terrorist groups in East Africa, most notably Al-Shabaab. Other groups related to Al-Shabaab are prominent, such as the Muslim Youth Center of Kenya, which recruits young foreigners to fight for Al-Shabaab. Such terrorist groups have assisted in the smuggling of drugs as well as personnel both into East Africa and between African countries. The drugs fund these terrorist groups and allow them to continue operations. In addition to drugs, these groups smuggle black market sugar and resources such as charcoal. = Youth = Africa is the most youthful continent in the world. While most of the world is experiencing an aging population, sixty percent of Africans are under the age of 25. Demand for drugs from youth has caused a proliferation of access to illegal drugs in East Africa. The International Journal of Drug Policy says that \\"according to World Bank data, illicit drug users in developing countries 'typically fall within the age group of 15‚Äì44, although most are in their mid-twenties.'\\" Case studies have produced evidence to reaffirm the concern that links the proliferation of illegal drugs and the large youthful population. Also, the same journal describes that researchers working in the coastal and interior regions of Tanzania have found that \\"excluding cannabis, heroin was the most commonly used drug, and was concentrated among young men of working age.\\" The use of drugs in youthful populations may lead to a decrease in productivity, and public health crises. = HIV = Injecting drugs with needles is credited with the rise of HIV in East African countries. In particular, in the countries of Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, and Kenya, those who partake in drugs are more likely to have HIV. Drug users account for 2% of new HIV infections as of 2014. Consumers of drugs are more likely to contract HIV before the age of 25 compared to the general population, and statistics point toward a higher rate of HIV infections compared to the general population. The HIV epidemic has struck some countries harder than others; Kenya has been hit the hardest. Drug use among sex workers is a major cause of the issue. Sex workers inject drugs before or after intercourse. Due to lack of funds, they are forced to use contaminated needles. Combined with a lack of knowledge about the disease itself, contamination through injection has led to a spike in HIV rates among sex workers, which in turn has led to a proliferation of the disease across the country. Heroin is a particularly notable cause of HIV transmission through injection. In the 21st century, injection became the most popular method of inserting heroin into the body. The International Journal of Drug Policy states that \\"drug use has been a major factor in the spread of HIV in developing countries, often as a result of syringe sharing and re-use.\\" Few people are aware of the risks involved with the use and reuse of syringes. In addition, in the case of Kenya, 20% of the general population is estimated to be HIV-positive. The combination of the prevalence of HIV, the injection of drugs, and the lack of healthcare and awareness that exists around these dangerous practices suggest a hazardous environment that could contribute to a public health crisis. Researchers in Tanzania and Kenya found that the HIV rate among a sample of heroin users was more than 50%, which is well over the 13% average. Currently, many countries in Africa, such as Tanzania and Mauritius, are developing methadone programs to stem the tide of drug injections, which are a major cause of HIV. These programs forgo abstinence by offering medicine to alleviate the symptoms of withdrawal. Thousands are now enrolling in these programs in order to overcome addiction, and avoid the threat of HIV infection due to injection by contaminated needles.

Her photographic works are held in the collection of the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.  Early life  Bryony Dalefield was born in 1951 in Palmerston North, New Zealand, and grew up on a farm in the Manawatu region. In 1976, Dalefield travelled to the United Kingdom to work. During the 1990s Dalefield lived and worked in the village of Wye on the English-Welsh border.  Education  Dalefield studied photography at the Elam School of Fine Arts in Auckland.  Career  After graduating from Elam, Dalefield worked as a photographer in New Zealand. Her photographs were featured in New Art: Some Recent New Zealand Sculpture and Post-Object Art, edited by Jim Allen and Wystan Curnow in 1976. Dalefield began making quilt works around 1979 after seeing an exhibition in the UK where quilting was presented as an artistic medium. Her quilt works have included motifs such as eyes, hands, scissors and trees, along with MƒÅori-inspired designs. Regarding works presented in her solo exhibition Provided with Eyes, Dalefield said that her quilting > has taken me to various countries and through stages in my life. I think > they reflect that, to me they a story about a journey. [...] What I like is > the size. Quilting is done on a larger scale and designed to be wrapped > around the body. All my work is larger than me. Dalefield works mainly with tartans (a nod to her Scottish ancestry), chintz, calico and glazed cotton, fabrics that are all prone to fading. She describes herself as a quilter \\"greedy for pattern\\". Notable exhibitions: * No Man's Land: Extending the Boundaries of Women and Art in Aotearoa at Dowse Art Museum, Lower Hutt, 1993. This exhibition, curated by Laurence Hall, celebrated the centennial of Women's suffrage in New Zealand, and featured work from 47 artists known for their innovations in craft and materials. Dalefield presented a work titled Do we stand on their shoulders or do they ride on ours? * Provided with Eyes at Dowse Art Museum, Lower Hutt, 1994. For this exhibition, Dalefield brought to New Zealand a collection of 33 quilts from an exhibition that had first shown at the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery in Swansea, Wales. The exhibition was then shown at other galleries around New Zealand (including Auckland Museum) before heading back to the UK for a national tour. Dalefield wrote a text to accompany the exhibition, also titled Provided with Eyes. * Contact at Michael Lett Gallery, 2013. This exhibition presented fifty black and white photographs by Dalefield, documenting the 1974 performance of Jim Allen's work Contact at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki. * Cusp at Ruthin Craft Centre, Denbighshire, 2017.

His notname comes from a crucifix on wood which is displayed at the Museo del Bigallo in Florence.  Life and work  His earliest established work is a dossal with four scenes, featuring Saint Zenobius, preserved at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo. It was displayed at the Saint's actual tomb until 1439 and was created sometime during the term of Archbishop (1205-1230) when the altar was re-consecrated.Angelo Tartuferi, Il Maestro del Bigallo e la pittura della prima met√† del Duecento agli Uffizi, Firenze, Edizioni Polistampa, 2007. A slightly earlier \\"Madonna and Child\\" at Fiesole Cathedral has also been tentatively identified as his. The crucifix at the Museo del Bigallo likely dates from the first half of the 1230s. The \\"Madonna and Child Enthroned with Two Saints\\" from the latter half of that decade has also been identified as his, although the poor state of preservation makes this determination difficult.

After completing her bachelors in visual art, Graham trained as a teacher and worked at secondary schools in Auckland, including MƒÅori boarding school St Stephens, while continuing to make art.  Career  Graham's art practice draws on her MƒÅori heritage to explore critical issues that affect New Zealand society such as racism, cultural stereotyping and land rights, particularly the controversial foreshore and seabed legislation. Frequently her works incorporate Treaty of Waitangi and MƒÅori motifs. Graham cites her grandmother, Rose Isobel Simons, as a key creative influence on her life. Graham believes that the foreshore and seabed controversy was the issue that gave her the political drive as an artist. Solo exhibitions: * Trouble in Paradise at Oedipus Rex Gallery, Auckland, 2004. Graham presented both text and pictorial devices to address the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy. Her imagery included traditional MƒÅori motifs and European numerals. * Nga Karetao at Oedipus Rex Gallery, Auckland, 2005.

This group show presented works from five MƒÅori women artists offering interpretations on the theme 'permissions.' The other artists were Lonnie Hutchinson, Claudine Muru, Donna Tupaea and Kate Pie. Graham's works in this show explore permissions as a birthright afforded MƒÅori as tangata whenua, with reference to the Crown's actions regarding the foreshore and seabed legislation. She incorporates Treaty of Waitangi text and MƒÅori narratives to condemn the legislation and how it impinges on birthrights for MƒÅori. * Workshop Style at Taketake Gallery, Whakatane, 2004. This exhibition presented a selection of works by young MƒÅori artists in a variety of mediums.

A tenor, he is known particularly as a soloist in the first performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah. Life He was born in Thatcham in Berkshire, on 20 March 1820, son of Angel Lockey of Oxford. He was a choirboy at Magdalen College, Oxford from 1828 to 1836, and afterwards studied singing with Edward Harris at Bath; in 1842 he was a pupil of Sir George Smart. Lockey sang in the choirs of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and Eton College Chapel. In 1843 he became a vicar-choral of St Paul's Cathedral. His first public appearance in oratorio was in October 1842, when he sang in Rossini's Stabat Mater for the Melophonic Society. In 1848 he was appointed a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. He performed at the Concerts of Antient Music in 1846; he also sang at concerts of the Three Choirs Festival and the Sacred Harmonic Society. In 1846 Lockey was engaged for the Birmingham Festival: in the first performance, on 26 August, of Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah he sang \\"Then shall the righteous\\". Mendelssohn, on hearing him rehearse the song, asked him also to sing \\"If with all your hearts\\", which had been assigned to another singer. \\"A young English tenor,\\" the composer wrote in a letter, \\"sang the last air so very beautifully that I was obliged to collect myself to prevent my being overcome, and to enable me to beat time steadily.\\" On 24 May 1853 he married Martha Williams, a contralto singer (died 1897). They had one son, John. Lockey retired from public life about 1862, on account of a throat disorder, and entered into business at Gravesend and Dover. He nominally held his position at St Paul's until his death, but for forty-three years Fred Walker, Joseph Barnby, and Edward Lloyd were his deputies. He died on 3 December 1901 in Hastings.

Kasavuli was the first female news anchor in the country and has previously worked in other leading television stations including Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) and Kenya Television Network (KTN). Career Kasavuli started her career as a radio continuity announcer in 1980 at the Voice of Kenya, which was renamed to KBC in later years. Her uncle, who had listened to her reading the Bible and praying for dinner, advised her to apply for the job. She was barely 18 years at the time. Kasavuli would later transition to television at the company in 1985. Kasavuli had no prior professional training and two years into her job, she went to the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication. In March 1990, Catherine became part of the founding team of KTN as the first privately owned television station in the country. She became the station's first anchor to go on live broadcast, a shift from the previous pre-recorded format. Other than being a TV presenter, Kasavuli would voice commercials to supplement her earnings. After being at KTN for 17 years, Kasavuli left the station in 2007 to join Citizen TV, owned by Royal Media Services. She was part of the mass exodus that saw a number of high-profile news anchors such as Swaleh Mdoe and Louie Otieno leave the Standard Group owned TV Station for Citizen TV. She would later hold the position of corporate affairs manager at Royal Media Services, the parent company of Citizen TV. In 2015, Kasavuli retired from the limelight to work behind the screens. Personal life Kasavuli has one son, Martin, who was born in 1981. Catherine has reportedly stated that she had to leave him home to attend to her demanding career and regrets the early moments of his childhood.
