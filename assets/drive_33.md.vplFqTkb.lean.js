Its type species, P. bullocki was described by the paleontologist Richard Owen (noted for coining the word Dinosauria) in 1853. Since then, and throughout the late 19th century, many fossil turtles were incorrectly assigned to this genus. Taxonomy Pleurosternon fossils were first described by Richard Owen in 1841 under the living genus Platemys. It was not until 1853 however, that it was published under the name Pleurosternon in a paper Owen presented to the Palaeontographical Society. = Phylogeny = Cladogram after Tyler R. Lyson and Walter G. Joyce (2009). Description Carapace fossil of P. bullocki, side view. Pleurosternon has a very depressed carapace, much flatter than similar genera, such as the North American Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous Glyptops. Adults show little or none of the nuchal emargination that is more visible in juveniles. The Xiphiplastras also have a large, V-shaped notch near the back of the bone. Together with Platychelys, it is one of the few turtle genera to exhibit the characteristics of both modern turtle suborders, the Cryptodira and the Pleurodira. Distribution and habitat In Europe, most species of Pleurosternon are best known from southeast England's Purbeck Group and Portland stone, some specimens were even recovered in the Purbeck's type locality. Several areas within the formation became noted by some for producing pleurosternon fossils. Among them were Swanage, Durlston Bay, Langton Matravers, and Herston. The genus has also been found in several rock formations from the upper Jurassic in both France and Spain, and from the Cretaceous Wealden group of both England and northern Germany. The Purbeck formation, at the time was a coastal region with a complex system of shallow lagoons that slowly lost their salinity over time. Similarly, the younger Wealden group was also coastal plain dominated by lagoons but with the addition of braided streams. The Portland stone, however is a maritime deposit of similar age near the Purbeck, most bones found there are interpreted as having washed out to sea from the Wealden or the Purbeck. Because of this, Pleurosternon has been described as a \\"shore-turtle\\".

People of Mullakkadu  The workers in Mullakkadu leave their homes early in the morning to work in the plantations or towns nearby. Some have their own plantations, and some make certain articles in their homes to sell them in the towns. A few of the villagers, including women, go out to catch fish in the streams and rivers found in the village. In the afternoon, most of them are at home. Some of them take a nap (Kutti thookam) after lunch, do some work in their small gardens or pay some visits to the small shops in the village. In various parts of the village, children may be found playing the popular games of the village. In Mullakkadu (Not only in Mullakkadu, almost in all villages) there is a headman (Panchayathu Thalaivar) whose duty is to settle quarrels among the villagers and maintain peace in the village. Whenever there is a dispute, the villagers go to the headman who is held in such esteem that his words have the force of law. In this way, the villagers have developed their own laws, and the crimes of cities are almost unknown to the people of the village. During a festival, the whole Mullakkadu is alive with activities. This is the time for the men, women, and children of the village to wear their best clothes and the village is full of colour. The majority of the people in Mullakkadu live on agriculture. They used to harvest paddies, bananas, black grams, etc. Harvest time is certainly the busiest and the merriest time of the year. During the harvest, the villagers often get up very early in the morning. They go to their rice-fields to harvest the bumper crop ‚Äì the fruit of many months of hard work.

It is endemic to Texas, where it is known from about ten populations in the deep sands alongside the Colorado River.The Nature Conservancy Much of its habitat has been lost, which is the reason it was federally listed as an endangered species in 1981.USFWS. Determination of Callirhoe scabriuscula to be an endangered species. Federal Register January 13, 1981.  Description  This is a perennial herb with an erect stem that may exceed one meter in height. It produces showy cup-shaped flowers in shades of magenta to wine red with a darker red spot at the base of each petal. Flowering occurs for a short period of time during May or June. The flower opens just before dawn and closes at sunset every day for 6 to 8 days. As soon as the flower is pollinated, it closes within 90 minutes and begins to wither. The flower is a favorite stop for local bees, the main pollinators.  Distribution and habitat  This plant is present in three Texas counties along the Colorado River in an ecoregion known as the Rolling Plains.Texas Parks & Wildlife It only grows in deep spits of windblown, alluvial sand. This habitat has been extensively degraded and destroyed by a number of processes and human activities, including agriculture, sand mining, development, road construction, and application of herbicides and insecticides. The flowers are also very attractive and may be picked by admirers and collectors. Extreme drought leads to reduced moisture levels which stunts the plants, sometimes preventing any above-ground growth, flowering, or fruiting.Tolme, P.

Family  He was born in Gloucestershire, the eldest son of John Freeman and his wife Anne Croft. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford and called to the Bar in 1674. He married firstly Elizabeth, one of the many daughters of the leading politician and barrister Sir Anthony Keck, and his wife Mary Thorne. Elizabeth died in childbirth with her only daughter Mary in 1699. He married secondly Collin's Peerage of England London 1812 Vol. IX p.184 in 1702 Anne Marshal of Durham, who outlived him by many years. His first marriage was an advantageous one, since his father-in-law Sir Anthony Keck was a very rich man. However Freeman's children may have found the Keck inheritance something of a mixed blessing, as it led after his death to much acrimony and years of litigation between the heirs. By his first marriage he had one daughter, Mary, who married Walter Edwards of Ham, Surrey, and had issue; by his second marriage he had one son, Richard junior, and one daughter, Anne. All three of his children were still living in 1727, when the long and bitter lawsuit over their father's estate was finally concluded by a verdict that any claim that Mary had on the estate must be set off against the sum of ¬£5000 which her father had settled on her.Edwards v Freeman (1727), reported in Reports of cases argued and determined in the Court of Chancery Vol. 3 Mary died in 1736; Anne had died unmarried some years earlier. Richard junior died in 1741, without issue.Collins Peerage p.184  Career  After 30 years practice at the English Bar Freeman finally secured judicial office through his friendship with John Somers, the former Lord Chancellor, who had a high opinion of his abilities. In 1706 he became Lord Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and within a year was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, in which capacity he also acted as Speaker of the Irish House of Lords. He is listed as one of the trustees of the King's Inns in 1706.Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Dublin Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 In 1710 Freeman was suddenly afflicted with what was described as \\"a disorder of the brain\\" which was said to have deprived him entirely of his reason. Certainly he was unable to continue in office, and he died on 20 November 1710, shortly after resigning from the Chancellorship. He died intestate, and the dispute over the inheritance to his estate, in particular the sum of ¬£5000 which he had settled on his elder daughter Mary Edwards, led to litigation between his widow and the children of his two marriages, which went on until 1727.Edwards v Freeman  Character  According to Elrington Ball,Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Freeman was a fine lawyer who gained general respect in Ireland, being noted for good humour and charity as well as legal ability.

Wikman in 1972 as a program of the choir of the Church of St. Paul and the Redeemer in Hyde Park. It was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1975, and received critical acclaim early in its history. Conductor Jane Glover was named Music Director in September 2002. Nicholas Kraemer is the ensemble's Principal Guest Conductor. William Jon Gray was named chorus director in 2010. Declan McGovern has been the organization's executive director since 2017. Works performed have included Claudio Monteverdi‚Äôs operas and 1610 Vespers, Georg Philipp Telemann‚Äôs Day of Judgment, Mozart‚Äôs Idomeneo, numerous Handel operas and oratorios, and the major choral works of J. S. Bach. In recent seasons, Music of the Baroque has given modern premieres of several works by Telemann, including the cantatas, \\"Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft,\\" \\"Dich r√ºhmen die Welten,\\" and \\"Siehe, das ist Gottes Lamm.\\" The group has also performed on radio broadcasts and recordings on 98.7 WFMT Radio. They received an Emmy Award nomination for their DVD, \\"A Renaissance Christmas\\". The ensemble announced the details of their 50th anniversary season in February 2020. Opening in September, programs will include Haydn's Creation, the group's first-ever performance of all six Brandenburg Concertos in the same evening, the group's first performances in a decade of Handel's Messiah at Thanksgiving, and Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero's debut with the group in performances of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21.

Joining Music of the Baroque as guest conductor for the first time is renowned early music specialist John Butt, founder and director of Scotland‚Äôs Dunedin Consort. Butt will lead the orchestra in a program featuring concertos by Vivaldi and others. The cornerstone of the 50th anniversary celebration will be the ensemble's first performances in over a decade of Bach‚Äôs monumental Passion According to St. Matthew, featuring critically acclaimed British tenor James Gilchrist singing the role of the Evangelist. The performances will also serve as the second installment of the group's four-recording Bach project. The group will also present its second Baroque in the Park, an open-air performance on the stage of the Pritzker Pavilion featuring highlights of the 50th season plus other Baroque works. Recordings Music of the Baroque's available recordings include \\"Glover Conducts Mozart,\\" featuring Symphonies 40 and 41; \\"Mother & Child,\\" recorded live during the ensemble's 2013 holiday concerts and conducted by Paul Agnew; \\"On This Night,\\" recorded live during the ensemble's 2017 holiday concerts and conducted by William Jon Gray; and Telemann's Day of Judgement. The ensemble plans to release a recording of Bach's Mass in B Minor, recorded live in September 2019 and conducted by Music Director Jane Glover, in the fall of 2020.

She spent over 30 years building schools for both girls and boys, ministering to their families and writing books based on her experiences. Whately was the first to build educational facilities for the lower classes in Cairo, especially Muslim women, and started schooling for all, rather than only for those who could pay for it. Family Mary Louisa Whately was born on August 31, 1824 at Halesworth in Suffolk, England, as the third child (second daughter) born to Richard Whately and Elizabeth Pope. Her father was a rector in Suffolk when Mary Louisa Whately was born, but appointed Principal of Alban Hall in Oxford in 1827, and then Archbishop of Dublin in 1831, whereupon the family moved to Ireland, where Mary Louisa Whately remained until she went to Egypt. Mary never married and had no children, but travelled often to visit her family in Dublin. Her mother and youngest sister died in the winter of 1860. Her father died in 1863. Education Mary Louisa Whately had little formal education. She was taught by her well-educated parents in reading, writing and school subjects such as history, arithmetic and science. They also trained her in religious studies. She was a quick and diligent in her studies. When the family moved to Dublin, Archbishop Whately opened a school, at which Mary Louisa Whately and her siblings taught the city children. This training through teaching was instrumental in Mary Louisa Whately's later career. She was also educated in Italian and French and gained experience working with various nationalities during the Irish famine. When Mary Louisa Whately moved to Cairo, she hired a native missionary, Mansoor Shakoor, to teach her Arabic. Missionary gains Mary Louisa Whately first moved to Cairo, Egypt, in 1860 to recover from health problems. On arriving she found a house in the lower-class area of Cairo and found there were no schools there available for young girls. She bought a second house and hired as a helper a poor Syrian girl who lived in the rooms below. This was the first school in Egypt open to Muslim girls. In 1861, Whately moved to Pau, France to rest and continue to recover. That winter she cared for the son of a Scottish minister who was terminally ill. Whately's work with him was instrumental in her decision to open a medical mission in 1879. In the winter of 1862 Whately returned to Cairo and re-opened the school she had started, and shortly afterwards opened one for Muslim boys. Mansoor Shakoor and his two brothers helped her teach at both schools.M. L. Whately, A Memoir of Mansoor Shakoor, of Lebanon, 1873. This allowed Whately to traverse the Nile and visit other towns and villages. She read to the women and children there and provided what education and medicine she could. In 1869 the Prince of Wales visited Whately in Cairo, which led to a grant of land to her just outside the city walls for the purpose of building a school. As this school grew, Whately decided to add a medical facility for care and training. Writings Mary Louisa Whately wrote 12 books on her missionary work and on life in Egypt, designed to educate people in Britain about the daily life in Egypt, especially the poor. Her books Child-Life in Egypt, Ragged Life in Egypt, Scenes from Life in Cairo and Stories of Peasant Life on the Nile were some of the first of their kind for Egypt. They describe hardship and tasks that the poor and their children have in life simply to survive. Her collected works, Letters From Egypt to Plain Folks at Home, explained what Whately was accomplishing in Egypt, along with her daily life and that of the people she lived with. Whately wrote other books on certain experiences she had and people she had met. A Memoir of Mansoor Shaknoor, The Prism... and others covered people who had a significant impact on her life and ministry. Selected works *Whately, M. L. A Memoir of Mansoor Shakoor, of Lebanon.

The hill contains deposits of fuller's earth and these have been analysed for their content of fossil shellfish.

The scarps which had been seen from the road and were thought to provide evidence of a man-made structure were found to be natural geological formations. There was also no sign of the cairn or pile of stones which had been described in the 18th century, but in 1975, Ralph Whitlock wrote of hilltop earthworks that were occupied in Iron Age times.

Statistical tests (such as hypothesis testing) generally require knowledge of the probability distribution of the test statistic. This is often a problem for likelihood ratios, where the probability distribution can be very difficult to determine. A convenient result by Samuel S. Wilks says that as the sample size approaches \\\\infty, the distribution of the test statistic -2 \\\\log(\\\\Lambda) asymptotically approaches the chi-squared (\\\\chi^2) distribution under the null hypothesis H_0. Here, \\\\Lambda denotes the likelihood ratio, and the \\\\chi^2 distribution has degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of \\\\Theta and \\\\Theta_0, where \\\\Theta is the full parameter space and \\\\Theta_0 is the subset of the parameter space associated with H_0. This result means that for large samples and a great variety of hypotheses, a practitioner can compute the likelihood ratio \\\\Lambda for the data and compare -2\\\\log(\\\\Lambda) to the \\\\chi^2 value corresponding to a desired statistical significance as an approximate statistical test. The theorem no longer applies when any one of the estimated parameters is at its upper or lower limit: Wilks‚Äô theorem assumes that the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô but unknown values of the estimated parameters lie within the interior of the supported parameter space. The likelihood maximum may no longer have the assumed ellipsoidal shape if the maximum value for the population likelihood function occurs at some boundary-value of one of the parameters, i.e. on an edge of the parameter space. In that event, the likelihood test will still be valid and optimal as guaranteed by the Neyman-Pearson lemma, but the significance (the -value) can not be reliably estimated using the chi- squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom prescribed by Wilks. Use Each of the two competing models, the null model and the alternative model, is separately fitted to the data and the log-likelihood recorded. The test statistic (often denoted by ) is twice the log of the likelihoods ratio, i.e., it is twice the difference in the log-likelihoods: : \\\\begin{align} D & = -2\\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\text{likelihood for null model}}{\\\\text{likelihood for alternative model}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & = 2\\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\text{likelihood for alternative model}}{\\\\text{likelihood for null model}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] &= 2 \\\\times [ \\\\ln(\\\\text{likelihood for alternative model}) - \\\\ln(\\\\text{likelihood for null model}) ] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\end{align} The model with more parameters (here alternative) will always fit at least as well ‚Äî i.e., have the same or greater log-likelihood ‚Äî than the model with fewer parameters (here null). Whether the fit is significantly better and should thus be preferred is determined by deriving how likely (-value) it is to observe such a difference by chance alone, if the model with less parameters were true. Where the null hypothesis represents a special case of the alternative hypothesis, the probability distribution of the test statistic is approximately a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\\\,df_\\\\text{alt} - df_\\\\text{null}\\\\,, respectively the number of free parameters of models alternative and null. For example: If the null model has 1 parameter and a log-likelihood of ‚àí8024 and the alternative model has 3 parameters and a log-likelihood of ‚àí8012, then the probability of this difference is that of chi-squared value of 2 \\\\times (-8012 - (-8024)) = 24 with 3 - 1 = 2 degrees of freedom, and is equal to 6 \\\\times 10^{-6}. Certain assumptions must be met for the statistic to follow a chi-squared distribution, but empirical -values may also be computed if those conditions are not met. Examples =Coin tossing= An example of Pearson's test is a comparison of two coins to determine whether they have the same probability of coming up heads. The observations can be put into a contingency table with rows corresponding to the coin and columns corresponding to heads or tails. The elements of the contingency table will be the number of times each coin came up heads or tails. The contents of this table are our observations . : \\\\begin{array}{ccc} X & \\\\text{Heads} & \\\\text{Tails} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\text{Coin 1} & k_\\\\mathrm{1H} & k_\\\\mathrm{1T} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{Coin 2} & k_\\\\mathrm{2H} & k_\\\\mathrm{2T} \\\\end{array} Here consists of the possible combinations of values of the parameters p_\\\\mathrm{1H}, p_\\\\mathrm{1T}, p_\\\\mathrm{2H}, and p_\\\\mathrm{2T}, which are the probability that coins 1 and 2 come up heads or tails. In what follows, i = 1, 2 and j = \\\\mathrm{H,T}. The hypothesis space is constrained by the usual constraints on a probability distribution, 0 \\\\le p_{ij} \\\\le 1, and p_{i \\\\mathrm H} + p_{i \\\\mathrm T} = 1 . The space of the null hypothesis H_0 is the subspace where p_{1j} = p_{2j}. Writing n_{ij} for the best estimates of p_{ij} under the hypothesis , the maximum likelihood estimate is given by :n_{ij} = \\\\frac{k_{ij}}{k_{i\\\\mathrm H}+k_{i\\\\mathrm T}}\\\\,. Similarly, the maximum likelihood estimates of p_{ij} under the null hypothesis H_0 are given by :m_{ij} = \\\\frac{k_{1j}+k_{2j}}{k_\\\\mathrm{1H}+k_\\\\mathrm{2H}+k_\\\\mathrm{1T}+k_\\\\mathrm{2T}}\\\\,, which does not depend on the coin . The hypothesis and null hypothesis can be rewritten slightly so that they satisfy the constraints for the logarithm of the likelihood ratio to have the desired nice distribution. Since the constraint causes the two-dimensional to be reduced to the one-dimensional H_0, the asymptotic distribution for the test will be \\\\chi^2(1), the \\\\chi^2 distribution with one degree of freedom. For the general contingency table, we can write the log-likelihood ratio statistic as :-2 \\\\log \\\\Lambda = 2\\\\sum_{i, j} k_{ij} \\\\log \\\\frac{n_{ij}}{m_{ij}}\\\\,. Invalid for random or mixed effects models Wilks‚Äô theorem assumes that the true but unknown values of the estimated parameters are in the interior of the parameter space. This is commonly violated in random or mixed effects models, for example, when one of the variance components is negligible relative to the others. In some such cases, one variance component can be effectively zero, relative to the others, or in other cases the models can be improperly nested. To be clear: These limitations on Wilks‚Äô theorem do not negate any power properties of a particular likelihood ratio test. The only issue is that a \\\\chi^2 distribution is sometimes a poor choice for estimating the statistical significance of the result. =Bad examples= Pinheiro and Bates (2000) showed that the true distribution of this likelihood ratio chi-square statistic could be substantially different from the na√Øve \\\\chi^2 ‚Äì often dramatically so. The na√Øve assumptions could give significance probabilities (-values) that are, on average, far too large in some cases and far too small in others. In general, to test random effects, they recommend using Restricted maximum likelihood (REML). For fixed-effects testing, they say, ‚Äúa likelihood ratio test for REML fits is not feasible‚Äù, because changing the fixed effects specification changes the meaning of the mixed effects, and the restricted model is therefore not nested within the larger model. As a demonstration, they set either one or two random effects variances to zero in simulated tests. In those particular examples, the simulated -values with restrictions most closely matched a 50‚Äì50 mixture of \\\\chi^2(k) and \\\\chi^2(k-1). (With , \\\\chi^2(0) is 0 with probability 1\\\\. This means that a good approximation was \\\\,0.5\\\\,\\\\chi^2(1)\\\\,.) Pinheiro and Bates also simulated tests of different fixed effects. In one test of a factor with 4 levels (degrees of freedom = 3), they found that a 50‚Äì50 mixture of \\\\chi^2(3) and \\\\chi^2(4) was a good match for actual -values obtained by simulation ‚Äì and the error in using the na√Øve \\\\chi^2(3) ‚Äúmay not be too alarming.‚Äù However, in another test of a factor with 15 levels, they found a reasonable match to \\\\chi^2(18) ‚Äì 4 more degrees of freedom than the 14 that one would get from a na√Øve (inappropriate) application of Wilks‚Äô theorem, and the simulated -value was several times the na√Øve \\\\chi^2(14). They conclude that for testing fixed effects, ‚Äúit's wise to use simulation.‚Äù See also *Bayes factor *Model selection *Sup-LR test Notes References Other sources  * External links * Category:Statistical ratios Category:Statistical tests ","title":"Wilks' theorem"},{"id":"30612751","text":"Vinyl Cafe Stories (1998) is a two-CD album by Stuart McLean released in 1998 by Vinyl Cafe Productions.

Media appearances and interviews In October 2009, Matlack started the Good Men Book tour at Sing Sing prison. According to Matlack, \\"My book is about manhood and redemption. I have in my mind the image of Johnny Cash going into Fulsom Prison. Like his music, my book is about manhood, raw and unvarnished. So I need to find guys who understand what that is about. It's also about the possibility of redemption, about making mistakes, and about picking yourself up. I have no idea what I am going to say to these guys but I am going to try.\\" In December 2009, Matlack appeared on the Tyra Banks Show where he donated, on behalf of the Good Men Foundation, $5,000 to help cover Christmas expenses for a family who had just lost their husband and father. Matlack has interviewed David Kohan, creator of Will & Grace and artist Shep Fairey. He has also been interviewed by his own foundation where he discusses his reason for starting the Good Men Foundation.

In 1909 he became a theology professor and librarian at the Catholic Institute of Toulouse, where he taught for most of his life. He collaborated with Jesuit Fr. Joseph de Guibert in editing Revue d'asc√©tique et mystique after 1924 and became its editor from 1928 until his death. He also collaborated in producing the Dictionary of Ascetic and Mystical Spirituality in 1928 and edited the Catholic Institute review, Bulletin of Ecclesiastical Literature. His research focused on patristics: he produced a doctoral dissertation (1905) on the schism of Antioch and on a sermon of Eustathius of Antioch. He also wrote on Saint Athanasius (1908) and produced indices of the Greek Patrologia Graeca of Jacques Paul Migne (1912) and of Christian doctrine (Thesaurus doctrinae catholicae ex documentas Magisterii ecclesiastici, 1920) which is similar to that of Denzinger. He published on the life and work of Saint Jerome, and questioned Jerome's authorship of some parts of the New Testament Vulgate.F.

The village lies within Zell am See District in the western part of the Austrian state of Salzburg.  Geography  The cadastral community lies in the Upper Pinzgau at the southern foot of the 2,225 m high Wildkogel in the municipality of Bramberg and west of the municipality of Hollersbach im Pinzgau. A stream of the same name flows through M√ºhlbach and it is one of the few tributaries in the Upper Pinzgau that empties into the Salzach river from the north. Its valley runs from the village of M√ºhlbach upstream in a curve, first in a northerly direction and then swings westwards behind the Wildkogel.  History  In ancient times the region was a mining centre for copper ore and M√ºhlbach im Pinzgau was the seat of a mining commission (Berghauptmannschaft). Mining in M√ºhlbach was first mentioned in 1425 in the records and was in the possession of the Mannlich family from Augsburg in Bavaria until the mines were sold to the archbishop of Salzburg in 1638. In 1863 the mines were closed and subsequent attempts to reopen them failed. Nevertheless there are still numerous house and farm names that recall past mining functions, for example: Knappenstubn, √ñfner, Grubenh√ºter, Schmirber, Verwalter, Handelsschmied and more besides. Worth a visit is the building in which the former imperial and royal forestry commission was housed. Today, this building is the home of \\"Bramberg Mining Research\\" (Bergbauforschung Bramberg), a club that is concerned with the history of mining and, in particular, research into mining in the Upper Pinzgau.  Transport  The main road to the village is the B 165 federal highway. Local public transport services that stop in M√ºhlbach include buses of the Salzburger Verkehrsverbund and Austrian Postbus companies running between Krimml and Zell am See, as well as the Pinzgauer Lokalbahn, which enables connexions to the Austrian main line network in Zell am See.  Sport and leisure  The municipality of Bramberg, with just under 4,000 inhabitants, manages to field two football clubs, TSU Bramberg and SC M√ºhlbach. Both teams play in the 2nd Landesliga South which is the second highest league in the state of Salzburg. There is also a public open-air swimming pool in M√ºhlbach and various winter sports facilities. In addition the village lies on the Tauern Cycleway, an Austrian long-distance cycle path.

Born in San Francisco in 1926, Dietrich was the daughter of Richard Dietrich, who worked in the import business, and his wife, Marion. Dietrich began flying at an early age, getting a student pilot certificate at age 16. She and identical twin sister Janet Dietrich were the only girls in an aviation class at Burlingame High School. In 1947, Marion Dietrich and her sister Janet entered the inaugural Chico-to-San Mateo Air Race and took first place, defeating experienced men. Dietrich graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949, with degrees in mathematics and psychology. After placing in other local racess, the flying twins collected the second- place trophy in the 1951 All-Women's Transcontinental Air Race, known as the Powder Puff Derby. Dietrich worked for a time as a newspaper reporter for the Oakland Tribune, flying supersonic as a passenger in a fighter aircraft on a story assignment. She also became a commercial transport pilot, flying charter and ferry flights. In 1960, Dietrich and her sister were among a select group of female aviators invited to the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, where experts had screened potential NASA astronauts. The women underwent the same medical tests and examinations as Alan Shepard, John Glenn, and the other men who eventually traveled into space. The extensive exams included everything from swallowing 3 feet of rubber hose to drinking radioactive water. Though only 5 feet 3 inches tall and 100 pounds, Dietrich completed the regimen of tests, as did her sister and 11 other women. While the women waited for the next phase of their program in July 1961, the testing was halted without warning or explanation. It would be two more decades before the United States launched its first woman into space, Sally Ride, an astrophysicist turned astronaut. Dietrich died in 1974 from cancer. In 2006, the International Women's Air & Space Museum opened an exhibit honoring the Mercury 13 - Mercury Women: Forgotten Link to the Future. In May 2007, the Mercury 13 received honorary doctor of science degrees from the University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/17/BA4211A0VO.DTL#ixzz1DxgTd0AI References Category:1926 births Category:American astronauts Category:1974 deaths Category:Project Mercury Category:Mercury 13 Category:Aviators from California Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni ","title":"Marion Dietrich"},{"id":"30612842","text":"Mary Wallace \\"Wally\\" Funk (born February 1, 1939) is an American aviator and Goodwill Ambassador. She was the first female air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, the first female civilian flight instructor at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and the first female Federal Aviation Agency inspector, as well as one of the Mercury 13. Early life Funk was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico in 1939 and grew up in Taos, New Mexico. Her parents owned a variety store. The family had a collection of artwork from artists at the Taos art colony, as the artists would trade artwork to pay off their debt at the store. As a child, Funk was captivated by planes. When she was a one-year-old, her parents took her to an airport near where they lived in New Mexico and she got up close to a Douglas DC-3, an early airliner. \\"I go right to the wheel and I try to turn the nut,\\" she says. \\"Mother said: 'She‚Äôs going to fly.'\\" She became interested in mechanics and built model airplanes and ships. By the time she was seven, she was making planes from balsa wood. At nine, she had her first flying lesson. Funk was also an accomplished outdoorswoman, spending time riding her bike or her horse, skiing, hunting, and fishing. At the age of 14, she became an expert marksman, receiving the Distinguished Rifleman's Award. The National Rifle Association sent her incredible shooting results to the president, Dwight Eisenhower, and he wrote back to her. At the same time she represented the southwestern United States as Top Female Skier, Slalom and Downhill races in United States competition. Education and flight school As a high school student, Funk wanted to take courses such as mechanical drawing and auto mechanics, but because she was a girl, she was only permitted to take courses such as home economics. Frustrated, Funk left high school early at the age of 16 and entered Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri. Funk became a member of the \\"Flying Susies\\" and rated first in her class of 24 fliers. She graduated in 1958 with her pilot's license and an Associate of Arts degree. Funk moved on to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Secondary Education at Oklahoma State University, drawn there primarily by their famous \\"Flying Aggies\\" program. While at OSU, Funk earned a large number of aviation instrumentation and instruction ratings, including her Commercial, Single-engine Land, Multi-engine Land, Single-engine Sea, Instrument, Flight Instructor's, and all Ground Instructor's ratings. Funk was elected as an officer of the \\"Flying Aggies\\" and flew for them in the International Collegiate Air Meets. She received the \\"Outstanding Female Pilot\\" trophy, the \\"Flying Aggie Top Pilot\\" and the \\"Alfred Alder Memorial Trophy\\" two years in succession. In 1964, her work in aviation was recognized when she became the youngest woman in the history of Stephen's College to receive the Alumna Achievement Award. Aviation career At 20 years old, Funk became a professional aviator. Her first job was at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, as a Civilian Flight Instructor of noncommissioned and commissioned officers of the United States Army. Funk was the first female flight instructor at a US military base. In the fall of 1961, she accepted a job as a Certified Flight Instructor, Charter, and Chief Pilot with an aviation company in Hawthorne, California. Funk earned her Airline Transport Rating in 1968, the 58th woman in the U.S. to do so. She applied to three commercial airlines but, like other qualified female pilots, was turned away because of her gender. In 1971, Funk earned the rating of flight instructor from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), becoming the first woman to complete the FAA's General Aviation Operations Inspector Academy course,which includes Pilot Certification and Flight Testing procedures, handling accidents and violations. She worked for four years with the FAA as a field examiner, the first woman to do so. In 1973 she was promoted to FAA SWAP (Systems Worthiness Analysis Program) as a specialist, the first woman in the United States to hold this position. In late November 1973, Wally again entered the FAA Academy to take courses involving air-taxi, charter, and aviation rental businesses. In 1974, Funk was hired by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as its first female Air Safety Investigator. Funk investigated 450 accidents, ranging from a probable mob hit to a fatal crash at a mortuary. She made the discovery that people who die in small-plane crashes often have their jewelry, shoes and clothes stripped off by the impact. Concurrently, Funk participated in many air races. She placed 8th in the Powder Puff Derby's 25th Annual Race, 6th in the Pacific Air Race and 8th in the Palms to Pines Air Race. On August 16, 1975, she placed second in the Palms to Pines All Women Air Race from Santa Monica, California to Independence, Oregon. On October 4, 1975, flying her red and white Citabria, Wally won the Pacific Air Race from San Diego, California to Santa Rosa, California against 80 participating competitors. Funk retired from her post as an Air Safety Investigator in 1985 after serving for 11 years. Funk was then appointed an FAA Safety Counselor and became a renowned pilot trainer and speaker on aviation safety. In 1986, she was the key speaker for the US at The World Aviation Education and Safety Congress. In 1987, Funk was appointed Chief Pilot at Emery Aviation College, Greeley, Colorado, overseeing the entire flight programs for 100 students from Private to Multi-engine flight Instructor and Helicopter ratings. Funk has been chief pilot for five aviation schools across the country. To date, as a professional Flight Instructor she has soloed more than 700 students and put through 3,000 Private, Commercial, Multi-engine, Seaplane, Glider, Instrument, CFI, Al and Air Transport Pilots. Space career In February 1961, Funk volunteered for the \\"Women in Space\\" Program. The program was run by William Randolph Lovelace and had the support of NASA, although it lacked official government sponsorship. Funk contacted Lovelace, detailing her experience and achievements. Despite being younger than the recruiting age range of 25-40, Funk was invited to take part. Twenty-five women were invited, 19 enrolled, and 13 graduated, including Funk, who at 21 was the youngest. On some tests, she scored better than John Glenn. The media dubbed the group the \\"Mercury 13\\", a reference to the Mercury 7. Like the other participants in the program, Funk was put through rigorous physical and mental testing. In one test, volunteers were placed in sensory deprivation tanks. Funk was in the tank, without hallucinating, for 10 hours and 35 minutes, a record. She passed her tests and was qualified to go into space. She scored higher than John Glenn did in his testing and was the third best in the Mercury 13 program. Despite this, the program was canceled before the women were to undergo their last test. After the Mercury 13 program was canceled, Funk became a Goodwill Ambassador. Funk has continued to dream of going to space. When NASA finally began accepting women in the late 1970s, Funk applied three times. Despite her impressive credentials, she was turned down for not having an engineering degree or a background as a test pilot. In 1995, Lt. Col. Eileen Collins became the first woman to pilot a space shuttle into space; Funk was too old to qualify to become a space shuttle pilot by the time Collins became one. Funk and six other members of the Mercury 13 were invited guests of Collins at the launch, and NASA gave them a behind-the-scenes VIP tour of the Kennedy Space Center complex. In 2012, she put money down to be one of the first people to fly into space via Virgin Galactic. The money for the flight came from Funk's own book and film royalties and family money. Today Funk currently lives in Roanoke, Texas. She enjoys sports and restoring antique automobiles, with a collection that includes a 1951 Hooper Silver Wraith. She has over 19,000 flight hours and still flies every Saturday as an instructor.

She was also the second woman to exceed Mach One.  Life before the Mercury 13  Jean Hixson was born in Hoopeston, Illinois. Hixson had always had a passion to excel at what she did. Hixson began taking flying lessons at age 16 and was able to get her pilot's license by the age of 18. After Hixson received her license, she began to train with the Women's Air force Service Pilots (WASP). During World War II Hixson flew B-25 Mitchells as an engineering test pilot. After WWII, she became a flight instructor in Akron, Ohio. After hours, she attended Akron University and received a degree in Elementary and Secondary Education. In 1957 Hixson also became the second woman to exceed the speed of sound, in a Lockheed F-94C Starfire flying at over 840 mph.  Mercury 13 and sexual discrimination  The Mercury 13 was a group of women who underwent the same physical and psychological testing as male astronauts in 1959 to train for mission Mercury. These women were found to have a higher tolerance to the physical and emotional strains that would be put on them were they to go on this mission. Not only were these women found to be more resistant to the strains that would placed on them, but it would have actually been less expensive to send these women to space. The reason for this is because the women weighed less and were smaller, meaning they needed less food and oxygen than their male counterparts. There was later an interview with John Glenn in which the full understanding of sexism in this situation was revealed. After the Mercury 13 were disbanded, he was recorded saying in an interview, \\"I think this gets back to the way our social order is organized‚Ä¶.It is just a fact. The men go off and fight the wars and fly the airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them. The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order\\". The fact that an astronaut was not fearful to make this statement in front of a congressional hearing shows that this was a widespread thought at the time and explains why NASA was still willing to turn down a candidate who they deemed to be the best in the group.  Life after Mercury 13  After testing in the Mercury 13 program, Hixson went to work at the Flight Simulator Techniques branch of the USAF Reserve at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. In 1982, she retired from the Air Force Reserves as a Colonel, and that same year chaired a WASP reunion. In 1983 she completed 30 years of service with the Akron (Ohio) School system. Jean died of cancer at age 62 on September 21, 1984.

He paid ¬£120 as a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù (deposit discounting future ground rents) to secure the property, and another ¬£130 to buy out the property from ground rent when the National Land Company was dissolved. This is the largest amount paid for a plot in a Chartist village. The original building had two bedrooms, a living room, dairy, store, back hall with well and pump, plus an adjoining piggery, coal house and privy. Alterations were made to the cottage. A stable was added before 1889, to help carry market garden produce (strawberries, pears and plums) to market in Birmingham. The piggery was converted to a laundry some time between 1915‚Äì20, probably as keeping pigs was less necessary as the village‚Äôs market garden economy was reasonably profitable. Alterations were made in the 1930s to include an extra bedroom in place of the old store and a new kitchen where the laundry room was, as well as new sitting room where the dairy had once been.

Founded in 1997 by Paul Travers, Vuzix is a supplier of wearable display technology, virtual reality and augmented reality. Vuzix manufactures and sells computer display devices and software. Vuzix personal display devices are used for mobile and immersive augmented reality applications, such as 3D gaming, manufacturing training, and military tactical equipment. On January 5, 2015, Intel acquired 30% of Vuzix's stock for $24.8 million. The Company has offices in New York, Japan, and the UK and is the current market leader for video eyewear. Forte was a pioneer during the mid-1990s developing immersive head mounted displays for Virtual Reality and video gaming applications. History Paul Travers founded Vuzix in 1997 in Rochester, NY, under the name Interactive Imaging Systems, purchasing the assets of the virtual reality company Forte Technologies. The company started with products for the military and U.S. Defense, but then developed consumer virtual reality systems and was the first company to deliver consumer virtual reality. In 1997, the Company was hired as a subcontractor to Raytheon, designing display electronics for a digital night vision weapon sight. In 2000, the VFX1 Headgear was featured in a commemorative US Postal Service stamp collection celebrating the 1990s. The VFX1 was replaced by a higher resolution system dubbed the VFX3D in mid 2000. In 2001, Vuzix launched its first consumer electronics product, the iCOM personal internet browser. In 2005, Vuzix provided a custom high resolution handheld display system that created the 3D imagery for Hitachi's pavilion at the 2005 World‚Äôs Fair in Aichi, Japan. The Hitachi Pavilion allowed users to interact with computer generated models and dioramas of endangered species in a Mixed Reality ride. In 2005, the company changed its name to Icuiti. Later that year, Icuiti launched its first product designed specifically for consumers, the V920 Video Eyewear. Also in 2005, Icuiti was awarded its first military R&D; contract to develop a high resolution monocular display device for viewing tactical maps and video. This development would lead to the Tac-Eye product line, which began rate production in 2009 and is currently used in many major military programs including the Battlefield Air Operations kit. A re-branding in 2007 changed the Company's name from Icuiti to Vuzix.http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/icuiti-changes-name-to-vuzix-corporation-57757517.html In 2010, Vuzix introduced the first production model see-through augmented reality glasses the STAR 1200. It was released in August 2011 for $4999. Vuzix is currently under contract with DARPA to design and build a next generation heads up display for military ground personnel. The DARPA PCAS program is large R&D; program with the goal of allowing the joint tactical air controller the ability to rapidly engage multiple, moving and simultaneous targets within his area of responsibility. In January 2013, at CES, Vuzix Corporation demonstrated working models of its new M100 Smart Glasses, the official press event of CES. Rated as one of the five top gadgets expected at CES by CNBC and given the CES Innovations award, the Vuzix Smart Glasses M100, expected to ship in second half of 2013, will enable wearers to access data and content from an iOS or Android smart phone from the cloud and ‚Äòhands free‚Äô. The m100 was officially released in December 2013 for $1000: double the original announced price. In January 2015, Intel invested $25 million in the company, gaining 30% ownership of the company. In August 2017, Vuzix and BlackBerry became partners to deliver smart glasses for the enterprise.

Background Incumbent representative Manuel Sanchez was unseated after the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal ruled that he is an American citizen. A special election was then called, scheduled for March 7, 1994. Six candidates participated including Rogelio Sanchez Silvestre, Sanchez's nephew, former House majority leader Francisco Sumulong, former assemblyman Gilberto Duavit, Sr. of the opposition Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), and three independent candidates: chess grandmaster Rosendo Balinas Jr., lawyer Eduardo Inlayo and peasant leader Elmer Panotes. Sumulong previously served as representative but gave up his seat to run unsuccessfully in the 1992 Senate election. Sumulong was supported by presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos. Duavit was supported by Rizal governor Casimiro Ynares and vice president Joseph Estrada, while Silvestre was backed by former Senate President Jovito Salonga and other Liberal Party stalwarts. Cainta and Taytay were expected to provide the swing votes as neither of the candidates are from those two municipalities, and that many residents there were immigrants from other parts of the country. Turnout was expected to be low as no holiday was declared on election day. Result Duavit won over former Francisco Sumulong by 21,034 votes. The low turnout of 37% was blamed on Rizal's traffic problems, and the inability of employees and students to cast their votes when they reside outside the district during the workweek/school week.

The church has been described as \\"one of the finest and most important small medieval churches in South Essex, and of exceptional architectural, archaeological and historical significance\\". Notable features include the complex plan form and development, Norman font and doors with original fittings and the medieval woodwork including a priest's room. The site is also of \\"considerable, possibly exceptional, archaeological significance\\". Location The church is situated to the east of Eastwood which is now a suburb of Southend-on-Sea, a large urban conurbation on the Thames estuary, which is part of the Thames Gateway regeneration project. The church stands in Eastwoodbury Lane, close to its junction with Aviation Way; Eastwoodbury Lane once crossed directly under the flight path into the main runway of Southend Airport until the runway was extended when a new road named St Laurence Way was built to allow cars to pass the end of the newly extended runway. To the east, the churchyard borders on the wire fence at the boundary of the airport with aircraft regularly landing close to the church. History =Eastwood= Eastwood took its name from its situation on the eastern side of the woods and parkland of Rayleigh and Thundersley which were part of the Great Forest of Essex. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Estwa\\", and was held by Suen of Essex, whose father Robert had held it during the reign of Edward the Confessor. Suen's son, Robert of Essex, founded Prittlewell Priory in the year 1100, but his grandson, Henry of Essex, forfeited all his estates to the Crown in 1163, after being charged with treason and cowardice in battle. After this date the manor was generally held by the Crown. In the 13th century, the English Kings would often visit the district for hunting, making Hadleigh Castle their residence. Henry VIII was the last king known to have hunted here and Eastwood Lodge was the centre of the last reserved portion of hunting land. In 1536, during the Reformation, the Manor was given by Edward VI to Lord Rich whose descendants became Earls of Warwick, then by marriage it passed to the Earl of Nottingham. The Bristow family purchased the estate and held it until 1866 when it was sold in lots: \\"Eastwoodbury\\", the large house which stood immediately to the east of the Church, was on the site of the original Manor house. It was demolished in 1954. In the course of the centuries this parish of 3,000 acres, with its scattered population, changed from woodland to an agricultural parish and today to a largely built-up area. =History of the church= The first known record of the church is in 1100 A.D. when Robert Fitz Suen (Robert d'Essex) gave the chapels of Eastwood, Sutton and Prittlewell to the Prior of Prittlewell. It is evident that there was a church at Eastwood before that date; this was probably the present Norman nave with a small apsidal chancel. The antiquity of the site is borne out by the presence of a sarsen stone built into the walls. There are claims that this is the remains from when the site was used for pagan worship. The early development of the church is still not completely understood. The nave is 12th-century in origin, with Norman window openings in the north wall. The south aisle was added in the 13th century and the north aisle in the 14th. The chancel is 13th-century, with a 14th-century roof. The nave roof is 15th-century. The brick south porch was added in the 16th century. There were extensive works within the church in the 1870s when it was thoroughly restored by William White, including new seating. The broach spire was restored in the late 20th century. The church exterior The church is built of ragstone rubble with some flint and has limestone dressings; there is also some Roman and Tudor brickwork. The south wall of the south aisle shows the original rubble with red Tudor brickwork on the top, three to four feet in depth and above the windows. In the south-east corner, the stone has given way and been replaced by Tudor brick, reinforced by a Tudor brick buttress. At some time, the east wall of the north aisle had cracked badly and been repaired very roughly by Tudor brickwork above the window. The exterior was covered with cement rendering which was completely removed in 1971. The plaster can be seen in a drawing of the church from 1849. The records show that in the early 17th century the church was in a ruinous state; this was borne out when the old exterior plastering was stripped off. The church stands within a large churchyard containing monuments including chest tombs dating back to the 18th century, with 20th-century extensions to the north containing several war graves. The churchyard is a pleasant area of trees, grass and wild flowers, carefully managed for its wildlife value. The church was popular with gypsies and other members of the travelling community who used it for christenings, marriages and funerals. The so-called \\"King of the Gypsies\\", Louis Boswell, was buried at Eastwood church in 1835. In the Burial Register he is described as a \\"Traveller aged 42\\" ‚Äì \\"This man known as the King of the Gypsies was interred in the presence of a vast concourse of spectators\\". There is a large modern brick vestry off the north aisle. =The tower= The small tower, which is square, has a timber-framed and shingled upper part, with a broach spire, which was restored in the 20th century. Unusually, it is positioned at the west end of the south aisle. The lower stage is early-13th-century but the upper stage is modern. The presence of Tudor brick buttresses outside suggest that the upper portion became unsafe and was taken down. The spire was repaired by the Canadian Government after the Second World War as a lasting memorial to airmen who had flown from Southend during the war. =Bells= There are three original bells, two 14th- century and one 17th-century; there was a fourth bell which had disappeared. For many years the ancient wooden bell frame had been unsafe for ringing, although the tenor bell could be tolled. In 1984 the tower was strengthened to hold a new metal bell frame and the three old bells were re-hung and augmented to a ring of six by the addition of three lighter bells. During this work, one of the old bells (now the 5th) which was cracked was repaired by welding. The inscriptions on the bells are: *Tenor: Sancta Gregori ora pro nobis (St. Gregory pray for us) (Cast 1380) *No. 5: Sancta Katerina ora pro nobis (St. Katherine pray for us) (Cast 1380) *No. 4: Charles Newman made me (Cast 1693) *No. 3: We praise thee O God (in memory of Ethel & Gladys Fowler of Cockethurst Farm) (Cast 1985) *No. 2: O come let us sing unto the Lord (in memory of Ranie & May Fowler of Cockethurst Farm) (Cast 1985) *Treble: Unto thee O Lord do we give thanks (The gift of Mable Free) (Cast 1985) The three new bells were cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The church interior Tradition has it that St Laurence (to whom the church was dedicated) was martyred on a gridiron (in 258) and the church layout is said to take the form of a gridiron, with the chancel representing the handle and the nave and two side aisles the bars. The interior is thickly plastered and whitewashed, with traces of medieval painted decoration. The nave is fully pewed, with plain benches and choir stalls from the White restoration. =The porch= The porch dates from the 16th century, pre-reformation, and is built in brick. The roof timber was old timber reused. There is a pre-Reformation niche over the door and a holy water stoup on the east side of the doorway. =The chancel= The chancel, measuring by , dates from the 13th century with a 14th-century roof. The chancel arch is 14th-century, plain with no mouldings and traces of an earlier roof gable above it, and preserving two sawn-off ends of the rood beam. The roof has braced collar beams and the two tie beams are moulded. The east window has been restored with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century. The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding to the window in the north wall. The other is a low side window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess. This window was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter and may have been used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host. To the east of this is a priest's door, recently replaced. There are traces of a piscina behind the panelling on the north wall. Before the altar are 18th-century tombs of the Vassal family, former owners of Cockethurst Farm, and a brass effigy of Thomas Burroughs dated 1600. =The nave= The nave measures by and dates from the 12th century and is the oldest part of the church. The nave roof is 15th-century with massive tie beams. Four of the trusses have octagonal crown posts of unusual workmanship for a village Church. When the roof was re-tiled in 1935, the 7\\" x 7\\" beams were found to be as sound as when originally installed. The original Norman windows can be seen in the north wall with traces of two others also visible. There were probably three windows in each wall of the original Norman Church. In the 13th century, the first alteration to the original church was the piercing of the south wall by three Early English bays and the building of the south aisle. The octagonal columns have moulded capitals and bases and brick plinths. The angles of two columns have been flattened to give a view of the altar to the ringer in the tower and the easternmost arch has a curiously chamfered portion, the purpose of which is uncertain. At the junction of this arcade with the chancel are two 13th- century recesses, one having been cut away and afterwards filled up, and the other pierced to allow access to the south aisle. A hagioscope or squint has been cut in a very simple manner through the angle of the chancel wall giving a view of the high altar from the south aisle. The best alteration was the piercing of the north wall by two wide 14th-century arches. These arches have no supporting columns but spring from the wall direct and the easternmost arch shows some of 13th-century capping, probably of a former recess cut away when the arcade was made. =The south aisle= The south aisle is wide was added in the 13th century and altered in the 15th century when the roof was raised to incorporate a clerestory which was never completed. The roof comprises two plastered gables. The addition to the height can be seen on the interior wall. The east window is of uncertain date and has been modernised. There are two windows in the south wall. The eastern one is 14th-century with two trefoil lights and is square-headed, with modern glass. The sill is a stone slab with a moulded edge, probably from a tomb or altar. The other window is one, wide pointed, 13th-century light (probably a lancet window reduced) with modern glass showing St Laurence with gridiron. This aisle was formerly used as a side chapel as the 14th-century piscina and aumbry indicate and may have been a Lady Chapel. There are slight traces of colouring on the pillar below the eastern end of the arcade and holes which may indicate support for a statue. It has now been restored to use as a side chapel. On the stonework level with the pews, are two scratched figures or graffiti, one of a knight in armour and the other a curious serpent-like figure. The ancient chest is situated in this aisle. The font The font is remarkable for its unusual figure and peculiar form. It is the best example in Essex of a late Norman or Early English font, (late 12th century), shown by the semicircular arcading round the drum interlaced to form pointed arches and by slender shafting. =The north aisle= The north aisle is wide and dates from the 14th century. In the east wall is a 14th-century Late Decorated window with two cinquefoil windows which has been partly restored. In the north wall is a 14th-century doorway, the 12th-century door is similar to the South door. At the west end of the north aisle is a small and unusual 15th-century priests' room ‚Äì an oak framed apartment of two stages lighted by a small 15th-century square-headed window. This has a heavy plank and muntin screen with narrow door and roof of heavy joists supporting the upper floor. The screen is 15th-century oak with a moulded and embattled head and rail. The door is narrow, massive and nail studded. The use of this chamber is unknown, it may have been the sacristy and muniment room or a priests' room to accommodate the monk when the Church was served by Prittlewell Priory. The hinges of the door and the trap door are probably original. The lower chamber is now used as the Vicar's vestry and there is an oak bier, dated 1706, in the upper chamber. In this aisle is a tombstone of Elizabeth Hooker (1666), another with the brasses torn off and an oak table thought to have been used as a Communion table during the time of Cromwell. =The church doors= The south doorway, which is 13th-century, Early English, has lost its original character, being now square-headed. This door and the north door inside the church are the most interesting in the district because of the strap ironwork on both. The horizontal strap of the south door has an inscription in Lombardic letters which reads \\"Pax regat intrantes eadem regat egredientes\\" (\\"May peace rule those entering and also those leaving\\"). This ironwork is 12th- or even 11th-century, probably the work of a local smith and an excellent example of early craftsmanship. The south door has a triangular knocker generally regarded as a Sanctuary knocker. The rolls of King Edward 1st show that, when he was hunting in the district, he granted a pardon to a criminal at Eastwood who had stolen three pigs. The man was condemned to be hanged but the rope broke; he escaped to the church for sanctuary until he was pardoned. He was afterwards exiled. The north door was repaired and re-hung as the entrance to the new Choir Vestry in 1966 using locally made bricks and tiles of Tudor decoration. The north door may be somewhat earlier than the south as its ironwork is a little simpler. =Stained glass= The east window, by Cox, Sons, Buckley & Co., dates from 1887. The west window has modern stained glass from 1978 by Francis Skeat depicting the life of Samuel Purchas geographer and writer and Eastwood's most notable incumbent. The south wall window from 1964 depicts St Laurence. =The organ= The church organ is situated in one of the arches pierced into the north wall. It is a small two-manual pipe organ by Rushworth and Dreaper, from 1925, which was originally in Wesley Hall, Westcliff-on-Sea. It was installed in St Laurence by Martin Cross in 1976 who restored it in 2004. Churchyard The churchyard contains war graves of two service personnel of World War I and eight of World War II.

Expansion of London Southend Airport The London Southend Airport has a fairly short runway which prevents the use of large aircraft at the same time as other airports around London are congested. It was even shorter before an expansion in 2011‚Äì2012. The proximity of the church to the end of the runway historically created difficulties for the airport operation and plans to expand the capacity of the airport, causing the airport operator to put forward several proposals, including complete demolition of the church or moving it to a new location away from the airport's safety zone. =The 2001 proposals= In October 2001, the airport operators announced plans to expand the airport which included extending the runway by . Under these proposals, it was planned to move the church out of the way, by using rollers or stilts, and to realign Eastwoodbury Lane. According to the airport authorities, moving the church closer to Aviation Way to enable it to build special buffer zones into the runway to meet tougher safety rules imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority. The proposed move of the church would have required the creation of a \\"chassis\\" underneath the walls of the building to turn it into a \\"railway carriage\\". A track would have been laid, supported by concrete piles, to enable the building to be moved and lowered into its final position. Protesters claimed that such a move would cost up to ¬£2 million and would disrupt graves and burial sites under the church itself. In November, the local council backed the proposals in principle as long as various outstanding issues could be resolved but protesters, supported by local M.P. David Amess and by English Heritage, called for a public inquiry. At a public meeting held on 24 November, organised by Friends of the Earth, protesters were \\"overwhelmingly\\" of the view that the church should not be moved despite the council's support for the plans and the employment that would be generated by the airport expansion. In December, airport director Roger Campbell claimed that the proposal to move the church was the \\"only choice\\" available. This was rejected by local councillors, who suggested that the runway could have been extended at the northern end by putting the railway into a tunnel. This proposal was in turn rejected by Mr. Campbell, on the grounds that it was not \\"viable\\". The plans to move the church were rejected by English Heritage, who claimed \\"that no church that old has been moved before\\". Andrew Derrick, inspector of historic buildings at English Heritage, said: \\"We are very concerned about plans to move the church. It is a fine, historic and unspoiled church with some very important features.\\" In January 2002, in the face of continuing protests, Roger Campbell claimed that the airport could face closure if its expansion plans failed but, after a meeting between the church leaders and airport authorities, churchwarden Richard Huband reassured protesters that there would be no disturbance to graves should the move go ahead. On 16 January, it was announced that the church had had its listing upgraded to Grade 1 status. Announcing the decision, Andrew Derrick stated: > \\"Grade I is the right grade for St. Laurence's Church and it confirms it as > a very important building. Only the two per cent most important buildings in > the country are Grade I listed so now the church is in the same bracket as > the most important buildings. This means that demolishing the church would > be unthinkable. Any decision on moving the church will have to go through > the local planning authority, but being Grade I listed will make a > difference on how people view the building.\\" On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated: > \\"The decision was simple ‚Äì the church has to move if the airport is to > survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go > ahead, will be lost. It is not just a case of expansion. We have to comply > with safety standards set down by the Civil Aviation Authority and they must > be implemented. The future hinges on these plans.\\" The vicar of the church, Rev. Nigel Ransom, was delighted at the news. > \\"I was not surprised to hear from English Heritage that the church has been > upgraded to a Grade I listed building. It is a unique and historic place. > For more than 1,000 years the church has stood on this site undisturbed. It > is shrouded in history and is truly a magnificent example of architecture. > The decision by English Heritage will certainly make it more difficult for > any plans to move the church. The local community is firmly against any > changes and so am I.\\" In May 2002, the parochial church council voted to reject the proposals to move the church giving Rev. Nigel Ransom the power to block the proposals. Despite this, the airport vowed to continue with their expansion plans and were in the process of preparing formal documents to submit to Southend Council in a bid to get planning permission. Protesters vowed to \\"fight to the bitter end\\" with local councillors being united in their opposition to the proposals. In October 2002, as it became clear that the plans to move the church in its entirety would not be supported by the local authorities, the airport made a proposal to partly demolish the existing church by lowering its walls and removing the spire, leaving the church as a monument. Under this scheme, the airport would have provided a new church and hall \\"in a more convenient location\\". Like the previous plans, this was also rejected by the church and Rev. Ransom. Finally, in January 2003 the airport lodged proposals with Southend Council to completely demolish the church to allow for the expansion of the airport. A spokesman for the airport said: \\"The location of the church causes a breach of CAA safety regulations but airport owners are committed to moving the church intact or giving the parish an alternative building.\\" MP David Amess continued to oppose the plans to demolish or move the church, saying \\"St. Laurence Church should be left alone.\\" He also criticised the rules which prevented local councillors public announcing their views on controversial planning applications. In February 2003, the local Leigh-on-Sea town council voted to support the airport's expansion plans \\"on the proviso that disruption to St. Laurence church was minimised by moving, not demolishing it.\\" Shortly afterwards, consultants appointed by the airport arranged a meeting with English Heritage to discuss the feasibility of moving the church. On 2 April 2003, Southend Council unanimously rejected the planning application as the airport had not given sufficient reasons to require disturbing a 1,000-year-old building and because the proposal was in breach of several of the council's planning guidelines and the district plan. In August 2003, the airport announced plans to lodge an appeal against the decision of the local council. In December 2003, the threat to the church began to be lifted when it was announced that permission had been granted for the installation of an Instrument Landing System on the land on the opposite side of Eastwoodbury Lane to the airport runway. This would be coupled with the installation of traffic lights and barriers in Eastwoodbury Lane either side of the landing zone to prevent traffic crossing under the path of aircraft as they come into land. Despite this, the airport did not immediately cancel its planned appeal, much to the dismay of the local council; in March the airport announced that the appeal would be withdrawn \\"as soon as all the safety checks had been done and final go-ahead given by the Civil Aviation Authority\\". This was expected to be by the end of June. The appeal was finally withdrawn in November 2004, after the Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that the safety improvements put in place were sufficient to enable the necessary safety zones to be created and permit the return of commercial flights to the airport. As a result, all plans to move or demolish the church had been withdrawn. =The 2008 proposals= In January 2008, it was announced that the C.A.A. had given consent in principle to plans for a major expansion of the airport including a new terminal, control tower and railway station, together with a new hotel. The plans also involved the extension of the main runway by over Eastwoodbury Lane. This would require the diversion of Eastwoodbury Lane but would not have any serious impact on the church. At the same time, it was announced that the airport operators, Regional Airports, had put the airport up for sale and were seeking a buyer who could finance the anticipated ¬£35 million cost of the planned improvements. In December 2008, the airport was acquired by Stobart Air, a subsidiary of the Stobart transport group in a ¬£21 million deal, with the intention of expanding the airport as a \\"niche air- freight destination\\" and attracting new passenger services. The new owners said that they \\"would work with the local council to discuss ways of developing the airport's potential, including the possibility of an extended runway which could help meet the undoubted demand for European business and leisure travel\\". In June 2009, outline plans were announced to divert Eastwoodbury Lane to accommodate the proposed runway extension; under these proposals two groups of cottages at either side of the runway would be demolished together with a section of the church wall. On 13 October 2009, a formal planning application was submitted to extend the runway in a south- westerly direction, by diverting Eastwoodbury Lane, together with the provision of a new cycleway and footpath around the extended runway. The plan also required the removal of a section of the church wall and its replacement by a yew hedge and the provision of a turning circle outside the church. The airport considered that although the proposals would have no direct impact on the church building, the additional air traffic would have a moderate to slight adverse impact on the setting of the church. This would be mitigated by the improved church entrance and the lack of passing vehicle traffic which will provide an overall enhancement to the tranquility of the area. It was made clear that the application did not involve the demolition of St Laurence and All Saints Church. On 20 January 2010, Southend Council's Development Control Committee approved the runway extension plan although the recommendation was sent to the Communities Secretary John Denham for review. On 19 March 2010, John Denham approved the plans for the airport's development without the need for a public inquiry. In July 2010, a small protest group against the airport expansion lodged an application for a Judicial review of the planning application; this was initially dismissed in the High Court in February 2011, as was a subsequent challenge. The new road diversion opened in August 2011, and Eastwoodbury Lane, in the area in-line with the runway, was stopped up on 1 September 2011, thus enabling the works required to extend the runway to be commenced.

It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.14. The distance to this star is approximately 168 light years, as determined by parallax, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of 5 km/s. The position of this star near the ecliptic means it is subject to lunar occultations. This object is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of G9IIIb. Having exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core, it has cooled and expanded; at present it has 12.3 times the girth of the Sun. The star has an estimated mass about 47% greater than the Sun. It is radiating about 68 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of about . It is probably on the red giant branch, which indicates it is generating energy through hydrogen fusion in a shell outside an inert helium core. However, there is a 41% chance that it is a red clump giant on the horizontal branch, which would mean it was somewhat older and less massive. It has sometimes been classified spectroscopically as a subgiant, but detailed study shows that it is too cool and luminous to be on the subgiant branch.

History Wiggins started Essex Chanel to go in a different musical direction than his first band, Fetla. After Fetla went on a 2-year hiatus in 2005, Essex Chanel became Wiggins‚Äôs primary project. Most of Essex Chanel‚Äôs prolific recorded output is arranged and produced by Wiggins. Wiggins likes to experiment and use different musical styles from release-to- release, sometimes even from song-to-song. ‚ÄúWith each album, I go in a different direction. I challenge myself,‚Äù Wiggins said in the RedEye. In November 2010, Essex Chanel released song number 250, The Good Times. The song was played on Chicago's WXRT-FM's Local Anesthetic. In January 2011, Essex Chanel confirmed they would be a guest on Chic-a-Go-Go. Musical Style and Influences Essex Chanel is typically categorized as indie rock, indie pop, or folk pop, but due to the experimentation of Wiggins‚Äô songwriting the music has fallen into an additional variety of music genres, including bluegrass, folk, Americana, dance/electronica, honky-tonk, alternative and classical, while still retaining mostly a pop-influenced base with an emphasis on melody, playfulness and orchestration. Essex Chanel is most commonly compared to Ween due to a similarity in the way both bands genre-jump and use a wide array of music influences, as well as the sense of humor both groups have. Essex Chanel's release Love is Proximity was compared to Sufjan Stevens, Arcade Fire, and The Magnetic Fields 69 Love Songs. Collaborators Wiggins has collaborated with many musicians for Essex Chanel: Stephen Dranger, Mike Regan, Allison Trumbo, Aleksandra Lederer, Mitch Nimnicht, Steven Aleck, Robert Pleshar, Micah Travisonno, Brian Koehler, Joseph Khalifah, Luke Krause, Angelina Lucero (who had played with Pretty Good Dance Moves), & Sara Ma. Music videos Essex Chanel broke into the national scene in 2010 with the release of a music video for the single \\"Skinny Dippin'.\\" The A.V.

With the opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal in 1827, people began to settle in this vicinity. By 1842, there was a water-powered mill, a large warehouse, a boat-yard, two stores and a hotel, and the population was around 300. A number of houses and other buildings dating back to that period remain. With the decrease in boat traffic on the canal the village declined somewhat, but its fortunes revived with the construction of the railway in 1880 and the arrival of the Cleveland‚ÄîAkron Bag Company in 1900. This industry drew in many Polish immigrant workers, and housing and commercial premises were built. Many of these buildings remain today, intermingled with the older properties. History Located in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Village of Boston Mills reflects the early 19th-century canal era and the early 20th- century industrial era. With the opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal from Cleveland to Akron in 1827, the settlement along the Cuyahoga River began to grow. By 1842, Boston Mills had a population of approximately 300. A water powered mill, a large warehouse, two stores and a hotel were some of the businesses in the village. Canal boat building was also an important industry with several dry docks in this inland port. Although the canal is not watered through the village now, one of the system's locks is still extant and several Greek Revival frame buildings date from the early 19th century. The Upwright and Wing house type reflects the extended New England settlement culture. This style is exemplified by the main gable-front two-story section containing a parlor and bedchambers, while the kitchen is located in a perpendicular one- story eave oriented section. The 1836 Boston Company Store, with its Federal and Greek Revival influences, now serves as a Cuyahoga Valley National Park visitor center and canal boat building museum. Although the village stagnated with the end of canal packet, or passenger boat era, the arrival of the Valley Railway in 1880 and the Cleveland‚ÄîAkron Bag Company in 1900 began a new period of growth. Connecting the industries of Cleveland with the coal fields in the south, the Valley Railway provided raw resources and access to markets for industrial operations. The Cleveland‚ÄîAkron Bag Company brought with it many Polish immigrant workers and new houses‚Äîbuilt and sold by the company. Several patterned concrete block houses and a school remain from this era, along with a company store building. A somewhat later 20th-century building, the M. D. Garage has been restored, including period gas pumps and signage, and now houses art exhibits. The compact nature of the village creates streetscapes that juxtapose the buildings from each era.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History The Valley Railway was constructed in 1880 to link Cleveland's growing steel industry and the rich coal fields of the Tuscarawas River Valley, extending south to Zoarville. Although the first railroad came to Cleveland in 1854, the majority of the rail lines ran east‚Äìwest and did not connect the metropolitan and industrial centers of Cleveland, Akron and Canton. The Valley Railway was built next to, and sometimes on top of, the Ohio and Erie Canal. The Valley Railway provided a faster transport for the coal needed to fuel the new industrial economy. Although the railway primarily functioned as an industrial and freight carrier, the railway published \\"The Travelers and Tourists Guide to the Valley Railway!\\" to promote its passenger service. This guidebook describes the origins and character of many towns and notable natural features along the route. The Valley Railway brought an increase in noise and pollution to the quiet rural valley. The guidebook was a common promotional piece used to make the railway seem more recreational than industrial. Many believed that the presence of the railroad in pastoral landscapes all around the country, referred to as the \\"machine in the garden,\\" represented a significant shift away from an agrarian society towards an industrial one. In 1895 the Valley Railway became the Cleveland, Terminal and Valley Railway. In 1915 the line was absorbed into the Baltimore and Ohio system. Although many small independent lines from this era were absorbed into larger lines and acquired parallel tracks, the Valley Railway retains single track alignment and has been well preserved. A great deal of the track runs through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which has preserved the cultural landscape of the valley and prevented modern intrusions into it. Today the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad runs excursion service extending from Cuyahoga County to Canton.

Halliday and Houston were selected to row the lightweight double at 2008 Summer Olympics and for the 2008 World Lightweight Championships in Linz Austria, Bennett's 2007 quad stayed together with Kelly changed-out for Tasmanian Ingrid Fenger. Bennett was in the three seat for their thrilling victory. At the 500 m mark the Australians sat in fourth place behind Poland, the United States and Great Britain. They lifted their rate in the middle half and moved ahead of the American and British crews and turned their attention to chasing down the Poles who held a one and a half second lead at the halfway mark. In the final 500 m Australia surged past Poland and stormed to the line to take the gold medal in a time of 6:36.41, almost three seconds clear of Poland.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Historic The Virginia Kendall State Park Historic District consists of approximately 530 acres in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and reflects the naturalistic landscape style and rustic architecture associated with the Civilian Conservation Corps. Cleveland coal baron and industrialist Hayward Kendall acquired this property in the first part of the 20th century for use as a hunting retreat. Upon his death in 1927 the property transferred to his wife, Agnes, with the stipulation that it would eventually become a park named in honor of his mother, Virginia. Agnes Kendall was not interested in the property and turned it over to the state in 1929. In 1933 Harold S. Wagner, the Director-Secretary of the Akron Metropolitan Park District filed with the National Park Service to create a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Virginia Kendall Park. Approval of the application required evidence of the ability to work with the rustic architecture style. Harold Wagner partnered with Akron architect Albert Good, who had previously designed the rustic lodges of the adjacent Boy Scout Camp Manatoc. Good went on to edit Park and Recreation Structures and Park Structures and Facilities, which are the definitive \\"parkitecture\\" books for the National Park Service. Virginia Kendall Park consists of four naturalistic style landscapes designed around the sandstone ledges that mark the prehistoric edges of Lake Erie. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the drives, parking areas, meadows and wooded areas were all carefully laid out using the National Park Service's master planning process. The buildings were incorporated into the landscape rather than the landscape framing the buildings. Man-made improvements to the landscape were designed to harmonize with the natural patterns. Locally quarried sandstone and wormy chestnut were used to construct numerous comfort stations and shelters that anchor \\"playstead\\" meadows. The shelters evidence sophisticated design and placement; the Octagon Shelter located on the top of a knoll, the Ledges Shelter's rectilinear plan parallels the ledge wall face and the Lake Shelter sited at the base of a hill that fronts the man-made lake surrounded by rolling hills.

Eigenforms fall into the realm of number theory, but can be found in other areas of math and science such as analysis, combinatorics, and physics. A common example of an eigenform, and the only non-cuspidal eigenforms, are the Eisenstein series. Another example is the Œî Function.  Normalization  There are two different normalizations for an eigenform (or for a modular form in general). = Algebraic normalization = An eigenform is said to be normalized when scaled so that the q-coefficient in its Fourier series is one: :f = a_0 + q + \\\\sum_{i=2}^\\\\infty a_i q^i where q = e2œÄiz.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  History Hudson was established in 1802 and named in honor of its founder, David Hudson, who led a settlement party from Goshen, Connecticut, to Connecticut's Western Reserve. This area of land had been part of the State of Connecticut during the colonial era, and even after Connecticut gave up its claims to western lands of the United States, it retained a portion of northeastern Ohio known as the Connecticut Western Reserve. Noted for its prominent role in the early settlement of northeast Ohio, the Village of Hudson retains much of its New England heritage. Centered by a town green, the town contains outstanding examples of Greek Revival architecture with some regional adaptations. High style examples of Victorian architecture are also found in Hudson. When the Ohio and Erie Canal started operations through Peninsula, Hudson started to grow and flourish as the canal brought trade, industry and development to the region. Through the efforts of David Hudson, the Western Reserve College was established in 1826 and acquired the reputation of being ‚Äúthe Yale of the West.‚Äù Now a private preparatory school, Western Reserve Academy built an early observatory (1838), one of the first built in North America. Master builders Lemuel Porter and his son Simeon worked extensively in Hudson during the early 19th century. Many of their buildings bear a distinctive detail‚Äîa truss of wheat fanlight surround. This semi-elliptical element, mimicking cut wheat being held in the middle and dropping down on the ends, is found on the fa√ßade of the Bliss House (1831) which faces the town green. The Brewster Mansion, 1853, is an unusual Moorish influenced building that also fronts the green. After the Civil War, the town prospered with the arrival of railroad related commerce, but many citizens in Hudson over-speculated in the railroads and were financially ruined. In 1882 the college moved to Cleveland and a devastating fire (rumored as the result of a bar fight in the Lockhart Saloon, now Kepner's Tavern) in 1892 destroyed Hudson's downtown area. Salvation for Hudson arrived in the form of returning son James W. Ellsworth.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History Located immediately northwest of downtown Akron, the Cascade Locks Historic District is a ravine that opens up to a flat plane where the Ohio and Erie Canal empties into the Little Cuyahoga River. This area of the canal included the steepest grade of the entire 304 miles between Lake Erie to the Ohio River. The district was the site of many industrial operations during the 19th and early 20th centuries, fueled by the abundant hydraulic power created by the steep descent of the runoff from the parallel Crosby's Mill Race. Along with providing an industrial power source, canal operations provided ample time and traffic for commerce. With each lock, canal traffic stopped. There were 21 locks in the Akron area, and it took boats six hours to get through the two miles of canal. A popular establishment for canallers was located in the Cascade Locks area. Though it originally functioned as a cigar box plant with its own mill race, the Mustill Store was best known as a ‚Äúswilling place‚Äù across from Lock 15. The 1913 flood brought an end to the canal. Several locks were dynamited to prevent inundating the downtown area. The most damaged area of the canal included the cascade locks. The canal commission determined the system was not salvageable. Water from the Summit Lake is controlled by ODNR by a dam/gate system at Lock 1 to prevent the disaster that happened in 1913. From there, it flows unimpeded over the locks and into the Little Cuyahoga River. There are many varied buildings and sites within the district including the Mustill Store‚Äînow a visitor center and canal museum. The district also includes the site of the original mills of Ferdinand Schumacher‚Äîfounder of Quaker Oats; two railroad bridges spanning the gorge; a steam plant and two rubber factories; numerous lock and waste way ruins. A footpath currently runs alongside the locks. The Ohio and Erie Canal towpath hike/bike trail is complete throughout the Cascade Lock Park and a bridge connect the trail from Harvard Avenue in Cuyahoga County to the Southern Boundary of urban Akron in Summit County.

It originated from over 2800 years ago. The Estonian horse has influenced several Baltic horse breeds, including the Tori horse. The breed is strong and is resistant against sickness. The breed is nowadays most common in Estonia.  Characteristics  The Estonian horse is rather small, measuring at the withers. It is strong, yet not heavily built. The most common colourations are black, bay, chestnut, and grey. The breed is a tireless and powerful puller, and is well suited to agricultural work with its easy temperament. This has contributed for the breed's use as a children's riding horse, a major reason for why the breed was able to survive. Most breeders let their herds live under natural pasture conditions except during wintertime, and the breed lives well on forage alone. This has made the breed healthy and durable with hard feet. Their appearance is not exceptional. The head is small with straight profile and primitive facial features. The breed is willing and easy to handle, inexpensive to keep, and often long-lived. The breed is nowadays used for tourist rides. Finland has a breed association for the Estonian Horse.  History  The Estonian Horse is descended from the primitive forest horse that lived in the Northern Europe more than 5,000 years ago, and is considered the progenitor of other breeds such as the North Swedish Horse and the Dole Gudbrandsdal. The Estonian Horse has retained its qualities and looks due to little influence by other horse breeds. However, it is believed that the breed became mixed with the now extinct √ñland Horse, as large numbers of √ñland Horses were exported to Estonia at one point. Tests authorised by associations dedicated to the √ñland Horse have revealed that these two breeds have a genetically similar background. During the 11th century, a traveler known as Adam of Bremen considered the Estonians to be rich with gold and good horses. The breed became popular throughout the Baltic countries for its strength and suitability for farm work. Horses of the breed were sold to Russia as early as in the 14th and 15th centuries. they were also imported to Sweden for the needs of the military. Development of agriculture resulted in good working horses becoming even more desirable, and many Estonian Horses were crossbred with heavier draft horses to create stronger animals. The first documents concerning attempts to improve the Estonian Horse are from the founding of the Tori stud in 1856. The breed was then crossbred with lighter working horse and riding horse breeds. The best offspring resulting from these attempts became the foundation of the Tori horse. One of the most successful sires, Vansikasa, was foaled at the stud. He became well known for his exceptional strength, pulling skill and indomitability, and one of his daughters was the founding mare of the Tori Horse. Even the Vyatka horse was influenced by the Estonian Horse. After the First World War a breeding program was created to help preserve the breed whose numbers had fallen quite a lot during the war. \\"Estonian Native Horse Breeders Society\\" and an Estonian Horse studbook were founded in 1921. By 1937, only 13 stallions had been used, and the Estonian horse was becoming inbred due to the scarcity of strains. This led to horses reaching maturity later, and slowed down the development of the breed. With the mechanisation of transport and agriculture, horses became obsolete and the breed nearly died out, excluding the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. With a few animals left on the mainland, the breed was eventually revived with the help of a new breeding program, and the breed's population has now reached circa 1000 animals in Estonia. The breed has recently been crossbred with Finnhorses to enhance its size, but both of these breeds are descended from the Forest Horse. In 1992 the association started anew after having been down for the 1980s. In 2000, an association was founded to preserve the breed. In 2005, 25 animals of the breed were imported to Sweden to recreate the genetically closely related, extinct √ñland Horse. The new √ñland horse is not called that, however, but the \\"Estonian Bush Pony\\".√ñlandsh√§st, √§ven Estnisk buskponny , accessed 2011-01-24  See also  *Tori (horse) *Finnhorse *North Swedish Horse * Estonian Draft  Notes   References  * Den estniska h√§sten * Fakta om den estniska h√§sten * Estnisk h√§st hos Breeds of Livestock Category:Horse breeds Category:Horse breeds originating in Estonia ","title":"Estonian horse"},{"id":"30613897","text":"Institute of Design and Construction (IDC), was a non-profit technical college, now defunct, located in Brooklyn, NY.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History Glendale Cemetery was founded in 1839 by Dr. J.D. Commons. Here statues of prominent citizens, an avenue of stately mausoleums and a collection of headstones tell the story of Akron's past. Originally known as Akron Rural Cemetery, Commons modeled the design of the cemetery after Boston's Mount Auburn Cemetery, which he visited in 1838. Glendale is a picturesque romantic landscape with its curving roads, use of promontories to create vistas and a variety of architectural styles that draw upon ancient building forms. Mausoleums are modeled after Egyptian, Greek and Roman temples or Gothic churches. Nineteenth-century accounts described Glendale as ‚Äúbeautifully laid out in romantic drives and walks‚Äù and note its role as an area park and tourist destination. Originally, the cemetery had a stream and two bodies of water‚ÄîWillow and Swan Lakes. Due to the increased development surrounding the cemetery during the late 19th century, the natural spring that fed the lakes dried up. The superintendent of the cemetery at that time proposed running a pipe to the Ohio and Erie Canal to re-water the lakes, but this was never realized. Today the open space or Great Meadow recalls the scale of Swan Lake and several mausoleums have small foot bridges that once crossed over the stream fronting them. Distinct sections of the cemetery are devoted to the Masons, Akron's Jewish community and infants and children. The Civil War is prominently commemorated in Glendale Cemetery. The Buckley Post of the Union Army has a large memorial marker surrounded by 50 headstones located on the northern plateau. The 1876 Gothic Revival style Memorial Chapel was constructed by the Buckley Post and has been recently restored. Notable interments * Ohio Columbus Barber, industrialist and philanthropist.

Initially released in Japan by Parabolica Records in October 2010, the album was released in the rest of the world on clenchedwrench, an independent record label newly founded by Watt. He is accompanied on the album by his Mike Watt + The Missingmen bandmates, guitarist Tom Watson and drummer Raul Morales. Writing and recording The album is a loose concept album (Watt refers to it as his third \\"punk opera\\") of thirty short songs, all two minutes or under (most average about a minute and a half) inspired by creatures from the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch; each of the thirty song titles is derived from a nickname Watt came up with for each creature, \\"since I don't know three-hundred-year-old Dutch\\". According to Watt, the album \\"is quite different\\" from his previous punk operas Contemplating the Engine Room and The Secondman's Middle Stand \\"in that it has no standard narrative... meaning no regular beginning-middle-end.\\" Another inspiration woven into the album's lyrics was taken from \\"the idea of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz kind of tripping on what men do to 'be' men.\\" Musically, Watt was inspired to write short songs again after re-immersing himself in the back catalog of his first band, The Minutemen prior to and in the course of filming the documentary We Jam Econo. Watt had seen a parallel between the album's initial concept and The Minutemen in \\"how many little trips could roll up into one big one.\\" Inspired by his earlier music Watt still wanted to take into account the changes in his life saying \\"I would write lyrics dealing with myself as a middle-aged punk rocker, which is something the Minutemen never dealt with really.\\" The music to all thirty songs was written by Watt on one of Watt's late friend and Minutemen bandmate D. Boon's Fender Telecasters. The guitar and drum tracks were recorded in three days in May 2009 during a planned break in a tour Watt undertook with the Missingmen, at Studio G in Brooklyn, New York, the studio of ex-Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone. Watson and Morales recorded their parts without the benefit of having heard the bass line or vocals first. Watt overdubbed his vocals and bass parts thirteen months later.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History The Main‚ÄìMarket Street Historic District is the heart of the North Village of Akron's original town plat, created in August 1833. Developed to the north of the canal town of Akron, and eventually merged into one city, this area of Akron has long been a successful commercial center. The intersection of Main and Market is now a primary gateway into downtown Akron. The district reflects Akron's late 19th and early 20th century economic boom from the milling and rubber industries. Buildings of note in the district include the Old Akron Post Office, an Italian Renaissance Revival building constructed in 1899 designed by James Knox Taylor. The brick building design is dominated by several large limestone trimmed archways and has a very low slope hip roof. No longer serving as a post office, the building is now the Akron Art Museum. One of the most dominant buildings in the district is the United Building, built by the United Cigar Store Company in 1924 at a cost of one million dollars. Designed in the Neo-Classical style, the building has the vertical orientation of a classical column, with the corner elevations clearly divided into separate base, shaft and capital sections. The Northern Ohio Traction and Light Company building was constructed in the Beaux Arts style. Clad in white glazed terra cotta, the six-story building features colossal composite piers, arondel ornamented frieze and a Greek key sill course. The Carnegie Library is a buff sandstone building also designed in the style of Beaux Arts Classicism. The highly sculptural two-story building was designed by architect Frank O. Weary who designed several other prominent Akron buildings during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most notably the Glendale Cemetery Memorial Chapel. The Commerce Block-Hermes Building Building was constructed in 1870, but its Neo-classical stone ashlar fa√ßade now reflects the changes the district went through from the late 19th to the early 20th century. The elevation facing Maiden Lane Alley includes paired windows with round arch drip molding, reflecting its commercial Italianate origin. One of the first important cultural buildings, the Everett Building, was completed in 1871. Constructed in the Second Empire style with local sandstone and brick, the building housed a performance hall, offices and retail space. After an 1897 fire, owner S.T. Everett renovated the building and added two additional stories, making it primarily offices, although the Akron Public Library occupied the second story.

Margaret O'Brien had been a member of the Radio √âireann Choral Society, where she preferred to sing in Irish. Loughran had spent some years in Scotland where he had absorbed Scottish folk music. The following year Dubliner Jim McCann took the place of Paddy Roche. In July 1965 they had a hit with \\"The Butcher Boy\\" (a variation of \\"Died for Love\\") and also recorded \\"Yesterday's Dream\\". By this time they were touring Ireland and Britain and appearing on TV and radio. In 1966 they were the first Irish folk group to have a no. 1 hit, which was Dominic Behan's \\"The Sea Around Us\\", which remained at the top spot for four weeks. They followed this up with a satirical composition of their own, \\"Johnny Lad\\". In that year they also performed two songs for the Irish National Song Contest, one of which, \\"The Wind Through the Rafters\\" came second and entered the Irish hit parade. They recorded an album, The Wind and the Sea, with Pye Records. By 1967 Gerry Cairns had replaced Sean Loughran. The group broke up at the end of 1967.

However, the research regarding appointed U.S. senators and the incumbency advantage is not nearly as vast. In this research, the relationship between the number of months served as an appointed U.S. senator and the percentage of vote that appointed senator receives in their initial election is studied. It is hypothesized that the longer an appointee has served before an election, the higher percentage of vote that appointee will receive. To do this, data was compiled from the United States congressional archives consisting of appointed U.S. senators, the percentage of vote those appointed senators won in their election after their appointment, as well as the number of months served between their appointment and election. Discovering a relationship between months served and the vote percentages received will add to the scholarship of incumbency, and more specifically, how the discipline of political science views appointed U.S. senators. Review of literature Conventional wisdom in the political science community tells us that the largest advantage a U.S. senator has is that of incumbency. This advantage has even been distilled down to a single term: the \\"incumbency advantage\\". However, as well studied as the incumbency advantage is of those U.S. senators who are elected, there exists some mystery for those U.S. senators that are appointed. This review will summarize and explain research on the incumbency advantage and its limitations, and how these studies assist in answering questions regarding appointed U.S. senators and incumbency. Five research studies have been chosen to examine the incumbency advantage. First, David R. Mayhew‚Äôs Congressional Elections: The Case of the Vanishing Marginals, which will establish a base of the study of incumbency. Following that research, the review will further focus its lens with two articles authored by Peter Tuckel, titled Length of Incumbency And the Reelection chances of U.S. Senators and The Initial Re-Election Chances of Appointed & Elected United States Senators, respectively. Finally, Treadmill to Oblivion: The Fate of Appointed Senators, which is authored by William D. Morris and Rodger H. Marz, and The Electoral (Mis)Fortunes of Appointed Senators and the Source of the Incumbency Advantage, written by Jennifer A. Steen and Jonathan Koppell will close out the review. =Mayhew= In Mayhew's Congressional Elections: The Case of the Vanishing Marginals, Mayhew compiled House seat swing data between the years of 1956 to 1972 . In his research, he explained, \\"The House seat swing is a phenomenon of fast declining amplitude and therefore of fast declining significance.\\" Mayhew asks whether House members are getting more of a benefit from federal programs. Mayhew notes, \\"The number of grant-in-aid programs has risen in the last decade‚Ä¶\\" Mayhew also posits that House members have become more skilled at taking positions on issues, arguing that this is possibly due to an increase in polling technology and resources. Mayhew's study appropriately relates to the research question by explaining how incumbency becomes an advantage. Mayhew's research gives an introduction to a prominent hypothesis regarding the incumbency advantage: that experience and time served are some of the most important characteristics of an incumbency advantage =Tuckel= Peter Tuckel examines the pattern of incumbency in his research, Length of Incumbency and the Reelection Chances of U.S. Senators and The Initial Re-Election Chances of Appointed & Elected United States Senators. In his studies, Tuckel examined the relationship between the length of incumbency for appointed U.S. senators and found that \\"only 24 percent of appointed senators are retained in office compared to 65.4 percent of the elected senators.\\" Even when removing appointed incumbents who relinquish their role voluntarily, Tuckel notes that only ‚Äú56.5 percent of appointees win on election day compared to 76 percent of elected office holders.\\" Upon doing so, Tuckel concludes that \\"(Appointed Senators) are considerably less successful in gaining re-election than are the specially- elected incumbents‚Ä¶Moreover, appointed senators who serve for twelve months or less actually do better than those who serve between thirteen and twenty-six months.\\" Tuckel suggests that the reason for the difference in electoral chances for appointed senators compared to incumbent senators is the amount of experience present in the two. Tuckel's research provides useful information regarding the question of the incumbency advantage with appointed U.S. senators. His research allows for a more focused research question examining the relationship between length served and election rate for appointed senators. =Morris and Marz= William D. Morris and Roger H. Marz's Treadmill to Oblivion: The Fate of Appointed Senators is a thorough and in- depth review of the careers of appointed senators, an issue brought up by Peter Tuckel in his research, The Initial Reelection Chances of Appointed & Elected United States Senators. Throughout their research, Morris and Marz bring to attention some interesting questions. The authors argue the concept of \\"illegitimacy,\\" a disposition that voters experience towards senators that are appointed. Morris and Marz write, \\"the survival rate of appointed senators who seek to hold their seats suggests the voting public considers them \\"illegitimate\\" in the social psychological sense.\\" The authors go on to argue that this \\"suggests the mantle of office protecting \\"normal\\" incumbents does not fully cover the appointee.\\" Morris and Marz also analyze the relationship between the political backgrounds that appointees have and their reelection rate. In their analysis, an interesting statistic arises: out of the seventeen private citizens that have been appointed to the United States Senate, eight chose to not to seek reelection, while nine chose to. Of those nine that ran, none won their reelection. Furthermore, Morris and Marz discover that ‚ÄúIn 81 percent of the cases where an appointed incumbent was defeated, the opposition candidate has a higher status of previous political experience.‚Äù The authors conclude that the senate appointees cannot establish a vibrant reelection effort while being bogged down with committee work and the \\"norms of conduct and courtesy which apply to all newcomers‚Ä¶The appointee, then, is given very little opportunity to perform those services so basic to reelectability during the first session of Congress. In addition, \\"the appointee returns home to find himself locked in political combat with a far more experienced opponent.\\" Morris and Marz's research presents some possible explanations for a lower than typical appointee election rate, adding to a list of additional independent variables regarding the research question. =Steen and Koppell= In Jennifer A. Steen and Jonathan Koppell's research titled, The Electoral (Mis)Fortunes of Appointed Senators and the Source of Incumbency Advantage, the authors attempt to \\"disentangle the power of holding office from the advantages that are accrued through or are indicated by winning office in the first place.\\" Steen and Koppell hypothesize that there are two factors to the incumbency advantage that are overlooked. First, \\"that incumbents attain re- election because of qualities they possessed before they became incumbents.\\" Next, the authors argue that an incumbent gains certain qualities by his or her own candidacy, and that the incumbent is given the ability to hone and tend to the skills and connections needed to be successful. Essentially, Steen and Koppell are arguing that holding the office doesn't have as much to do with the incumbency advantage as previously thought, but \\"rather the political resources accrued during the previous election and the electoral strength indicated by the initial victory contribute significantly to the re-election success of incumbents.\\" Paying homage to Morris and Marz, Steen and Koppell also suggest, regarding appointed senators and their reelection rates that \\"It could be that the undemocratic nature of these senators' election is actually a disadvantage when the candidate must go before the electorate.\\" Steen and Koppell's research is the most current, and is a great reference in answering the research question. The authors' data was the most current of any of the authors reviewed, and allows for a more thorough sifting of data. David Mayhew's research offered a foundation for incumbency, as Peter Tuckel introduced the incumbency advantage to the United States Senate, and offered explanatory suggestions of possible alternatives to the advantages gained by simply becoming a U.S. senator. William Morris and Roger Marz analyze differences in political experience between appointed senators and their challengers, the complications of running a reelection effort an appointed senator would face. Finally, Jennifer Steen and Jonathan Koppell argue that incumbency is more about the candidate and his or her skills, than about the advantages obtained in office, channeling Tuckel.

Lutzka explained in 2014 that he \\"grew up on skates,\\" and first tried ice skating at the age of two before playing ice hockey in high school. Lutzka commenced skateboarding at the age of nine after discovering it through his peers in the ice hockey team. Skateboarding was initially an activity that he enjoyed as an aside to ice hockey, but three years later, Lutzka replaced ice hockey with skateboarding because he \\"loved it so much.\\" Professional skateboarding Lutzka was first sponsored at the age of 15 and he explained in 2014 that, upon attaining sponsorship, he realized that professional skateboarding was a feasible option for him. Volcom and Oakley were two of the brands that supported Lutzka, while he was connected with established skateboarders like Rodney Mullen and Tony Hawk. Lutzka relocated to California, U.S., at the request of his sponsors. Lutzka was one of the original team members of the Almost skateboard deck brand that was cofounded by Mullen and Daewon Song. Luztka is a former team member of the Globe shoe company team and released one signature shoe model with the brand, named the \\"Culprit\\" (also released in a \\"high-top\\" model, whereby the length of the shoe is extended to cover the lower shin). A full-length Lutzka video part appears in the United By Fate series of short episodic films that were released by Globe between 2007 and 2009‚ÄîLutzka's part, edited to the Justice song \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\", is the feature section of the fourth episode. Following the completion of his contract with Globe, Lutzka negotiated a skate shoe contract with tennis shoe company K-Swiss in 2009 and, as of August 2012, continues to develop the company's skateboard area. In an August 2012 interview with the internet-based Jenkem publication, Lutzka explained: > They‚Äôre building up the program but the economy kind of took a hit right now > so like every company is cutting back. Actually I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre > cutting back that much as they are just taking time to think about the > decisions we make. My shoe is pretty much done it just comes down to when > they want to release it. In addition to changing shoe sponsors, Lutzka left Almost to join the Darkstar company (both brands are part of the same distribution house, Dwindle Distribution). Lutzka explained his decision to change sponsors in an interview with Poweredge Magazine: > Now it‚Äôs [Almost] just a lot different than it was then; it‚Äôs just a > different program now than when I was on there. When I was on there it was > me [Ryan] Sheckler and Torey Pudwill.

An August 12, 2014, edition of Thrasher Magazine's \\"Skateline\\" program announced that Lutzka had parted ways with K-Swiss and joined the Osiris Shoes company. While an official announcement from either Osiris or K-Swiss was not published, the Osiris blog first featured Lutzka on June 22, 2014. In a September 2014 interview, Lutzka offered advice to young skateboarders: > Skateboarding is all about having fun and having fun with your friends; it‚Äôs > always been that way, and it‚Äôll always be that way.

Personal life  Lutzka resides in Mission Viejo, California, US. He moved there in 2004, after living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his mother Lori, father, Jeff, and brother Andy. He explained in 2014 that he enjoys snowboarding and playing guitar when he is not skateboarding. Lutzka concluded his 2014 interview with the statement: \\"I want to continue to be a good role model.

They may have been an Iroquoian-speaking tribe; most of the Iroquoian peoples were located further north around the Great Lakes. Other Iroquoian-speaking tribes in what is present-day Virginia were the Nottoway and Meherrin. The much larger Cherokee people, historically located further west and south in the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Deep South, still speak their Iroquoian language. Early English colonial records noted encounters with a few men who said they were survivors of a massacre of the Senedo, committed by the powerful Catawba, their traditional enemy, between 1650 and 1700. Based in the Carolina Piedmont, the Catawba were a Siouan-speaking people and had a different culture. They competed over the fur trade, game, and other resources. In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, rebels named Shenandoah County after the former native people of the area. The county had formerly been named for the Royal Governor Lord Dunmore.

It is the most basal known member of the Parvicursorinae. The genus gets its name from Linhe, a city near the site where the fossil was first found and Greek nykus, \\"claw\\". The specific name is derived from Greek monos, \\"single\\", and daktylos, \\"finger\\", a reference to the fact that it is the only known non-avian dinosaur to have had but a single digit. Description Reconstruction Linhenykus was small-bodied, being only a few feet in length. Femur length is . Alvarezsauroids are known for their short forelimbs, each with a single greatly enlarged second digit. Although alvarezsaurids were once thought to have only a single digit on each forelimb, more recent evidence has shown that most species have reduced third and fourth digits. Linhenykus is the first known alvarezsaurid to have only a single, second digit. Although a reduced third metacarpal is present, the phalanges or finger bones of the third digit was entirely lost. The fourth metacarpal is not preserved in the Linhenykus holotype, but given that digit III is a reduced structure lacking phalanges, it is probable that this metacarpal is entirely absent in Linhenykus. Despite having the most reduced digits of any alvarezsauroid, Linhenykus was shown by cladistic analysis to have been a basal form as is indicated by the fact that its enlarged digit is not as large or robust as with more advanced forms. Some scientists have suggested Linhenykus, like other alvarezsaurids, was insectivorous, using its claws to dig into ant and termite nests, similar to modern anteaters.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/linhenykus-a-weird- one-fingered-dinosaur-92765780/> Discovery The fossil of Linhenykus was collected by Jonah N. Choiniere and Michael Pittman from the Late Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation of Nei Mongol (Inner Mongolia), China. Biostratigraphic and lithographic correlations suggest that the formation dates to the Campanian stage, 84-75 Ma. Linhenykus is currently known from a partial skeleton, holotype IVPP V17608, including cervical, dorsal, sacral and caudal vertebrae, forelimb, hindlimbs, and pelvis, and a referred complete pes (anatomy). The genus was first described and named in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Xu Xing, Corwin Sullivan, Pittman, Choiniere, David Hone, Paul Upchurch, Tan Qingwei, Xiao Dong, Lin Tan and Han Fenglu in 2011. In 2013, an osteological monograph of the genus was published which included a quantitative analysis of alvarezsauroid biogeography. The latter found statistically significant biogeographic reconstructions suggesting a dominant role for sympatric (or ‚Äòwithin area‚Äô) events, combined with a mix of vicariance, dispersal and regional extinction. It has been suggested that Linhenykus may be a junior synonym of Parvicursor, but this interpretation was rejected by the original authors and has not been adopted in subsequent research on alvarezsauroids.

Career  Little Joe is of Mexican descent. Hern√°ndez told the Stockton Record in 2015 that he was born \\"in a three-wall, dirt-floor garage on a cold stormy night,\\" the seventh of 13 children. His father, Salvador, was known as \\"La Cotorra\\" (the parakeet) and was a troubadour. His mother, Amelia DeLeon, was a trained pianist. \\"My dad and aunts all played instruments and sang,\\" he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise (Nov. 18, 2015). We'd go to parties that would last until three in the morning. Hern√°ndez got his start at 13 when his cousin, David Coronado, recruited him to play guitar for his Latinaires. The Latinaires eventually became known as Little Joe and the Latinaires. Today he is usually joined by his band La Familia. In 1992, their album 16 de Septiembre earned the Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. In 2008, Little Joe once again won a Grammy for Best Tejano Album of the year for Before the Next Teardrop Falls. Other Grammy nominated albums include Timeless (1988), 1993's Que Paso (1993), Little Joe y La Familia 2000 (1999), and Celebration of Life Vol.1 & Vol.2 (2003). Hern√°ndez has said he was greatly influenced by Beto Villa, the originator of orquesta Tejana that generally features trumpets and saxophones, as opposed to conjunto, which relies on accordions. As a member of Texas‚Äô Tejano Hall of Fame, he‚Äôs been entertaining audiences around the world for more than 50 years, on 70 albums and in countless shows. His style has been called Tejano, Tex-Mex, Norteno, Chicano, La Onda.

The tunnels are long, cutting through Wheeling Hill, and each carries two lanes of Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250. The tunnels originally took three years to construct, costing $6.9 million. Reconstruction of the tunnel, originally planned to take a total of 6 months, took over three years to complete between 2007 and 2010, at a cost of $13.7 million. Overview The Wheeling Tunnel sits between exits 1A and 1B on Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250, which run concurrent through the city of Wheeling. The tunnel cuts through Wheeling Hill, and has two travel lanes in each tube. Due to the closeness of exit 1A to the western end of the tunnels, the tunnels' right lanes function as acceleration and deceleration lanes. Through traffic is restricted to the left lane in each tunnel and lane changes are prohibited. A series of accidents involving semi-trailer trucks prompted local political candidates to push for trucks to be banned from the tunnel, diverting them to the nearby I-470. Construction The twin tunnels, which cost $6.9 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to construct, are lined with a total of of industrial tile. Then governor William Wallace Barron, and the state roads commissioner broke ground on the tunnel on August 22, 1963, which he stated was the largest single construction project in the state's Interstate Highway program. The construction contract was awarded to C.J. Langenfelder & Son, Inc. located in Baltimore, Maryland. Several workers became ill after being exposed to high amounts of carbon monoxide fumes, which brought construction to a halt in 1964 until ventilation fans were installed. The tunnel officially opened to traffic on December 7, 1966. Renovations An overview of Wheeling Hill Plans for the reconstruction of the tunnel were formed in 2005, with reconstruction work beginning in January 2007. Reconstruction of the tunnel was planned to take 3 months, but reconstruction of the eastbound tunnel, which was not totally completed, took over eleven months. After the issues with the reconstruction work, local politicians suggested closing the tunnels altogether, and to just build the freeway over Wheeling Hill, however after opposition from the NAACP and other groups, the suggestions were dropped. Completion of the eastbound tunnel reconstruction begin in July 2008, when the tiles were replaced for the first time with new tiles fabricated by a German tile manufacturer. The Division of Highways had to award the contract to the German company because no other company could complete the request within the time frame required. The original tiles were made by a now-defunct company based in Cleveland. During the second round of eastbound tunnel reconstruction, the westbound tunnel was also closed overnight for construction work. The eastbound tunnel reconstruction was completed on October 31, 2008. The westbound tube was closed in February 2010, and opened a month ahead of schedule in September 2010. The total cost of the project was over double the original bid, totaling $13.7 million, due to the delays.

This tribe is a group of polyphagous moths that reside mostly in the tropical regions of Afro-Eurasia but also North America. Description Within the family, Lymantriini is distinguished from other tribes by dark, usually zig-zag (sometimes crescent-shaped) banding on the forewings, V-shaped marks on the wing as well as a discal spot and an orbicular spot. It is also characterized by the lack of an areola. Lymantriini generally are not particularly native to any one area, being found in both the Nearctic and Palearctic zones. Taxonomy The tribe was originally described by entomologist Douglas C. Ferguson as one of two tribes (the other Orgyiini). A 2006 paper by J.D. Holloway distinguished three new tribes from Lymantriini -- Nygmiini, Leucomini and Arctornithini. In doing this, Holloway acknowledges that Lymantriini is \\"possibly the most weakly defined of those presented here ... [it] lacks all the strongly definitive features of the other tribes.\\" The genus Lymantria (H√ºbner) is the most prominent member of the tribe. Genera The tribe includes the following genera.

By disallowing computers from accessing specified sites and by screening for newsgroups likely to contain sexually explicit material, SurfWatch was able to aid parents, educators and employers in preventing access to offensive material from a specific computer. The Apple Macintosh version of SurfWatch 1.0 was developed starting in 1994, first shipped to the public in May 1995, and was followed by the Microsoft version in July of the same year.Surfwatch company fact sheet, 2005. Due to its specific locus of control, SurfWatch and various similar software programs played an instrumental role in helping to overturn the Communications Decency Act, as they offered an alternative to internet censorship. Because Surfwatch gave users a choice as to what should be blocked, it offered an alternative to broad censorship of online material.‚ÄúSurfWatch plays crucial role in overturning communications decency act‚Äù, June 12, 1996, accessed January 20, 2011. Surfwatch has been criticized by Peacefire for unfairly blocking gay and lesbian resource sites.‚ÄúSurfwatch examined‚Äù, accessed January 20, 2011. Founders Surfwatch was founded by Ann Duvall, Bill Duvall, and Jay Friedland. Ann Duvall, President of SurfWatch software had performed a wide variety of roles in high-tech prior to her involvement with SurfWatch. Bill Duvall, CEO of Surfwatch, had been previously involved in founding and developing technology companies for 30 years. In the course of his work, he gained the distinction of writing the software which sent the first package across the Internet in 1969. He coauthored RFC‚Äôs 1, 2 and 3. Bill is featured in a video on the 40th anniversary of the Internet.Computer History Museum: Happy 40th Birthday to a Radical Idea! Since their work on SurfWatch, Bill Duvall and Ann Duvall have gone on to create ‚ÄúChoosetheBlue.com,‚Äù a website that provided information as to which companies had employees that primarily supported democratic candidates and which companies had employees who primarily supported republican candidates. The site was intended to encourage consumers to spend money in places that would support democratic causes.Skalka, Jennifer.‚ÄúBlue voters now urged to buy blue‚Äù, ‚ÄúChicago tribune‚Äù,December 14, 2004, accessed January 20, 2011. Jay Friedland, who acted as Vice President of Marketing and Sales had 15 years of experience in high-tech management at the time of SurfWatch's creation. He has since gone on to assist Internet start-up companies in establishing new business models for commerce on the net. Currently, he works as Vice President of Strategy and Sustainability for Zero Motorcycles and as Legislative Director for Plug In America. Software in Court In 1995, the U.S. Senate set out to ban Internet users from posting illicit content. In the measure, the Senate endorsed ‚Äúsevere penalties‚Äù for those who posted ‚Äúeverything from child pornography to profanity.‚Äù Despite the seeming impossibility of accurate enforcement, the measure outraged many American citizens. Those who opposed the measure believed that censorship of the Internet was an infringement on their right to free speech. Opponents of the Congressional legislation believed that technology that blocks access is preferable to an outright ban.Markoff, John. ‚ÄúInternet software developer in acquisition‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe New York Times‚Äù, April 24, 1996, accessed January 20, 2011. At the time of the legislation, SurfWatch was one of the only companies offering an Internet filter. A majority of the technology industry believed the best way to shield children from inappropriate content was, as journalist Steve Lohr put it, ‚Äúwith specialized software, enabling parents to block access to certain computer-network traffic.‚ÄùLohr, Steve. ‚ÄúSenate bill escalates computer smut debate‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe New York Times‚Äù, June 16, 1995, accessed January 20, 2011. Thus, as an alternative to complete Internet censorship, software such as SurfWatch played a key role in the overturning of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, for it provided Internet users to limit access controlled audiences, rather than limiting the whole of Internet content to all.

Ransom Dunn, D.D. (July 7, 1818 ‚Äì November 9, 1900) (nickname: \\"the Grand Old Man of Hillsdale\\") was an American minister and theologian, prominent in the early Free Will Baptist movement in New England. He was President of Rio Grande College in Ohio, and Hillsdale College in Michigan. A Discourse on the Freedom of the Will is one of his most notable works. Early years Dunn was born in the town of Bakersfield, in the north corner of Vermont to John (died 1835) and Abigail Reed Dunn (died 1858), a family of English and Scots descent. Three brothers, Hiram, Lewis, and Thomas, also became ministers; there were at least two older half-brothers, Joab and John.Gates (1901), p. 31 He had at least one sister, Amanda Dunn Montague.Gates (1901), p. 18 Around 1840 Dunn attended the Baptist Seminary (later named Cobb Divinity School at Bates College) in New Hampton, New Hampshire. In 1873 he received an honorary doctorate from Bates College in Maine, which was then affiliated with the seminary.General catalogue of Bates college and Cobb divinity school, 1863‚Äì1915 By Bates College. Lewiston, Me, Cobb Divinity School. Lewiston, Me Career Hillsdale College photo from, A consecrated life, a sketch of the life and labors of Rev. Ransom Dunn, D.D., 1818‚Äì1900 On the third Sabbath in August, 1837, Ransom Dunn, at the request of the Lenox church, was ordained to the gospel ministry. Among his most important pastorates were in the cities of Dover, New Hampshire, Great Falls, New Hampshire, New York City, and Boston, Massachusetts. By 1843, he was recording secretary of the Home Mission Society. In 1849, he began preaching at the Stuyvesant Institute in New York City. He became a pastor of the Free Will Baptist Church of Boston. He is known for his publication A Discourse on the Freedom of the Will, published in 1850. With John Jay Butler, he published Lectures on systematic theology: embracing the existence and attributes of God, the authority and doctrine of the scriptures, the polllinstitutions and ordinances of the gospel in 1892. Dunn once mused, \\"The real value of colleges and universities is not to be estimated by the magnitude of buildings or endowments, but by the increase of mental power and moral force.\\" Dunn taught at Geauga Seminary (where he taught future president James Garfield and First Lady Lucretia Garfield), and he was a professor at Central Michigan College in Spring Arbor, MI, which later moved and was renamed Hillsdale College. He was the first President (1876‚Äì1879) as well as professor of mental and moral philosophy at Rio Grande College. He was later the president of Hillsdale College, Michigan, its dean, Burr professor of Christian Theology, and professor emeritus of moral theology. Dunn secured the school's original financial support by riding on horseback for thousands of miles through the frontier lands of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin in the early 1850s, gathering donations. In Minneapolis in 1882, at the 25th General Conference of the Free-will Baptist Church, Dunn was chosen to be the moderator. Personal life In 1838, he met a relative of Ethan Allen, Mary Eliza Allen (died 1848), and they married in Ohio soon thereafter.Gates (1901), pp. 62‚Äì3 They had three children. Sons Newell Ransom Dunn (1841‚Äì1863) and Francis Wayland Dunn (Wayne, Ohio 1843‚Äì1874) both served in the Civil War. The youngest was a daughter, Cedelia Dunn (1845‚Äì1858). In September 1849, he married Cyrena A. Emery (1824‚Äì1896) in Dover, New Hampshire;Gates (1901), p. 90 and they lived in Boston. They had at least three children, daughters, S. Abbie Dunn Slayton, Helen (\\"Nellie\\") Dunn Gates, and Nettie Dunn. Daughter Helen was the author of A consecrated life, a sketch of the life and labors of Rev. Ransom Dunn, D. D., 1818‚Äì1900.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrat 18 *Labour 16 *Conservative 12 *Liberal 1 *Independent 1 Election result The results saw the Liberal Democrats become the largest party on the council with 18 seats, but without a majority, after making 3 gains. They gained the seats of Coxford and Millbrook from Liberal party councillors who had previously left the Liberal Democrats, and the seat of Woolston from Labour. This was the first time the Liberal Democrats, or their predecessors the Liberal Party, had been the largest party in Southampton for over 90 years. Labour were reduced to 16 seats after losing another seat in Sholing to the Conservatives who went up to 12 seats. The Liberal party defeats reduced them to only 1 seat, while 1 independent who was not up for re-election remained. Overall turnout was up by only 0.8% from 2002 at 29%, despite all voters having the option to vote by post. Following the election, discussions were held in order to decide who would be to take control of the council, with Labour trying to remain in control and the Liberal Democrats to take over. The Conservatives refused to support either of the other groups, meaning that the Liberal and independent councillors held the balance, as Labour's Parvin Damani had a potential casting vote as mayor.

Founded in 2002 in the runup to the Iraq War, Win Without War remains active as a coalition of national, multi-issue organizations dedicated to advancing progressive national security solutions. The coalition comprises 37 national organizations including MoveOn.org, CREDO Action, the Council for a Livable World, and the NAACP. Win Without War is a program of the Center for International Policy. History Win Without War was founded in 2002 in opposition to the impending American invasion of Iraq. Original coalition members included the National Council of Churches, Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, Move On, the National Organization for Women, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Rainbow/PUSH, Sojourners, Women's Action for New Directions, and Working Assets. Its founding co-chairs were former Congressman and general secretary of the National Council of Churches Bob Edgar, and former executive director of Women‚Äôs Action for New Directions Susan Shaer. Edgar was later replaced as co-chair by David Cortright, Director of Policy Studies at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame. The original goal of the coalition was to oppose a preemptive war in Iraq while still allowing for weapons inspections and monitoring to prevent Iraq from obtaining weapons of mass destruction. In a launch press conference, coalition co-chair Bob Edgar noted that the group believed that preemptive war with Iraq would be detrimental to America, noting: \\"We believe that a preemptive military invasion of Iraq will harm American national interests. Unprovoked war will increase human suffering, arouse animosity toward our country, increase the likelihood of terrorist attacks, damage the economy and undermine our moral standing in the world. It will make us less, not more, secure.\\" The coalition was previously run by former US Representative Thomas Andrews (D-ME), and its current director is Stephen Miles. Issues Since the invasion of Iraq Win Without War has continued to advocate against US military intervention abroad and has developed campaigns around the core issues of reducing American militarism and upholding and protecting the rule of law in national security and foreign policy. Related issues have included the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention center and the reduction of wasteful US military spending. Opposition to US use of force in Syria In 2014 Win Without War opposed the US military intervention on the Syrian Civil War on the grounds that it would be ineffective and cause civilian suffering. The coalition crafted a plan for alternatives to bombing to end the conflict in Syria. This plan called for financial sanctions, the disruption of supply lines, the addressing of local grievances, and an increase in humanitarian assistance. Win Without War continues to oppose US military intervention in Syria while promoting a negotiated settlement that brings the quickest possible end to hostilities. Support of the Iran Nuclear Deal In 2015 Win Without War was a vocal public supporter of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. Coalition efforts helped generate more than 1.8 million petition signatures and more than 1 million emails to members of Congress in support of the deal.

All five crew and 29 of the 30 passengers were killed. The aircraft also carried the RAF serial number XF629 allotted to this aircraft for use during trooping flights only.ABC Civil Aircraft Markings log 1955 Accident At 21:14 the Viking took off from Blackbushe Airport on an unscheduled passenger flight to RAF Idris in Libya. The aircraft on charter to the War Office had five crew, 25 soldiers from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, one soldier's wife, two children and two war department civilians. At 21:16 the pilot reported I have port engine failure, I am making a left-hand circuit to come in again. As the aircraft turned onto the approach to land, while still about 1200 yards (1,116 m) from the runway, the aircraft crashed into a wooded copse at Star Hill. Thirty-four of the 35 on board were killed. Aftermath The aircraft exploded and burst into flames when it hit the ground about 50 yards (46 m) from the A30 road. Passing lorry drivers were the first to help. Ambulances and six fire tenders from the airport were quickly on the scene. The airport fire tenders were soon joined by others from Surrey, Berkshire, Hampshire and United States Navy personnel temporarily based at Blackbushe. The 29 bodies were recovered and four survivors were taken to Cambridge Military Hospital in Aldershot. Three of those in hospital subsequently died leaving only one survivor. Investigation A coroner's inquest was held at Aldershot on 5 June 1957 which returned a verdict of accidental death on the 34 who died. A public inquiry was opened in London on 23 July 1957. The inquiry report was published in November 1957 and determined that the loss was caused by an error of skill and judgement by the pilot. The report noted that although Captain Jones had flown over 6,800 hours of which 4,800 had been with the Viking he had not made a single-engined landing for at least two years. Because of the fire it was not possible to determine if the port engine had failed. Probable cause The probable cause was the failure of the captain to maintain a safe altitude and airspeed when approaching to land on one engine after failure (or suspected failure) of the port engine.

Known only from a single tooth, an upper first or second molar, it is among the few known fossil treeshrews. With a length of 3.57 mm, the tooth is large for a treeshrew. At the back lingual corner (the side of the tongue), the tooth shows a small cusp, the hypocone, that is separated from the protocone in front of it by a narrow valley. The condition of the hypocone distinguishes this species from various other treeshrews. In addition, the presence of a well-developed but simple mesostyle (a small cuspule) is distinctive. Taxonomy Tupaia miocenica was described in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and L√©onard Ginsburg in a report on the fossil mammals of Li Mae Long, a Miocene site in Thailand.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 804 The animal is known from a single tooth, which according to Mein and Ginsburg's comparisons most closely resembles the living treeshrews of the genus Tupaia.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, pp. 804‚Äì805 The specific name, miocenica, refers to the animal's occurrence during the Miocene. Only a few other fossil treeshrews are known, and T. miocenica is the only fossil species from Thailand.Sargis, 2004, pp. 56‚Äì57 When it was described, it was the only Miocene representative of Tupaia, but a second species, Tupaia storchi, was named from the Late Miocene of Lufeng, China, in 2012.Ni and Qiu, 2012 Description The single known tooth, a worn left upper molar known as T Li 175, is large for a treeshrew, with a length of 3.57 mm and width of 4.79 mm. Although Mein and Ginsburg described it a second upper molar (M2), Ni and Qiu argued in 2012 that it is more likely a first upper molar (M1).Ni and Qiu, 2012, p. 58 It is dilambdodont (with a W-shaped chewing surface) and the labial surface (the side of the cheeks) is concave and bears a cingular crest. A well-developed small cusp, a mesostyle, is present on the labial side. The presence of the mesostyle distinguishes the animal from Ptilocercus, the only member of the treeshrew family Ptilocercidae.Helgen, 2005, p. 108 The lingual (tongue) side is narrow. A large cusp, the protocone, is on the front lingual corner. Two crests descend from it; one reaches the paracone on the front labial side and another approaches the metacone to the back of the tooth. A smaller cusp, a hypocone, is on the back lingual corner. This feature distinguishes T. miocenica both from the treeshrew genera Dendrogale, Prodendrogale, and Palaeotupaia, which lack the cusp entirely, and from Anathana and Urogale, which have a large hypocone. In T. miocenica the back and lingual sides of the hypocone are straight and form a right angle with each other. The tooth most closely resembles Tupaia species with a simple mesostyle, such as the common treeshrew (Tupaia glis). However, this species is smaller and unlike in T. miocenica, the hypocone is not isolated from the protocone by a narrow valley. Range and ecology Li Mae Long, the collection site of T. miocenica, is dated to the latest Early Miocene, corresponding to the European zone MN 4, around 18 mya.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 783 It is in the Thai province of Lamphun. The fossil fauna encompasses 34 species of mammals,Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, pp. 784‚Äì785 including the tarsier Hesperotarsius thailandicus, the rodent Diatomys liensis, the slow loris ? Nycticebus linglom, and the metatherian Siamoperadectes. Mein and Ginsburg conclude that the fauna represents a tropical forest environment close to a shallow lake.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 784 References Literature cited *Helgen, K.M. 2005.

A Hanafi jurist and mufti, he was also an authority on shari'ah, hadith, Qur'anic exegesis, and Sufism. Born in Deoband, British India, he graduated in 1917 from Darul Uloom Deoband, where he later taught hadith and held the post of Chief Mufti. He resigned from the school in 1943 to devote his time to the Pakistan Movement. After the independence he moved to Pakistan, where he established Darul Uloom Karachi in 1951. Of his written works, his best-known is Ma'ariful Qur'an, a commentary on the Qur'an. Birth and early childhood Muhammad Shafi, son of Muhammad Yasin, was born on 25 January 1897 (21 Sha'ban 1314 AH) in Deoband, British India, to an Usmani family. Translated by Zameelur Rahman from introduction to He was given the name \\"Muhammad Shafi\\" () by his father's sheikh, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, though he was originally named \\"Muhammad Mubin\\" () by his grandfather, Khalifah Tahsin Ali. Shafi grew up in a religious environment. As a child he played in the courtyard of Darul Uloom Deoband and sat in the company of his father, who was a teacher at the school. Education Aged five, Shafi began memorising the Qur'an with Muhammad Azim and Namdar Khan at the Darul Uloom. In 1907 or 1908 (1325 AH), he commenced the study of Urdu, Persian, mathematics and other subjects at Darul Uloom Deoband, which he completed within the next five years under the supervision of his father. He studied arithmetic and Euclid from his uncle Munshi Manzur Ahmad and Quranic recitation from Muhammad Yusuf Miruthi. Along with teaching Shafi the Persian books, Maulana Yasin also instructed him in the elementary Arabic books of sarf (morphology), nahw (grammar), and fiqh (jurisprudence), up to Fusul-i Akbari, Hidayat an-Nahw, and Munyat al-Musalli. In 1330 AH (1912) or 1331 AH (1913) Shafi was formally enrolled in the upper level Arabic classes of Darul Uloom Deoband. He did Daurah Hadith in 1335 AH (1916/1917) under the supervision of Anwar Shah Kashmiri, and completed his education in 1336 AH (1917/1918). The teachers under whom Shafi formally studied included: *Anwar Shah Kashmiri *Shabbir Ahmad Usmani *Azizur Rahman Usmani *Mian Asghar Hussain Deobandi *Izaz Ali Amrohi *Muhammad Rasul Khan *Muhammad Ibrahim Balliyawi *Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi *Hafiz Muhammad Ahmad Among his teachers was Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who was the school's head teacher. Some of the books Shafi studied with him were Sahih al-Bukhari, Jami' at-Tirmidhi (with the exception of a small part), at-Tirmidhi's Shama'il and 'Ilal, al-Falsafah al-'Arabiyah on modern philosophy, and Sharh an-Nafisi on medicine (tibb). Shafi was among Kashmiri's closest students, and Kashmiri would later select Shafi for assistance in refuting the Ahmadiyya Movement. Shafi studied Sahih Muslim and half of Hidayah with Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, whom he would later accompany in the movement to create Pakistan. With Mian Asghar Hussain Deobandi he studied the hadith collections Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan an-Nasa'i, and the remainder of Jami' at-Tirmidhi. With Azizur Rahman, head of the Darul Uloom's Fatwa Department, Shafi studied the Muwatta of Imam Malik in the transmission of Yahya ibn Yahya and the transmission of ash-Shaybani, at-Tahawi's Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar, Tafsir al-Jalalayn, Mishkat al-Masabih, Ibn Hajar's Sharh Nukhbat al-Fikar, and Hisn-i Hasin. He studied Sunan Ibn Majah with Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi. With Izaz Ali Amrohi he studied all the books of literature, Maibazi's Sharh Hidayat al-Hikmah, at-Taftazani's Sharh al-'Aqa'id al- Nasafiyah, Ubayd Allah al-Mahbubi's Sharh al-Wiqayah, and some other treatises. With Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim he studied Sadra and Shams al- Bazighah. After Daurah a few books still remained, including Qazi, Mir Zahid, and Umur-i 'Ammah‚Äîthese were completed in 1336 AH (1917/1918). In that year Shafi was also appointed to teach some lessons. Career Shafi began teaching at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1918 or 1919 (1337 AH). He taught the elementary level books of the curriculum and eventually reached the level of Daurah Hadith. The first book of Daurah level that he was given was Muwatta Imam Malik, and he later taught other books. In 1354 AH (1935/1936) he was entrusted with teaching Sunan Abu Dawud for some time in place of Maulana Asghar Husain. On Husain's request he was given this lecture permanently, and he taught it until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in 1943 (1362 AH). Shafi was regarded as an exceptional lecturer on many subjects, but two of his lessons were most famous‚Äîone was Sunan Abu Dawud, and the other was Maqamat al-Hariri in Arabic literature. After leaving Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught Sahih al- Bukhari for three months at Jamiah Islamiyah Dabhel, filling in for Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani. Shafi established Darul Uloom Karachi in 1951 (Shawwal 1370 AH). There he taught Sahih al-Bukhari for several years, as well as Muwatta Malik and Shama'il at-Tirmidhi. Whenever due to health or other responsibilities he was unable to teach the whole of Bukhari, then those years he would teach until the Book of Wudu, and other teachers would cover the remainder. In the last four years of his life, he was bedridden and thus unable to teach regularly. However, on the insistence of students and teachers, every year he taught the first lesson of Sahih al-Bukhari and the last lessons of the Sihah Sittah. Fatawa , Rulings  Shafi frequently assisted Azizur Rahman Usmani, head of the school's fatwa department. Azizur Rahman resigned from the Darul Uloom in 1344 AH (1925/1926). Others occupied the post of Sadr Mufti (Chief Mufti) until the Majlis-e-Shura of Darul Uloom Deoband appointed Shafi to the post on 28 Rabi al-Awwal 1350 AH (c. 13 August 1931). In additions to undertaking the duties of fatwa-writing, Shafi also continued to teach some books of hadith and tafsir. In November 1932 (Rajab 1351), Shafi published a tract entitled Nihayat al-arab fi ghayat an-nasab on caste. The weavers of the Deoband area (who were regarded as a lower caste) revolted against the fatwa, and from early 1353 AH (1934/1935) to late 1354 AH (1935/1936) rallies were held and threats were made against Shafi, in response to which a group of teachers took to acting as his bodyguards. Several scholars wrote or spoke in defense of the fatwa, including Shafi's shaikh Ashraf Ali Thanawi, Sayyid Asghar Husain, and Husain Ahmad Madani. Due to the controversy, Shafi asked to be transferred to the teaching department, a request that was eventually granted by the Majlis-e-Shura in Sha'ban 1354 AH (c. November 1935). Shafi remained in the teaching department over the next few years, during which two other ulama held the post of Sadr Mufti. On 25 Safar 1359 AH (c. 4 April 1940), Shafi was appointed to the office a second time. He held the post until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in Rabi al-Awwal 1362 AH (March 1943). Estimates of the number of fatwas that he issued while at Darul Uloom Deoband range from 26,000 to over 40,000. Some of Muhammad Shafi's fatwas have been published in eight large volumes titled Imdad al-Muftin, while the majority remain unpublished. Tasawuf From an early age, Shafi frequently attended the gatherings of Mahmud Hasan Deobandi. Then when Mahmud Hasan was imprisoned in Malta, Shafi consulted Ashraf Ali Thanawi. Mahmud Hasan returned to Deoband in June 1920 (20 Ramadan 1338 AH). In 1339 AH (1920) Shafi gave bay'at (allegiance) at his hand. However, Mahmud Hasan died a few months later on 18 Rabi al-awwal AH (November 1920). Shafi returned to Thanawi after Mahmud Hasan's death. In Rabi ath-thani 1349 AH (1930) he received ijazat-i bay'at (permission to take disciples) and khilafah (spiritual successorship). Pakistan Movement When the All-India Muslim League was formed to campaign for the creation of a separate Muslim state, Ashraf Ali Thanvi instructed all Muslims, including scholars, to support this campaign. Shafi and other scholars, including Zafar Ahmad Usmani, joined the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a council of Islamic scholars formed by Shabbir Ahmad Usmani to campaign for the creation of Pakistan. In 1363 AH (1944) Muhammad Shafi resigned from teaching and issuing fatwas at Darul Uloom Deoband in order to devote his time to the movement for the creation of Pakistan. He toured India, gave speeches, and issued fatwas for this purpose. Migration to Pakistan In 1948 (1367 AH), after the partition of India, Shafi migrated from Deoband to Pakistan. He founded Darul Uloom Karachi in 1370 AH (1950/1951). He died on 10 Shawwal 1396 (6 October 1976).  Life in Pakistan  He remarked that the various educational systems that came into being under the British rule ‚Äì traditional Madrasahs, spearheaded by Deoband, and modern schools, spearheaded by Aligarh ‚Äì should be integrated thus balancing the religious and worldly dimensions of knowledge and nurturing. He avoided disputes at all costs and on occasion, he even gave up land allocated to him by the government of Pakistan to build a Madrasah, just to avoid a dispute that has arisen in the process. Works He wrote around one hundred books explaining the Quran and interpreting Islamic law. His best-known and most widely translated work is the Ma'ariful Qur'an (\\"The Wisdom of the Quran\\"), which he finished (in Urdu) four years before his death.Ma'ariful Qur'an: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Qur'an (Karachi: Mataba-e-Darul-Ulomm Karachi, 2008 ed.), Volume 1. p. xv This work, a commentary on the entire Quran, began as a series of weekly lectures on Radio Pakistan that ran for ten years.

Biography Morrell was an American prisoner who became known for withstanding cruelty and torture. He was accomplice to the Evans and Sontag gang that robbed the Southern Pacific Railroad in California's San Joaquin Valley in the 1890s. According to his memoir, \\"The 25th Man\\", the robberies were after revenge for the large railroad corporation's mistreatment of local ranchers of the San Joaquin Valley. Morrell was sentenced to life imprisonment in Folsom State Prison in 1894. He was eventually transferred to San Quentin (1899 at the latest), and pardoned in 1908. Five of his years were spent in solitary confinement;\\"Five Years in the Solitary Dungeon\\", by Jack Jungmeyer, The San Francisco Sunday Call, February 14, 1909. he was known as the Dungeon Man of San Quentin. Author Jack London championed his pardon and Morrell became a frequent guest at London's Beauty Ranch in Glen Ellen, California. London used Morrell as a character in his 1915 novel The Star Rover.The Star Rover was adapted for the 1920 film of the same name, and the 2005 film The Jacket, thus indirectly preserving Morrell on celluloid. Morrell had been subjected to severe physical abuse in prison. After his release, he lectured widely on his experiences and advocated prison reform.For example, \\"Ed Morrell's Act Is Too Realistic\\", The San Francisco Call, June 24, 1912. He lectured with former San Quentin prisoner and author, Donald Lowrie.Lowrie, Donald. My Life Out of Prison (1915). Morrell's lectures included addresses to the California and Pennsylvania legislatures. He advocated the abolition of corporal punishment. In 1914, he wrote a one-act play, The Incorrigible, based on his experiences (and one of his nicknames). In 1924, he published his memoirs, The 25th Man: The Strange Story of Ed. Morrell, the Hero of Jack London's Star Rover. Morrell was born in Thomaston, Pennsylvania on October 22, 1868. He came to California in 1891. \\"In his later years, he was a colorful habitue of Gower Gulch and a frequenter of Hollywood and Vine, the crony and pet of Hollywood film people.\\" He died, age 78, in Los Angeles on November 10, 1946.\\"Last Railroad-Raiding Bandit, Ed Morrell, Dies,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 12, 1946.Sifakis, Carl.

The bird pecks through the cactus skin, then excavates downward to hollow out a space for its nest. When the saguaro dies, its soft flesh rots, but its woody infrastructure lasts much longer. So does the hollowed-out callus whose roughly boot-like shape gives it the name of \\"saguaro boot.\\" Several different kinds of birds create nest holes in saguaro cactus. The Gila woodpecker (Melanerpes uropygialis) creates small holes (about 5 cm across) at midlevel on the cactus, where the ribs are far apart, feeding on larvae under the cactus skin. The larger gilded flicker (Colaptes chrysoides) drills bigger holes higher up, where ribs are close together, because its beak is strong enough to break through rib tissue. The saguaro responds to the bird's damaging its tissue by secreting a resinous sap that, over time, hardens into a bark-like shell that prevents the cactus from losing fluid and also protects the nest hole by making it waterproof. The bird's nesting hole requires not only the bird's making a hole but also the cactus's lining the hole - it is not ready for use as a nest until a year after its creation. Many saguaros are home to multiple nests; if birds excavate adjoining hollows, a saguaro boot may be formed with more than one opening. Native Americans of the Seri group used saguaro boots to store or carry water. It is now illegal to collect saguaro boots from the wild in Arizona. Some desert moth caterpillars also make tunnels inside saguaro cactus. The resulting dried callus that forms around their tunnels has a flattened disk structure where the caterpillar exits instead of the larger hole seen on a saguaro boot.

The electorate was won by Terry McCombs of the New Zealand Labour Party, succeeding his mother. Selection process Terrence McCombs's mother, Elizabeth McCombs had held the seat after winning it in a by-election in 1933. She died on 7 June 1935 after succumbing to illness. The New Zealand Labour Party chose Terrence McCombs to stand for them. This was in some ways a surprise as many expected that Jim Thorn would be the candidate. The United-Reform Coalition who were operating under the name \\"National Political Federation\\" selected Melville Lyons as their candidate. Lyons had a rural background as he was secretary of the New Zealand Sheepbreeders' Association at the time. In the 1925 New Zealand general election he had stood for the New Zealand Reform Party in 1925 in Lyttelton against James McCombs. He was declared the winner with a victory of eight votes but the election court overturned this and McCombs won by just one vote. The New Zealand Democrat Party's leader Albert Davy declined to stand a candidate in the by-election. He believed that the by-election was a waste of money given the close proximity to the 1935 general election. Other candidates who chose to stand included Edward Hills and G.S Hamilton. Results Results of the by-election held on 13 September 1933 were: Results of the by-election held on 24 July 1935 were: Outcome McCombs extended his majority to 2,645 at the general election later that year and held the seat until 1951.

Research interests Czeisler‚Äôs research focus is the neurobiology of human circadian rhythm. He examines the relationship between the circadian oscillator and sleep homeostasis, and how this interaction affects health.\\"Annual Sleep in American Poll Exploring Connections with Communications Technology Use and Sleep\\". National Sleep Foundation. March 7, 2011.Joseph S. Takahashi, Hee-Kyung Hong, Caroline H. Ko & Erin L. McDearmon \\"The genetics of mammalian circadian order and disorder: implications for physiology and disease\\" Nature Reviews Genetics 9, 764-775 (October 2008) Czeisler's research interests encompass many areas including body temperature rhythms and the effects of melatonin on humans (2011). Czeisler investigates how the physiological system works to reset the circadian pacemaker. His team discovered that light transduced by non-visual input (melanopsin activation) could reset the circadian clock in patients without sight. This indicated that some blind humans can entrain to light through non-visual photoreceptors (2007). Czeisler found that intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) influence both the circadian clock and visual perception, indicating that ipRGCs contribute to ‚Äúvisual‚Äù light perception even in the absence of rod and cone photoreceptors. Significantly, this challenged the misconception that rod and cone photoreceptors were the sole receptors for photo-entrainment in humans. In 2002, Czeisler published a study that defended the long-held notion that mammals do not have extra-occular photoreceptors. The findings of his study definitively refute those of the famous 1998 Science publication, ‚ÄúExtraocular Circadian Phototransduction in Humans,‚Äù which found that bright light behind the knees can help regulated human circadian photoentrainment. Czeisler has examined the effects of sleep deprivation on the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms, and how this impacts attention performance. He found that bright light duration impacts the circadian pacemaker, melatonin suppression, and sleepiness. He has also discovered that even room lighting can suppress melatonin production and its duration. Czeisler has also dedicated a portion of his career to examining the effects of light timing, duration, intensity, and wavelength on resetting the pacemaker through ipRGCs, which contain the photopigment melanopsin. Czeisler‚Äôs work has many important applications. He showed that sleep deprivation could have adverse consequences affecting obesity and diabetes, among other health problems. He has also investigated the effects of chronic sleep deprivation and restriction, night shifts, and circadian disruption, on neurobehavioral performance and metabolism. Furthermore, Czeisler studied how sleep deprivation impairs the psychomotor performance of night shift workers (2009-2014), specifically surgeons (2009-2013) and residents (2010), police officers (2004-2008),\\"Sleep disorders linked to poor health and reduced occupational performance in police officers\\". National Sleep Foundation. Jan 3, 2012 and truck drivers (2012). Other research interests of his include studying wakefulness, sleep deprivation and how it can be prevented, and such influences on the clock as exercise and age. Czeisler‚Äôs research has be applied to medicine, space travel, and night occupations including shift-work. =Summary of selected contributions= * 1990 ‚Äì Human circadian clock is highly light sensitive.Strogatz, Steven H. \\"Interpreting the Human Phase Response Curve to Multiple Bright-Light Exposures.\\" Journal of Biological Rhythms.

Understanding the internal circadian period makes problems dealing with jet- lag, night shifts, and sleep schedules in orbit more approachable Guided by the significant real-life implications of his research, Czeisler is a strong advocate for healthy sleep habits.

According to Czeisler, sleep deficit poses a significant individual and public health hazard as demonstrated by the significant contribution of drowsiness to workplace accidents and motor vehicle accidents. In an interview with the Harvard Business Review, he explains that companies should seek to address this problem by setting behavioral expectations and scheduling policies for employees to avoid accruing sleep deficit.Czeisler, Charles. \\"Sleep Deficit: The Performance Killer A Conversation with Charles A.

Burman, S.D. Burman, and Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal. In the 21st century, Singh became known for his 1983 album Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat, which has been described as pioneering the electronic dance style later known as acid house. It received re-release in 2010 on the Bombay Connection label. Biography Singh led a wedding band and recorded and released a number of albums covering popular film songs. These were a form of instrumental elevator music, some of which have since been re-released by Sublime Frequencies, such as his steel guitar renditions of \\"Manje Re\\" from Bandhe Haath in 1973 and \\"Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne\\" from Yaadon Ki Baaraat in 1975. In 1981, he produced synthesizer-based electronic renditions of the Silsila soundtrack in his record Charanjit Singh: Plays Hit Tunes on Synthesizer of Silsila. Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat, an album of original electronic disco compositions Singh recorded in 1982, was a commercial failure at the time of its original release, but its re-discovery in 2002 and re-issue in early 2010 garnered attention due to comparisons with acid house from the mid to late 1980s. Since then, certain commentators in the music press have recast Singh as an originator of acid house music. He also used the same drum machine and synthesizers for his experimental electronic calypso record, Experiments in Calypso. His son Raju Singh is a composer, who has scored for films and television shows. Charanjit Singh died of cardiac arrest in his sleep during the midnight of 4 July 2015 at his home in Bandra, Mumbai.http://www.huffingtonpost.in/suprateek- chatterjee/rip-charanjit-singh-the-m_b_7750646.html?1436343715 Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat In the 21st century, Charanjit Singh gained attention for his 1982 release Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat, an album originally intended as a fusion of electronic disco music with Indian classical ragas. Singh's use of both the TR-808 drum machine and TB-303 bass synthesizer has led some music journalists to suggest that it is perhaps the earliest example of acid house music; predating Phuture's seminal Chicago acid house record \\"Acid Tracks\\" (1987) by five years. Comparisons have also been made with the work of other electronic dance musicians who were inspired by acid house such as Ceephax, Phuture 303, and Aphex Twin. According to The Guardian writer Stuart Aitken, Singh's record was \\"far ahead\\" of its time. Aitken also discussed the importance of the record on US radio station PRI's The World. =Production= Singh produced Ten Ragas using three electronic musical instruments made by the Roland Corporation: the Jupiter-8 synthesizer, Roland TR-808, and Roland TB-303. It was one of the first records to use the TB-303, a machine that has become synonymous with acid house. Singh had bought his TB-303 in Singapore soon after its introduction in late 1981. He didn't know much about the three machines at first, so he spent much time in figuring out how to use them, and eventually discovered that it was possible to synchronise the TR-808 and TB-303 with the Jupiter-8 keyboard. According to Singh: \\"At home I practised with the combination and I thought 'It sounds good ‚Äì why not record it'.\\" While the TB-303 was originally designed to fill in for a bass guitar, it was awkward when it came to reproducing conventional basslines, so he found a different way to employ the machine, particularly its glissando function which made it suitable for reproducing the Indian raga melodies. Besides Indian raga music, he also took inspiration from contemporary Bollywood music, or filmi music, specifically the Indian electronic disco scene that had only just become popular in the early 1980s (sparked by the success of Pakistani pop singer Nazia Hassan and Indian producer Biddu), at a time when disco's popularity had declined in the United States. In parallel to the Euro disco scene at the time, the continued relevance of disco in India and the increasing reliance on synthesizers led to experiments in minimalist, high-tempo, electronic disco, such as R.D. Burman's \\"Dil Lena Khel Hai Dildar Ka\\" (Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai, 1981) which had a \\"futuristic electro feel\\" and Bappi Lahari's \\"Yaad Aa Raha Hai\\" (Disco Dancer, 1982). Such developments eventually culminated in the work of Singh, who increased the tempo and made the sounds more minimalistic, while pairing them with instrumental Indian ragas using his new equipment setup. According to Singh: \\"There was lots of disco music in films back in 1982. So I thought why not do something different using disco music only. I got an idea to play all the Indian ragas and give the beat a disco beat ‚Äì and turn off the tabla. And I did it. And it turned out good.\\" The first track \\"Raga Bhairavi\\" also features a synthesised voice that says \\"Om Namah Shivaya\\" through a vocoder. =Release= The album was released under the label Gramophone Company of India (1983 LP) (now Sa Re Ga Ma), having been recorded at their HMV Studio in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1982. (2010 CD) Following the LP record's release in 1982, it garnered some interest in India, finding its way onto Indian national radio, but it became a commercial failure and was largely forgotten until recent years. However, Singh may have played a role in popularising electronic music in Bollywood at the time, and a somewhat similar \\"techno-sounding interlude\\" had later appeared in Lahiri's song \\"Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki\\" from the film of the same name in 1984. =Live performance= From 2012 until his death in 2015, Singh performed the material from Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat live. =Track listing= Both the original 1982 and 1983 LP records and the 2010 CD and LP (2010 LP) re-releases contain the following five-minute-long tracks named after ragas: #\\"Raga Bhairavi\\" ‚Äì 4:59 #\\"Raga Lalit\\" ‚Äì 4:55 #\\"Raga Bhupali\\" ‚Äì 4:53 #\\"Raga Todi\\" ‚Äì 4:52 #\\"Raga Madhuvanti\\" ‚Äì 4:59 #\\"Raga Meghmalhar\\" ‚Äì 5:01 #\\"Raga Yaman\\" ‚Äì 5:06 #\\"Raga Kalavati\\" ‚Äì 5:08 #\\"Raga Malkauns\\" ‚Äì 5:02 #\\"Raga Bairagi\\" ‚Äì 5:07 See also *Goa trance *House music *Indi-pop *Music of India *Psychedelic music *Raga rock References External links Category:Musicians from Mumbai Category:Indian male classical musicians Category:Acid house musicians Category:House musicians Category:Disco musicians Category:Techno musicians Category:2015 deaths Category:1940 births Category:20th-century Indian musicians Category:20th- century male musicians ","title":"Charanjit Singh (musician)"},{"id":"30616758","text":"Superkatt is an American \\"funny animal\\" comic book series by Dan Gordon (under the comics pen name \\"Dang\\"), a jab at the ‚Äúlong-underwear‚Äù genre of superhero comics.

The South Korean operator of the vessel, the Samho Shipping Company, was facing huge losses because it was obligated to continue paying Norwegian investors under its charter even while the vessel was held by pirates. However, the Norwegian government had no military presence in the area at the time. Eight South Koreans were among the 21 crewmembers being held hostage. The South Korean government dispatched Choe Yeong, under Captain Cho Young- joo, commander of the Cheonghae Anti-piracy Unit. Choe Yeong pursued Samho Jewelry for nearly a week until the pirates aboard the tanker were fatigued. Several fake attacks were staged to exhaust the pirate crew. When some of the pirates left the ship to attempt another hijacking on a nearby Mongolian vessel, commandos from the Republic of Korea Naval Special Warfare Brigade boarded Samho Jewelry while a Westland Lynx helicopter provided covering fire.

Choe Yeong escorted Samho Jewelry to Oman, where they docked at the port of Muscat on 31 January. The rescue was called \\"a perfect military operation\\" by Lieutenant General Lee Sung-ho of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Republic of Korea. =2011 Libya evacuation= ROKS Choe Yeong was diverted from anti-piracy operations in the waters off of Somalia to evacuate South Korean nationals stranded in Libya. Choe Yeong successfully evacuated 32 South Korean nationals on 4 March and docked in the Maltese port of Valletta. Choe Yeong remained on standby near Libyan waters to support \\"further evacuation efforts.\\" =2019 Jinhae Accident= ROKS Choe Yeong returned from a tour of duty with the Cheonghae Anti-piracy Unit on May 24, 2019. The ship was participating in a welcoming ceremony in the Jinhae Naval Base in Jinhae. While tightening a mooring line around 10:15 am KST, the rope snapped for currently unknown reasons. A petty officer second class died while receiving treatment, while four other sailors received non-life threatening injuries.

It was an amulet (amuletum) with the magical function that, according to one of the oldest sources (Liber Juratus), allowed the initiated magician to have power over all creatures except Archangels, but usually only reserved for those who can achieve the blessed vision of God and angels (beatific visionary). Middle Ages =Liber Juratus= Probably the oldest known description and image of the Sigillum Dei is the 14th Century Liber Juratus (also Liber Sacratus, Liber sacer sive Juratus, or Sworn Booke),G√∂sta Hedeg√•rd: Liber Juratus Honorii: A Critical Edition of the Latin Version of Sworn Book of Honorius, Institutionen for Klassiska Spr√•k, Stockholm 2002 (= Acta Universitatis Stockholmiensis, Studia Latina Stockholmiensia, 48); vgl. auch Jean Patrice Boudet: Magie th√©urgique, ang√©ologie, et vision b√©atifique dans le Liber sacratus sive Juratus attribu√© √† Honorius de Th√®bes, in M√©langes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome Moyen-√Çge 114,2 (2002), S. 851-890, Text S. 871-890; nur mit Vorsicht zu gebrauchen sind die englischen Ausgaben von Daniel J.

This may have been produced in the late 13th century, but likely not before the time of Pope John XXII. (1316‚Äì1334).Jean Patrice Boudet,Magic th√©urgique ... (2002), p. 858f. The description of the seal in the Liber Juratus begins with the dimensions of the circle surrounding the outside in relation to common symbol figures of the Christian tradition. > make first a circle whose diameter is three fingers, because of the three > cross-nails of the Lord, or five fingers because of the five wounds of > Christ, or seven for the seven sacraments, or nine for the nine orders of > angels, but usually five fingers will suffice.

Next to the circular band is a pentagram, which focuses on a Greek Tau, this is surrounded by the five letters of the name of God \\"El\\" and \\"Ely\\", and five other pairs of letters (lx, al, a, c, to). Inside the pentagon, in turn, is a heptagon drawn in such a way that its top side touches the centre tip of the pentagram, and the pages of this heptagon should be labelled with the names of seven angels and archangels (Cafziel, Satquiel, Amael, Raphael, Anael, Michael, Gabriel). From this first heptagon is a second and a third drawing, whose description is hard to understand and has been interpreted differently in the manuscript illustrations, but has usually seven key points with crosses and labelled with two rows of Gods: a first series of seven names of God, each in three syllables or components disassembled and relating spatially with those on the initial and final syllables of the last names of angels and vertices of the figure, namely la-ya- ly (to Cafziel), na- ra-th (to Satquiel), ly-bar-re (to Raphael), ly-ba-res (to Michael), (e) t-ly- alg (to Samael), ve -h-am (to Anael), and y-al-gal (to Gabriel); also in sub- segments seven more: Vos, Duynas, Gyram, Gram, Aysaram, Alpha and Omega, a third series El, On, El, On, Electric, On, Omega; as additions to the registered crosses the four letters a, g, a, l; and finally another group of five names of God Ely, Eloy, Christ, and Sother Adonay. The colour of the seal of the Liber Juratus indicates that the pentagram is usually red, purple with yellow faces, the first heptagon blue, second yellow, the third yellow and the black circles, and also the area between the circles and all other surfaces were to turn green. In magical operations, this would be handled differently ‚Äì instead drawn on virgin parchment with the blood of the mole, pigeon, hoopoe, bat or other animals, such as cattle, horses or deer. =Clavicula Salomonis= Different versions of the Sigillum Dei are known from the tradition of the Clavicula Salomonis, specifically from an Italian manuscript in the collection of Heimann Joseph Michael in the Bodleian Library (MS. Michael 276); and John Aubrey in 1674 made a copy, also in the Bodleian Library (MS. Aubrey 24). Early modern One of the oldest surviving manuscripts of the Liber Juratus, dating from the end of the 14th or the beginning of the 15th century, is manuscript No. 313 from the collection of Hans Sloane in the British Museum. It was partly owned by the mathematician and magical experimenter John Dee, in whose Mysteriorum Libri Quinti, or Five books of mystical exercises (1581‚Äì1583), the Sigillum Dei played a central role and gained the suffix Sigillum Dei: Emeth or Aemeth (\\"Truth\\").John Dee's Conversations with Angels: Cabala, Alchemy, and the End of Nature, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc. 1999, p. 35ff. For John Dee, who received the authoritative description of the seal in 1582 via his medium and employee Edward Kelley, this scholarly and antiquarian interest was ultimately subordinate to the purpose of practical application. This can be contrasted with Athanasius Kircher, who devoted a detailed explanation to the Sigillum Dei in his Oedipus aegyptiacus,Athanasius Kircher: Oedipi Aegyptiaci Tomi secundi Pars AlteraVitale Mascardo, Rome 1653, Class. IX (Magia Hieroglyphica), cap. VIII ram,.

Career In the early 1950s, Kurzman worked in Europe and in Israel for American newspapers and news agencies, thereafter becoming correspondent of the NBC News in Jerusalem.

In 1965 he received the George Polk Award for external reporting. He left the Washington Post and focused on researching and writing Modern History, especially military history non-fiction. In 1980 he received the Cornelius Ryan Award. A Polish-Israeli research team have suggested that much of what Kurzman wrote about the Warsaw Ghetto was actually tainted by the personal testimony of unreliable Polish witnesses most notably Henryk Iwanski, who deliberately magnified their own role in wartime Warsaw. Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum suggest that Kurzman accepted the account of Iwanski who presented himself as hero, uncritically, and that Iwanski's testimony should be treated as confabulation.Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum, Bohaterowie, hochsztaplerzy, opisywacze.

The term is related to and may be analogous to depth buffer, Z-buffer, Z-buffering and Z-depth.Computer Arts / 3D World Glossary, Document retrieved 26 January 2011. The \\"Z\\" in these latter terms relates to a convention that the central axis of view of a camera is in the direction of the camera's Z axis, and not to the absolute Z axis of a scene.  Examples  File:Cubic Structure.jpgCubic Structure File:Cubic Frame Stucture and Floor Depth Map.jpgDepth Map: Nearer is darker File:Cubic Structure and Floor Depth Map with Front and Back Delimitation.jpgDepth Map: Nearer the Focal Plane is darker Two different depth maps can be seen here, together with the original model from which they are derived. The first depth map shows luminance in proportion to the distance from the camera. Nearer surfaces are darker; further surfaces are lighter. The second depth map shows luminance in relation to the distances from a nominal focal plane. Surfaces closer to the focal plane are darker; surfaces further from the focal plane are lighter, (both closer to and also further away from the viewpoint).  Uses  Fog effect Shallow depth of field effect Depth maps have a number of uses, including: * Simulating the effect of uniformly dense semi-transparent media within a scene - such as fog, smoke or large volumes of water. * Simulating shallow depths of field - where some parts of a scene appear to be out of focus. Depth maps can be used to selectively blur an image to varying degrees. A shallow depth of field can be a characteristic of macro photography and so the technique may form a part of the process of miniature faking. * Z-buffering and z-culling, techniques which can be used to make the rendering of 3D scenes more efficient. They can be used to identify objects hidden from view and which may therefore be ignored for some rendering purposes. This is particularly important in real time applications such as computer games, where a fast succession of completed renders must be available in time to be displayed at a regular and fixed rate. * Shadow mapping - part of one process used to create shadows cast by illumination in 3D computer graphics. In this use, the depth maps are calculated from the perspective of the lights, not the viewer. * To provide the distance information needed to create and generate autostereograms and in other related applications intended to create the illusion of 3D viewing through stereoscopy . * Subsurface scattering - can be used as part of a process for adding realism by simulating the semi- transparent properties of translucent materials such as human skin. * In computer vision single-view or multi-view images depth maps, or other types of images, are used to model 3D shapes or reconstruct them . Depth maps can be generated by 3D scannersSchuon, Sebastian, et al. \\"Lidarboost: Depth superresolution for tof 3d shape scanning.\\" Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2009. or reconstructed from multiple images.Malik, Aamir Saeed, ed. Depth map and 3D imaging applications: algorithms and technologies: algorithms and technologies. IGI Global, 2011. * In Machine vision and computer vision, to allow 3D images to be processed by 2D image tools. Generating and reconstructing 3D shapes from single or multi-view depth maps or silhouettes  Limitations  * Single channel depth maps record the first surface seen, and so cannot display information about those surfaces seen or refracted through transparent objects, or reflected in mirrors. This can limit their use in accurately simulating depth of field or fog effects. * Single channel depth maps cannot convey multiple distances where they occur within the view of a single pixel. This may occur where more than one object occupies the location of that pixel. This could be the case - for example - with models featuring hair, fur or grass. More generally, edges of objects may be ambiguously described where they partially cover a pixel. * Depending on the intended use of a depth map, it may be useful or necessary to encode the map at higher bit depths. For example, an 8 bit depth map can only represent a range of up to 256 different distances. * Depending on how they are generated, depth maps may represent the perpendicular distance between an object and the plane of the scene camera. For example, a scene camera pointing directly at - and perpendicular to - a flat surface may record a uniform distance for the whole surface. In this case, geometrically, the actual distances from the camera to the areas of the plane surface seen in the corners of the image are greater than the distances to the central area. For many applications, however, this discrepancy is not a significant issue.

Part of the original cast, Tom was portrayed by Adrian Keeling from the shows first episode until May the following year when the character starred in a high profile storyline where Tom went missing. He returned later in the year to finish the storyline off. The character debuted as the patriarch of the original family unit on the show, the Neilsons. He was a paramedic alongside Sam Aleni (Rene Naufahu) and worked at Shortland Street clinic, where his wife Marj (Elizabeth McRae) fronted reception. Tom had four sons, Patrick, villainous Darryl (Mark Ferguson), Damien (Mark Ferguson) and original teenage heart throb Stuart (Martin Henderson). The character's yearlong run saw the character participate in numerous storylines, including teenage pregnancy, rape, drug abuse, illness and a storyline that saw Tom become a missing person. The storyline that saw Tom go missing became hugely popular, so much so that Tom was eventually brought back to finish off the storyline. It is now remembered as one of the most iconic storylines in the early days of the soap opera. Creation and Casting Adrian Keeling was cast as Tom, the patriarch of the Neilson family unit. Keeling resigned from the role after his initial 1-year contract expired and the character was written off as running away from his family. This was the writers original pitch to get rid of the character, but public interest was so high, the character returned in November only to be killed off once and for all. Storylines Tom was shocked in May 1992 when teenage son Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson) claimed to be the father of a new born baby. However Tom soon learnt this was not the case and the true father was Tom and Marj's (Elizabeth McRae) manipulative other son, Darryl (Mark Ferguson). Tom started to suffer from narcolepsy and was almost burnt the Neilson family home down when he fell asleep and knocked a blanket over a heater. Tom would strike up a friendship with Alison Raynor (Danielle Cormack)'s mother Irene which caused jealousy on Marj's part, but Tom assured Marj nothing was going on. Disaster struck later on when Tom was crushed in a building collapse. An ill Tom eventually recovered but he soon learnt Darryl had attempted to rape Kirsty (Angela Dotchin) and kicked his son out of the house. Tom was distraught when Marj revealed she was allowing her daughter she adopted out at birth, Jane (Katherine McRae) to enter their lives. Tom could not cope with Marj's lies and the marriage deteriorated to a point in early 1993, when Tom told Marj he was going to the dairy to get some cream and did not return. Marj was devastated expecting the worst, but she soon realized their savings had been cleared, meaning Tom was likely alive. In September 1993 Marj was contacted by a woman who claimed to be in a cult with Tom and who asked Marj for money. Marj refused to pay the mystery women and Tom surprisingly returned to her life in October 1993 when he revealed he needed time off and had been living in a cult. Tom also revealed he needed a kidney transplant and an upset Darryl volunteered his. Shortly after the surgery, Tom had a massive heart attack and died, with Darryl by his side. His funeral was held a few days later with his friends and colleagues attending. Paul Holmes appeared on the soap opera, fictionally covering Tom's disappearance. Character Development =Missing Person Storyline= When Keeling decided to leave the role, producers decided to make the character go through a missing person storyline, where he ditched his wife and children after the marriage dissolved as a result of Marj's illegitimate daughter. The storyline seemed an \\"economical\\" write out and helped develop the seemingly two-dimensional character of Marj. It featured Tom going to the dairy and not returning, with Marj discovering he had emptied the savings. Broadcaster Paul Holmes made a guest appearance on the show, featuring Tom's disappearance on his talk show. The storyline became hugely popular, with Keeling getting constantly hassled on the street by fans. Keeling's co star, Michael Galvin who portrayed Dr. Chris Warner enjoyed the storyline and liked how they left it mysteriously open. Fans continued to ask what happened to Tom which annoyed Keeling, resulting in him begging to be written back into the soap. Producers also decided it was best the audience got closure and so Tom was written back into the soap, with the explanation he had been living in a cult but returned needing a kidney transplant. The character stayed on the show for several weeks in a guest role before being killed off, suffering a heart attack while recovering from surgery. Galvin disapproved of Tom being written back in, describing it as a \\"cop out\\". Reception The storyline that saw Tom go missing is still hailed as one of the most iconic storylines ever featured in the soap opera and the write out featuring Tom going to get cream and never returning, later became a codename when writers wrote off characters, with writers being quoted as saying; \\"Sorry, you're going to buy the cream, mate.\\" References Category:Shortland Street characters Category:Fictional paramedics Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Tom Neilson"},{"id":"30617811","text":"Zupfgeigenhansel was a German folk duo, one of the most successful groups to emerge on the German folk scene in the 1970s.

It is international in character and composition, and welcomes ecumenical students from other Christian churches and ecclesial communities, as well as those from non-Christian religions. Mission The Lay Centre's mission is threefold: * To provide a formation program for the resident student community based on the four pillars of formation for Christian ministry and leadership, identified by the Holy See: spiritual, intellectual, human and pastoral. * To provide ongoing adult faith formation to the anglophone community of Rome. * To provide a series of international programs giving church leaders and other laity from around the world a unique opportunity to explore the history and theology of Rome. History The Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas was founded in 1986 by Prof. Donna Orsuto and Ms. Riekie van Velzen as a community for the lay students at the Pontifical Universities in Rome. Orsuto completed her Doctorate in Sacred Theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in 1990 with a dissertation entitled Saint Catherine of Siena : trinitarian experience and mission in the Church. She is Professor at the Institute of Spirituality of the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy, and an Adjunct Professor of the Faculty of Theology at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. Recognizing a need for a resident college open to lay people who were not members of religious communities, and seeing an opportunity in the closing of the Casa Foyer Unitas, the Lay Centre opened on 1 October 1986 with a community of nine students. =Foyer Unitas= Foyer Unitas,Josefa Koet, Leideke Galema, Marion M. van Assendelft, Hearth of Unity: Forty Years of Foyer Unitas, 1952-1992, Bethany, The Netherlands, 1996. https://books.google.com/books?id=htJO2blRM74C&lpg;=PA11&dq;=book%20hearth%20of%20unity&hl;=en&pg;=PA4#v=onepage&q;=book%20hearth%20of%20unity&f;=false meaning ‚ÄúHearth of Unity‚Äù, had itself started as an information centre for non-Catholic pilgrims and visitors to Rome during the Holy Year of 1950, directed by Charles Boyer, SJ, at the request of Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini (later Pope Paul VI), who was then responsible for ordinary affairs at the Secretariat of State. Two years later, a Dutch religious institute with a charism for ecumenism and hospitality, the Ladies of Bethany, received an invitation from Pope Pius XII to expand their ministry to Rome and assist Fr. Boyer with the Foyer Unitas. In addition to the general information centre work, the Ladies of Bethany provided specialized tours around Rome and Vatican City, combining catechesis, theology, church history, art and architecture with an awareness of the particular interests of ecumenical pilgrims. In 1956 they expanded their facilities to accommodate resident students. By 1962 the pending Vatican II Council prompted another relocation and expansion, this time to the Collegio Innocenziano in the complex of the Palazzo Pamphilj, next to the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone on Piazza Navona. While there, Foyer Unitas served as the residence for official ecumenical observers at the Council and their families, and was the site of weekly briefing sessions offered by various periti of the Council to the ecumenical observers. These briefings, conducted in English and other modern languages (in contrast to the official business of the Council, in Latin) proved so popular that soon several of the Council Fathers began attending as well. At least four of the major documents of the Council were drafted during these consultations. Among the peritii who presented at the briefings, and who resided at Foyer Unitas for a short time, was Prof. Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). By 1986, however, changes in Italian law which required religious guest houses to meet the same codes as hotels and pensione, combined with the ageing of the original staff, prompted the Ladies of Bethany to close Foyer Unitas. It was at this time that two of their au pair student staff proposed to use the space to open a resident community, which they dubbed the Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas. =The Lay Centre= The Lay Centre community stayed in the site of Foyer Unitas for 15 years, even expanding to include a second location at the Venerable English College nearby. In 2001, to accommodate the growing numbers and bring the residents of the two sites back together, the Lay Centre relocated to a house on the property of the Pontifical Irish College, near San Giovanni in Laterano. In 2009, after two years of negotiations, the Lay Centre leased a section of the Passionist Retreat of Sts. John and Paul, on the Caelian hill overlooking the Coliseum, allowing more space for the resident community and the other programs. An official inauguration of the new site was celebrated in April 2010, featuring vespers presided by Bishop Brian Farrell of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and a reflection offered by U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, Miguel D√≠az.L'Osservatore Romano Weekly Edition in English, 2010 number 17, Trinitarian Values of Community, Hospitality, and Dialogue, p.15. 28 April 2010 , http://www.laycentre.org/L'Osservatore%20Roman%2028%20April%202010.pdf Over the years, the programs and scope of formation offered by the Lay Centre has expanded. The resident community remains relatively small, compared to the number of lay students in Rome, but the impact of the Centre is extensive. Formation The Lay Centre has developed, in collaboration with the Congregation for Catholic Education, a comprehensive program of formation appropriate to the lay person called to an ecclesial vocation, grounded in the baptismal priesthood. The program assists the lay faithful to discern their vocation within the communion and mission of the church. Its program is based on the four pillars of formation outlined by the Catholic Church in various documents: Human, Spiritual, Intellectual and Pastoral.USCCB, Co-Workers in the Vineyard of the Lord: A Resource for Guiding the Development of Lay Eccleisal Ministers, USCCB: 2005. p33-50 http://www.usccb.org/laity/laymin/co- workers.pdfUSCCB, Program of Priestly Formation, Fifth Edition, USCCB: 2006, p.28-88 http://www.usccb.org/vocations/ProgramforPriestlyFormation.pdf The Spiritual formation includes the opportunity for daily participation in the Liturgy of the Hours, particularly vespers. Wednesday evenings are community evenings which begin with the liturgy of the Eucharist, with a guest presider, usually a bishop or priest from one of the curial dicasteries or pontifical universities. A chapel, with the Blessed Sacrament reserved, is available to residents twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. For students in Rome‚Äôs Pontifical Universities, the classroom provides only a part of the intellectual formation that all students are expected to receive while enrolled. The rest is to be found in their respective colleges. To that end, part of the weekly community evening is a presentation on a topic of contemporary church life, theology, ecumenism, or spirituality from the guest presider, in an informal setting over dinner. Additionally, residents are able to take advantage of the ongoing formation programs offered by the centre. Human formation takes the form of a variety of excursions through the city of Rome focusing on church and civil history, art and architecture, and culture. Students engage on a daily basis in the ‚Äúdialogue of life‚Äù with a diverse community which spans the globe. The daily life of the community encourages consideration of others‚Äô different cultural assumptions, and all share housekeeping responsibilities. Volunteer placement in services around the city is available with groups such as the Missionaries of Charity and the Community of Sant‚ÄôEgidio. Residents prepare to serve alongside presbyters and deacons, monks and mendicants, lay ecclesial ministers and people involved in lay movements. As students of pontifical faculties, most will serve in an ecclesial vocation, often as an academic theologian or lay ecclesial minister at the national or diocesan level. Part of the pastoral formation is learning to work with the variety of people in a variety of ministries in the exercise of their service for the church. Community In addition to this program of formation, The Lay Centre provides students with a comfortable room that includes internet and telephone connectivity, and an active community life: Wednesday formation evenings, three-meals each day (including a self-service breakfast), the space and time for communal prayer, and regularly scheduled cultural and social events. The Lay Centre staff is on hand to ease the transition to Roman life, and to provide the students with practical support. All residents are involved in The Lay Centre‚Äôs activities, from day-to-day, simple house tasks to helping with our various lecture series at special times during the year. Hospitality is a key theme of the Lay Centre, and owes much to the charism of the Ladies of Bethany and Foyer Unitas out of which the Lay Centre was born. Part of this is the commitment to welcoming ecumenical and interreligious guests into the community‚Äôs dialogue of life, while maintaining a Catholic identity. Part of this ministry is in small acts of hospitality, welcoming guests to community meals, and inviting the Roman community into the centre for events throughout the year. About twenty-five people can reside full-time in the Lay Centre, typically representing a broad international and interreligious diversity. The 2015-2016 community, for example, included residents from eighteen countries and eleven religious traditions: Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed, Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christians; Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Unitarian Universalist, and T'ienti Teachings are all represented. Continuing Formation Programs =Vincent Pallotti Institute= The Vincent Pallotti Institute was founded as the Rome branch of Education for Parish Service (EPS) of Trinity College in Washington, DC. EPS had been founded in 1978 to ‚ÄúTo prepare as many Catholics as possible to live out their baptismal commitment to evangelization.‚Äù In 1986, EPS negotiated with Foyer Unitas to coordinate its programming in Rome, assisted by residents of the nascent Lay Centre. EPS closed its doors in 2011, but the Lay Centre continues to offer programming in the name of the Vincent Pallotti Institute. A series of classes are offered on Thursday mornings to the anglophone community of Rome, bringing in lecturers from the pontifical faculties, the Roman curia, and guest lecturers from throughout the Catholic world. St. Vincent Pallotti was a Roman priest who, early in the 19th century, established a program of ongoing evangelization and catechesis for Catholic laity. =Oasis in the City= The Oasis in the City evening events are free lectures and presentations open to the public, offered in both Italian and English. Recent presenters have included Rev. Dr. Olav Fykse Tveit, General Secretary of the World Council of Churches; Rev. Timothy Radcliffe, OP, former Master of the Order; Rabbi Jack Bemporad of the Center for Interreligious Understanding; Archbishop Luis Ladaria, SJ, of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and Mary McAleese, president emeritus of Ireland. International Programs The Lay Centre offers the laity a unique opportunity to explore the history and theology of Rome. A variety of formats include weeklong and weekend study programs designed for parishes, universities, and other organizations. Programs are shaped by the Catholic traditions of liturgical prayer, erudite study, lively dialogue, and pilgrimage to various Christian sites in the Eternal City. Types of programs include a three-week January-term program for university students; week-long thematic programs open to lay ecclesial ministers, teachers, and other lay leaders from around the world; and tailored programs for particular groups, such as the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities. The most recent was a conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of the opening of Vatican II, co-organized with the National Association of Lay Ministry in the U.S.http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/remembering-women-vatican-ii Leadership and Organization The Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas is a legally recognized institute in Italy. In the United States it is incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation and is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. It is governed by an eight-member Board of Directors, which includes a Passionist priest and a former resident. An Honorary Board supports the work of the Lay Centre, and includes expert Vaticanist John Allen, Jr; Archbishop Michael L. Fitzgerald, Apostolic Nuncio to Egypt; Ambassador Tony Hall (ret.) and Secretary James Nicholson (ret.). The co-founders of the Lay Centre, Professor Donna Orsuto, DSG, and Ms. Reikie van Velzen, DSS, serve as director and administrator, respectively. Other staff includes a chief operating officer, office manager, cooks, and facilities staff. Resident community members are also responsible for sharing in a number of house jobs and staffing the local education events. A handful of residents have a kind of 'work-study' arrangement of about 20-25 hours a week of additional support of programs in exchange for room and board. The annual operating budget (as of 2015): Revenues totaled approximately $765,000, including: * $215,000 from resident rent and membership fees, * $200,000 from program fees, * $350,000 from grants and donations. Expenses totaled $800,000, including: * $135,000 in rent, * $310,000 in payroll and benefits expenses, * $80,000 in payroll taxes. =Papal recognition= As part of the 25th anniversary of the Lay Centre, on 1 December 2011, during Eucharist celebrated by Archbishop Joseph Tobin, CSsR, at the Basilica of Giovanni e Paolo, the co- founders of the Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas were honored by Pope Benedict XVI in the form of investiture into papal orders of knighthood: Donna Orsuto was created a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and Riekie van Velzen was created a Dame of the Order of Pope St. Sylvester.

It lies 20 kilometers east of Norrk√∂ping and 16 kilometers northeast of S√∂derk√∂ping, Sweden. parish on Vikbolandet east of Norrk√∂ping city in the province of √ñsterg√∂tland in Sweden in a large household with many siblings, a sister and four brothers and also some other children in the household within the family. Varby had been in the family since the 17th century. The home was strictly religious, and his father turned to the Bible for daily guidance. After finishing school Carl worked as a painter's apprentice at 17‚Äì18 years of age (1896‚Äì1897). In 1898 he moved to Norrk√∂ping. He was a non-commissioned officer in Vaxholm in the Stockholm archipelago at the Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 1), in the Swedish Coastal Artillery, which was just formed in 1902, at 21‚Äì23 years of age (1900‚Äì1902). =The emigration to the United States in 1902= At the age of 23 Carl E. Wallin emigrated to the United States of America in December 1902, and at first he came to Denver in Colorado. From Gothenburg he travelled by boat, by the American lines steamship S/S Rollo, to Grimsby seaport on the eastcoast of England and then by railway via London to Southampton on the south-east coast of England. From Southampton he departed by steamship S/S Saint Paul to New York City. \\"After crossing the ocean in 7 days\\" he arrived in New York City on December 14, 1902. From New York City he travelled via Chicago and Kansas City, Kansas, and then he arrived in Denver in Colorado. =Studies in Denver and at School of the Art Institute of Chicago= Denver, Colorado, as it looked like in 1898, a few years before Carl E. Wallin arrived there in 1902. The photographer was William Henry Jackson (1843‚Äì1942), an American painter, Civil War veteran, geological survey photographer and an explorer famous for his images of the American West. He stayed in Denver and worked during the days and began studying at an art school in the evenings. Carl E. Wallin had, like his older brother, the artist David Wallin, always been interested in art and got after his arrival to America, \\"the opportunity to study at Reed's Art School in Denver, Colorado, where he studied at evening teaching for two years (1903‚Äì1904)\\". In 1904 he moved to Chicago, Illinois. Chicago was the city with the second highest number of Swedes after Stockholm, the capital of Sweden (in the year 1900). By then, Swedes in Chicago had founded a church and established such enduring institutions as a hospital and a university. Chicago is the largest city in the state of Illinois. In Chicago he settled down to study at the art academy at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), Illinois, where he studied for three years (1905‚Äì1908). The school is also associated with the encyclopedic fine art museum the Art Institute of Chicago.Art Institute of Chicago in the Encyclopedia of Chicago The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) is one of America's largest independent schools of art and design, located in The Loop, Chicago. =Marriage and painting contractor in Chicago= While studying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago Carl E. Wallin married Hilma H√∂gberg in 1907, a young girl who was only 20 years old, and Carl was 28 years old. Their first home was in Cook County, Chicago, Illinois and Carl worked as a self-employed and entrepreneurial and ran his own painting company while he painted for his own amusement. He devoted his free time to the art, because he was nearly always occupied to do his work with his business as contractor painter as a self- employed person. Common traits of entrepreneurs are curiosity, creativity, a positive approach to work, independence, perseverance, dedication, optimism and visionary thinking. Chicago in Cook County was Carl's and Hilma's residence city and it is the second most populous county in the United States after Los Angeles County. His wife Hilma Wallin died in 1951. Oil paintings and motifs Carl E. Wallin mostly painted in oil and his subjects were portraits and landscapes, often winter motifs, and figures, nature pictures and symbolic fantasy compositions. He was often known for landscapes with figures which was his speciality and he often painted in oil in the style of early 20th-century modernist painting before 1950. He owned an awaken eye for the beautifulness in the nature and for a long time he strived to render everything as true to life as possible on his canvases. Later on his development led into another direction. That was the idea or the thought behind the work of art that was so much important from his part of view. His works also showed a great richness of ideas and fantasy. He did not belong to the ultramodern school. He himself thought that a work of art was unsuccessful if not anyone else but the artist himself could understand it. There ought to be an idea behind every painting. Wallin's genius is peculiarly his own. He is original and his paintings of fantasy are creations of his own, which remind one of the work of the French artist Gustave Dor√©. Gustave Dor√© is an artist who has been labeled in the art genre fantastic art. Many of Wallin's paintings have won signal honors at the Chicago Art Institute, where he was a student for four years. He has won several prizes. There are inspirations of biblical figure paintings in the oil paintings \\"Gethsemane\\" (1931), \\"Spirit of Allegheny Mountains\\", \\"Nymphs beside pool\\", \\"Nude on beach\\", \\" Garden of Eden\\", \\" Sorrows before Paradise\\" and \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and of his mythological figure paintings from the greek mythology in \\"Siren\\" (1934).

Prices He won several prices and he also received many awards and honors at the Swedish- American exhibitions. Carl E. Wallin exhibited in Sweden at the 1920 Swedish- American touring exhibition in Stockholm. It was a touring exhibition with the 100 best works, which was completed during the last 10 years of Swedish- American artists and the exhibition was opened in Stockholm on June 6, 1920. \\"At an art exhibition at the Swedish club's building in Chicago the painter Carl E. Wallin was awarded first prize for an oil painting, and which amount came to $100 and had been donated by the State Bank of Chicago. The price awarded work was \\"Evening Fantasy\\" and it had been brought up as number 107 in the catalog for the exhibition\\", according to a Chicago newspaper in the 1920s.Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois, USA, Swenson Swedish Immigration Research Center, 639 38th Street, Rock Island, Illinois 61201-2299, http://www.augustana.edu/x18911.xml Collection of Riksf√∂reningen Sverigekontakt Sweden maintained an almost maternal relationship to its emigrant artists during the period of heaviest emigration to America, 1880‚Äì1920. The emigrant artists were included in dictionaries on equal footing with those artists who remained in Sweden. A number of paintings in the collection of Riksf√∂reningen Sverigekontakt appear to have come from the 1929 exhibition of \\"Swedish-American Artists Given Under the Auspices of the Swedish American Art Association\\" at Illinois Women's Athletic club, March 10‚Äì17, 1929. Although the catalog does not give measurement, several titles correlate with the collection in Gothenburg. For example, Carl. E. Wallin's painting \\"Icebound\\", listed in the 1929 catalog for the Chicago exhibition, could possibly be the collection's painting \\"Fj√§llets Sj√§l\\", (\\"Mountain Face\\"), a winter mountainous landscape in which a nude painted in shades of white and grey, is encased in snow on the face of the steep mountain peak. Wallin's painting from the 1928 exhibition, \\"Fantasy in Frost\\" has a title that also correlates with the subject matter of the work in the collection. His mystical landscapes were shown in several Swedish-American art exhibitions during the 1920s and his work is in the collection of Riksf√∂reningen Sverigekontakt.A Tangled Web: Swedish Immigrant Artists' Patronage Systems, 1880-1940, Chapter 7: Swedish Patronage Network Encourage Artists' Careers and Ethnic Collections, page 6, Swedish Immigrant Artists' Patronage Systems, 1880-1940 =Exhibitions at The Swedish Club of Chicago= Carl E.

The agrarian programme of SDJ was detailed, but did not deviate from the SSV line significantly. The organization argued that independent farmers, owning their own plots, should have the right to trade full ownership to a modernized √•bor√§tt (copyhold), thus relieving them from debts. SDJ also sought to improve the economic position of its members, for example by promoting setting up cooperatives and economic associations. The members were generally independent farmers. In situations when independent farmers who were members of SDJ took up jobs as labourers at estates, the organization managed negotiations over wages and price lists.

Overview  Tachikawa-ryu is a former branch of Shingon Mikkyo founded by the monk Ninkan. In another unorthodox branch of Shingon, Ono-ryu (Â∞èÈáéÊµÅ).Religion in Japan : arrows to heaven and earth / edited by P.F. Kornicki and I.J. McMullen Cambridge University Press New York 1996. p.18 As such it is a school of esoteric Buddhism founded on the principal of using energy to control supernatural and cosmic forces and through these energetic rites and rituals to attain enlightenment. Tachikawa-ryu is no different in its approach except that it chooses to focus on sexual energy thus belonging to left-hand tantra. Its use of ritual sexual energy and accusations of involvement in so called \\"black\\" magic, the school was frowned upon by orthodox Shingon leaders (who performed non-sexual right hand Tantra rituals), and its monks were frequently sent into exile. The monk Y≈´kai (1345‚Äì1416) is generally credited with taking the lead on extirpating the Tachikawa-ryu school from Shingon.http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3402600425/tachikawaryu.html Tachikawa-ryu was, like Shingon, based in vajrayana-tantra which were very close in style to Hevajra and Candamaharosana Tantra-based consecrations that had in 10th and 11th centuries. In contradistinction to the \\"mixed esotericism\\" of Tantra, of which two medieval movements were termed jakyo (heresies). One of these, injected into Shingon from Tibet via Chinese Daoism, was the Tachikawa-ryu.Tantra in Practice. David Gordon White (2001) . Page 21 Unlike its orthodox cousin it was much more inclined towards 'secret' left- hand tantra rituals with its usage of sexual energy as a method to attain bliss. Ninkan primarily used, founder of Shingon, K≈çb≈ç Daishi's (K≈´kai Á©∫Êµ∑) text sokushin j≈çbutsu (Âç≥Ë∫´Êàê‰ªè) (Bodily Buddhahood) to support his ideologies and views. This caused discontent in the orthodox followers. Since most Tachikawa- ryu texts were destroyed much of its history and teachings must be reconstructed. The institutes who do have Tachikawa-ryu texts and information pertaining to the school are generally unsympathetic and hostile towards Tachikawa-ryu ideologies and therefore refuse to lend any sort of help to the matter.(Sanford 1991) History The school was founded in 1113 by the Shingon monk Ninkan associated with Daigo-ji Temple, was exiled from Koyasan to the province of Izu after getting caught on the wrong side of a political dispute. In Izu, he met an Onmyoji (Onmyodo: Taoism, Japanese esoteric cosmology) master from \\"Musashi no Tachikawa (Tachikawa of Musashi Province)\\" named Kenren (Ë¶ãËìÆ also ÂÖºËìÆ). Together the two created the school of Tachikawa- ryu.(Sanford 1991) Ninkan taught mikkyo to specialist in yin-yang and Yijing divination in Musashi region, and regarded as a founder of Tachikawa-ryu, a heretical Shingon sect. Whether or not they can credited to Ninkan himself, the Taoist elements in Fuju shu rituals are plain to see, and would appear at least early Muromachi period.Religion in Japan : arrows to heaven and earth / edited by P.F. Kornicki and I.J. McMullen Cambridge University Press New York 1996. p.14 The Fuju shu represents the practice of Tozan-ha which is one of the main lineages in Shugendo. In the Muromachi period Tozan-ha are under the administrative control of the Samb≈ç-in at Daigoji. Ninkan, a younger brother of Shokaku, the founder of the famous Sambo-in at Daigoji.Flowing traces: Buddhism in the literary and visual arts of Japan, James H. Sanford, William R. LaFleur, Masatoshi Nagatomi - 2014; Publisher: Princeton University Press Tachikawa-ryu must have been largely created within the few months Ninkan was exiled and committed suicide. Many historians believe he is mentioned simply as an apocryphal figure. Regardless, he would have had to draw on ideas already prevalent in Japanese society and within the orthodox branches of Shingon-sh≈´ (Shingon Buddhism) at the time, as there simply was not enough time for him to develop an entirely new branch and ideology before he died. Ninkan committed suicide less than a year later in 1114 by throwing himself off a cliff in protest, and it was left to Kenren to propagate the school. (Sanford 1991) It appears from the historical record that Tachikawa-ryu was very widely accepted and practiced and by the middle of the 13th century during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period had become a major contender with the orthodox branch of Shingon. This marks what is considered the second period of the school. Beginning in the 13th century the orthodox branch of Shingon at Koyasan began a smear campaign against Tachikawa-ryu. This second period lasted until about 1500AD. The discrimination and attack by the orthodox branch at Koyasan reached its climax in about 1470AD. From 1470-1500 marks the beginning of the third period, of the school. By this time the orthodox branch of Shingon had managed to formally denounce and excommunicate most teachings and practitioners of Tachikawa-ryu from its ranks. However, it was still very popular with the general populace. Tachikawa-ryu works were still published in works such as Sangi Isshin-ki (The Three Worlds Single Heart), Fud≈ç-son Gush≈ç (Humble Notes on the Immovable Lord), and Konk≈ç-sh≈ç (Compendium of the Primal Cavity). Tachikawa-ryu ideas and influences also appeared in cultic practices with Dual Ganesha (ÂèåË∫´Ê≠ìÂñúÂ§©, S≈çshin Kangiten) and Aizen My≈ç-≈å (Ragaraja), and in the other main orthodox school of mikkyo Tendai, in their extinct Genshi Kimy≈çdan cult. And also in the teachings and ideologies of Jodoshinshu (Pure Land Faith), especially the Himitsu Nembutsu (Secret Mystery of Mindfulness of Amida Buddha) developed by Kakuban and D≈çhan. (Sanford 1991)  Theory and practice  The two main schools of Japanese Esoteric Buddhism are Shingon and Tendai. Tachikawa-ryu belonged to the first of these schools. It was injected into Shingon from Tibet via Taoism. First off, Tachikawa-ryu as a school of tantra is first and foremost a system of correspondences between microcosm (male) and macrocosm (female). Thus Tachikawa-ryu, as Shingon and Tendai, can be thought of as a reintegration of the world into the soteriological path, since man and world, man and the universe, are now fundamentally the same. In any case it is important to realize that sexuality is of an eminently cosmological and ritual nature. The union of male and female principals is seen as the source of all phenomena, expressed as the union of the godhead (male/Shiva) with his divinity or consort (female/Shakti) who represents the source of his power and wisdom. (White 2000) In Tachikawa-ryu ritual sex is the primary h≈çben (skillful means) to enlightenment. Rites and rituals such as the famous Skull Ritual and the Horse Penis Ritual were initiations that involved the union of male (h≈çben ‚Äì skillful/expedient means) with female (wisdom) to enact union with deity and sacred consort. These types of rituals aim to create and identify the practitioner with the deity/Emperor at the center of the mandala - which is the center of all tantric practice and theory. The mandala is the tantric symbol of royal power, the seat of the Son of Heaven, the super position, the divine throne of High Jupiter. It is this notion that the king/emperor, standing at the center of his kingdom which he rules from the center mirrors the godhead‚Äôs heavenly celestial kingdom that the sex Rites and Rituals enacted by practitioners' of Tachikawa-ryu are aimed at creating. This royal ideology of \\"galactic polity\\", the \\"exemplary center\\" comprising the king (male), his deity (female) and the capital (mandala), from which he rules, all united together as a single all encompassing force of divine high regality. Tachikawa-ryu practices, just as in orthodox Shingon, is aimed at enacting this esoteric union of macrocosmic (female) and microcosmic (male) and through their union create an idealized \\"utopia\\", the idealized constructed kingdom of the Godhead (metacosm) with the practitioners as King and Gods, self-made gods, in this case Dainichi Nyorai (Â§ßÊó•Â¶ÇÊù•)(Vairocana) (also seen as Amaterasu) itself. (White, 2000) Dakini-ten (ËçºÊû≥Â∞ºÂ§©) was worshiped. In Shingon mikkyo, Dakini (ËçºÊû≥Â∞º) is an \\"evil\\" (keeping in mind that such concepts lay in the eye of the beholder), also a trickster or impish like spirit who is an associate of Enma-ten Yama (Hinduism) YamarƒÅja (‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú) the god of death.Tenbu no butsuzo jiten (Tokyo bijutsu sensho) (Japanese) Tank≈çbon Hardcover by Ryosuke Nishigori Sacred texts (tantras) The primary literature for all schools of orthodox Shingon are the Mahavairocana Tantra, the Vajrasekhara Sutra, the Adhyardha≈õatikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ Sutra (Rishu-ky≈ç), and the SusiddhikƒÅra S≈´tra (Soshitsuji-ky≈ç ËòáÊÇâÂú∞Áµå). These are the four principle texts of Esoteric Buddhism. They are all Tantras, literally \\"treatise\\", \\"exposition\\". These texts played a vital role in Tachikawa-ryu as well. According to the author and Tachikawa-ryu historian John Stevens, perhaps the most important text to the ry≈´ha (ÊµÅÊ¥æ), was the Sutra of Secret Bliss (ca. 1100), the full title of which is Sutra Proclaiming the Secret Method Enabling a Man and a Woman to Experience the Bliss of Buddhahood in this Very Body. This sutra contains the school's general teachings concerning sexuality and its role in reaching enlightenment. It was Rishu-ky≈ç (The Sino-Japanese Tantric Praj√±apƒÅramitƒÅ in 150 Verses (Amoghavajra's Version)). =Sutra of Secret Bliss= The text itself is a short tantra (exposition). It reads as follows: \\"Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman is the supreme buddha activity. Sex is the source of intense pleasure, the root of creation, necessary for every living being, and a natural act of regeneration. To be united as a man and woman is to united with Buddha.\\" The sound A represents the Womb Realm (Garbhakosa-dhatu; Taizo-kai/ËÉéËîµÁïå), Mother (Yin/in), great compassion, and the red lotus. The sound UN [h≈´·πÉ] represents the Diamond Realm(vajra) (Vajradhatu); Kongo-kai/ÈáëÂâõÁïå), father (yang/yo), wisdom, and the white stupa. A/Un (the alpha and omega) represents is female/male (non- duality, paradox), yin yang, ocean/mountain, mercy/charity, emptiness/form. The red seed from the female and the white seed from the male bring human beings into existence. The unity and integration of A/Un creates and sustains the universe. This is the truth, not falsehood. Prior to performing these rites, the man and woman take these vows: 1) We trust in the teachings of the Tachikawa-ryu. 2) We vow to cooperate and come together in mutual accord in the body and mind at all times. 3) We vow to perform these rites carefully under strict supervision by a master of Tachikawa-ryu. 4) We vow to try not to argue or fight. 5) We vow to try and avoid competing, making unconstructive criticisms, or blame each other. 6) We vow to try not to over indulge in food or drink. The Buddha couple should bathe together in a curative hot spring without physical contact. The couple must be in perfect accord in body, mind, and speech. The couple must be in bright, positive mood, free of gloom, despair, or unhappiness. The man is venerated as Fudo Myo-O (Acala)(‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéã); the woman is venerated and embodies Aizen myo-O (ÊÑõÊüìÊòéÁéã) (RƒÅgarƒÅja). The holy couple faces each other and they make the three prostrations (Sanrai ‰∏âÁ§º). Reciting: Male: \\"I aspire to enter the Womb Realm.\\" Female: \\"I aspire to receive the Diamond Realm (vajra).\\" The room must be spotless and absolutely clean, well secluded, with a small altar. The secret Buddha image is kept veiled, not to be uncovered until after the rites are performed. Kuden (Âè£‰ºù) (secret oral teaching), the instructions regarding the Buddha image are only to transmitted orally and never written down. Fresh flowers are placed on the altar, together with appropriate seasonal offerings from the mountains and the sea. Kindle fragrant incense. Light the room with five candles. (The candles are the five colors of the elements and are placed in the appropriate direction: fire-red, south; water-black, north; wood-green/blue, east; earth-yellow, south; void- white, west) The Buddha image is one's own body. Therefore, the man and woman shed their robes in the corner (southwest) and face each other completely naked and adorned. The Rites are to begin at midnight. The man crosses his legs in the full lotus position and the woman sits on the top of the man and lets his jeweled jade stem enter her mysterious gate. (This posture reacts the position of many esoteric deities and their consorts, in particular that of Shiva and Shakti). During the sexual congress of the two roots of existence (A/Un), the breath should be harmonized in an A (inhale) and Un (exhale) rhythm. The man should keep his vajra pressed against the woman's womb as they meditate together, blending the male/female components of the five elements (Godai): earth, water, fire, wood, and air/void. If done properly, this blending of the elements will form a five-colored rainbow: yellow, blue, red, green, and white. The mother/father buddha posture is best, but other postures and mantra are allowed. (Goku-I Kuden Ari: secret oral instructions and essential teachings are given but unknown at this time) However, at the break of dawn when the rooster crows, the Buddha couple should be in the mother/father posture. At that time, the Buddha couple should come to a mutual instant of universal bliss; that is the moment of universal truth, a state of pure ecstasy, an unobstructed integration of emptiness and form. This is the realm of Dainichi Nyorai (Â§ßÊó•Â¶ÇÊù•)(Vairocana), the Cosmic Buddha where myriad elements exist in perfect equilibrium.\\" = Notes on the Sutra of Great Bliss = A 'a' is said to be present in each consonant, and to be the mother of all of the letters. If you open your mouth and breath out the sound is 'a'. In Sanskrit if you add 'a' as a prefix it makes a word have the opposite meaning: Vidya is knowledge; AvidyƒÅ is ignorance. So 'a' came to represent the essence of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ, or Perfection of Wisdom, tradition. This idea was explicitly expressed in the Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom in One Letter, that letter being 'a'. In Buddhism phenomena are said to neither absolutely exist, nor non-exist - they arise in dependence on conditions, and cease when those conditions cease. This is similar to a Hindu aphorism about reality which says: not this, not this. Conceptual categories such as existence and non-existence are not able to encompass the true nature of phenomena. Un (h≈´·πÉ)- The various aspects take in all Truths, all teachings, all practices, and all attainments. It summarises the two basic false views of nihilism and eternalism, and shows them to be false. The Truth of things is that they are neither real nor unreal, these categories do not apply ‚Äì this is a restatement of the Buddha‚Äôs fundamental insight into the nature of phenomena. See also Kukai's (K≈çb≈ç-Daishi) Ungi gi (meaning of the syllable h≈´·πÉ/hum). The role of the man as Fudo Myo-O (‰∏çÂãïÊòéÁéã) (Acala), and the woman as Aizen Myo-O RƒÅgarƒÅja is esoterically symbolic of the man and woman in unbreakable union and irrevocably stained with love/passion. Fudo myo-o is the general of the Five Wisdom Kings, his name means \\"Immovable one\\". Aizen Myo-O is also a Wisdom King, his name means, \\"One who is stained red with love/passion\\". This sums up the central tenet of all Tachikawa-ryu teachings: Buddhahood (infinite compassion, wisdom and liberation) can be obtained through controlled, ritual sexuality between motivated and experienced partners. The Tachikawa adepts are convinced that the loss of self, of ego, which occurs during sexual play can lead toward enlightenment (unbiased objective understanding)- and that the moment of orgasm (called the Lion's Roar) is a moment of revelation.  The Tachikawa Skull Ritual  Among the many rituals and rites practiced by Tachikawa-ryu was the famous Skull Ritual. Rituals involving the use of human or animal skulls are not uncommon. The exact origins of the Tachikawa-ryu Skull Ritual are unknown, but it appears from historical texts to be similar in ritual to Anuttarayoga tantras of Indo-Tibetan Vajrayana-tantra, in particular of particularly Hevajra Tantra and Candamaharosana Tantra. However, without further evidence no other conclusion as to its origin can be made. The description of the Tachikawa-ryu Skull Ritual comes from unknown Shingon monk named Shinj≈ç.The Invention of Religion in Japan. Jason Ananda Josephson (2012) , Page 36 Little if anything is known about Shinj≈ç except what he writes about himself. The Skull Ritual is detailed in one of his works titled Juh≈ç Y≈çjinsh≈´ (ÂèóÊ≥ïÁî®ÂøÉÈõÜ), written about 1270 AD. (Sanford 1991) The ritual is described here as Shinj≈ç describes it for the following reasons: this description is the best description of the ritual, the ritual itself is relatively unknown and shrouded in fallacy, and finally to preserve some record of the Tachikawa-ryu Skull Ritual for antiquity. The Ritual is as follows: = Notes on the skull ritual = The attribution of religious and magical powers to skulls is almost a universal trait. Nonetheless, it is especially prominent in tantric Buddhism. For example, the practitioners of the proto-tantric KƒÅpƒÅlikas (Kapalikas) often carried a staff with a skull on the end of it believing it gave them sidhhi (magical powers). The use of hango-ko (frankincense) to call up the dead may trace back to the folk tale of the ancient Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty. There is also an equally apposite tantric usage to be found in the Hevajra Tantra where it describes the \\"mudra\\" (seal) as a ritual partner in a sex Rite as a girl \\"possessed of frankincense and camphor\\", a characterization that turns out to be an encrypted reference for blood and semen (red and white). Regardless, the religious and magical powers of female blood and male semen (the Twin Waters, or the Red and White) is standard in the more baroque forms of Tantraism. An example is found in the Yoni-Tantra (vagina Tantra) of the Kaulas that recommends that, \\"...the highest sadhaka (officiant) should mix in the water the effusion from yoni (vagina) and lingam (penis), and sipping this amrita (nectar), nourish himself with it.\\" The idea of passing the smoke of incense through the eye holes of the skull is a reflection of the Buddhist belief that incense is pure until empowered by prayer or thought. Then once lit it is purified by the fire of Agni, and the pure distilled intention manifests as smoke which rises to the heavens. Thus by allowing the smoke to pass through the eyes (the eyes are the windows to the soul) the pure distilled intention is captured and condensed with the enclosed cranium of the skull. Shinj≈ç also provides notes in a short Q&A; at the end. Modern times For all practical purposes Tachikawa-ryu is extinct. It was outlawed in the 13th century by the Japanese authorities, and almost all of its writings were either burned, or sealed away at Koya-san and related monasteries. However, there have been claims that the school continued covertly until at least 1689, and some believe that it is still active today, in disguise.Stevens, John (1990).

Basic economics textbooks concentrate on consumers with convex preferences (that do not prefer extremes to in-between values) and convex budget sets and on producers with convex production sets; for convex models, the predicted economic behavior is well understood. When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with market failures, where supply and demand differ or where market equilibria can be inefficient. Non-convex economies are studied with nonsmooth analysis, which is a generalization of convex analysis. Demand with many consumers If a preference set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion. Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both. equilibrium: Consumers can jump between two separate allocations (of equal utility). When the consumer's preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer's demand is not connected; A disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer, as discussed by Harold Hotelling: > If indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy > character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we > are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the > origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others > are essentially unobservable. They can be detected only by the > discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, > leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the > straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the > existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth. The concave > portions of the indifference curves and their many-dimensional > generalizations, if they exist, must forever remain in unmeasurable > obscurity. : The difficulties of studying non-convex preferences were emphasized by Herman WoldPages 231 and 239 (Figure 10 a‚Äìb: Illustration of lemma 5 [page 240]): Exercise 45, page 146: and again by Paul Samuelson, who wrote that non-convexities are \\"shrouded in eternal : > It will be noted that any point where the indifference curves are convex > rather than concave cannot be observed in a competitive market. Such points > are shrouded in eternal darkness‚Äîunless we make our consumer a monopsonist > and let him choose between goods lying on a very convex \\"budget curve\\" > (along which he is affecting the price of what he buys). In this monopsony > case, we could still deduce the slope of the man's indifference curve from > the slope of the observed constraint at the equilibrium point. For the epigraph to their seventh chapter, \\"Markets with non-convex preferences and production\\" presenting , quote John Milton's description of the (non-convex) Serbonian Bog in Paradise Lost (Book II, lines 592‚Äì594): > A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog > Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, > Where Armies whole have sunk. according to Diewert.: When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with market failures, where supply and demand differ or where market equilibria can be inefficient. Non-convex preferences were illuminated from 1959 to 1961 by a sequence of papers in The Journal of Political Economy (JPE). The main contributors were Farrell, Bator, Koopmans, and others‚Äîfor example, and , , , and ‚Äîcommented on : and Rothenberg.: () In particular, Rothenberg's paper discussed the approximate convexity of sums of non-convex sets. These JPE-papers stimulated a paper by Lloyd Shapley and Martin Shubik, which considered convexified consumer-preferences and introduced the concept of an \\"approximate equilibrium\\".: The JPE-papers and the Shapley‚ÄìShubik paper influenced another notion of \\"quasi-equilibria\\", due to Robert Aumann.: builds on two papers: Taking the convex hull of non-convex preferences had been discussed earlier by and by , according to . Non-convex sets have been incorporated in the theories of general economic equilibria,.Pages 392‚Äì399 and page 188: Pages 52‚Äì55 with applications on pages 145‚Äì146, 152‚Äì153, and 274‚Äì275: Theorem C(6) on page 37 and applications on pages 115-116, 122, and 168: These results are described in graduate-level textbooks in microeconomics, Page 628: general equilibrium theory,Page 169 in the first edition: In Ellickson, page xviii, and especially Chapter 7 \\"Walras meets Nash\\" (especially section 7.4 \\"Nonconvexity\\" pages 306‚Äì310 and 312, and also 328‚Äì329) and Chapter 8 \\"What is Competition?\\" (pages 347 and 352): game theory,Theorem 1.6.5 on pages 24‚Äì25: mathematical economics,Pages 127 and 33‚Äì34: and applied mathematics (for economists).Pages 93‚Äì94 (especially example 1.92), 143, 318‚Äì319, 375‚Äì377, and 416: Page 309: Pages 47‚Äì48: The Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma establishes that non-convexities are compatible with approximate equilibria in markets with many consumers; these results also apply to production economies with many small firms.Economists have studied non-convex sets using advanced mathematics, particularly differential geometry and topology, Baire category, measure and integration theory, and ergodic theory: Supply with few producers Non-convexity is important under oligopolies and especially monopolies.Page 1: () Concerns with large producers exploiting market power initiated the literature on non-convex sets, when Piero Sraffa wrote about on firms with increasing returns to scale in 1926, after which Harold Hotelling wrote about marginal cost pricing in 1938. Both Sraffa and Hotelling illuminated the market power of producers without competitors, clearly stimulating a literature on the supply-side of the economy.Pages 5‚Äì7: Contemporary economics Recent research in economics has recognized non-convexity in new areas of economics. In these areas, non- convexity is associated with market failures, where equilibria need not be efficient or where no competitive equilibrium exists because supply and demand differ. Non-convex sets arise also with environmental goods (and other externalities),Pages 106, 110‚Äì137, 172, and 248: and with market failures, and public economics.Pages 63‚Äì65: Starrett discusses non-convexities in his textbook on public economics (pages 33, 43, 48, 56, 70‚Äì72, 82, 147, and 234‚Äì236): Non-convexities occur also with information economics, and with stock markets (and other incomplete markets).Page 270: (Originally published as ): Such applications continued to motivate economists to study non-convex sets. In some cases, non-linear pricing or bargaining may overcome the failures of markets with competitive pricing; in other cases, regulation may be justified. =Optimization over time= The previously mentioned applications concern non-convexities in finite-dimensional vector spaces, where points represent commodity bundles. However, economists also consider dynamic problems of optimization over time, using the theories of differential equations, dynamic systems, stochastic processes, and functional analysis: Economists use the following optimization methods: * calculus of variations, following Frank P. Ramsey and Harold Hotelling; * dynamic programming, following Richard Bellman and Ronald Howard; and * control theory. Slides are available at http://www.utdallas.edu/~sethi/OPRE7320presentation.html In these theories, regular problems involve convex functions defined on convex domains, and this convexity allows simplifications of techniques and economic meaningful interpretations of the results. In economics, dynamic programing was used by Martin Beckmann and Richard F. Muth for work on inventory theory and consumption theory. Robert C. Merton used dynamic programming in his 1973 article on the intertemporal capital asset pricing model. (See also Merton's portfolio problem). In Merton's model, investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, and their solution is found via dynamic programming. Stokey, Lucas & Prescott use dynamic programming to solve problems in economic theory, problems involving stochastic processes. Dynamic programming has been used in optimal economic growth, resource extraction, principal‚Äìagent problems, public finance, business investment, asset pricing, factor supply, and industrial organization. Ljungqvist & Sargent apply dynamic programming to study a variety of theoretical questions in monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxation, economic growth, search theory, and labor economics. Dixit & Pindyck used dynamic programming for capital budgeting. For dynamic problems, non-convexities also are associated with market failures, just as they are for fixed-time problems. =Nonsmooth analysis= Economists have increasingly studied non-convex sets with nonsmooth analysis, which generalizes convex analysis. Convex analysis centers on convex sets and convex functions, for which it provides powerful ideas and clear results, but it is not adequate for the analysis of non-convexities, such as increasing returns to scale.: \\"Non-convexities in [both] production and consumption ... required mathematical tools that went beyond convexity, and further development had to await the invention of non-smooth calculus\\": For example, Clarke's differential calculus for Lipschitz continuous functions, which uses Rademacher's theorem and which is described by and ,Chapter 8 \\"Applications to economics\\", especially Section 8.5.3 \\"Enter nonconvexity\\" (and the remainder of the chapter), particularly page 495: according to . wrote that the \\"major methodological innovation in the general equilibrium analysis of firms with pricing rules\\" was \\"the introduction of the methods of non-smooth analysis, as a [synthesis] of global analysis (differential topology) and [of] convex analysis.\\" According to , \\"Non-smooth analysis extends the local approximation of manifolds by tangent planes [and extends] the analogous approximation of convex sets by tangent cones to sets\\" that can be non-smooth or non-convex.Algebraic topology has also been used to study convex and non-convex sets in economics: See also *Convexity in economics *Shapley‚ÄìFolkman lemma Notes References   External links Category:Convex hulls Category:Convex geometry Category:General equilibrium theory Category:Convex optimization ","title":"Non-convexity (economics)"},{"id":"30618232","text":"Scaddan is a small town in Western Australia located east of Perth situated just off the Coolgardie-Esperance Highway between Norseman and Esperance in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia.

The station transmits its signal from Mount Beacon atop the Marin Headlands above Sausalito, California, while studios are located in the North Beach district of San Francisco. History =Classical KDFC (1948‚Äì2011)= The station had its inception in 1948 by station owner Ed Davis and programmed a Classical music format as KDFC. It remained a Classical station for most of its history, though at one point during the 1950s, it featured a beautiful music format. The station also simulcasted on KIBE, a daytime-only 5 kW AM station in Palo Alto, California that began broadcasting in 1949 from a transmitter near the western approach to the Dumbarton Bridge. It is now a news-talk station. It also had a booster station in Concord, which fills in coverage gaps caused by topography issues. In 1993, Ed Davis' company Sundial Broadcasting sold the AM and FM to Brown Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for $15.5 Million. In 1996 BBC sold the FM station and AM simulcast sister station AM 1220 to Evergreen Media, who in turn sold the FM to Bonneville Broadcasting and the AM to Douglas Broadcasting. In 1997, new station management transitioned KDFC's programming to a more mass-appeal approach, which boosted ratings significantly, though was occasionally criticised for their new \\"top 40 of classical music\\" approach. Bill Leuth, who had done mornings on rival classical station KKHI, moved to mornings at KDFC in 1997, and also contributed to the station's rise and shift from automation to live hosts. In 2003, KDFC became the first station in the Bay Area to broadcast using HD Radio. On January 18, 2007, Bonneville signed an agreement with Entercom Communications Corporation to trade three San Francisco stations ‚Äî KOIT, KMAX, and KDFC ‚Äî for three Entercom stations in Seattle, Washington and four in Cincinnati, Ohio. Entercom officially took ownership of KDFC on February 26, 2007. =Classic Rock K-Fox (2011‚Äì2014)= The University of Southern California announced on January 18, 2011, the purchase of 90.3 KUSF from the University of San Francisco. That same day, a deal, in the works for months prior, was announced to acquire the intellectual property and call letters of KDFC from Entercom, thus making KDFC a listener-supported non- commercial outlet, operated by a San Francisco-based non-profit organization, and also simulcasting on newly acquired 89.9 KNDL in Santa Rosa.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/18/DDV71H9VL2.DTL&tsp;=1 Then, on January 24, 2011 at Noon, after playing \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" by Aaron Copland as performed by the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, KDFC flipped to Classic Rock as \\"Classic Rock K-Fox\\" with the new call letters KUZX. The station was a simulcast of San Jose station KUFX, which Entercom acquired earlier in the month. The first song on \\"K-Fox\\" was \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" by Electric Light Orchestra.http://formatchange.com/102-1-kdfc-becomes-classic-rock- kfox/http://formatchange.com/98-5-kufx-adds-a-simulcast-on-102-1/ The station launched with a full airstaff including Greg Kihn in mornings, Radio vets Tim Jeffries and \\"Big Rick\\" Stuart in middays and afternoons respectively, and Laura Steele hosting nights. KUZX never seemed to gain traction with the simulcast, and throughout its tenure, the station saw many on-air changes, including the additions of KFOG vets Annalisa Parisale for mornings and Bill Webster for nights from 2012‚Äì2013. After Annalisa was let go, the station brought back former K-Fox host Chris Jackson to host mornings. =As KRBQ \\"Q102\\" (2014‚ÄìPresent)= On August 1, 2014, at 2 p.m., after playing \\"One Thing Leads to Another\\" by The Fixx, KUZX abruptly broke away from the simulcast and flipped to a Rhythmic Hot AC format as Q102, The Beat Of The Bay, with the first song being This Is How We Do It by Montell Jordan. Entercom Launches Q102 San Francisco The format was similar to sister station KHTP in Seattle, which has seen success since launching in August 2013. On August 8, 2014, KUZX changed its call letters to KRBQ to match the new branding. On September 2, after promoting a \\"Commercial Free August\\", the station began adding personalities, including Freska in middays, Mia Amor in afternoons, and Hoodrat Miguel hosting nights. On September 15, KRBQ added Bay Area radio vet Joey \\"Joey V.\\" Vlasny and Alexx Dupri to host morning drive. KRBQ also bought back a mix show that was once a staple at KNGY, Clubber's Commute, airing Saturday nights. At the time, KRBQ faced competition from Urban KMEL, Top 40/CHRs KMVQ, KYLD and KREV, Rhythmic Top 40 KVVF, Rhythmic Oldies KISQ (which has since flipped to Soft AC) and Adult Top 40s KLLC and KIOI, as it shared the same music as the other outlets. As of February 2015, KRBQ dropped current tracks (as well as pop and dance titles), and refocused its direction to the growing Classic hip hop format, with occasional 1990's R&B; titles. It now positions itself as \\"The Bay Area's Throwback Station.\\"BDS reporting panel Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (updated February 27, 2015) On April 2, 2018, KRBQ relieved morning host Mia Amor and afternoon host Hoodrat Miguel of their duties, and later announced that Chuy Gomez will take over the morning slot, which comes after his exit from KVVF the previous January.‚ÄúRumor Mill: Lots Of Action Coming To San Francisco?‚Äù from Radio Insight (April 2, 2018) At 10 a.m. on August 12, 2019, after playing \\"Best I Ever Had\\" by Drake, KRBQ flipped to rhythmic oldies with an emphasis on 1970s through 1990s R&B;, while keeping the \\"Q102\\" branding, launching with \\"Let's Groove\\" by Earth, Wind & Fire. The move positions KRBQ closer musically to Bonneville-owned (and former sister station) KBLX, and its new logo has a similar style as that of KISQ (\\"Kiss FM\\") that was dropped in early 2016 when it flipped to Soft AC as The Breeze.

Kiril and Methodi) is the cathedral church and headquarters of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church Diocese of the United States, Canada, and Australia. The church is located at 552 West 50th Street, between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues, Hell's Kitchen / Clinton, Manhattan, New York City. The building is 100 feet long, 28 feet wide, and 25 feet high, with a yellow brick fa√ßade. In 1890 its site was occupied by a silk-ribbon factory. By 1899, the church was up, with an organ installed. In 1909 a Polish Catholic parish was formed, called St. Clemens Mary. (Clement Mary Hofbauer had been canonized on May 20, 1909.) It worshipped briefly in a candy store on 10th Avenue near 51st Street before renting the 50th Street church, which had been occupied by a Lutheran congregation. Meanwhile, its own new building was built at 410 West 40th Street, and completed in 1913. (Today it is the Metro Baptist Church.) On October 16, 1913, a Catholic parish was founded in Manhattan by Croatian Franciscan friars to serve Croatian immigrants. The Franciscans rented the 50th Street church. During a five-week renovation, German Franciscans from 31st St., a Slovak parish from Brooklyn, and a German church on 49th Street donated an altar, two statues, a chalice, books, garments for mass, and money. By early 1914, $21,000 was collected to purchase the church building, dedicating it to Saints Cyril and Methodius, ninth century Greek brothers recognized as saints by the Catholic Church in 1881. At that time the congregation numbered about 4,000. After 60 years, the Croatian congregation moved into the grander St. Raphael's Church at 502 West 41st Street in 1974, forming the merged parishes of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael, after which the 50th Street building stood empty for several years. In 1979 it was purchased by the Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Church, which retained the dedication to the Slavic patron saint, changing only the spelling. The cathedral had been at 312 West 101st Street for forty years. In 1982, a $500,000 interior renovation was undertaken, and the newly restored church was consecrated May 13, 1984.

It is intended to provide authentication of the communication partners, as well as data integrity and confidentiality. SMTPS is not a proprietary protocol and not an extension of SMTP. It is a way to secure SMTP at the transport layer, by wrapping SMTP inside TLS. Conceptually, it is similar to how HTTPS wraps HTTP inside TLS. This means that the client and server speak normal SMTP at the application layer, but the connection is secured by SSL or TLS. This happens when the TCP connection is established, before any mail data has been exchanged. Since whether or not to use SSL or TLS is not explicitly negotiated by the peers, services that speak SMTPS are usually reachable on a dedicated port of their own. Difference between SMTPS and smtps \\"smtps\\" is also the name of an IANA-registered service, with the TCP port number 465. The service was intended for use by Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), as a point of contact where these could exchange email in an encrypted form rather than in plaintext. The registration was quickly revoked however, as standardization efforts resulted in an alternate approach being standardized. The registration has never been reinstated. When describing the IANA service registration, the official capitalization is \\"smtps\\". When describing the network protocol, the capitalization \\"SMTPS\\" is often used (similar to how HTTPS is capitalized). Port 587 is the well-known port for submitting mail to a server, frequently (but not required to be) encrypted using STARTTLS. Some email service providers allow their customers to use the SMTPS protocol to access a TLS-encrypted version of the \\"submission\\" service on port 465. This is a different service from what the original IANA-registration dedicated the port to (for it used to be dedicated to encrypted content delivered as-is / in plain text, whereas nowadays' SMTPS on port 465 still uses plaintext content, only wrapped within TLS-encrypted transportation-basically the reverse mechanism). RFC 8314 aims to rectify this problem and integrate the use of port 465 as a TLS-encrypted \\"submission\\" port into the well-known port registrations published by IANA. The proposed service name is \\"submissions\\". While there is no longer any official registered endpoint for the smtps service, it is still possible to exchange email over an encrypted transport with similar guarantees as those offered by smtps, in particular with the guarantee that either the exchange succeeds securely, or does not happen at all, by using DANE in combination with DNSSEC. Many email servers are configured to either not deliver email securely at all, or to first try secure delivery with the STARTTLS mechanism, and if that fails, for example because the remote service does not offer it, or because a successful MITM-attack has stripped announcement of the feature, simply fall back to delivery by insecure means. History In early 1997, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority registered port 465 for smtps. Late 1998 this was revoked when STARTTLS was standardized. With STARTTLS, the same port can be used with or without TLS. The use of well-known ports for mail exchanges communicating with SMTP was discussed in particular at the time. Port 465 currently shows as registered for both Source-Specific Multicast and submissions. RFC 8314 \\"Cleartext Considered Obsolete: Use of TLS for Email Submission and Access\\" proposes to officially recognize port 465 for implicitly encrypted email submission.

The town began as a mining camp, as part of a gold rush, with allotments being made available in 1896. Alfred Edward Morgans, who later became Premier of Western Australia, established a short-lived copper smelter in the area in 1896. Town lots were sold in 1900 but the railway to Leonora, built in 1905, bypassed the townsite and the railway station was located north of the original townsite. The boundaries of the town were extended in 1906 to the include the railway station. All further development occurred alongside the railway line. A police station was opened in 1905, with building constructed in 1906 and then closed in 1911. The station was then reopened in 1943 and then closed again in 1951.

It is a rare cause of infant botulism, in which newborns or infants lose their muscle tone, and develop trouble feeding due to a difficulty in breathing, which can be fatal. Newborns can recover spontaneously or as in two known cases improve with injected botulism antitoxin. , the environmental source of this bacterium is unknown, despite extensive investigations when cases have occurred. It is named after Barat who is a French bacteriologist.lpsn.dsmz.de, list of prokaryotic names with standing nomenclature. Diagnosis The diagnosis must be suspected based on the constellation of symptoms. Clostridium baratii infection is proven when it is grown on a petri dish and isolated from a stool culture. This takes a minimum of 48 hours and more, because the bacterium needs to grow in the absence of oxygen, that is under anaerobic conditions. Symptoms and signs of infection Newborns symptoms are that they develop constipation, are fussy, and feed poorly. Signs of the disease reported by caregivers are \\"excessive crying, reluctance to suck, and difficulty in swallowing milk\\". Within hours an infant can become less responsive to stimuli and \\"floppy\\", that is its muscle tone diminishes. Epidemiology The CDC reported in 2015, that through 2013, only 14 cases of C. baratii type F infant botulism had been reported in the United States. As opposed to the classic cause of botulism, C. botulinum, its environmental source is unknown. Therefore, it is unclear how to prevention infection. When very young infants become floppy and their breathing fails (progressive respiratory failure) health care practitioners should consider this disease as a possible diagnosis.

His love of the islands was sparked as a U.S. Marine during World War II when he was posted to Samoa. After the war, he split his years between California and the Pacific, capturing the exoticism of island people and landscapes in oil on board and black velvet. Career Tyree was born in Irvine, Kentucky and moved to Delhi, California as an infant. He was awarded a scholarship to the California College of the Arts (Oakland) for a portrait he painted of his future wife, Marguerite (Margo) Almeida and also studied at the San Francisco School of Fine Arts. Seven weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor he joined the Marines. He trained at the base in San Diego before being shipped off to Samoa in the summer of 1942. Private Tyree was befriended by his Commanding General, Charles F.B. Price and became the Marine-base artist in Samoa. His portrait art career began by painting the officers and their loved ones, while corresponding with art infused love letters to his girlfriend Margo back home in Turlock, California. He returned to San Diego in April,1944 and was stationed at Camp Pendleton, Oceanside, CA . On June 27, 1945 Tyree married Margo. He was discharged from the service on January 24, 1946.Soon after Tyree started his family, and began his professional art career in central California. He and his family (Margo and eventually, seven children) traveled back to the South Pacific to live for years in places such as: Guam (1952‚Äì55), Oahu (1956‚Äì58), Maui (1964‚Äì65), and the Big Island of Hawaii (1968-1971). Often, from there, he would travel to other island paradises: Palau, Fiji, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Solomon Islands over his thirty-year career. He is best known for his nude and semi-nude paintings of women of the Pacific islands. Most of his first works were sensual island wahines in island beach and jungle settings. He painted primarily with oils on board but also occasionally on canvas and with pastels. To add depth and texture, he switched in mid-career (1960) to painting with oils on fine, French silk, black velvet. This was in the midst of the 1960s' Tiki revolution and many of his nude pieces would be displayed in Tiki bars and restaurants. In the 1970s, he started painting endangered animals to call attention to their limited numbers. Burke Tyree died at age 57 of a heart attack at his home in Crows Landing, California. During his career it is estimated that he painted more than 3,000 different pieces. References * Severson, Don R.

He was the son of the Moritz Georg Weidmann Senior. He entered the business in 1713 as a partner, and in 1717 took complete control of his father's bookstore, which his stepfather, Johann Ludwig Gleditsch, had managed for him since 1694. Moritz Georg Weidmann was born in 1686, son of the elder Moritz Georg Weidmann who died in 1693. The family firm of Weidmannsche Buchhandlung had been established in Frankfurt by his father in 1680, moving to Leipzig in 1681. Johann Ludwig Gleditsch, brother of Johann Friedrich Gleditsch, married his father's widow and built up the business of the house, while training the younger Moritz Georg to take over the business. Gleditsch published authors such as Wieland, Gellert, Lessing, Lavater and Heyne. The most significant achievement of the Gleditsch brothers was to persuade the leading Dutch booksellers to send their works to the Leipzig fair instead of to Frankfurt. After his stepson had taken control in 1717, Gleditsch withdrew from the book trade. Early in 1734, Weidmann introduced a magazine of news of the European states, Europ√§ischen Staats-Secretarius, in competition with Johann Heinrich Zedler's monthly Cabinet magazine. When Zedler attempted to boost sales through a book lottery, Weidmann was the leader of the booksellers opposing the innovation. Weidmannsche Buchhandlung continued to publish in Leipzig until 1854, reaching its height under Philipp Erasmus Reich, called the \\"nation's bookseller\\".

From the 1920s until 31 October 1931, the company operated route 130 from Central station to Maroubra Junction. The service was deemed to be in competition with government trams and was terminated under the State Transport (Co-ordination) Act. The company's main business was route 237, which operated between Central station and Brighton- Le-Sands via Darlinghurst, Kensington, Daceyville and Mascot. In 1931, route 237 was determined to be in competition with government trams under the State Transport (Co-ordination) Act. The service was re-licensed to operate a feeder service from Brighton-Le-Sands to Kensington, with some services extended to the factory complex at Raleigh Park. The feeder service was extended in 1933 to Ramsgate. On 8 December 1934, route 237 was taken over by the Department of Road Transport and Tramways and subsumed into its existing route 3 service.

Release and reception \\"Betty\\" was released as a digital download on 6 December 2010 in New Zealand. Christianity Today John Brandon noted \\"Betty\\" as one of the top tracks on Flags. Tom Cardy from The Dominion Post lauded its musical and lyrical depth, and Lindsay Whitfield of Soulshine praised its \\"catchy\\" rhythm. \\"Betty\\" entered the New Zealand Singles Chart at number thirty-eight on 24 January 2011, and remained in the position the next week. The song would go on to peak at number thirty in its third charting week, remaining on the charts for 5 weeks total. Music video The accompanying music video for \\"Betty\\" debuted on Nightline on 29 November 2010. The video takes place in an indoor flower garden. Fraser wears a strapless silver dress, black stockings and purple eye-shadow, with her hair tied in a bun. She dances among the garden, admiring the flowers. Origami birds are seen moving as though living amongst the flowers, and, in the chorus, surround Fraser. The video closes with Fraser observing a paper bird flying away.

The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino - poems and songs 1939‚Äì1945 () is the title of a collection of period works by Feliks Konarski (pseudonym: Ref-Ren). The book's title, \\"Czerwone Maki\\", is also the name of one of the most famous Polish songs to emerge from World War II.  Content  Konarski began to write poems and songs after a two-year break. This book contains the works written after Konarski joined the Polish Second Corps in December 1941. Konarski wrote a regular basis, but rarely published his works. The Polish Second Corps, led by General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, stormed the strategic Abbey on Monte Cassino. On the eve of this decisive battle, Konarski wrote the book's title work, \\"The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino\\". It has combative, and emotional words. The song became an unofficial national anthem during the communist occupation of Poland, and it was banned in that country during the 1950s. Konarski's works in this book are arranged as a chronicle of the tragic fate and the combat roles taken by the Polish Second Corps. The book's cover shows the image of the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa, a holy icon of the Virgin Mary, that is both Poland's holiest relic and one of the country's national symbols, looking over the remaining ruins of the famous Abbey of Monte Cassino after the battle.

The record was released through Epitaph Records on April 12, 2011, and it was Thursday's final album before their five-year breakup from 2011 to 2016. The musical style on No Devoluci√≥n is a departure from the more traditional post- hardcore sound on Thursday's earlier records, and instead explores darker and more atmospheric tones.  Writing and recording  Thursday entered Tarbox Road Studios in Fredonia, New York with producer Dave Fridmann in July 2010. Fridmann had previously produced the band's previous two studio albums: 2006's A City by the Light Divided and 2009's Common Existence. In a press release for the album, vocalist Geoff Rickly commented, \\"We've worked with Dave Fridmann before, but this is definitely the most we've ever clicked with him.\\" Fridmann was also inspired by the new direction Thursday was taking their music, and assisted the band in taking their music to new areas. Thursday entered the studio without any demos and impulsively wrote No Devoluci√≥n on the spot. Within a week the band had a full album written ‚Äî a dramatically shorter time frame for Thursday as their previous albums had taken between six months and a year to compose. In an effort to \\"[keep] the songs fresher,\\" recording was performed in several two-week periods with a month off in between sessions. The album's closing song \\"Stay True\\" was an improvised studio warm-up song based around a guitar part. Each day a new variation of the instrumental song was performed and recorded live, with some versions lasting up to 20 minutes. The nearly eight-minute track that appears on No Devoluci√≥n was Thursday's favorite version of the song, and vocals were later recorded for it. Rickly also recorded some of his vocal parts in the forest that surrounds Tarbox Road Studios.  Style and lyrics  Musically, the record has been described as being atmospheric, dark and moody. Unlike previous Thursday albums, Geoff Rickly did not compose any guitar parts for No Devoluci√≥n. He wanted to let the members \\"who actually do the playing on the album [take] charge,\\" and allow them to experiment with \\"new sounds and directions.\\" According to Rickly, each song on the album explores its own musical direction and \\"vibe\\" resulting in a collection of sonically diverse songs. The music is also a departure from the sound found on Thursday's earlier albums. This idea is supported by the album title which translates from Spanish to \\"no returns.\\" The vocal style has also evolved from previous Thursday albums. Rickly described his singing style as \\"desperate\\" and at the top of his range in the past, but for No Devoluci√≥n he gives a more \\"sung delivery\\" that better paired with \\"beautiful passages.\\" While writing for No Devoluci√≥n, Rickly's marriage was described as being \\"on the rocks,\\" which had an effect on some of the lyrics. All of the songs center themselves around the concept and theme of devotion. The song \\"No Answers\\" analyzes the difficulties in maintaining a friendship with a former lover. According to Rickly, after being in a relationship with someone for an extended period of time, \\"there's more important levels to the relationship than simple romance.\\" Another common lyrical theme on No Devoluci√≥n is how religious symbols can inadvertently divide the masses, which is most exemplified on the song \\"A Gun in the First Act.\\" The song \\"Stay True\\" was written about Touch√© Amor√©‚Äîa group that Rickly knows through his vinyl-only label, Collect Records. He stated, \\"In thinking about what I wish for them, their band and all the mistakes I hope they don't make I recalled all the mistakes I had made.\\" Rickly noted that the end of Turnpike Divides has a similar lyrical structure to Shudder to Think's \\"X-French Tee Shirt.\\" Rickly wanted to do a long, complex circular melody which Fridman noted was similar to what OK Go tried on another song.  Promotion and release  Image of the No Devoluci√≥n limited edition packaging. In early 2011, Thursday toured North America with Underoath. The tour marked the tenth anniversary for their second studio album Full Collapse, which was performed in its entirety on all dates in celebration. A 7\\" vinyl split single featuring Underoath's \\"Paper Lung\\" from their 2010 album √ò (Disambiguation) and Thursday's \\"Past and Future Ruins\\" from their No Devoluci√≥n was released as a tour-exclusive item in limited quantities. Also during this tour, Thursday held a contest in which six winners were chosen per tour date to preview select songs from No Devoluci√≥n. On February 1, 2011 the song \\"Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart\\" was digitally previewed via online streaming with a video directed and produced by Davy and Kristin McGuire. Thursday intentionally selected this song to preview first because it was the most radically different song off of No Devoluci√≥n when compared to their older material. Geoff Rickly described releasing a heavier song as \\"false advertising,\\" and by releasing \\"Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart\\" the group would send the message to their fans: \\"You're not going to get the record you think you're going to get.\\" The song \\"Past and Future Ruins\\" became available for online streaming on February 22, 2011, and \\"No Answers\\" became available the following month on March 22. No Devoluci√≥n was released on April 12, 2011 through Epitaph Records in CD, 2√óLP and digital formats. There was also a limited edition CD version designed by paper craft artist Mia Pearlman, who also created the art that was used for the packaging of the standard releases. The limited edition features layers of solid bleached sulphate paper with a different laser cut design on each layer to where \\"light will shine through the CD hole.\\" It was limited to 500 pieces and individually hand signed and numbered by Pearlman.  Reception  No Devoluci√≥n received universal critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\", based on 12 ratings. Adam Thomas of Sputnikmusic declared that \\"by combining these previously worked on sounds in new ways Thursday have created an album that is not only new and unique, but also unmistakably their own.\\" Jason Heller of The A.V. Club stated that \\"No Devoluci√≥n isn‚Äôt a return to form for Thursday; it‚Äôs a searing, scarring reinvention.\\" The album was listed at #22 on Sputnikmusic's year-end Staff's Top 50 Albums of 2011.

Atlantic Coast Hockey League Selenski got his start as a coach and general manager with the Troy Slapshots of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League. The Slapshots would see limited action in the ACHL, playing only six games before being suspended by ACHL Commissioner Ray Miron. Shortly after the leaguewide dispersal draft, the Mohawk Valley Comets would fire their coach (Bill Horton) and replace him with Selenski, who assumed the dual role of coach and general manager. The Comets would go 22-22-3 under Selenski and make the playoffs. However, the Comets would eventually lose to the Virginia Lancers four games to three in the Payne Trophy Finals. After the completion of the 1986-87 ACHL season, the Comets transferred to the AHL and were later rebranded as the Utica Devils, and the ACHL was folded by Commissioner Ray Miron. All-American Hockey League Without a team to coach at the start of the 1987-88 season, Selenski headed to Johnstown to negotiate the foundation of a hockey team in the newly formed All-American Hockey League. On December 27, 1987, Selenski - along with future team owner Henry Brabham - walked into Dennis Grenell's office at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena and inquired about potentially putting a new franchise in Johnstown. Selenski expected to be able to field team by the start of the following season, but Grenell said he wanted a team \\"right now\\". Within two weeks, Selenski was able to find uniforms from a Canadian vendor and field a team based on old players who he had coached while in the ACHL. The Chiefs went 13-13-0 in the regular season and qualified for the playoffs, but would eventually lose to the Carolina Thunderbirds. Selenski was not re-signed after the post-season. ECHL Selenski was brought in as a midseason replacement for Carolina Thunderbirds' head coach Brian Carroll. Despite finishing with a sub-.500 record, Selenski would lead the Thunderbirds to the playoffs and would eventually defeat the Johnstown Chiefs in a seven-game Riley Cup Final. While in Carolina, Selenski coached several players who would reach the NHL in various capacities. Forward Bill Huard would later go on to play over 200 games in the NHL with five different teams. Scott Allen would later coach in the ECHL and AHL for 13 years before assuming the position of Assistant Coach for the New York Islanders at the start of the 2010-11 NHL season.

The protected area was established with the focus on conservation of the native flora and fauna, and preservation of the geological features in the Jacksons Creek, a part of the valley, north-west of Melbourne. It is situated in a deep gorge in the grassy, basalt Keilor Plains. Within Organ Pipes National Park, the valley walls of Jacksons Creek expose Pleistocene volcanic rocks of the New Volcanic Group. These 2.5 to 2.8 million year-old basalt lavas, commonly known as trap rock, fractured during cooling into vertically standing, hexagonal basalt columns. These columns are locally known as the \\"organ pipes\\" for which this park is named. Over the last one to two million years, the slow cutting by Jackson Creek of its valley down into the basaltic plains and through the underlying trap rock exposed these geological structures. The bottom of the valley of Jackson Creek also exposes a prehistoric buried creek valley, which is cut into 400 million year-old (Silurian) mudstones and sandstones. The bottom of this buried valley contains ancient creek gravel. Both the ancient river valley and the Silurian sedimentary rock lies buried beneath the basaltic volcanic rocks of the New Volcanic Group. Marine fossils found in the Silurian sedimentary rocks demonstrate that they accumulated beneath a prehistoric ocean. A Friends' group, (the first in Australia) the \\"Friends of Organ Pipes\\" (FOOPS), comprising conservation activists to support the efforts of rehabilitation of the OPNP's indigenous flora and fauna, supplemented the work of the Victoria Park system under which the OPNP was declared a National Park. The park's importance to the whole region as a \\"center for education about the geology, flora and fauna of the Keilor Plains, and the restoration of degraded land\\" is important. With its inclusion in the IUCN Category III (Natural Monuments) of the United Nations' list of National Parks and Protected Areas, there is a greater recognition of the need to protect or preserve outstanding natural features. Geography The Maribyrnong River as it flows past the Melbourne suburb of The national park, designated to cover an area of , is situated to the northwest of Melbourne city. It is part of the Victoria Park system. It is approachable from the Calder Highway. The road network around the park consists of the Calder Highway on the south and the Calder Raceway also on the southern direction but close to its entrance. The Jacksons Creek, which is at the heart of the park, is bounded by the city of Hume on the northern side while the city of Brimbank is to its south; Deep Creek and Keilor Plains to the west of Melbourne are also part of this geographical setting. The complementary areas to the park are the Holden Flora Reserve (), Holden School Site (), Derrimut Grassland Reserve () and Laverton and North Grassland Reserve (). Out of the total area of , the conservation area is (88.6%), conservation and recreation area is (10.8%), visitor center accounts for (0.6%), and (1.6%) is the special management area. The park is drained by Jacksons Creek. This with Deep Creek and Mount Emu creek are the major tributaries of the Maribyrnong River, which has a catchment area of . Jackson Creek rises in the Wombat State Forest, flows east to the Roslynn Reservoir, joining Deep Creek near Sydenham Park. It outflows from the reservoir through Gisborne, Sunbury before flowing through Organ Pipes National Park. Climate The park lies in a rain shadow area. According to records maintained at the Melbourne Airport since 1972, the average annual rainfall in the park area is (occurs during winter and spring). Occasionally, heavy rainfall occurs in the area and one such event caused heavy floods during winter in the flood plains of Maribyrnong, in September 1993, causing loss of vegetation, destroying the viewing platform and also scouring the banks of the creek. History =Early period= The earliest settlers in the plains of the park area and its vicinity were the Australian Aboriginal Woiworung people of the Kulin nation in the Yarra and Maribyrnong River valleys. Jackson Creek formed part of the boundary between two clan estates, Marin‚ÄìBulluk and Wurundjeri‚ÄìWillam. They were farmers and hunters who lived on the forest products and harvested grass species and spear grass (Stipa spp.) that were grown and regrown in the area of the Keilor Plains after burning every year. The climate and rainfall also favoured growth of native grasses in the rolling plains. Animal species such as kangaroos, dingoes, tiger, bandicoots, gliders and platypuses were common. Bird species of cockatoos, kookaburras, quails, finches and hawks also flourished. The vegetation was lush with grass lands and plenty of plants with flowering blooms. Their habitation of the area is established by archaeological findings in the area in the form of their campsites and isolated artefacts within the park. The environment along Jackson Creek environment facilitated shelter, water and plentiful food for their original settlement. =European settlers' period= In early 19th century, Europeans from Tasmania started settling in the area. They were chiefly responsible for introducing several species of exotic plants and animals into the area as they found the terrain to be drab and filled with strange animals like kangaroo. They introduced new variety of plants such as boxthorn hedges for fences and trees such as oaks, willows and pine, creating an ambiance of their homeland. Kangaroos were hunted, rabbits and furred animals were killed for their valuable skin. This had ill effects on the native vegetation and faunal species. So much so that \\"high artichoke thistles blanketed the creek flats and slopes, horehound had spread everywhere, boxthorn bushes crowded the slopes and plains, and other weed species filled the gaps. Erosion gullies scarred the steep slopes. Rubbish was piled here and there\\". During this period, there was a hamlet near the Organ Pipes and a suspension bridge across Jacksons Creek to reach a school and farm lands that surrounded the village. The Hall family lived here between 1870 and the 1920s; their plum tree orchards still exist. The European settlers' period is also borne out by archaeological artefacts in the form of bluestone walls. The stables in the park area were built by the Halls in which the Hayes family lived, and a Jackson Bay fig tree is located near the Information Center. The Bartlett family lived here from 1934 to 1948 and the last owner was E. A. Green. His estate became the property of Stan Payne which was eventually donated to the Organ Pipes National Park in 1972. =National Park period= Consequent to the deterioration of the environmental conditions, the well- meaning, environmentally conscious citizens decided to rehabilitate the environment by reinvigorating the area. The first step towards this end was initiated by the National Park Service in 1972 by declaring initially an area of of the land donated by the E. A. Green Charitable Foundation as a national park. Under Schedule2 of The National Parks Act 1971 (Vic.), the area was declared as National Park on 12 March 1972. There were several objectives of this declaration, but the intent was to restore the park with both direct and indirect interventions to improve the ecosystem. Direct intervention came in the form of planting indigenous species as seedlings, and indirect format was to de-weed the area. As a result, the overstorey plants of indigenous variety and understorey species are now well established. An area of of land was added under the National Parks (Amendment) Act 1978 (Vic.) and another of Crown land (including land acquired previously forcibly for the Park) was added on 4June 1997. The National Parks Act enjoins on the Director of the park \\"to preserve and protect the natural environment of the Park, and its natural and other features.\\" It also stipulates the use of the park by the public for enjoyment, recreation and education, apart from the needed research. The Park Regulations 1992 Section4 (Objects) is related to visitor activities and Section 17 of the National Parks Act governs the management of the Park. The Park is also reserved as a \\"Geological Monument\\" under the final recommendations for the Melbourne Study Area (LCC 1977) and also continues as a National Park for the Melbourne Area District1 Review (LCC 1987). Fire Protection Plan, Port Phillip Area (former Melbourne Region) (CNR 1996); Draft Conservation Program for Native Grasslands and Grassy Woodlands in Victoria (CNR 1992) and Code of Practice for Fire Management on Public Land (CNR 1995) are some of the other legalese connected with the park. The particular site was chosen because of the presence of several interesting geological features, including the \\"Organ Pipes\\", themselves a pattern of vertical pipe-like rock structures exposed by the erosion of the creek, and a tessellated pavement, where the rock surface has been split into regular \\"tiles\\" by joints related to columnar jointing. Geological formations The Keilor Plains, where the geomorphological and geological features of heritage value are located, is part of the greater Western Volcanic Plains which cover a large part of western Victoria and extend into south-eastern South Australia and are stated to be the third largest lava plains in the world. These landforms were created by the incision of the Jacksons Creek into thick lava flows that erupted about 2.5 to 2.8 million years ago during the Pleistocene Period. These lavas overlie steeply dipping Silurian sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rock and fossils found in the park are also dated back 400 million years, an indication that the area was once a sea. The rocks seen in the park have mostly dark grey or brown colour. Graptolites are seen as fossils of sea snails, sea worms and extinct floating animals in the rocks here. About 2.5 to 2.8 million years ago giant lava flows known as a flood basalt spread across the land from surrounding volcanoes. Rock exposures of Silurian mudstones and jointed structural features of basalt are spread at many locations in the form of Basalt cliffs, boulder screes and sedimentary escarpments. The geological features in the Park, all of volcanic origin, have been categorized under the broad heads namely, the Organ Pipes, Tessellated Pavement, Rosette Rock, Scoria cone and the Sandstone layer. =Organ Pipes= \\"Organ Pipe\\" Geological Formations Jackson Creek, which meets with Deep Creek to become the Maribyrnong River, has slowly worn a deep valley in the basaltic plain formation of hard, dark rock revealing the old volcanic geological formations such as the hexagonal basalt columns known as the \\"Organ Pipes\\"; the lava deposit in the bed of the creek is of the order of . As the lava cooled over several years the interior molten lava got insulated and developed into undisturbed columns of basalt (with uniform composition) as the lava heat dissipated. The cooling effect caused shrinkage and as scientifically elaborated: :\\"This shrinkage caused tension in the rock mass. Vertical (upward and downward) tension could be accommodated by the elastic molten rock beneath but horizontal tension could not be relieved and so the basalt cracked. The rock usually cracks in a hexagonal pattern (six sides), but columns with up to eight sides are found. The rock was still hot (about ) when the columns were formed. Further contraction took place as the rock lost its remaining heat; this was relieved by horizontal cracking, causing some columns to look like stacks of Dutch cheese.\\" As seen now, the rock formation rises to a height of and is considered as the best example of columnar jointing in Victoria. The unusual shape of Jackson Creek Organ Pipes is attributed to the columnar structure which is rare and occurred at strategic location where the down cutting action of the stream created the post-volcanic valley. The Organ Pipes is so named as it resembles a pipe organ. The width of each pipe in the formation is about ; only some of the columns are vertical while most other smaller columns around the Pipes are either inclined or horizontal. =Tessellated pavement= Tessellated pavement is an assortment of basalt columns that evolved as a result of erosion by the Jackson Creek, which is seen in the form of pavements about 250 meters upstream of the Rosette Rock. Frequent access to this formation is likely to cause deterioration of this formation. =Rosette rock= Rosette rock is a radial array of basalt columns. Rosette rock formation seen about upstream of the Organ Pipes is an overhanging rock on the northern bank of the stream. It is also an outcrop of basalt but with a radial array of columns akin to the spokes of a giant wheel. Its formation is attributed to the cooling of \\"a pocket of lava, probably in a spherical cave formed from an earlier lava flow\\". =Sandstone layer= The sandstone layer seen in the Jackson Creek has been dated to about 400 million years old. They are made of quartz and quartzite gravel, and are located midway between the car park and the Organ Pipes. They are stated to be part of a deep lead‚Äîan ancient stream bed buried by a lava flow, and later revealed by the downcutting of Jackson Creek. Deep leads were mined for gold in Ballarat during the Gold Rushes. =Soils= The volcanic soils in the park formed above basaltic rock base are found in the valleys and have gentle or flat slopes. Soil types have been classified as zonal types comprising red-brown earths (dominant type in the park with low permeability), grey duplex soils in flat areas (with high permeability) and uniform medium loams (on steep slopes on the southern direction of shallow depth and well drained); azonal soil types consisting of alluvial soils (fertile soils in the park consisting of clay loams to gravels suitable to grow tolerant plant species like river red gum and river bottle-brush), colluvial soils (at the toe of steep slopes of dark grey to dark brown in colour, suitable to grow wide variety of vegetation) and lithosols (reddish brown soils on steep slopes and frequently support boxthorn and indigenous lightwoods (Acacia implexa); and other lithosols which are pre-basaltic sands and gravels seen near the foot of Grey Box Gully and in lower slopes of the Jacksons Creek valley. Soils in the park have been subject to erosion, weed growth, human activity and animal burrowing, particularly by rabbits. They are generally found not suitable for plant growth due to their poor water holding property. The degradation of the soils has been arrested with extensive re vegetation. Flora Intense propagation of vegetation of native species, in an otherwise plain degraded area infested with weeds (semblance of native vegetation seen mainly as thistles and boxthorns), started from the time of declaring the area as a national park in 1972. Work continued to remove introduced plants and vermin, and reintroduce natural vegetation and wildlife to the park. As of 2002, large areas of trees and shrubbery began to be re- established, systematic planting of native grass, plants and trees was started, which has created large swathes of kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra). The effect of the revegetation project in progress for now more than two decades has created a variety of ecosystems. Seven types of wattle were seen blooming at one time and many other indigenous plants. Six types of vegetation witnessed, consequent to the re-vegetation programme launched by the Park Administration with assistance from FOOPS, are in three landform zones reflecting the soils derived from the underlying geology. These landforms are the plains and the escarpment. The overall picture of floral abundance that has emerged after the area was declared a national park is identification of 124 indigenous plant species including more than 20 species which are in the category of rare or threatened or significant. Some of the significantly recreated basalt plain grassland plants are: Chloris truncata (windmill grass‚Äînative species), Bothriochloa macra (or redleg grass which are red or purplish colour that grow in late summer), Danthonia species or wallaby grasses (important native pasture grasses), Dicanthium sericeum (silky bluegrass), Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass, a high protein grass), Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides (button wrinklewort‚Äîan endangered species) and Callitris glaucophylla (white cypress-pine or Murray pine). On the banks of the valley formed by Jacksons Creek are found stray examples of remnant indigenous vegetation including river red gum riparian woodland (also manna gum and blackwood species), reed bed and sedgeland species and also shrub land and grasslands. The population of Callitris glaucophylla is one of only two found near Melbourne. Silky blue grass and red-leg grass are also noted in the park area adjoining the Sydenham Park. The impact of the natural vegetation growth, however, is the loss of visibility of the geological formations. Fauna The diverse faunal significance of the OPNP is evident in the riparian, escarpment and grassland environments in the park. The faunal species found in the OPNP range from birds, mammals (such as eastern grey kangaroo, swamp wallaby), reptiles (including long-necked tortoise, the eastern bearded dragon, and the red-bellied black snake), and echidnas. With the park's programme of intensive induction of native vegetation in the area, several faunal species also started to proliferate. A 1988 mammal survey conducted at OPNP by the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research found bats to be the most diverse group of native mammals in occurrence. A very successful bat roosting box project has been underway for twenty years. Avifaunal species (such as the wedge-tailed eagle) are proliferating. Growling grass frog, and many indigenous fish species (such as the mountain galaxias) have also reappeared. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) which was previously in the OPNP in 1916 was relocated into the park in 1989 from Toolern Vale. This is one of many projects run by the Friends of the Organ Pipes National Park. Overall, OPNP authorities have reported 15 mammal native species, 88 species of avifauna, 13 reptile species and six amphibian species. Management plan A Management Plan was approved by the Conservation and Management of Parks, Victoria under Section 17 of the National Parks Act 1975 (Vic.), in 1996, with the objective of conserving nature and to provide exposure to the public at large to the natural and cultural heritages of the national parks as also promote tourism. For this purpose, the park has been divided into management zones to provide a geographical context to manage the park, appropriate actions to be taken to meet the specific requirements of the zones, avoid any conflicting actions and review the progress achieved from time to time. Some of the set management actions taken over the years to bring in a change from a degraded ecosystem to a near natural ecosystem are: Weed control through mechanical and chemical methods with occasional use of fire; removal of noxious weeds, vermin control, check on growth of rabbits, and rehabilitation of degraded land through a major re-vegetation programme with erosion control, maintaining seed banks and nurseries. An Information Center, maintained by the Park Administration in the park precincts, disseminates information on the volcanic formations in the park, aboriginals who lived in the area, about early European settlements, the re-vegetation project of the once degraded park and its role among national parks in conservation and preservation of the ecology of the area. Attractions The park is also a popular tourist destination as it houses the Organ Pipes, The Tessellated Pavement, the Rosette Rock and much more. There is a Visitors Center and picnic area next to the car park and short walking tracks down a rather steep hill to Jacksons Creek and the rock features. The park is under the flight path of Melbourne Airport and adjacent to the Calder Park Raceway so aircraft and/or motor sport noise can be a feature of a visit. The birds and other animals seem to be unaffected by this and an early morning or dusk visit will be rewarded by sightings of swamp wallabies and eastern grey kangaroos.

In addition to normal concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as the Reading Festival in 1983 and Montreux Jazz Festival in 1985, as well as many other one-off performances including Carnegie Hall. Critical and commercial response to Double Trouble live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to Vaughan's aggressive on-stage intensity as a high point. In total, the band have performed 834 shows throughout their career. Vaughan performed on all Double Trouble studio material until his death in 1990, with occasional instrumental contributions from other musicians. However, Vaughan has assembled groups of musicians to interpret songs for special live performances. While Vaughan controlled the creative and musical direction of Double Trouble in the studio, his guitar solos differed for every live performance. Several of the band's performances have been chronicled on live albums and videos. History =Texas Flood Tour (1983)= After the 1983 release of Texas Flood, Double Trouble embarked on the Texas Flood Tour in support of the album. The tour began with a series of small club performances in mid-1983. Double Trouble toured North America as an opening act for The Moody Blues in October through November 1983; for these performances, the band received $5,000 per show and a bonus for successful ticket sales. Double Trouble received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values. The tour included a performance on Austin City Limits, which was broadcast for PBS on February 28, 1984. The band also performed a sold-out show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Variety described the performance by calling Vaughan \\"the guitar hero of the present era\\". =Couldn't Stand the Weather Tour (1984)= In support of Double Trouble's second full-length studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, the band embarked on the Couldn't Stand the Weather Tour, which began in January 1984 and ran until the end of the year. Destinations included North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. During the European, Double Trouble performed at the Lorelei open-air theatre in Germany broadcast on Rockpalast, which had a television audience of an estimated forty-one million. The tour included a sold-out performance at Carnegie Hall and featured many special guests including the Roomful of Blues horn section, Dr. John, Jimmie Vaughan, Angela Strehli, and George Rains. Double Trouble's record label, Epic Records, reportedly refused to film the concert for financial reasons. Epic instead recorded the entire show, posthumously released as Live at Carnegie Hall. The band followed with a tour in Australia and New Zealand, performing two shows at the Sydney Opera House, then concluded with a final leg in North America. =Japan Tour 1985= In January 1985, Vaughan and Double Trouble went on their first tour of Japan. They performed at concert halls in Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo. On January 24, a show at Yubin Chokin Hall in Tokyo was filmed by Black Box Incorporated. A video of the show was later released as Live in Tokyo in 2007. The band also appeared on Japanese television, where Vaughan played a then-new composition named \\"Our Riviera Paradise\\"; the composition was later shortened to \\"Riviera Paradise\\" and included on the In Step album. =Soul to Soul Tour (1985-1986)= Following the recordings of Soul to Soul in March 1985, the band went back on the road for the Soul to Soul Tour. The tour began with a performance at Isla Blanca Park on South Padre Island for a spring break concert (The Isla Blanca Park show was March 19, 1987 - power problems led to SRV going acoustic through an open mic for part of the set.) At the band's next show in Manor Downs, Vaughan was named an honorary admiral of the Texas Navy by then-governor of Texas Mark White. This initial leg of the tour also included performances in Canada, performing at venues such as Massey Hall and Oshawa Civic Auditorium. The band followed with a brief leg in the United States in April, appearing at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Since the final formation of Double Trouble in 1981, Vaughan wanted to expand the band, hiring Reese Wynans as their full-time keyboardist. Wynans had previously been a member of Delbert McClinton's band and had also played with Jerry Jeff Walker. He began touring with Vaughan and Double Trouble in June. The band was also a part of the Chicago Blues Festival. They were presented with Grammy Awards for Best Traditional Blues Album on their performance of \\"Texas Flood\\" at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

He has been part of various rock outfits for the last 2 decades with varying degree of commercial success. Currently, he is a part of multiple projects, from his award-winning band 'kW and the Facedown Movement' (kW & FDM) to guitar instrumentals, video logs, Facebook live jams and collaboration with various internationally renowned musicians.http://khurram-waqar.com Earlier in 2019, kW & FDM won rock song of the year for 'Todi, the Smoker'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G6f3qZ75Y at the annual Video Music Awards (VIMA)https://www.facebook.com/VimaMusicAwards beating bands from countries such as India, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/440766-kw-the- facedown-movement-win-rock-song-of-the-year-at-vima-awards Previously, as part of the rock outfit Qayaas, he won Best Rock Band (Pakistan) at the Rolling Stones/Jack Daniels Annual Music Awards in 2010 and also won big at the IndieGO awards held in Malaysia in 2012.  Personal life  Born into a Punjabi Jatt family, Waqar grew up in Lahore, Pindi and Islamabad. His father is a retired bureaucrathttps://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/658503-ahmad- waqar-new-fbr-chairman and his mother is a housewife. He has a younger brother and a sister. While appreciative of the arts in general, no one from his family had ever ventured into the field of music. His parents were supportive of his passion under the condition that he pursue his studies and career in parallel. Khurram did exactly that, graduating from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a Masters in Information Systems Management.https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management- master/16-month Since 2002, he has managed a full-time IT/telecom career (works at Afiniti) along with his musical ventures. https://pk.linkedin.com/in/kwaqar He is married and has two sons and a daughter.https://www.facebook.com/khurram.waqar Musical Influences As a school boy, Khurram picked up the guitar due to the magic woven by the music of Guns N%27 Roses and Slash's guitar skills in particular. This was well before the Internet era and rock music did not have many takers in Pakistan. Inspired by his guitar idols Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, Khurram's undertook an entirely self taught journey towards the realisation of his musical goals. Initially he was predominantly influenced by Western rock and roll, being an avid fan of Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Whitesnake, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden in particular. Over the years, however, he has absorbed a wide range of influences including Indian classical and semi classical music. This has imparted his musical repertoire with versatility and resulted in a sound that is not mere 'fusion' but a collaborative collage of different musical cultures.  Current ventures  kW (2018-present) While he has actively been part of various rock outfits since 1992, Khurram has also dabbled in solo guitar instrumentals in parallel, that has, over the years, resulted in a considerable body of work. A few instrumentals were released sporadically but the vast majority of these instrumentals lay unfinished. In 2018, however, Khurram retrieved all the material from the vaults and subjected it to the painstaking process of production, mixing and mastering. The result, thereof, is an instrumental album which is ready for release in the latter half of 2019.http://khurram-waqar.com/my-projects The first instrumental from the upcoming (yet unnamed) album I'll be with youhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic0XeSiMfno was released in December 2018.https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/469003-khurram-waqar- unveils-new-solo-single It was an entirely independent initiative, every aspect of which was helmed by Khurram from the songwriting and music production to the hitherto untested waters of video direction, editing and production. In Khurram's own words 'This is a guitar instrumental and the idea originated almost 14 years ago when my eldest son was born. Now, this is for my three kids . They have been a part of the journey of the idea from inception to finish line. This is a completely independent initiative and I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to do it on my own' \\"Stick Together\\",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaebrvDPFxU the second instrumental was released during the Cricket World Cup 2019 to support the Pakistani cricket team in their quest for the top cricketing honour. Like \\"I'll be with you\\" before it, \\"Stick Together\\" was also entirely a one-man show. As Khurram puts it: \\"This is my instrumental for the love of Cricket and the ongoing Cricket World Cup with well wishes to our unpredictable and talented team. To me, the process of doing everything on my own is not only personally satisfying but also therapeutic.\\" kW and the Facedown Movement (2014-present) kW and the Facedown Movement (kW & FDM) is a rock band founded in 2014 with Khurram yet again donning the multiple hats of guitarist, songwriter and producer, accompanied by good friends Solomon and Kami on the vocals and drums respectively.http://facedownmovement.com/ The band's rather unusual name refers to the members' complete belief in themselves, immersed heart and soul, or literally face down, into their art; original, off beat and totally independent. The band's off beat approach and the music generated as a result thereof was validated when their song 'Todi, the Smoker' won 'Rock Song of the Year' at the annual Video Music Awards (VIMA) 2019, beating bands from countries such as India, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. In June 2019, the band released their debut EP called 'Facedown' which is available on iTunes,https://music.apple.com/us/album/facedown- ep/1467670608?app=itunes&ign-mpt;=uo%3D4 Amazon Music,https://music.amazon.com/artists/B07SWY24MP?tab=CATALOG&ref;=dm_wcp_artist_link_pr_s and bandcamp.https://kwandthefacedownmovement.bandcamp.com/album/facedown It features the following original numbers: 1\\\\. Facedown 2\\\\. Painted Grey 3\\\\. Into The Light 4\\\\. Bend It 5\\\\. Time 6\\\\. Todi, the Smoker Of these, videos were released for the singles 'Bend It',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mxCUbmA9EU&index;=3&t;=0s 'Time'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlsLa1K-fHs&index;=3 and 'Todi the Smoker'.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G6f3qZ75Y&index;=2&t;=0s The EP had another major distinction to its credit. It was the first time a Pakistani band had had its music mastered by the internationally renowned music producers Ryan Smithhttps://sterling-sound.com/engineer/ryan-smith/ and Ted Jensenhttps://sterling-sound.com/engineer/ted-jensen/ of Sterling Studio, New York City.https://sterling-sound.com/ Currently the band is working on new material to be released in the coming months. Collaborative Ventures (2018-present) Bazm e Rang' (2019) 'Bazm-e- Rang'http://www.bazmerang.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVdPJXa75bs is the brain child of Sarang Latif, son of Madam Abida Parveen, legendary Sufi singer, and a living Sufi herself. The main concept of the programme is to get artists from various genres and musical influences to give voice to Sufi kalam curated by Abida Jee and also set to music by her. Bazm-e-Rang has compositions by Abida jee from Kalams of legendary Sufi poets like Baba Bulleh Shah, Shah Niaz Barelvi, Bedam Shah Warsi, Amir Khusro and Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai.https://pakmediarevolution.pk/2019/05/witness-colours-of-sufism-with- sarang-latifs-bazm-e-rang While working with Madam Abida for 'Bazm e Rang'https://www.facebook.com/pg/KhayalSayKhayalTak/about/?ref=page_internal Khurram found her to be, \\"the true essence of a sufi soul in both her life and music. You feel at ease and peace just by sitting with her and conversing on life and music. This project called \\"Bazm e Rang\\" is an initiative by her son Sarang Latif and also features other artists. The promo has been released. My collaboration called\\" Ranjhay Bina\\" is a 15 min sojourn into mysticism and the love of Maula. I have learnt a lot at a spiritual level than a musical level while producing the track and playing in it.\\" kW & Nikhil (2018‚Äìpresent) In 2018 Khurram collaborated with Dubai-based musician Nikhil Raj Uzgare who is the vocalist of the award-winning rock band, Point of View,https://www.facebook.com/pointofviewdubai based in Dubai. Their collaboration resulted in the soft ballad 'Baatein',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKoCEAOY-O0https://patari.pk/home/song/kW- and-Nikhil-Baatein ostensibly far removed from the progressive rock sound of Khurram's other ventures but executed with the same degree of passion and attention to detail. The whole process was a unique experience, entailing cross geographical digital exchange of musical notes, long distance recordings and finally the in-person meeting in Dubai to shoot the video 'guerrilla style'. The Dubai meet culminated in a spontaneous acoustic gig before the video release. In the process, Khurram and Nikhil became good friends and are all set to release more songs in the near future. With Taimur Khan and Sarfaraz Khan (2019) Of late, Khurram has regularly contributed his guitar skills in jams featuring Taimur Khanhttps://sarangi.info/author/taimur/ on sarangi and Sarfaraz Khan on tabla, among the country's finest on their respective instruments. They have presented their own take on Raag Charukeshi, Raag Basant Mukhari, Raag Multani and Raag Bhairon as Facebook live sessions with many more collaborations in the pipeline.  Past ventures  Fantazia the Band (1992‚Äì96) The first band Khurram ever featured in, was 'Fantazia' with school mates and good friends Suhaib Kiani, Taimur Khan and Sabih Zaman. The band performed covers as well as original music in several gigs performed around Rawalpindi and Islamabad. In Lahore: Entity and kNuMb (1996‚Äì2001) Lahore of the mid and late 90s had a vibrant underground music culture and was referred to as a 'contemporary rock hub'https://tribune.com.pk/story/165754/lahores-underground-scene-crumbling- rock/ During this time Khurram was part of various rock bands that had a cult following. Initially he played a few gigs with Coven the band when their guitarist Hamza Jafrihttp://www.cokestudio.com.pk/mobile/season7/hamza- jafri.html left for London. During this time he struck a lifelong friendship with Ali Noor,Noori Ali JafriRushk and Abid Khan. Then came his stint with 'Entity' (later Entity Paradigm), featuring Ahmad Ali Butt,Ahmad Ali Butt Qasim Khan and Salman Albert. Qasim and Khurram were to form kNuMbhttp://knumb.com/ in late 90s. kNuMb played a mix of guitar instrumentals and original songs in gigs around the country. In 2001 Khurram left for the US to pursue his graduate studies. In Pittsburgh (2000‚Äì02) While in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States to pursue his master's degree in Information Systems Management, Waqar formed an instrumental band 'Cocytus' with a group of fellow CMU students. The band was multicultural and multi- ethnic in nature, with Rodrigo Escobar, the bassist, hailing from Chile; Frank Boucamp, the rhythm guitarist, from Germany; and Ammar, the drummer, an American of Indian origin. Cocytus performed in and around the university and had a few gigs in local bars and discos. While in Pittsburgh, Waqar also participated in a nationwide talent hunt called Guitarmageddon, and made it to the Pittsburgh finals. kNuMb (2003‚Äì08) Upon his return from the US, kNuMb rebanded with Waqar on the lead guitars, Qasim on vocals, Faraz on bass, Abdul Ahad on rhythms and Sharjeel on drums, to be later replaced by Kami. At that time, music and arts in Pakistan were experiencing an unprecedented boom and the music scene was particularly vibrant. kNuMb performed concerts in Islamabad and Lahore. kNuMb's hallmark became their mixed set of instrumentals as well as originals like Anjaani Rahain, Lamhe and Majhi, while their covers of Audioslave were particularly well liked. Around this time a couple of Steve Vai-Joe Satriani inspired G3 concerts were arranged by fans, in which Waqar performed alongside eminent guitarists like Faraz Anwar, Sarmad Ghafoor and Zeejah Fazli. Establishing the Rootgate Studio In 2003, Khurram set up a home based music studio called the Root Gate Studio with the facility to record live drums. All of kNuMb's material, 70% of Qayaas' album Uss Paar and all of KW's recorded music since has been recorded there. Despite state of the art equipment, the studio is meant only for personal jams and recordings. Qayaas (2008‚Äì2014) In 2008, Khurram formed the rock band Qayaas with Umair Jaswal on vocals which, over the years, developed a cult following. The band received Best Rock Band (Pakistan) award at the 2010 Rolling Stone-Jack Daniel's annual rock awards including Best Rock Band (Pakistan). They also won big at IndieGO, held in Malaysia in 2012. In the same year, their song \\"Charkha Naulakha\\" featured in Coke Studio Pakistan. The song also featured in a special limited-edition CD of 'Coke Studio's Greatest Hits' and currently has more than 4 million views on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8qU0VcbhBY Their debut album, Uss Paar, featuring 13 original songs, was released in 2011 to immense critical acclaim.

On New Year's Eve of 1994, Nanao decided to write music, by humming tunes and writing down lyrics, and throughout the next year began writing songs daily. After copying the styles of several bands he enjoyed, Nanao found songwriting a spontaneous activity. In 1996, after a year of high school, Nanao decided to drop out of high school, and in September took a friend's acoustic guitar and multitrack recorder and moved to Tokyo. In a year's time in 1997, Nanao sent in a demo tape for the Sony Soytzer Music Audition, which led to Nanao being signed to Sony. Nanao's initial recordings were in Los Angeles in March and July 1998, where he bought acoustic and electric guitars. In September, Nanao debuted with the single \\"Omoide Over Drive.\\" After several other singles, Nanao recorded his debut album throughout early to mid-1999, and released it in August, titled Ame ni Utaeba...! Disc 2. In March 2000, Nanao performed his first live at the Shinjuku Liquid Room. Nanao slowly worked on his second studio album, Heavenly Punk: Agadio, throughout 2000 and 2001, releasing two singles in 2000. Most of the work was completed between December 2001 and March 2002, with the final product released in April. The album was the first album to be released through Wonderground Music, an independent record label. In May and June 2002, Nanao performed his first tour alongside Hiroya Komeiji, performing at four cities across Japan. Nanao continued to work with Wonderground, releasing a self- accompanied album in 2003 and a single+DVD set in 2004. The single was the first of Nanao's works through both Sony and Wonderground to chart on Oricon's albums and single charts. In 2007, Nanao released a three CD musical album called 911 Fantasia, themed around the events of the September 11 attacks. Nanao considers this the peak work of his teens and 20s. The release of this album lead to Nanao's introduction to rapper Yakenohara, and the pair collaborated with the single \\"Rollin' Rollin\\" in 2009. This, along with Nanao, 2010 album, were both releases that charted in the top 50.  Discography  *Ame ni Utaeba...!

The architecture is significant as the oldest surviving example of the \\"Palentine style\\", the romanesque idiom of the province of Palencia. It was founded in 1063 by the Countess Elvira S√°nchez, and originally constructed with a central nave and a square apse. In the mid- twelfth century, Rodrigo, youngest son of Count Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara and his wife Eva, became its prior, an unprecedented move for a male member of an aristocratic family in Castile.Simon Barton, The Aristocracy in Twelfth- century Le√≥n and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 192.

Bartley resigned on 11 July 1854 to take up a place in the Legislative Council. The election was won by William Brown over John Williamson. Nomination meeting The nomination meeting was held on 1 August, at a time soon after midday. Thomas Beckham, the returning officer and a future MP of the electorate, kicked off the meeting by reading out the writ. Alexander Black was the first elector to nominate someone, that person being John Williamson. Coolahan seconded that nomination, his reasons being that Williamson had acted well in the Provincial Council. Joseph Newman then counterproposed William Brown, an action seconded by James George. With no other electors advancing a nomination, Beckham declared a show of hands to be called. After the show of hands Beckham stated that it was in favour of Brown.

The norm for Mathis projects from this era was to cover recent hits, and the title track of this one was so recent that the version by Andy Williams began a 13-week run to number nine on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart in February 1971, coinciding with the release of this LP.. The Mathis recording of \\"Ten Times Forever More\\" was released as a single on January 21 of that year(2015) The Singles by Johnny Mathis [CD booklet].

Love Story was released for the first time on compact disc in 1995 as one of two albums on one CD, the other LP being his Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head album from 1970. Reception Allmusic's Joe Viglione found much to praise retrospectively about the album and Mathis. \\"His rendition of '(Where Do I Begin) Love Story' is riveting, a sweeping and majestic piece to lead off the record, and not the usual Jack Gold musical movement, but more pronounced and determined.\\" Viglione was especially fond of how Lynn Anderson's country hit \\"Rose Garden\\" was given a mainstream arrangement. \\"As a pure pop tune, it works very well, a standout performance chock-full of backing vocalists and unique instrumentation. This could have been a hit for Mathis, as it goes beyond the usual formula of 'let's put some sweet accompaniment behind the voice and let Johnny do his thing.'\\" He describes side two as \\"careful and pleasant\\", except for its closing song, \\"Loss of Love\\", which \\"brings a sense of grandness back to the project and concludes an important component of the vast Johnny Mathis catalog.\\" Track listing =Side one= #\\"(Where Do I Begin) Love Story\\" (Francis Lai, Carl Sigman) ‚Äì 2:45 #\\"Rose Garden\\" (Joe South) ‚Äì 2:51 #\\"Ten Times Forever More\\" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) ‚Äì 2:36 #\\"It's Impossible\\" (Armando Manzanero, Sid Wayne) ‚Äì 3:00 #\\"I Was There\\" (Gerry Goffin, Carole King) ‚Äì 2:26 #\\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\" from The Happy Ending (Alan Bergman, Marilyn Bergman, Michel Legrand) ‚Äì 3:00 =Side two= #\\"We've Only Just Begun\\" (Roger Nichols, Paul Williams) ‚Äì 3:05 #\\"Traces\\" (Buddy Buie, J.

It first aired on Fox in the United States on February 13, 2011. This episode mainly centers on Roger and Stan, who begin to experience tensions growing against each other for the dominant figure in the house. Roger becomes tired of Stan's stance as the authoritarian figure of the house, and he challenges Stan's leadership qualities. Stan insists that he is better at Roger at everything, and he tells him that he has a mission that involves acting. Unknown to Stan, Roger spies on him, only to find out that Stan is a terrible actor. Roger later boasts to the house that he is a better actor than Stan, but he eventually teaches him to improve his acting skills. Meanwhile, Steve and his friends plan to throw their last slumber party together. This episode was written by Chris and Matt McKenna and directed by Bob Bowen, with Jacob Hair as the assistant director. It received highly positive reviews from television critics and fans alike upon its initial airing. The episode was viewed by over 3.94 million viewers upon its initial airing, and it garnered a 1.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings. It featured guest appearances from Lucy Lawless and Terry Crews, as well as several recurring voice actors and actresses for the show. Plot Roger auditions for a new play entitled \\"Pi√±ata Man\\" and begins boasting about his acting ability, infuriating Stan. Stan insists that he's a better actor and is still the \\"top dog\\" in the house. Francine gets frustrated with their constant fighting while Hayley attributes it to sexual tension and says they should just have sex already and get over it. Roger, disbelieving the story, follows Stan to work and sees that he is indeed acting as a waiter in a CIA sting. However Stan is a terrible actor, unable to even offer water to the patrons convincingly and causing the sting to turn sour, resulting in the deaths of several agents. Back home Roger taunts Stan over his failure and Stan finally admits that he can't act, with Roger recommending an acting coach (who, as Stan correctly predicts, is another of Roger's personas.) Stan shows progress by acting out a scene from WarGames, but refuses to perform the love scene with Roger as the \\"leading lady\\". At the casting call for \\"Pi√±ata Man\\", the title role goes to Stan, who reveals that he took the acting lessons so he could steal the role right out from under Roger and reassert his dominance. On Opening Night, Roger injures the leading lady and her understudy so he can claim the role and show up Stan. The performance devolves into the pair desperately trying to outdo one another, including damaging the set and turning a scene into an impromptu battle rap. When they come to the love scene, Roger is confident that Stan won't be able to kiss him, but Stan gets over his disgust and does so; this leads to another battle of one-upmanship as they perform increasingly raunchier sexual acts until finally they're both arrested for public indecency for simulating sexual intercourse on stage. In the police car, Stan and Roger have become friends again, complimenting each other's acting talent to the confusion of Francine and Hayley reaffirming what she said at the start of the episode. Meanwhile, Steve and his friends plan to have a slumber party together. Vince Chung and the rest of the school students overhear and make fun of them, and Steve's friends think that they are too old to have a slumber party. Steve later suggests that this be the last sleepover that he and his friends will ever have. At a local pizzeria, Steve and his friends get into an argument over details, including a moment where Toshi tells Snot to \\"eat his balls\\" after he screams at him to learn English. In the end, they hold a sleepover at Steve's treehouse, being reunited with the alleged fifth member of the group who had moved away years ago, and this time all trying to achieve autofellatio with that fifth member succeeding as the other boys watch in awe. Production Lucy Lawless made a guest appearance on the episode \\"A Pi√±ata Named Desire\\" was written by series regulars Chris and Matt McKenna, in their second episode of the season. This would be the first episode that both writers would write since the season six episode \\"Fart-break Hotel\\". This episode was directed by series regular Bob Bowen, with Jacob Hair as the assistant director. This would be the third time Bowen has directed an episode for the season, having also directed season six episode \\"For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls\\" and \\"White Rice\\". Seth MacFarlane, the creator and executive producer of American Dad!, as well as its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, served as the executive producer for the episode, along with series veterans Mike Barker, Rick Wiener, Matt Weitzman, and Kenny Schwartz. Diana Retchey was the animation producer for the episode, in her seventh episode of the season. She has also been the animation producers for many Cartoon Network shows, such as Johnny Bravo and Samurai Jack. Amanda Bell served as the production manager, while Michael Wittenberg would serve as the post-production supervisor for the episode. This would be Bell's eighth episode of the season where she served as the production manager, while this would be Wittenberg's ninth episode of the season as the post-production supervisor. This episode featured a guest appearance from Lucy Lawless, who provided the voice for Stacy. Recurring voice actors Curtis Armstrong, Daisuke Suzuki and Eddie Kaye Thomas guest starred as Steve's friends in the episode. Armstrong previously reprised his role in \\"Stan's Food Restaurant\\", while Suzuki and Thomas reprised their roles in \\"Best Little Horror House in Langley Falls\\". Reception \\"A Pi√±ata Named Desire\\" was broadcast on February 13, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox. The show started off the line up, the third consecutive week that American Dad started off Fox's \\"Animation Domination\\" block. It was followed by The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. It was viewed by 3.94 million viewers upon its original airing, despite airing simultaneously with Dateline NBC, 60 Minutes on CBS, and America's Funniest Home Videos on ABC. It achieved a 1.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, the lowest rating of the line up. The episode's total viewership and ratings were significantly down from the previous episode, \\"Stanny Boy and Frantastic\\", which was viewed by 4.80 million viewers upon its initial airing, and garnered a 2.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic. \\"A Pi√±ata Named Desire\\" was met with highly positive reception by television critics and fans alike upon its initial release. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a very positive review, saying the show \\"is back in fine form tonight, something notable from the start when they bypass a full credit sequence in favor of a simple title card.\\" Kaiser highly praised the main plot, calling the interaction between Stan and Roger \\"fantastic throughout.\\" However, he wrote a mixed review about the secondary plot of the episode, suggesting that Steve's idea to plan a \\"sleepover to end all sleepovers\\" with his friends is \\"a pretty typical sitcom plot for adolescents\\". Furthermore, \\"American Dad adds nothing new except more self- blowjob-attempt jokes. It's not terrible, and if nothing else, it highlights just how good the Roger/Stan [...] storyline is. Despite his criticisms, he rated the episode an A-, the highest grade of the night, scoring higher than The Simpsons episode \\"The Blue and the Gray\\", the Bob's Burgers episode \\"Sexy Dance Fighting\\", the Family Guy episode \\"Friends of Peter G., and The Cleveland Show episode \\"A Short Story and a Tall Tale\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling it \\"funny\\". He praised the main plot, find it hilarious when \\"seeing Stan completely screw up a mission because he's not as good at acting as Roger is.\\" As for Roger's acting in the episode, he says \\"it should have been obvious that he's a natural,\\" especially when \\"he even has boobs when he plays women.\\" References External links Category:2011 American television episodes Category:American Dad!

Overview The museum resulted from the purchase by the city of the Buenos Aires home of Enrique Larreta, perhaps the most prominent Argentine exponent of Hispanic modernism in literature, and Ambassador to France from 1910 to 1919. Larreta made numerous visits to √Åvila, Spain, during his tenure, and he amassed a large collection of medieval art, armor, tapestries, Spanish Renaissance art, Spanish baroque art and decor, manuscripts, wood carvings, and French furniture, among other collections.Acceder: Documentos privados y manuscritos: Museo Enrique Larreta Larreta died in 1961, and his family sold his home and its collections to the City of Buenos Aires for its conversion into the Museum of Spanish Art. The museum was inaugurated in 1962, and named in his honor. Its collections were enriched further by the 1977 transfer of portions of the Isaac Fern√°ndez Blanco Museum of Hispanic Art.Museo Larreta: Historia The former Larreta home, designed by Argentine architect Ernesto Bunge, and inaugurated in 1886, is a work of neo-Spanish colonial architecture, and features an Andalusian patio measuring 6,500 m¬≤ (70,000 ft¬≤) and connected to the house via an extensive portico.

Historical, as well as religious, designs were used, and the ornamented portal, for instance, was a copy of the entry to the Casa Basavilbaso (a former customs house which had earlier been demolished).

It begins when a group uses technology to walk through a bank's wall and steal a safe deposit box. Its contents contain special equipment meant to ultimately break David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) out of his Frankfurt jail. The episode was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman and executive producer Jason Cahill, and was directed by Michael Zinberg. \\"Safe\\" featured guest starring performances from Harris, Chance Kelly (as Mitchell Loeb), James Frain (as Salman Kohl), and Michael Cerveris (as the Observer). The episode first aired in the United States on December 2, 2008 on the Fox network. An estimated 8.54 million viewers watched \\"Safe\\", making it Fox's fourth most watched show of the week. It premiered to mostly positive reviews, with some believing it improved the entire season by providing more meaning to previous episode mysteries. IGN ranked it as the seventh best episode of the entire series in 2013. Plot At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a group of men led by Agent Mitchell Loeb break in and use a machine that makes it possible to walk through the bank's wall. Several men pass through the wall and steal a safe deposit box numbered 610. One of the men is unable to make it back through, however, before the wall solidifies again, and he is left stuck inside the wall; Loeb shoots him in the head to prevent him from talking, and they leave. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrive to investigate, and Broyles says this is the third robbery where a large safe deposit box has been taken. Olivia says she recognizes the victim as Raul Lugo from their time in the Marines together. Peter and Walter go to a local hardware store and buy an electric saw to cut the man out of the wall. Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned biochemist David Robert Jones is visited by his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones that the job in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, and he makes a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She says the only people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end when they find out that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind. The boxes are found to have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is examined and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul from one of his old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to remember what he put in the boxes and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men. Kohl arrives with Jones' requested items and is told to come the following morning with some paperwork. Jones also asks Kohl for one more thing: Olivia. Peter insists on interrogating the wounded man himself and tells him he has radiation poisoning. The man breaks down and says he was hired freelance but does not know his boss's name. He says all he knows is that his crew is going to a field in Westford, and Olivia figures out it is Little Hill, a word previously given to Jones. Walter remembers the machine he built that is hidden in the safe deposit boxes is able to \\"retrieve anyone from anywhere\\". Loeb and his remaining team begin setting up at Little Hill, while Jones kills Kohl in Frankfurt. Jones puts on Kohl's suit and is seen preparing for something by putting on suntan lotion and eye drops. While the FBI converge on Little Hill, Olivia is attacked and captured en route by Loeb's forces. Jones is successfully teleported from Frankfurt to Little Hill. Production \\"Safe\\" was written by co-executive producer David H. Goodman and consulting producer Jason Cahill, while Michael Zinberg served as the episode's director. It was Goodman's third contribution to the series and Cahill's second. It was the only Fringe episode by Zinberg, a prolific television director who has directed over eighty other television series. Along with \\"The Equation\\", \\"Safe\\" resolved much of the storyline surrounding Mitchell Loeb (played by guest actor Chance Kelly), as it addressed how Loeb's team desired to use the equation. The episode featured guest stars James Frain as Salman Kohl, Jared Harris as David Robert Jones, and Michael Cerveris as the Observer. During the first half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on balancing serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, \\"Safe\\" marked a turning point in the series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life. Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, \\"We found who we were in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying we got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case ‚Äì a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work ‚Äî but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes. What keeps the show most watchable is the fact that it is character-based.\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"Safe\\" first broadcast in the United States on December 2, 2008. It was watched by an estimated 8.54 million viewers, making it the Fox network's fourth most watched show of the week. The episode garnered a 5.3/8 household ratings share and a 3.6/9 among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. It was the last Fringe episode of 2008 and it began the mid-season break, as the next episode, \\"Bound\\", aired in January. =Reviews= Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode 9.5/10, writing \\"This wasn't just a good episode ‚Äì it was great. It capitalized on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably going to want to tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before ‚Äì as now all the pieces are important\\". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that \\"Safe\\" could have been used as the series' pilot. \\"The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It‚Äôs a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place\\". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode \\"was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up\\". The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen graded the episode with an A-, praising the opening as \\"quite good\\" and believing the tie between Walter and his past research \\"changes the game\\" (\\"Having Walter be, in a way, the source of the current disturbance suddenly made everything that much more important\\"). Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic to get out of her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, \\"Now this is science fiction! I was absolutely thrilled by this week's episode\\". She elaborated by praising Olivia's \\"B story\\" about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of \\"cold-blooded\\" villains, and believed \\"the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance.\\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted \\"Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and it really does feel like the end of a chapter. What started as the 'wacky science project of the week' builds to an episode that feels like a mini season finale.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode an A, while website blogger io9 highlighted \\"Safe\\" as one of the \\"crucial\\" episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"Safe\\" the eighth best episode of the series, explaining that it \\"centered on a character that might be Fringes most memorable villain, the charismatic mastermind David Robert Jones, played by Mad Men's Jared Harris. His second appearance ‚Äî built around a clever jail break involving teleportation ‚Äî made for a riveting and much-needed outing, as it landed right at a time when many critics and viewers were beginning to doubt.\\" IGN found the episode to be the seventh best of the series, noting it as a turning point for the show.

Larry Blamire directed and acted in the film and wrote the screenplay. The film also includes many cast members from Blamire's previous films (such as The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Trail of the Screaming Forehead) The title refers to the often-parodied opening sentence from the novel Paul Clifford by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Plot On a dark and stormy night in the 1930s, a number of people gather at an isolated country estate to hear the reading of the will of the wealthy Sinas Cavinder, including: wealthy nephew Burling Famish Jr. (Brian Howe) and his wife Pristy (Christine Romeo); Pristy's dim-witted lover Teak Armbruster (Kevin Quinn); big-game hunter Jack Tugdon (Jim Beaver); the foppish Lord Partfine (Andrew Parks); elderly Mrs. Hausenstout (Betty Garrett); kindly Seyton Ethelquake (James Karen); and the fragile Sabasha Fanmoore (Fay Masterson), Cavinder's ward. They are joined by rival reporters Eight O'Clock Faraday (Daniel Roebuck) and Billy Tuesday (Jennifer Blaire) along with cab driver Happy Codburn (Dan Conroy), to whom Faraday owes \\"toity- five cents\\" (not including tip). The party grows by two when psychic Mrs. Cupcupboard (Allison Martin) and \\"stranded motorist\\" Ray Vestinhaus (Larry Blamire) arrive unexpectedly. The large group gathers in the home's parlor so that lawyer Farper Twyly (Mark Redfield) can read the will. Before Twyly begins, the guests note the unusual threats surrounding the estate: Sabasha has been the subject of mysterious death threats; a serial killer known as the \\"Cavinder Strangler\\" is still at large and in the area; and it happens to be the same night on which the 300-year-old ghost of Sarah Cavinder is supposed to return. Twyly reads the will, revealing that some characters receive trivial gifts and other substantial ones. The bulk of the estate is given to Sabasha, but with the clause that upon her death the estate would then be given to Burling. Twyly then reveals the existence of an additional letter that amends the will; he discovers that it has been stolen, but assures the group that he and only he knows the contents. Before he can recite the letter, the lights are turned off. When they are turned back on, the group discovers that Twyly has been stabbed to death. When Ray tells the group that the only bridge back to town collapsed behind him, Faraday and Tuesday suggest that they all wait until morning for the police to arrive. However, at the stroke of midnight, Pristy is strangled by a masked killer. Dr. Van Von Vandervon (H.M. Wynant) arrives and announces that he's tracked an escaped lunatic to the house, but because of the nature of his work (in which the therapist and patient never see each other), he is not sure what the patient looks like, or even if it's a man or woman. Over the course of the evening, the group attempts to find both the letter and clues leading to the killer. A seance is held by Mrs. Cupcupboard, but the spirit (Marvin Kaplan) is of no help. Mrs. Hausenstout occasionally pops up with a gorilla (Bob Burns) in tow, and a police inspector (Tom Reese) arrives‚Äîand is promptly killed. As the night progresses, Jack, Teak, Seyton and Dr. Von Vandervon are murdered, as is Archie the cook (Robert Deveau). Happy discovers a woman (Susan McConnell) locked in an attic room. Although the group assumes she is the ghost of Sarah Cavinder, the housemaid Jane (Trish Geiger) tells them that she is Thessaly, the confrontational and slightly insane daughter of Sinas Cavinder. Jane also knows the contents of the letter and tells Faraday and Tuesday that the letter makes Thessaly, not Sabasha, the inheritor of the estate. Faraday and Tuesday track down and confront the guilty parties‚ÄîBurling and Sabasha, who began the night working independently but who later \\"joined forces\\" to knock off their rivals to the inheritance. Faraday and Tuesday also deduce that the real Sabasha is dead and that the woman pretending to be her is actually Dr. Von Vandervon's escaped lunatic. Burling threatens to blow up the house unless Faraday and Tuesday turn over the letter, but he is accidentally electrocuted after being confronted by Thessaly. Ray appears and admits that he is actually Bax Tremblay, a police investigator working undercover. He, Faraday, and Tuesday attempt to apprehend the false Sabasha, but she strangles herself to death to avoid capture. The next morning, Thessaly takes possession of the estate. Faraday proposes marriage to Tuesday and she accepts; the two of them agree to share their newspaper \\"scoop.\\" They are driven away by Happy, who belatedly realizes that because he left the cab's meter running all night, Faraday owes him $87.42.

It is a successor traditional authority of the former Kingdom of which was established in the Khora‚ÄìAngar area of the present Republic of Djibouti at the end of the 9th century. Location The present-day territory of the Afar Sultanate of Dawe extends from the Highland Plateau (Baate Mountain) Waytaale on the west to the Eastern base of the Ethiopian highlands. To the south it borders to the Somali Region and the Republic of Djibouti. To the east it borders to the Administrative Zone 3 of the Afar Region and to the north it shares borders with the Administrative Zone 1 of the Afar Regional State. The traditional Territory of the Afar Sultanate of Dawe is currently divided into six administrative districts. They are: #District of Dawe #District of Cadda le Qeela #District of Koomaami #District of Talalak #District of Xaale Faage #District of Qad Daqar (Ad-Daar District- is now located in Zone 1) Political System The Afar Sultanate of Dawe is the hereditary traditional political Authority of the Afar people of the Eastern Region of the Afar Regional State in Ethiopia. Its political system is based on an egalitarian, social democratic political system and a communal democracy principle. Its legitimacy is derived from an acknowledgment of respect, loyalty, sovereignty and wishes of the Afar people. The power and authority of the Afar Sultanate of Dawe is based on the people and on the Sultan. The Amoyta of Afar Sultanate of Dawe has had absolute power over his subject. His decision was final and no appeal. In the Sultanate of Dawe, each clan has a hierarchical order of clan chieftainship with the senior most linear chief or a head of clan as leader of the tribe among particular clan. This indicates that tribes and clan systems among the people of the Sultanate of Dawe have a broad-based confederacy system that similar to that of the Confederations Helvetica of Switzerland. The citizens and people of the Sultanate of Dawe have enjoyed equal rights and freedom since its re-establishment at the end of the 16th century during Misli Hamad the Great's reign. The Afar people of the Eastern Afar Sultanate of Dawe have always practiced a form of pastoral democratic socialism based on a collective sharing and social solidarity principle. This form of social solidarity is unique. It is called, Titt√¢ luk Aalliyy√°, which means having it together, sharing together or collective ownership.

Their Customary laws based on Convention, Precedent and Case Laws as an ancient Britain, Jewish, Malaysian and African societies. The laws are usually made by the Council of Elders with the presence of the Amoyta (Sultan) in the Council. It is administered by His Majesty‚Äôs Advisory Council of Elders at Haxa (at the Royal Court of Justice). Hara (Caxa) is the Royal Court of Justice of the Sultanate of Dawe that similar to the House of Lord of the Great Britain). In the Sultanate of Dawe, Traditional Courts are still the Higher Courts of Appeal and Centre of daily political life and places where important decisions are made in the Eastern Afar Region of the Afar Regional State. The Afar Customary Law of the Sultanate of Dawe (Zone 5 of the Afar Regional State) is still the guiding principle of the communities, due to its flexibility and clarity of legal jurisdiction and justice delivery and conflict resolution and reconciliation management. It has been reported that, the First Mada‚Äôa or Law of the Sultanate of Dawe was adopted during the reign of \\"Bodoyta\\" with participation of the following clans: #Bodoyta-Meela #Qable #Caysa-Maale #Rakba #Dermeela This Law was passed in Cuuyle Faagil area in the District of Cayyu (Obock), part of today Djibouti, where the first Law Conference meeting took place. The Second Law Amendment occurred during the reign of 'Aydam, the son of Bodoyta. Aydam was the second son of Bodoyta. The Third Law Amendment occurred during the reign of Amoyta Macammad Camad (Qeysa Macammadih dabaana), at the beginning of 18th century. This meeting was called by Ali Dawwaani Mohamed, and it took place in Teqo area that is located in the District of QAD-DAQAR- Zone 1. Ali Dawwaani Mohamed was a Senior Chief of Hayis tribes of Bodoyta-Meela. Since the reign of Aydam, the Chief of Hayis tribes had been, and continues to be a chief of Justice of Bodoyta-Meela Customary Law. He is the Senior Leader of the Tribal Chiefs Council and of the Advisory Council of Elders. In the Sultanate of Dawe, Judicial function of (Bodoyta-Meela Madqa)Customary Law is customarily governed by the Chief of Hayis tribes. The Fourth Law Amendment occurred in the 20th century, during the reign of the Grand Sultan Mohamed Bodaya - (Amoyta Boddayyi Macammad). [3] The Customary Law of the Afar Sultanate of the Afar Regional State is a considerable part of the law of the Afar Regional State Legal Justice. Equally, the traditional Authority of the Sultanate of Dawe is also part of Customary Laws and Practice of the Afar Regional State, because it has been recognized it as an important legal source of the Afar Regional State legal system. In the Sultanate of Dawe, the law making authority is vested in the Council of Elders and tribes Chiefs Council with the presence of Afar clan leaders, religious institutions and Peer Group Organisations. The Peer group is representative of civil societies and their Organisations. In terms of law, their participation in lawmaking process is highly significant. In the absence of the Sultan the Council of Elders and the Council of tribal Chiefs are in charge to judge cases, to pass laws, to resolve disputes and to maintain law and order in accordance with the Conventions and Precedents of the Sultanate of Dawe. The Councils of Elders and Chiefs are accountable and answerable to His Majesty the Sultan of Dawe for their actions and decisions. The law forcing power is collectively administered by the Council of Elders and the Council of Chiefs. All decisions taken whether in his presence or absence were announced as the Amoyta‚Äôs decision. The Prerogative power is solely vested on the Amoyta (Sultan).  Economic and Social Conditions of the Eastern Afar Region About 98% of the population leads a pastoral life by rearing camels, cattle, goats, sheep and donkeys. Agriculture is very limited. Pastoralism is the leading occupation of the people. The Eastern Afar Region is a well-known zone for its livestock resources from which 98% of the Eastern Afar people earn their livelihood. The Region is estimated to have about 8 million domestic animals out of which sheep and goats constitute 60%. Cattle are the second and Camels the third most important domestic animals and the fourth is Donkeys. However, for many years the Afar people of the Eastern Afar Sultanate region systematically experienced political, economic and social injustice and discrimination as a people by successive Ethiopian Governments. The Eastern Afar People have been threatened disproportionately and deliberately by political, cultural and linguistic assimilation into the Central State of Ethiopia. The Eastern Afar Region ‚ÄúZone 5‚Äù is one of the least developed and marginalized territory of the whole Afar Regional State in Ethiopia, in terms of economic and social development and basic infrastructure and nation building. In general, the Afar Region is one of the least developed Regions of Ethiopia, neglected by national development efforts. [4] Development has usually taken the form of assimilation by the central Ethiopian State and partial annexation into Ethiopia‚Äôs highland economy.[5] Development Scheme in the Afar region, has historically reflected the priorities of central government or selects commercial and political interests, while the needs and aspiration of the Afar people have been chiefly disregarded\\".[6] References #Haji Ibad Ibrahim Gaas, (Interview, 2000) #Amoyti Omar (Omar Sultan Mohamed Bodaya) Interview 2000 #Arbahim Omar,Qas Baxah Arbaahim.

He was the executive producer of the syndicated game shows, Jeopardy!List of production credits for Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune,List of production credits for Wheel of Fortune from 1999 to 2020.Friedman's bio on the Wheel of Fortune website Initially he shared the title of executive producer with the shows' creator, Merv Griffin, but since Griffin's 2000 retirement till his own 2020 retirement, he served as their sole executive producer. Friedman has produced a combined total of more than 5,500 episodes of Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. Friedman introduced a number of new gameplay elements, theme weeks, and technological advances to both programs, and in 2006 he led both shows to make television history by becoming the first syndicated television series to broadcast in high definition. Early life and career Friedman was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an early fascination with television programming and personalities, including Johnny Carson when he was a young local celebrity. Long before the conception of student internships, Friedman began working for Omaha's first television stations, doing whatever work management permitted. In 1971, Friedman moved to Los Angeles, and without contacts he gave himself six months to find a job in the business. With less than 24 hours remaining on his self-imposed deadline, Friedman became a part-time question writer on the TV game show The Hollywood Squares, and continued with that show for eleven years, writing and producing thousands of episodes for three different versions of the show. He was also involved in the development of such other programs as Gambit and High Rollers. =Wheel of Fortune= Friedman became a producer of Wheel of Fortune in 1995. During his tenure with the show, Friedman has attempted to keep the show's gameplay fresh and exciting with many new additions to the rules. The new gameplay elements and rule modifications that were introduced to Wheel during Friedman's tenure, in chronological order based on their times of introduction, include the progressive cash jackpot wedge (in 1996), Toss-Up puzzles (in 2000), the increase of the bonus round's top value from its previous $25,000 to $100,000 (in 2001), the replacement of said round's former \\"W-H-E-E-L\\" prize envelope holder with the current \\"Bonus Wheel\\" (also in 2001), the Mystery wedges (in 2002), the Prize Puzzle (in 2003), the Wild Card (in 2006), the million dollar wedge (in 2008), the replacement of the long- standing Free Spin token with the Free Play wedge (in 2009), the ¬Ω Car tags (in 2011), and most recently, retiring the jackpot wedge in favor of the new Express wedge (in 2013). Friedman was responsible for many of Wheel's digital extensions, including the launch of the show's official website, and the development of video games based on the show for Sony's PlayStation consoles and Nintendo's Wii. He also conceived adaptations of the show for the iPhone, the iPad, and other electronic devices. A major technological advancement initiated by Friedman was the introduction of a new, highly sophisticated set in 2003. This set incorporates an LED and glass light extension, as well as a modernized puzzle board with LCD screens that can be touched by the hostess to make letters appear. The show's \\"Wheel Watchers Club\\", the first-ever, long- term, online viewer loyalty program in television history (now totaling over 5.7 million members), and its extension, the \\"SPIN I.D.\\" program, were both developed by Friedman. Additionally, he conceptualized the \\"Wheelmobile,\\" a mobile touring vehicle used by the show to conduct contestant search events across the United States. =Jeopardy!= A producer of Jeopardy! since 1997, Friedman has broadened the program's scope by expanding the list of categories, adding clues reflecting popular culture, and introducing a variety of special tournaments, including the 1997 International Tournament that was taped in Stockholm, Sweden; this was the only tournament to be taped outside the U.S. He oversaw the doubling of the prize money available in each round of play in November 2001; the dollar amounts or the Jeopardy! Round increased from $100-$500 to $200-$1,000, and Double Jeopardy!'s clue values increased from $200-$1,000 to $400-$2,000. For the show's 4000th episode in 2002, he also produced the Million Dollar Masters Tournament taped at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, which reunited 15 former Jeopardy! champions. For the show's 20th season in 2003, Friedman lifted not only Jeopardy!'s cap on the returning champions' total winnings, but also the long-standing five-day limit on the number of episodes on which they could appear. His implementation of this rule change allowed champions to continue making an indefinite number of appearances on the program and amassing winnings as long as they remained victorious, leading the way for Ken Jennings, at the time a software engineer from Salt Lake City, Utah, to win on 74 consecutive Jeopardy! programs (losing on his 75th) and amass a record total of $2,520,700, breaking almost every game show record in the history of American television. The quiz show's viewership increased by 30 percent during the streak, and it often out- performed even prime-time programs to become one of the most talked-about shows in the United States. In 2005, in response to Jennings' tremendous success on the show, Friedman also produced the Ultimate Tournament of Champions, in which 145 former champions played for a top prize of $2,000,000; Jennings, seeded as the only automatic finalist, pocketed $500,000 when he came in second to Brad Rutter, who won the top prize, with Jerome Vered placing third and collecting $250,000. Friedman continues to add new Jeopardy! formats, such as the 2009-2010 Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, in which 27 players from past Celebrity Jeopardy! matches returned to compete, with Michael McKean winning one million dollars for his charity; and, in 2011, both the inaugural Teachers' Tournament and the IBM Challenge, in which IBM's computer system Watson defeated both Jennings and Rutter. In the late 1990s, Friedman participated with Scott Sternberg in the conception of two spin-offs of Jeopardy!: a music-intensive version called Rock & Roll Jeopardy! which aired on the VH1 network from 1998 to 2001, and a kids' version called Jep! which aired on the Game Show Network (now known by its abbreviated name, \\"GSN\\") for one season from 1998 to 1999. Clue Crew In 2001, Friedman played an instrumental role in the formation of Jeopardy!'s \\"Clue Crew\\", a team of roving correspondents who travel the world showcasing clues accompanied by video for the show's home viewers. As of 2011, the team has traveled to 200 cities worldwide, through 45 of the 50 U.S. states, and to 33 foreign countries. Friedman's explanation of the reasoning behind the team's creation was as follows: The team currently comprises Sarah Whitcomb Foss and Jimmy McGuire. In the past, they included Kelly Miyahara, Sofia Lidskog, Cheryl Farrell, and Jon Cannon. Both Foss and McGuire also perform in-show duties when shows are filmed, with Foss the show's in-studio announcer for early sessions and McGuire the host of practice games. Internet Friedman plays a very active role in the show's official website, which receives over 400,000 visitors per month. =Other work= Friedman worked with Bob Stewart Productions as the executive consultant for the 2002‚Äì2004 version of Pyramid, and produced the 1993‚Äì1994 game show Caesars Challenge for Rick Rosner and Stephen J. Cannell's production companies. His other writing and producing credits include network primetime specials such as American Yearbook for CBS, documentaries such as Nova on PBS, and home video. He has also worked over the years with such other television production companies as FOX, Dick Clark Productions, Buena Vista Television, ABC, Orion Television, Laurel Entertainment, Vin Di Bona Productions, A&E; Network, Krofft Productions, and Four Star Productions. Friedman is a member of the Writers Guild of America, West and the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. =Retirement= On August 1, 2019, Sony Pictures Television announced that Friedman will retire as executive producer of both Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune following the 2019‚Äì20 season despite COVID-19 cutting his last season short. He will be succeeded by Mike Richards. Personal life Friedman lives in Los Angeles with his wife Judy (married since 1973), and they have two daughters, Amy (married to Dax Shelby) and Leslie (a personal trainer living in Denver), and one granddaughter, Ayla Marin Shelby. Awards and honors Since Friedman joined Jeopardy!, the show has come to receive the most awards and honors of any syndicated game show in television history. As of 2020, the program has won a total of 43 Daytime Emmy Awards in the following categories: Outstanding Show, Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show, Outstanding Special Class Writing, Outstanding Game Show Host, and Outstanding Directing For A Game/Audience Participation Show. Friedman has won fourteen Emmy Awards; the most Emmy awards won by a game show producer In January 2007, the National Association of Television Program Executives honored him with its prestigious \\"Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award\\", and, in October of that same year, Broadcasting & Cable inducted him into its Hall of Fame.

Alexander, 4th Lord Forbes of Pitsligo (Alexis-Simon Belle, 1720 Life He was the only son of Alexander Forbes, 3rd Lord Forbes of Pitsligo, by Lady Sophia Erskine, third daughter of John, ninth earl of Mar, and was born 22 May 1678. He succeeded to the estates and title on the death of his father in 1691. In early manhood, he travelled in France, made the acquaintance of F√©nelon, and was introduced by him to Madame Guyon and other quietists. Their influence led him to devote attention to the mystical writers. He was an adherent of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Scotland, and a supporter of the exiled Stuart family. He was strongly opposed to the Act of Union, and on the oath of abjuration being extended to Scotland, ceased to attend Parliament. Having taken part in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 he was compelled, after the retreat of Mar, to take refuge on the continent. In 1720 he returned to Scotland, taking up residence mainly at Pitsligo, where he continued a correspondence with the quietists, and engaged in a kind of transcendental devotion. On the outbreak of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, though sixty-seven years of age and asthmatic, he took up arms on behalf of the Stuarts. He raised a regiment of cavalry, numbering about a hundred, and composed chiefly of Aberdeenshire gentlemen and their tenants. He arrived at Edinburgh on 8 October 1745, a few days after the Jacobite victory at the battle of Prestonpans. After the defeat at the battle of Culloden he remained in hiding near Pitsligo. His main place of concealment was a cave among the cliffs approximately 2.5 miles from Rosehearty, and disguised himself as a beggar. His estates were seized in 1748, but in the act of attainder he was named Lord Pitsligo, a misnomer for Lord Forbes of Pitsligo. On this account he tried to obtain a reversal of the attainder, but though the court of session gave judgment in his favour 10 November 1749, this decision was reversed on appeal to the House of Lords 1 February 1750. After this the search for him relaxed, and he stayed for the most part with his son at Auchiries, under the name of Mr. Brown. The Countess of Erroll conveyed messages to him using the services of Jamie Fleeman, the Laird of Udny's fool. In March 1756 a party was sent to search for him, but he hid behind a wainscot, concealed by a bed in which a lady slept. He died on 21 December 1762. Works In 1734 he published ‚ÄòEssays Moral and Philosophical.‚Äô He wrote ‚ÄòThoughts concerning Man's Condition‚Äô in 1732, and it was published in 1763, and again in 1835, with memoir by his kinsman Lord Medwyn. Family He was twice married: first, to Rebecca, daughter of John Norton, merchant, London, by whom he had one son, John, master of Pitsligo; and secondly, to Elizabeth Allen, who had been companion to his first wife, but by this marriage there was no issue.

He was appointed by Pope Paul VI on 11 July 1964, resigned the see on 4 July 1985, and died on 5 June 1988. He was the leading New Zealand Catholic bishop in attempting to implement the decrees of the Vatican Council II and he was the leading bishop on social justice issues. Early life Ashby was born in Belfast, New Zealand, a suburb of Christchurch in 1923. He received his primary education at St Joseph's Convent, Papanui, and his secondary education at St Bede's College (to which he won a scholarship). In 1941, Ashby studied law at the University of Canterbury while working in a law office. Over the next two years, he served with the Fifth Canterbury Regiment. When the under-20s were released for further study in 1943, he began his study for the priesthood at Holy Cross College, Mosgiel. In 1946 he was selected by Bishop Lyons for theology studies in Rome where he was ordained on 1 January 1950. In 1951 he completed his doctorate in Theology.\\"The Church loses a gifted leader\\", Zealandia, 19 July 1988, pp. 1‚Äì3 Priesthood Ashby returned to Christchurch and was appointed as assistant priest in the new parish of North Timaru. In 1957 he became secretary to Bishop Joyce, the 4th Bishop of Christchurch. In 1960 Ashby was sent to London to study the techniques of the Catholic Enquiry Centre there. Ashby became the co-director of the New Zealand Catholic Enquiry Centre when it opened in Wellington in 1961. On 11 July 1964, Ashby was appointed as the Fifth Bishop of Christchurch, succeeding Bishop Joyce. Episcopacy Ashby was consecrated Bishop at the age of 41 (one of the youngest bishops to take office) on 5 August 1964 in the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch by Archbishop McKeefry of Wellington and the co-consecrators Archbishop Liston of Auckland and Bishop Snedden (Auxiliary Bishop of Wellington). Ashby attended the last sessions of the Second Vatican Council, an experience which placed him in an optimum position to help steer the New Zealand church through the difficult transition times following the Council. He tried to renew diocesan structures and he placed great emphasis on making himself accessible to his people. Ashby became the leading Catholic figure in the area of ecumenism. His work in this area was recognised in 1983 when Pope John Paul II appointed him to the Vatican Secretariat for the Promotion of Christian Unity. In 1983, Ashby was also the first New Zealand bishop to be appointed a member of the second Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, and was also chairman of the New Zealand Catholic Ecumenical Commission. He was the first Catholic bishop to preach in an Anglican cathedral in New Zealand and maintained an enduring personal friendship with the Anglican Bishop of Christchurch Bishop Pyatt. Ashby was the first New Zealand bishop to implement church sanctuary alterations in the wake of the second Vatican Council. The alterations introduced into the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacramant were controversial but Ashby insisted that they followed the Council decrees.Terry Olsen, \\"May fresh air blow on ‚Äì Bishop Ashby\\", Zealandia, 14 July 1985, p. 3. Social justice concerns Ashby had the role of visionary in the Catholic hierarchy and he became a significant leader in Church and community affairs. His youth, energy and charisma enabled him to take the lead on social justice issues, particularly those involving MƒÅori- Pakeha relations, overseas aid and sporting contacts with South Africa (which he visited, to see for himself the consequences of Apartheid)Michael King, God's Farthest Outpost: A History of Catholics in New Zealand, Penguin Books, Auckland, 1997, p. 181. Both he and his friend, Bishop Pyatt were outspoken critics of the 1981 Springbok Rugby Tour.\\"Catholic Bishop had strong social conscience\\", The Press, 6 June 1988, p. 3 The effect of Ashby's leadership was visible in 1981, when scarcely a priest in his diocese supported the tour. Ashby also headed the New Zealand Catholic Commission for Evangelisation, Justice and Development which gave money to HART (Halt All Racist Tours) in 1981 and later to the Waitangi Action Committee. Both donations brought criticism and debate within the Church. Ashby's services to the community were recognised when he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 Queen's Birthday Honours. Ashby said that he was a peaceful man but that he \\"owed it to my integrity to take the stands that I have taken\\". Retirement and death Ashby resigned the see on 4 July 1985 because of a stroke, after serving 21 years as Bishop of Christchurch. During his retirement he was president of the New Zealand Counter-Stroke Support Group. In April 1988, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and died on 5 June 1988 in the Mary Potter Hospital, Christchurch. His Requiem Mass was concelebrated before a congregation of 2,000 by bishops from all the New Zealand dioceses (the celebrants included Bishop John Gerry (Auxiliary Bishop of Brisbane).\\"Thousands pay respects\\", Zealandia, 19 June 1988, p. 1 Ashby is interred in Christchurch's Bromley Cemetery.

Opened in 1861, it forms part of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway, and is also a terminus of a secondary railway linking Rimini with Ravenna and Modena. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Rimini railway station is situated at Piazzale Cesare Battisti, at the northeastern edge of the city centre. History The station was constructed by the Societ√† Generalle delle Strade Ferrate Romane (), in 1860‚Äì1861. It was opened, in the presence of the then Prince Umberto of Savoy (later Umberto I of Italy), on 4 October 1861, together with the rest of the Forl√¨‚ÄìRimini section of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway. Very soon afterwards, on 17 November 1861, Rimini was transformed from a temporary terminal station into a through station, when the final section of that railway, from Rimini to Ancona, came into operation. The original station building was rather simple in form. It was located not far from the seaside, on the edge of the city, and was flanked by a locomotive depot and repair workshop. On 1 July 1865, the whole of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway, including the station, came under the control of the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (SFM) (). On 10 January 1889, the station became a junction for the newly completed branch line to Ravenna and Ferrara. This development, coupled with exponential growth in passenger traffic, created the need for an expansion of the station and its facilities, and the construction of other outbuildings. Soon enough, a further increase in traffic made it essential to move the passenger building to the south of the locomotive depot and workshop, where there was enough space for a new station yard with wider platforms. The new station building, designed by the architect Ulisse Dini, was opened on 1 November 1914. Between 1915 and 1917, following the entry of Italy into World War I, the station was bombarded by the Austro- Hungarian Navy. In 1932, it became a terminus of the short narrow gauge international line to San Marino, which ended at the apron of the station, adjacent to platform 1. In late 1938, in conjunction with electrification of the line to Ancona, important works were carried out to upgrade the station's facilities. However, between 1943 and 1944, after the outbreak of World War II, the station and its surrounds were repeatedly hit by allied bombing, in nearly 400 air raids. In the wake of World War II, damaged buildings were repaired. In 1963, new train control equipment was installed. In 1978, the station yard was further expanded, to 10 tracks equipped with platforms. Since the start of the 21st century, some tracks and the locomotive shed have been closed, and the goods yard converted into a car park. Features The renovated booking hall. The first station building was built in the classical style of the time. Its central section was on two levels, and it had two lateral wings, with adjacent service buildings. At that time, there were more than four platforms. The current passenger building, completed in 1914, was built with pretensions to elegance and functionality, and is now located amongst the historic buildings in the city. At the time of its completion, the number of tracks used for passenger services grew to seven. In the 1970s, three more platform tracks were added. Centostazioni has recently been renovating the passenger building with a simultaneous internal reorganization and change of use to the character of a shopping centre. Train services View of the platforms. The station has more than 5 million passenger movements each year. Many of the passengers are commuters arriving from and departing for Bologna Centrale, Ravenna and Ancona. The station is also heavily used by tourists holidaying on the Adriatic coast. The passenger trains calling at the station include regional trains and a pair of Eurostar trains operating between Rimini and Roma Termini.

They are typically 2‚Äì8 cm long and 5-18mm wide, margins are flat or distinctly recurved, with an obtuse to subacute apex. They are alternately arranged along the stem, and, as the name suggests, are most distinct in the contrasting colours of the leaf surfaces. The adaxial surface being a glossy dark green colour, and the abaxial surface being light green to silver-grey in colour. The abaxial surface is heavily coated in fine white hairs, and occasionally the adaxial surface will also have a sparse coating of white hairs. Abaxial leaf surface of P. bicolor Flowering occurs in spring. The attractive flowers typically occur at the nodes, and may be solitary, terminal or occur in small groups. The flowers are bell shaped, and the perianth consists of 5 sepals, which are 5-6mm long and slightly curve inwards at the apex, the lower surface is coated in fine white hairs. The 5 petals are 8-11mm long and are significantly recurved. The outside colour may vary from dark burgundy red to yellow, and is typically lighter on the inside. Each flower typically houses 5 stamens and a single pistil, the ovary is superior and heavily coated in fine hairs. Each flower occurs on a long pedicel which is coated in fine hairs. The fruit is a globose woody capsule, it is covered in fine white hairs, and varies in colour from orange to brown as it matures. The mature capsule splits in half to expose rows of 8-20 red or orange sticky seeds. Conspicuous dark valves can be seen on the inner face of the mature, open, capsule. The bark is grey to light brown in colour, and varies from a smooth and somewhat scaly in appearance lower down, to a rougher and papery appearance higher up. This plant grows in a conical shape, and typically achieves 2‚Äì10 metres in height, but may occasionally exceed this.  Distribution and habitat  thumb195x195pxFigure 1: Distribution of P. bicolor across Australia. Pittosporum bicolor occurs statewide across Tasmania and the Bass Strait Islands. It is loosely restricted to the south easternmost parts of New South Wales and Victoria (Figure 1). It grows as a shrub or a small tree in gullies and the shrub understorey of wet sclerophyll forests, and is therefore tolerant of shaded conditions. It prefers to grow in moist, well drained soils, and does not typically occur at altitudes greater than 1,000 metres above sea level. It is not uncommon for Pittosporum bicolor to occur as an epiphyte on soft tree fern species, such as Dicksonia antarctica,http://eprints.utas.edu.au/12416/2/Bowkett-Thesis.pdf this is possibly an adaptation to avoid seedlings being consumed by browsing mammals.  Related species  Pittosporum undulatum spp. emmetti is a hybrid species of P. bicolor and the introduced Pittosporum undulatum, the hybrid's physical appearance appears to be an intermediate between that of the two parent species.  Cultivation  P. bicolor is a relatively inconspicuous plant, and is therefore not widely cultivated. However, its attractive and heavily perfumed flowers offer some appeal to gardeners. It prefers a well draining soil, and will appreciate a sunny position, but will also thrive in a sheltered or shaded location. While it can survive in dry soils, it prefers moist or damp soils, likened to that of its natural habitat. It can tolerate heavy pruning. Propagation is done by seed or cuttings, the ripe seeds can be collected and directly planted, they will germinate freely. Cuttings should be taken from semi hardwood, and should include a heal at the base of the cutting. Propagation by seed is likely to be more successful than propagation by cuttings, however caution should be taken when planting seeds, due to members of this genus readily hybridising.

An executive home in Orkney Such houses were formerly described as mansionettes or bijou residences. The word mansion historically denotes homes with more character than an average executive home. This is because executive homes are usually constructed among homes of very similar size and type by a subdivider on speculation; they are generally built en-masse by development companies to be marketed as premium real estate. Executive homes can differ from traditional mansions mostly in their parcel size, since many of these newer homes are built on increasingly small lots so developers can maximize available acreage. Executive homes are generally found in outlying suburban areas because lot sizes in older neighborhoods generally are not conducive to new residences of this large scale. However there have been many instances of developers buying large lots or multiple lots in historic neighborhoods, demolishing the older homes and building executive homes. This may have the effect of destroying the setting of older neighborhoods, and adversely impacting the integrity of historic districts. These lots are in desirable neighborhoods, and desirable school districts, and are close to urban centers, so the trend will likely continue. However, some communities such as Wellesley, Massachusetts and Austin, Texas have created policies and ordinances to retain older neighborhoods against these development pressures.

Capable of simulating the aerial rockets then coming into operational service, the SCAR was used to train pilots in the use of the new type of weapon, and continued in service throughout the 1950s. Development With the introduction of the 3.5-Inch and 5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rockets, a need arose to train aircraft pilots in the proper tactics for the use of the new weapons. This requirement resulted in the development of a dedicated training rocket by the U.S. Navy.Parsch 2004 Designated 2.25-Inch Sub-Caliber Aircraft Rocket, the resulting rocket was a joint project between the Bureau of Ordnance and the National Defense Research Committee. As its name implied, the rocket was designed as a sub-calibre weapon compared to the FFAR, being only in diameter, but weighted to be ballistically similar to the larger operational weapons. Varying the amount of propellant in the SCAR's motor could produce accurate simulations of either type of FFAR's flight characteristics. Operational history SCAR in 1948 Following development, SCAR entered full-scale production in January 1945; by July, fully half of the U.S. Navy's rocket production for aircraft use consisted of SCAR rockets.Pearson 1995, p.33. SCAR was widely used during the latter part of World War II as a training round for the FFAR and, later, the High Velocity Aircraft Rocket. Following the end of the war, it remained in production, continuing in operational service throughout the 1950s.Aviation Ordnanceman 3&2, Volume 1. U.S. Navy Bureau of Naval Personnel 1955, p.194. Budget cutbacks prior to the outbreak of the Korean War meant that the SCAR was the only rocket used in training by the majority of pilots.Stewart 1957, p.108. Despite its small size, SCAR could be hazardous; in 1957, an injury aboard the aircraft carrier was caused by the unintended ignition of a SCAR rocket.Douda 2009, p.31.

The company became part of the ABB group as ABB Tecnomasio in 1988 after the merger of its parent. The plant in Vado Ligure became part of Adtranz and later part of Bombardier's transportation group. History The origins of Tecnomasio go back as far as 1863 when mechanical and civil engineer Luigi Longoni, instrument maker Carlo Dell'Acqua, and optical scientist Ignazio Porro founded a company in Milan. Porro left the company in 1864 to be replaced by photographer Alessandro Duroni forming the company Duroni, Longoni, Dell'Acqua. Alessandro gave up his stake in 1866 and Dell'Acqua in 1868 making Longoni the sole owner. In 1870 Bartolomeo Cabella joined the company. Longoni died in 1871, and Cabella became the director of the company. Initially the company produced scientific apparatus, including microscopes, heliostats, cathetometers, theodolites and arc lamps. Cabella took over the company in 1878 and the name became Ing. B. Cabella e C. Under Cabella's management the company attempted to expand its product range from precision instrument to one including industrial electromechanical devices such as alternators and dynamos; the company was converted to a limited company in 1898 as Societ√† Anonima Tecnomasio Italiano ing. B. Cabella e C. By 1903 the company was in a financial crisis, Cabella was dismissed from the company, and Brown Boveri of Switzerland took a 50% stake in the company, forming Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB). The company ended its production of instruments and became a manufacturer of industrial equipment. The milanese electromechanical company Gadda e C. was also acquired by Brown and Boveri in 1908 and the Westinghouse factory in Vado Ligure was acquired in 1921. During the next two decades the factories in Milan played a major role in supplying electrical generators and transformers for Italian hydroelectric plant. The company also became involved in railway electrification, electrifying the line from Bolzano to Brenner founding the company Sae.* During World War II the factories were badly damaged by bombing, afterwards production of locomotives and large-scale electrical generators began again, along with the start of production of white goods. In 1988 the company became part of the ABB Group after the merger of its parent Brown Boveri with ASEA, later it would become part of Adtranz, and after Adtranz became fully owned by DaimlerChrysler the name of Italian sub division became Daimler Chrysler Rail System (Italia) SpA. As of 2010 the Vado Ligure plant is part of Bombardier Transportation Italy S.p.A. and manufactures locomotives. Products and projects =Electricity generation and transmission= =Locomotives= In 1911 TIBB supplied the FS Class E.320 electric locomotives for the Italian Railways, whilst the Westinghouse plant in Vado Ligure manufactured the FS Class E.550 between 1908 and 1920. After the state railways decided on 3 kV DC electrification prototypes of class FS Class E.625 were produced in Vado Ligure. Post WWII the FS Class E.424 (1940s) and then FS Class E.636 (1950s) followed by the FS Class E.646 during the 1960s all of which were successful designs. During the 1960s and 1970s the FS Class E.444 and FS Class E.656 were produced, by the 1980s electronic chopper control began to be used, first in the FS Class E.632. By the 1990s the company had taken part in the consortium producing the ETR 500 high speed trains. From the 1990s, locomotive production switched to ABB-developed inverter-controlled AC induction motor technology, first introduced in the multivoltage electric locomotives of the FS Class E.412, already delivered as part of the Adtranz group. The FS Class E.464, a single- cabin electric locomotive manufactured at Vado Ligure from 1996 onwards would become one of the most numerous Italian locomotives ever with over 600 units ordered; production continued under Bombardier's ownership.

In early India education was rarely available to the common people. Foreign Jesuits initiated the school to remedy this problem. It began as a high school and later added higher secondary, under the accreditation of the Government of Tamil Nadu Education Board. It is government-aided but also receives funds from Jesuits abroad. It has an experienced academic and sports staff. Ignatius of Loyola St Ignatius of Loyola by Peter Paul Rubens, c. 1620‚Äì22 Ignatius of Loyola (, ) (1491‚Äì 31 July 1556) was a Spanish knight from a Basque noble family, priest since 1537, who founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and was its first Superior General. Ignatius emerged as a religious leader during the Counter-Reformation. Loyola's devotion to the Catholic Church was characterized by unquestioning obedience to the Catholic Church's authority and hierarchy. After being seriously wounded at the Battle of Pamplona in 1521, he underwent a spiritual conversion while in recovery. The De Vita Christi written by Ludolph of Saxony inspired Loyola to abandon his previous worldly life and devote himself to labour for God, following the example of spiritual leaders such as Francis of Assisi. He experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus while at the shrine of Our Lady of Montserrat in March 1522. Thereafter he went to Manresa, where he began praying for seven hours a day, often in a nearby cave, while formulating the fundamentals of the Spiritual Exercises. In September 1523, Loyola reached the Holy Land to settle there, but was sent back to Europe by the Franciscans. Between 1524 and 1537, Ignatius studied theology and Latin in Spain and then in Paris. In 1534, he arrived in the latter city during a period of anti-Protestant turmoil which forced John Calvin to flee France. Ignatius and a few followers bound themselves by vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. In 1539, they formed the Society of Jesus, approved in 1540 by Pope Paul III, as well as his Spiritual Exercises approved in 1548. Loyola also composed the Constitutions of the Society. He died in July 1556, was beatified by Pope Paul V in 1609, canonized by Pope Gregory XV in 1622, and declared patron of all spiritual retreats by Pope Pius XI in 1922. Ignatius' feast day is celebrated on 31 July. Ignatius is a foremost patron saint of soldiers, the Society of Jesus, the Basque Country, and the provinces of Guip√∫zcoa and Biscay. The youngest of 13 children, √ç√±igo was only seven years old when his mother died. In 1506, √ç√±igo adopted the last name \\"de Loyola\\" in reference of the Basque city of Loyola where he was born and later became a page in the service of a relative, Juan Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar, treasurer (contador mayor) of the kingdom of Castile. Jesuit right The Society of Jesus (, S.J., SJ, or SI) is a Catholic male religious order that follows the teachings of the Catholic Church. The members are called Jesuits, and are also known colloquially as \\"God's Marines\\" and as \\"The Company\\", these being references to founder Ignatius of Loyola's military background and the members' willingness to go anywhere in the world and live in extreme conditions. The Society is engaged in evangelization and apostolic ministry in 112 nations on six continents. The Society's founding principles are contained in the document Formula of the Institute, written by Ignatius of Loyola. Jesuits are known for their work in education (founding schools, colleges, universities and seminaries), intellectual research, and cultural pursuits, and for their missionary efforts. Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, and promote social justice and ecumenical dialogue. Ignatius founded the Society after being wounded in battle and experiencing a religious conversion. He composed the Spiritual Exercises to help others follow the teachings of Jesus Christ In 1534, Ignatius and six other young men, including St. Francis Xavier and Bl. Pierre Favre, gathered and professed vows of poverty, chastity, and later obedience, including a special vow of obedience to the Pope. Rule 13 of Ignatius' Rules for Thinking with the Church said: \\"That we may be altogether of the same mind and in conformity[...], if [the Church] shall have defined anything to be black which to our eyes appears to be white, we ought in like manner to pronounce it to be black.\\" Ignatius' plan of the order's organization was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540 by the bull containing the Formula of the Institute. The opening lines of this founding document would declare that the Society of Jesus was founded to \\"strive especially for the propagation and defense of the faith and progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine.\\"Formula The Society participated in the Counter-Reformation and later in the implementation of the Second Vatican Council in the Catholic Church. The Society of Jesus is consecrated under the patronage of Madonna Della Strada, a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and it is led by a Superior General, currently Adolfo Nicol√°s.africa.reuters.com, Spaniard becomes Jesuits' new \\"black pope\\" The headquarters of the Society, its General Curia, is in Rome.

Sebasti Raj The Madurai Province includes the entire State of Tamil Nadu. It is led by Fr. Sebasti L. Raj, S.J., whose office is in Dindigul. Some of more prominent institutions of the Jesuit Madurai Province are: St. Joseph's School and St. Joseph's College, Tiruchy (1844), St. Mary's School, Dindigul (1850), St. Mary's School, Madurai (1855), St. Xavier's School (1880) and College (1923), Playamkottai, St. Francis Xavier School, Tuticorin (1884), Loyola College, Chennai (1925), De Britto School, Devakottai (1943), and St. Xavier's College of Education, Palayamkottai (1950). The Jesuits run 15 colleges and 11 secondary schools in Tamil Nadu. =History of Madurai Province= right Why would the Jesuits of Tamil Nadu call their Province the Madurai Province? The reasons are historical. Incidentally quite a few Indian Jesuit provinces have names of cities like Bombay, Patna, Jamshedpur and Ranchi. Others ‚Äì like Andhra, Kerala and Gujarat ‚Äì have the names of States. Madurai Province is the oldest Province in India. Jesuit presence in this land of Tamils began since the times of St Francis Xavier. He arrived in Goa on 6 May 1542 and, after four months of stay in Goa, travelled to Tamil Nadu and worked in Manapad, Tuticorin, Madurai and Madras-Mylapore, preaching the good news of Jesus and founding Catholic communities. After Francis Xavier came Antony Criminali (1520‚Äì1549) who was later killed by the Badagas in a raid near Vedalai, Ramnad District,Tamil Nadu. Henri Henriques (1520‚Äì1600), Goncalo Fernandez (1541‚Äì1621), Robert de Nobili (1577‚Äì1656) and others were sent from Goa to the Tamil region to continue the work of evangelisation About the school St. Mary's Cathedral St. Mary's occupies a large area in the heart of Dindigul, five minutes from the bus stand. The Hostel is just opposite the school gate. The environment of the school includes green, spacious grounds and multiple sports fields. The school contains numerous houses: Main Building or Clock House (built in the British period), Jubilee Hall Block, Central Stage with staff rooms, offices, and library, and Fathers House. In 2010 an Engineering Class Block was added. Besides sports, extracurriculars include drama, handwriting competition, poetry, music, NSS, NCC, JRC, Scouting, and National Green Secretaries for Students. =Branches= Admission to 6th and 9th Standard is by Entrance Exam. St. Mary's Higher Secondary School provides four branches for class XI & XII: Computer Science, Biology (with maths and physics), Accounting & Commerce, and Vocational Group (EMR, Textile, EDA, Sports). Generally all students of St. Mary's School pass the X (SSLC) exam. What branch they continue in depends on their marks in this exam. Classes XI and XII have room for additional students but the earlier classes are filled mainly by Christians and by the poor, since it was for them that the school was founded.

He survived the Bataan Death March and participated in the only successful mass escape from a Japanese prison camp. Grashio was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in September 1940. After training, he was sent to the Philippines, arriving in Manila on November 20, 1941, to join the 24th Pursuit Group's 21st Pursuit Squadron as a second lieutenant. On December 8, the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor (on the other side of the International Date Line), he flew from Nichols Field to engage in aerial combat against the Japanese in his Curtis P-40E fighter airplane. Along with the rest of the 24th Group, he ended up at Bataan, where he flew the last combat mission on April 8, 1942. The Battle of Bataan ended the next day with an Allied surrender. Grashio joined the other prisoners of war in the infamous Bataan Death March. He was imprisoned first at Camp O'Donnell, north of Manila. Two months later, he was transferred to a camp at Cabanatuan. Finally, in October, he was among 1000 prisoners judged fit to work; they were moved to a lumber camp on Mindanao (Davao Region) to engage in manual labor. Grashio and his squadron commander, Lieutenant Ed Dyess, eight other Americans, including Austin Shofner,Dyess, W.E., 1944, The Dyess Story, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons and two Filipinos escaped into the jungle on Sunday, April 4, 1943. One of the other Americans was USMC Lt. Jack Hawkins, who had organized the escape. After wandering for three days in the swamp, they contacted a band of Filipino guerrillas. They then joined the Mindanao guerrillas under the command of Lt. Col. Wendell Fertig. Over the course of the next few months, seven of the men were transported a few at a time by submarine to Australia while three stayed behind to continue fighting with the guerrillas. One of these, an Army Air Corps engineering officer by the name of Leo Boelens, was eventually killed by the Japanese. Grashio and Luis Morgan escaped to Australia via submarine.Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, Grashio was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star with cluster during the war.

The battles were a part of the India-Pakistan War and the Bangladesh Liberation War. The series of naval operations began with the Indian Navy exerting pressure from the seas, while the Indian Army and Indian Air Force moved in to close the ring round East Pakistan on land. The naval operations incorporated the naval interdiction, air defence, ground support, and logistics missions. With the success of the Indian Navy's operations in East Pakistan, the Indian Navy commenced two large-scale operations, Operation Trident and Operation Python on the Western front, prior to the start of formal conflict between India and Pakistan. Background The Indian Navy did not play a major role during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 as the war focused on land-based conflict. On 7 September, a flotilla of the Pakistan Navy under the command of Commodore S.M. Anwar carried out a bombardment, Operation Dwarka, of the Indian Navy's radar station of Dwarka, south of the Pakistani port of Karachi. While there was no damage to the radar station, this operation caused the Indian Navy to undergo a rapid modernization and expansion. Consequently, the Indian Navy budget grew from 350 million to 1.15 billion. The Indian Navy added a squadron to its combatant fleet by acquiring six s from the Soviet Union. The Indian Naval Air Arm was also strengthened. Pakistani Navy in East Pakistan The Eastern Command was established in 1969 and Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff (later four-star Admiral) was made naval commander in that region. Admiral Shariff administratively ran the Navy, and was credited for leading the administrative operations. Under his command, SSG(N), Pakistan Marines and SEAL teams were established, running both covert and overt operations in the Eastern Command. The Pakistan Naval Forces had inadequate ships to challenge the Indian Navy on both fronts, and the PAF was unable to protect these ships from the Indian Air Force and Indian Naval Air Arm. Furthermore, Chief of Naval Staff of Pakistan Navy, Vice-Admiral Muzaffar Hassan, had ordered the navy to deploy all naval power on the Western Front. Most of the Pakistan Navy's combatant vessels were deployed in West Pakistan and only one destroyer, PNS Sylhet, was assigned in East Pakistan, on the personal request of Admiral Shariff. Locations of Pakistan Navy's Combatant forces on December 1971 in and around East Pakistan. Some unit locations are not shown. Map not to exact scale. During the conflict, East Pakistan's naval ports were left defenceless as the Eastern Command of Pakistan had decided to fight the war without the navy. Faced with overwhelming opposition, the navy planned to remain in the ports when war broke out.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p 135 In the eastern wing, the Pakistan Navy heavily depended on her gun boat squadron.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p134 The Pakistan's Eastern Naval Command was in direct command of Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff who also served as the right-hand of Lieutenant- General Niazi. The Pakistan Navy had 4 gun boats (PNS Jessore, Rajshahi, Comilla, and Sylhet). The boats were capable of attaining maximum speed of 20 knots (37 km/h), were crewed by 29 sailors. Known as Pakistan Navy's brown water navy, the gun boats were equipped with various weapons, including heavy machine guns. The boats were adequate for patrolling and anti-insurgency operations but they were hopelessly out of place in conventional warfare.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p135 In the early of April, the Pakistan Navy began naval operations around East Pakistan to support the Army's execution of Operation Searchlight. Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff had coordinated all of these missions. On 26 April, the Pakistan Navy successfully completed Operation Barisal, but it resulted in the temporary occupation of city of Barisal. Bloody urban guerrilla warfare ensued and Operation Jackpot severely damaged the operational capability of Pakistan Navy. Before the start of the hostilities, all naval gun boats were stationed at the Chittagong.Bangladesh at War, Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M. Bir Uttam, p 211 As the air operations began, the IAF aircraft damaged the Rajshahi, while the Comilla was sunk on 4 December. On 5 December, the IAF sank two patrol boats in Khulna. The PNS Sylhet was destroyed on 6 December and the Balaghat on 9 December by Indian aircraft. On 11 December, the PNS Jessore was destroyed, while Rajshahi was repaired. The Rajashahi under the command of Lieutenant- Commander Sikandar Hayat managed to evade the Indian blockade and reach Malaysia before the surrender on 16 December. Naval operations in the Eastern theatre Vikrant played a key role in enforcing a naval blockade over East Pakistan The Indian Navy started covert naval operations, which were part of a larger operation named Operation Sea Sight which were executed successfully. In the end months of 1971, the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command had effectively applied a naval blockade that completely isolated East Pakistan's Bay of Bengal, trapping the Eastern Pakistan Navy and eight foreign merchant ships in their ports. The Pakistan Army's Combatant High Command, The GHQ, insisted and pressured the Pakistan Navy to deploy PNS Ghazi and to extend its sphere of naval operations into East Pakistan shores. The Officer in Command of Submarine Service Branch of Pakistan Navy opposed the idea of deploying an aging submarine, PNS Ghazi, in the Bay of Bengal. It was difficult to sustain prolonged operations in a distant area in the total absence of repair, logistics, and recreational facilities in the vicinity. At this time, submarine repair facilities were absent at Chittagong, the only sea port in the east during this period. Her commander and other officers objected the plan as when it was proposed by the senior Army and Naval officers. In the Eastern wing of Pakistan, the Pakistan Navy had never maintained a squadron of warships, despite the calls made by Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff. Instead, a brown water navy was formed consisting a gun boats riverine craft on a permanent basis. Consequently, in eastern wing, repair and logistic facilities were not developed at Chittagong. The Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command virtually faced no opposition from Eastern theatre. The aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, along with her escort LST ships INS Guldar, INS Gharial, INS Magar, and the submarine INS Khanderi, executed their operations independently. On 4 December 1971, the aircraft carrier was also deployed and its Hawker Sea Hawk attack aircraft contributed to Air Operations in East Pakistan. The aircraft successfully attacked many coastal towns in East Pakistan including Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar. The continuous attacks later destroyed the PAF's capability to retaliate.IAF claim of PAF Losses Ghazi was the only long range submarine operated by either of the warring nations in 1965. The sinking of PNS Ghazi played a point of turning role in Indian Naval operations in East Pakistan The Pakistan Navy responded by deploying her ageing long-range submarine, PNS Ghazi, to counter the threat as the Naval Command had overruled the objections by her officers. The PNS Ghazi, under the command of Commander Zafar Muhammad Khan, was assigned to locate the INS Vikrant, but when it was not able to locate, decided to mine the port of Visakhapatnam ‚Äì the headquarters of Eastern Naval Command.Mihir K. Roy (1995) War in the Indian Ocean, Spantech & Lancer. The Indian Navy's Naval Intelligence laid a trap to sink the submarine by giving fake reports about the aircraft carrier. At around midnight of 3‚Äì4 December, the PNS Ghazi began its operation of laying mines. The Indian Navy dispatched to counter the threat. The INS Rajput's sonar radar reported the disturbance underwater and two depth charges were released. The deadly game ended when the submarine sank mysteriously while laying a mine with all 92 hands on board around midnight on 3 December 1971 off the Visakhapatnam coast.Till, Geoffrey (2004). Seapower: a guide for the twenty- first century. Great Britain: Frank Cass Publishers. p. 179. . Retrieved 2010-05-28. The sinking of Ghazi turned out to be a major blow and setback for Pakistani naval operations in East Pakistan.Shariff, Admiral (retired) Mohammad, Admiral's Diary, pp140 It diminished the possibility of Pakistan carrying out large scale of naval operations in the Bay of Bengal. It also eliminated the threat posed by the Pakistan Navy to Indian Eastern Naval Command. On reconnaissance mission, the Ghazi was ordered to report back to her garrison on 26 November, and admitted a report Naval Combatant Headquarter, NHQ. However, it was failed to return to her garrison. Anxiety grew day by day at the NHQ and NHQ had pressed frantic efforts to establish communications with the submarine failed to produce results. By 3 December prior to starting of the war, the doubts about the fate of submarine had already begun to agitate the commanders at the Naval Headquarter (NHQ). On 5/6 December 1971, naval air operations were carried out Chittagong, Khulna, and Mangla harbours, and at ships in the Pussur river. The oil installations were destroyed at Chittagong, and the Greek merchant ship Thetic Charlie was sunk at the outer anchorage. On 7/8 December, the airfields of PAF were destroyed, and the campaign continued until 9 December. On 12 December, Pakistan Navy laid mines on amphibious landing approaches to Chittagong. This proved a useful trap for some time, and it had denied any direct access to Chittagong port for a long time, even after the instrument of surrender had been signed. The Indian Navy therefore decided to carry out an amphibious landing at Cox's Bazar with the aim cutting off the line of retreat for Pakistan Army troops. On 12 December, additional amphibious battalion was aboard on INS Vishwa Vijaya was sailed from Calcutta port. On the night of 15/16 December, the amphibious landing was carried out, immediately after IAF bombardment of the beach a day earlier. After fighting for days, the human cost was very high for Pakistani forces, and no opposition or resistance was offered by Pakistani forces to Indian forces. During this episode Eastern theatre Indian forces suffered only 2 deaths in the operation. Meanwhile, Pakistani forces were reported to have suffered hundreds of deaths. By the dawn of 17 December, the Indian Navy was free to operate at will in the Bay of Bengal. Furthermore, the successful Indian Air Operations and Operation Jackpot, led by the Bengali units with the support of Indian Army, undermined the operational capability of Pakistan Navy. Many naval officers (mostly Bengalis) had defected from the Navy and fought against the Pakistan Navy.Operation Jackpot, Mahmud, Sezan, p 14 By the time Pakistan Defence Forces surrendered, the Navy had suffered heavy damage as almost all of the gun boats, destroyer (PNS Sylhet), and the long-range submarine, PNS Ghazi, were lost in the conflict, including their officers. Aliz√© aircraft takes off from Indian carrier Vikrant On 16 December, at 16:13hrs, Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff surrendered his Naval Command to Vice-Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. His TT Pistol is still placed in \\"cover glass\\" where his name is printed in big golden letters at the Indian Military Academy's Museum. In 1972, U.S. Navy's Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Indian Navy's Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda also paid him a visit with basket of fruits and cakes which initially surprised him, and was concern of his health. While meeting with them, Admiral Shariff summed up that: Sinking of INS Khukri INS Khukri As the Indian military offensive in East Pakistan increased, the Pakistan Navy had dispatched her entire submarine squadron on both fronts. Codename Operation Falcon, the Pakistan Navy began their reconnaissance submarine operations by deploying PNS Hangor, a Daphn√© class submarine, near the coastal water of West-Pakistan, and PNS Ghazi, Tench class long range submarine, near the coastal areas of East-Pakistan. The submarine Hangor sank INS Khurki, an ASW frigate of the Indian Navy. According to the Lieutenant R. Qadri, an Electrical engineer officer at Hangor during the time, the assigned mission was considered quite difficult and highly dangerous, with the submarine squadron sailing under the assumption that the dangerous nature of this mission meant a great mortal risk to the submarine and her crew. On the midnight of 21 November 1971, PNS Hangor, under the command of Commander Ahmed Tasnim, began her reconnaissance operations. Both PNS Ghazi and PNS Hangor maintained coordination and communication throughout patrol operations. On 2 and 3 December, Hangor had detected a large formation of ships from Indian Navy's Western fleet which included cruiser INS Mysore. Hangor had passed an intelligence to Pakistan naval forces of a possible attack by the observed Indian Armada near Karachi. The Indian Naval Intelligence intercepted these transmissions, and dispatched two ASW frigates, INS Khukri and the INS Kirpan of 14th Squadron ‚Äì Western Naval Command. On 9 December 1971, at 1957 hours, Hangor sunk Khukri with two homing torpedoes. According to her commander, the frigate sank within the matter of two minutes. The frigate sank with 192 hands on board. Hangor also attacked the INS Kirpan on two separate occasions, but the torpedoes had missed their target. Kirpan quickly disengaged and successfully evaded the fired torpedoes. Attack on Karachi An Indian Killer squadron missile boat that participated in the attack On 4 December, the Indian Navy, equipped with P-15 Termit anti-ship missiles, launched Operation Trident against the port of Karachi. During this time, Karachi was home to the Headquarters of the Pakistan Navy as well as the backbone of Pakistan's economy. Karachi was also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, meaning that a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan's economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any airstrikes or naval strikes. Karachi received some of the best defences Pakistan had to offer as well as cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area. The Indian fleet lay 250 miles from Karachi during the day, outside the range of Pakistani aircraft, and most of these aircraft did not possess night- bombing capability. The Pakistani Navy had launched submarine operations to gather intelligence on Indian naval efforts. Even so, with multiple intelligence reports by the submarines, the Navy had failed to divert the naval attacks, due to misleading intelligence and communications. The Indian Navy's preemptive strike resulted in an ultimate success. The Indian missile ships successfully sunk the minesweeper PNS Muhafiz, the destroyer and the MV Venus Challenger which, according to Indian sources, was carrying ammunition for Pakistan from the United States forces in Saigon. The destroyer PNS Shah Jahan was damaged beyond repair. The missile ships also bombed the Kemari oil storage tanks of the port which were burnt and destroyed causing massive loss to the Karachi Harbour. Operation Trident was an enormous success with no physical damage to any of the ships in the Indian task group, which returned safely to their garrison. Masroor Air Force Base (Click to enlarge). Pakistan Airforce retaliated to these attacks by bombing Okha harbour scoring direct hits on fuelling facilities for missile boats, ammunition dump and the missile boats jetty. Indians were ready for this and had already moved the missile boats to other locations to prevent any losses. But the destruction of the special fuel tank prevented any further incursions until Operation Python. On the way back from the bombing the PAF aircraft encountered an Aliz√© 203 Indian aircraft and shot it down. On 6 December, a false alarm by a Pakistani Fokker aircraft carrying naval observers caused a friendly fire confrontation between Pakistan's Navy and Air Force. A PAF jet mistakenly strafed the frigate PNS Zulfikar, breaking off shortly after the ship got itself recognised by frantic efforts. The crew suffered some casualties besides the damage to ship. The ship was taken back to port for repair. The Indian Navy launched a second large-scale operation on the midnight of 8 and 9 December 1971. The operation, codenamed Operation Python, was commenced under the command of Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy Admiral S.M. Nanda. The INS Vinash, a missile boat, and two multipurpose frigates, and participated in the operation. The attack squadron approached Karachi and fired four missiles. During the raid, the Panamanian vessel Gulf Star and the British ship SS Harmattan were sunk and Pakistan Navy's Fleet Tanker received heavy damage. More than 50% of Karachi's total fuel reserves were destroyed in the attack. More than $3 billion worth of economic and social sector damage was inflicted by the Indian Navy. Most of Karachi's oil reserves were lost and warehouses and naval workshops destroyed. The operation damaged the Pakistani economy and hindered the Pakistan Navy's operations along the western coast. Ending After the successful operations by Indian Navy, India had established complete control over the oil route from the Persian Gulf to Pakistani ports. The Pakistani Navy's main ships were either destroyed or forced to remain in port. A partial naval blockade was imposed by the Indian Navy on the port of Karachi and no merchant ship could approach Karachi. Shipping traffic to and from Karachi, Pakistan's only major port at that time, ceased. Within a few days after the attacks on Karachi, the Eastern fleet of Indian Navy had success over the Pakistani forces in East Pakistan. By the end of the war, the Indian Navy controlled the seas around both the wings of Pakistan. The War ended for both the fronts after the Instrument of Surrender of Pakistani forces stationed in East Pakistan was signed at Ramna Race Course in Dhaka at 16.31 IST on 16 December 1971, by Lieutenant General A. A. K. Niazi, Commander of Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and accepted by Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora, General Officer Commanding-in-chief of Eastern Command of the Indian Army. The damage inflicted on the Pakistani Navy stood at 7 gunboats, 1 minesweeper, 1 submarine, 2 destroyers, 3 patrol craft belonging to the coast guard, 18 cargo, supply and communication vessels, and large scale damage inflicted on the naval base and docks in the coastal town of Karachi. Three merchant navy ships ‚Äì Anwar Baksh, Pasni and Madhumathi ‚Äì and ten smaller vessels were captured. Around 1900 personnel were lost, while 1413 servicemen were captured by Indian forces in Dhaka. According to one Pakistan scholar, Tariq Ali, the Pakistan Navy lost a third of its force in the war. Admiral Shariff wrote in a 2010 thesis that \\"the generals in Air Force and Army, were blaming each other for their failure whilst each of them projected them as hero of the war who fought well and inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing Indians\\". At the end, each general officers in the Air Force and Army placed General Niazi's incompetency and failure as responsible for causing the war, Sharif concluded.

He served as the bishop of Ross and Caithness for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Life Forbes was born in 1708 at Rayne in Aberdeenshire, where his father was schoolmaster. He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen (A.M. 1726). In 1735 he went to Edinburgh, was ordained priest by Bishop David Freebairn, and was shortly appointed minister of the episcopal congregation at Leith, a town which was his home for the rest of his life. In his room there, in 1740, John Skinner received baptism at his hands. On 7 September 1745, when Charles Edward Stuart was on his descent from the Highlands, Forbes was one of three episcopal clergymen who were arrested at St. Ninians, near Stirling, suspected of intending to join the rebels, confined in Stirling Castle till 4 February 1746, and in Edinburgh Castle until 29 May. In 1762 the episcopal clergy of Ross and Caithness elected him their bishop, and he was consecrated at Forfar on 24 June by the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, William Falconer, with Bishops Andrew Gerard and Alexander. He continued to live at Leith, but made two visitations of his northern flock in 1762 and 1770. In 1764 he had a new church built for him, where he gathered a good congregation; but he would not ‚Äòqualify‚Äô according to law, and he was soon reported to government. Soldiers were sent to his meeting to see whether he prayed for King George III, and he was summoned before the colonel-commanding (Dalrymple). An account of the interview that ensued is preserved in his third ‚ÄòJournal.‚Äô He made no submission, but thought it better to have his services without singing; and, receiving advice from a friend, he went for some weeks to London. There he worshipped with the remnant of the nonjurors, and received from their bishop Robert Gordon a staff that had once belonged to George Hickes. In the same year he was at a meeting of Jacobites at Moffat, when proposals were discussed for the continuance of the Stuart line and the Stuart pretensions by marrying Charles Edward to a Protestant. On the death of Gerard, Forbes was elected bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney in 1765, but difficulties arose and he declined the appointment. Forbes died at Leith 18 November 1775, and was buried in the Maltman's aisle of South Leith parish church. Works Forbes began about 1760 to write in the Edinburgh Magazine, his articles being chiefly topographical and antiquarian. He took part in updating the communion office of the Scottish Episcopal Church, the editions of 1763, 1764, and 1765 being printed under his supervision. The Journals of his episcopal visitations were edited in 1886 by James Brown Craven. In the bishop's own lifetime appeared An Essay on Christian Burial, and the Respect due to Burying-Grounds, by a ‚ÄòRuling Elder of the Church of Scotland‚Äô (1765), and an Account of the Chapel of Roslin (1774). His major work is the ‚ÄòLyon in Mourning,‚Äô ten octavo volumes in manuscript, bound in black, and filled with collections relative to the Jacobite Rising of 1745 with which are bound up a number of relics of the same expedition. Among those interviewed in detail for the project was the Scottish Gaelic poet and Jacobite propagandist Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair. The volumes date from 1747 to 1775; extracts from them were published (1834) under the title of Jacobite Memoirs, by Robert Chambers, from the originals in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. An edition appeared in 1895: The Lyon in Mourning, edited by Henry Paton, Scottish History Society, Edinburgh. Family He was twice married. His second wife, Rachel, daughter of Ludovick Houston of Johnstone, was as enthusiastic a Jacobite as her husband. The bishop permitted favoured guests to drink out of Prince Charlie's brogues; she sent to the ‚Äòroyal exile‚Äô the seed-cake which Oliphant of Gask presented to him.

Rama Rao, popularly known as NTR, as President of national front and V. P. Singh as Convener. The coalition's prime minister was V. P. Singh later succeeded by Chandra Shekhar. The parties in the Front were: Janata Dal at national level, Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam of Tamil Nadu, and Asom Gana Parishad of Assam and Indian Congress (Socialist). They were supported from outside by the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Leader of the Opposition, P. Upendra was a General Secretary of the Front at its formation. In 1991, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha became a part of the Front. TDP split in 1995, with a minority faction siding with N. T. Rama Rao and the majority faction choosing to side with Chandrababu Naidu. The Front collapsed before the Lok Sabha elections of 1996, when NF tried to rope in both DMK and AIADMK, resulting in the DMK walking out. After NTR died of a heart attack in January 1996, Janata Dal stood by Rama Rao's widow Lakshmi Parvathi while Left parties formed an alliance with Chandrababu naidu. United Front (1996‚Äì1998) After the 1996 elections, Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Telugu Desam Party, Asom Gana Parishad, All India Indira Congress (Tiwari), Left Front (4 parties), Tamil Maanila Congress, National Conference, and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party formed a 13 party United Front (UF). The coalition formed two governments in India between 1996 and 1998. The Prime Minister was first from Janata Dal - H. D. Deve Gowda, then later succeeded by I. K. Gujral, after Jyoti Basu, N. Chandrababu Naidu and V. P. Singh declined to become the Prime Minister. Both governments were supported from outside by the Indian National Congress under Sitaram Kesri. N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party served as the convener of United Front. The Indian general election in 1996 returned a fractured verdict. With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the largest party, with 161 of 543 seats, it was invited first to form a government. It accepted the offer, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister. However, he was unable to muster a majority on the floor of the house, and the government fell 13 days later. At a meeting of all the other parties, the Indian National Congress, with a substantial 140 seats, declined to head the government and along with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), agreed to extend outside support to a coalition with the Janata Dal at its head, named the \\"United Front\\". Other members of the front included the Samajwadi Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Asom Gana Parishad, Tamil Maanila Congress, Communist Party of India and Telugu Desam Party. With the approval of the Congress and CPI(M), the sitting Chief Minister of Karnataka, H. D. Deve Gowda, was asked to head the coalition as Prime Minister after V. P. Singh, Chandra babu Naidu and Jyoti Basu declined. His term was from 1 June 1996 ‚Äì 21 April 1997. The Congress revoked its support to Deve Gowda amidst discontent over communication between the coalition and the Congress. It compromised to support a new government under I. K. Gujral, who was Prime Minister from 21 April 1997 ‚Äì 19 March 1998. Following the collapse of his government, fresh elections were called, and the United Front lost power.  Federal Front (2019)  In March 2018, Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee and Chief Minister of Telangana K. Chandrashekhar Rao called for a coalition urging all regional parties to form a \\"Federal Front\\" for the 2019 Indian general election. While Rao indicated a non-BJP non-Congress coalition, Banerjee avoided a direct answer. On 19 January 2019, opposition leaders from across the country, including former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, Karnataka Chief Minister H.D.Kumaraswamy, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as well as Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader M. K. Stalin, Bahujan Samaj Party Secretary-General Satish Chandra Mishra, Jammu and Kashmir National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Hemant Soren, Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav, All India United Democratic Front leader Badruddin Ajmal, former Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh Gegong Apang, former Union Ministers Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha and BJP rebel MP Shatrughan Sinha assembled in Kolkata for the United India rally organised by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in the first major show of strength of the newly-minted Mahagathbandhan alliance for the 2019 Indian general election. It was unclear whether the Indian National Congress (INC), currently India's largest opposition party, would be a part of this alliance, as INC President Rahul Gandhi did not appear at the United India rally. Instead, Gandhi sent the floor leader of the INC in the Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, to attend the rally on his behalf.

Biography Knerr was born on May 30, 1887, in Fairfield, Iowa. He died on October 26, 1971, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Career Knerr graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1908 and served as an ensign in the United States Navy until 1911. He commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps of the United States Army on September 28, 1911. After seven years service in which he reached the rank of captain, he was detailed to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps in January 1918 during World War I. For six months, Knerr served as an engineering officer at flying training fields in Tennessee and Florida. He was sent to Hawaii in July 1918, where he was Aviation Officer to the Hawaiian Department and commanding officer of Luke Field until July 1919, when he returned to the Coast Artillery during the demobilization following the war. In February 1922 he was detailed again to the Air Service in the grade of major. In February 1924 he formally transferred to the Air Service to qualify for command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Wilbur Wright Field, Ohio. In 1926, the Air Service became the Air Corps. In September 1927, Knerr was appointed to command its sole bombardment unit, the 2nd Bombardment Group, at Langley Field, Virginia, where he had a profound influence on the development of equipment, and tactics that led to the development of strategic bombardment doctrine. Knerr followed Lt. Col. Henry H. Arnold as Chief, Field Service Section, Air Corps Materiel Division, at Wright Field, Ohio, in 1932. Arnold called upon his expertise in both engineering and bomber operations, to be his executive officer in July 1934 of a squadron-sized flight from Bolling Field to Alaska and back, using the new Martin B-10 bomber. Knerr supervised the preparation of the bombers at nearby Patterson Field and acted as Arnold's second-in-command during the flight. The flight won the MacKay Trophy for that year, in large part as a result of Knerr's judgment in technical decisions. Arnold, as leader of the flight, won acclaim almost to the exclusion of the other participants, and received an award of the Distinguished Flying Cross. However, despite Arnold's recommendations, that all participants in the flight be recognized with the decoration, only Arnold received it, causing a permanent rift between the two and Knerr's permanent embitterment. Knerr led a faction opposing Arnold's appointment to Chief of Air Corps in September 1938. On March 2, 1935, Knerr received an assignment promotion (temporary), to colonel when he was made chief of staff of the newly activated General Headquarters Air Force under Maj. Gen. Frank M. Andrews. After three tumultuous years of political in- fighting with the War Department General Staff, over doctrine and the development of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Andrews' staff was purged of its members by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Malin Craig in February 1938. Knerr was sent to Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, as Air Officer, Eighth Corps Area, where Billy Mitchell (whose theories on air warfare were the basis for the doctrine of strategic bombardment and an Air Force separate from the Army advocated by Knerr) had been exiled 13 years earlier. A stress-induced recurrence of sciatica linked to a crash in 1923 resulted in forced hospitalization for the remainder of 1938. In January 1939, Knerr was compelled to appear before the Army's retirement board, where its psychiatrist characterized the condition as \\"psychosomatic.\\" He was retired medically in March 1939. At the same time Andrews, whose advocacy of strategic bombardment and an independent Air Force were as strong as Knerr's, was not reappointed to a second tour as commanding general of GHQ Air Force. Reduced to his permanent rank of colonel, Andrews followed Knerr as Air Officer in San Antonio. In private life, Knerr went to work for the Sperry Corporation Research Laboratories, wrote numerous magazine articles advocating his positions, and conducted a letter-writing campaign against Arnold between 1939 and 1941. In the meantime, he was cleared by physicians at Walter Reed Army Hospital of the previous medical conclusions of the retirement board. Andrews, again a general and commander of the Panama Canal Air Force, asked for Knerr's recall to active duty and assignment to him as his maintenance commander. Arnold, now Chief of the Army Air Forces, was initially reluctant, because of the many public and private criticisms Knerr had made of him, but agreed to the return to active duty in August 1941. However the Army's Surgeon General, referring to the supposed psychological reasons for his retirement, rejected the reinstatement on medical grounds. After the United States entered World War II, Knerr was called back to active duty as a colonel in July 1942. He served as deputy commander of the Air Service Command at Patterson AAB until July 1943, when he was promoted to brigadier general and sent to England on Arnold's recommendation. At that time, the Combined Bomber Offensive was being hindered by a low rate of aircraft availability because of maintenance and supply problems, and Knerr was sent to re-organize the system. He acted as both Deputy Commanding General and Commanding General of the VIII Service Command, Eighth Air Force; then from January 1945 as Commander, Air Technical Service Command Europe, which was responsible for all support to both the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces. Additionally, he was promoted to major general in March 1944, and after the invasion of Europe in June 1944, held the position of Deputy Commander for Administration, U.S. Strategic Air Forces, Europe in addition to his other duties. In June 1945, he returned to Wright Field to command the Army Air Forces' Air Technical Service Command until February 1946. Following the war he transferred to the newly formed Air Force. Later assignments included serving as a special assistant to U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington and Inspector General of the Air Force. His retirement was effective as of November 1, 1949. Awards he received include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star Medal.

There is one recognised variety, Quercus pungens var. vaseyana, the Vasey shin oak. Sandpaper oak hybridizes with gray oak (Quercus grisea) in the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico and Texas.Gehlbach, Frederick R. 1967. Vegetation of the Guadalupe Escarpment, New Mexico-Texas. Ecology. 48(3): 404-419. Distribution Sandpaper and Vasey shin oaks are abundant in the Edwards Plateau and the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. They also occur in the Guadalupe Mountains and westward to the mountains of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, and in northern and eastern Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Veracruz).SEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter Description The sandpaper oak can be a small tree of up to 40 feet (12 meters) high or a large shrub that forms thickets. The bark is light brown and papery. The twigs are gray, with short velvety hairs, becoming smooth with age. The buds are dark red-brown, sparsely covered with hairs. The leathery leaves are semi-evergreen, being bright glossy green at first but turning darker with age. It is their rough texture, caused by minute persistent hair bases, that gives the tree its name of sandpaper oak. The inflorescence, which appears in spring, is reddish, the female catkins having one to three flowers and the male catkins numerous flowers. The acorn cups are shallow and covered with dense gray hairs. The acorns grow singly or in pairs and are light brown, broadly ovoid with a rounded apex. Habitat The preferred habitat of these oaks is on dry limestone or igneous slopes at a height of 800‚Äì2000 meters (2660‚Äì6670 feet) above sea level, in chaparral and desert scrub savanna, usually in communities of oak, juniper and pinyon pine. In the chaparral formations in the Guadalupe Mountains, it is one of the dominant species and is found growing alongside true mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus) and desert ceanothus (Ceanothus greggii). Other plants associated with it include the Mohr shin oak (Quercus mohriana), oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), purplefruited pricklypear (Opuntia phaeacantha), Mexican buckeye (Ungnadia speciosa), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum) and plateau oak (Quercus fusiformis).Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. 1992.

On this day, a group of applicants who have applied for a particular role are invited to an assessment centre, where a combination of selection techniques are used by the employers to measure the suitability of an individual for the job role. These selection technique usually include exercises such as presentation, group exercise, one to one Interview, role play, psychometric test etc. Most large organisations like banks, audit and IT firms use assessment days to recruit the fresh talent in their graduate programmes. With an increase of popularity of assessment days, several training institutes have been formed that prepare candidates for assessment days, for example, Green Turn is a famous institute that prepares candidates for assessment days of big 4 accountancy firms. History There are several examples throughout history, but the term \\"Assessment\\" for recruiting employees was firstly used in World War II by German Army in early 1930s. They used this process to select military officers. The tasks involved certain tests and officers were rated on how well they performed and chosen for selection and promotion accordingly. Dr Simoneit, a German psychologist led the foundation of what became known as 'An Assessment' in German Army. The idea of starting this process was to get a better understanding of why certain officers did not act in the way they had said they would if they were selected or promoted. Further psychological and scientific methods were added to his original work later on by British Government. They recognised the importance of having an assessment day and a War Office Selection was created using its own testing methods. Examples include the Admiralty Interview Board of the Royal Navy and the Board of the British Army. AT&T; created a building for recruiting staff in the 1950s. This was called The Assessment Centre and this was influential on subsequent personnel methods in other businesses.  Purpose  The purpose of having an assessment day is to see how candidates actually behave when they will be put in real work life situations, for example performing an exercise with a group of people under timed conditions. These behaviours will then get compared to the key behavioural criteria which have been specified for that job role. Although the original assessment days were focused on military duties and their specific exercises are unlikely to be used in a commercial or public environment, but it is still important to know that these exercises have been designed to judge the behaviour of an individual in performing a task. Another reason of employers having an assessment day is that, assessment days have a proven track record of finding the most suitable candidates for the job. They are usually attended by a group of candidates normally between 5 and 15 all of whom are being assessed. They are usually held for a full working day and it is important to remember that the assessment day is just a way of finding candidates suitability for the role. One Candidate is not in competition with the other candidates on the assessment day. If every candidate shows the right qualities and competencies the employer is looking for they will hire all of them. If none of the candidates meet the necessary standard, the employer will hire none of them. Assessment day is usually organised by the human resource department of the organisation. There might be other managers of the company in the assessors panel to provide technical input. Larger organisations sometimes also hire or invite their occupational psychologists on the panel to provide professional reviews on the candidate's behaviour. Occasionally, if an assessment day involves role play exercises, some companies bring professional actors to play that part to assess the behaviour of candidates. For example, to play a role of a dissatisfied client. The idea behind this is to create a real life scenario. Some candidates often prefer this idea and find it easier to behave in the way as they would do in real life. Ultimately, the purpose of employers having an assessment day is to measure how well candidates will deal with a situation that they might encounter in the job.  Stages to undertake on Assessment Day  Most popular Assessment Day exercises.Assessment Day involves a list of exercises sometimes tailored to the job role individuals have applied for. Candidates on an assessment day are assessed against a list of competencies: KSA's ‚Äì Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes. On each competency a score is given and this is assessed through a number of activities as explained below: = Group Exercise = The purpose of Group exercise is to test the interpersonal and teamwork skills of an individual and usually involve activities such as debating, discussing ideas and solving a challenging problem. The idea behind these activities is to judge whether the candidate will overpower the group or fade in the background when they have to work with people with different skills set. It is important that candidates remember that they are not necessarily competing with the others in the group but everybody is performing against the company standard. = In-tray Exercise = The results of this exercise illustrate candidate's organizational and prioritizing skills. The test gives the candidates an everyday example of multiple tasks which needs to be assessed and prioritized. This tests time perception and management and gives the assessors an insight into how the candidate will react in a real-world situation. Most in-tray exercises are designed according to the job specification and they test a set of key competencies based on the values of the organization. For example, they focus on the delegation, independence and managing skills. It is vital that candidates think about the job role and competencies that employer is looking for when answering the questions. = Psychometric Test = These tests are used to measure how people differ in their motivation, values, priorities and opinions. They are helpful for employers in analysing the more hidden traits of individuals and give them indication of their preferred working style. They also give an idea to assessors of candidate's current abilities. They can be quite difficult as normally they are performed under timed conditions, therefore it is advisable for candidates to practice before their assessment day. There are many different types of psychometric test but the commonly used by the employers are numerical reasoning test and verbal reasoning test. = Role Play Exercise = A role play is designed according to the job role, it is a fictional scenario, for example, candidates may have to face an angry customer if they have applies for a sales manager role, where one of the assessor will play the part of the angry customer. In this way assessors will challenge the candidates with different cross-questions and reasons behind the answers. Some companies even hire professional actors for role play exercise so the situation will be more close to real life and also they can assess the candidate accurately. = Presentation = Presentation on an assessment day usually tests a candidates ability of how confident he is in presenting ideas in front of a group of people. Some organizations give the topic of presentation in advance that candidates have to prepare, others give the topic on the assessment day and give candidates some time to prepare for it. This demonstrates their capabilities of presenting their finding and analyzing information under timed condition. = One-to-One Interview = This is usually the last stage of assessment day, If candidates have completed all other tasks, this is an ideal opportunity for individuals to ask questions from hiring managers and showcase them their talent and impress them with the research that they have done about the company and its products and services. This is one of the most important aspects of an assessment day as assessors get to know a candidate individually and it has a great impact on the selection process. Assessors on the assessment day only give credit for the knowledge skills and attitudes (KSA's) candidates exhibit during these exercises. They do not normally test the technical knowledge of job role. The final decision of whether to select or reject a candidate mostly depends on the competencies shown in the above activities.  Strengths and Weaknesses  = Strengths = Assessment Days are eminently fair and objective. They allow a broader range of selection methods to be used so therefore they are more accurate than a standard recruitment process. The tests which are used on assessment day gives an insight knowledge of applicant's psychological and social behaviour. The results from these tests, combined with other conventional sources of information plays an important role in selecting the most qualified candidate and also enables organizations in eliminating unsuitable candidates ‚Äì helping the organizations to ensure that they put right people in right roles. Assessment Days test the psychological behaviour of the person as what they can do, not what they know. It tests their ability to apply formal education in a real world situation. A person may have a first class degree but he may not be able to make critical decisions under pressure or lack skills to delegate work to his team. Exercises and Activities involve at an assessment day are highly adaptable for all types of job roles and for all sorts of organizations. For example, can be designed for recruiting community service officers, sales assistants, detectives, IT Consultants, Audit Managers and jailers as well as police officers. Moreover, the cost associated with assessment day is usually lower as compared to the cost involve in many other recruitment processes. Because exercises involve on an assessment day are cost and time friendly and can be tailored to the budget of the organisation. Assessment Days can also play an important role for candidates in terms of providing them with feedback about their strengths and weaknesses, which allows them to improve their skills and abilities for future roles. Assessment Days are also an ideal opportunity for candidates to understand the organisation and job role more closely and help them in making decision whether this is the right job role for them. = Weaknesses = Assessment Days can be difficult to manage and there is always an uncertainty of things going wrong on the day. There can be system failure or maybe other IT problems that can cause problems in performing various activities, for example, aptitude tests and psychometric tests can not be performed because of an immediate IT failure. Role players may fail to turn up or badly play their roles and therefore assessors may not be able to mark the exercise properly. Furthermore, with an increase in technology people who have been to an assessment day of a company write about their experiences and nature of exercises involved on social websites and student forums which in result give all the answers to future candidates and they prepare themselves in advance which is sometimes not fair for selection process. Sometimes, candidates complain that they feel uncomfortable on an assessment day as they are just \\"role playing\\" and assessors don't get to know \\"the real me\\". Others complain that the time spent with an assessors is too limited for them to make a right decision. Some also argue that exercises that are used for assessment days are too ambiguous and not close to job specification. Moreover, sometimes its hard for an organization to gather all their assessors and managers on the same day as the assessment process is very time-consuming as it can lasts from 4 to 7 hours.  Strategies for Applicants  Applicants should follow the following strategies to succeed an assessment day: * Research about the company, its products and services and if there is any recent news about this company before the assessment day. * Applicants should arrive at least 15 minutes before the starting time, some organisations may want candidates to arrive even early so they can check their documents. * Be polite to everyone and shake hands with everyone, even with other candidates. * Show interest in the discussion and try to mix up with everyone, employers at an assessment day usually judge social behaviour of candidates when they interact with others. * Try to be confident in group exercises, don't overpower the group and try to get others involved in the group discussion as it gives good impression on assessors. * Applicants should request feedback if they have been unsuccessful so they can improve their performance for the next assessment day.

The recipe was developed in laboratories between 1965 and 1967. The company's far-sea fishing activity at that time was located off the coast of West Africa. According to , a co-founder and long- time employee of , the recipe was inspired by \\"chop-chop\\", a West African delicacy sampled by 's fishermen in one of the local ports. The dish contained fish, rice and a hot spice called \\"pima\\". In 1967, Jakacki and his colleagues were issued a certificate for rationalization proposal, which, under communist intellectual property law, awarded them limited property rights to their improvement idea and allowed to put it in place. The first cans of were manufactured in the same year. Originally, contained scraps of various kinds of fish caught off the West African coast, such as red porgy, as well as tomato pulp imported from the southern countries of the Eastern Bloc ‚Äì Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania ‚Äì and a spice imported from Nigeria. The fish component changed with time, as moved its fishing fleet to new locations; at various points, the paste contained Alaska pollock and blue grenadier from the Pacific Ocean or southern blue whiting from the waters around the Falkland Islands. By the end of the 1960s, the company had left the West African waters due to the Nigerian Civil War; in 1977, it moved out of the northern Pacific Ocean when Canada and the United States claimed their exclusive economic zones; and in 1982, it had to abandon the Falkland waters because of the Argentine-British war. Due to its low price and long shelf life, the spread quickly gained popularity among Polish students, artists and hikers. At the turn of the 1980s, amounted to about 50 percent of 's total annual canned fish output of . The product became Poland's export hit that was sold to 32 countries, including C√¥te d'Ivoire, Denmark, Hungary, Japan, Jordan, Liberia, the Soviet Union, Togo and the United States. According to 's internal report, the recipe was copied in Colombia, which exported its own version of the fish spread to neighboring countries. An economic downturn, which hit Poland in the 1980s, resulted in inferior quality of the product. The Nigerian spice was replaced with cheaper Hungarian paprika and the original fish content of 50 percent was reduced in favor of rice. It was common to find fragments of fins, scales and bones in the paste. A slump in the sales of in the mid-1980s was brought about by a public revelation that the meat of the southern blue whiting was heavily infested with Kudoa alliaria, a myxozoan parasite infecting marine fish. Consumers feared that the infected fish, rather than being recalled from the market, was ground and mixed into the ; some people took grains of rice visible in the paste for parasite cysts. During the food shortages of the time, cans of the fish paste often remained on grocery shelves along with vinegar as the only food products available. A slice of bread spread with With Poland's transition from command to market economy in the early 1990s, Polish far-sea fishing business became economically unsustainable, bringing Gryf to bankruptcy. According to Borysowicz, was protected by a patent, but the documents were lost during the company's liquidation. Several other Polish companies tried, without success, to obtain a patent for the same product in the 1990s and 2000s. As a result, both the recipe and the name of are legally unprotected, allowing various producers throughout Poland (all outside Szczecin) to manufacture their own versions of the paste, often using freshwater fish, under the same name. In 2010, the Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development placed on an official list of traditional products, per request from the West Pomeranian regional authorities. While this recognition itself does not grant the recipe any legal protection, it is considered a first step for Szczecin towards having the paste's name and geographic indication protected under European Union law.  In culture  A monument to paprykarz szczeci≈Ñski, in the form of an oversized can, erected in Szczecin in 2020 was one of the most recognizable brands in communist Poland. Due to its popularity and association with the main city of West Pomerania, it has become a part of Szczecin's post-war local identity even though it is no longer produced in this city. The shares this status with another local food product, a meat-filled pastry known as . The word is sometimes humorously used by people from other parts of Poland to refer to inhabitants of Szczecin and particularly to the players and fans of , the local soccer club.

Uncertain Defeats, or Uncertain Courses, narrates about the long initiation of the main character. It deals really with a double journey: the outer journey with its adventures and the inner journey, of memory and reflection. It is the drifting of a marginal and vitalistic man, obsessed with the passage of time. He talks and thinks in first person, giving a certain intimate tone to the story. It is an adventure narration; a man losing his way with no direction and no God. In a tireless search for someone and its subsequent loss. The best about this novel is the dramatic progression, which enthralls the reader. *El impasible mutismo de los dioses, Buenos Aires, C√°lamo, 2004. The Impassive Silence of the Gods, is a story of characters battered by life and circumstances, trying desperately to cling to somebody and settle down hoping to belong somewhere (The topic of solitude is a constant in this author). The ethics of the real life adventurer, an almost amoral being are predominant; even so, rude and vulgar words are dignified as they merge with easiness within the narration. It is a harsh novel, with intimate touches, specially when characters nostalgically recall better situations from past times or when, trapped by feelings in an existence with no way out, imagine and chase a final redeeming reward. *Fabuloso olvido, Buenos Aires, C√°lamo, 2006. Fabled Oblivion, Thanks to an original structure with various intermingled genres, the author gives an account of an investigation about the life of a man who, due to the circumstances protects a defenseless elderly woman. Throughout the novel both lives are intertwined, in a narration filled with reflection and wanderings. This story is ultimately about the big topics of life, and therefore Love, Loneliness, Old age and Death are profusely discussed. = Other Novels = *Las Ma√±anas de la Salamandra, Buenos Aires, C√°lamo 2010. In addition to the Trilogy of the Uprooted, The author as published a novel called The Mornings of the Salamander. It is a reflection of the History of Spain by means of a family saga spanning from the end of the 19th century to the first decade of the 21st century (great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren). It is a collection of the ups and downs of its members, happening both in the mountains and in the city, as well as social and generational changes taking place in the country during the century. The tale is presented in two planes: one set in the present and the other in the past. Past and present unfold thanks to the parade of characters from different generations, fusing with as time passes by. In the meantime the reflections of a hundred-year-old man act as a chorus. The action takes place alternating the city with the hamlet. In certain passages an omniscient narrator whose voice joins with that of the characters, which adds to the variety of the different points of view. *Suite de Oto√±o, Buenos Aires, C√°lamo 2014.

His name is occasionally rendered \\"Konakis\\". He joined the revolt of Heraclius against the emperor Phocas (r. 602-610). He was killed in the subsequent conflict. The main source about him is John of Niki√ª, the relevant text only surviving in Ethiopian translation.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 237  Biography  Bonakis is first mentioned in 609. He was sent by Heraclius to the Pentapolis of Cyrenaica, leading an army consisting of 3,000 Roman (Byzantine) troops and an unknown number of Berbers. His forces joined those of Nicetas. Bonakis, Nicetas and Leontius joined forces to capture the town of Kabsain/Kabsen. John of Niki√ª reports: \\"Heraclius, who distributed large sums of money among the Berbers of Tripolis and Pentapolis, and thereby prevailed on them to help him in the war. Next he summoned the captain of his forces, named Bonakis, with 3,000 men, and a large number of Berbers, and dispatched them to Pentapolis to wait for him there. And he sent likewise Nicetas, the son of Gregory, with large subsidies to the prefect Leontius, who had been appointed to the province of Mareotis by Phocas ... And Bonakis, the chief (captain) of Heraclius, (set out) and he saw Nicetas in Pentapolis as Heraclius had commanded. And he indeed had received troops from Leontius, who had been sent to the province of the Mareotis, and he had proceeded towards Nubia in Africa (?). Now the prefect Leontius had come to terms with them. And when they had met the garrison of the city of Kabsen, they entered but did no violence to the garrison. And they set free all the prisoners that they might join them in the war. And before they entered, they had prevailed on the inhabitants of the city to precede them (and) stir up a tumult on the river, named Pidrakon, that is, the Dragon, which flows close to the great city of Alexandria on the west.\\" John of Nikiu, Chapter CVII (107) Their combined forces marched towards Alexandria next. They were able to defeat the forces loyal to Phocas, kill their unnamed commander and capture the city. The narrative continues: \\"And when they had entered, they found the Balalun, the governor of Alexandria, with a large force of Egyptians arrayed with weapons of war. And they said to him : 'Hearken to our words and flee from us and preserve thy dignity, and remain neutral till thou seest the side which is victorious; and no calamity shall befall thee, and subsequently thou shalt become the Administrator of Egypt; for behold the days of Phocas are at an end.' But he refused to comply with this proposal and said: 'We will fight for the emperor unto death.' And when they engaged [in battle] they slew this misguided man, and cut off his head, and suspending it on a lance they carried it into the city. And not only none could withstand them, but many joined their ranks.\\" Bonakis was able to assemble his troops in Alexandria and secure control of the fleet at the nearby island of Pharos. He took control of Lower Egypt for Heraclius, with little further opposition. \\"And he [Bonakis] sent for his own troops and soldiers, and he sent likewise to Pharos, and had the soldiers who were in the fleet arrested and kept under a close guard. And information was subsequently brought to Bonosus in the city of Caesarea in Palestine that (the rebels) had captured the city of Alexandria and slain the Apulon, and that the inhabitants of that city hated him and were attached to Heraclius. Now previously to the arrival of Bonosus in Egypt, Bonakis met with no reverse, but gained the mastery over all the prefects in Egypt. ... And all the people rejoiced because of the revolt against Phocas. And all the inhabitants of Nakius and the bishop Theodore and all the cities of Egypt joined the revolt. But Paul the prefect of the city of Samnud alone did not join it. He was one of the prefects appointed by Phocas, and he was beloved by all the inhabitants of the city.\\" The arrival of general Bonosus, at the head of forces loyal to Phocas, caused Bonakis to retreat from Alexandria. He first retreated towards Niki√ª. He then chose to attack Bonosus and Paul in the vicinity of Manuf (a local fortress). Bonakis lost the battle. He was captured by his enemies and killed. While this was a setback for Heraclius' revolt, said revolt continued until the deposition of Phocas in 610. John concludes: \\"They had heard news of Bonosus to the effect that he had arrived at the city of Bikuran. And when the party of Plato heard this news, they sent a dispatch to Bonakis in Alexandria to this effect : 'Hasten hither with thy forces ; for Bonosus has arrived in the city of Farma.' And when Bonakis had reached Nakius, Bonosus likewise had already arrived at the city of Athrib, where he found Marcian's troops ready for war. Christodora also, the sister of Aillus (sic), and the troops of Cosmas the son of Samuel (were already there) by land. And he marched to the small branch of the river which proceeds from the main branch, and met with the prefect Paul and his troops. Then Bonakis came to attack Bonosus, and they engaged on the east of the city of Manuf. And in the engagement the forces of Cosmas the son of Samuel prevailed and drove those of Bonakis into the river, and they took Bonakis prisoner and slew him. And Leontius the general and Kudis they put to the sword, and they surrounded a large body of troops, and took them prisoners and threw them into chains. And when Plato and Theodore saw that Bonakis and his men had been slain, they fled to a convent and concealed themselves.\\"  References   Sources  Category:6th-century births Category:609 deaths Category:Byzantine generals Category:Byzantine rebels Category:Byzantines killed in battle Category:7th-century Egyptian people Category:7th-century Byzantine military personnel ","title":"Bonakis"},{"id":"30624064","text":"Perizoma affinitata, the rivulet, is a species of moth of the family Geometridae.

History The original hospital in the city was established in 1877 and the St Lazare Hospital moved in in April 1883. The decree n ¬∞ 57-1090 of October 3, 1957 designated it as the regional hospital of Oran. The ordinance 58-1373 of December 30, 1958, designated it as the \\"Hospital and University Center of Oran\\". In Albert Camus‚Äô 1947 novel ‚ÄúThe Plague‚Äù a mysterious virus runs through the city of Oran. This has inspired comparisons with the COVID-19 pandemic in Algeria. 20 people were under intensive care in the hospital for COVID-19 in June 2020. Abdelaziz Djerad, the prime minister, visited to assess the evolution of case transmission and hospital conditions. The Algerian Minister of Health, Abderrahmane Benbouzid, toured the hospital. In 2003, the hospital played a critical role in the control of an outbreak of bubonic plague. It formed a crisis committee with the Institut Pasteur and the World Health Organisation and through molecular diagnosis, contact tracing and rapid treatment of cases identified, and treated 18 cases of plague with one fatality. In July 2020 the large increase in the number of cases of Covid 19 forced the hospital to turn the Physical Medicine and Occupational Rehabilitation centre into an area for Covid patients and the Department of Pediatric Urology was used for screening. 454 patients had been discharged from the hospital after recovery on 25th June since the start of the outbreak. Subsequently 300 symptomatic cases arrived in 24 hours. An RCB analysis device for the detection of Covid-19 was presented to the hospital in June 2020, a gift from Algerian doctors residing abroad. It can carry out about 16 analyzes per hour. An Algerian Ra√Ø singer, Siham El Gabouni, was arrested in July 2020 after releasing a video in which she criticised staffing levels at the Medical and Surgical Urgent Service and the dilapidated state of the hospital. She was charged by the management of the hospital center with contempt of an official institution, damage to the symbols of the national revolution, defamation and taking photos and recording without authorization. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined 3,000 Algerian dinars. A 46 year old man was later arrested for photographing medical kits in the Department of Chest Diseases in order to defame them.

She has written three travel health guides, two travel narratives, a novel and a series of wildlife adventures for children. She has also contributed to anthologies of travellers tales, has written innumerable articles for non- specialist readers, and many scientific/academic papers. Personal life Jane Wilson was born in Epsom Hospital, Surrey, as one of the three children of Peggy (Margaret) Thomas (1926‚Äì2015), from London, and a bibliophile, Joe Wilson (1920‚Äì2011), from Ballymena in Northern Ireland. She grew up in Stoneleigh, a suburb just north of Ewell Village. She is married to Simon Howarth and the couple currently live between East Anglia and Kathmandu. Education She attended Stoneleigh East County Infants, Junior and Senior Schools, and also Cheam High School, but was challenged by dyslexia. She left school at 16 to study for an Ordinary National Diploma in sciences at Ewell Technical College (now North East Surrey College of Technology). She then studied biological sciences at Plymouth Polytechnic, concentrating on invertebrates, pollution studies, environmental resource management, and completed a research project on cave microclimate and its influence on collembola. This involved countless trips into Radford Cave and led to her first publication. During cave exploration in the UK she made extensive collections of invertebrates to document the species living in lightless environments. In 1976 she was awarded a travelling scholarship by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, which funded a trip to Nepal. The Nepal connection led to a veterinary research job and she wrote a thesis about rabbit parasites for an MSc from Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Through this work she developed both an interest in immunology and a plan to work to help the poor in emerging nations. She then studied for a medical degree at the University of Southampton. She gained a Diploma in Child Health (Royal College of Physicians, London 1992), a Diploma in Community Child Health (Royal College of Physicians, RCGP and Public Health Faculty, Edinburgh 1992), a Diploma of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2007) and a fellowship in the Faculty of Travel Medicine, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 2009. She was also elected a fellow of the British Global and Travel Health Association in 2017. Medical career Since qualifying as a doctor of medicine, Wilson-Howarth has worked in general medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology in Swindon, orthopaedics in Salisbury and paediatrics at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She was employed on various child survival and hygiene promotion projects in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Indonesia, India and Nepal. Wilson-Howarth served as a National Health Service general practitioner (GP) in Cambridgeshire for over 15 years when she taught Cambridge medical students about general practice and also international health. She lectures on travel health too and has contributed to numerous textbooks, and on occasion to health stories for national newspapers. She helped provide clinical care to Syrian refugees in Greece for M√©decins du Monde / Doctors of the World in 2016. She works on occasion for Voluntary Service Overseas including in Nepal and also Nigeria. From early in 2015 until 2019, Wilson-Howarth was a trustee for Health Books International (see ) formerly Teaching-aids at Low Cost whose mission is to ship medical textbooks to low income countries. The work of HBI has now been taken on by the INGO Practical Action. Wilson-Howarth lived in Nepal from 1993 until 1998 and then moved back there in 2017 where she worked as a volunteer writing clinical guidelines for Nepali paramedics and mentoring clinicians in remote mountain villages through the charity PHASE (Practical Help Achieving Self Empowerment). She has also contributed material to the bilingual Covid19 Nepal Support website and she has an article about the infectivity of Covid-19 in the online Nepali newspaper Setopati Vital Load and Covid-19 Risk. Influences Dervla Murphy, Eric Newby, Hilary Bradt, Gerald Durrell, David Attenborough, Joe Wilson (her father). Sports and Expeditions Wilson-Howarth started caving and also scuba diving while an undergraduate in Plymouth pursuing ecological studies. She did some cave diving and was probably the first woman to do decompression dives in the subterranean \\"lake\\" in Pridhamsleigh Cavern in Devon. In 1973 she won the British Universities and Colleges individual canoe slalom event and on the same day also the seven-mile whitewater canoeing race. In addition she won the national colleges sailing championship. In 1978‚Äì79 she rowed for Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the first year the college had fielded a ladies eight, when they won three \\"bumps\\" in Eights Week. In 2004 she took the sport up again at Cambridge, rowing in various races on the River Cam and at Eton Dorney. Wilson-Howarth spent six months on an overland trip to the Himalayan region; this was with a small team intent on finding new caves in Pakistan, India and Nepal and documenting what lived inside them. She began some research on histoplasmosis, on bat rabies and made extensive zoological collections mostly for the British Museum (Natural History) / Natural History Museum, London. While an undergraduate at Southampton she was involved in further expeditions ‚Äì to Madagascar and (leading a team of eleven) Peru. She also organised a medical elective with Save the Children in Ladakh. In 1983 she was awarded the BISH Medal by the Scientific Exploration Society for \\"courage and determination in the face of adversity\\". The first Madagascar expedition led to a second, and this work contributed to the Ankarana Massif's recognition as an important refuge for mammals including the endangered crowned lemur, Sanford's brown lemur, as well as smaller wildlife and a previously unknown blind fish. The Massif also proved to be a rich location where important sub-fossil giant lemur remains were discovered. Writing Wilson-Howarth's writing almost invariably has a travel theme. Her first book (when she wrote as Jane Wilson), Lemurs of the Lost World (1990, 1995), is about expeditions to Madagascar and was described as the finest travel book thus far written about Madagascar by Dervla Murphy in the Times Literary Supplement.

For the komus≈ç (ËôöÁÑ°ÂÉß) monks of the Fuke sect, he was considered the traditional antecedent ‚Äî at least in spiritual, mythological, or philosophical terms ‚Äî of their order, which was formally established in Edo Japan. It is possible that the ideological roots of the sect derived from the Rinzai poet and iconoclast Ikky≈´ and the monk Shinchi Kakushin (ÂøÉÂú∞Ë¶∫ÂøÉ) who traveled to and from China and Japan in the 13th century. Still, according to some accounts, the sect is simply a more direct derivative of the Rinzai school and its teachings. The few records of Puhua's life and affairs are those accounted, if only briefly, in several East Asian religious or historical references. One of the only credible sources on his life is to be found in the Tang Dynasty Record of Linji, wherein he is portrayed as an obscure student and eventual dharma heir of Panshan Baoji, as well as a friend, colleague, student and/or contemporary of Linji Yixuan, who founded the Linji (Ëá®Ê∏àÂÆó Rinzai) sect in China. This implies that he may have been a real individual. The legends surrounding Puhua were more recently mentioned in the Monumenta Nipponica, R.H. Blyth's A History of Haiku (published in 1963) as well as some of the writings of Osho, along with later publications concerning the Fuke-sh≈´, the shakuhachi and related topics. In 1988 a shakuhachi learning and playing manual co-authored by the shakuhachi performer Christopher Yohmei Blasdel and the scholar Kamisango Y≈´k≈ç was published; the work is entitled The Shakuhachi: A Manual for Learning (), and thoroughly details the historicity of Fuke/Puhua and the precursors to Fuke Zen in China.  Life and legends  = Sources for the life of Puhua = There are two main sources for the life of Puhua: one is the aforementioned Linji lu or Record of Linji from China. The Linji lu is considered to contain a variety of historically accuratereference needed documents regarding Chinese Ch√°n, and is an important work on Zen Buddhism. Thus, if Puhua actually existed, his life may best be known by way of the Record of Linji. There is also Kyotaku Denki Kokuji Kai from Japan, which connects the legend of Fuke (Japanese version of the name Puhua) and the transmission and transformation of the Fuke sect in Japan, in particular with regard to the origin of the Komuso tradition and suizen (\\"blowing Zen\\"). While there is much disparity between the two texts, they do agree on at least one issue: In both the Record and Kyotaku Denki the notion of Puhua being an eccentric imbued with a sort of crazy wisdom, and perhaps even an iconoclast, is supported. Yet the texts again diverge on the issue of Fuke's influence on the Fuke sect of Japan: While the Kyotaku Denki directly attributes the founding of the school to him, the Fuke sect did not exist in China and as such he is never mentioned to be the leader of a separate religious tradition in the Linji lu. Although this is the case, the Record does provide certain subtleties regarding Puhua as being a person of his own, self-directed character who often did things ubiquitously and ignored social norms and doctrinal establishments. The following account of Puhua's life is an amalgamation of the accounts featured in both the Record and Kyotaku Denki, although it includes some outside references as well. = Historical accounts = Puhua is said to have been born in Tang Dynasty China in the year 770. It is not known where he was born, however his name, Zhenzhou, possibly references Zhengzhou, a city in the modern Henan province of north-central China. The Kyotaku Denki states that he lived in \\"Chen Province\\". Coincidentally, there is a village known as Chen by the Yellow River in Henan. Furthermore, one of Puhua's supposed students, Chang Po (Japanese: Ch≈çhaku; also stylized Cho Haku, Chohaku or Ch≈ç Haku and sometimes referred to as, simply, Haku) is said to have lived in Henan (also transliterated as Ho Nan). One account states that Puhua lived in and traveled through an area known as \\"Toh\\" in China. In the Record of Linji Puhua is noted as being a student and dharma heir of Panshan Baoji (who by some accounts is either the same person as, or different from, another Ch√°n patriarch by the name of Baizhang Huaihai) alongside two other dharma heirs: Huangbo and Linji. Puhua's own group of students reportedly included several individuals whose historicity is also dubious: \\"Ennin\\", \\"Chang Po\\" (Ch≈çhaku) and \\"Zhang Bai\\" (whose name is also stylized as Zhang Bo). (At least one, if not all of these individuals is implied to have been Puhua's heir and purportedly passed on his legacy to many more disciples and eventually the komus≈ç.) Puhua is said to have been not only a contemporary of Linji/Rinzai, but also one of his students. Thus Puhua is sometimes included in the fold of the Linji z≈çng (Japanese: Rinzai-sh≈´) in certain chronicles, as well as Huineng's \\"Sudden Enlightenment\\" school because it is, in some respects, an antecedent for the Rinzai school to begin with, and especially influenced Linji's epoynmous sect in the Tang Dynasty, where and when Puhua and Linji lived. (Not surprisingly, the Japanese Fuke sect of the Edo period considered itself a delineation of the Rinzai sect.) Fuke was reputedly a multi-talented monk and priest, known for being inventive, intelligent and at the same time quite strict. He is characterized by all accounts to have been a spontaneous individual who demonstrated a unique style of non-verbal communication that is an important aspect of Zen Buddhist philosophy and historically the staple teaching method of the Zen Patriarchs and even Bodhidharma (an Indian monk and the ostensible founder of Zen Buddhism) himself. The Kyotaku Denki reinforces this characteristic, stating that Puhua \\"was pleased with his uninhibited Zen spirit.\\" This kind of capriciousness can be gleaned from a legend regarding Puhua wherein he is attending the deathbed of his master Panshan: > When Panshan Baoji was near death, he said to the monks, \\"Is there anyone > among you who can draw my likeness?\\" Many of the monks made drawings for > Panshan, but none were to his liking. The monk Puhua stepped forward and > said, \\"I can draw it.\\" Panshan said, \\"Why don't you show it to me?\\" Puhua > then turned a somersault and went out. Panshan said, \\"Someday, that fellow > will teach others in a crazy manner!\\" Having said these words, Panshan > passed away. Many stories about Puhua that appear in the Record of Linji add to his reputation of having a rough and uncompromising manner of expressing the dharma. For example:Schloegl, pp. 66‚Äì67 > 44.a. One day the master (Linji Yixuan) and Puhua went to a vegetarian > banquet given them by a believer. During it, the master asked Puhua: \\"'A > hair swallows the vast ocean, a mustard seed contains Mt. Sumeru' ‚Äì does > this happen by means of supernatural powers, or is the whole body > (substance, essence) like this?\\" Puhua kicked over the table. The master > said: \\"Rough fellow.\\" Puhua retorted: \\"What place is this here to speak of > rough and refined?\\" b. The next day, they went again to a vegetarian > banquet. During it, the master asked: \\"Today's fare, how does it compare > with yesterday's?\\" Puhua (as before) kicked over the table. The master said: > \\"Understand it you do ‚Äì but still, you are a rough fellow.\\" Puhua replied: > \\"Blind fellow, does one preach of any roughness or finesse in the Buddha- > Dharma?\\" The master stuck out his tongue. There is some controversy as to the degree and nature of Fuke's musical talents, but his later \\"followers\\" (the monks of the Fuke sect in Japan) would often reflect on a certain story that appears in the Kyotaku Denki for inspiration. A 16th century Japanese depiction of Puhua (Fuke) by Seta Kamon, with commentary. The story tells of Puhua going through his hometown, ringing a bell and reciting a gatha to summon others to enlightenment. The same, for many Fuke practitioners, applied to the shakuhachi through suizen (Japanese: ÂêπÁ¶Ö)‚Äî\\"blowing meditation\\" traditionally practiced by the komus≈ç involving the use of the shakuhachi as a spiritual/religious instrument for meditation and as a way to attain bodhi‚Äîand its mastery was seen as a path to enlightenment: > Ringing a taku , he would go to town and say to passersby: \\"My≈çt≈çrai > my≈çt≈çda, ant≈çrai ant≈çda, Shih≈ç hachimenrai (ya), senp≈´da, Kok≈´ra[i] (ya), > rengada. [This roughly translates to,] \\"If attacked in the light, I will > strike back in the light. If attacked in the dark, I will strike in the > dark. If attacked from all quarters, I will strike as a whirlwind does. If > attacked from the empty sky, I will thrash with a flail.\\" One day, a man > named Ch≈ç Haku of Ho Nan province heard these words and revered the priest > Fuke for his great virtue. He appealed to the priest for permission to > follow him, but the priest did not accept him. Haku had previously had a > taste for playing pipes. Having listened to the sound of the Priest's bell, > he at once made a [bamboo] flute and imitated the sound. [Thereafter] he > played the sound untiringly on the flute and never played other pieces Since > he made the sound of the bell on his flute, he named the flute kyotaku... (The term kyotaku means \\"empty bell\\" in Japanese. \\"Empty bell\\" can also be translated as Kyorei, which happens to be the name of one of the san koten honkyoku (Japanese: \\"three classic original pieces\\"; also known as the Bekkaku), honkyoku (Japanese: Êú¨Êõ≤, \\"original pieces\\") being the traditional musical pieces for shakuhachi played by the mendicant monks of the Fuke sect for alms and enlightenment since as early as the 13th century, long before the Fuke sect was actually formally established.) Fuke's gatha is sometimes called \\"Shidanoge\\". Another version of the story portrays Ch≈ç Haku attempting to become the student of Zhang Bai instead of Puhua directly, as in this version Zhang Bai is depicted as a student who garnered favor from Puhua and so had become admired by Ch≈ç Haku. It was believed by the historical komus≈ç that the tradition that led to suizen was handed down by Ch≈ç Haku through his family and eventually reached its way to Japan by way of the monk Kakushin, to the komus≈ç and later the founder of Myoanji‚Äîat one time the head temple of the Fuke-sh≈´ in Kyoto and still a place of profound importance for many shakuhachi, Fuke Zen and Rinzai Zen enthusiasts the world over‚ÄîKyochiku Zenji (also known as Kichiku).  Death  Fuke's death is related as follows: > \\"One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a > robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master > [Linji] made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: > \\"There, I had this robe made for you.\\" Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went > back to the street market, calling loudly: \\"Rinzai had this robe made for > me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation\\" (to die).\\" The people > of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: \\"No, not today. > Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation.\\" And so for > three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now > without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid > himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the > lid. The news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On > opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up > in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell.\\" = Legacy = Hisamatsu Fuyo, a 19th-century Zen Buddhist hermit and shakuhachi dai-shihan (grandmaster) was once interviewed regarding Fuke: > Q. \\"What kind of person was Fuke Zenji?\\" A. \\"I do not know. Better ask > someone with more knowledge of Zen.\\" Q. \\"Wasn't Fuke the ancestor of > shakuhachi? If one follows this path but doesn't know its origins, is that > not a sign of immaturity?\\" A. \\"As for myself, because I understand the > source of shakuhachi, I say I do not know Fuke. Fuke was an enlightened man, > but I do not think he sought his enlightenment by playing shakuhachi. He > cannot be compared to an ignorant blind person like me who plays shakuhachi > because he enjoys it and has gradually come to know that shakuhachi is a Zen > instrument. Even if Fuke had played shakuhachi, it would only have been a > passing fancy. His practice of shakuhachi would not compare to my training > for many years. If Fuke were to come alive again in this generation he would > surely become my disciple and ask me to show him the way. If you look at > records from the time of Fuke, and if you know all about his life, but you > do not know his enlightenment, then you do not know Fuke. On the other hand, > a person who knows nothing of his life, but knows his enlightenment, he > knows Fuke. I do not know him yet.\\"  See also  * Buddhism in China * Buddhism in Japan * Fuke Zen ** Komus≈ç ** Suizen *** Shakuhachi **** Hocchiku *** Honkyoku * Ikky≈´ * List of Rinzai Buddhists * Panshan Baoji  References  Category:770 births Category:9th- century deaths Category:Rinzai Buddhists Category:Tang dynasty Buddhist monks Category:Chan Buddhist monks Category:Zen Patriarchs Category:Fuke Zen ","title":"Puhua"},{"id":"30624240","text":"Temnora swynnertoni is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

Programs Israelis are drafted at 18 years old, generally after graduation from high school. In many fields, the army needs soldiers with a much broader education and academic background, such as engineers, physicians, economists and lawyers. The Atuda program was created for this purpose.

After finishing his or her studies, the Atudai serves two years and eight months of obligatory service in the army, like any other male soldier, or two years, like any other female soldier, and then serves an additional three years of regular service. The difference between obligatory service and regular service is, among other things, reflected in the salary they earn.

Loberg died on February 28, 2004 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Career Loberg first joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1941. After being commissioned an officer, he was assigned to the 26th Bombardment Squadron based at Hickam Field where he survived the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. During World War II he would pilot the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. On October 23, 1942, Loberg engaged in a 45-minute-long dogfight against a Japanese Kawanishi H6K that was attacking a U.S. Navy patrol boat. As it is highly unusual for a bomber to engage in such action, the event garnered much attention and was featured in a book written by Ira Wolfert and was the subject of a painting entitled \\"An Interesting Dog Fight\\" by artist Stan Stokes. On June 15, 1944, Lt. Col. Loberg piloted the first plane over Yawata, Japan, flying \\"Pathfinder\\" for the entire mission. This mission was the first land-based plane bombing of the homeland of the Japanese Empire, and the first raid since the Doolittle Raid in April 1944. During the Korean War Loberg served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the War Planning Room of Strategic Air Command.
