His real name is John Burstein, and he is the self-styled 'black sheep' of his achievement‚Äêoriented family of six children from Lawrence, L.I.\\" While working at The Floating Hospital in New York City he began writing songs and skits to entertain the children there and to teach them about anatomy and the workings of the human body. He eventually added an organ-painted body suit to the design, dubbing his alter- ego \\"Slim Goodbody\\". Burstein lives with his wife, Chrissy, in a lakeside home in Lincolnville, Maine. They have two sons, Devin and Luke. Burstein's sister Karen Burstein was a New York State Senator and Judge. Career Burstein soon took his character outside the hospital. In his earliest days, he mainly did personal appearances and guest spots on shows such as The Today Show and Good Morning America. His skits also focused on exercise, personal hygiene, and nutrition. Between 1976 and 1981 he appeared twice a week on the CBS show Captain Kangaroo. Slim Goodbody eventually received his own television series in 1980, Inside Story on PBS. The program mainly consisted of Burstein's live- show Slim Goodbody sketches, though other children's show celebrities such as Captain Kangaroo would sometimes make guest appearances. The show soon became the station's second-highest rated program, and Burstein landed roles on other stations, including Nickelodeon. 1984-1985 American Osteopathic Association. Since then, Slim Goodbody has featured in several other series, as well. At one point Slim Goodbody began making educational shorts on such subjects as the fear of visiting a hospital, amongst others. One of these shorts featured Burstein's son, Devin, as a child learning about hospitals as he overcomes his fears of an upcoming operation. Beginning in 1982, the character has also appeared in books published by McGraw-Hill, Putnam, and Fairview Press. A series of educational shorts featuring Burstein's character were produced in 1985. Titled, Well, Well, Well! with Slim Goodbody, these were aimed for school children grades K-4. In 2014, Slim Goodbody appeared in a Radio Shack commercial advertisement during the Super Bowl XLVIII.

He founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987 and ran it until 1994, when he resigned from the company. McAfee Associates achieved early success as the creator of McAfee's first commercial antivirus software, and the business now produces a range of enterprise security software. The company was purchased by Intel in 2011 and spun back out in 2017 with TPG Capital owning a majority stake, though the software has always borne the McAfee brand name. McAfee's wealth peaked in 2007 at $100 million, before his investments plummeted in the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Since leaving McAfee Associates, he has founded the companies Tribal Voice (makers of the PowWow chat program), QuorumEx and Future Tense Central, among others, and has been involved in leadership positions in the companies Everykey, MGT Capital Investments and Luxcore, among others. His personal and business interests include smartphone apps, cryptocurrency, yoga, and herbal antibiotics. He resided for a number of years in Belize, but returned to the United States in 2013. McAfee is also a political activist. He unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for President of the United States in 2016 and 2020. On October 6, 2020 McAfee was arrested in Spain over tax evasion charges. The charges were announced shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had brought civil charges against McAfee and that he could face 30 years in prison if convicted. Early life McAfee was born in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom on a U.S. Army base to an American father, who was stationed there, and a British mother. He was raised in Salem, Virginia, US. McAfee has said he feels as much British as he is American. When McAfee was 15, his father, an abusive alcoholic, committed suicide by gunshot. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1967 from Roanoke College, which subsequently awarded him an honorary Sc.D. degree in 2008.  Ventures  = Before McAfee Associates = McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970. From there, he went to Univac as a software designer, and later to Xerox as an operating system architect. In 1978, he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant. He worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton from 1980‚Äì1982. In the 1980s, while employed by Lockheed, McAfee received a copy of the Brain computer virus, and began developing software to combat viruses. = McAfee Associates = In 1987 McAfee founded McAfee Associates, a computer anti-virus company. The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1992, and McAfee resigned from the company in 1994. Two years after McAfee Associates went public, McAfee sold his remaining stake in the company. Network Associates was formed in 1997 as a merger of McAfee Associates and Network General. The Network Associates company name was retained for seven years, when it was renamed McAfee, Inc. In August 2010, Intel bought McAfee, maintaining the separate branding, until January 2014, when it announced that McAfee-related products will be marketed as Intel Security. McAfee expressed his pleasure at the name change, saying, \\"I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet.\\" The unit was spun out of Intel in April 2017 as McAfee, LLC, as a joint venture between TPG Capital and Intel. = After McAfee Associates = Other business ventures that were founded by McAfee include Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs, PowWow. In 2000, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Zone Labs, makers of firewall software, prior to its acquisition by Check Point Software in 2003. In August 2009, The New York Times reported that McAfee's personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million, the effect of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 on his investments. In 2009, McAfee was interviewed in Belize for the CNBC special \\"The Bubble Decade,\\" in which it was reported that he had invested in and/or built many mansions in the USA that went unsold when the 2007 global recession hit. The report also discussed his quest to produce plants for possible medicinal uses on his land in Belize. In February 2010, McAfee started the company QuorumEx, headquartered in Belize, which aimed to produce herbal antibiotics that disrupt quorum sensing in bacteria. In June 2013, McAfee uploaded a parody video titled How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus onto his YouTube channel. In the video, McAfee criticized McAfee's antivirus software while snorting white powder, and being stroked and undressed by scantily clad women. The video has garnered over 9 million views. McAfee told Reuters that he made the video to ridicule the media's negative coverage of him. A spokesman for McAfee Inc. called the video's statements \\"ludicrous.\\" Also in 2013, McAfee started the company Future Tense Central, which aimed to produce a secure computer network device called the D-Central. By 2016, it was also serving as an incubator. In February 2014, McAfee announced Cognizant, an application for smartphones, which displays information about the permissions of other installed applications. In April 2014, Cognizant was renamed DCentral 1, and an Android version of it was released for free on Google Play. At the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas, Nevada in August 2014, he warned Americans not to use smartphones, suggesting apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who do not read privacy user agreements.Danny Yadron, John McAfee at Def Con: Don't Use Smartphones , The Wall Street Journal, August 8, 2014 In January 2016, he became the chief evangelist for security startup Everykey. In February 2016, McAfee received media attention by publicly volunteering to decrypt the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooters, avoiding the need for Apple to build a backdoor. McAfee later admitted that his claims of how simple cracking the phone would be were a publicity stunt, though he still claimed he could pull it off. In May 2016, McAfee was appointed chief executive chairman and CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a technology holding company. The company initially stated that it would rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies, although this plan was abandoned due to a dispute with Intel over rights to the \\"McAfee\\" name.About MGT McAfee changed MGT's focus from social gaming to cybersecurity, stating in an interview that \\"anti-virus software is dead, it no longer works,\\" and that \\"the new paradigm has to stop the hacker getting in\\" before they can do damage. Soon after joining MGT, McAfee claimed that he and his team had exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from WhatsApp. Gizmodo investigated these claims, and reported that McAfee had sent reporters malware-infected phones to make this hack work. McAfee responded to these accusations, writing: \\"Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.\\" McAfee also moved MGT into the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying that it was intended both to make money for the company, and to increase MGT's expertise in dealing with blockchains, which he thought was important for cybersecurity. In August 2017, McAfee stepped down as CEO, instead serving as MGT's \\"chief cybersecurity visionary.\\" In January 2018, he left the company altogether. Both sides stated that the decision was amicable, with McAfee saying that he wanted to spend all of his time on cryptocurrencies, while the company stated that they were getting pressured by potential investors to disassociate themselves from McAfee. On August 13, 2018, McAfee took a position of CEO with Luxcore, a cryptocurrency company focused on enterprise solutions. Politics =Political positions= McAfee identifies as a libertarian, advocating the decriminalization of cannabis, an end to the war on drugs, non-interventionism in foreign policy, a free market economy which does not redistribute wealth, and upholding free trade. McAfee supports abolishing the Transportation Security Administration. McAfee advocates increased cyber awareness, and more action against the threat of cyberwarfare. McAfee advocates religious liberty, saying that business owners should be able to deny service in circumstances that contradict their religious beliefs, and: \\"No one is forcing you to buy anything or to choose one person over another. So why should I be forced to do anything if I am not harming you? It's my choice to sell, your choice to buy.\\" =2016 presidential campaign= On September 8, 2015, McAfee announced that he would seek the office of President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, as the candidate of a newly formed political party called the Cyber Party. On December 24, 2015, he re-announced his candidacy bid saying that he would instead seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. On the campaign trail, McAfee consistently polled among the top three presidential candidates for his party with his rivals Gary Johnson and Austin Petersen. The three candidates appeared in the Libertarian Party's first nationally televised presidential debate on March 29, 2016. McAfee announced that his vice presidential choice would be the photographer, former commercial real estate broker, and Libertarian activist Judd Weiss. McAfee was the runner-up in the primaries but came in third at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention. Notable endorsements * Adam Kokesh, talk show host and activist * John Moore, Nevada assemblyman * L. Neil Smith, science fiction author and activist =2020 presidential campaign= McAfee announced his second bid for president in June 2018, for the 2020 presidential election. His main campaign issue is to promote the use of cryptocurrencies. He stated that he will either again seek the nomination of the Libertarian Party, or form his own party; he ultimately ran as a Libertarian. In a tweet, on March 4, 2020, McAfee simultaneously suspended his 2020 presidential campaign and announced his campaign for the Libertarian party vice presidential nomination. The next day, he returned to the presidential field, reserving the suspension of his bid, as \\"No one in the Libertarian Party Would [sic] consider me For Vice President.\\" The next month, he endorsed Adam Kokesh; he simultaneously became Kokesh's vice-presidential candidate. McAfee was again not nominated, losing to Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen for the vice-presidential slot. Other views McAfee has contended that taxes are illegal and has claimed in 2019 that he had not filed a tax return since 2010. He refers to himself as being a \\"prime target\\" of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.Louis Casiano, \\"John McAfee calls taxes 'illegal,' says it's been 8 years since he filed a return\\", Fox News, Jan. 4, 2019, at . In July 2017, McAfee wrote on Twitter that he predicted that the price of one bitcoin would jump to $500,000 within three years, and \\"If not, I will eat my own dick on national television.\\" In November 2017, he increased his prediction to $1 million. In January 2020, however, he stated on Twitter that his previous predictions were simply \\"A ruse to onboard new users\\", and that bitcoin had limited potential because it was \\"an ancient technology\\". Asked which cryptocurrencies he now recommended, he listed Monero and Pirate Chain. On June 24, 2019, McAfee, who was then living in Cuba, tweeted a defense of Che Guevara, saying that \\"If You (sic) call Che Guevara a terrorist you show your ignorance and your acceptance of the U.S. government's propaganda and lies.\\" On August 13, 2020, McAfee tweeted that \\"Despite my efforts (licking handles of grocery carts, bottom of my shoes, etc.) I'm unable to get Coronavirus to challenge me.\\" The tweet featured photos of test devices alleged showing negative viral test results and of McAfee licking the bottom of an athletic shoe. Personal life The night after McAfee arrived in the United States after being deported from Guatemala in December 2012, he was solicited by Janice Dyson, then a prostitute in South Beach (Miami Beach). The two spent the night together. Despite Dyson being more than 30 years McAfee‚Äôs junior, McAfee and Dyson subsequently began a relationship, and married in 2013. McAfee originally took up residence in Portland, Oregon in 2013. In a 2012 article in Mensa Bulletin, the magazine of American Mensa, McAfee stated that being the developer of the first commercial anti-virus program has made him \\"the most popular hacking target,\\" confiding: \\"Hackers see hacking me as a badge of honor.\\" He added that for his own security, he has other people buy his computer equipment for him, uses pseudonyms for setting up computers and logging in, and changes his IP address several times a day. When asked on another occasion if he personally uses McAfee's antivirus software, McAfee replied: \\"I take it off,\\" and, \\"It's too annoying.\\" McAfee claims that the former cocaine baron \\"Boston\\" George Jung is writing his official biography, No Domain. Since December 2018, McAfee has stated several times on Twitter that he has 47 biological children. On February 8, 2020, McAfee claimed to reside in Lexington, Tennessee. Legal issues On April 30, 2012, McAfee's property in Orange Walk Town, Belize, was raided by the Gang Suppression Unit of the Belize Police Department. At that time, McAfee was in bed with a girlfriend. A GSU press release stated that McAfee was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon. He was released without charge. In 2012, Belize police spokesman, Raphael Martinez, confirmed that McAfee was neither convicted nor charged, only suspected. In January 2014, McAfee claimed that when the Belizean government raided his property, it seized his assets, and that his house later burned down under suspicious circumstances. On November 12, 2012, Belize police started a search for McAfee as a \\"person of interest\\" in connection to the murder of American expatriate Gregory Viant Faull. Faull was found dead of a gunshot wound on November 11, 2012, at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize. Faull was a neighbor of McAfee's. In a November 2012 interview with Wired, McAfee said that he has always been afraid police would kill him, and thus refused their routine questions; he has since evaded the Belizean authorities. Belize's prime minister, Dean Barrow, called McAfee \\"extremely paranoid, even bonkers.\\" McAfee fled Belize when he was sought for questioning concerning the murder. The magazine Vice accidentally gave away McAfee's location at a Guatemalan resort in early December 2012, when a photo taken by one of its journalists accompanying McAfee was posted with the EXIF geolocation metadata still attached. While in Guatemala, McAfee asked Chad Essley, an American cartoonist and animator, to set up a blog so that McAfee could write about his experience while on the run. McAfee then appeared publicly in Guatemala City, where he attempted to seek political asylum. On December 5, 2012, McAfee was arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. Shortly afterward, he was placed under arrest, and a board to review McAfee's plea for asylum was formed. The committee denied his asylum, so he was taken from his holding facility to a detention center in order to await deportation to Belize. On December 6, 2012, Reuters and ABC News reported that McAfee had two minor heart attacks in a Guatemalan detention center and was hospitalized. McAfee's lawyer stated that his client had not suffered heart attacks, but had instead suffered from high blood pressure and anxiety attacks. McAfee later said he had faked the heart attacks while being held in Guatemala, to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, thus hastening the government's decision to send him back to the United States. On December 12, 2012, McAfee was released from detention in Guatemala, and deported to the United States. On August 2, 2015, McAfee was arrested in Henderson County, Tennessee, on charges of: one count of driving under the influence, and one count of possession of a firearm while intoxicated. On November 14, 2018, the Circuit Court in Orlando, Florida refused to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit against McAfee for Faull's death. In January 2019, McAfee announced that he was on the run from U.S. authorities, and living internationally on a boat following the convening of a Grand Jury to indict him, his wife, and four of his 2020 Presidential campaign workers on tax- related charges. The IRS has not independently confirmed the existence of these charges. In July 2019, McAfee and members of his entourage were arrested while his yacht was docked at Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, on suspicion of carrying high-caliber weapons and ammunition. They were held for four days before being released. On August 11, 2020, McAfee fabricated a hoax that he was arrested in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic, after refusing to replace a lace thong with a more effective face mask. McAfee would later post a picture of himself to Twitter with a black eye, claiming that it occurred during this arrest. However, the photo of the alleged arrest shows an officer with the German word for \\"police\\" on their uniform, so it could not have been an arrest in Norway. The Augsburg Police later confirmed McAfee unsuccessfully attempted to enter Germany on that day, but was not arrested. On October 5, 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice for tax evasion. The indictment alleges he earned millions of dollars from 2014‚Äì18, but has failed to file income tax returns. On October 6, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging that McAfee had fraudulently promoted certain ICOs. According to the SEC, McAfee presented himself as an impartial investor when he promoted the ICOs, despite the fact that he was allegedly paid $23 million in digital assets in exchange for the promotions. In the media Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee is a Showtime Networks documentary about the portion of McAfee's life spent in Belize. It began airing in September 2016. The documentary covers allegations of both the rape of McAfee's former business partner, Allison Adonizio, and the murders of Belizean David Middleton and American expat Gregory Faull. In an interview with Bloomberg's Pimm Fox and Kathleen Hayes on September 8, 2016, McAfee claimed that these incidents were fabricated, saying that \\"Belize is a third-world banana republic and you can go down there and make any story you want if you pay your interviewees, which Showtime did.\\" In March 2017, it was reported that Glenn Ficarra and John Requa would direct a film about McAfee titled King of the Jungle, with a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. At various points, Johnny Depp, Michael Keaton, and Seth Rogen were reported to have been signed to roles in the film and later to have left the project. In November 2019, Zac Efron was reported to be starring in the film. On May 12, 2017, McAfee was interviewed on ABC's 20/20 regarding the alleged murder of his neighbor, Greg Faull. McAfee's wife, Janice, was interviewed in the segment as well.

The light is invisible to the human eye, but creates a day-like environment for the surveillance cameras. A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. Researchers are currently developing multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work. The most advanced face recognition method, which is also employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image. While initially a form of computer application, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human's physiological characteristics facial recognition systems are categorised as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless and non-invasive process. Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human-computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of images.  History of facial recognition technology  Automated facial recognition was pioneered in the 1960s. Woody Bledsoe, Helen Chan Wolf, and Charles Bisson worked on using the computer to recognize human faces. Their early facial recognition project was dubbed \\"man-machine\\" because the coordinates of the facial features in a photograph had to be established by a human before they could be used by the computer for recognition. On a graphics tablet a human had to pinpoint the coordinates of facial features such as the pupil centers, the inside and outside corner of eyes, and the widows peak in the hairline. The coordinates were used to calculate 20 distances, including the width of the mouth and of the eyes. A human could process about 40 pictures an hour in this manner and so build a database of the computed distances. A computer would then automatically compare the distances for each photograph, calculate the difference between the distances and return the closed records as a possible match. In 1970 Takeo Kanade publicly demonstrated a face matching system that located anatomical features such as the chin and calculated the distance ratio between facial features without human intervention. Later tests revealed that the system could not always reliably identify facial features. But interest in the subject grew and in 1977 Kanade published the first detailed book on facial recognition technology. In 1993 the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) established the face recognition technology program FERET to develop \\"automatic face recognition capabilities\\" that could be employed in a productive real life environment \\"to assist security, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel in the performance of their duties\\". Face recognition systems that had been trialed in research labs were evaluated and the FERET tests found that while the performance of existing automated facial recognition systems varied, a handful of existing methods could viably be used to recognize faces in still images taken in a controlled environment. The FERET tests spawned three US companies that sold automated facial recognition systems. Vision Corporation and Miros Inc were both founded in 1994 by researchers who used the results of the FERET tests as selling point. Viisage Technology was established by a identification card defense contractor in 1996 to commercially exploit the rights to the facial recognition algorithm developed by Alex Pentland at MIT. Following the 1993 FERET face recognition vendor test the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices in West Virginia and New Mexico were the first DMV offices to use automated facial recognition systems so as to prevent and detect people obtaining multiple driving licenses under different names. Driver's licenses in the United States were at that point a commonly accepted from of photo identification. DMV offices across the United States were undergoing a technological upgrade and were in the process of establishing databases of digital ID photographs. This enabled DMV offices to deploy the facial recognition systems on the market to search photographs for new driving licenses against the existing DMV database. DMV offices became one of the first major markets for automated facial recognition technology and introduced US citizens to facial recognition as a standard method of identification. The increase of the US prison population in the 1990s promted U.S. states to established connected and automated identification systems that incorporated digital biometric databases, in some instances this included facial recognition. In 1999 Minnesota incorporated the facial recognition system FaceIT by Visionics into a mug shot booking system that allowed police, judges and court officers to track criminals across the state.

The Viola‚ÄìJones algorithm for face detection uses Haar- like features to locate faces in an image. Here a Haar Feature that looks similar to the bridge of the nose is applied onto the face. Until the 1990s facial recognition systems were developed primarily by using photographic portraits of human faces. Research on face recognition to reliably locate a face in an image that contains other objects gained traction in the early 1990s with the principle component analysis (PCA). The PCA method of face detection is also known as Eigenface and was developed by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland. Turk and Pentland combined the conceptual approach of the Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve theorem and factor analysis, to develop a linear model. Eigenfaces are determined based on global and orthogonal features in human faces. These features are established in an unsupervised machine learning process with the help of the Gaussian blur. A human face is calculated as a weighted combination of a number of Eigenfaces. Because few Eigenfaces were used to encode human faces of a given population, Turk and Pentland's PCA face detection method greatly reduced the amount of data that had to be processed to detect a face. Pentland in 1994 defined Eigenface features, including eigen eyes, eigen mouths and eigen noses, to advance the use of PCA in facial recognition. In 1997 the PCA Eigenface method of face recognition was improved upon in a supervised machine learning process using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to produce Fisherfaces. LDA Fisherfaces became dominantly used in PCA feature based face recognition. While Eigenfaces were in combination with genetic algorithm, neural networks and statistical learning theory also used for face reconstruction. In these approaches no global structure of the face is calculated which links the facial features or parts. Purely feature based approaches to facial recognition were overtaken in the late 1990s by the Bochum system, which used Gabor filter to record the face features and computed a grid of the face structure to link the features. Christoph von der Malsburg and his research team at the University of Bochum developed Elastic Bunch Graph Matching in the mid 1990s to extract a face out of an image using skin segmentation. By 1997 the face detection method developed by Malsburg outperformed most other facial detection systems on the market. The so called \\"Bochum system\\" of face detection was sold commercially on the market as ZN- Face to operators of airports and other busy locations. The software was \\"robust enough to make identifications from less-than-perfect face views. It can also often see through such impediments to identification as mustaches, beards, changed hairstyles and glasses‚Äîeven sunglasses\\". Real-time face detection in video footage became possible in 2001 with the Viola‚ÄìJones object detection framework for faces. Paul Viola and Michael Jones combined their face detection method with the Haar-like feature approach to object recognition in digital images to launch AdaBoost, the first real-time frontal- view face detector. By 2015 the Viola-Jones algorithm had been implemented using small low power detectors on handheld devices and embedded systems. Therefore the Viola-Jones algorithm has not only broadened the practical application of face recognition systems but has also been used to support new features in user interfaces and teleconferencing. Techniques for face recognition Automatic face detection with OpenCV. While humans can recognize faces without much effort, facial recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem in computing. Facial recognition systems attempt to identify a human face, which is three-dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression, based on its two-dimensional image. To accomplish this computational task, facial recognition systems perform four steps. First face detection is used to segment the face from the image background. In the second step the segmented face image is aligned to account for face pose, image size and photographic properties, such as illumination and grayscale. The purpose of the alignment process is to enable the accurate localization of facial features in the third step, the facial feature extraction. Features such as eyes, nose and mouth are pinpointed and measured in the image to represent the face. The so established feature vector of the face is then, in the fourth step, matched against a database of faces. =Traditional= Some face recognition algorithms identify facial features by extracting landmarks, or features, from an image of the subject's face. For example, an algorithm may analyze the relative position, size, and/or shape of the eyes, nose, cheekbones, and jaw. These features are then used to search for other images with matching features. Other algorithms normalize a gallery of face images and then compress the face data, only saving the data in the image that is useful for face recognition. A probe image is then compared with the face data. One of the earliest successful systemsR. Brunelli and T. Poggio, \\"Face Recognition: Features versus Templates\\", IEEE Trans. on PAMI, 1993, (15)10:1042-1052 is based on template matching techniquesR. Brunelli, Template Matching Techniques in Computer Vision: Theory and Practice, Wiley, , 2009 ( TM book) applied to a set of salient facial features, providing a sort of compressed face representation. Recognition algorithms can be divided into two main approaches: geometric, which looks at distinguishing features, or photo-metric, which is a statistical approach that distills an image into values and compares the values with templates to eliminate variances. Some classify these algorithms into two broad categories: holistic and feature- based models. The former attempts to recognize the face in its entirety while the feature-based subdivide into components such as according to features and analyze each as well as its spatial location with respect to other features. Popular recognition algorithms include principal component analysis using eigenfaces, linear discriminant analysis, elastic bunch graph matching using the Fisherface algorithm, the hidden Markov model, the multilinear subspace learning using tensor representation, and the neuronal motivated dynamic link matching. = Human identification at a distance (HID) = Eigenfaces of face images. Eigentransformation is a face hallucination method. To enable human identification at a distance (HID) low-resolution images of faces are enhanced using face hallucination. In CCTV imagery faces are often very small. But because facial recognition algorithms that identify and plot facial features require high resolution images, resolution enhancement techniques have been developed to enable facial recognition systems to work with imagery that has been captured in environments with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Face hallucination algorithms that are applied to images prior to those images being submitted to the facial recognition system utilise example-based machine learning with pixel substitution or nearest neighbour distribution indexes that may also incorporate demographic and age related facial characteristics. Use of face hallucination techniques improves the performance of high resolution facial recognition algorithms and may be used to overcome the inherent limitations of super-resolution algorithms. Face hallucination techniques are also used to pre-treat imagery where faces are disguised. Here the disguise, such as sunglasses, is removed and the face hallucination algorithm is applied to the image. Such face hallucination algorithms need to be trained on similar face images with and without disguise. To fill in the area uncovered by removing the disguise, face hallucination algorithms need to correctly map the entire state of the face, which may be not possible due to the momentary facial expression captured in the low resolution image. = 3-Dimensional recognition = 3D model of a human face. Three-dimensional face recognition technique uses 3D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face. This information is then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of a face, such as the contour of the eye sockets, nose, and chin. One advantage of 3D face recognition is that it is not affected by changes in lighting like other techniques. It can also identify a face from a range of viewing angles, including a profile view. Three-dimensional data points from a face vastly improve the precision of face recognition. 3D-dimensional face recognition research is enabled by the development of sophisticated sensors that project structured light onto the face. 3D matching technique are sensitive to expressions, therefore researchers at Technion applied tools from metric geometry to treat expressions as isometries. A new method of capturing 3D images of faces uses three tracking cameras that point at different angles; one camera will be pointing at the front of the subject, second one to the side, and third one at an angle. All these cameras will work together so it can track a subject's face in real-time and be able to face detect and recognize. = Thermal cameras = pseudocolor image of two people taken in long-wavelength infrared (body-temperature thermal) light. A different form of taking input data for face recognition is by using thermal cameras, by this procedure the cameras will only detect the shape of the head and it will ignore the subject accessories such as glasses, hats, or makeup. Unlike conventional cameras, thermal cameras can capture facial imagery even in low- light and nighttime conditions without using a flash and exposing the position of the camera. However, the databases for face recognition are limited. Efforts to build databases of thermal face images date back to 2004. By 2016 several databases existed, including the IIITD-PSE and the Notre Dame thermal face database. Current thermal face recognition systems are not able to reliably detect a face in a thermal image that has been taken of an outdoor environment. In 2018, researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed a technique that would allow them to match facial imagery obtained using a thermal camera with those in databases that were captured using a conventional camera. Known as a cross-spectrum synthesis method due to how it bridges facial recognition from two different imaging modalities, this method synthesize a single image by analyzing multiple facial regions and details. It consists of a non-linear regression model that maps a specific thermal image into a corresponding visible facial image and an optimization issue that projects the latent projection back into the image space. ARL scientists have noted that the approach works by combining global information (i.e. features across the entire face) with local information (i.e. features regarding the eyes, nose, and mouth). According to performance tests conducted at ARL, the multi-region cross-spectrum synthesis model demonstrated a performance improvement of about 30% over baseline methods and about 5% over state-of-the- art methods.  Application  = Social media = Founded in 2013, Looksery went on to raise money for its face modification app on Kickstarter. After successful crowdfunding, Looksery launched in October 2014. The application allows video chat with others through a special filter for faces that modifies the look of users. Image augmenting applications already on the market, such as FaceTune and Perfect365, were limited to static images, whereas Looksery allowed augmented reality to live videos. In late 2015 SnapChat purchased Looksery, which would then become its landmark lenses function. Snapchat filter applications use face detection technology and on the basis of the facial features identified in an image a 3D mesh mask is layered over the face. DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook. It identifies human faces in digital images. It employs a nine-layer neural net with over 120 million connection weights, and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users. The system is said to be 97% accurate, compared to 85% for the FBI's Next Generation Identification system. = ID verification = The emerging use of facial recognition is in the use of ID verification services. Many companies and others are working in the market now to provide these services to banks, ICOs, and other e-businesses. Face recognition has been leveraged as a form of biometric authentication for various computing platforms and devices; Android 4.0 \\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\" added facial recognition using a smartphone's front camera as a means of unlocking devices, while Microsoft introduced face recognition login to its Xbox 360 video game console through its Kinect accessory, as well as Windows 10 via its \\"Windows Hello\\" platform (which requires an infrared-illuminated camera). In 2017 Apple's iPhone X smartphone introduced facial recognition to the product line with its \\"Face ID\\" platform, which uses an infrared illumination system.  Face ID  Apple introduced Face ID on the flagship iPhone X as a biometric authentication successor to the Touch ID, a fingerprint based system. Face ID has a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts: a \\"Romeo\\" module that projects more than 30,000 infrared dots onto the user's face, and a \\"Juliet\\" module that reads the pattern. The pattern is sent to a local \\"Secure Enclave\\" in the device's central processing unit (CPU) to confirm a match with the phone owner's face. The facial pattern is not accessible by Apple. The system will not work with eyes closed, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access. The technology learns from changes in a user's appearance, and therefore works with hats, scarves, glasses, and many sunglasses, beard and makeup. It also works in the dark. This is done by using a \\"Flood Illuminator\\", which is a dedicated infrared flash that throws out invisible infrared light onto the user's face to properly read the 30,000 facial points. = Deployment in security services =  Commonwealth  The Australian Border Force and New Zealand Customs Service have set up an automated border processing system called SmartGate that uses face recognition, which compares the face of the traveller with the data in the e-passport microchip. All Canadian international airports use facial recognition as part of the Primary Inspection Kiosk program that compares a traveler face to their photo stored on the ePassport. This program first came to Vancouver International Airport in early 2017 and was rolled up to all remaining international airports in 2018‚Äì2019. Police forces in the United Kingdom have been trialing live facial recognition technology at public events since 2015. In May 2017, a man was arrested using an automatic facial recognition (AFR) system mounted on a van operated by the South Wales Police. Ars Technica reported that \\"this appears to be the first time [AFR] has led to an arrest\\". However, a 2018 report by Big Brother Watch found that these systems were up to 98% inaccurate. The report also revealed that two UK police forces, South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police, were using live facial recognition at public events and in public spaces. In September 2019, South Wales Police use of facial recognition was ruled lawful. Live facial recognition has been trialled since 2016 in the streets of London and will be used on a regular basis from Metropolitan Police from beginning of 2020. In August 2020 the Britain's Court of Appeal ruled that the way the facial recognition system had been used by the South Wales Police in 2017 and 2018 violated human rights.  United States  Flight boarding gate with \\"biometric face scanners\\" developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport. The U.S. Department of State operates one of the largest face recognition systems in the world with a database of 117 million American adults, with photos typically drawn from driver's license photos. Although it is still far from completion, it is being put to use in certain cities to give clues as to who was in the photo. The FBI uses the photos as an investigative tool, not for positive identification. As of 2016, facial recognition was being used to identify people in photos taken by police in San Diego and Los Angeles (not on real-time video, and only against booking photos) and use was planned in West Virginia and Dallas. In recent years Maryland has used face recognition by comparing people's faces to their driver's license photos. The system drew controversy when it was used in Baltimore to arrest unruly protesters after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. Many other states are using or developing a similar system however some states have laws prohibiting its use. The FBI has also instituted its Next Generation Identification program to include face recognition, as well as more traditional biometrics like fingerprints and iris scans, which can pull from both criminal and civil databases. The federal General Accountability Office criticized the FBI for not addressing various concerns related to privacy and accuracy. Starting in 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection deployed \\"biometric face scanners\\" at U.S. airports. Passengers taking outbound international flights can complete the check-in, security and the boarding process after getting facial images captured and verified by matching their ID photos stored on CBP's database. Images captured for travelers with U.S. citizenship will be deleted within up to 12-hours. TSA had expressed its intention to adopt a similar program for domestic air travel during the security check process in the future. The American Civil Liberties Union is one of the organizations against the program, concerning that the program will be used for surveillance purposes. In 2019, researchers reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses facial recognition software against state driver's license databases, including for some states that provide licenses to undocumented immigrants.ICE Uses Facial Recognition To Sift State Driver's License Records, Researchers Say China Boarding gates with facial recognition technology at Beijing West Railway Station As of late 2017, China has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology in Xinjiang. Reporters visiting the region found surveillance cameras installed every hundred meters or so in several cities, as well as facial recognition checkpoints at areas like gas stations, shopping centers, and mosque entrances. In May 2019, Human Rights Watch reported finding Face++ code in the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), a police surveillance app used to collect data on, and track the Uighur community in Xinjiang. Human Rights Watch released a correction to its report in June 2019 stating that the Chinese company Megvii did not appear to have collaborated on IJOP, and that the Face++ code in the app was inoperable. In February 2020, following the Coronavirus outbreak, Megvii applied for a bank loan to optimize the body temperature screening system it had launched to help identify people with symptoms of a Coronavirus infection in crowds. In the loan application Megvii stated that it needed to improve the accuracy of identifying masked individuals. Many public places in China are implemented with facial recognition equipment, including railway stations, airports, tourist attractions, expos, and office buildings. In October 2019, a professor at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University sued the Hangzhou Safari Park for abusing private biometric information of customers. The safari park uses facial recognition technology to verify the identities of its Year Card holders. An estimated 300 tourist sites in China have installed facial recognition systems and use them to admit visitors. This case is reported to be the first on the use of facial recognition systems in China. In August 2020 Radio Free Asia reported that in 2019 Geng Guanjun, a citizen of Taiyuan City who had used the WeChat app by Tencent to forward a video to a friend in the United States was susequently convicted on the charge of the crime ‚Äúpicking quarrels and provoking troubles‚Äù. The Court documents showed that the Chinese police used a facial recognition system to identify Geng Guanjun as an \\"overseas democracy activist\\" and that China's network management and propaganda departments directly monitor WeChat users.  Latin America  In the 2000 Mexican presidential election, the Mexican government employed face recognition software to prevent voter fraud. Some individuals had been registering to vote under several different names, in an attempt to place multiple votes. By comparing new face images to those already in the voter database, authorities were able to reduce duplicate registrations. The Tocumen International Airport in Panama operates an airport-wide surveillance system using hundreds of live face recognition cameras to identify wanted individuals passing through the airport.  The Netherlands  Like China, but a year earlier, The Netherlands has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology since 2016. The database of the Dutch police currently contains over 2.2 million pictures of 1.3 million Dutch citizens. This accounts for about 8% of the population. Hundreds of cameras have been deployed in the city of Amsterdam alone.Automatic Facial Recognition systems resemble other mobile CCTV systems South Africa In South Africa, in 2016, the city of Johannesburg announced it was rolling out smart CCTV cameras complete with automatic number plate recognition and facial recognition.How CCTV surveillance poses a threat to privacy in South Africa =Additional uses= At Super Bowl XXXV in January 2001, police in Tampa Bay, Florida used Viisage face recognition software to search for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event. 19 people with minor criminal records were potentially identified. Face recognition systems have also been used by photo management software to identify the subjects of photographs, enabling features such as searching images by person, as well as suggesting photos to be shared with a specific contact if their presence were detected in a photo. By 2008 facial recognition systems were typically used as access control in security systems. The United States' popular music and country music celebrity Taylor Swift surreptitiously employed facial recognition technology at a concert in 2018. The camera was embedded in a kiosk near a ticket booth and scanned concert-goers as they entered the facility for known stalkers. On August 18, 2019, The Times reported that the UAE-owned Manchester City hired a Texas- based firm, Blink Identity, to deploy facial recognition systems in a driver program. The club has planned a single super-fast lane for the supporters at the Etihad stadium. However, civil rights groups cautioned the club against the introduction of this technology, saying that it would risk ‚Äúnormalising a mass surveillance tool‚Äù. The policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, Hannah Couchman said that Man City's move is alarming, since the fans will be obliged to share deeply sensitive personal information with a private company, where they could be tracked and monitored in their everyday lives. In August 2020, Amid Corona virus, Football stadiums of New York and Los Angeles announced the instalment of facial recognition for upcoming matches. The purpose is to make the entry process as touch-less as possible. Advantages and disadvantages = Compared to other biometric systems = In 2006, the performance of the latest face recognition algorithms was evaluated in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC). High-resolution face images, 3-D face scans, and iris images were used in the tests. The results indicated that the new algorithms are 10 times more accurate than the face recognition algorithms of 2002 and 100 times more accurate than those of 1995. Some of the algorithms were able to outperform human participants in recognizing faces and could uniquely identify identical twins. One key advantage of a facial recognition system that it is able to person mass identification as it does not require the cooperation of the test subject to work. Properly designed systems installed in airports, multiplexes, and other public places can identify individuals among the crowd, without passers-by even being aware of the system. However, as compared to other biometric techniques, face recognition may not be most reliable and efficient. Quality measures are very important in facial recognition systems as large degrees of variations are possible in face images. Factors such as illumination, expression, pose and noise during face capture can affect the performance of facial recognition systems. Among all biometric systems, facial recognition has the highest false acceptance and rejection rates, thus questions have been raised on the effectiveness of face recognition software in cases of railway and airport security. =Weaknesses= Ralph Gross, a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in 2008, describes one obstacle related to the viewing angle of the face: \\"Face recognition has been getting pretty good at full frontal faces and 20 degrees off, but as soon as you go towards profile, there've been problems.\\" Besides the pose variations, low-resolution face images are also very hard to recognize. This is one of the main obstacles of face recognition in surveillance systems. Face recognition is less effective if facial expressions vary. A big smile can render the system less effective. For instance: Canada, in 2009, allowed only neutral facial expressions in passport photos. There is also inconstancy in the datasets used by researchers. Researchers may use anywhere from several subjects to scores of subjects and a few hundred images to thousands of images. It is important for researchers to make available the datasets they used to each other, or have at least a standard dataset.Albiol, A., Albiol, A., Oliver, J., Mossi, J.M.(2012). Who is who at different cameras: people re- identification using depth cameras. Computer Vision, IET. Vol 6(5), 378-387. Data privacy is the main concern when it comes to storing biometrics data in companies. Data stores about face or biometrics can be accessed by the third party if not stored properly or hacked. In the Techworld, Parris adds (2017), ‚ÄúHackers will already be looking to replicate people's faces to trick facial recognition systems, but the technology has proved harder to hack than fingerprint or voice recognition technology in the past.‚Äù = Ineffectiveness = Critics of the technology complain that the London Borough of Newham scheme has, , never recognized a single criminal, despite several criminals in the system's database living in the Borough and the system has been running for several years. \\"Not once, as far as the police know, has Newham's automatic face recognition system spotted a live target.\\" This information seems to conflict with claims that the system was credited with a 34% reduction in crime (hence why it was rolled out to Birmingham also). An experiment in 2002 by the local police department in Tampa, Florida, had similarly disappointing results. A system at Boston's Logan Airport was shut down in 2003 after failing to make any matches during a two-year test period. In 2014, Facebook stated that in a standardized two-option facial recognition test, its online system scored 97.25% accuracy, compared to the human benchmark of 97.5%. Systems are often advertised as having accuracy near 100%; this is misleading as the studies often use much smaller sample sizes than would be necessary for large scale applications. Because facial recognition is not completely accurate, it creates a list of potential matches. A human operator must then look through these potential matches and studies show the operators pick the correct match out of the list only about half the time. This causes the issue of targeting the wrong suspect.  Controversies  = Privacy violations = Civil rights organizations and privacy campaigners such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Big Brother Watch and the ACLU express concern that privacy is being compromised by the use of surveillance technologies. Face recognition can be used not just to identify an individual, but also to unearth other personal data associated with an individual ‚Äì such as other photos featuring the individual, blog posts, social media profiles, Internet behavior, and travel patterns. Concerns have been raised over who would have access to the knowledge of one's whereabouts and people with them at any given time. Moreover, individuals have limited ability to avoid or thwart face recognition tracking unless they hide their faces. This fundamentally changes the dynamic of day-to-day privacy by enabling any marketer, government agency, or random stranger to secretly collect the identities and associated personal information of any individual captured by the face recognition system. Consumers may not understand or be aware of what their data is being used for, which denies them the ability to consent to how their personal information gets shared. In July 2015, the United States Government Accountability Office conducted a Report to the Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate. The report discussed facial recognition technology's commercial uses, privacy issues, and the applicable federal law. It states that previously, issues concerning facial recognition technology were discussed and represent the need for updating the privacy laws of the United States so that federal law continually matches the impact of advanced technologies. The report noted that some industry, government, and private organizations were in the process of developing, or have developed, \\"voluntary privacy guidelines\\". These guidelines varied between the stakeholders, but their overall aim was to gain consent and inform citizens of the intended use of facial recognition technology. According to the report the voluntary privacy guidelines helped to counteract the privacy concerns that arise when citizens are unaware of how their personal data gets put to use. In 2016 Russian company NtechLab caused a privacy scandal in the international media when it launched the FindFace face recognition system with the promise that Russian users could take photos of strangers in the street and link them to a social media profile on the social media platform Vkontakte (VT). In December 2017, Facebook rolled out a new feature that notifies a user when someone uploads a photo that includes what Facebook thinks is their face, even if they are not tagged. Facebook has attempted to frame the new functionality in a positive light, amidst prior backlashes. Facebook's head of privacy, Rob Sherman, addressed this new feature as one that gives people more control over their photos online. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve thought about this as a really empowering feature,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere may be photos that exist that you don‚Äôt know about.‚Äù Facebook's DeepFace has become the subject of several class action lawsuits under the Biometric Information Privacy Act, with claims alleging that Facebook is collecting and storing face recognition data of its users without obtaining informed consent, in direct violation of the 2008 Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The most recent case was dismissed in January 2016 because the court lacked jurisdiction. In 2019 the Financial Times first reported that facial recognition software was in use in the King's Cross area of London. The development around London's King's Cross mainline station includes shops, offices, Google's UK HQ and part of St Martin's College. According to the UK Information Commissioner's Office: \\"Scanning people's faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives, in order to identify them, is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all.\\" The UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham launched an investigation into the use of the King's Cross facial recognition system, operated by the company Argent. In September 2019 it was announced by Argent that facial recognition software would no longer be used at King's Cross. Argent claimed that the software had been deployed between May 2016 and March 2018 on two cameras covering a pedestrian street running through the centre of the development. In October 2019 a report by the deputy London mayor Sophie Linden revealed that in a secret deal the Metropolitan Police had passed photos of seven people to Argent for use in their King's cross facial recognition system. = Imperfect technology in law enforcement = All over the world, law enforcement agencies have begun using facial recognition software to aid in the identifying of criminals. For example, the Chinese police force were able to identify twenty-five wanted suspects using facial recognition equipment at the Qingdao International Beer Festival, one of which had been on the run for 10 years. The equipment works by recording a 15-second video clip and taking multiple snapshots of the subject. That data is compared and analyzed with images from the police department's database and within 20 minutes, the subject can be identified with a 98.1% accuracy. It is still contested as to whether or not facial recognition technology works less accurately on people of color. One study by Joy Buolamwini (MIT Media Lab) and Timnit Gebru (Microsoft Research) found that the error rate for gender recognition for women of color within three commercial facial recognition systems ranged from 23.8% to 36%, whereas for lighter-skinned men it was between 0.0 and 1.6%. Overall accuracy rates for identifying men (91.9%) were higher than for women (79.4%), and none of the systems accommodated a non-binary understanding of gender. However, another study showed that several commercial facial recognition software sold to law enforcement offices around the country had a lower false non-match rate for black people than for white people. Experts fear that face recognition systems may actually be hurting citizens the police claims they are trying to protect. It is considered an imperfect biometric, and in a study conducted by Georgetown University researcher Clare Garvie, she concluded that \\"there‚Äôs no consensus in the scientific community that it provides a positive identification of somebody.‚Äù It is believed that with such large margins of error in this technology, both legal advocates and facial recognition software companies say that the technology should only supply a portion of the case ‚Äì no evidence that can lead to an arrest of an individual. The lack of regulations holding facial recognition technology companies to requirements of racially biased testing can be a significant flaw in the adoption of use in law enforcement. CyberExtruder, a company that markets itself to law enforcement said that they had not performed testing or research on bias in their software. CyberExtruder did note that some skin colors are more difficult for the software to recognize with current limitations of the technology. ‚ÄúJust as individuals with very dark skin are hard to identify with high significance via facial recognition, individuals with very pale skin are the same,‚Äù said Blake Senftner, a senior software engineer at CyberExtruder. = Data protection = According to Article 9(1) of the EU's 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the processing of biometric data for the purpose of \\"uniquely identifying a natural person\\" is sensitive and the facial recognition data processed in this way becomes sensitive personal data. In response to the GDPR passing into the law of EU member states, EU based researchers voiced concern that if they were required under the GDPR to obtain individual's consent for the processing of their facial recognition data, a face database on the scale of MegaFace could never be established again. In September 2019 the Swedish Data Protection Authority (DPA) issued its first ever financial penalty for a violation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) against a school that was using the technology to replace time-consuming roll calls during class. The DPA found that the school illegally obtained the biometric data of its students without completing an impact assessment. In addition the school did not make the DPA aware of the pilot scheme. A 200,000 SEK fine (‚Ç¨19,000/$21,000) was issued.  Bans on the use of facial recognition technology In May 2019, San Francisco, California became the first major United States city to ban the use of facial recognition software for police and other local government agencies' usage. San Francisco Supervisor, Aaron Peskin, introduced regulations that will require agencies to gain approval from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to purchase surveillance technology. The regulations also require that agencies publicly disclose the intended use for new surveillance technology. In June 2019, Somerville, Massachusetts became the first city on the East Coast to ban face surveillance software for government use, specifically in police investigations and municipal surveillance. In July 2019, Oakland, California banned the usage of facial recognition technology by city departments. The American Civil Liberties Union (\\"ACLU\\") has campaigned across the United States for transparency in surveillance technology and has supported both San Francisco and Somerville's ban on facial recognition software. The ACLU works to challenge the secrecy and surveillance with this technology. In January 2020, the European Union suggested, but then quickly scrapped, a proposed moratorium on facial recognition in public spaces. The 2020 Defund the Police protests. While the officers per capita in major cities have not significantly changed, they have been equipped with more technology, gear, and training in the last few decades. During the George Floyd protests, use of facial recognition by city government was banned in Boston, Massachusetts.Boston mayor OKs ban on facial recognition tech As of June 10, 2020, municipal use has been banned in:IBM bows out of facial recognition market * Berkeley, California * Oakland, California * Boston, Massachusetts - June 30, 2020Boston mayor OKs ban on facial recognition tech * Brookline, Massachusetts * Cambridge, Massachusetts * Northampton, Massachusetts * Springfield, Massachusetts * Somerville, Massachusetts * Portland, Oregon - September, 2020 Emotion recognition In the 18th and 19th century the belief that facial expressions revealed the moral worth or true inner state of a human was widespread and physiognomy was a respected science in the Western world. From the early 19th century onwards photography was used in the physiognomic analysis of facial features and facial expression to detect insanity and dementia. In the 1960s and 1970s the study of human emotions and its expressions was reinvented by psychologists, who tried to define a normal range of emotional responses to events. The research on automated emotion recognition has since the 1970s focused on facial expressions and speech, which are regarded as the two most important ways in which humans communicate emotions to other humans. In the 1970s the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) categorization for the physical expression of emotions was established. Its developer Paul Ekman maintains that there are six emotions that are universal to all human beings and that these can be coded in facial expressions. Research into automatic emotion specific expression recognition has in the past decades focused on frontal view images of human faces. In 2016 facial feature emotion recognition algorithms were among the new technologies, alongside high-definition CCTV, high resolution 3D face recognition and iris recognition, that found their way out of university research labs. In 2016 Facebook acquired FacioMetrics, a facial feature emotion recognition corporate spin-off by Carnegie Mellon University. In the same year Apple Inc. acquired the facial feature emotion recognition start-up Emotient. By the end of 2016 commercial vendors of facial recognition systems offered to integrate and deploy emotion recognition algorithms for facial features. The MIT's Media Lab spin-off Affectiva by late 2019 offered a facial expression emotion detection product that can recognize emotions in humans while driving. Anti-facial recognition systems In January 2013 Japanese researchers from the National Institute of Informatics created 'privacy visor' glasses that use nearly infrared light to make the face underneath it unrecognizable to face recognition software. The latest version uses a titanium frame, light- reflective material and a mask which uses angles and patterns to disrupt facial recognition technology through both absorbing and bouncing back light sources. Some projects use adversarial machine learning to come up with new printed patterns that confuse existing face recognition software. Another method to protect from facial recognition systems are specific haircuts and make-up patterns that prevent the used algorithms to detect a face, known as computer vision dazzle. Incidentally, the makeup styles popular with Juggalos can also protect against facial recognition. Facial masks that are worn to protect from contagious viruses can reduce the accuracy of facial recognition systems. A 2020 NIST study tested popular one-to-one matching systems and found a failure rate between five and fifty percent on masked individuals. The Verge speculated that the accuracy rate of mass surveillance systems, which were not included in the study, would be even less accurate than the accuracy of one-to-one matching systems. The facial recognition of Apple Pay can work through many barriers, including heavy makeup, thick beards and even sunglasses, but fails with masks.

He usurped the Swedish throne, but was killed by his nephew Eadgils, who won by hiring foreign assistance. In Scandinavian mythology a Norwegian king by the same name exists, √Åli (the Old Norse form of Onela, also rendered as Ole, √Öle or Ale), who had the cognomen hinn Upplenzki (\\"from Oppland\\").  Etymology  The name stems from the Proto-Norse *Anula (diminutive with l-suffix to a name starting with *Anu-, or directly of an appellative *anuz, \\"ancestor\\").(Lexicon of nordic personal names before the 8th century)  Beowulf  In the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, Onela plays a central part in the Swedish-Geatish wars. Onela and his brother Ohthere were the sons of the Swedish king Ongen√æeow. When the Geatish king Hre√∞el died, Onela and Ohthere saw the opportunity to pillage in Geatland starting the Swedish-Geatish wars: {  :√ûa w√¶s synn and sacu Sweona and Geata, :ofer wid w√¶ter wroht gem√¶ne, :here-ni√∞ hearda, sy√∞√∞an Hre√∞el swealt, :o√∞√∞e him Ongen√æeowes eaferan w√¶ran :frome fyrd-hwate, freode ne woldon :ofer heafo healdan, ac ymb Hreosna-beorh :eatolne inwit-scear oft gefremedon.Lines 2473‚Äì2480.  :There was strife and struggle 'twixt Swede and Geat :o'er the width of waters; war arose, :hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died, :and Ongentheow's offspring grew :strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o'er the seas :pact of peace, but pushed their hosts :to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.Modern English translation by Francis Barton Gummere  } The war ended with Ongen√æeow's death.Lines 2485‚Äì2490, 2977‚Äì2982 It is implied by the poem that Onela eventually became king, because Ohthere's two sons, Eanmund and Eadgils, had to seek refuge with Heardred, Hygelac's successor as king of the Geats.Lines 2380‚Äì2391 This caused Onela to attack the Geats. During the battle, Eanmund was killed by Onela's champion WeohstanLines 2610‚Äì2617 and Heardred was killed as well,Line 2389 after which Onela returned home.Lines 2388‚Äì2391 Eadgils, however, survived and later, Beowulf helped him avenge Eanmund by slaying Onela.Line 2392‚Äì2397 By a conjectural emendation of line 62 of this poem some editors represent Onela as the son-in-law of Healfdene/Halfdan king of Denmark.  Norse sagas  The animosity between Eadgils and Onela also appears in Scandinavian tradition. In the Norse sagas, which were mostly based on Norwegian versions of Scandinavian legends, Onela seems to appear as √Åli of Uppland, and is called Norwegian. By the time Ynglingatal was used as a source by Snorri Sturluson, there appears no longer to have been a Scandinavian tradition of √Åli as a relation of Eadgils. The earliest extant Scandinavian source where Onela appears is the 9th century skaldic poem Ynglingatal, Eadgils (A√∞ils) is called Onela's enemy (√Åla d√≥lgr). √Åla is the genitive case of √Åli, the Old Norse form of the name Onela. {  :√ûat fr√° ek enn, :at A√∞ils fj√∂rvi :vitta vettr :um vi√∞a skyldi, :ok d√°√∞gjarn :af drasils b√≥gum :Freys √°ttungr :falla skyldi. :Ok vi√∞ aur :≈ìgir hjarna :bragnings burs :um blandinn var√∞; :ok d√°√∞s√¶ll :deyja skyldi :√Åla d√≥lgr :at Upps√∂lum.The Ynglinga saga in Old Norse  :Witch-demons, I have heard men say, :Have taken Adils' life away. :The son of kings of Frey's great race, :First in the fray, the fight, the chase, :Fell from his steedhis clotted brains :Lie mixed with mire on Upsal's plains. :Such death (grim Fate has willed it so) :Has struck down Ole's [Onela's] deadly foe.Laing's translation  } In Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, compiled by Snorri Sturluson and in Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson's Latin summary of Skj√∂ldunga saga, the battle hinted at in Beowulf is treated in more detail. Snorri first quotes the K√°lfsv√≠sa but only small parts of it:Nerman 1925:102 {  :Ali Hrafni, :es til √≠ss ri√∞u, :en annarr austr :und A√∞ilsi :gr√°r hvarfa√∞i, :geiri unda√∞r.heimskringla.no ‚Äì Eddukv√¶√∞i : Eddubrot  :√Åli rode Hrafn, :They who rode onto the ice: :But another, southward, :Under Adils, :A gray one, wandered, :Wounded with the spear.  } Snorri then relates that A√∞ils was in war with a Norwegian king named √Åli, and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern. A√∞ils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hr√≥lfr (Hro√∞ulf) and so sent an embassy to Hr√≥lfr asking him for help against √Åli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense. Hr√≥lfr was involved in a war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including B√∂dvar Bjarki. √Åli died in the war, and A√∞ils took √Åli's helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that A√∞ils had promised Hr√≥lfr, that is the two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat Finn's heritage. They also wanted the famous ring Sv√≠agris. A√∞ils considered the pay outrageous and refused. In the Ynglinga saga, Snorri relates that king Eadgils fought hard battles with the Norwegian king who was called √Åli hinn upplenzki. They fought on the ice of Lake V√§nern, where √Åli fell and Adils won. Snorri relates that much is told about this event in the Skj√∂ldunga saga, and that Adils took Hrafn (Raven), √Åli's horse. The Saga of the Skj√∂ldungs is lost but in the end of the 16th century, Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson saved a piece of information from this saga in Latin. He wrote: There was animosity between king Adils of Sweden and the Norwegian king √Åli of Uppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake V√§nern. Adils won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse.  Notes   Secondary sources  Nerman, B., Det svenska rikets uppkomst.

It is a branch of applied linguistics. There are principally three areas of application for linguists working in forensic contexts: * understanding language of the written law, * understanding language use in forensic and judicial processes, and * the provision of linguistic evidence. The discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogeneous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field. History The phrase forensic linguistics first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a professor of linguistics, used it in an analysis of statements by Timothy John Evans.John Olsson (2008), Forensic Linguistics, Second Edition. London: Continuum It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at Notting Hill police station, England, in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby, and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial.Olsson, John. \\"What Is Forensic Linguistics?‚Äù www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up ‚Äì the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements. Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of the Miranda Rights and pushed the focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant ‚Äì leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations. During the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out. Forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reportedAssociated Press. \\"Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note\\" in \\"Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note\\" \\"Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling.\\" Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their Miranda rights during the interrogation process.Olsson, John. \\"What Is Forensic Linguistics?\\" www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant McDonald's claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as McWords) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'. In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues. They discovered that a phrase such as the same language is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally- based interactional styles to the interview. The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline, as it spread to many countries around the world, from Europe to Australia and Japan.Okawara, Mami Hiraike (2018). The Interdisciplinary Study of Law and Language: Forensic Linguistics in Japan. In D. G. Hebert (Ed.), International Perspectives on Translation, Education and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies. Cham: Springer, p.197-206. Today, not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017,Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics. 2017. \\"Gr√ºndung der √ñsterreichischen Gesellschaft f√ºr Rechtslinguistik.

The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics. London: Routledge, 1 Areas of study The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas: =The language of legal texts= The study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context. This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area is that of the transformative effect of Norman French and Ecclesiastic Latin on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it. It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making legal language more comprehensible to laypeople. One part of the language of legal texts encompasses the Miranda warning in the United States. These warnings let the defendant know that they have the right to be silent since whatever they say from the point they are in police custody can and will be used against them in a court of law. The recipients who are advised of these rights must have a certain level of competency in the English language in order to completely understand the warning. =The language of legal processes= Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews. Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase \\"requests\\" as \\"commands\\", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. & Tiersma, P, 2005). When a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. A defendant's ambiguity may be deemed unacceptable. The language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013). Lawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013). The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013). Since language can be used to elicit responses in the legal process, the right to an interpreter plays a part in the fairness of the trial. \\"The right to an interpreter is essentially a procedural right that derives from the right to a fair trial: everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to certain minimum procedural guarantees, and these include the right to the free assistance of an interpreter where s/he cannot understand or speak the language of the concerned court.\\" Forensic text types =Emergency call= In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Emphasis on intonation, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analyzing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses. Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter. =Ransom demands or other threat communication= Threat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the Lindbergh kidnapping, where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: \\"We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care\\" (sic). From the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands but to make such a claim, the note would have to be written before the perpetrator enters the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note. Kidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as \\"your child is being held in a private location\\" being written ahead of time. Ransom demands in the style of written notes have been present in many notable cases. The style of writing used in ransom notes are examined by forensic linguists in order to determine the writing's true intent, as well as determining who wrote the note. Forensic linguists look at factors such as syntactic structures, stylistic patterns, punctuation and even spelling while analyzing ransom notes. In the case of the Lindbergh ransom note forensic linguists compared similarities of writing styles from the note to that of writing of the suspect, creating a better chance at discovering who wrote the note. =Suicide letters= Stefan Zweig Suicide Letter A suicide note is typically brief, concise and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness. A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees) and relevant to the relationship between them. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken. The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length. Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.John Olsson (2004). An Introduction to Language Crime and the Law. London: Continuum International Publishing Group =Death row statements= Death row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness; or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence or seek an element of revenge in their last moments (Olsson 2004). Death row statements are within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons. The Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them. =Social media= Social media statements are often context specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts has been done in relation to Facebook. Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).C. Hardaker (2015). The ethics of online aggression: Where does \\"virtual\\" end, and \\"reality\\" begin? BAAL Conference on The Ethics of Online Research Methods. Cardiff. Use of linguistic evidence in legal proceedings These areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in: * Trademark and other intellectual property disputes * Disputes of meaning and use * Author identification (determining who wrote an anonymous text by making comparisons to known writing samples of a suspect; such as threat letters, mobile phone texts or emails) * Forensic stylistics (identifying cases of plagiarism) * Voice identification, also known as forensic phonetics, used to determine, through acoustic qualities, if the voice on a tape recorder is that of the defendant) * Discourse analysis (the analysis of the structure of written or spoken utterance to determine who is introducing topics or whether a suspect is agreeing to engage in criminal conspiracy) * Language analysis (forensic dialectology) tracing the linguistic history of asylum seekers (Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin) * Reconstruction of mobile phone text conversations * Forensic phonetics Specialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called corpora) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records and witness statements. They are used to analyse language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates). =Author identification= The identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their idiolect,Coulthard, M. (2004). Author identification, idiolect and linguistic uniqueness. Applied Linguistics, 25(4), 431-447. or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. William Labov has stated that nobody has found a \\"homogenous data\\" in idiolects,Labov, William (1972) Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, p192. and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence. Firstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired.Miller, C. (1984). \\"Genre as social action.\\" Quarterly Journal of Speech, pp 151-167 Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual's use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use. Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.Grant, T. D. (2008). Approaching questions in forensic authorship analysis. In J. Gibbons & M. T. Turell (Eds.), Dimensions of Forensic Linguistics. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. The paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects. Authorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, article frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries) and the measurements of hapax legomena (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include factor analysis, Bayesian statistics, Poisson distribution, multivariate analysis, and discriminant function analysis of function words. The Cusum (Cumulative Sum) method for text analysis has also been developed.Morton, A.Q., and S. Michaelson (1990) The Qsum Plot. Internal Report CSR-3-90, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh. Cusum analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two to three letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel- initial words. In order to carry out the Cusum test on habits of utilizing two to three letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The Cusum distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text. =Forensic stylistics= This discipline subjects written or spoken materials (or both), to scientific analysis for determination and measurement of content, meaning, speaker identification, or determination of authorship in identifying plagiarism. One of the earliest cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect plagiarism was the case of Helen Keller's short story \\"The Frost King\\" in which the deaf-blind American author was accused of plagiarism in 1892. An investigation revealed that The Frost King had been plagiarised from Margaret Canby's Frost Fairies which had been read to Keller some time earlier. Keller was found to have made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas. Keller used 'vast wealth' instead of \\"treasure\\" (230 times less common in the language) \\"bethought\\" instead of \\"concluded\\" (approximately 450 times less common), \\"bade them\\" instead of \\"told them\\" (approximately 30 times less common) . Keller used the phrase \\"ever since that time,\\" but Canby chose \\"from that time\\" (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used \\"I cannot imagine,\\" but Canby used \\"I do not know.\\" \\"Know\\" is approximately ten times more common than \\"imagine.\\" Keller relied on a lexis that is less common than that of Canby. The Flesch and Flesch-Kincaid readability test showed that Canby's text showing more originality than Keller's. Canby's text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller's. The distinctions between Keller and Canby's text are at the lexical and phrasal level. Other examples of plagiarism include the cases between Richard Condon, author of The Manchurian Candidate and English novelist Robert Graves and between Martin Luther King Jr. and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in The Manchurian Candidate, Condon's work is seen to be rich in clich√©s such as \\"in his superstitious heart of hearts.\\" While Helen Keller took pride in using rare phrases and avoided common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves' work. However, in the plagiarism case between King and Archibald Carey, almost half of King's doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more alliteration and assonance. Carey's and Graves' texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier and simpler in structure while Condon's and King's texts relied on 'purple' devices, extending the existing text and flourish their language significantly. Another famous example is that in the case of Theodore Kaczynski, who was eventually convicted of being the \\"Unabomber,\\" family members recognized his writing style in the published 35,000-word Industrial Society and Its Future (commonly called the \\"Unabomber Manifesto\\") and then notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski's hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents.Fitzgerald, J. R. (2004). \\"Using a forensic linguistic approach to tracking the Unabomber.\\" In J. Campbell, & D. DeNevi (Eds.)Profilers: Leading investigators take you inside the criminal mind (pp. 193-222). New York: Prometheus Books. Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with one another. =Discourse analysis= Discourse analysis deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant semiotic event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. The use of 'I' instead of 'We' in a recording highlights non-complicity in a conspiracy. The utterance of 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' as responses indicate that the suspect understands the suggestion, while feedback markers such as 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' do not denote the suspect's agreement to the suggestion. Discourse analysts are not always allowed to testify but during preparation for a case they are often useful to lawyers. =Linguistic dialectology= This refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual's origin by means of his/her language or dialect. Dialectology was used during the investigations into the Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax.Martin Fido (1994), The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes =Forensic phonetics= The forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker's social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings. Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e., alleged criminal. A man accused of manufacturing the drug ecstasy was mis-heard by the police transcriber as 'hallucinogenic'Coulthard, M., & Johnson, A. (2007). An introduction to forensic linguistics: Language in evidence. Oxford: Routledge:162-3. The police transcriber heard \\"but if it's as you say it's hallucinogenic, it's in the Sigma catalogue.\\" However, the actual utterance was \\"but if it's as you say it's German, it's in the Sigma catalogue.\\" Another disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as 'Ernie'. The poor signal of the recording made 'Ernie' sound like 'Ronnie'. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding cackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name. Forensic speechreading is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record. =Examples= Evidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty. Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime, and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of hate mail; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist's diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect's police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of Derek Bentley the identification of Subcomandante Marcos, the Zapatistas' charismatic leader by Max Appedole and the identification of Theodore Kaczynski as the so-called \\"Unabomber\\" by James R. Fitzgerald. The criminal laboratories Bundeskriminalamt (in Germany) and the Nederlands Forensisch Instituut (in the Netherlands) both employ forensic linguists. Forensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of Derek Bentley's conviction for murder in 1998 although there were other non- linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was functionally illiterate, had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken monologue. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word \\"then\\" in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley's posthumous pardon.Coulthard, R.M. (2000). \\" Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship \\", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: Discourse and Social Life. London, Longman. During the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the Mexican government speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos' identity.¬´El otro subcomandante¬ª They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued and arrests were made in a military action. The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On 9 February 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President Ernesto Zedillo announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebasti√°n Guill√©n Vicente, born 19 June 1957, in Tampico, Tamaulipas to Spanish immigrants, an Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana School of Sciences and Arts for the Design former Professor. And after the government revealed Marcos' identity in January 1995, when Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the Jesuits at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a Military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guill√©n, was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos' linguistic fingerprint based on Marcos' specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the Jesuits in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an idiolect, encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guill√©n, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements this new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics called Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.S√≠ es Sebasti√°n Guill√©n¬ªOtra Campana Pintada de Azul¬ªMaestros y condisc√≠pulos de Tampico recuerdan a Rafael Guill√©n¬ª Forensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in Yorkshire. After she was reported missing, her partner received several text messages from Julie's mobile phone, such as \\"Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out\\", and \\"Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things\\".Speech Patterns in Messages Betray a Killer, Elizabeth Svoboda, The New York Times 11 May 2009 Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages.Dear Garry. I've decided to end it all: The full stop that trapped a killer, Daily Mail, 3 July 2009 Simmerson was eventually found guilty of Turner's murder. 19-year-old Jenny Nicholl disappeared on 30 June 2005. Her body was never found, giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different than her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David's texting style and the messages sent from Jenny's phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny's murderer, David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics. Forensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of 'jooking' in connection with a stabbing.Trial of Rehan Asghar, Central Criminal Court, London, January 2008. During the appeal against the conviction of the Bridgewater Four, the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants - a confession which he had retracted immediately - and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence. In an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a \\"farewell letter\\" had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analysed included sentence breaks, marked themes, and deletion of prepositions.Eagleson, Robert. (1994). 'Forensic analysis of personal written texts: a case study', John Gibbons (ed.), Language and the Law, London: Longman, 362-373. In 2009‚ÄúMan Jailed over Wife Fire Murder.‚Äù BBC News, BBC, 11 Dec. 2009, news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/staffordshire/8408020.stm., there was a horrible house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead was a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phone of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother's phone the whole day ‚Äì long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day‚ÄúProfessor Tim Grant.‚Äù Aston University, Aston University, www2.aston.ac.uk/lss/staff-directory/grantt.. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife's phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband's texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased, was actually the husband texting off her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of murder and get justice for the family. Additional concepts =Linguistic fingerprinting= A linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique; similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint. It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone).Pennebaker, J. W. (1990). 'Physiological factors influencing the reporting of physical symptoms'. The Science of Self-report: Implications for Research and Practice. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum Publishers, pp. 299-316 In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion. =Variation= Intra- author variations are the ways in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors. *Genre: When texts are being measured in different genres, considerable variation is observed even though they are by the same author. *Text Type: Personal letters contain more inter-relationship bonding strategies than academic articles or term papers. *Fiction vs. Non- Fiction: Some fiction writers are journalists. Due to the different demands of each medium, they can be completely different from one another and this results in intra-author variation. *Private vs Public: A politician writing a political speech, which is a public text, will differ greatly from a private text to a friend or family member. *Time lapse: The greater the time lapse between two works, the greater the likely variation. Language changes more than we realize in a relatively short span of time, influencing our susceptibility to language changes around us. *Disguise: A writer can publish pseudonymously or anonymously, disguising output to prevent recognition. =Forensic transcription= The two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily. Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.

Hermann Hupfeld (31 March 1796 - 24 April 1866) was a Protestant German Orientalist and Biblical commentator. He is known for his historical-critical studies of the Old Testament.Hupfeld , Hermann @ NDB/ADB Deutsche Biographie He was born at Marburg, where he studied philosophy and theology from 1813 to 1817. In 1819 he became a teacher in the gymnasium at Hanau, but in 1822 resigned that appointment. After studying for some time at Halle, he in 1824 settled as Privatdozent in philosophy at that university, and in the following year was appointed extraordinary professor of theology at Marburg. There he received professorships of theology and Oriental languages in 1825 and 1827 respectively. Sixteen years later he returned to Halle as a successor of Wilhelm Gesenius. In 1865 he was accused by some theologians of the Hengstenberg school of heretical doctrines. From this charge, however, he successfully cleared himself, the entire theological faculty, including Julius M√ºller and August Tholuck, bearing testimony to his sufficient orthodoxy. He died at Halle on 24 April 1866. His earliest works in the department of Semitic philology (Exercitationes Aethiopicae, 1825, and De emendanda ratione lexicographiae Semiticae, 1827) were followed by the first part (1841), mainly historical and critical, of an Ausf√ºhrliche Hebr√§ische Grammatik, which he did not live to complete, and by a treatise on the early history of Hebrew grammar among the Jews (De rei grammaticae apud Judaeos initiis antiquissimisque scriptoribus, Halle, 1846).ADB: Hupfeld, Hermann @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie His principal contribution to Biblical literature, the exegetical and critical Die Psalmen. √úbersetzt und ausgelegt, began to appear in 1855, and was completed in 1861 (2nd ed. by E.

It was secretly jointly owned by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and West German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1970 until about 1993, with the CIA continuing as sole owner until about 2018. With headquarters in Steinhausen, the company was a long-established manufacturer of encryption machines and a wide variety of cipher devices. The company had about 230 employees, had offices in Abidjan, Abu Dhabi, Buenos Aires, Kuala Lumpur, Muscat, Selsdon and Steinhausen, and did business throughout the world. The owners of Crypto AG were unknown, supposedly even to the managers of the firm, and they held their ownership through bearer shares. The company has been criticised for selling backdoored products to benefit the American, British and German national signals intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and the BND, respectively. On 11 February 2020, The Washington Post, ZDF and SRF revealed that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence, and the spy agencies could easily break the codes used to send encrypted messages. The operation was known first by the code name \\"Thesaurus\\" and later \\"Rubicon\\".  History  Crypto AG was established in Switzerland by the Russian-born Swede, Boris Hagelin. Originally called AB Cryptoteknik and founded by Arvid Gerhard Damm in Stockholm in 1920, the firm manufactured the C-36 mechanical cryptograph machine that Damm had patented. After Damm's death, and just before the Second World War, Cryptoteknik came under the control of Hagelin, an early investor. Hagelin's hope was to sell the device to the United States Army. When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, he moved from Sweden to the US and presented the device to the military, which in turn brought the device to the Signal Intelligence Service, and the code-breakers in Arlington Hall. In the end he was awarded a licensing agreement. 140,000 units were made during the war for American troops. During his time in America, Hagelin became close friends with William F. Friedman, who in 1952 became chief cryptologist for the National Security Agency (NSA) and whom Hagelin had known since the 1930s. The same year, Hagelin's lawyer, Stuart Hedden, became deputy commander in CIA, Inspector General. In 1948 Hagelin moved to Steinhausen in Switzerland to avoid taxes. In 1952 the company, which until then had been incorporated in Stockholm, also moved to Switzerland. The official reason was that it was transferred as a result of a planned Swedish government nationalization of militarily important technology contractors. A holding company was set up in Liechtenstein. During the 1950s, Hagelin and Friedman had frequent mail correspondence, both personal and business alike. Crypto AG sent over new machines to the NSA and they had an ongoing discussion concerning which countries they would or would not sell the encryption systems to, and which countries to sell older, weaker systems. In 1958 when Friedman retired, Howard C. Barlow, a high-ranking NSA employee, and Lawrence E. Shinn, NSA's signal intelligence directory in Asia, took over the correspondence. In June 1970, the company was bought in secret by the CIA and the West-German intelligence service, BND, for $5.75 million. Hagelin had first been approached to sell to a partnership between the French and West-German intelligence services in 1967, but Hagelin contacted CIA and the Americans did not cooperate with the French. At this point, the company had 400 employees and the revenue increased from 100,000 Swiss franc in the 1950s to 14 million Swiss franc in the 1970s. In 1994, Crypto AG bought InfoGuard AG a company providing encryption solutions to banks. In 2010, Crypto AG sold G.V. LLC, a Wyoming company providing encryption and interception solutions for communications. In 2018, Crypto AG was liquidated, and its assets and intellectual property sold to two new companies. CyOne was created for Swiss domestic sales, while Crypto International AG was founded in 2018 by Swedish entrepreneur Andreas Linde, who acquired the brand name, international distribution network, and product rights from the original Crypto AG.  Products  The CX-52 The company had radio, Ethernet, STM, GSM, phone and fax encryption systems in its portfolio. Machines: *C-52 *CX-52 *CD-57 *HX-63  Compromised machines  According to declassified (but partly redacted) US government documents released in 2015, in 1955 (just after encryption was added to the US Munitions List on November 17, 1954) Crypto AG's founder Boris Hagelin and William Friedman entered into an unwritten agreement concerning the C-52 encryption machines that compromised the security of some of the purchasers. Friedman was a notable US government cryptographer who was then working for the National Security Agency (NSA), the main United States signals intelligence agency. Hagelin kept both NSA and its United Kingdom counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), informed about the technical specifications of different machines and which countries were buying which machines. Providing such information would have allowed the intelligence agencies to reduce the time needed to crack the encryption of messages produced by such machines from impossibly long to a feasible length. The secret relationship initiated by the agreement also involved Crypto AG not selling machines such as the CX-52, a more advanced version of the C-52, to certain countries; and the NSA writing the operations manuals for some of the CX-52 machines on behalf of the company, to ensure the full strength of the machines would not be used, thus again reducing the necessary cracking effort. Crypto AG had already earlier been accused of rigging its machines in collusion with intelligence agencies such as NSA, GCHQ, and the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), enabling the agencies to read the encrypted traffic produced by the machines. Suspicions of this collusion were aroused in 1986 following US president Ronald Reagan's announcement on national television that, through interception of diplomatic communications between Tripoli and the Libyan embassy in East Berlin, he had irrefutable evidence that Muammar Gaddafi of Libya was behind the West Berlin discotheque bombing in 1986. President Reagan then ordered the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation. There is no conclusive evidence that there was an intercepted Libyan message. Further evidence suggesting that the Crypto AG machines were compromised was revealed after the assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar in 1991. On 7 August 1991, one day before Bakhtiar's body was discovered, the Iranian Intelligence Service transmitted a coded message to Iranian embassies, inquiring \\"Is Bakhtiar dead?\\" Western governments were able to decipher this transmission, causing Iranian suspicion to fall upon their Crypto AG equipment. The Iranian government then arrested Crypto AG's top salesman, Hans Buehler, in March 1992 in Tehran. It accused Buehler of leaking their encryption codes to Western intelligence. Buehler was interrogated for nine months but, being completely unaware of any flaw in the machines, was released in January 1993 after Crypto AG posted bail of $1m to Iran. Soon after Buehler's release Crypto AG dismissed him and sought to recover the $1m bail money from him personally. Swiss media and the German magazine Der Spiegel took up his case in 1994, interviewing former employees and concluding that Crypto's machines had in fact repeatedly been rigged. Crypto AG rejected these accusations as \\"pure invention\\", asserting in a press release that \\"in March 1994, the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office initiated a wide-ranging preliminary investigation against Crypto AG, which was completed in 1997. The accusations regarding influence by third parties or manipulations, which had been repeatedly raised in the media, proved to be without foundation.\\" Subsequent commentators were unmoved by this denial, stating that it was likely that Crypto AG products were indeed rigged. Le Temps has argued that Crypto AG had been actively working with the British, US and West German secret services since 1956, going as far as to rig instruction manuals for the machines on the orders of the NSA. These claims were vindicated by US government documents declassified in 2015. In 2020, an investigation carried out by The Washington Post, Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), and Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF) revealed that Crypto AG was, in fact, entirely controlled by the CIA and the BND. The project, initially known by codename \\"Thesaurus\\" and later as \\"Rubicon\\" operated from the end of the Second World War until 2018. The Swiss government's decision to impose export controls on Crypto International in the wake of the Crypto AG disclosures caused diplomatic tensions with Sweden, reportedly leading to the latter cancelling plans to celebrate 100 years of diplomatic relations with Switzerland. The export controls preventing Swedish authorities from obtaining equipment from Crypto International was reportedly a reason behind Sweden's decision.

It introduces the research by academics and other free-thinkers into Dust, a mysterious subatomic particle related to consciousness, and the origins of Lyra's \\"alethiometer\\". The second book, The Secret Commonwealth, was published on 3 October 2019 and is set after the events in the original trilogy with Lyra as a twenty-year-old undergraduate.http://pullman.davidficklingbooks.com/publication?pubID=262 As of 3 October 2019, work on the third book in the series had not commenced. Pullman said the trilogy addresses consciousness: \\"Perhaps the oldest philosophical question of all: are we matter? Or are we spirit and matter? What is consciousness if there is no spirit? Questions like that are of perennial fascination and they haven‚Äôt been solved yet, thank goodness.\\" He added that the series might be slightly darker than the original, and quipped that it alternatively be titled \\"His Darker Materials\\". History of the book Pullman conceived The Book of Dust before the publication of Lyra's Oxford in 2003. On his website in April 2005, he wrote that the book was \\"under way\\". In 2007, he described it as \\"a big, big book\\". In a 2009 interview with Oxford University newspaper Cherwell, Pullman stated that The Book of Dust was \\"growing\\" but that he was \\"encountering complexities that seem to be making it longer than I thought it would be.\\" In 2011, Pullman said that he was considering writing The Book of Dust in two volumes, one set before His Dark Materials and the other set afterwards. In September 2012, Pullman told the BBC that The Book of Dust was now his focus and that he had written 220 pages. In December, he told Wired that he had cleared 2013 and most of 2014 to write the book. In May 2016, he said he had vowed to not cut his hair until it was complete. On 14 February 2017, Pullman said that The Book of Dust would be a new trilogy, and announced the publication of the first novel, La Belle Sauvage, published on 19 October 2017. The books are jointly published by Random House Children's and David Fickling Books in the United Kingdom, and by Random House Children's Books in the US.  Books  The Book of Dust takes place before, during and after the original trilogy; Pullman described it as an \\"equel\\", rather than a sequel, which \\"will begin and end with Lyra\\". In Pullman's words the story's main focus is: ‚Äúthe struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organisation, which wants to stifle speculation and enquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free‚Äù. The books will touch on research into Dust, the cosmic matter that governs consciousness. Pullman said the trilogy addresses consciousness: \\"Perhaps the oldest philosophical question of all: are we matter? Or are we spirit and matter? What is consciousness if there is no spirit? Questions like that are of perennial fascination and they haven‚Äôt been solved yet, thank goodness.‚Äù = La Belle Sauvage = The first book, La Belle Sauvage, was published on 19 October 2017. Set around twelve years before the His Dark Materials trilogy, the story follows 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead and his d√¶mon Asta, and a village girl named Alice and her d√¶mon Ben, who become the protectors of the infant Lyra Belacqua and her d√¶mon, Pantalaimon, in Malcolm's canoe, La Belle Sauvage, during a flood. Malcolm forms a friendship with alethiometer specialist Hannah Relf, allied with the secret freedom- seeking organisation Oakley Street, and is drawn into their fight against the growing strength of the Magisterium, which has learned of a prophecy concerning Lyra. Malcolm and Alice are pursued by the maniacal villain Gerard Bonneville, an ally of the Consistorial Court of Discipline (CCD), as they struggle to reach London and Lyra's father Lord Asriel, in order to gain the protection of Jordan College for the baby. = The Secret Commonwealth = The second volume, The Secret Commonwealth, was published on 3 October 2019, and begins with Lyra as a 20-year-old undergraduate. It involves her journeying to the Far East via the Levant. The Secret Commonwealth takes its title from a compilation of folklore by Robert Kirk that Pullman has said is one of his favourite books. =The third book= During a launch event for The Secret Commonwealth in October 2019, Pullman said, \\"We can see where the story is going in this book. It's going towards Central Asia, it involves roses and it involves Dust. That's all I can tell you‚Å†‚ÄîI don't even have a title for it yet!\\" In an interview with Spanish magazine El Templo de las Mil Puertas (The Temple of a Thousand Doors), in April 2018, Pullman had speculated that possible titles included The Garden of Roses or Roses from the South.

Intel 8085, 32KB/64 kb RAM, 2x fdd 80/160 kb, S100 Bus. 2kb monitor ROM, 2kb Video ROM The IMSAI 8080 was an early microcomputer released in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 and later 8085 and S-100 bus. It was a clone of its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800. The IMSAI is largely regarded as the first \\"clone\\" microcomputer. The IMSAI machine ran a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was developed, manufactured and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed IMSAI Manufacturing Corp). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 to 1978.  History  In May 1972, William Millard started businesses individually as IMS Associates (IMS) in the areas of computer consulting and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard founded IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found funding for his business, and received several contracts, all for software. In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a \\"workstation system\\" that could complete jobs for any General Motors car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these workstations were to have common access to a hard disk drive, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had been first introduced, it looked like a \\"real computer\\". Full-scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was put into action using the existing Altair 8800's S-100 bus, and by October 1975 an ad was placed in Popular Electronics, receiving positive reactions. Advertisement: IMSAI 8080 computer with 1K of RAM. $439 kit, $621 assembled. IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on 16 December 1975, before turning to fully assembled units. \\"Later that day, December 16 [1975], United Parcel Service picked up the first shipment of 50 IMS computer kits for delivery to customers.\\" In 1976, IMS was renamed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation because by then, they were a manufacturing company, not a consulting firm. In 1977, IMSAI marketing director Seymour I. Rubinstein paid Gary Kildall $25,000 for the right to run CP/M version 1.3, which eventually evolved into an operating system called IMDOS, on IMSAI 8080 computers. Other manufacturers followed and CP/M eventually became the de facto standard 8-bit operating system. By October 1979, the IMSAI corporation was bankrupt. The 'IMSAI' trademark was acquired by Thomas \\"Todd\\" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues. IMSAI 8080 Floppy disk unit  VDP series  In mid-1977 IMSAI released the VDP-series, based on the Intel 8085. According to the product description of January 1978, many different models were released, with 32K or 64K memory and a 9\\" (VDP4x-range) or 12\\" (VDP8x-range) video display. For example, the VDP-40 had two 5-1/4\\" disk drives, a 9\\" 40-character-wide display and a 2K ROM monitor all in one cabinet. The built-in keyboard had a 8035 microprocessor and a serial interface to the main board. The VIO-C video board had 2K firmware ROM, 2K character generator read-only memory (ROM) with 256 characters and 2K of refresh memory. The VDP80/1050 was listed in January 1978 for $10,920 and the VDP-40/64 for $7,466. IMSAI in popular culture An IMSAI 8080 and an acoustic coupler type modem were among the hacking tools used by the main character in the 1983 movie WarGames. The 2011 novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline features an IMSAI 8080 at the end, being the place where Wade \\"Parzival\\" Watts finds the easter egg that will grant control of the OASIS virtual reality to its finder.

During that period, the rivers were natural borders of the Kingdom of Hungary and Habsburg Monarchy with the Ottoman Empire, part of the Military Frontier. The troops were composed of ethnic Serbs, who had special military status. Their name derives from the small wooden boat known as chaika (≈°ajka, tschaiken), a type of galley. Organization =Personal armament= The ≈†ajka≈°i were armed with sabres, spears and ordinary and mechanical arrows. Sometimes they wore helmets and shields. Their spears likely were longer than ordinary, set to be used at longer distances. They used arrows until the end of the 16th century when the arquebus had been perfected. Later, when gunpowder began to be widely used, the ≈†ajka≈°i were armed with sabres, long spears and muskets. =Warship armament= ;Late 15th and 16th century In 1475, King Matthias had in his Danube Flotilla around 330 chaika with 10,000 men, among which were 1,700 lancers, 1,200 men-at-arms, while \\"the rest were catapultists and crossbowers\\". In the Belgrade port, 34 chaika with 18 oars, 18 soldiers and a catapult at the front were stationed. Larger chaika, of which there were 16, had 24 oars and 300-man-crew, 4 large guns at the front, \\"from which 100-pounds of weight of shots, 100 carbott or pisside (types of shells), and 200 hand-guns, were shot\\". Apart from the ordinary chaika, there were larger ones, called \\"galleys\\". =Clothing= Their clothing was in dark-blue colour. =Ranks= ;Hungary, 16th century *The supreme commanders of ≈†ajka≈°i commands in Hungarian service were called vajd (from vojvoda). These were usually selected ‚Äì retired ≈†ajka≈°i would choose four candidates, of which the captain would choose one for the command. There were instances when the vajd was appointed, but this right, it seems, was only held by the monarch. The vajd stayed in his position until death. The number of vajds was never determined, and it varied depending on the sizes of the ≈†ajka≈°i crews. There were usually 20‚Äì40. In 1521, in Belgrade, there were only 3, while in Varadin 7, and in Slankamen 5. In 1537, there were 17 vajds in Kom√°rom, down to 7 in 1546. The vajd usually served at one place, but there were instances when he was transferred. History =16th century= View of Kom√°rno with chaikas, 1597. Pavle Bakiƒá commanded the ≈†ajka≈°i in the service of Ferdinand, the Archduke of Austria and King of Hungary and Croatia. The ≈†ajka≈°i participated in the Battle of Moh√°cs (1526). After the battle the ≈†ajka≈°i were still unpaid for their services. Ferdinand reprimanded the court for not having paid at least part of the unpaid salary to the ≈†ajka≈°i. Bakiƒá once again turned to Ferdinand, alerting him that the nonpayment to the ≈†ajka≈°i would cause estrangement of the Serbs in his lands, and those of Zapolya and the Ottoman Empire. He also informed Ferdinand of the persecution of Serbs by the Austrian staff and officers. =17th century= From all the writings in Serbian and German by the estimable Archimandrite Jovan Rajiƒá (Johann Raics, 1726-1801), it has been established that the old ≈†ajka≈° Corps had their staff in the city of Komarno (Comorn, Hungarian: Komorom) which is along the upper Danube and that the personnel were under the Hungarian and Polish King Ladislaus III (1424-1444) and those following him until they were included under the rule of Leopold I (1640-1705). The old ≈†ajka≈° Corps was established in 1526 and dissolved in 1746. By far the majority of the ≈†ajka≈°i were Serbs who had come north and west as direct result of the Turkish advance into the Balkans. As Ottoman conquest continued throughout the 1500s, thousands fled north across the Danube into lands vacated by the Serbs, also moving away from the Turks. In addition, thousands of refugees, generally of the Orthodox faith, had entered the largely deserted lands of northern Medieval Serbia where few of the original natives had survived the brutal wars. These Serbs formed the nucleus of the military frontiersmen, beginning in the early 1500s, and of the river fleet, the ≈†ajka≈°i formations. In 1690, a major Serbian immigration took place. Some 30,000 families from Kosovo sought refuge across the Sava and Danube rivers among their kin folk after the Austrian supported revolt failed and left them defenceless in the face of Ottoman reprisals. =18th century= These newly-arrived Serbs together with the members of the earlier ≈†ajka≈°i Corps formed the new ≈†ajka≈°i Battalion on the lower Danube. They defended the border between the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Like the other regiments of the Austrian Military Frontier, the ≈†ajka≈°i settled the deserted borderlands designated for them by the Austrian crown in exchange for military service. The ≈†ajka≈°i battalion's first lower Danube villages were: Titel, Lok, Mo≈°orin (Moschorin), Vilovo (Willova), Gardinovci (Gardinovatz) and ≈Ωabalj (Xablia, formerly Josefdorf). Six more villages were authorized on 7 June 1769: ƒåurug, Gospoƒëinci, ≈†ajka≈° (St. Ivan), Upper Kovilj, Lower Kovilj, and Kaƒá (Kaacs). In 1800 and 1801, two more -- Djurdjevo and Nadalj -- were also settled. On 1 January 1809, the battalion totaled six companies (a division). This battalion, along the model of the other regiments of the Military Frontier, was organized according to the standing order of the Austrian military-civil administration. The duties of and support for the Battalion's frontiersmen were the same as all other frontiersmen. A history of the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion was written between 1842 and 1847 by one of its officers, Captain Jovan Trumiƒá. Apparently the only surviving copy is now at the Serbian scholarly society, Matica srpska, in Novi Sad. The original Trumiƒá manuscript and other documents about the ≈†ajka≈°i were brought to light in 2004 by Slavko Gavriloviƒá, a Serbian scholar who specialized in the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion. Included in Captain Trumiƒá's study are valuable statistics from 1844. There were 30,315 inhabitants on the lands of the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion at that time: 28,656 Serbs; 758 Germans; 528 Hungarians; 196 Wallachians; and 177 others. Within the jurisdiction of the Battalion, there were 28,275 Eastern Orthodox Christians (Non-Uniates, mostly Serbs); 1,627 Roman Catholics (includes Croatians); 329 Protestant Evangelists (Lutherans); 63 Uniates; and 21 Protestant Reformed (Calvenists). Among the additional documents Slavko Gavriloviƒá published in 2004 is a list of the officers who served in the ≈†ajka Battalion between 1762 and 1873. Captain Trumiƒá is among them. A total of 246 Serbian officers are listed. The list is interesting today for the large number of Serbian officers and for the details about their military service which provide information about the officers of both the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion and the Military Frontier. The list is chronological. The dates and places correspond not only to assignments within the Military Frontier but also to postings in far-away wars waged by the Habsburg crown. The list reveals that these officers were transferred to those wars. After 1699, the service of the military frontiersmen was not limited to protecting the Habsburg Empire from the Ottomans. They were required, by regulation, to serve where called. The high command in Vienna viewed the Military Frontier as a vast pool of self-sufficient recruits for the Austrian military, and their participation in the major wars involving the Austrian crown seems to bear this out. =19th Century= By an imperial decree of the Habsburg ruler, Empress Maria Theresa, a special unit of the Austrian Danube Fleet, the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion of the lower Danube, was created in 1763. It was abolished under another Habsburg, Emperor Franz Joseph, in 1872. Of the Battalion's Serbian officers, 89 were promoted from the ranks of non-commissioned officers. Sixty came from several of the Military Frontier's other regiments which were either named for the regimental headquarter cities -- Brod, Gradiska, Ogulin, Otocac, Petrovaradin, Slunj, Titel and Varazdin -- or regions of the Military Frontier -- Banat, Banija, Lika, and Slavonia. Some were cadets or arrived fresh from the Military Frontier School in Vienna. The Trumiƒá list includes the year the officers joined the Battalion and his rank and prior post. Also shown are each officer's promotions and the year he was transferred out of the Battalion as well as his rank and new post. A staggering number military frontiersmen (graniƒçari as they were called in Serbian) from the regiments of the Military Frontier were called up to the Austrian armies engaged in various European wars, such as the Austrian War of Succession (1741-1748); the Seven Years' War (1756-1763); the Bavarian War of Succession (1778-1779); the wars against post-revolutionary France (1792-1800); the Napoleonic Wars (1805-1815); the Austro-Italian Wars (1848-1849, 1859, 1866) and the Revolution of 1848 and the wars against the Hungarians (1848-1849). Postings on the list include places in northern Italy, Mantua and Solferino, made famous in the Napoleonic Wars and in the Austro- Italian Wars. According to the list, Lieutenant Michael Stanisavljeviƒá was transferred to Mantua in 1784 and Captain Marcus Rajƒçeviƒá was killed in the Battle of Solferino in 1859. From the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion, Adjutant George Be≈°anoviƒá transferred to the Bosnian-Serbian Frei Corps in 1788. Lieutenant Gligorije Popoviƒá and Lieutenant Thimotie Zivkoviƒá transferred to Count Gyulay's Frei Corps in 1793. Lieutenant Arsenije Seƒçujac transferred to the 3rd Serbian Frei Crops Battalion in 1813. During the Austro-Turkish War of 1788-1791, the Austrians organized Serbian volunteers into special military force known as the Frei Corps (Free Corps), usually commanded by Austrian officers of Serbian descent. Thirty-five were transferred to other regiments of the Military Frontier. Fifty-one died while in serving in the Battalion, but whether the death was in line of duty is not specified. Seventy-seven retired from the Battalion with pensions. The length of service varied from a few months to as many as 30 years, if not more. Several Serbs became majors, colonels and battalion commanders. In 1763, the year the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion was created, Theodor Stanisavljeviƒá was a Major and the Battalion Commander of the Petrovaradin Frontier Infantry Regiment. In 1773, he was Colonel in the ≈†ajka≈° Battalion. He died in 1783. Colonel Aron Stanisavljeviƒá, in 1813 after 35 years with the Battalion, was promoted to Brigadier General and Major-General and transferred to Banat.That same year, Lieutenant Colonel Johann Nepomuk Majdiƒá became Battalion Commander. In 1816, Captain Thimotie Zivkoviƒá returned to the Battalion and was promoted to Colonel and battalion Commander.In 1835, Colonel Franz Jankovic was appointed Major General and Commander of the Supreme Shipping Office in Vienna. In 1849, Major Johann Bunƒçiƒá was the Battalion Commander of the Ogulin Frontier Regiment and Adjutant to the Austrian-Serbian Army Corps when he joined the Sajkas Battalion. The next year, he was transferred to the Petrovaradin Frontier Infantry Regiment as a Colonel. =≈†ajka≈°i Battalion= The Frontier ≈†ajka≈°i Battalion (Kraji≈°ki ≈°ajka≈°ki bataljon), known in German as Czaikisten-Bataillon, was active in the period of 1763‚Äì1873. After the Treaty of Belgrade (1739) the Habsburg-Ottoman border was set up on the Danube and Sava rivers. The ≈†ajka≈°i bands in Komarno, Esztergom, Gy√∂r and other places were abolished, until the establishment of the ≈†ajka≈°i Battalion in Baƒçka, between the Danube and Tisa, in 1763 upon decision of the Habsburg War Council. The Serb colonising community which was employed into the battalion (the ≈°ajka≈°i) was given the ≈†ajka≈°ka region, which initially included six villages, eventually increased by eight. The battalion headquarters were in Titel. The battalion had four bands in 1769, with ca. 1,116 men, although it was constantly expanded. ≈†ajka≈°i migrations ≈†ajka≈°i families, Serbs, settled in Esztergom during the rule of Matthias Corvinus, a settlement in the lower town developed from the community, called Srpska varo≈°. A group of Serbian ≈†ajka≈°i settled in Slovakia, where they continued their service, known in Slovak as ƒçajk√°ri. Legacy In Hungarian war annals the most clear and also most vulnerable place is taken by the King's ≈†ajka≈°i. They were the most important factors and participants of the victories of the Royal Army. Whenever there was a threat to Hungary, the ≈†ajka≈°i were the main support of the territorial defence and the most reliable aid to the Royal Army. Stationed at many locations, the most important ≈†ajka≈°i units were those of Kom√°rom, as this was the most important Imperial fortress in Hungary; they were stationed here up until the reign of Maria Theresa, when they were moved to South Baƒçka. The ≈°ajkaƒça hat is derived from the 18th-century ≈†ajka≈°i in Banat.

He was born at Diersburg in Baden. He studied theology and philology at Heidelberg and later at Halle under Hermann Hupfeld, who persuaded him to include Arabic, Syriac and Egyptian. Entering the ministry in 1853, he was made vicar at Durlach soon afterwards, and became a licentiate in the theological faculty at Heidelberg. In 1854 he was appointed garrison- preacher at Mannheim for the Evangelical Church in Baden; and in 1858 he was licensed to lecture at Heidelberg, where in 1861 he was made professor extraordinarius. In 1862 he obtained a similar post at Halle, and in 1866 was promoted to the rank of professor ordinarius. As of 1878 he was a member of provincial synod of the Ecclesiastical Province of Saxony within the Evangelical Church of Prussia's older Provinces, advancing to member of the provincial synodal board in 1885, and becoming a member of the old-Prussian general synod too. Throughout his life he followed Hupfeld's plan in his scientific treatment of the Old Testament--that of reconciling the results of a free criticism with a belief in divine revelations. His practical experience of pastoral work also proved of service to him when he became a professor of theology, for if there is one quality more striking than another in the writings of Riehm, it is that of sympathy with orthodox believers (TK Cheyne). In 1865 Riehm was made a member of the commission for the revision of Luther's translation of the Bible, and became one of the editors of the quarterly review, Theologische Studien und Kritiken. His works include: *Die Gesetzgebung Moses im Lande Moab (1854), in which the Deuteronomic law book is assigned to the second half of the reign of Manasseh *Lehrbegriff des Hebr√§erbriefes (1858‚Äì59, 2nd ed. 1867) *Hermann Hupfeld, Lebens-und Charakterbild des deutschen Professors (1867) *Die Messianische Weissagung (1875, 2nd ed. 1883; Eng. trans. 1890) *Religion und Wissenschaft (1881) *the well-known Handw√∂rterbuchs des biblischen Altertums f√ºr gebildete Bibelleser (2 vols., 1884; 2nd. ed. revised by F Baethgen, 1892‚Äì94) After his death were published the Einleitung in das Alte Testament (1889, ed. by A Brandt), in which the date of the Deuteronomic law book is placed earlier than in his book on the legislation of Moses‚Äîshortly before or at the beginning of the reign of Hezekiah; and his Alttestamentliche Theologie (1889, ed. by Pahncke).

It begins at its parent, I-81, in the city's southern end and travels through the eastern Syracuse suburbs of Jamesville, DeWitt, and Cicero before rejoining I-81 in the suburb of North Syracuse. After crossing I-81 in North Syracuse, I-481 continues northwest to Fulton and Oswego as New York State Route 481 (NY 481). I-481 is part of the Veterans Memorial Highway, which extends northward onto NY 481\\\\. Route description I-481 begins at I-81's exit 16A, a directional T interchange in the South Valley section of the city of Syracuse. Immediately crossing under NY 173, I-481 proceeds eastward alongside Rock Cut Road (unsigned County Route 103 or CR 103), which meets the freeway at exit 1 heading east. I-481 crosses out of Syracuse and into the town of Onondaga, paralleling Rock Cut Road into the Clark Reservation State Park. The Interstate Highway makes a bend to the northeast, crossing over tracks used by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and entering exit 2, which connects to Jamesville Road (CR 7). I-481 northbound nearing I-81 in North Syracuse After exit 2, I-481 makes a bend to the north, crossing east of Butternut Creek Golf Course as it crosses into the town of DeWitt. In DeWitt, I-481 enters an interchange (exit 3) with NY 5 and NY 92 (East Genesee Street) just west of the hamlet of Lyndon. After the junction, I-481 continues bending to the northeast, crossing the west end of Old Erie Canal State Park and east of White Chapel Memory Gardens before entering a large interchange with the eastern terminus of I-690. Just north of the interchange, I-481 crosses over NY 290 (Manlius Center Road) and CSX's DeWitt Yard. A short distance after the railroad, I-481 enters exit 5, which connects to Kirkville Road (CR 53). After the interchange with CR 53, I-481 continues northward through DeWitt, paralleling Fly Road (CR 77). A short distance later, I-481 crosses over the New York State Thruway (I-90) and enters exit 6, a trumpet interchange leading to exit 34A of the Thruway. A short distance after the Thruway, I-481 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 298 (Collamer Road). The freeway continues northeast, crossing over East Taft Road (CR 18) in DeWitt before bending northwest into the town of Cicero. In Cicero, I-481 enters an interchange (exit 8) with Northern Boulevard (CR 82). A short distance to the west in the town of North Syracuse, I-481 enters exit 9, a cloverleaf interchange with I-81. At this junction, the designation of I-481 ends while NY 481 continues northwestward toward Oswego. History What is now I-481 was originally proposed as parts of two separate highways bypassing the city of Syracuse. From the New York State Thruway (I-90) in DeWitt southwest to I-81 in the south end of Syracuse, the highway was originally designated as I-281. North of the Thruway, modern I-481 was initially part of \\"Relocated Route 57\\", a proposed limited-access highway extending from NY 57 in Fulton to the Thruway in DeWitt via North Syracuse. All of I-281 and the segment of Relocated Route 57 east of I-81 in North Syracuse were redesignated as I-481 on January 1, 1970. The first section of the highway to be built was the piece between Jamesville Road and NY 5\\\\. Work on this portion of the freeway began and was completed and opened to traffic by 1965. Construction of I-281, and later I-481, initially progressed northward from NY 5\\\\. The segment between Lyndon and I-690 was opened to traffic in the early 1970s, while the piece between I-690 and the Thruway was completed by 1977. To the southwest, the section of I-481 from I-81 to Jamesville Road was finished in the early 1980s, finally connecting I-481 to its parent. The last portion of the route from the Thruway to I-81 in North Syracuse was completed south of NY 298 by 1985 and finished by 1990. Future As part of the demolition and replacement of I-81 through Downtown Syracuse, I-481 will be re-designated as I-81, while the current route of I-81 will be re-designated as Business Route 81. As part of the project, both interchanges between I-81 and I-481 would be reconstructed. The ramps would be expanded to carry more traffic to account for the increased traffic. Also as part of the project, I-481 would be expanded to three lanes each way between exits 4 (I-690) and 5 (Kirkville Road); to three lanes northbound between exits 5 and 6 (I-90); and to three lanes southbound between exits 9 (I-81) and 8 (Northern Boulevard). The project is expected to start in summer 2020 and be completed in five years.

Though severely irradiated, she survived for another ten years, becoming one of the most widely known hibakusha ‚Äì a Japanese term meaning \\"bomb-affected person\\". She is remembered through the story of the one thousand origami cranes she folded before her death, and is to this day a symbol of the innocent victims of nuclear warfare. Event Sadako Sasaki was at home when the explosion occurred, about away from ground zero. She was blown out of the window and her mother ran out to find her, suspecting she may be dead, but instead finding her two-year-old daughter alive with no apparent injuries. While they were fleeing, Sasaki and her mother were caught in black rain. Her grandmother rushed back to the house and was never seen again; later, she was presumed to be dead. =Aftermath= Sadako grew up like her peers and became an important member of her class relay team. In November 1954, Sasaki developed swellings on her neck and behind her ears. In January 1955, purpura had formed on her legs. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with acute malignant lymph gland leukaemia (her mother and others in Hiroshima referred to it as \\"atomic bomb disease\\"). She was hospitalized on 20 February 1955, and given no more than a year to live. Several years after the atomic explosion an increase in leukaemia was observed, especially among children. By the early 1950s, it was clear that the leukaemia was caused by radiation exposure. She was admitted as a patient to the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital for treatment and given blood transfusions on February 21, 1955. By the time she was admitted, her white blood cell count was six times higher compared to the levels of an average child. Origami cranes In August 1955, she was moved into a room with a girl named Kiyo, a junior high school student who was two years older than her. It was shortly after getting this roommate that cranes were brought to her room from a local high school club. Sasaki's father, Shigeo, told her the legend of the cranes and she set herself a goal of folding 1,000 of them, which was believed to grant the folder a wish. Although she had plenty of free time during her days in the hospital, Sasaki lacked paper, so she used medicine wrappings and whatever else she could scrounge; including going to other patients' rooms to ask for the paper from their get-well presents. Her best friend, Chizuko Hamamoto, also brought paper from school for Sasaki to use. A popular version of the story is that Sasaki fell short of her goal of folding 1,000 cranes, having folded only 644 before her death and that her friends completed the 1,000 and buried them all with her. (This comes from the novelized version of her life Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes.) However, an exhibit which appeared in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum stated that by the end of August 1955, Sasaki had achieved her goal and continued to fold 300 more cranes. Sadako's older brother, Masahiro Sasaki, says in his book The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki that she exceeded her goal.The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki (), Masahiro Sasaki, co-written with Sue DiCicco, founder of the Peace Crane Project. Death Sadako Sasaki in her casket During her time in the hospital, her condition progressively worsened. Around mid-October 1955, her left leg became swollen and turned purple. After her family urged her to eat something, Sasaki requested tea on rice and remarked \\"It's tasty\\". She then thanked her family, those being her last words. With her family and friends around her, Sasaki died on the morning of October 25, 1955, at the age of 12. After her death, Sasaki's body was examined by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) for research on the effects of the atomic bomb on the human body. It was later revealed that the ABCC had also conducted tests on Sasaki while she was alive for the same reasons. Memorials After her death, Sasaki's friends and schoolmates published a collection of letters in order to raise funds to build a memorial to her and all of the children who had died from the effects of the atomic bomb, including another Japanese girl Yoko Moriwaki. In 1958, a statue of Sasaki holding a golden crane was unveiled in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. At the foot of the statue is a plaque that reads: \\"This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace in the world.\\" There is also a statue of her in the Seattle Peace Park. Sasaki has become a leading symbol of the effects of nuclear war. Sasaki is also a heroine for many girls in Japan. Her story is told in some Japanese schools on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. Dedicated to Sasaki, people all over Japan celebrate August 6 as the annual peace day. Artist Sue DiCicco founded the Peace Crane Project in 2013 to celebrate Sadako's legacy and connect students around the world in a vision of peace. DiCicco and Sadako's brother co-wrote a book about Sadako, The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki, hoping to bring her true story to English speaking countries. Their website offers a study guide for students and an opportunity to \\"Ask Masahiro\\".

A similar length of land far to the south, together with it and a much longer intermediate lake, altogether forms the Estonia-Russia border. The long lake, mentioned, which the river drains is Lake Peipus. The lake notably drains the much longer Russian river, the Velikaya, and a large, splayed drainage basin in the two countries. The river gives its name to the Narva culture and the city of Narva, which faces the Russian town Ivangorod. At the coast it passes part of the resort of Narva-J√µesuu. Its mouth is specifically into the very open WNW-facing Narva Bay of the Gulf of Finland. It gives the second-greatest discharge into the Gulf of Finland. The greatest discharge is the Neva, ranking fourth as to European rivers. Etymology Fishing competition \\"Narva Salmon 2014\\" The etymology of the toponym Narva is not clear, but according to the most common theory it comes from a Vepsian word narva meaning waterfall or stream. Geography The Narva flows between Hermann Castle and the Ivangorod Fortress The Narva river has its source at the northeastern end of Lake Peipus, near the villages of Vasknarva (Estonia) and Skyamya (Russia). There are a few more small villages on the upper section of the river, for example Permisk√ºla and Kuningak√ºla on the Estonian side and Omuti on the Russian side, but up to the city of Narva the shores of the river are mostly forested or marshy land. The river is dammed entering Narva and Ivangorod, forming the Narva Reservoir, which extends up to upstream. The Narva empties into Narva Bay near the Estonian town of Narva-J√µesuu, third largest settlement on the river after Narva and Ivangorod. The Plyussa is the largest tributary, joining the Narva at the Narva Reservoir from the right. =Waterfall= Joala Falls in spring 2010 Between the southeast part of the city of Narva and the rest, facing the Russian city of Ivangorod, the river flows over the Baltic Klint, forming the Narva Waterfall, at times, as it historically was, the most powerful in Europe. Before the water reaches the falls it is split into two branches by the Kreenholm island, thus the falls consist of two branches. Kreenholm Falls, west of the island, is wide and high with multiple terraces. Joala Falls, to the east, is wide and makes the same descent. The international border follows the latter. Since the creation of Narva Reservoir, an anabranch, in 1955, the falls are usually near-dry, but water is allowed to flow in them for a few days each year. When in flow non-flying viewing access is difficult, being in the border zone and most of the west bank is private, closed industrial land belonging to Krenholm Manufacturing Company. History The Narva was used as a trade route during the Viking Age, from 5th to 11th century. It was an offshoot of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. The Narva has for centuries been an important border river. Beginning in the 13th century it was the border of Medieval Livonia and the Novgorod Republic. Though in earlier periods Narva was part of a larger buffer zone between the two territories, gradually the river emerged as the exact border. Castles built on the river banks (Narva Hermann Castle, founded at the beginning of the 14th century, Ivangorod fortress, established in 1492 and Vasknarva Castle, first built in the 14th century) were one of the main reasons behind this. Treaties from the 15th century between the Livonian Order and Novgorod Republic, later Tsardom of Russia, also recognize the Narva as the border. In XVII century during the time of Swedish Estonia, when Ingria was also part of Sweden, the importance of the river as a border diminished. During the Russian Empire, from the end of the Great Northern War until the establishment of the Republic of Estonia in 1918, the Narva was the border of Governorate of Estonia and Saint Petersburg Governorate, with the exception of the town of Narva, which was part of the latter. By the Treaty of Tartu, signed in 1920, the Estonian‚ÄìRussian border went slightly east of the river, up to , and, in particular, the town of Ivangorod was assigned to Estonia. In 1944 the former Estonian territory east of the river was transferred to Russian SFSR and the Narva was thus established as the eastern border of Estonian SSR, an internal border within USSR. In 1991 the same border became the de facto border of Estonia and Russia. Although no official border treaty has been ratified since then, today the Narva is the eastern border of the European Union and Schengen Zone. =Bridges= Tallinn-St. Petersburg highway bridge The Narva river is crossed only by a handful of bridges between Narva and Ivangorod. Besides the dam of the Narva Reservoir, these are, in downstream order: * a pedestrian bridge below the Kreenholm island * Tallinn‚ÄìSt. Petersburg railway bridge * Tallinn‚ÄìSt. Petersburg highway bridge on E20 just downstream from the Hermann Castle and Ivangorod Fortress.

Early life and education Bonfiglio was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son an orthopedic surgeon, and raised in Iowa City, Iowa. He first began playing the diatonic harmonica when he was thirteen, and although he played in local blues bands as a teenager, had no plans to become a professional musician. He enrolled in the University of Arizona to study chemistry, but at the same time became interested in the possibilities of the chromatic harmonica. After travelling to Trossingen, Germany, in the 1970s where he attended a seminar by the master harmonica player, Cham-Ber Huang, he decided on a musical career. He enrolled in Mannes College of Music in New York City, studying composition. Mannes, like the other major music conservatories in the United States at the time, did not offer majors in the harmonica. However, Bonfiglio also studied the classical harmonica with Cham-Ber Huang for five years and was coached privately by Andrew Loyla, the Principal Flautist with the New York City Ballet orchestra for over ten years. During this time he added all the existing classical music composed for the harmonica to his repertoire.Winzenried, Rebecca (2001). \\"Robert Bonfiglio: Hummin'\\". The Free- Reed Journal.

After receiving his Bachelor of Music from Mannes, Bonfiglio went to post-graduate study at the Manhattan School of Music. It was his composition teacher there, Charles Wuorinen, who told him he could do more with the classical harmonica than with composition because it was such a special niche. Career After graduating from the Manhattan School of Music with his Masters in Music, Bonfiglio supported himself as a session musician in New York working on commercials and soundtracks for television programs and films, including the soundtracks for Kramer vs. Kramer and Places in the Heart. His breakthrough as a concert artist came in 1986 when he performed the world premiere of Henry Cowell's Harmonica Concerto with the Brooklyn Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lukas Foss.

This term presumably came from RAF minelaying missions, or \\"gardening\\" sorties. \\"Gardening\\" was standard RAF slang for sowing mines in rivers, ports and oceans from low heights, possibly because each sea area around the European coasts was given a code- name of flowers or vegetables.90 Squadron The technique is claimed to have been most effective against messages produced by the German Navy's Enigma machines. If the Germans had recently swept a particular area for mines, and analysts at Bletchley Park were in need of some cribs, they might (and apparently did on several occasions) request that the area be mined again. This would hopefully evoke encrypted messages from the local command mentioning Minen (German for mines) and/or the location, and perhaps messages also from the headquarters with minesweeping ships to assign to that location, mentioning the same. It worked often enough to try several times.

A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with TSC2 mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many. The prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 7 to 12 in 100,000. The disease is often abbreviated to tuberous sclerosis, which refers to the hard swellings in the brains of patients, first described by French neurologist D√©sir√©- Magloire Bourneville in 1880.  Signs and symptoms  The physical manifestations of TSC are due to the formation of hamartia (malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers), hamartomas (benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules), and very rarely, cancerous hamartoblastomas. The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral problems. =Neurological= TSC in MRI Three types of brain tumours are associated with TSC: * Giant cell astrocytoma: (grows and blocks the cerebrospinal fluid flow, leading to dilatation of ventricles causing headache and vomiting) * Cortical tubers: after which the disease is named * Subependymal nodules: form in the walls of ventricles Classic intracranial manifestations of TSC include subependymal nodules and cortical/subcortical tubers. The tubers are typically triangular in configuration, with the apex pointed towards the ventricles, and are thought to represent foci of abnormal neuronal migration. The T2 signal abnormalities may subside in adulthood, but will still be visible on histopathological analysis. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TSC patients can exhibit other signs consistent with abnormal neuron migration such as radial white matter tracts hyperintense on T2WI and heterotopic gray matter. Subependymal nodules are composed of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules have a tendency to calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus. A variable degree of ventricular enlargement is seen, either obstructive (e.g. by a subependymal nodule in the region of the foramen of Monro) or idiopathic in nature. = Neuropsychiatric = About 90% of people with TSC develop a range of neurodevelopmental, behavioural, psychiatric, and psychosocial difficulties. The \\"TSC‚Äêassociated neuropsychiatric disorders\\" are abbreviated TAND. These difficulties are less frequently identified and thus undertreated when compared with the neurological symptoms. Most problems are associated with more severe intellectual delay or associated with childhood and adolescence, and some (for example depressed mood) may be unreported if the person is unable to communicate. TAND can be investigated and considered at six levels: behavioural, psychiatric, intellectual, academic, neuropsychological, and psychosocial. Behavioural problems most commonly seen include overactivity, impulsivity and sleeping difficulties. Also common are anxiety, mood swings, and severe aggression. Less common are depressed mood, self-injury, and obsessional behaviours. People with TSC are frequently also diagnosed psychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and depressive disorder. TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder, which affects nearly half of people with TSC. ASD is more common in TSC2 than TSC1 and more common with earlier and more severe epilepsy, and with lower intellectual ability. ADHD is nearly as frequently seen in TSC as ASD (up to half of all people with TSC). Anxiety and depressive disorders, when they occur, are typically diagnosed in early adulthood and among those intellectually able to express their moods. Schizophrenia (and symptoms like hallucinations or psychosis) is no more common in TSC than the general population. The intellectual ability of people with TSC varies enormously. About 40‚Äì50% have a normal IQ. A normal IQ is much more commonly seen in TSC1 than TSC2, and profound intellectual disability seen in 34% of TSC2 compared with 10% of TSC1 in one study. Many studies have examined whether early onset, type and severity of epilepsy associates with intellectual ability. Academic issues occur even in people with TSC who have normal intellectual ability. These are often specific learning disorders such as dyscalculia (understanding mathematics), but also include other aspects affecting school life such as anxiety, lack of social skills or low self-esteem. About half of people with TSC, when assessed for neuropsychological skills, are in the bottom 5th percentile in some areas, which indicates a severe impairment. These include problems with attention (for example, being able to concentrate on two separate things like looking and listening), memory (particularly recall, verbal and spatial working memory) and executive function (for example, planning, self-monitoring, cognitive flexibility). The psychosocial impacts of TSC include low self-esteem and self-efficacy in the individual, and a burden on the family coping with a complex and unpredictable disorder. = Kidneys = Computed tomography showing multiple angiomyolipomas of the kidney in a patient with lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis on CT: suspected TSC Between 60 and 80% of TSC patients have benign tumors (once thought hamartomatous, but now considered true neoplasms) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas frequently causing hematuria. These tumors are composed of vascular (angio‚Äì), smooth muscle (‚Äìmyo‚Äì), and fat (‚Äìlip-) tissue. Although benign, an angiomyolipoma larger than 4 cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage either spontaneously or with minimal trauma. Angiomyolipomas are found in about one in 300 people without TSC. However, those are usually solitary, whereas in TSC they are commonly multiple and bilateral. About 20-30% of people with TSC have renal cysts, causing few problems. However, 2% may also have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Very rare (< 1%) problems include renal cell carcinoma and oncocytomas (benign adenomatous hamartoma). = Lungs = Patients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts, known as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Recent genetic analysis has shown that the proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle in TSC- related lymphangioleiomyomatosis is monoclonal metastasis from a coexisting renal angiomyolipoma. Cases of TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis recurring following lung transplant have been reported. = Heart = Small tumours of the heart muscle, called cardiac rhabdomyomas, are rare in the general population (perhaps 0.2% of children) but very common in people with TSC. Around 80% of children under two-years-old with TSC have at least one rhabdomyoma, and about 90% of those will have several. The vast majority of children with at least one rhabdomyoma, and nearly all children with multiple rhabdomyomas will be found to have TSC. Prenatal ultrasound, performed by an obstetric sonographer specializing in cardiology, can detect a rhabdomyoma after 20 weeks. Rhabdomyoma vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres, and are usually found in the lower chambers (ventricles) and less often in the upper chambers (atria). They grow in size during the second half of pregnancy, but regress after birth, and are seen in only around 20% of children over two years old. Most rhabdomyomas cause no problems but some may cause heart failure in the foetus or first year of life. Rhabdomyomas are believed to be responsible for the development of heart arrhythmia later in life, which is relatively common in TSC. Arrhythmia can be hard to spot in people with TSC, other than by performing routine ECG. For example, arrhythmia may cause fainting that is confused with drop seizures, and symptoms of arrhythmia such as palpitations may not be reported in an individual with developmental delay. = Skin = Some form of dermatological sign is present in 96% of individuals with TSC. Most cause no problems, but are helpful in diagnosis. Some cases may cause disfigurement, necessitating treatment. The most common skin abnormalities include: * Hypomelanic macules (\\"ash leaf spots\\") are present in about 90% of people with TSC. These small white or lighter patches of skin may appear anywhere on the body, and are caused by a lack of melanin. They are usually the only visible sign of TSC at birth. In fair-skinned individuals, a Wood's lamp (ultraviolet light) may be required to see them. On the scalp, the effect may be a white patch of hair (poliosis). Patches smaller than 3mm are known as \\"confetti\\" skin lesions. * Facial angiofibromas are present in about 75% of people with TSC. These are a rash of reddish spots or bumps on the nose and cheeks in a butterfly distribution, which consist of blood vessels and fibrous tissue. This potentially socially embarrassing rash starts to appear during childhood. * Ungual fibromas: Also known as Koenen's tumors, these are small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails. These are rare in childhood, but common by middle age. They are generally more common on toes than on fingers, develop at 15‚Äì29 years, and are more common in women than in men. * Fibrous cephalic plaques are present in about 25% of people with TSC. These are raised, discoloured areas usually found on the forehead, but sometimes on the face or elsewhere on the scalp. * Shagreen patches are present in about half of people with TSC, appearing in childhood. They are areas of thick leathery skin that are dimpled like an orange peel, and pigmented, they are usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck, or scattered across the trunk or thighs. The frequency of these lesions rises with age. * Dental enamel pits are found in almost all adults with TSC. * Intraoral fibromas are small surface-tumours found in the gums, inside the cheeks or tongue. Gum (gingival) fibromas are found in about 20-50% of people with TSC, more commonly in adults. = Eyes = Retinal lesions, called astrocytic hamartomas (or \\"phakomas\\"), which appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on the ophthalmic examination. Astrocytic hamartomas can calcify, and they are in the differential diagnosis of a calcified globe mass on a CT scan. Nonretinal lesions associated with TSC include: * Coloboma * Angiofibromas of the eyelids * Papilledema (related to hydrocephalus) = Pancreas = Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours have been described in rare cases of TSC. = Variability = Individuals with TSC may experience none or all of the clinical signs discussed above. The following table shows the prevalence of some of the clinical signs in individuals diagnosed with TSC. The frequency of signs in children with TSC, grouped by age  Genetics  TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. TSC is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. Two-thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in roughly 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far, it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2. TSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34, and was discovered in 1997. TSC2 encodes for the protein tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3, and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop polycystic kidney disease in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC. However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically. Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by TSC2 range from 55% to 90%. TSC1 and TSC2 are both tumor suppressor genes that function according to Knudson's \\"two hit\\" hypothesis. That is, a second random mutation must occur before a tumor can develop. This explains why, despite its high penetrance, TSC has wide expressivity.  Pathophysiology  Hamartin and tuberin function as a complex which is involved in the control of cell growth and cell division. The complex appears to interact with RHEB GTPase, thus sequestering it from activating mTOR signalling, part of the growth factor (insulin) signalling pathway. Thus, mutations at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci result in a loss of control of cell growth and cell division, and therefore a predisposition to forming tumors. TSC affects tissues from different germ layers. Cutaneous and visceral lesions may occur, including angiofibroma, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and renal angiomyolipomas. The central nervous system lesions seen in this disorder include hamartomas of the cortex, hamartomas of the ventricular walls, and subependymal giant cell tumors, which typically develop in the vicinity of the foramina of Monro. Molecular genetic studies have defined at least two loci for TSC. In TSC1, the abnormality is localized on chromosome 9q34, but the nature of the gene protein, called hamartin, remains unclear. No missense mutations occur in TSC1. In TSC2, the gene abnormalities are on chromosome 16p13. This gene encodes tuberin, a guanosine triphosphatase‚Äìactivating protein. The specific function of this protein is unknown. In TSC2, all types of mutations have been reported; new mutations occur frequently. Few differences have yet been observed in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or the other. Cells from individuals with pathogenic mutations in the TSC2 gene display abnormal accumulation of glycogen that is associated with depletion of lysosomes and autophagic impairment. The defective degradation of glycogen by the autophagy-lysosome pathway is, at least in part, independent of impaired regulation of mTORC1 and is restored, in cultured cells, by the combined use of PKB/Akt and mTORC1 pharmacological inhibitors.  Diagnosis  Tuberous sclerosis complex is diagnosed with clinical and genetic tests. There are many different mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that have been identified in individuals with TSC. A pathogenic mutation in the gene prevents the proteins from being made or inactivates the proteins. If such a pathogenic mutation is found then this alone is sufficient to diagnose TSC. However, some mutations are less clear in their effect, and so not sufficient alone for diagnosis. Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4 of individuals with TSC have no mutation that can be identified. Once a particular mutation is identified in someone with TSC, this mutation can be used to make confident diagnoses in other family members. For clinical diagnosis, there isn't one sign that is unique (pathognomonic) to TSC, nor are all signs seen in all individuals. Therefore, several signs are considered together, classed as either major or minor features. An individual with two major features, or one major feature and at least two minor features can be given a definite diagnosis of TSC. If only one major feature or at least two minor features are present, the diagnosis is only regarded as possibly TSC. { class=wikitable width=\\"75%\\" style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" + Diagnostic Criteria for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ! colspan=\\"5\\" width=\\"100%\\"  Major Features - ! width=\\"2%\\"  ! width=\\"12%\\"  Location ! width=\\"42%\\"  Sign ! width=\\"22%\\"  Onset ! width=\\"22%\\"  Note - ! 1  Skin  Hypomelanotic macules  Infant ‚Äì child  At least three, at least 5 mm in diameter. - ! 2  Head  Facial angiofibromas or fibrous cephalic plaque  Infant ‚Äì adult  At least three angiofibromas - ! 3  Fingers and toes  Ungual fibroma  Adolescent ‚Äì adult  At least two - ! 4  Skin  Shagreen patch (connective tissue nevus)  Child  - ! 5  Eyes  Multiple retinal nodular hamartomas  Infant  - ! 6  Brain  Cortical dysplasias (includes tubers and cerebral white matter radial migration lines)  Fetus  - ! 7  Brain  Subependymal nodule  Child ‚Äì adolescent  - ! 8  Brain  Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma  Child ‚Äì adolescent  - ! 9  Heart  Cardiac rhabdomyoma  Fetus  - ! 10  Lungs  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis  Adolescent ‚Äì adult  - ! 11  Kidneys  Renal angiomyolipoma  Child ‚Äì adult  At least two.

Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chance if heart tumours are discovered during routine ultrasound. In infancy, epilepsy, particularly infantile spasms, or developmental delay may lead to neurological tests. The white patches on the skin may also first become noticed. In childhood, behavioural problems and autism spectrum disorder may provoke a diagnosis. During adolescence, the skin problems appear. In adulthood, kidney and lung problems may develop. An individual may also be diagnosed at any time as a result of genetic testing of family members of another affected person.  Management  Tuberous sclerosis complex affects multiple organ systems so a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals is required. In suspected or newly diagnosed TSC, the following tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference. * Take a personal and family history covering three generations. Genetic counselling and tests determine if other individuals are at risk. * A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to identify tubers, subependymal nodules (SEN) and sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA). * Children undergo a baseline electroencephalograph (EEG) and family educated to identify seizures if/when they occur. * Assess children for behavioural issues, autism spectrum disorder, psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, and neuropsychological problems. * Scan the abdomen for tumours in various organs, but most importantly angiomyolipomata in the kidneys. MRI is superior to CT or ultrasound. Take blood pressure and test renal function. * In adult women, test pulmonary function and perform a high- resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. * Examine the skin under a Wood's lamp (hypomelanotic macules), the fingers and toes (ungual fibroma), the face (angiofibromas), and the mouth (dental pits and gingival fibromas). * In infants under three, perform an echocardiogram to spot rhabdomyomas, and electrocardiogram (ECG) for any arrhythmia. * Use a fundoscope to spot retinal hamartomas or achromic patches. The various symptoms and complications from TSC may appear throughout life, requiring continued surveillance and adjustment to treatments. The following ongoing tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference. * In children and adults younger than 25 years, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is performed every one to three years to monitor for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). If a SEGA is large, growing or interfering with ventricles, the MRI is performed more frequently. After 25 years, if there are no SEGAs then periodic scans may no longer be required. A SEGA causing acute symptoms are removed with surgery, otherwise either surgery or drug treatment with an mTOR inhibitor may be indicated. * Repeat screening for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) at least annually. Sudden behavioural changes may indicate a new physical problem (for example with the kidneys, epilepsy or a SEGA). * Routine EEG determined by clinical need. * Infantile spasms are best treated with vigabatrin and adrenocorticotropic hormone used as a second-line therapy. Other seizure types have no TSC-specific recommendation, though epilepsy in TSC is typically difficult to treat (medically refractory). * Repeat MRI of abdomen every one to three years throughout life. Check renal (kidney) function annually. Should angiomyolipoma bleed, this is best treated with embolisation and then corticosteroids. Removal of the kidney (nephrectomy) is strongly to be avoided. An asymptomatic angiomyolipoma that is growing larger than 3 cm is best treated with an mTOR inhibitor drug. Other renal complications spotted by imaging include polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma. * Repeat chest HRCT in adult women every five to 10 years. Evidence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) indicates more frequent testing. An mTOR inhibitor drug can help, though a lung transplant may be required. * A 12-lead ECG should be performed every three to five years. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus was approved in the US for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012. Oral everolimus (rapalog) reduces tumour size, is effective in terms of response to skin lesions and does not increase the risk of adverse events. Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC. In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC. Neurosurgical intervention may reduce the severity and frequency of seizures in TSC patients. Embolization and other surgical interventions can be used to treat renal angiomyolipoma with acute hemorrhage. Surgical treatments for symptoms of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in adult TSC patients include pleurodesis to prevent pneumothorax and lung transplantation in the case of irreversible lung failure. Other treatments that have been used to treat TSC manifestations and symptoms include a ketogenic diet for intractable epilepsy and pulmonary rehabilitation for LAM. Facial angiofibromas can be reduced with laser treatment and the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitor topical treatment is being investigated. Laser therapy is painful, requires anaesthesia, and has risks of scarring and dyspigmentation.  Prognosis  The prognosis for individuals with TSC depends on the severity of symptoms, which range from mild skin abnormalities to varying degrees of learning disabilities and epilepsy to severe intellectual disability, uncontrollable seizures, and kidney failure. Those individuals with mild symptoms generally do well and live long, productive lives, while individuals with the more severe form may have serious disabilities. However, with appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy. A study of 30 TSC patients in Egypt found, \\"...earlier age of seizures commencement (<6 months) is associated with poor seizure outcome and poor intellectual capabilities. Infantile spasms and severely epileptogenic EEG patterns are related to the poor seizure outcome, poor intellectual capabilities and autistic behavior. Higher tubers numbers is associated with poor seizure outcome and autistic behavior. Left-sided tuber burden is associated with poor intellect, while frontal location is more encountered in ASD [autism spectrum disorders]. So, close follow up for the mental development and early control of seizures are recommended in a trial to reduce the risk factors of poor outcome. Also early diagnosis of autism will allow for earlier treatment and the potential for better outcome for children with TSC.\\" Leading causes of death include renal disease, brain tumour, lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the lung, and status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia in those with severe mental handicap. Cardiac failure due to rhabdomyomas is a risk in the fetus or neonate but is rarely a problem subsequently. Kidney complications such as angiomyolipoma and cysts are common and more frequent in females than males and in TSC2 than TSC1. Renal cell carcinoma is uncommon. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is only a risk for females with angiomyolipomas. In the brain, the subependymal nodules occasionally degenerate to subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. These may block the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain, leading to hydrocephalus. Detection of the disease should be followed by genetic counselling. It is also important to realise that though the disease does not have a cure, symptoms can be treated symptomatically. Hence, awareness regarding different organ manifestations of TSC is important.  Epidemiology  TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders. The live-birth prevalence is estimated to be between 10 and 16 cases per 100,000. A 1998 study estimated total population prevalence between about 7 and 12 cases per 100,000, with more than half of these cases undetected. Prior to the invention of CT scanning to identify the nodules and tubers in the brain, the prevalence was thought to be much lower, and the disease associated with those people diagnosed clinically with learning disability, seizures and facial angiofibroma. Whilst still regarded as a rare disease, TSC is common when compared to many other genetic diseases, with at least 1 million individuals affected worldwide.  History  D√©sir√©-Magloire Bourneville TSC first came to medical attention when dermatologists described the distinctive facial rash (1835 and 1850). A more complete case was presented by von Recklinghausen (1862), who identified heart and brain tumours in a newborn who had only briefly lived. However, Bourneville (1880) is credited with having first characterized the disease, coining the name \\"tuberous sclerosis\\", thus earning the eponym Bourneville's disease. The neurologist Vogt (1908) established a diagnostic triad of epilepsy, idiocy, and adenoma sebaceum (an obsolete term for facial angiofibroma). Symptoms were periodically added to the clinical picture. The disease as presently understood was first fully described by Gomez (1979). The invention of medical ultrasound, CT and MRI has allowed physicians to examine the internal organs of live patients and greatly improved diagnostic ability. In 2002, treatment with rapamycin was found to be effective at shrinking tumours in animals. This has led to human trials of rapamycin as a drug to treat several of the tumors associated with TSC.

Caproni, also known as Societ√† de Agostini e Caproni and Societ√† Caproni e Comitti, was an Italian aircraft manufacturer. Its main base of operations was at Taliedo, near Linate Airport, on the outskirts of Milan. Founded by Giovanni Battista \\"Gianni\\" Caproni during 1908, the company produced several successful heavy bombers during the First World War. Following the acquisition of several other aviation firms throughout the interwar period, Caproni transformed into a sizable aviation- orientated syndicate, the Societ√† Italiana Caproni, Milano. The majority of its aircraft were bombers and transport aircraft. It played a pioneering role in the development of the Caproni Campini N.1, an experimental aircraft powered by a thermo-jet. It provided large numbers of combat aircraft for the Axis during the Second World War. The firm did not prosper in the postwar era, the Societ√† Italiana Caproni collapsing during 1950. Many of the company's former assets were subsequently acquired by the Italian helicopter specialist Agusta. History The company was founded during 1908 by the Italian aviation pioneer and aeronautical engineer Giovanni Battista \\"Gianni\\" Caproni. It was initially named, from 1911, Societ√† de Agostini e Caproni, then Societ√† Caproni e Comitti. Caproni was responsible for completing the first aircraft of Italian construction in 1911. Its principal manufacturing facilities were based in Taliedo, a peripheral district of Milan, close to Linate Airport, while the firm's Caproni Vizzola division was based in Vizzola Ticino, close to Milan‚ÄìMalpensa Airport. The firm initially produced a series of small single-engine aircraft, including the Caproni Ca.1, Ca.6 and Ca.12; these became important milestones in the early development of Italian aviation. As such, Caproni became one of the most important Allied aircraft manufacturers during the First World War, being responsible for the design and manufacture of large, multi-engine long-range bombers, such as the three-engined Caproni Ca.32, Ca.33, Ca.36 and Ca.40. These aircraft were adopted not only by the Italian military, but by the French, British and American air services as well. Caproni's bombers have been regarded as being some of the most significant examples of the period in the field of heavy aircraft. Following the end of the conflict, the strategic bombing theories of Giulio Douhet were reputedly shaped by the operational use of Caproni bombers, and thus have been was seen as an important landmark in the history of aviation. The Interwar period was a busy one for Caproni. It reorganised itself into a large syndicate, named the Societ√† Italiana Caproni, Milano, having acquired several smaller Italian manufacturers. By the 1930s, the company's main subdivisions comprised Caproni Bergamasca, Caproni Vizzola, Reggiane and the engine manufacturer Isotta Fraschini. Caproni's aircraft activity largely orientated towards the production of bombers and light transport aircraft. During 1927, the Caproni Museum (Italian: Museo Caproni) was established in Taliedo by Giovanni Caproni and his wife, Timina Caproni. It is both the oldest aviation museum in Italy, as well as well as the country's oldest corporate museum. The Caproni Museum has long outlived the Caproni company itself.\\"Museums\\" (in English). UNITN - Scienze Matematiche, Fisiche e Naturali, 2012. Retrieved 14 April 2012. The Caproni Campini N.1 overflying Piazza Venezia, Rome During the 1930s, Caproni became involved with the Italian aeronautics engineer Secondo Campini, who was engaged in pioneering research in the then-unexplored field of jet propulsion, having proposed adopting a so-called thermo-jet to power an aircraft.Golly 1996, pp. 32‚Äì33. Campini had been issued with an initial contract from the Italian government to develop and manufacture his envisioned engine. During 1934, the Regia Aeronautica (the Italian Air Force) granted its approval to proceed with the production of a pair of jet-powered prototype aircraft; Caproni was engaged to manufacture this aircraft, which was thus designated as the Caproni Campini N.1, with Campini providing technical guidance while specialising in the engine's design.Pavelec 2007, p. 5. On 27 August 1940, the maiden flight of the experimental N.1 occurred at Caproni's Taliedo facility.\\"Italian Air Scooter\\". Flight, 10 October 1952. p. 471. On 30 November 1941, the second prototype was flown from Milan's Linate Airport to Rome's Guidonia Airport, in a highly publicised event that included a fly-past over Rome and a reception with Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. According to the historian Nathanial Edwards, the practicality of the N.1 design had been undermined by political pressure to speed the programme along so that Italy would be more likely to be the first country in the world to perform a jet-powered flight.Edwards, Nathanial. \\"Flight as Propaganda in Fascist Italy.\\" World At War Magazine, Late 2010. According to economics author Harrison Mark, Soviet aircraft design bureau TsAGI obtained details on the N.1 programme and were encouraged to pursue work on a similar design; as such, there is a basis for stating that the design of the N.1 influenced subsequent early jet aircraft.Mark 2014, p. 235. The early years of the postwar era was one of considerable hardship for Caproni and the wider Italian aviation industry alike. During 1950, the Societ√† Italiana Caproni ceased to exist. However, one of the company's former divisions, Caproni Vizzola, endured until 1983, at which point it was acquired by the Italian helicopter manufacturer Agusta.

Kuenen was born in Haarlem, the son of an apothecary. On his father's death it became necessary for him to leave school and take a humble place in the business. By the generosity of friends he was educated at the gymnasium at Haarlem and afterwards at the University of Leiden. He studied theology, and won his doctor's degree by an edition of thirty-four chapters of Genesis from the Arabic version of the Samaritan Pentateuch. In 1853 he became professor extraordinarius of theology at Leiden, and in 1855 full professor. He married a daughter of Willem Muurling, one of the founders of the Groningen school, which made the first pronounced breach with Calvinistic theology in the Reformed Church of the Netherlands. Kuenen himself soon became one of the main supporters of the modern theology, of which JH Scholten and Karel Willem Opzoomer (b. 1821) were the chief founders, and of which Leiden became the headquarters. His first great work, an historico-critical introduction to the Old Testament, Historisch-Kritisch Onderzoek naar het onstaan en de verzameling van de Boeken des Ouden Verbonds (3 vols., 1861-1865; 2nd ed., 1885-1893; German by T Weber and CT M√ºller, 1885-1894), followed the lines of this dominant school of Heinrich Ewald. But before long he came under the influence of J.W. Colenso, and learned to regard the prophetic narrative of Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers as older than what was by the Germans denominated Grundschrift (Book of Origins). In 1869-1870 he published his book on the religion of Israel, De Godsdienst van Isra√´l tot den ondergang van den Joodschen staat (3 vols.; Eng. trans., 1874-1875). This was followed in 1875 by a study of Hebrew prophecy, De profeten en de profetie onder Israel (Eng. trans., 1877), largely polemical in its scope, and specially directed against those who rest theological dogmas on the fulfilment of prophecy. In 1882 Kuenen went to England to deliver a course of Hibbert lectures, National Religions and Universal Religion; in the following year he presided at the congress of Orientalists held at Leiden. In 1886 his volume on the Hexateuch was published in England. He died at Leiden on December 10, 1891. Kuenen was also the author of many articles, papers and reviews; a series on the Hexateuch, which appeared in the Theologisch Tijdschrift, of which in 1866 he became joint editor, is one of the finest products of modern criticism. His collected works were translated into German and published by Karl Budde in 1894. Several of his works have been translated into English by Philip Wicksteed.

Bruggink (editor), (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1987), 102. From Franeker in 1843 he went to Leiden as professor extraordinarius, and in 1845 was promoted to the rank of ordinarius. Through Scholten, Abraham Kuenen became interested in theology; Scholten was not then the radical theologian he became later. The two scholars in course of time created a movement resembling that of the T√ºbingen School in Germany. From his theology there \\"began to rise a different type of spirit, the spirit of absolute antisupernaturalism of the German idealistic kind.\\" Pursuing first the study of dogmatic theology and the philosophy of religion, Scholten published a work on the Principles of the Theology of the Reformed Church (2 vols, 1848‚Äì1850, 4th ed. 1861‚Äì1862). He then gave special attention to the New Testament, and wrote A Critical Study of the Gospel of John (1864, in German 1867). Scholten's other works include: *Historical and Critical Introduction to the New Testament (1853‚Äì1856) *The Oldest Witnesses to the Writings of the New Testament (1866) *The Oldest Gospel (1868) *The Pauline Gospel (1870) *A Comparative View of Religions An account of his theological development is given in Afscheidsrede bij het Neerleggen van het Hoogleeraarsambt (1881), and in the biography written by A Kuenen, Levensbericht van J. Henricus Scholten (1885). He became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856.

Properties and examples Any Hausdorff (T2) space is sober (the only irreducible subsets being points), and all sober spaces are Kolmogorov (T0), and both implications are strict. Sobriety is not comparable to the T1 condition: an example of a T1 space which is not sober is an infinite set with the cofinite topology, the whole space being an irreducible closed subset with no generic point. Moreover T2 is stronger than T1 and sober, i.e., while every T2 space is at once T1 and sober, there exist spaces that are simultaneously T1 and sober, but not T2. One such example is the following: let X be the set of real numbers, with a new point p adjoined; the open sets being all real open sets, and all cofinite sets containing p. Sobriety of X is precisely a condition that forces the lattice of open subsets of X to determine X up to homeomorphism, which is relevant to pointless topology. Sobriety makes the specialization preorder a directed complete partial order. The prime spectrum Spec(R) of a commutative ring R with the Zariski topology is a compact sober space. In fact, every spectral space (i.e. a compact sober space for which the collection of compact open subsets is closed under finite intersections and forms a base for the topology) is homeomorphic to Spec(R) for some commutative ring R. This is a theorem of Melvin Hochster. More generally, the underlying topological space of any scheme is a sober space. The subset of Spec(R) consisting only of the maximal ideals, where R is a commutative ring, is not sober in general.

Paul Flaherty directed the film, which co-stars Annie Potts, Jeffrey Jones and Shawnee Smith. An uncredited cameo appearance is made by Jim Belushi. The story concerns the often incompetent, sometimes brilliant, private investigator Harry Crumb, who searches for a kidnapping victim. Plot While visiting a health studio in Beverly Hills, fashion model Jennifer Downing, the daughter of millionaire P.J. Downing, is kidnapped. Her father turns to a family friend, Eliot Draisen, who is president of the detective agency Crumb & Crumb, to investigate the case. Eliot is reluctant to supply P.J. with one of his capable detectives because, as it turns out, Eliot himself is the organizer of the kidnapping. To give the appearance of taking the investigation seriously, Eliot offers P.J. the services of Harry Crumb, the last descendant of the agency's founders. Eliot knows that Harry is incompetent and counts on this fact to get away with the crime. Harry returns to Los Angeles (by bus) from an assignment in the firm's Tulsa, Oklahoma branch office (which he messed up, as usual). He is assisted in his investigation by P.J.'s younger daughter, Nikki, who is considerably smarter than he is. Harry deduces that Nikki's stepmother, Helen Downing, is having an affair with tennis coach Vince Barnes, and concludes she is behind the kidnapping. Helen is desired by Eliot, but all she is interested in is money. She tries to get rid of her husband on several occasions and does her best - along with Barnes - to get the ransom for herself. Also assigned to the case is Police Detective Casey, who (unlike Harry) is competent and experienced in kidnapping cases, and has a strongly negative opinion of private eyes. Eliot escapes to the airport, bound for Buenos Aires. He makes the mistake of informing Helen of his plans; she and Barnes take the money and leave him bound and gagged. Harry arrives to confront Helen and Barnes just as their plane prepares to take off. Jennifer is freed and Eliot is found. Falsely believing Harry has deduced his part in the kidnapping and exasperated with Harry's dumb luck, Eliot confesses and is taken into police custody. Harry is thanked for his heroism in the case and even Det. Casey applauds Harry for solving the case. In the end, Harry takes over as the new president of his family's business, and promptly accepts a new assignment to investigate another case, this time a murder committed in a gay bar.

(1996) Siren Feasts, London, p. 151, this cup shows Hecamede mixing kykeon for Nestor. Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup, c. 490 BC. From Vulci. Nestor of Gerenia (, Nest≈çr Gerƒìnios) was the legendary wise King of Pylos described in Homer's Odyssey.Homer, Odyssey XVII 108-112 Excavations from 1939 revealed his palace, and excavations have recently resumed at the site.  Family  Nestor was the son of Neleus and Chloris. His wife was either Eurydice or Anaxibia; their children included Peisistratus, Thrasymedes, Pisidice, Polycaste, Perseus, Stratichus, Aretus, Echephron, and Antilochus. In late accounts, Nestor had a daughter Epicaste who became the mother of Homer by Telemachus.\\"Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica\\" (Contest of Homer and Hesiod)  Reference in texts  Nestor is referred to in the play The Merchant of Venice, in Scene 1 of Act I, as a person who would laugh only at a very serious joke. Nestor is also a character in William Shakespeare's play Troilus and Cressida, set during the Trojan War. Mythology = Adventures = Originally from Gerenia, Nestor was an Argonaut, helped fight the centaurs, and participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. He became the King of Pylos after Heracles killed Neleus and all of Nestor's siblings. He and his sons, Antilochus and Thrasymedes, fought on the side of the Achaeans in the Trojan War. Though Nestor was already very old when the war began, he was noted for his bravery and speaking abilities. In the Iliad, he often gives advice to the younger warriors and advises Agamemnon and Achilles to reconcile. He is too old to engage in combat himself, but he leads the Pylian troops, riding his chariot, and one of his horses is killed by an arrow shot by Paris. He also had a solid gold shield. Homer frequently calls him by the epithet \\"the Gerenian horseman.\\" At the funeral games of Patroclus, Nestor advises Antilochus on how to win the chariot race. Antilochus was later killed in battle by Memnon. In the Odyssey, Nestor and those who were part of his army had safely returned to Pylos, having chosen to leave Troy immediately after plundering the city rather than staying behind with Agamemnon to appease Athena, who was angered by the heinous actions of some of the Greeks (probably Ajax the Lesser). Odyssey Book III.140-170 Odysseus's son Telemachus travels to Pylos to inquire about the fate of his father. Nestor receives his friend's son,\\"... In Book 3 of the Odyssey , when Telemakhos journeys to Pylos and calls upon Nestor, Odysseus‚Äô comrade at Troy, seeking news about his long- missing father, he finds Nestor on the seashore, presiding over the Pylians‚Äô grand sacrifi ce to Poseidon, the sea god.\\" Cambridge University Press Festivals, Feasts and Gender Relations in Ancient China and Greece (2010), page 74 Telemachus, kindly and entertains him lavishly but is unable to furnish any information on his father's fate. Also appearing in the Odyssey are Nestor's wife Eurydice and their remaining living sons: Echephron, Stratius, Aretus, Thrasymedes and Peisistratus. Nestor also had two daughters named Pisidice and Polycaste. =Advice= Nestor's advice in the Iliad, while always respected by his listeners due to his age and experience, is always tempered with a sub-text of humor at his expense due to his boastfulness, as he is never able to dispense the advice without first spending several paragraphs recounting his own heroic actions in the past when faced with similar circumstances. In the Odyssey, too, Homer's admiration of Nestor is tempered by some humor at his expense: Telemachus, having returned to Nestor's home from a visit to Helen of Troy and Menelaus (where he has sought further information on his father's fate), urges Peisistratus to let him board his vessel immediately to return home rather than being subjected to a further dose of Nestor's rather overwhelming sense of hospitality. Peisistratus readily agrees, although ruefully stating that his father is bound to be furious when he learns of Telemachus's departure. Nestor and his sons sacrifice to Poseidon on the beach at Pylos (Attic red-figure calyx- krater, 400‚Äì380 BC). Nestor's advice in the Iliad has also been interpreted to have sinister undertones. For example, when Patroclus comes to Nestor for advice in Book 11, Nestor persuades him that it is urgent for him to disguise himself as Achilles. Karl Reinhardt argues that this is contrary to what Patroclus really originally wanted ‚Äì in fact, he is only there to receive information on behalf of Achilles about the wounded Machaon.Reinhardt, Karl (1961). Die Iliad und ihr Dichter, Gottingen, 258‚Äì61. Reinhardt notes that an \\"unimportant errand left behind by an all-important one ... Patroclus' role as messenger is crucial and an ironic purpose permeates the encounter.\\" Homer offers contradictory portrayals of Nestor as a source of advice. On one hand, Homer describes him as a wise man; Nestor repeatedly offers advice to the Achaeans that has been claimed to be anachronistic in Homer's time ‚Äì for example, arranging the armies by tribes and clans or effectively using chariots in battle.Kirk, G. S. (1987) The Iliad: A Commentary, 1. Books 1‚Äì4 Cambridge University Press, . Yet at the same time Nestor's advice is frequently ineffective. Some examples include Nestor accepting without question the dream Zeus plants in Agamemnon in Book 2 and urging the Achaeans to battle, instructing the Achaeans in Book 4 to use spear techniques that in actuality would be disastrous,Postlethwaite, N. (2000) Homer‚Äôs Iliad: A Commentary on the Translation of Richmond Lattimore, Exeter, on 4.301‚Äì9. and in Book 11 giving advice to Patroclus that ultimately leads to his death. Yet Nestor is never questioned and instead is frequently praised.Examples include Iliad 2.372, 4.293 and 11.627. Hanna Roisman explains that the characters in the Iliad ignore the discrepancy between the quality of Nestor's advice and its outcomes because, in the world of the Iliad, \\"outcomes are ultimately in the hands of the ever arbitrary and fickle gods ... heroes are not necessarily viewed as responsible when things go awry.\\" In the Iliad, people are judged not necessarily in the modern view of results, but as people. Therefore, Nestor should be viewed as a good counselor because of the qualities he possesses as described in his introduction in Book 1 ‚Äì as a man of \\"sweet words,\\" a \\"clear-voiced orator,\\" and whose voice \\"flows sweeter than honey.\\"Iliad 1.247‚Äì253 These are elements that make up Nestor, and they parallel the elements that Homer describes as part of a good counselor at Iliad 3.150‚Äì152. Therefore, \\"the definition tells us that Nestor, as a good advisor, possesses the three features ... that it designates.\\" Nestor is a good counselor inherently, and the consequences of his advice have no bearing on that, a view that differs from how good counselors are viewed today.

He was the third duke of Broglie and served as president of the Council during the July Monarchy, from August 1830 to November 1830 and from March 1835 to February 1836. Victor de Broglie was close to the liberal Doctrinaires who opposed the ultra-royalists and were absorbed, under Louis- Philippe's rule, by the Orl√©anists. Biography =Early life= Victor de Broglie was born in Paris on 28 November 1785, the youngest child and only son of Charles-Louis-Victor, prince de Broglie, and grandson of Victor-Fran√ßois, 2nd duc de Broglie. While his grandfather emigrated, his parents were imprisoned during the Terror. His father was guillotined in 1794, but his mother, the former Countess Sophie de Rosen (Paris 10 Mar 1764Paris 31 Oct 1828) managed to escape to Switzerland, where she remained until the fall of Robespierre. She then returned to Paris with her children ‚Äì three older daughters and one son‚Äì and lived there quietly until 1796, when she married the Marc-Ren√©-Voyer de Paulmy, marquis d'Argenson, grandson of Louis XV's minister of war. On his grandfather's death in 1804, Victor de Broglie became the third duc de Broglie. Under the care of his stepfather, the young duke received a careful and liberal education and made his entr√©e into the aristocratic and literary society of Paris under the First French Empire. In 1821, his wife Albertine, the daughter of Erik Magnus Sta√´l von Holstein (Albertine's biological father may have been Benjamin Constant )Goodden, Angelica (2008). Madame de Sta√´l : the dangerous exile. Oxford University Press. . p. 31 and Madame de Sta√´l, gave birth to Albert, who would become the fourth duke of Broglie. His first-born daughter Louise would publish novels and biographies, and be famously painted by Ingres; another son, Auguste, would have an ecclesiastical and academic career. =Career= In 1809, De Broglie was appointed a member of the Council of State, over which the Napoleon Bonaparte presided in person. In addition, he was sent by the Emperor on diplomatic missions, as an attach√©, to various countries. Though he had never been in sympathy with the principles of the Empire, the duc de Broglie was not one of those who rejoiced at its downfall. In common with all men of experience and sense, he realized the danger to France of the rise to power of the forces of violent reaction. With Decazes and Richelieu, he saw that the only hope for a calm future lay in the reconciliation of the Restoration with the French Revolution. By the influence of his uncle, Am√©d√©e de Broglie, his right to a peerage had been recognized, and to his own great surprise he received, in June 1814, a summons from Louis XVIII to the Chamber of Peers. There, after the Hundred Days, he distinguished himself by his courageous defence of Marshal Ney, for whose acquittal he, alone of all the peers, both spoke and voted. After this defiant act of opposition it was perhaps fortunate that his impending marriage gave him an excuse for leaving the country. On 15 February 1816, he was married at Leghorn to Albertine, baroness Sta√´l von Holstein, the daughter of Madame de Sta√´l. He returned to Paris at the end of the year, but took no part in politics until the elections of September 1816 broke the power of the ultraroyalists and substituted for the Chambre introuvable a moderate assembly composed of liberal Doctrinaires. De Broglie's political attitude during the years that followed is best summed up in his own words: =The July Monarchy = During the last critical years of Charles X's reign, De Broglie identified himself with the liberal party ‚Äì the Doctrinaires, among whom Royer-Collard and Guizot were the most prominent. The July Revolution of 1830 placed him in a difficult position; he knew nothing of the intrigues which placed Louis Philippe on the throne; the revolution accomplished, however, he was ready to uphold the fait accompli with characteristic loyalty, and on 9 August 1830 took office in the new government as President of the Council and Minister of Public Worship and Education. As he had foreseen, the ministry was short-lived, and on 2 November he was once more out of office. During the critical time that followed, he consistently supported the principles which triumphed with the fall of Laffitte, representative of the center-left Parti du mouvement, and the accession to power of Casimir Perier, leader of the center-right Parti de la r√©sistance, in March 1831. After the death of the latter and the insurrection of June 1832, De Broglie took office once more as Minister for Foreign Affairs (11 October). His tenure of the foreign office was coincident with a very critical period in international relations. But for the sympathy of Britain under Palmerston, the July Monarchy would have been completely isolated in Europe, and this sympathy the aggressive policy of France in Belgium and on the Mediterranean coast of Africa had been in danger of alienating. The Belgian crisis had been settled, so far as the two powers were concerned, before De Broglie took office, but the concerted military and naval action for the coercion of the Dutch, which led to the French occupation of Antwerp, was carried out under his auspices. The good understanding of which this was the symbol characterized also the relations of De Broglie and Palmerston during the crisis of the first war of Muhammad Ali with the Porte, and in the affairs of the Spanish peninsula their common sympathy with constitutional liberty led to an agreement for common action, which took shape in the Quadruple Alliance between Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, signed at London on 22 April 1834. De Broglie had retired from office in the March preceding, and did not return to power until March of the following year, when he became head of the cabinet. One of De Broglie's first act on his return was to have the National Assembly ratify the 4 July 1831 treaty with the United States, which it had rejected during his first term. His cabinet also voted the 1835 laws restricting freedom of press, following Giuseppe Fieschi's attempted assassination against Louis-Philippe in July 1835. In 1836, the government having been defeated on a proposal to reduce the five percents tax, he once more resigned. > He had remained in power long enough to prove what honesty of purpose, > experience of affairs, and common sense can accomplish when allied with > authority. The debt that France and Europe owed him may be measured by > comparing the results of his policy with that of his successors under not > dissimilar circumstances. He had found France isolated and Europe full of > the rumours of war; he left her strong in the English alliance and the > respect of Liberal Europe, and Europe freed from the restless apprehensions > which were to be stirred into life again by the attitude of Thiers in the > Eastern Question and of Guizot in the affair of the Spanish Marriages. From 1836 to 1848, De Broglie held almost completely aloof from politics, to which his scholarly temperament little inclined him, a disinclination strengthened by the death of his wife on 22 September 1838. His friendship for Guizot, however, induced him to accept a temporary mission in 1845, and in 1847 to go as French ambassador to London. =Second Republic and Second Empire= The revolution of 1848 was a great blow to him, for he realized that it meant the final ruin of the constitutional monarchy, in his view the political system best suited to France. He took his seat, however, in the republican National Assembly and in the Convention of 1848, and, as a member of the section known as the \\"Burgraves\\", fought against both socialism and what he foresaw as a coming autocratic reaction. He shared with his colleagues the indignity of the 2 December 1851 coup, and remained for the remainder of his life one of the bitterest enemies of the Second Empire, though he was heard to remark, with that caustic wit for which he was famous, that the empire was the government which the poorer classes in France desired and the rich deserved. The last twenty years of his life were devoted chiefly to philosophical and literary pursuits. Having been brought up by his stepfather in the sceptical opinions of the time, he gradually arrived at a sincere belief in the Christian religion. \\"I shall die,\\" he said, \\"a penitent Christian and an impenitent Liberal\\". His literary works, though few of them have been published, were rewarded in 1856 by a seat in the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, replacing Louis de Beaupoil de Saint-Aulaire, and he was also a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques. In the labors of those learned bodies he took an active and assiduous part.  Honours  *1833: Grand cordon of the Order of Leopold.RD of 22.04.1833 Works Besides his Souvenirs, in 4 vols.

He arrived in Lofond (probably the island of Lov√∂n or the Lagunda Hundred), where Eysteinn was at a feast. S√∂lve and his men surrounded the house and set it on fire burning everyone inside to death. Then S√∂lve arrived at Sigtuna (Old Sigtuna) and ordered the Swedes to accept him as king.

Career =Early work= Milligan, who was born in London, England, started his comic career with Sounds music paper's comic strip The Electric Hoax, with Brendan McCarthy, with whom he went to art school. Milligan later moved to write short stories for 2000 AD in the early 1980s. By 1986, Milligan had his first ongoing strip in 2000AD called \\"Bad Company\\", with artists Brett Ewins and Jim McCarthy. \\"Bad Company\\" was a popular future war story and helped Milligan become better known. Concurrently, Milligan, Ewins and Brendan McCarthy had been working on the anthology title, Strange Days for Eclipse Comics. Strange Days featured three strips, \\"Paradax\\", \\"Freakwave\\", and \\"Johnny Nemo\\". Milligan, McCarthy and Ewins produced three issues of this psychedelic comic, it was not a great seller but it picked up a small, loyal readership. The most conventional strip, \\"Johnny Nemo\\", had its own series, while the more quirky \\"Paradax\\" had a two-issue series published by Vortex Comics in 1987. By 1989 Milligan was swapping between strips such as \\"Bad Company\\", while still writing material in 2000AD, such as \\"Hewligan's Haircut\\" with artist Jamie Hewlett. Milligan and artist Jim McCarthy created the Steve Ditko-inspired \\"Bix Barton\\". This was first run as a black and white strip for its first outing, \\"Barton's Beasts\\"; the second strip was called \\"Carry On Barton\\" (originally \\"Carry On Snuffing\\"). The strip was very popular and was a precursor of \\"Devlin Waugh\\" and others. In 1989 he had his first work published by DC Comics. Skreemer was a six-issue mini-series (May 1989 ‚Äì October 1989) drawn by Brett Ewins that was somewhat lost in the midst of the so-called \\"British Invasion\\" of American comics of the time. A dark post-apocalyptic gangster story, it did receive critical acclaim but did not sell well. Milligan was soon to become a regular writer for DC while still working on his more personal comics in the United Kingdom in comics such as 2000 AD, and its spin-off titles Crisis and Revolver. =Skin= Skin (art by Brendan McCarthy) was the story of a young thalidomide skinhead in 1970s London, and his attempts to deal with his disability and the world in general. The strip was due to feature in Crisis in 1990 but the publishers Fleetway were worried by the controversial subject matter, plus they were concerned with the use of explicit language in the story. The printers refused to print it, blaming the graphic language and controversial subject matter as a reason. The story remained in limbo until eventually being published as a graphic novel by Tundra Press to little controversy. =The 1990s= The 1990s saw Milligan revamp Steve Ditko's character Shade, the Changing Man for DC Comics. This proved his most successful American comic, and came at the end of the first wave of \\"The British Invasion\\". With issue No. 33 (March 1993), it became part of the Vertigo imprint.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 262 It was cancelled with issue No. 70 (April 1996). A one-off story marking Vertigo's tenth anniversary was published in 2003. Milligan succeeded Grant Morrison on Animal Man for a six- issue run in 1990‚Äì1991, and became the regular writer of Batman in Detective Comics in the same year. During an editorial meeting, Milligan presented the idea that led to the creation of Azrael, who became Batman during the \\"Knightfall\\" crossover. Milligan and artist Duncan Fegredo created Enigma for Disney Comics' planned Touchmark imprint. When the Touchmark line was cancelled, the project moved to DC's newly launched Vertigo line in 1993.Irvine \\"Enigma\\" in Dougall, p. 66 Milligan quickly followed this up with The Extremist with artist Ted McKeever.Irvine \\"The Extremist\\" in Dougall, p. 71 Both titles dealt with taboo subjects for a mainstream publisher, but were applauded by their handling of these subjects. Milligan and artist Mike Deodato launched the Elektra series for Marvel Comics in November 1996. Milligan spent the remainder of the decade writing one-off specials such as Face and The Eaters, or miniseries like Egypt and Tank Girl The Odyssey (with its co-creator Jamie Hewlett providing art), as well as acting as advisory editor to Paul Honeyford's Fighting Figurines. Milligan and Brendan McCarthy's psychedelic comic Rogan Gosh was reprinted in a collected edition by Vertigo in 1996, after being first serialised six years earlier in Revolver. Milligan rounded out the decade by writing a The Human Target four-issue miniseries (April 1999 ‚Äì July 1999).Irvine \\"Human Target\\" in Dougall, pp. 90‚Äì91 =X-Force / X-Statix= In 2001, Marvel Comics' new editor-in-chief Joe Quesada began revamping the X-Men family of titles. Milligan and artist Mike Allred took over X-Force with issue No. 116 (July 2001),Manning \\"2000s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 306: \\"X-Force, an X-Men spinoff, received a makeover in July [2001] thanks to writer Peter Milligan and artist Mike Allred. A mixture of dark comedy and underground heroics, X-Force received critical acclaim, but a mixed reaction from fans.\\" and immediately replaced the book's Rob Liefeld- styled team with a more satirical one: the Orphan, the Anarchist, U-Go Girl, Phat, Vivisector, Venus Dee Milo, Dead Girl and Doop. X-Force was cancelled with issue No. 129 (August 2002), and replaced by a new title, X-Statix, with Milligan and Allred continuing as the creative force. Milligan proposed a character based on a resurrected Princess Diana. News spread to the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mail, which strongly objected. Eventually the character was altered, as were the references to the British Royal Family. X-Statix was cancelled with issue No. 26 (Oct. 2004). =2000 onward= Milligan's film work includes the screenplay for Pilgrim (2000, also known as Inferno), starring Ray Liotta. He scripted the 2002 adaptation of the Melvin Burgess novel An Angel for May. He wrote issues #166‚Äì187 of X-Men, teamed with artist Salvador Larroca, in 2005. Milligan returned to The Human Target with the graphic novel Final Cut, followed by all 21 issues of the subsequent series for Vertigo. In 2006, he wrote the X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl five- issue miniseries for Marvel collaborating with artist Nick Dragotta and co- creator Mike Allred. The following year he wrote an Infinity, Inc. limited series for DC and The Programme for Wildstorm, starring a Soviet Cold War superhero. Milligan was involved in 2007's Batman crossover, \\"The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul\\", by writing the lead-in Batman Annual No. 26, as well as the parts of the storyline in the Robin monthly title. Milligan scripted for the BBC interactive animated series Meta4orce and the Sub-Mariner: The Depths limited series for Marvel's Marvel Knights imprint. In late 2008, Milligan was named writer for the long-running Vertigo series Hellblazer, and wrote that imprint's Greek Street, Additionally, for Marvel, he wrote the 2008 one-shot Moon Knight: Silent Knight, with artist Laurence Campbell. Following DC's 2011 relaunch, Milligan became the writer of Red Lanterns, an ongoing series which debuted in September 2011. He wrote Justice League Dark, a spin-off of the Justice League franchise, starring John Constantine and Shade, the Changing Man. up to issue No. 8 (June 2012), following which he moved to Stormwatch from issue No. 9 (July 2012).

He was born in the village Mjels on the island of Als in North Schleswig, in modern-day Denmark. His mother died when he was 3, and in 1900 he went to live with his aunt and was enrolled in the Realgymnasium. In 1907 he was expelled for membership to an illicit student club. Nevertheless, he matriculated at the University of Kiel in 1908. Nielsen completed his doctoral dissertation in 1913. Soon thereafter, he was drafted into the German Imperial Navy. He was assigned to coastal defense. In 1915 he was sent to Constantinople as a military adviser to the Turkish Government. After the war, in the spring of 1919, Nielsen married Carola von Pieverling, a German medical doctor. In 1920 Nielsen took a position at the Technical University of Breslau. The next year he published a paper in Mathematisk Tidsskrift in which he proved that any subgroup of a finitely generated free group is free. In 1926 Otto Schreier would generalize this result by removing the condition that the free group be finitely generated; this result is now known as the Nielsen‚ÄìSchreier theorem. Also in 1921 Nielsen moved to the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen, where he would stay until 1925, when he moved to the Technical University in Copenhagen. He also proved the Dehn‚ÄìNielsen theorem on mapping class groups. Nielsen was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo. During World War II some efforts were made to bring Nielsen to the United States as it was feared that he would be assaulted by the Nazis. Nielsen would, in fact, stay in Denmark during the war without being harassed by the Nazis. In 1951 Nielsen became professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen, taking the position vacated by the death of Harald Bohr. He resigned this position in 1955 because of his international undertakings, in particular with UNESCO, where he served on the executive board from 1952 to 1958.

The Great Falls of the Passaic River is a prominent waterfall, high, on the Passaic River in the city of Paterson in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States. The falls and surrounding area are protected as part of the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, administered by the National Park Service. The Congress authorized its establishment in 2009. One of the United States' largest waterfalls, it played a significant role in the early industrial development of New Jersey starting in the earliest days of the nation. It is part of the Great Falls of Paterson‚ÄìGarret Mountain National Natural Landmark.NPS NNL Summary for Great Falls and Garret Mountain It has also been designated as a National Historic Landmark District since 1976. The Great Falls' raceway and power systems were designated an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1977. History =Formation and early history= Geologically, the falls were formed at the end of the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago. Formerly the Passaic had followed a shorter course through the Watchung Mountains near present-day Summit. As the glacier receded, the river's previous course was blocked by a newly formed moraine. A large lake, called Glacial Lake Passaic, formed behind the Watchungs. As the ice receded, the river found a new circuitous route around the north end of the Watchungs, carving the spectacular falls through the underlying basalt, which was formed approximately 200 million years ago. The falls later became the site of a habitation for Lenape Native Americans, and later for Dutch settlers in the 1690s. =Industrial development= Statue of Hamilton overlooking the falls In 1778, Alexander Hamilton visited the falls and was impressed by its potential for industry. Later when Hamilton was the nation's Secretary of Treasury, he selected the site of the nation's first planned industrial city, which he called a \\"national manufactory.\\" In 1791, Hamilton helped found the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), state-chartered private corporation to fulfill this vision. The town of Paterson was founded by the society and named after New Jersey Governor William Paterson in appreciation of his efforts to promote the society. Hamilton commissioned civil engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant, responsible for the layout of the new capital at Washington, D.C., to design the system of canals known as raceways supplying the power for the watermills in the new town. As a result, Paterson became the nucleus for a burgeoning mill industry. In 1792, David Godwin was commissioned to build the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in New Jersey. He subsequently built the first dam on the falls; it was a structure made of wood. In 1812, it was the site of the state's first continuous roll paper mill. Other products whose construction used the falls as a power source include the Rogers Locomotive Works (1832), the Colt revolver (1837), and the USS Holland (SS-1) (1898). The oldest extant structure in the historic district is the Phoenix Mill, built in 1813. The industrial area also became the site of labor unrest, as it was a center for the 1913 Paterson silk strike. Immigrant workers, facing harsh conditions in factories staged numerous strikes, giving the United States its first organized labor movement. Engraving after a drawing of the falls made by Thomas Pownall in the 1750s The society continued operation until 1945 when its charter and property were sold to the city of Paterson. The area fell into disuse with the steep decline of industry in the region during the 20th century. In 1971, the Great Falls Preservation and Development Corporation was established to restore and redevelop the historic mill buildings and raceways. =Great Falls State Park= The State of New Jersey announced plans for a new urban state park in Paterson surrounding the Great Falls, called Great Falls State Park, in 2007. The master plan for the park called for utilizing surrounding industrial areas for parklands that include a trail network and recreation areas, and creating new areas to view the falls. These plans were superseded by the establishment of Great Falls National Historical Park (see below).  Viewing the falls  Viewing area after 8 inches (200 mm) of rain drenched Northern New Jersey during the second week of April 2007. The Falls are viewable from Haines Overlook Park on the south and Mary Ellen Kramer Park on the north. Drive-by viewing is available from McBride Avenue where it crosses the river just above the Falls. A footbridge over the Falls gorge (historically, the eighth such bridge to span this chasm) also serves as an outlook point. A visitor's center at the corner of Spruce and McBride Avenues, in the Great Falls Historic District, provides a historical overview of the falls and the industrial and cultural history of Paterson. A record 177,000 visitors went to see the Great Falls in 2016.  National Natural Landmark  The falls after Hurricane Irene. The new amphitheater opened in October 2018 at Overlook Park. The Great Falls of Paterson ‚Äì Garret Mountain is a National Natural Landmark designated in January 1967 and were expanded in April 1967 to include nearby Garret Mountain. Together they help demonstrate how jointed basaltic lava flow shaped the geology of the area during the Early Mesozoic period through both extrusion and intrusion. The designation protects the site from federal development, but not from local and state development. Redevelopment of the decayed adjacent industrial areas has been an ongoing controversial topic. An attempt in the 1990s to redevelop the adjacent Allied Textile Printing Co. (ATP) facility, destroyed by fire in the 1980s, into prefabricated townhouses was initially approved by the city but later repelled by a coalition of local citizens seeking to preserve the historic character of the district.  National Historical Park  Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park was authorized to be added to the National Park System of the United States under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act. On March 30, 2009, President Obama signed legislation authorizing the falls as a national historical park, which would provide additional federal protections for the 77-foot waterfall. By 2011, Great Falls State Park and other land along the Passaic River were transferred to the federal government for the creation of the park. Formal establishment as a unit of the National Park System required action by the Secretary of the Interior, which took place November 7, 2011, when Secretary Salazar formally accepted lands on behalf of the United States, and dedicated the park as the nation's 397th park system unit.  Hydroelectric facility  The hydroelectric plant at the falls is operated by Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, which is considering commissioning another facility downstream at the Dundee Dam. The Great Falls hydroelectric plant has three Kaplan type turbines with a total capacity of 10.95 Mwe. Flow through each turbine is 710 cfs, with a total flow of 2,130 cfs, 1,377 MGD. Three 8.5' diameter penstocks feed the turbines, with a velocity 12.5 ft/sec and 8.5 mph.  In popular culture  The unique history of the Great Falls and the city were described in the five- volume philosophical poem Paterson by William Carlos Williams. Among the episodes described in Williams' poem is the 1827 leap over the falls by Sam Patch, who later became the first known person to perform a stunt at Niagara Falls. The 2016 film Paterson, directed by Jim Jarmusch, is partly inspired by the works of Williams and features the falls as a primary location. The Great Falls were also featured in the pilot of the HBO crime drama The Sopranos, as well as in the series' sixth episode, in which two mobsters throw a drug dealer off the bridge and into the falls to his death.

It is described as having the shape and proportions of half a chicken's egg. In 1774, it was encrusted into the Imperial Sceptre of Russian Empress Catherine the Great. History Orlov diamond in the Imperial Sceptre The diamond was found in the 17th century in Golconda, India. According to one legend, a French soldier who had deserted during the Carnatic wars in Srirangam disguised himself as a Hindu convert in order to steal it in 1747, when it served as the eye of a temple deity. The as yet unnamed stone passed from merchant to merchant, eventually appearing for sale in Amsterdam. Shaffrass, an Iranian millionaire who then owned the diamond,Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani (2008), Students' Britannica - India, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (UK) Ltd. p. 134. found an eager buyer in Count Grigory Grigorievich Orlov.Dixon, Simon (2010), Personality and Place in Russian Culture: Essays in Memory of Lindsey Hughes, Modern Humanities Research Assn. p. 171. The Count paid a purported 1,4 mln Dutch florins for it. Count Orlov had been romantically involved with Catherine the Great of Russia for many years, and he led the way in the dethronement of her husband in a coup d'√©tat and the elevation of Catherine to power. Their relationship carried on for many years and produced an illegitimate child, but Catherine eventually forsook Count Orlov for Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin. Count Orlov was said to have tried to rekindle their romance by offering her the diamond, as it is said he knew she had wished for it.Malecka, Anna \\" Did Orlov buy the Orlov ?\\", Gems and Jewellery, July 2014, vol. 23, no. 6, pp. 10‚Äì12. While he failed to regain her affections, Catherine did bestow many gifts upon Count Orlov; these gifts included the Marble Palace in Saint Petersburg. Catherine named the diamond after the Count, and she had her jeweller design a sceptre incorporating the diamond. Now known as the Imperial Sceptre, it was completed in 1774. Actually, as the researchers have proved, Catherine herself bought the diamond and only used Orlov's help with the deal and delivery, inventing the story about his generous present only to avoid criticism for spending the state's budget on jewelry. The Russian empress was very fond of diamonds, and she put them into fashion at her court and even called her personal stallion Diamond. In the 18th century, the sum of 1,4 mln florins was so immense that only the empress herself could afford it, and Count Orlov did not have such a fortune. Also, it is known that the precious stone was bought by installments lasting 7 years, and when Count Orlov was going to pay the first payment, he discovered that it had already been paid from the empress's personal account. Description Sketch of the Orlov diamond from the book Precious Stones by Max Bauer, 1904 A description was given by Eric Burton in 1986: The Orlov is a rarity among historic diamonds, for it retains its original Indian rose-style cut (see diamond cut). Its colour is widely stated as white with a faint bluish-green tinge. Data released by the Kremlin gives the Orlov's measurements as 32 millimetres x 35 millimetres x 21 millimetres, its weight being 189.62 carats (37.924 g). The weight is just an estimate ‚Äì it has not formally been weighed in many years. Lord Twining's book A History of the Crown Jewels of Europe mentions how once, during a circa 1913 inspection of the crown jewels by the curator, the stone accidentally fell out of its sceptre. He weighed the stone, but did not write down its exact weight. He later said that it was about , which corresponds to the measurement-based estimate.

It was founded by American producers and screenwriters Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg.  Films  Amicus's first two films were low-budget musicals for the teenage market, It's Trad, Dad! (1962) and Just for Fun (1963). Prior to establishing Amicus, the two producers collaborated on the horror film The City of the Dead (1960). Amicus made a series of portmanteau horror anthologies, inspired by the Ealing Studios film Dead of Night (1945). They also made some straight thriller films, often based on a gimmick. Amicus's horror and thriller films are sometimes mistaken for the output of the better-known Hammer Film Productions, due to the two companies' similar visual style and use of the same actors, including Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Unlike the period gothic Hammer films, Amicus productions were usually set in the present day. =Portmanteau horror films = Amicus's portmanteau films included Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), directed by Freddie Francis, Torture Garden (1967), The House That Dripped Blood (1971), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), Vault of Horror (1973) and From Beyond the Grave (1974). These films typically feature four or sometimes five short horror stories, linked by an overarching plot featuring a narrator and those listening to his story. The casts of these films are invariably composed of name actors, each of whom play a main part in one of the stories-a small proportion of the film as a whole. Along with genre stars like Cushing, Lee and Herbert Lom, Amicus also drew its actors from the classical British stage (Patrick Magee, Margaret Leighton and Sir Ralph Richardson), younger actors (Donald Sutherland, Robert Powell and Tom Baker), or former stars in decline (Richard Greene, Robert Hutton, and Terry-Thomas). Some, such as Joan Collins, were in their mid-career doldrums when they worked with Amicus. Torture Garden, Asylum and The House That Dripped Blood were written by Robert Bloch, based upon his own stories. An exception was the \\"Waxworks\\" segment of The House That Dripped Blood, which was scripted (uncredited) by Russ Jones, based on Bloch's story. Tales from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror were based on stories from EC horror comics from the 1950s. =Other horror films= Amicus also produced some conventional chillers, such as The Skull (1965), The Deadly Bees (1966), I, Monster (1971), And Now the Screaming Starts! (1973), and The Beast Must Die (1974). The Skull was also based on a Bloch story (though scripted by Milton Subotsky). Bloch was also the screenwriter of Amicus's thriller The Psychopath (1966), and the adaptation of The Deadly Bees (based upon H. F. Heard's A Taste for Honey). =Science fiction, espionage, drama= In the mid-1960s, Amicus also produced two films based on the television series Doctor Who which had debuted on television in 1963. The films, Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) and Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), are the only theatrical film adaptations of the series. In these films, Peter Cushing played \\"Dr. Who\\", a human scientist rather than an alien, with Who as his actual surname, ignoring the backstory of the TV series. Amicus also funded and produced films of other genres. Danger Route (1967) was a film version of Christopher Nicole's (writing as Andrew York) 1966 spy novel The Eliminator, directed by Seth Holt. Amicus produced a film version of Harold Pinter's play The Birthday Party (1968) directed by William Friedkin. Margaret Drabble's adaptation of her novel The Millstone (1965) was filmed as A Touch of Love (1969), and Laurence Moody's novel The Ruthless Ones (1969) was filmed as What Became of Jack and Jill? (1972) Amicus Productions produced a limited number of science fiction films, with a trilogy of adaptations of several of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. After Amicus Milton Subotsky relocated to Canada for a time and unsuccessfully tried to carry on the anthology tradition with such films as The Uncanny (1977) and The Monster Club (1980); Peter Cushing came along for the former but passed on the latter. Subotsky secured the rights to some Stephen King properties in the 1980s and got a credit on the King anthology film Cat's Eye (1985). His final credits, again based on King properties, would be The Lawnmower Man (1992), Sometimes They Come Back (1991) and Sometimes They Come Back... Again (1996), the last title bearing Subotsky's final credit; he had died in 1991.  Today  In 2003, Anchor Bay Entertainment released a five disc DVD box-set of Amicus films in a coffin- shaped container in the UK. In 2005, Amicus was revived to produce homages to the old titles as well as original horror fare. Their first production was Stuart Gordon's Stuck (2007).  Amicus films  * It's Trad, Dad!

Under the society's long-term management of the falls, the industrialization of the area passed through three great waves, centered first on cotton, then steel, and finally silk, over the course of over 150 years. The venture is considered by historians to have been a forerunner for many public‚Äìprivate partnerships in later decades in the United States. History =Alexander Hamilton's vision= The society was the brainchild of United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Tench Coxe, who convinced United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to support the creation of a quasi-public manufacturing town. Hamilton, who had visited the Great Falls of the Passaic River in 1778, envisioned it as a planned industrial site, using the waterfall as source of mechanical power. The society was chartered by New Jersey under Hamilton's direction to exploit the falls for this planned city, which Hamilton called a \\"national manufactory\\". The enterprise was exempt from property taxes for ten years. The society founded the city of Paterson in the vicinity of the falls, naming it in honor of William Paterson, the governor of New Jersey. Hamilton commissioned civil engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant, responsible for the layout of the new capital at Washington, D.C. to design the system of canals known as raceways suppylings the power for the watermills in the new town. The chartering of the company as a state-favored enterprise, exempt from certain taxes, became the prototype for such public-private enterprises in the 19th century. =Shift in strategy= Middle mill race of three. Top race is at left By 1796, the society's efforts to build its own mills had failed, largely because the slow profits it generated were not enough to cover its start-up costs. In 1791 the Society had brought in one Thomas Marshall, who claimed to have been superintendent of the Masson Mill in England, to take charge.Everett et al. (Slater Study Group) (2006) \\"Samuel Slater - Hero or Traitor?\\" Milford, Derbyshire: Maypole Promotions However it would seem that he was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the society successfully promoted real estate development in the area, leasing sites to other private ventures to establish their own mills while maintaining control of the falls as a power source through ownership of the dams and raceways that supplied the mills. The company's management of the falls subsequently became a lucrative source of profits as the area became the nucleus for a burgeoning mill industry. By 1815, thirteen water-powered cotton mills were operating beside the falls, operated by over 2,000 workers. As a result of the society's success in promoting industry, the population of Paterson grew from 500 in the 1790s to over 5,000 by 1820. In 1830, the society was involved in a dispute with the recently formed Morris Canal and Banking Company, which had been chartered to build a canal connecting the Passaic River to the Delaware River. The Morris Canal Company had placed a dam on the Rockaway River and diverted water for its own purposes, thus reducing the volume of flow over the falls and threatening the society's ventures. The subsequent court decision allowed the Morris Canal to be built without disrupting the water supply to the falls. The company's harnessing of the falls for mill operations was described in 1834 by publisher Thomas Gordon who wrote in the Gazetteer of the State of New Jersey: :A dam of 4 feet high, strongly framed and bolted into the rock in the bed of the river above the falls, turns the stream through a canal excavated in the traprock of the bank, into a basin; whence, through strong guardgates, it supplies in succession three canals on separate planes, each below the other; giving to the mills on each, a head and fall of about 22 feet. By means of the guardgate, the volume of water is regulated at pleasure, and uniform height preserved...The expense of maintaining the dam, canals, and main sluicegates, and of regulating the water, is borne by the company. =Evolution of local industry= During the 19th century, the success of mill operations attracted many immigrants experienced in mill operations from England, Scotland, Ireland and other areas of Europe. Some artisans brought with them illegal copies of British mill operations which were subsequently duplicated in Paterson. By the 1830s, the textile mill industry in the area had been surpassed by larger and better- capitalized steam-powered operations in New England. As a result, the local mill industry shifted toward the manufacture of steel and locomotives. The Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works, which began operating in 1832, was the first such success. By the time of the American Civil War, the milling of steel and the manufacture of locomotives had become the dominant industry. In the 1880s, the area became the center of the nation's silk industry. The society continued operations into the 20th century but fell into decline with the abandonment of the area by industry. In 1945, the society's charter and property were acquired by the city of Paterson.

Origins After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and then the fall of Mistra in the Despotate of the Morea, most of the plains of present- day Greece fell entirely into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The only territories that did not fall under Ottoman rule were the mountain ranges (populated by Greeks and inaccessible to the Ottoman Turks), as well as a handful of islands and coastal possessions under the control of Venice. This situation lasted until 1821. However, the newly acquired territories of Greece, such as Macedonia, Thrace and Epirus, were in Turkish hands until the 20th century. This period of time in Greece is known as the Turkocracy. Ottoman lands were divided up into pashaliks, also called eyalets; in the case of the lands that form present-day Greece, these were Morea and Roumelia. Pashaliks were further sub-divided into sanjaks which were often divided into feudal chifliks (Turkish √ßiftlik (farm), Greek œÑœÉŒπœÜŒªŒØŒ∫Œπ tsifliki). Any surviving Greek troops, whether regular Byzantine forces, local militia, or mercenaries had either to join the Ottoman army as janissaries, serve in the private army of a local Ottoman notable, or fend for themselves. Many Greeks wishing to preserve their Greek identity, Orthodox Christian religion, and independence chose the difficult but liberated life of a bandit. These bandit groups soon found their ranks swelled with impoverished and/or adventurous peasants, societal outcasts, and escaped criminals. Klephts under Ottoman rule were generally men who were fleeing vendettas or taxes, debts and reprisals from Ottoman officials. They raided travelers and isolated settlements and lived in the rugged mountains and back country. Most klephtic bands participated in some form in the Greek War of Independence. During the Greek War of Independence, the klephts, along with the armatoloi, formed the nucleus of the Greek fighting forces, and played a prominent part throughout its duration. Yannis Makriyannis referred to the \\"klephtes and armatoloi\\" as the \\"yeast of liberty\\". John Koliopoulos studied the klephts in the 19th century, and stated that the principle of kinship and honour seen in Albanian besa could be seen among the klephts after centuries of contact with Albanian irregulars. Songs Antonis Katsantonis (Greek klepht) by Theophilos Hatzimihail. Klephtic songs (Greek: Œ∫ŒªŒ≠œÜœÑŒπŒ∫Œ± œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒ±), or ballads, were developed in mainland Greece. They are part of the Greek folk music genre, which includes folk poetry, and are thematically oriented on either the achievements and death of a single klepht or the generic life of the klephts as a group. Klephtic songs are especially popular in Epirus and the Peloponnese. The Czech composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k wrote a song-cycle named Three Modern Greek Poems: the first one is entitled \\"Koljas ‚Äì Klepht Song\\" and tells the story of Koljas, the klepht who killed the famous Ali Pasha. The most famous klephtic and modern Greek folk song is The Battle of Mount Olympus and Mount Kisavos, a ballad based on a musico-poetic motif dating back to classical Greece (specifically to the poetic song composed by Corinna pertaining to a contest between Mount Helicon and Mount Cithaeron). Cuisine The famous Greek dish klephtiko (or kleftiko), a dish entailing slow-cooked lamb (or other meat), can be translated \\"in the style of the klephts\\". The klephts, not having flocks of their own, would steal lambs or goats and cook the meat in a sealed pit to avoid the smoke being seen.

Both sets are located near Lake Superior in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The water is notably brown in color from the tannins leached from the cedar swamps which the river drains. Consequently, the upper falls are nicknamed, \\"The Root Beer Falls\\". The upper falls are more than 200 feet (60 m) across and with a drop of approximately 48 feet (14 m) During the late spring runoff, the river drains as much as of water per second, making the upper falls the third most voluminous vertical waterfall east of the Mississippi River, after Niagara Falls and Cohoes Falls. Cohoes Falls is located in New York State, whereas Niagara Falls is located on the US-Canadian border, between the Province of Ontario and the State of New York. The lower falls, located four miles (6.5 km) downstream, are a series of five smaller falls cascading around an island which can be reached by rowboat. A hiking trail runs between the falls along the riverside, and visitors often play in the lower falls during the summer heat. The falls are within Tahquamenon Falls State Park, between Newberry, Michigan, and Paradise, Michigan. They are a popular tourist destination in the Upper Peninsula during all seasons. Snowmobile trails lead almost to the falls, and walkways are kept clear for most of the winter. While the name Tahquamenon is now primarily associated with the falls, it appears to have originally designated an island in Whitefish Bay: Tahquamenon Island. The first written record of the name appears as \\"Outakouaminan\\" in a 1671 French map. The upper falls are located at , and the lower falls are at In popular culture The Tahquamenon is noted as being the land of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha, which contains the line: \\"by the rushing Tahquamenaw\\", where Hiawatha built his canoe.

It first appeared in program (issue) 119 in 1979 and continues to run as of 2018. Art for the opening episodes was by Kevin O'Neill, Mike McMahon, Brett Ewins, and Brendan McCarthy, who among them designed the original seven members of the team. Since then they have been illustrated primarily, though not exclusively, by Bryan Talbot, Simon Bisley, SMS, Kevin Walker, Henry Flint and Clint Langley. The A.B.C. Warriors are a team of war robots designed to withstand 'Atomic', 'Bacterial' and 'Chemical' warfare. They were built to take part in the long-running Volgan War, which Mills had described in several previous 2000 AD strips, including Invasion! and Ro-Busters. Each robot has a distinctive personality ‚Äì often one programmed by its human creators ‚Äì but each is more or less able to act with free will. Overview One of the main characters, Hammerstein, was already known to 2000 AD readers through the story Ro-Busters (originally started in the magazine Starlord). The story of the creation of robotic warriors to be used in the Volgan War had been introduced in the Ro-Busters story \\"Hammerstein's War Memoirs\\". Hammerstein is the only ABC Warrior to appear in film, making a cameo appearance in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie. The initial run of stories from progs 119‚Äì128 follows Hammerstein towards the end of the Volgan War as he recruits six robots to join him for a special mission ‚Äì to tame Mars, which had become a futuristic Wild West. In further adventures set much later in time, the warriors teamed up with Nemesis the Warlock in his fight against the Termight Empire and to prevent a destabilised Black Hole bypass at the Earth's core destroying the world. Many of these early stories pursue the theme of humans using robots to do jobs that they do not wish to do themselves (following the same theme as Ro-Busters), and the cruel treatment of soldier robots by their human officers. The Warriors often find themselves at odds with humans who are exploiting the land and the beings that live on it ‚Äì typical storylines see the Warriors identifying such evil and delivering poetic justice to the perpetrators. Later stories also explore ideas of \\"khaos\\", and the concept of programmed robots being able to discover their true identities. British comics artists who illustrated ABC Warriors include Kevin O'Neill, Mike McMahon, Brett Ewins, Brendan McCarthy, Carlos Ezquerra, Dave Gibbons, Simon Bisley, Kev Walker and Henry Flint. Characters The members of the Warriors have changed over the course of the stories they have been featured in. Here are the longest-serving members: =Hammerstein= Hammerstein has been the leader of the Warriors for most of the comic's run, although he has surrendered the position to Deadlock for a number of stories. As told in the story The Black Hole, he was the first successful war robot to be built, this success was due to him being given both emotions and a conscience which allowed him to distinguish between combatants and civilians. In the first run of ABC Warriors stories, he was recruited during the Volgan Wars by the mysterious Colonel Lash to lead the ABC Warriors on Lash's post war project. Overall humanoid in form, his right 'hand' is the combat hammer that gives him his name. Depicted as noble, brave and patriotic, he has always represented the compassionate 'heart' of the team, while remaining a formidable warrior. =Deadlock= Deadlock is a follower of the fictional Khaos religion, and as such is often at odds with the order and duty-fixated Hammerstein, which in the story The Black Hole ultimately led him to betray and attempt to kill Hammerstein. Deadlock's powers allow him to astrally project and reform his body if it is damaged or destroyed, and he holds the sword X-Caliber, a weapon that allows him to drain the souls of the living to use as psychic 'nourishment'. He is able to call demons and the undead to his aid. For a time Deadlock led the team in place of Hammerstein, being the only other member ever to do so. When first shown, Deadlock was the Grand Wizard of the Knights Martial, a group of highly intelligent robots who had developed psychic and magical abilities and observed the war from the 'Watch Tower' space station. They were given special authority to try and execute Volgan war criminals during the conflict, as well as war criminals from their own side. Deadlock occasionally led his Knights into active combat, such as to take down and reprogram Volgan robot general Volkhan so he could no longer create robots outside of human control. The Watch Tower was brought to earth by Volgan artillery during the war, just before Hammerstein recruited Deadlock for the Mars mission. On his eventual return, Deadlock discovered that in his absence the Knights ‚Äì no longer kept chaste and pure by isolation far above the earth's surface ‚Äì had been tainted and turned to frivolous pursuits, ignoring the old values of meditation, purity and discipline. A disgusted Deadlock turned his back on the order and went into isolation, meditating and studying ancient manuscripts in an attempt to reach the highest level of the astral plane, and join with his master Khaos. When he was ready it was Nemesis himself who came for him and they became one, as shown in Nemesis the Warlock Book Four: The Gothic Empire. Centuries passed with no word of his whereabouts, though at some point he established a Kollege of Khaos on the comet Tiamat. He finally reappeared in the bowels of Terra, to assist older versions of his former comrades, sent back from the future Termight by Nemesis the Warlock, to save the planet from destruction ‚Äì a mission depicted in the story The Black Hole. Although his motives were unclear at first, he assisted the Warriors in their battles with the Monad, a creature from the end of time, only to betray them when they finally reached their goal. It turned out he had been sent by his master Khaos to ensure the destruction of Termight so Khaos might spread throughout the galaxy. With the assistance of Blackblood and Mek-Quake, Deadlock launched a fearsome attack on his comrades in a bid to stop them from repairing the damage done to the Time Wastes; he was forced to betray his master and save Termight so the Monad would not use the planet's destruction to turn Khaos into an evil force. Escaping the Time Wastes, Deadlock assumed leadership of The Warriors and led them to Nemesis' home planet, Gandarva, to settle a score. The repair of the Time Wastes had restored Order to the galaxy and thus Deadlock and Nemesis had both betrayed Khaos. The two of them fought literally to the death, only to be reborn, purged of their guilt. Deadlock then took the Warriors to the planet Hekate, inducting them (both willingly and forcibly) into the ways of Khaos; he led them in collecting the heads of seven symbols of order, which could be used in a ritual to spread Khaos throughout the galaxy. After succeeding, the other Warriors denounced his command, proving themselves true Khaos warriors. Following this, he returned to his Kollege with Ro-Jaws, who understood the twisting tides of Khaos even better than he did. They worked to indoctrinate students into the ways of Khaos ‚Äì often via the bar ‚Äì while also hunting down teachers throughout the galaxy and flying back to the Kollege to be endlessly tortured. Ten years after the Hekate mission he initiated the reformation of the Warriors to battle the Terran weapon Hellbringer. Subsequently, they returned to Mars under the command of Hammerstein, where Deadlock was instrumental in bringing about an end to the war between the human colonists and the planetary consciousness, Medusa. Deadlock helped broker a peace and he stayed on to help the Warriors in the resulting Martian civil war. It was Deadlock who discovered that the Confederacy of Martian Industries was assembling the mercenary Shadow Warriors team to destroy the Warriors, who learned the identities of its members and whose khaos rituals turned the tide in the final battle against them. =Joe Pineapples= Joe Pineapples is the closest thing Hammerstein has to a friend, being his longest-serving comrade. Joe was built as an assassin, a former member of the elite X-Terminators (he was fired for an unspecified incident involving an officer's wife), and is a sniper without equal. Joe has rebuilt himself many times to give himself new looks over the years, but one thing that has been consistent is his narcissism ‚Äì the one thing he truly loves in the universe is himself. With an outward image of ice cold professionalism and a habit of seducing women, he has a secret fetish for wearing women's underwear. The first run of ABC Warriors stories showed Joe's talents taking him into Volgograd to assassinate Volgan general Volkhan, and afterwards assigned to the Mars mission; he forcibly recruited General Blackblood by shooting the butcher through the heart, beginning a long-standing feud between the two. After Mars, Pineapples wound up working as a police instructor in London and once had to neutralise a rampaging Hammerstein who thought he was still fighting the Volgan War. Joe's career with various police forces continued in some form for centuries, and by the time Earth had become Termight he was on the free robot planet of Mekka working as an undercover officer. At some point he developed a hatred of humans (\\"meatheads\\") and was eventually put on the black list for pursuing human criminals with too much zeal. Pineapples also began taking up transvestism, apparently jaded with re- building himself time and time again and wanting to experience something new. Blackblood was able to obtain photo negatives of this. At the request of Nemesis the Warlock, Joe left the police to rejoin the ABC Warriors in the battle to defend the Gothic Empire. Following the battle against Termight, the Warriors followed Nemesis into the Time Wastes of Termight to find the Warlock's offspring Thoth and repair the damage Thoth was doing to time itself, and save the galaxy. When Deadlock tried to sabotage the mission, Blackblood and Joe fought each other. For Pineapples it was a chance to get the negatives back, and for Blackblood it was a chance to finally discover what Joe had been hiding in his chest locker for the entire journey. As it turned out, the mystery item was a human heart: Joe was carrying it in a desperate bid to feel, so he could enjoy killing again. After escaping to the planet Hekate, Pineapples helped collect the seven heads needed for the ritual that would spread Khaos through the galaxy, but suffered a breakdown as the 'Night of the Blood Moon' approached. Deadlock took it upon himself to perform an unnecessary operation on Joe, to give him a much more Khaotic outlook on life ‚Äì and unlock his repressed desires for more exotic crossdressing. After Hekate, the Warriors went their separate ways, and Pineapples, sick of being on the dole for Khaos, signed up with the Terran Empire as a professional hit droid. He gained riches and status as a result, and had to be forcibly recruited into the Warriors when they banded together to take on the Terran super-ship Hellbringer. He joined the Warriors in returning to Mars to help increase the peace between Medusa, the planetary consciousness, and her human settlers. When civil war broke out in the aftermath and the mercenary Shadow Warriors were sent after them, Joe developed a severe rivalry with mercenary and highwayman Dog-Tag ‚Äì caused when Joe foiled one of Dog-Tag's heists, wiped out his gang and caused severe damage to him. Dog-Tag got revenge when he shot Joe through the head, buried him and removed his trigger finger. Due to techniques learned from Deadlock, Joe survived the attack ‚Äì having shut down his brain to near-death levels ‚Äì and was able to kill his rival. =Blackblood= Blackblood is a former Volgan war robot forcibly recruited into the Warriors. A master tactician and interrogator, his skills also extend to treachery and betrayal, two things at which he is highly adept. He dislikes Hammerstein intensely, but this is nothing compared to his hatred of Joe Pineapples ‚Äì the robot responsible for his capture. His constant undermining of Hammerstein's leadership has led to many confrontations between the two, and a healthy disrespect that has spanned the centuries. He is currently a member of the Church of Judas, a religion for robots who have betrayed their masters and pray to Judas to take away the guilt. The 2011 Savage story Secret City would retcon that Blackblood was originally a whole series of Volgan robots, a counterpart to the Allied Hammersteins. The Blackblood Mark Ones came online in 2009 and were only crudely sentient; they were programmed to dismember and behead their enemies, to ensure Allied robots would be fully disabled (and without any reprogramming when they were sent against humans), and with no ability to distinguish friend from foe. Bill Savage discovered their field trials in the Midlands' Zone of Alienation.2000 AD progs 1744-5 Decades later, the Volgan scientist Dr Zakaroff sought to create a robot warrior capable of treachery but initially failed to do so with Blackblood. In desperation, Zakaroff turned to the occult, and used a mixture of black magic and science to harness the betrayal of two lovers he forced to torture each other. Blackblood went on to prove his newly discovered treachery by killing Zakaroff, having one of his eyes shot out in the process. He left the socket empty as a reminder of his greatest act of betrayal. During the Volgan War he led the Straw Dogs, experts in jungle warfare and terror tactics, and was rumoured to drink the oil of dead ABC Warriors. He was also responsible for trying to stop Joe Pineapples and Zippo after a failed hit on General Volkhan, causing the remote self-destruction of hundreds of foreign robots in the attempt. He would also root out internal enemies, such as robot designers Mikhail and Marina Zhigunov; he viciously tortured one of their subordinates to uncover the truth, shot the Zhigunovs dead, and attempted to kill their daughter Lara before being temporarily deactivated by partisans. Later on, assisting Volklhan, he used the Zhigunov's virus to infect Steelhorn and cause the Warrior to begin murdering civilians and allies.2000AD prog 1602 He also developed an obsession with discovering the secret enemy officer \\"General Public\\", due to a misunderstanding. Realising his skills in guerrilla warfare would be a valuable asset, Colonel Lash ordered Hammerstein to hunt down Blackblood and forcibly recruit him; Joe Pineapples took him down by shooting him through the heart, and his worst excesses were then removed by brain surgery. He was then sent on the Mars mission. After Mars, little is known of Blackblood's activities. He eventually turned up on the free robot planet of Mekka, where he plied a trade as a 'business man' under the name Bunyon Snipe, selling addictive software to robots; he married an exotic dancer, Ruby Yum Yum Gluck, and still drank the oil of other robots. He also came into possession of certain negatives of Joe Pineapples at a party and was using them for blackmail purposes. He would eventually be forcibly recruited by Nemesis the Warlock into the newly re-formed ABC Warriors, fighting against the Terminators before heading into the Time Wastes. He and the other Warriors went on to repair the damage done to the Time Waste's Black Hole Control Room and save Terra from destruction. During the mission, Blackblood yet again proved his treachery knew no bounds as he betrayed the Warriors to the Eternal Soldiers of Agartha, and then assisted Deadlock in a sabotage attempt to stop The Warriors completing their task. It was during this foray into the Time Wastes that Blackblood lost his leg; he killed a road crew and took their road drill as a substitute. Following this, he and the rest of the Warriors briefly helped Deadlock attempt to spread Khaos throughout the galaxy; Blackblood loved this job due to the bloodshed involved, and the influence of Khaos on the Warriors allowed him to be more murderous and sadistic. Leaving the Warriors again after tiring of Deadlock's command (due to the Khaos influence), Blackblood set up an arms dealership and even took on a pet dog, while torturing a trapped Hammerstein for five years (he happily sent photos of it to every other Warrior). When Hammerstein got free and reformed the Warriors again, Blackblood was forced to sign up on threat of death. He returned to Mars to help keep the peace between the human colonists and the planetary consciousness, Medusa ‚Äì though he stated he had his own reason for doing so, which were soon to become apparent. In the battle against the Shadow Warriors (who he respected for their brutality), Blackblood faced off against the Rev, head of the Church of Judas, and killed him in a vicious battle. Most recently, he permanently alienated Mongrol after it was revealed that he tried to kill his beloved Lara during the war. Even this paled to nothing when he informed an institutionalised Mek-Quake that the ABCs were permanently replacing him, leading to the embittered bulldozer engineering a jailbreak for the Volgan war criminal Volkhan, incarcerated at the same asylum. Blackblood defected from the team at a crucial point in their attempt to rescue Zippo in Marineris City, joining Volkhan's rebellion as his right-hand man. Volkhan and Blackblood escaped and went into hiding after their attempt to destroy the ABC Warriors failed, but with his true colours now firmly revealed, it's a certainty that they are only biding their time until the next attempt. =Mongrol= The immensely strong Mongrol was originally commander of an ABC paratrooper platoon, and the only survivor (save Zippo) of the disastrous drop into Volgan territory at Vilnus ‚Äì so disastrous it was nicknamed Zarnhem after Arnhem.2000AD Prog 1520: The Volgan War Only his head remained undamaged and remained on the battlefield. A scavenger named Lara, daughter of executed robot manufacturers, salvaged his head and built him a new body with other robot parts as an act of defiance against the Volgans. She was caught and executed, and Mongrol was tortured by electricity for information ‚Äì this inadvertently activated his body and he broke free of his captors. The torture and Lara's death reduced him to near animal-like behaviour (\\"Mongrol smush!\\"), and he was regarded as a threat by both sides. He was recruited when Hammerstein earned his respect by beating him in hand-to-hand combat. Mongrol's belief that he would go to heaven and meet his beloved Lara once more became the driving force of the metal ape. After being told by Deadlock that only good robots go to heaven, he became determined to live a hero's life and see his beloved again. After the Mars mission, he found work with P.T. Bar-Num's 'Death Circus' on the free robot planet Mekka. He played the part of The Gawk, a giant metal monster that would be defeated by the heroic Spar- Tekus in every show. So long had he been playing that role, even he sometimes forgot who he really was. He was found by Nemesis the Warlock and brought back into the ranks of The ABC Warriors to help save the Gothic Empire from a Terminator invasion. He was then dispatched with the other Warriors into the Time Wastes of Termight to repair the damage done to it. During their journey, Blackblood broke the news to Mongrol that robots simply go to the smelter rather than heaven, so he would never see Lara again. As a result, Mongrol turned to his 'father' ‚Äì a screwdriver. After saving Terra from destruction, Mongrol followed the others to the planet Hekate, to collect the seven heads needed for the ritual that would spread Khaos throughout the Terran Empire. Mongrol was freed of the power of speech, but as compensation was bestowed with the instant reactions and speed of a natural born beast. After completing their mission on Hekate, Mongrol left for the Temple of the Night Maras with Morrigun, and became nothing more than her mindless (and overly protective) pet. Both he and his 'mistress' joined The ABC Warriors again to take on the Terran super weapon Hellbringer. On the return to Mars, Mongrol's body was destroyed, forcing him to relocate his positronic brain into his new body. This reactivated long-dormant circuits, giving him back his original intelligence (and a taste for cigars). He is still suffering from deep-seated issues over Lara, and when her memory was mocked by the Shadow Warrior Warmonger, Mongrol ripped him to pieces.2000AD Prog 1484: The Shadow Warriors Book 3 Following Blackblood's recounting of his Volgan War experiences and the revelation that he tried to kill Lara, Mongrol went berserk and stated that, at the end of that mission, either Blackblood leaves the Warriors or he will. However, Blackblood had already set things up so Mek-Quake would free Volkhan from Broadband Asylum, and he would go on to abandon the ABC Warriors mid- battle and rejoin Volkhan's army, gleefully slaughtering civilians once more and trying to kill the ABC Warriors. He is currently at large, an enemy of the Warriors once more. =Steelhorn / The Mess= An elite droid built from indestructible alloys, Steelhorn was proclaimed as a hero to the West and seen as one by Volgan civilians whom he liberated, even possessing a secret underground base. Due to his Vortex Hammer weapon, the Volgans viewed him as a war criminal, and so Volkhan and Blackblood infected him with a computer virus that caused him to start massacring civilians and fellow Warriors. Zippo eventually stopped Steelhorn and the virus was deleted, and the massacres were covered up by the military ‚Äì but he was left traumatised and disillusioned by what he'd done.2000AD Progs 1601-4 Steelhorn eventually ended the Volgan War by killing the Volgan Marshall. Following the war, he went to a demob camp to be reprogrammed for civilian life, believing he would become a fireman and save lives, only to find himself falling into a fusion furnace ‚Äì which were being used to kill the ABC Warriors now victory was over. With his dying breaths, Steelhorn cursed humans for their treachery. He survived the furnace but his body was reduced to a bubbling mess. Consumed with hatred, the Mess slaughtered the human responsible before escaping. Hammerstein, realising it was actually Steelhorn, saved the Mess and had him poured into a vacuum flask that would be carried by Mongrol. The metal ape was the only one who could understand what the Mess was trying to say. The Mess would be taken on the Mars mission. On Mars, the Warriors encountered a giant robot called George, one of the original Garganteks ‚Äì giant robots who had originally helped terraform Mars for human colonisation. Because of his size, each of George's limb was controlled by a separate brain, with a master brain supposedly in charge. The Mess ended up inside George, using its liquid state to connect George's brains and turn him into a fearsome fighting machine. When the Mars mission was complete, George and the Mess remained behind. Centuries later, continued terraforming awoke Medusa, the planetary consciousness, and caused her to try to wipe out humanity. She destroyed George for the crime of terraforming her and discovered the Mess as a result; finding it shared her hatred of humans, she rebuilt it into a new incarnation of Steelhorn. He now possessed certain psychic powers allowing him to control Martian wildlife. He became Medusa's voice, organising the attacks on the human settlements and personally leading the slaughter at Viking City, which saw almost the entire population massacred by a Martian born virus. The ABC Warriors fought the new Steelhorn and eventually struck a deal with him and Medusa, agreeing to peaceful coexistence if human President Cobb was transformed into a Martian. Steelhorn re-joined the ranks of The ABC Warriors in place of the deceased Morrigun, in a bid to increase the peace on Mars after Cobb's transformation sparked a civil war. Travelling with them to New Sidona to fend off Confederacy soldiers, Steelhorn was taken out by the rival Shadow Warriors, melted to a sludge once more. Due to occult activities by Deadlock, he was reborn again in a diamond form and brought about the ABC Warriors' victory. He has two horns, one which when played incites wildlife to rebel. He has not said what the other will do, but it is to be played in the event of a Confederate victory and the consequences would presumably be devastating. =Mek-Quake= Mek-Quake is a dim-witted and sadistic former demolition droid. Serving mainly as comic relief, he was originally a member of Ro- Busters, used for internal discipline within the rescue squad (mainly by destroying troublemakers), and did not join the Warriors until their later phase. In the 2010 Savage Book VI: Crims story, Mek-Quake has a cameo appearance destroying compromised Hammersteins in 2009 (which makes him both the oldest Warrior and the oldest AI robot).Prog 1689 His original body was that of a very large bulldozer, seen throughout the run of Ro-Busters. When he reappeared in Book III of Nemesis the Warlock, fighting for the evil Termight empire, his (tiny) brain was now housed in a colossal siege robot with a head vaguely resembling a cat's. Despite his enormous destructive power, his stupidity ultimately ended up making the situation even worse for the Terminators. In Book IV of Nemesis, he returned to his original body; he later switched between this and a vaguely humanoid body stolen from a defeated opponent, depending on the requirements of each mission. Despite initially fighting against them, Mek-Quake was recruited to the Warriors by Nemesis, who realised that his insatiable appetite for mayhem and near-indestructibility made him a useful asset ‚Äì as well as the fact that his limited intelligence and considerable survival instinct meant he had no loyalties except to whichever side would give him the most opportunity to destroy things. For 'Black Hole', Mek-Quake's bulldozer body was redesigned as a heavily armed 'killdozer', with a prehensile neck and a 'face' with a permanent angry scowl. The killdozer body was blown up in 'The Clone Cowboys', leaving him in humanoid form. Depending on the artist, this ‚Äì the current ‚Äì version of Mek- Quake has ranged from five to fifteen feet tall, though generally he is drawn as the largest of the Warriors. What Mek-Quake lacks in intelligence (which is a lot) he makes up for in cruelty and destructive force. However, he is also something of a coward, preferring softer targets that he can inflict more pain upon while chanting his catchphrase: \\"Big jobs!\\" He has no compunctions about massacring humans, evidenced in The Third Element when he is annoyed about having missed most of a battle because of the time it took to remove all the \\"human gristle\\" clogging his caterpillar tracks. In his early stories he openly loathed Hammerstein and Ro-Jaws (as a result of their time in Ro- Busters), but later this hatred was toned down to a general dislike of everything and everybody except videos of chainsaw torture. Despite this Mek- Quake is eager to show his intelligence and importance, and in Kronicles of Khaos he kept trying to join in at the end of Deadlock's statements so he could seem like he was already versed in Khaos. He continued to be part of the Warriors in their return to Mars as they tried to keep the peace during a civil war, developing an interest in conspiracy theories and rap music, but it was clear that his increasing mental instability was putting the rest of the team in danger. After the defeat of the Shadow Warriors, Mek-Quake was checked into a robot asylum by the others. While Hammerstein seemed sad to see his former enemy depart, the others appeared more than eager to meet his replacement, Zippo. Mek-Quake was assigned to clean the cell of former Volgan General Volkhan ‚Äì but when Blackblood called up to gleefully tell him he was going to be replaced, an embittered Mek-Quake freed Volkhan and his associates and helped kill the asylum staff. He then joined with Volkhan and Blackblood in an attempt to destroy the rest of the ABC Warriors, as well as Marineris City. When the rebellion failed and he was abandoned to his fate by Volkhan's troops, Mek-Quake managed to escape destruction with Steelhorn's fusion hammer and unwittingly found himself a celebrity in the Union of Martian Free States for the destruction of the Marinus Red House. After promoting his book tour, Mek-Quake has found employment as Howard Quartz's bodyguard, and was most recently responsible for murdering Tubal Caine's adopted son. =Ro-Jaws= Ro-Jaws was involved in a number of the ABCs adventures, acting largely as comic relief. A working-class sewer droid with filthy habits and a love of refuse, he was originally a law-abiding robot until he was thrown in jail for taking a sick homeless man into a Cabinet minister's house (believing the minister to be a friend). The abuses in robot prison, as well as mixing with criminal robots, caused Ro-Jaws to develop a crude, disrespectful and anarchic attitude, gaining an interest in robot rebellion. (He assisted robot resistance agents but was considered too silly-looking) He was briefly owned by a rich family as a companion for their daughter Annabel; the two became great friends, and it is unknown how that ended. It is known from the first Ro-Busters that he hit his master (unknown if this was Annabel's father), putting him in the hospital, and that was why he was thrown away. He first met Hammerstein when they were both \\"Second Hand Bargains\\" at a robot shop, and the two were bought by the Ro-Busters disaster agency. The two clashed repeatedly due to their differing personalities but would develop a strong sense of friendship. In one incident, they went undercover to investigate murders on a space station, and Ro-Jaws discovered it was the work of robots who were planning a rebellion; Ro-Jaws found the uprising was being secretly directed by humans, and noted he'd have joined the uprising if it had been run by robots. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein were eventually forced to go on the run when they were nearly killed for the insurance money, and helped a number of robots escape Earth to the robot free world Saturn Six; they threw away the chance to make it to Saturn Six themselves by staying behind to cover the escape. They then went underground with new identity papers, singing together as they went off they'd always be \\"walking along side by side\\".2000AD Prog 103‚Äì115, Ro-Busters: The Rise and Fall of Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein Many centuries in the future, Ro-Jaws was working in a hotel in the Gothic Empire and ended up as a valet for Nemesis the Warlock. Ro-Jaws swiftly became a trusted aide and was reunited with Hammerstein in the process, encouraging Nemesis to save his old friend from execution. His brief turn as an official ABC warrior occurred when Nemesis despatched the warriors into the Time Wastes to repair the damage done by his son Thoth; when Terri was inducted into the warriors early into the subsequent Black Hole mission, Ro-Jaws cheerfully gave up this position, although continued to be a hanger-on for some time. He remained for the Hekate mission and quickly got to grips with Khaos. Following the mission, he left the team with Deadlock to work at the Kollege of Khaos ‚Äì Deadlock considers Ro-Jaws to understand the nature of Khaos even better than he does. He views Hammerstein as a good friend, despite their wildly different personalities, and has several times ensured the soldier's life was saved. In a flashback to the Ro-Busters days, it was him who ensured a temporarily rampaging Hammerstein was taken down non-lethally before Mek-Quake reached and killed him;2000AD Annual 1983, Ro-Busters: Ol' Red Eyes Is Back! he worked to convince Nemesis to prevent his execution in The Gothic Empire; and in Khronicles of Khaos he asked Deadlock if he could turn Hammerstein into a more Khaotic person, believing it would be beneficial to him. However, in a contradictory moment in Hellbringer, Ro-Jaws (like everyone else) was shown to have known Hammerstein was being tortured by Blackblood but had no interest in helping him. In 2010 he returned in The Volgan War Book 4, revealed to have been hiding out on Mars (as a public toilet cleaner) under the alias \\"U-Fox\\" and helping Zippo in his resistance activities. As U-Fox, he'd racked up a reputation as an outlaw graffiti artist. He assisted the Warriors against Volkhan and his armies, distracting Mek-Quake with a series of 'your mother' jokes and leading the bulldozer away from the larger battle. Afterwards, he remained in Marineris City. Ro-Jaws also served as the \\"host\\" for a series of short one-off strips, under the title Ro-Jaws Robot Tales. In 2006, he was a central figure in a tribute poster to deceased letterer Tom Frame, sharing a drink with the robot representing Frame. =Other members= Up until Blackblood's defection in 2010, there had always been a 'core five' in the ABC Warriors ‚Äì Hammerstein, Joe, Deadlock, Blackblood and Mongrol ‚Äì that remained unchanged, excepting the ten years or so when Nemesis the Warlock took the place of Deadlock. Various other characters have occupied the sixth and seventh positions as they became vacant. The two other original members were Steelhorn and Happy Shrapnel; they are also the only ex-members to return, though both in radically different form. Every other former member bar Ro-Jaws and Mek-Quake have been killed in action. Happy Shrapnel/Tubal Caine A crusty and cantankerous veteran with a malfunctioning voicebox that punctuated his sentences with buzzes, Happy was originally a 'combat test dummy' made a little unhinged by the numerous battlefield tests he had been put through. He wielded Kolt 45s stolen from a dead Volgan general and wore clothing taken from dead humans ‚Äì sometimes with parts of the corpses still in them. Killed 'off-camera' in a bar brawl soon after the end of the Warrior's original mission and buried by the others on Mars, it was his death that prompted the others to first go their separate ways. Decades later he was also the reason that the team returned, when they received electronic signals telling them that he was still alive and that the evils they had rid Mars of were returning. The Warriors helped Happy rebuild himself, but he refused to rejoin them. Renaming himself 'Tubal Caine', the former Happy reluctantly agreed to be the Warrior's armourer, refitting and repairing them after their many battles on Mars. He remained neutral until Blackblood defected to Volkhan's army, whereupon the other Warriors asked him once more to join them. Tubal revealed that in his time as a blacksmith, he adopted a child named Tom, who had fallen out with his Humpy brethren after choosing to ignore their outdated beliefs. Tubal was later approached by Howard Quartz with Mek-Quake in tow, demanding that he terminate Volkhan. Refusing to serve Quartz, Quartz activated the ruined robots in Caine's scrapyard, causing them to attack. Despite sustaining severe injuries, Tubal fought off the machines, but was instead attacked by mek-Quake who severed his head. Tom Caine opened fire on Mek-Quake, but his weapon malfunctioned, leaving Mek-Quake open to murder him. The shock of seeing his son murdered and suffering severe damage caused Tubal's system to crash, as Quartz had intended. When he re-activated and re- attached his head, Tubal was restored to default status, becoming Happy Shrapnel again, and no longer a pacifist. Hearing his story, the warriors joined Happy and help him seek vengeance against Quartz. Hitaki Programmed to act like ancient samurai by a Japanese secret society, Hitaki was a comrade of Hammerstein and Mad Ronn in the Terminators. After being thwarted in a suicide mission against the Goth Queen by Nemesis, he was inducted into the newly reformed ABC Warriors. He was beheaded by the Monad at the end of the world; Mek-Quake then crushed his body beyond repair before he could be fixed, killing him. Mad Ronn A bomb-disposal robot during the Volgan Wars, he possessed highly sensitive electronic sensors. He was a Terminator alongside Hammerstein and Hitaki and was sent on the suicide mission against the Gothic Empire, and joined the new ABC Warriors. Ronn died while trying to defuse a Terminator bomb before it killed alien refugees. Terri One of the organic slaves (a \\"Terr-1\\") of the Mekaniks, the single-minded robot guardians of the Black Hole and the Tomb of Emperor Zallin, she grew up believing herself to be a robot, albeit a low-caste one due to being made of flesh. She has attempted to make her mind & body just like her masters, possessing incredible strength and the ability to absorb pain unflinchingly, and believes in logic and recycling. When the Mekaniks murdered her infant son, she turned on them, believing this proved them illogical. She was made the seventh ABC Warrior by Deadlock and developed a strong romantic relationship with Hammerstein, who she believed was the father of her child. The two of them planned to settle down and retire after the Black Hole mission, but she was killed during the battle against the Monad. Morrigun Originally a bar waitress on Hekate before she was drafted, she was an expert at the martial art Nekra Chi and wielded both Moon Flails and Pentangs ‚Äì metal throwing stars powered by Khaos. As a field test, she personally retrieved one of the seven heads for the Khaos ritual. During the mission, she took Mongrol as a pet and left with him afterwards to study with the Khaos priestesses called the Night Maras. She rejoined the Warriors for the Hellbringer mission. She was killed on Mars while trying to save the native Trimorphs from a pogrom, being crushed beyond repair by a tank. Zippo Zippo AKA Agent Orange is a flamethrower unit (\\"a Zippo\\") who formerly served in special forces against the Volgans and reported directly to Colonel Lash. His agenda during the war was enigmatic; sometimes it was to assist the ABC Warriors, whereas in the \\"Zarnhem\\" massacre (a battle deliberately lost by Western officers for propaganda purposes) it was to ensure there were no survivors. He has a habit of inscribing mottoes and messages on the weapons and cigarette lighters of his comrades. He has history with all of the surviving original ABC Warriors, and inscribed messages on most of their weapons. After the war, he eventually ended in Marineris City (\\"Mekana\\") on Mars. Friends of his were killed in anti-robot riots.Prog 1559 He ended up becoming an outlaw, mentored as a graffiti artist by the insane \\"tagger\\" Kroll; he left messages and occasionally took out police officers to eventually provoke an uprising. He was eventually captured by the G-Men, a specialist police unit, while his mentor Kroll was killed. The ABC Warriors rescued him from execution and gave him Mek-Quake's recently vacated place in the team. =Members as of 2014= As of 2014, the current ABC Warriors are Hammerstein, Deadlock, Joe Pineapples, Mongrol, Steelhorn, Zippo and Tubal Caine. Stories =The Mek-nificent Seven= The ABC Warriors (story untitled, 1 episode, art by Kevin O'Neill) Introduces Joe Pineapples and Happy Shrapnel. Hammerstein first comes to the attention of the mysterious Colonel Lash. Retreat From Volgow (1 episode, Brendan McCarthy) Colonel Lash arranges a 'test' for Hammerstein ‚Äì withdrawing tank support when the Volgans reactivate a unit of robots so brutal they were deactivated by their own side for fear of the damage they could cause. Hammerstein defeats and kills 'Old Horney', the first Volgan war robot and so his counterpart to. Lash then reveals part of his mission: he wants Hammerstein and his unit to recruit a number of other robots for a classified mission, beginning with the fearsome Mongrol. Mongrol (2 episodes, Mike McMahon) Hammerstein, Joe and Happy track down the renegade robot Mongrol. Hammerstein realises the only thing Mongrol respects is strength ‚Äì he has to defeat him in combat. This proves easier said than done, but when Volgan forces attack, Mongrol's thirst for revenge against those who killed Lara, his creator, overpowers his urge to fight Hammerstein. The two join forces to defeat the attackers, and the simple-minded behemoth pledges to follow his new master. The Order Of The Knights Martial (2 episodes, Kevin O'Neill and Brett Ewins) Hammerstein's next recruit is Deadlock, Grand Wizard of the Knights Martial. Deadlock has foreseen why Hammerstein has come ‚Äì if he can defeat Deadlock in combat, he will join him ‚Äì but if he fails, Deadlock will claim his life. Despite Deadlock's psychic powers and black magic, Hammerstein wins the duel, and Deadlock reluctantly agrees to join the ABC Warriors. The Bougainville Massacre (2 episodes, Mike McMahon) The Warriors take on the Straw Dog soldiers of ruthless Volgan war robot General Blackblood, crippling their leader's war machine before he can escape. However, Blackblood has taken a child hostage, forcing Joe Pineapples to take the most difficult shot of his career to date: he has to hit Blackblood's 'heart' precisely while not harming the boy. Joe is successful, and Blackblood is captured, a disgusted Hammerstein left wondering what mission could be so important that a butcher like Blackblood has to become part of his team. Steelhorn (2 episodes, Brendan McCarthy) The Volgan War is over, the robot Steelhorn ‚Äì made from almost indestructible materials ‚Äì having killed the enemy leader Marshal Volgow. However, when Steelhorn reports for decommissioning, he is betrayed by his own side. With the war over, the robot soldiers are no longer needed, and Steelhorn is dropped into a fusion furnace that even he cannot withstand. Instead of vaporising, he becomes 'The Mess' ‚Äì an intelligence made from molten metal that is consumed with the desire for revenge against his betrayers. The Mess is stored in a flask (kept by Mongrol) that lets it stay molten, and the seventh ABC Warrior has been recruited, albeit in an unusual form. Mars, The Devil Planet (1 episode, Mike McMahon) Colonel Lash reveals the Warriors' secret mission ‚Äì to travel to the colonised and terraformed planet Mars, where rival corporations are at war over resources, the civilians caught in the middle. They are to bring peace to the planet, by any means necessary. Cyboons (2 episodes, Dave Gibbons) Soya ranchers are driving the Cyboons ‚Äì intelligent genetically altered apes used in the early days of terraforming ‚Äì off their reservation to take over the land. The Warriors try to offer the apes assistance, but their leader Bedlam refuses their help. But when Bedlam's son is murdered by the ranchers, he leads his tribe into an attack. Since the ranchers are armed, it seems like a slaughter ‚Äì but Deadlock and Blackblood had secretly infiltrated the ranchers' camp, disarming their guns. Without their weapons, the ranchers are helpless against the ferocity of the Cyboon attack, and after suffering heavy losses are quick to surrender and leave the Cyboons in peace. The Red Death (2 episodes, Mike McMahon) Called to deal with a ruthless biker gang terrorising Viking City, the Warriors seem to have an easy victory ‚Äì until the frightened, fleeing bikers die almost instantly from a hideous flesh-rotting disease. The disease is native to Mars, and triggered by fear. Tracking the disease to its source, the Warriors find a young boy near a car containing the rotting corpses of his parents. Hammerstein is afraid that the boy will see their bodies, become frightened and die himself ‚Äì and the disease begins to affect even his metal body. Deadlock reveals that the 'boy' actually is a manifestation of the Red Death, Mars itself trying to drive away the human settlers. Hammerstein kills the fake child, and the menace is over ‚Äì for now. Golgotha (3 episodes, Carlos Ezquerra) A popular pastime among the ultra-rich youth of Mars is hunting ‚Äì but instead of animals, they hunt people, while riding on the backs of genetically recreated Tyrannosaurs. The most feared of the dinosaurs is Golgotha, son of Satanus (the monstrous T-Rex that appeared during the 'Cursed Earth' storyline of Judge Dredd, who himself was the son of 'Old One Eye' from another 2000AD series, Flesh), and his sheer bloodlust allows him to overcome the control device meant to keep him in check and escape from the compound, leaving carnage in his wake. The Warriors arrive to hunt down the rogue dinosaur ‚Äì and also to administer justice on Golgotha's owner. For his part in multiple murders, the sentence is death, which is duly carried out. However, the youth's father swears revenge on Hammerstein, and pays Blackblood to betray him. Tracking Golgotha to the city, Hammerstein prepares to kill the dinosaur, but his guns fail to fire and he is attacked. The robot is not defenceless, however, and uses his combat hammer to smash the dinosaur's skull. Mortally wounded, Golgotha plummets from a flyover and is impaled on a spire below. Hammerstein has no proof that Blackblood sabotaged his guns ‚Äì but delivers a beating as a warning that if he ever suspects treachery again, he will kill him. Mad George (3 episodes, Mike McMahon) Features George, a giant, clumsy robot with five brains which disagree with each other. At the close of the story the liquid-metal Mess becomes the living metal 'blood' linking George's brains to create a more cohesive robot. Red Planet Blues (2000AD 1985 annual, Steve Dillon and John Higgins (colours)) Written by Alan Moore, his only ABC Warriors story. The Warriors are hired by a farm owner to protect her land and workers from unknown attackers. During their tenure they establish that the attackers are Martian natives, angry at the farmers smallholding and intrusion on their planet. At the end of the story the farmer is missing, presumed killed, and Hammerstein buries a dead native discovered when searching for the farmer. The ABC Warriors next returned to 2000AD as supporting characters in Nemesis the Warlock Books IV- VI. By the time they returned to starring status in 1988, the line-up comprised Hammerstein, Joe, Blackblood, Mongrol, Mek-Quake and Ro-Jaws. =The End of Time!= (21 episodes, Simon Bisley and SMS; also called \\"The Black Hole\\" in reprints) Sent by Nemesis to stabilise the artificial black and white holes that allow interstellar travel (and enabled the Terran Empire to conquer the galaxy) before they collide and destroy Earth, the Warriors pick up a new member ‚Äì Terri. Although human, she has been raised by the robots and androids guarding the black hole complex ‚Äì the Mekaniks ‚Äì and considers herself to be a robot, and Hammerstein to be her true love. Deadlock also returns to rejoin the Warriors, though Hammerstein is suspicious of his motives ‚Äì the follower of Khaos has more to gain from Earth's destruction than its salvation. As well as the Mekaniks, the Warriors must also face the soldiers of the Empire of this time period, led by the robot-hating Major Savard, as well as the ultimate evil ‚Äì the Monad (which originally appeared in Nemesis the Warlock), a psychic monster formed from the distillation of all human evil that is able to take on any form. The Warriors eventually fight their way to the control room, deep inside the tomb of Emperor Zallin, where Deadlock, Blackblood and Mek-Quake come under attack from automated defence systems. Hammerstein realises the truth ‚Äì the defence systems scan robots to ensure that they are there to protect the tomb, and the three robots have been working to sabotage the mission and ensure Earth is destroyed. Hammerstein, Joe, Mongrol and Terri take on the renegades, but an unwilling truce is forced when Savard's troops ‚Äì and the Monad, disguised in the form of Abaddon, an alien bounty hunter ‚Äì attack. Deadlock uses his dark powers to reach the control room and stabilise the black and white holes, but not before the destruction wrought by the impending collision causes the death of Terri. Deadlock then draws upon the centuries of horror and bloodshed the Warriors have experienced to create a psychic warrior powerful enough to defeat ‚Äì but not destroy ‚Äì the Monad. The Warriors then escape by stealing Zallin's tombship, taking the blame for the devastation and now the most wanted robots in the galaxy. =Khronicles of Khaos= (17 episodes, Kevin Walker) On a mission to infect the Terran Empire with Khaos, Deadlock leads the ABC Warriors to the planet Hekate; here, they will kill seven figures of Order and harvest their heads as part of a ritual. As well as recruiting a new seventh member in Morrigun, the existing Warriors were altered by such close exposure to Khaos magick. Blackblood was able to become more vicious again, Joe was operated on to embrace cross-dressing, Mongrol became a true beast and even Hammerstein was influenced. The Warriors undertake six assassinations in the run up to the lunar alignment known as the Night of the Blood Moon, as well as encountering the bizarre alien lifeforms on this world ‚Äì the primal and Khaotic Night Mara, the Froyds who wander around at night acting out their brutal dreams, and the Phookas who vomit on people as a compliment. In the final battle went up against the Terran Imperial Rottweilers battalion and the reanimated Emperor Zalin. They succeeded in the end, bringing Khaos to the world (and a month-long party) and causing it to spread throughout the Empire. Due to its influence, the Warriors refused to follow Deadlock's orders ‚Äì fully embracing Khaos in the process ‚Äì and Deadlock returned to his Kollege with Ro-Jaws. =Hellbringer= (17 episodes, Kevin Walker) Ten years have passed since the 'Hekate' mission, and the Terran Empire's control has crumbled as a result. The Warriors have gone their separate ways, but assemble once more when the Terrans unveil a new super-weapon designed to undo the Warriors' tide of Khaos ‚Äì the Hellbringer. =The Third Element= The 'Third Element' saga was a story arc made up of five three-part stories. Medusa, the ancient planetary consciousness of Mars, has awoken, and by various means is attempting to purge the planet of the human colonists who are terraforming her. The Warriors return to Mars to 'Increase the Peace' during the so-called Medusa War. Roadkill (1 episode, Kevin Walker) A short one-off 'bridge' story in the special 'Prog 2000' issue, to re-introduce the Warriors for the new century. Zombie bikers are terrorising the Martian highways, and only the Warriors can defeat them. The Third Element (3 episodes, Henry Flint) The Warriors intervene when Terran Biohazard troops attempt to ethnically cleanse the population of a Martian ghetto. Morrigun is destroyed in combat, and Mongrol's original personality is rebooted when the Warriors are forced to relocate their brains into new bodies during the battle, turning him from a growling simpleton to a tough-talking, cigar-smoking soldier. The Clone Cowboys (3 episodes, Liam McCormack-Sharpe) The Warriors arrive at the Martian town of Redemption to investigate the disappearance of its inhabitants. They are ambushed by cloned copies of the humans, which turn into hideous mutants as they strike. An army of Medusa's clones emerge from the town's church, using its bell to create massive sonic vibrations that threaten to destroy the Warriors' brains and literally shake their bodies apart. However, Mek-Quake is immune (thanks to the small size of his brain) and loads up his killdozer body with explosives, ploughing into the church and blowing it ‚Äì and the clones ‚Äì to pieces just after he bails out in his secondary body. Victorious, the Warriors depart ‚Äì but are watched by a mysterious horned figure from a hilltop. The Tripods (3 episodes, Mike McMahon) Taking inspiration from H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Medusa next creates an army of tripods which invade Viking City and begin to massacre the population. The Warriors intervene and battle the tripods, but are stunned when the leader of the army is revealed ‚Äì their old comrade Steelhorn, left behind on Mars centuries ago. Medusa destroyed Mad George for the crime of terraforming her, and found the Mess in the remains. Decoding his memories from the molten metal, she cast a new body for him from special martian alloys and Steelhorn was reborn, now as a crusader committed to fighting for Martian freedom. The battle reaches an impasse, and the Warriors realise that while the fighting raged the entire population of Viking City has been killed by a specially created Martian virus, just as the Martians were killed by Earth bacteria in The War of the Worlds. The Warriors reluctantly retreat, vowing a reckoning with Steelhorn. The Zero Option (3 episodes, Boo Cook) At a remote arctic base, the Warriors battle to stop the release of a bomb that will destroy Medusa utterly. During the battle, Steelhorn attacks again and President Cobb betrays the team in hopes of wiping them out for good. Assault on the Red House (3 episodes, Henry Flint) The Warriors take the battle to Mars President Cobb, but the electronic viruses that Medusa has been plaguing robotkind with begin to take their toll. One by one, the Warriors fall, and after escaping with the President the survivors are forced to bargain with Steelhorn. Deadlock suggests a compromise that will satisfy Medusa, Martiankind and Human alike ‚Äì Cobb can stay in charge, but only after certain modifications have been made ‚Äì the addition of an extra arm, eye and leg to make him a trinary being like other Martians. Thus appeased, Medusa calls off her attacks and returns to her deep slumber ‚Äì the fallen Warriors are reactivated, and Steelhorn rejoins the team to help enforce the new peace. =The Medusa Wars= The Medusa Wars is an original novel written by Pat Mills and Alan Mitchell. Although there are questions about its \\"canonicity\\", it introduces a number of pieces of information by the series comic strip's creators, most of which have yet to be contradicted. The novel tells of the events leading up to the Warriors' return to Mars and retells the story of The Third Element strip. It introduces the troubled marriage of Senator Diaz and Juanita Perez, and we see the latter's relationship with Joe Pineapples develop. We are also witness to the disagreements between President Cobb and Senator Diaz, which lead to civil war. These elements are picked up in the following comic strip, The Shadow Warriors. By placing Roadkill after The Third Element, the novel contradicts the strip. In the comic, Morrigun appears in Roadkill and is killed in The Third Element. In the novel, she dies and then the events of Roadkill are said to have happened (without Morrigun's appearance). Mills has said of the novel: \\"Parts are dramatisations of the comic strip. Notably the Biohazard troopers because they originally had excellent funky black dialogue contributed by my black co-writer on the novel, Alan Mitchell. This was altered at the time by 2000AD editorial without my knowledge and in an inappropriate and uncool way. It made my toes curl it was so wrong. So I thought it was important to put it back the way it should be. I think the text version is much better. Although having said that, I'm sure some perverse fan is now going to say he preferred the comic version. In which case, my response would be I'm sure you enjoy McDonalds burgers, too.\\" =The Shadow Warriors= Book I (6 episodes, Carlos Ezquerra) Following the conclusion of the 'Return To Mars' arc, civil war has broken out on the Red Planet. The human population has divided into the Union and the Confederacy. Recognising the threat the ABC Warriors pose to their plans for global domination, the leaders of the Confederacy hire Conflict Management ‚Äì a company of 'privatised peacekeepers' ‚Äì to recruit the Shadow Warriors, a team of robots chosen specifically for their abilities to overcome each member of the Warriors. The first members of the Shadow Warriors to be revealed are Bootleg, a robotic bounty hunter; Dog-Tag, a charming yet ruthless 'pirate' of the trans-Martian highways; The Rev, a minister in the sinister robot religion of the Church of Judas, which Blackblood now follows; and Deus Ex Machina, an artificial intelligence ‚Äì long thought mythical ‚Äì capable of taking control of other machines and turning them to its will. The story opens with Joe severely damaging Dog-Tag and wiping out his gang. The ABC Warriors discover a plot against them and engage Confederacy Behemeks alongside Union forces at Getty City. While Deus Ex Machina sabotages Union gun positions, the Rev attempts to assassinate Deadlock. The ABC Warriors head for New Sidona. Book II (6 episodes, Henry Flint) The Warriors reach New Sidona, where anarchy is breaking out as people wonder whether the Union or Confederacy will get there first. The robots drive off looting Cyboons before encountering a Talk Cone ‚Äì a low-level robot agent of the Total Information Awareness agency that enforces the 'no talking' rule the government requires to monitor the populace for thoughts of terrorism. However, the cone has been booby-trapped with a bomb by Deux Ex, so the Warriors have to act quickly to save a loud group of teenagers from the explosion. Taking the teenagers and fending off more Cyboons, the Warriors encounter the next Shadow Warrior ‚Äì Doctor Maniacus, a rogue paramedic droid who feeds off the pain of his human 'patients' as he tortures and kills them. The psychotic medic unleashes the pain he has absorbed to overload the emotional circuits of the Warriors ‚Äì however, Deadlock, having witnessed horrors beyond imagination in the service of Khaos, is immune. Doc Maniacus is able to fight off the Grand Wizard in single combat, but Deadlock plants a \\"nanobat\\" ‚Äì a microscopic bug ‚Äì on him before he escapes. Meanwhile, sixth Shadow Warrior is revealed to be the sadistic and manipulative Mr Lovebomb, attacks New Sidona with his army of mind-shattered military clones (which undergo psychological torments to produce the adrenaline for military drug Neuropeptide-A). The Warriors reach Terrasand Square, causing Mayor/Sheriff/TIA Chief Terrasand to hurriedly switch his allegiance from the Confederacy to the Union. It turns out the Square is a trap as the Warriors are attacked from all sides by Lovebomb's clones and Deus Ex' cone-bombs. The Warriors try to protect the humans and fight off the clones, while their Shadow counterparts ‚Äì joined by their final member, the state-of-the-art killing machine Warmonger ‚Äì prepare their attack... Book III (10 episodes, Henry Flint) The Shadows attack with state-of-the-art weaponry that is far superior to anything the ABC Warriors have in their arsenal. Steelhorn is the first to fall, reduced to molten slag by Doc Maniacus's 'sledgehammer' shells and trickling into a drain. Joe Pineapples attempts to snipe the Shadows but is caught unawares, shot in the head and buried by Dog- Tag. Realising they are outmatched, the Warriors and the humans they are protecting take shelter in the police precinct and prepare for a long siege. Over the course of a long and protracted battle various Shadows and Warriors fall. Mek-Quake, his already unstable mind affected earlier by Mr Lovebomb's heartbreaker bullets, seems increasingly unhinged. Deadlock locks himself away performing mysterious and sinister rituals on captured Confederate soldiers, refusing to be disturbed. Eventually the Warriors are forced by the imminent arrival of Confederate tanks into the open to face the remaining Shadows. Hammerstein decapitate Maniacus while Blackblood tackles the Rev. Mongrol tears Warmonger apart in a rage when makes the mistake of disparaging Lara. Dog Tag is hit and fatally wounded by his own bullets as it is revealed Joe Pineapples only faked his electronic death, allowing him to loot the Shadows' arsenal. Just as it seems the ABC Warriors have prevailed, Bootleg leads the Confederate Behemeks in demolishing buildings and crushing the ABCs into the ground. However, now the purpose of Deadlock's ritual becomes clear ‚Äì he has bargained with Medusa for Steelhorn's return, this time in a new, impervious diamond-bodied form. Steelhorn wipes out the remaining enemy resistance and the other ABCs join in the attack with the aid of newly arrived Union forces. The Confederate troops are destroyed and the battered ABC Warriors are victorious. =The Volgan War= Volume I (9 episodes, Clint Langley) The Warriors arrive at Broadband Asylum on Mars, a mental hospital for robots, to check in Mek-Quake for treatment. He hopefully asks that his place in the team be kept open for him, but after they leave him the other Warriors make it clear they have no intention of taking him back. Only Hammerstein is bothered by the betrayal, while Blackblood positively revels in it. Travelling to Marineris City to recruit a new member, the robots reminisce about their experiences in the Volgan War. Hammerstein tells of a battle against the fearsome Stalins, colossal war robots. Mongrol describes how his existence as a robo-paratrooper was ended by a faulty parachute, and his rebuilding by Lara ‚Äì before she was murdered by Volgan forces for harbouring him. Joe, meanwhile, recalls an assassination mission where he was sent undercover to Moscow to destroy the 'Ikon', leader of the Volgan robotic forces: the fearsome Volkhan. As the stories progress, it is revealed that all of the Warriors encountered Volkhan in their battles ‚Äì as well as a Special Forces ABC robot called Zippo, who it becomes clear is going to become the latest member of the Warriors. Back at Broadband Asylum, Mek-Quake makes an unexpected discovery ‚Äì one of the other inmates is none other than Volkhan himself... Volume II (10 episodes, Clint Langley) Volkhan tries to convince Mek-Quake to help him escape, but he refuses. That is, until he receives a call from Blackblood, who gloatingly informs him ‚Äì \\"as a friend\\" ‚Äì that his position in the ABC Warriors has been taken by Zippo. Dismayed and enraged, Mek-Quake makes a fateful decision... Still travelling, the other Warriors continue their war memoirs. Blackblood takes glee in describing how he was the one responsible for the murder of Lara's parents, which prompts a furious Mongrol to issue an ultimatum ‚Äì when the mission is completed, either Blackblood leaves the Warriors, or he does. Next, Deadlock relates his encounter with Volkhan, and his destruction of his 'son' Kalevala. Knowing that killing or imprisoning the Ikon will turn him into a martyr, Deadlock instead 'operates' on Volkhan to prevent him from creating any more offspring ‚Äì essentially castrating him. As the Warriors arrive at Marineris to find and rescue Zippo, at Broadband Asylum Mek-Quake kills the guards and frees Volkhan and his comrades. As a reward, Volkhan promises the former demolition droid the chance to carry out \\"the biggest job on Mars.\\" Volume III (10 episodes, Clint Langley) Steelhorn recalls his war memoirs, explaining how he was viewed a modern-day knight by the west, and a war criminal by the Volgans. Volgan agents (Non other than Volkhan and Blackblood) plant a virus into Steelhorn while he slept, that caused Steelhorn to believe he was Volkhans slain son Kal, and proceeded to decimate the western frontlines and the civilian population. Hammerstein witnesses the carnage, losing his legs and his comrades to Steelhorns vortex hammer. Zippo arrives and proceeds to fight Steelhorn, eventually being able to plant an anti-virus which restores Steelhorn, who flees in shame. Horrified by his actions in the war, Steelhorn moves to a de-mobilization centre for reassignment, only to be thrown into a fusion furnace, sparking his hatred of humanity and his transformation into the mess. Zippo now awaiting execution, recalls the events leading to this situation. Prior to his capture, Zippo sprayed anti-government graffiti across the city and dealt with the oppressive police force when required. Zippo meets with his mentor \\"Kroll\\", and discovers that Kroll is being manipulated by Medusa into defacing the city as punishment for creating it. Detective inspector Sturn arrives with a squad of \\"G men\\", killing Kroll and capturing Zippo, bringing him to the police headquarters \\"Der Kran\\". Resisting interrogation, Zippo is sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, Blackblood leaves the warriors and links up with Volkhan and Mek- quake on the martian highway. Volkhan has now assembled a team of loyal servants each with a personal score to settle with the warriors, and gifts Mek-quake with an industrial mobile excavator. They now proceed towards Marineris city obliterating everything in their path. Volume IV (12 episodes, Clint Langley) The Warriors succeed in rescuing Zippo despite Blackblood's disappearance, delivering him to his ally \\"Urban Fox\\" who turns out to be Ro- jaws. Volkhan's approach towards the city leads to a massive uprising of the city's droids, forcing the Warriors to attack Der Kran to force a truce onto the G-men so that they can deal with Volkhan. After fighting through Volkhan's crazed robot hoards, the Warriors engage Blackblood onboard Mek-Quake's excavator. Blackblood gleefully reveals that he has supplied volkhans troops with information on their weaknesses, and has calibrated their weapons to exploit them. Sustaining severe injuries, Steelhorn retrieves the vortex hammer from the museum of war, while Ro-jaws leads Mek-Quake away from the warriors by insulting his imaginary mother, much to Blackblood's annoyance. The Warriors escape while Volkhan leads his forces on the red house. President Diaz, who has been brainwashing Joe Pineapples' former lover Juanita into sleeping with him, orders Sturn to execute the Warriors once they have defeated Volkhan, but instead chooses to evacuate once he hears of the Warriors impending defeat. Juanita, hearing Joe's name, remembers her love for him and undoes Diaz's brainwashing. Diaz attempts to kill Juanita, but Joe arrives and kills Diaz, saving Juanita as the red house is overrun by Volkhan's forces. Steelhorn returns with the vortex hammer, destroying Volkhan's forces with the hammer. Sensing defeat, Volkhan and Blackblood escape while leaving Mek-quake to perish, vowing vengeance. Mek-Quake escapes the excavator via an ejector seat as it is destroyed by the vortex hammer. Immediately after Volkhan's defeat, the G-men attack and prepare to finish off the Warriors. Zippo returns, with upgraded armour and leads a successful counterattack, driving the G-men back to Der Kran. Months later, the Warriors prepare to leave to recruit a new member to fill Blackbloods vacancy. Mek- Quake is found to be publicising his book tour in union territory, while Juanita leaves Joe, needing time to recover from Diaz's brainwashing. As they leave with their newest member (Zippo), Joe reads a thought mail from Blackblood, promising retribution for his defeat. =Return to Earth= (12 episodes, Clint Langley) While attempting to meet with their mysterious armorer Tubal Caine, the Warriors vessel crashes from volcanic ash being sucked into the engine. Initially suspecting Volkhan, they are immediately attacked by tripods upon landing. While certain that this aggression is the work of the planetary consciousness Medusa, her motivations for attacking them remain a mystery. While fixing the engines, Hammerstein reveals his reluctance to return to Earth, revealing what happened prior to him joining Ro-busters. Hammerstein's last journey to earth saw him trying to inform fellow ABC warriors of their future, that they would be recycled instead of being reprogrammed. Despite initial resistance, the warriors eventually believed him and fought their way out of the recycling compound. With the authorities after him, Hammerstein hid at a war memorial, pretending to be part of the memorial via a paint job and an immobiliser. However, the FBI tracked him down and attempted to destroy him, with Hammerstein unable to move. Hammerstein invoked the forces of khaos (Which Deadlock would take credit for) and de-activated the immobiliser and went on the offensive. The other ABC warriors which were part of the memorial also re-activated and aided Hammersteins escape, sacrificing themselves to help him. Meeting in DC with his UN contact, Hammerstein was briefed on his mission. The UN had made a move to completely remove war altogether and install a new method of dealing with conflict, but the Quartz controlled White House was vetoing the vote. Hammerstein's mission was to kill the president, so the vote would swing in the UN's favour. Infiltrating the White House, Hammerstein overcame the secret service and the Hammerstein mk IVs and encountered President Dick Quartz in the oval office. In order to kill him, Hammerstein had to get his ethical conductor, the software which gauges hostile targets to identify Quartz as an enemy. Hammerstein succeeded in getting Quartz to admit to various war crimes committed by the US in the Volgan war, his ethical conductor allowing Hammerstein to kill him. Hammerstein is then greeted by Howard Quartz, who displays little emotion for the death of his nephew. Hammerstein attempts to kill Quartz, but Quartz gleefully reveals that all his machines have a prime directive that prevents them from killing him. Hammerstein escapes and is given a new head by his UN contact, and then placed in a robot emporium, where he would meet Ro-Jaws. While in the emporium, Hammerstein learns that the UN vote was carried, with his UN contact revealed to be an African ambassador, successfully beats Great Britain in trade negotiations via the new method. This new method turns out to be one-on-one armed combat. Hammerstein's story then ends with him and Ro-Jaws reporting to Mek-Quake for destruction, but being recruited into Ro-Busters at the last moment, his new head preventing Quartz from identifying him. With the ship repaired, the warriors depart and meet their mechanic Tubal caine, who Hammerstein reveals is in fact Happy Shrapnel. =Return To Mars= (12 episodes, Clint Langley) This story fills in a lot of the missing backstory of the Warriors since their return to Mars - revealing that their armourer Tubal is former teammate Happy Shrapnel, inadvertently resurrected from the grave hundreds of years after his death by Medusa, when she first woke. Seeing first hand the chaos being wrought by Medusa's plagues of zombies and martians, Happy sent a call out into the universe for the other Warriors, who felt compelled to fulfil their primary directive and return to the Red Planet to restore peace. Happy declined to join them on their return, instead renouncing warfare for the simpler life of a mechanic, and rejecting his 'slave name' in favour of Tubal Caine. After the Warriors' many subsequent battles, it was he who patched them up. In the time that followed his life as a mechanic, Tubal adopted a humpy son named Tom, who resembled a human unlike his humpy family. Tom was in the throes of being executed for heresy when tubal saved him, his crime being that Tom had proven that martian food and plant life was not toxic, but in fact increased a humans physical attributes, a belief that conflicted with Humpy traditions. Tubal was later approached by Howard Quartz with his new bodyguard, Mek-Quake. Quartz explained that he wanted Tubal to terminate Volkhan. Refusing to work for Quartz, Quartz activated the scrap robots in his scrapyard which immediately attacked Tubal. Sustaining severe injuries, Tubal fended off the machines but came under attack from Mek-Quake, who eventually succeeded in tearing off Tubal's head. In an attempt to save Tubal, Tom opened fire on Mek-Quake, but his weapon jammed, allowing Mek-Quake to murder him. The sustained damage and the shock of seeing his son murdered caused Tubal to suffer a system crash, which Quartz had intended. Upon re-activation and re-attaching his head, Tubal was restored to default status, becoming Happy Shrapnel again and no longer a pacifist. Seeing the crime Quartz committed, and receiving news that Quartz was supplying both factions in the martian civil war, the warriors agree that there never can truly be peace on mars as long as Quartz lives. With Happy Shrapnel part of the warriors, the team sets out to kill Quartz. in order to overcome their prime directive which prohibits this, Hammerstein suggests they find Ro-Jaws, the only machine to ever show signs of being able to negate the prime directive. Chronology Although no dates were specified at the time, the 2006‚Äì07 series The Volgan War explicitly places that conflict in 2082‚Äì84, with the invasion of Western Europe in 1999 (from Invasion!) as backstory and considered to be World War III in the ABC timeline. This retcons out the Judge Dredd strip Hammerstein, which placed the ABC Warriors in Dredd's universe and showed Hammerstein involved in 2071's Battle of Armageddon after the Volgan War and the Mars mission. After the Volgan War, the Warriors take part in the original Mars mission and subsequently disband. Hammerstein ends up back on Earth and ultimately joins Ro-Busters. The adventures of the ABC Warriors in Nemesis Books 3 to 6 take place \\"thousands\\" of years later, with Earth having since become Termight, a quasi-mediaeval future society where the knowledge for making robots belongs to the Lost Age of Science. All robots who have lived thus far have become antiquated relics, forced to salvage spare parts from fallen colleagues to survive. Book 6 sees them travel forward billions of years in time to the end of the earth, where they first encounter the Monad. When the Warriors part company with Nemesis in Book 6, they travel back in time (via the time-tubes) to a period slightly prior to Termight ‚Äì the Terran Empire, a much more technologically orientated society ‚Äì for their remaining post-Nemesis adventures. Several centuries have passed since their original mission on Mars by the time they return to the Red Planet for The Third Element arc and all subsequent stories. The Biol corporation is still a major player and Mars' civilisation is largely the same, though enough time has passed for some Martian races, such as the Humpies and Cyboons, to degenerate to a lower state of being. The ABC warriors' original Mars mission has passed into near-legendary status, with most believing the warriors to be long since dead prior their return. A character in Return To Mars mentions having been taught about their adventures in school.

The high ground, which is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, lies between the Stiperstones range to the west and the Stretton Hills and Wenlock Edge to the east. Much of it is owned and managed by the National Trust. The Long Mynd is approximately long by wide, and is broadly characterised by steep valleys on its eastern flanks, and a long slope to the western side rising in a steep escarpment. In its vicinity are the principal settlements of Church Stretton, Little Stretton and All Stretton, Pulverbatch, Smethcott, Woolstaston, Asterton, Myndtown, Wentnor and Ratlinghope. The highest point on the Long Mynd is Pole Bank (); this and the adjacent hill of Caer Caradoc () are classed as Marilyns. Etymology The name Long Mynd means \\"Long Mountain\\", the second element being Brittonic in origin. In modern Welsh it is named Mynydd Hir , which has the same meaning. Geology The geology dates back to the Precambrian, and during at least part of that long period the feature would have been around 60¬∞ south of the equator, the same as the current latitude of the Falkland Islands. Shropshire would have been at the very edge of a large continent near the sea, which was being buckled by tectonic activity, causing volcanoes to form. The area had broad rivers; evidence of mudflats has been found. The rivers would have flowed out to sea, creating large estuaries; over time, the mudflats would have built up, and volcanic eruptions deposited ash in layers between the sand and mud. The primary rock of the Long Mynd is sandstone, usually coloured purple or grey. The volcanoes created the nearby Stretton Hills and the Wrekin, and eruptions would have been frequent. There are layers in the rocks of the Long Mynd that were previously described as raindrop marks. Unpublished research, including electron micrographs, by the now deceased Professor Martin Brasier, showed that these are actually ichnofossils created by an unknown Ediacaran biota. Field observations of the stratigraphy present, and its laminar nature, leave no doubt that they are in a marine environment; the absence of infilled or mineralised syncresis (shrinkage cracks) adds to this. Examples of these fossilised marks can be viewed today in the National Trust Tearoom Exhibition, in Carding Mill Valley. The layers of rock built up over the millennia to create an approximately thick layer composed of sand, mud, silt and very occasional thin ash bands. The stratigraphy, mineral compositions and surrounding volcanology suggests an infilling island arc basin. Towards the end of the Precambrian period, the volcanoes ceased their eruptions, and the rivers had dried up. Instead the forces that created the volcanoes caused the new rocks to lift and fold, creating mountains and valleys in the area. Much of the rock was melted during this period, underneath the Earth's crust, causing the mountains to continually change towards the latter part of the Precambrian. The Church Stretton Fault zone probably formed during this period. It is still active today. The hill Caer Caradoc adjacent to the Long Mynd and from the same time is volcanic in origin, and is thought to be a remnant of the great mountain chain. During the Cambrian, Shropshire was flooded by the sea, after the Global Ice Age ended 545 million years ago. Thick layers of beach pebbles and white sand were built up against the sea cliffs that were once molten lava. During this time, the shallow sea played host to the huge explosion of new life which occurred during the Cambrian. Shropshire has some of the most historically important evidence in the explosion of life and this is referred to in the naming and dividing of the Cambrian period. Trilobites that are found in the county are internationally important for deciding how the Cambrian is divided into smaller segments of time. The Ordovician had Shropshire back to volcanic activity, and saw the county temporarily split in two, along the Pontesford ‚Äì Linley fault line. Everything west of this line was ocean, while the east was dry land. The Iapetus Ocean was closing, bringing the two halves of Britain towards each other, and volcanic eruptions created the Cumbrian Mountains and Snowdonia. Shropshire also saw volcanic activity. To the west of the Pontesford ‚Äì Linley fault, volcanic rocks have been found. The other side of the fault line was quieter. The land was slowly eroded, and the sea gradually flooded it, so that only the tops of hills could be seen, such as the ancient Caer Caradoc. Towards the end of the Ordovician, the sea levels dropped, due to another ice age. An interesting observation of this erosion can be found in the stratigraphy as a sea stump (an eroded sea stack). The Silurian period, around 439 million years ago, has been well preserved nearby, in Wenlock Edge. During this time, Shropshire would have been flooded again by shallow sea. Wenlock Edge would have formed during this time, and the fossils of ancient corals and shellfish can be found all along the edge, preserved in limestone. Towards the end of the Silurian the Iapetus Ocean would have fully closed, and England and Scotland were joined. The closing of this ocean was important to geology in Great Britain. It caused most of our hills and mountains to align along the fault, northeast to the southwest. During the Devonian, the newly formed Scottish mountains had rivers flowing all over the land. Shropshire was no exception; these new rivers caused thick deposits in the area. Most of the rocks from this era are red sandstones, with iron in the rock. The area was known as the Old Red Sandstone Continent. These river sediments have traces of fossilised fish. Shropshire would have remained above water until the end of the Devonian, when the seas rose once again. The Carboniferous was a time of great change for the area. Shropshire would have been near the equator, and the Old Red Sandstone continent had been eroded away; in the early part of the era, the county was under a shallow sea. However, tectonic activity pushed Britain out of the sea. South of Shropshire this effect was felt greatly, though Shropshire was relatively quiet. Mountains to the north were being worn down by rivers, creating enormous deltas that were colonised by plant life. A tropical forest took hold all over Shropshire, with ancient tree ferns and horsetails. Shropshire eventually crossed the equator during this era, and became a part of Pangaea during the Permian; the area would have been very similar to the Sahara Desert, and would have been in the vicinity, around 20¬∞ to 30¬∞ north of the equator. The Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary were very quiet in Shropshire, and very little evidence can be found from these periods. The last Ice Age during the Quaternary has its effect on all of Shropshire, shaping the landscape as we see it today. The Long Mynd would have been under a thick ice sheet, several hundred metres thick. As the ice melted, it carved out the valleys and hills of the Long Mynd massif we see today. The small rivers, streams and brooks still very slowly carve out the valleys. Today the steep and narrow valleys are covered in a thin layer of acidic soil, able to support only strong grasses, rushes and heathers. Beneath the soil the evidence of the ancient and chequered past can be seen, and the rocky outcrops and scree slopes are excellent places to view the different layers of ancient rock. From 2006, University of Cambridge scientists monitored seismic activity in the Long Mynd. The broadband seismometer was connected to the internet, and real-time traces viewable online.Long Mynd seismometer History View from Pole Bank looking north Wild Moor during wintry conditions Barristers Batch on the eastern flank of the Long Mynd Long Mynd seen from below at Little Stretton =Bronze Age= The Bronze Age period is by far the most recorded period of time on the Long Mynd. There are dozens of tumuli on the moorland. Some are small, the remains of chamber tombs for example. Others are quite large, the sites on the Long Mynd, from the Bronze Age, include dykes and barrows. Barristers Plain Cross-Ridge Dyke runs southwest to northeast, almost in a straight line for . It runs across the narrowest area of a ridge between Grindle Hill and Round Hill. The remains of the dyke is now covered in heather, and is approximately wide, and is high. On its western side it is fronted by a wide ditch. At both ends of the Cross Ridge Dyke, it fades into the steep hillside. A gap in the dyke, from the south-east end, is thought to make room for a trackway along the ridge. Its purpose was to cut off Grindle Hill from the main plateau, and to create a barrier for access from the west. Devil's Mouth Cross-Ridge Dyke lies between Cardingmill Valley and Townbrook Valley. The dyke is long, but is cut though by the Burway road and a small car park, of the dyke is now missing. Both ends of the dyke end on steep slopes! It was built with stone and earth, and is wide, and high, with shallow ditches either side. It is roughly 1,500 years old. It was probably built to control the access along the ancient east to west route, which still crosses the Long Mynd today by means of a modern road. High Park Cross-Ridge Dyke, another dyke on the Long Mynd. At it is the longest on the Long Mynd. It is approximately wide, but in areas survives only as a crop mark. The highest point of the dyke, on the west side of the bank, stands at high, and reaches its widest point at . A trackway, like that found on Barristers Plain Cross-Ridge Dyke, cuts through the dyke. Of the Long Mynd Barrows, over twenty scatter the plateau. The best examples are in the northern area of the Long Mynd. Robin Hood's Butts barrow, near Duckley Nap, are two well known barrows, and the largest on the Long Mynd, being approximately in diameter and high. The Shooting Box Barrow is named after a grouse-shooting hut that stood on the site until it was removed in 1992. It is the only known example of a disc barrow in Shropshire. in diameter and high, it is in the centre of a flat circular enclosure in diameter, the edge of which is defined by a wide bank, which has been partially destroyed by a modern path. It had been dated to 1950‚Äì1700 BC. The Port Way is an ancient trackway, which runs the length of the Long Mynd massif, and is the largest historical feature on the Long Mynd, at just over long. It is still walked today, and is part of the Shropshire Way, and a road that goes to the Gliding Club. A common misconception is that it goes over Pole Bank, but instead it bypasses the hill, following its contours. =Iron Age= Very little Iron Age human activity has been recorded on the Long Mynd. However, this later period has a specific ancient site. Bodbury Ring Hill Fort, a hill fort above Cardingmill Valley, and sits on the top of Bodbury Hill at . This feature dates from the Iron Age, 500 BC, and is therefore much later than other ancient sites on the Long Mynd. Another hill fort nearby sits on the summit of Caer Caradoc. Bodbury Ring is now looked after by the National Trust. =18th century= During the 18th century, Church Stretton began to grow in the wide valley between the Long Mynd and Caer Caradoc, as a market town, and later a spa. Historically the town was known for its textiles, specifically in Cardingmill Valley. Carding Mill was built in the 18th century, and named after a stage in making cloth, the three stages being carding, spinning and weaving. Carding would have been done by children, and involved using a hand-card that removed and untangled short fibres from the mass of raw material. The cards were wooden blocks with handles and covered in metal spikes, which were angled, (to make it easier to untangle) and set in leather. When untangled, the material would be spun, and then weaved into the final product. The mill is still in the valley today, but has been converted into luxury apartments. The Long Mynd Hotel in Church Stretton was built in 1900, originally as the Hydro, at a time when the town was popular as a spa. =20th century= A large area of the Long Mynd (almost all its upland area) was bought by the National Trust in 1965, and was designated an AONB as part of the Shropshire Hills in 1958. Highest points Ashes Hollow towards Pole Bank The Long Mynd comprises many hills and moors. From the summit of nearly every hill, there are extensive views of the surrounding area and surrounding counties. North, one can see as far as Cheshire; west commands views over the Stiperstones, and the Welsh Cambrian Mountains in Powys, notably the Cambrian and Berwyn Mountains, and as far as Snowdonia on clear days. The views east are obscured by other areas of the Shropshire Hills, Caer Caradoc, the Wrekin and the Clee Hills. From some locations there are views of the West Midlands. Views south show the Clun Forest, and towards the Craven Arms and Ludlow. The highest points on the Long Mynd are as follows in order of highest to lowest, with comparisons of other nearby hills and the level of Church Stretton in bold. *Brown Clee Hill *Stiperstones *Pole Bank *Long Synalds *Wild Moor *Calf Ridge *Haddon Hill *Yearlet *Round Hill *Caer Caradoc *Grindle *Knolls *Minton Hill *Cow Ridge *Packetstone Hill *Nills *Ashlet *Black Knoll *Callow *The Wrekin *Burway Hill *Churchmoor Hill *Bodbury Hill *Priors Holt Hill *Adstone Hill *Shooters Knoll *Stanyeld *Novers Hill *Castle Hill *Church Stretton Valleys, hollows and batches Long Mynd comprises a multitude of valleys and the highest concentration lies along the eastern edge, near Church Stretton.

Schleicher ASK 21 glider being bungee launched from the Long Mynd Long Mynd is part of the Shropshire Hills designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and is a popular tourist destination, particularly due to the many footpaths, varied terrain and impressive scenery and views. Two major footpaths are the Shropshire Way and the Jack Mytton Way. The Long Mynd's open spaces make it a popular place for horse riding and mountain biking on the bridleways. Cardingmill Valley is the busiest location as it is home to the National Trust's centre for the area. The windward slopes to the west are popular with glider, hang-glider and paraglider pilots. In winter some valley slopes become makeshift ski slopes, but Long Mynd can be treacherous in severe weather, and has claimed many lives. In 2015 snow gates were installed at various points of access onto the Long Mynd, to deter motorists planning to use the routes in wintry conditions.BBC News Long Mynd snow gates are working (3 February 2015)Evesham Journal Regional: Snow gates installed at the Long Mynd (23 January 2015) The Longmynd Hike is a competitive race that crosses over the Long Mynd twice and must be completed in under 24 hours. It has been running since 1967 and takes place annually, usually on the first weekend in October. There is a golf course, the Church Stretton Golf Club, located near the Cardingmill Valley, on the slopes of Stanyeld Hill and Bodbury Hill. The clubhouse is at approximately above sea level and the hilly links course rises up to around 375m (1,230 ft). It is the oldest 18-hole golf course in Shropshire, opened in 1898, and one of the highest in the country. =Gliding= The Long Mynd has been home to the Midland Gliding Club since 1934. The club owns of land on the south end and flies gliders there throughout the year. It runs residential training courses and offers members of the public trial lesson flights. Many long flights have started from the Long Mynd, most recently one of during the summer of 2007. The gliding club is one of the few remaining clubs in Europe to regularly launch gliders by bungee. Flora and fauna Historical grazing rights are held by the Long Mynd Commoners which have 48 ponies on the land. The horses slow the invasion of trees by pushing into the scrub and bracken helping to maintain the heath. They also graze in the pools, eating the pondweed and consequently there is a healthy population of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and otter (Lutra lutra). Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) are found here as well as the recent arrival of the grayling butterfly (Hipparchia semele). Popular culture The Revd E. D. Carr's A Night in the Snow describes his experience, in 1865, of surviving a winter's night on the Long Mynd when attempting to walk home after conducting a Sunday service and visiting an isolated parishioner. He spent 23 hours struggling to force a route to safety. The Long Mynd features in literature in the poetry of A. E. Housman, the novels of Mary Webb (in particular Gone to Earth) and Malcolm Saville's Lone Pine series for children.

History of Newfoundland ferry services From 1851, when the Colony of Newfoundland took over the operation of the post office, the government contracted for packet boats. By 1860 subsidized schooners were operating on the northeast coast from Greenspond to New Perlican, and along the south coast from Placentia to Channel-Port aux Basques. The first steam-packet, Lady LeMarchant, operated on Conception Bay after 1852. In 1860 the government decided to subsidize a regularly scheduled steamer service. The first vessel chartered to the service was the Victoria in 1862. In 1863 Ariel took over, alternating a northern run to Twillingate (later extended to Tilt Cove) with a southern run to LaPoile. In 1871 Grieve and Co. replaced Ariel with Leopard and Tiger, inaugurating northern and southern runs based at St. John's, to Battle Harbour in the north, and to Halifax in the south. After 1877 the two-steamer coastal service continued with Bowring Brothers' Curlew and Plover, while Lady Glover ran in Conception Bay. In 1888 Harvey & Co. took over the service, with Conscript (on the northern service) and Volunteer. The packet Hercules, then later Alert, began running in Placentia Bay, while Favourite ran in Trinity Bay and Lady Glover in Notre Dame Bay. Once the railway reached Harbour Grace there was no need for a steam-packet on Conception Bay. After Volunteer was lost in 1891, Harvey's commissioned Grand Lake and renamed Conscript the Virginia Lake. Meanwhile, Farquhar's Harlaw served western Newfoundland, out of Halifax. With its completion of the Newfoundland Railway in 1898 and following its agreement with the Newfoundland Government, the Reid Newfoundland Company under Robert G. Reid began operating coastal and ferry services for the island and Labrador, to be integrated with the railway. By 1900 they comprised a fleet of eight vessels known as the \\"Alphabet Fleet.\\" Each vessel in the Alphabet Fleet was built in Scotland and given the name of a Scottish location by the Reids, who were of Scottish ancestry. In 1904, in response to complaints about the Reid service, the Newfoundland government subsidized the use of two outside vessels for the coastal service, the Portia and Prospero, and in 1912, set up a similar arrangement for use of the Sagona and Fogota. In 1923, under the Railway Settlement Act, the government took over the island's railway. They purchased the Alphabet Fleet from the Reids and placed it under the railway's control. In 1924, the Portia, Prospero and Sagona were purchased outright, and another vessel, the Malakoff, was brought into service. In 1925, the began its service on the Gulf run. The Newfoundland Royal Commission, formed in 1933 by the government of Great Britain to examine the future of Newfoundland in light of its then financial difficulties, examined the operation of ferries as part of its investigation. It recommended that an expert inquiry be held into the ferry services with a view particularly to the prevention of overlapping, more efficient and economical working and the readjustment of freight rates on a carefully planned and scientific basis. After Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949, the Newfoundland Railway and its ferry services became part of the Canadian National Railway. In 1977, CN's marine operations in Atlantic Canada were passed to a subsidiary, CN Marine. Formation of Marine Atlantic Marine Atlantic was established in 1986 to take over the provision of ferry services in Atlantic Canada which had previously been operated by CN Marine, a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway. Its headquarters were in Moncton, New Brunswick. Extensive budget cuts by the Government of Canada during the latter part of the 1990s led to a drastic downsizing of Marine Atlantic's operations, precipitated by the 1997 opening of the Confederation Bridge which replaced Marine Atlantic's most heavily used ferry service, the constitutionally-mandated ferry to Prince Edward Island. Later in 1997, the company transferred the operation of its Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine ferry services between Saint John, New Brunswick-Digby, Nova Scotia and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia-Bar Harbor, Maine to the private-sector company Bay Ferries Limited, a subsidiary of Northumberland Ferries Limited. That year also saw Marine Atlantic remove itself from the provision of coastal ferry services in Newfoundland and Labrador with the transfer of operations to the provincial government at the end of the 1997 shipping season. This agreement was reached between the federal and provincial governments in exchange for federal funding to extend regional roads such as the Trans-Labrador Highway to service coastal communities. These coastal ferry services had been initiated by the Newfoundland Railway and were assumed by Canadian National Railways, following the province's entry into Confederation in 1949, although they were not constitutionally mandated. Also in 1997 Marine Atlantic sold off its Newfoundland Dockyard, located in St. John's, Newfoundland to a private operator. The dockyard built in the 1880s was at one point in time owned by the Reid Newfoundland Company, then in 1923 was taken over by the Newfoundland Railway company. when Newfoundland joined Canada ownership passed to Canadian National. In 1998, the company moved its headquarters from Moncton to St. John's, after briefly considering North Sydney and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador. In late 2004, the federal government announced the appointment of a three-member committee tasked with examining future operations of Marine Atlantic. One of the options that was reportedly considered included privatization, however the subsequent report called for improved service through fleet renewal, lower fares, increased frequency of crossings, and moving the headquarters to Port aux Basques. In 2010, Marine Atlantic announced that the Canadian government was planning to invest around $900 million in the ferry operations. Two ferries, the and the , were replaced by newer ships initially chartered from Stena Line. On land, all three terminals at Marine Atlantic's ports received extensive renovations, including the construction of a new terminal building at the North Sydney facility. Historical fleet Marine Atlantic inherited numerous vessels from CN Marine in 1986, all of which have since been removed from service. Many of these vessels have gone through numerous ownership changes and, given their advanced age, most have been scrapped. ;Cabot Strait * (scrapped) * (sold, scrapped) * (sold, renamed Ana; in service in the Mediterranean Sea) * (sold, scrapped) * (sold, renamed Corsica Marina II; in service with Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries) * (sold, renamed Sardinia Vera; in service with Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries) * (also operated on Northumberland Strait service, sold, renamed Contessa I and then Texas Treasure II, scrapped) * (sold, scrapped) * (sold, laid up) * (sold, renamed Pelagitis; in service in Greece) ;Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy * (sold, scrapped) * (sold, laid up) ;Labrador coast * (sold, laid up) * (sold, in service with Nunatsiavut Marine Inc.)

This facility had been established by the Newfoundland Railway to build and repair its coastal ferries. In 1949 it was transferred to Canadian National Railways after that company assumed ownership of the Newfoundland Railway when the country entered Confederation. Its responsibility was transferred to the railway's subsidiary CN Marine in 1977 and then to Marine Atlantic in 1986. Upon its privatization in 1997, it was renamed NewDock-St. John's Dockyard Company.

The interpreter is written in Modula-3, and provides Obliq with full access to Modula-3's network objects abilities. A type inference algorithm for record concatenation, subtyping, and recursive types has been developed for Obliq. Further, it has been proved to be NP- completehttp://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/paper/ic04.pdf and its lowest complexity to be or if under other modeling up to certain conditions down to and its best known implementation runs in . Obliq's syntax is very similar to Modula-3, the biggest difference being that Obliq has no need of explicit typed variables (i.e., a variable can hold any data type allowed by the type checker and if does not accepts one, i.e., a given expression execution error will display) although explicit type declarations are allowed and ignored by the interpreter. The basic data types in the language include booleans, integers, reals, characters, strings, and arrays. Obliq supports the usual set of sequential control structures (conditional, iteration, and exception handling forms), and special control forms for concurrency (mutexes and guarded statements). Further, Obliq's objects can be cloned and safely copied remotely by any machine in a distributed network object and it can be done safely and transparently. Obliq's large standard library provides strong support for mathematical operations, input/output (I/O), persistence, thread control, graphics, and animation. Distributed computing is object-based: objects hold a state, which is local to one process. Scope of objects and other variables is purely lexical. Objects can call methods of other objects, even if those objects are on another machine on the network. Obliq objects are simply collections of named fields (similar to slots in Self and Smalltalk), and support inheritance by delegation (like Self). The common uses of Obliq involve programming over networks, 3D animation, and distributed computing, as occurs over a local area network (LAN) such as Ethernet.

Berolini, 1903, p. 586 Also mentioned in the Syrian compilation of Church Historian Zacharias Rhetor bishop of Mytilene It is not clear whether or in what way the Caucasian Avarians are related to the early \\"Pseudo-Avars\\" (or Pannonian Avars) of the Dark Ages, but it is known that with the mediation of Sarosius in 567, the G√∂kt√ºrks requested Byzantium to distinguish the Avars of Pannonia as \\"Pseudo- Avars\\" as opposed to the true Avars of the east, who had come under G√∂kt√ºrk hegemony. The modern Arab Encyclopedia states that the Magyars originated in this area. However, some sources speculate a possible though uncertain connection between the two. The Avar invasion of the Caucasus resulted in the establishment of an Avar ruling dynasty in Sarir, a medieval Christian state in the Dagestani highlands. Old Avarian popular symbols appearing on stone and felt During the Khazar wars against the Caliphate in the 7th century, the Avars sided with Khazaria. Surakat is mentioned as their Khagan around 729‚Äì30 AD, followed by Andunik-Nutsal at the time of Abu Muslima, then Dugry-Nutsal. Sarir suffered a partial eclipse after the Arabs gained the upper hand, but managed to reassert its influence in the region in the 9th century. It confronted the weakened Khazars and conducted a friendly policy towards the neighbouring Christian states of Georgia and Alania. In the early 12th century, Sarir disintegrated, to be succeeded by the Avar Khanate, a predominantly Muslim polity.An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires, by James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, p. 58 The only extant monument of Sarir architecture is a 10th-century church at the village of Datuna. The Mongol invasions seem not to have affected the Avar territory, and the alliance with the Golden Horde enabled the Avar khans to increase their prosperity. In the 15th century the Horde declined, and the Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh rose to power. The Avars could not compete with it and were incorporated by them. From the 16th century onwards, the Persians and Ottomans started consolidating their authority over the entire Caucasus, and divided and consolidated most of its territory for themselves. By the mid-16th century, what is now Eastern Georgia, Dagestan, nowadays Azerbaijan, and Armenia was under Safavid Persian rule,A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Vol. II, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010). 516. while what is now Western Georgia fell under Ottoman Turkish suzerainty.\\"The Reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, 1520‚Äì1566\\", V.J. Parry, A History of the Ottoman Empire to 1730, ed. M.A. Cook (Cambridge University Press, 1976), 94. Although Dagestan was once briefly gained by the Ottoman Turks through the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578‚Äì1590, Dagestan and many of its Avar inhabitants stayed under Persian suzerainty for many centuries. However, many ethnic groups in Dagestan, including many Avars, retained relatively high amounts of freedom and self- rule. After losing the Caucasus briefly in the early 18th century, following the disintegration of the Safavids and the Russo-Persian War of 1722‚Äì1723, the Persians reestablished full control over the Caucasus again in the early 18th century under Nader Shah through his Caucasian campaign and Dagestan campaign. During that same time, the Avars increased their prestige by routing an army of Nader Shah at Andalal during the later stages of his Dagestan campaign.Ramazan Gadzhimuradovich Abdulatipov. Russia and the Caucasus: On the Arduous Path to Unity. Edwin Mellen Press, 2000. p. 15 In the wake of this triumph, Umma Khan of the Avars (who reigned 1774‚Äì1801) managed to exact tribute from most states of the Caucasus, including Shirvan and Georgia. Two years after Umma Khan's death in 1801, the khanate voluntarily submitted to Russian authority following the Russian annexation of Georgia and the Treaty of Georgievsk, but this was only confirmed after considerable Russian successes and the victory in the Russo-Persian War of 1804‚Äì1813, after which Persia lost southern Dagestan and many of the rest of its Caucasus territories to Russia.John F. Baddeley, The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus, Longman, Green and Co., London: 1908, p. 90 The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other areas where the Avars lived and removed Iran from the military equation.Aksan, Virginia.

Imam Shamil (Sheyh Shamil), the leader of uprising against the Russian Empire The Russians' institution of heavy taxation, coupled with the expropriation of estates and the construction of fortresses, aroused the Avar population into rising under the aegis of the Muslim Imamate of Dagestan, led by Ghazi Mohammed (1828‚Äì1832), Gamzat-bek (1832‚Äì1834) and Shamil (1834‚Äì1859). This Caucasian War raged until 1864, when the Avarian Khanate was abolished and the Avarian District was instituted instead. One portion of the Avars refused to collaborate with Russians and migrated to Turkey, where their descendants live to this day. Although the population was decimated through war and emigration, the Avars retained their position as the dominant ethnic group in Dagestan during the Soviet period. After World War II, many Avars left the barren highlands for the fertile plains closer to the shores of the Caspian Sea.  Description  Map of the North Caucasus region Avarians are a Northeast Caucasian people with a Northeast Caucasian language. Another tribe with common name \\"AŒ≤ar\\" according to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"one of a people of undetermined origin and language\\",Avar // Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite.

They also live in Chechnya, Kalmykia and other regions of the Russian state, as well as in Azerbaijan (mainly in the Balakan and Zakatala rayons, with a population of 50,900 in 1999Devlet ƒ∞statistik Komitesi , Az…ôrbaycan Milli Elml…ôr Akademiyasƒ± ƒ∞qtisadiyyat ƒ∞nstitutu and 49,800 in 2009) and Georgia (Kvareli Avars with 1,996 people in 2002). In 2002, Avars, who have assimilated with ethnic groups speaking related languages, numbered about 1.04 million, of whom 912,020 live in Russia (2010 census). Of those living in Russia, 850,011 are in Dagestan (2010 census), 32% of them in cities (2002). Symbol of the Avarian Khanate In Turkey, the population census figures for the North Caucasian population are not given as they are considered as \\"ethnic Turks\\". According to Ataev B.M., according to A.M. Magomeddadaev's research, the Avarian population there should have been around 53,000 in 2005.(Ataev B.M Avars: Language, History, Writing.-Machachkala:DSC RAS, 2005, p.21) Avarians call themselves \\"Awaral\\" (also \\"Ma'arulal\\").  Ethnic groups  Main areas of Northeast Caucasian languages Avarian is a collective term for the Avar, Andi and Tsez (Dido) peoples and generalizes to various ethnic groups native to the foothills.  Avarians as highlanders and armed people  \\"–ú–∞–≥I–∞—Ä—É–ª–∞–ª\\" Ma'arulal means \\"inhabitants of the top grounds, mountaineers\\", but another group of Avarians is described as belonging to another category, \\"–•—å–∏–Ω–¥–∞–ª–∞–ª\\" X'indalal (with a soft \\"œá\\"), namely, \\"inhabitants of plains (warm valleys) and gardeners\\".(Islammagomedov A.I. Avarcy. Maakhachkala, 2002. S. 8) The name Avarians has a narrower meaning for Avarians, especially a national one connected with former statehood. \\"Avar\\" is a significant part of the word \\"Avaria\\" for the Khunzakh Khanate that formed approximately in the 12th century after the disintegration of the local S–∞rir (\\"The Throne\\") empire. From the middle of the 19th century this territory was the Avarian District of the Daghestanian area. Now it is Khunzakhsky District (œáunzaœá in a literary Avarian language or œáwnzaa in a local dialect) of Dagestan.(Kommentarii i primechania Z.Bunijatova//Bakikhanov A.K. Gulistan-Iram. Baku: Elm, 1991, , p. 219) The modern literary language of Avarias (Awar mac'), both in olden times and today, is known among Avarians as the language of \\"bo î\\" (bolmac'). The Avarian word \\"bo\\" \\"army, armed people\\", according to reconstructions, was originally * îœâar(Chirikba V.A. Baskskij i severokavkazskije hazyki//Drevnja Anatolija. Moscow.

Usage of the name \\"Avarians\\"  At the same time, in modern Avarian there are three words retaining their ancient basis of \\"awar\\": awarag \\"the envoy, prophet, messiah\\", awara \\"obstacle, opposition\\"Saidov M.S.

All three listed words are to be found in ancient lexicons of the Iranian languages: Parthian \\"apar\\" Pahlavi/Middle-Pers. abar/aŒ≤ar = \\"up, on, over\\" and \\"higher, superior\\" (also abraz \\"acclivity\\"); abarag/aŒ≤arag \\"superior\\", abargar/aŒ≤argar \\"god, divinity\\", abarmanig/aŒ≤armanig \\"noble\\";MacKenzie D.N.

The term \\"Avar\\" was known in the 10th century. According to Persian author Ibn Rustah a so-called governor of Sarir, the first authentic mention of a population of Daghestanian Highlanders under the name \\"Avars\\" belongs to Yohann de Galonifontibus, who wrote in 1404 that in the Caucasus there live \\"Circassians, Leks, Yasses, Alans, Avars, Kazikumukhs\\".Takhnaeva P.I.

S. 8 According to Vladimir Minorsky, in Zafer, (written in 1424), Daghestanian Avars are called the Auhar. Abbas Kuli-Aga-Bakikhanov in his book Gulistan-i Iram (1841) based on the chronicle \\"Derbend-name\\" wrote that the \\"inhabitants of vicinities of Agran have been moved here from Khurasan.

Buniyatov, confirms that the district of Agran corresponds to the Caucasian Avaria.Bakikhanov A.K., p. 219 This word \\"Agran\\" is now unknown to modern Avars, but according to the Altiranisches W√∂rterbuch of Christian Bartholomae, aŒ≥ra means erste, oberste; Anfang, Spitze (first, upper, beginning, tip) and aŒ≥ra'va vom Obersten, von der Oberseite stammend (from the top, coming from the upper side).Bartholomae, Christian. Altiranisches W√∂rterbuch, Verlag von Karl J.Tr√ºbner, Strassburg, 1904, p. 49 N√∂ldeke, H√ºbschmann, Frye, Christensen and Enoki identify the Aparshahr/Abarshahr/Abharshahr/Abrashahr with Khurasan, or Nishapur.http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/Tezcan_Apar.pdf The Khurasan (œáwarasan) in Iranian studies known as \\"rise of Sun\\", Parthian apar (Middle Persian/Pahlavi abar/aŒ≤ar \\"up, on, over\\" and Parthian/Middle Persian ≈°ahr are cognate with old Iranian œá≈°aŒ∏ra \\"empire, power, the sovereign house\\".) In summary, Apar≈°ahr/AŒ≤ar≈°ahr is very similar to the German word Oberland. According to H.W. Haussig, AŒ≤ar≈°ahr means Reich der Abar (kingdom of the Abar) and should be sought in the south-western territory of the Western Turkish Empire. A Dahae tribe, the Aparnak (Parni) moved from the south-eastern shore of the Caspian (now part of modern Turkmenistan), into the territory of Khurasan (including the area of Gorgan), where they founded a Dahae confederation of tribes that was referred to as \\"barbarians\\" and \\"enemies of Aryans\\" in Avestani texts, according to Christian Bartholomae.Bartholomae, Christian. Altiranisches W√∂rterbuch. Strassburg: Verlag von Karl J. Tr√ºbner, 1904, s. 744 On the border of Khurasan, the Sassanides built a strong wall, named the \\"Great Wall of Gorgan\\" or \\"The Red Snake\\", was built to protect Iran from invasion by the so-called White Huns (Hepthalites; Khionites, X'iiaona and Xy√¥n in Zoroastrian texts).http://www.univie.ac.at/chwh/content/recentpublications/cac_ii.pdf Later another wave of White Huns obtained control over Khurasan and kept it for a long time. According to Richard Helli: \\"By such reasoning, the Ephthalites are thought to have originated at Hsi-mo-ta-lo (southwest of Badakhshan and near the Hindu Kush), which tantalizingly, stands for Himtala, \\"snow plain\\", which may be the Sanskritized form of Hephthal.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/hephthalites.html&date;=2009-10-26+00:09:20 In 484 the Hephthalite chief Akhshunwar led his army to attack the Sassanian King Peroz (459‚Äì484), who was defeated and killed in Khurasan. After the victory, the Hephthalite empire extended to Merv and Herat. Some of the White Huns concluded a peace treaty with Iran and the two became allies, both fighting against Byzantium. Thus, Hephthalites really lived in the Khurasan/Khorasan area. According to the Chinese classic Liang chih-kung-t'u, Êªë (pinyin: hua) was the name the Hephthalites used for themselves, and that is probably a Chinese transfer of a similar-sounding word, war/Uar. Mehmed Tezcan writes that according to a Chinese record, the Hephthalites descended from a Ruan Ruan tribe called Hua in the Qeshi region (Turfan area). This tribe came to Tokharistan and soon settled also in eastern regions of Khorasan at the beginning of the 5th century. About the same time, the name Avars/Awards appears in the sources. Again, in his well-known Atlas of China, A. Herrmann shows the eastern regions of Khorasan, Tokharistan, etc. as the dominions of Afu/Hua/Awards/Hephthalites between ca. 440 and 500 A.D., relying on the identification Hua = Uar = Awar. The German researcher Karl Menges, well known in the scientific world, considered Eurasian Avars to be one of the ancient Mongol peoples, who \\"were the first to use the title ga gan (later qƒÅn, ·∏µƒÅn) for their supreme ruler.\\" Further listing ancient Mongol speaking peoples, he obviously has in view Avars Caucasian when he mentions the \\"traces of a Mongol residue in Daghestan\\".

Several dozen websites are dedicated to WAM. Many people with WAM fetishes are drawn to the tactile sensations of wet or messy substances against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the visual appeal of others getting wet or messy with products that have different textures, consistencies and colours. A subject will often be pelted with cream pies (sometimes using shaving foam rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish. Messy substances most commonly focused on by WAM participants include whipped cream, raw eggs, milk, lotion (see lotion play), paint, oil, mud, pudding, chocolate sauce, fruit juice, beer, shaving foam, shampoo, soap (see Soapland), custard, baked beans, treacle, ketchup, ice cream, peanut butter, slime, and cake batter, among others. A fetish for bodily fluids such as feces, urine, vomit, semen, and female ejaculate is not considered part of WAM. The former three are typically considered coprophilia, urophilia, and emetophilia; urophilia is occasionally found in mainstream pornography; the other two are less common fetishes. WAM fetish videos (made by both fans and commercial producers) may include nudity and sexual acts, while others may only feature fully clothed participants. Videos can frequently be seen on public video hosting sites like YouTube. Some of these videos are flagged but most of them remain available despite the sexual undertones, mainly because a large majority of wet and messy videos posted publicly do not include nudity and are therefore considered suitable for all audiences to view. Indeed, not only is much WAM video content indistinguishable in any easily defined sense from the kind of slapstick featured in mainstream entertainment, but scenes of slimings or pieings from the mainstream media are often compiled and marketed by producers towards a WAM fetishist target audience. Crossover with other fetishes There is some crossover between the wet and messy fetish and clothing destruction fetishes. Some WAM productions will see models start out fully dressed, usually in quite smart outfits such as formal dresses or suits; they will then be covered in messy substances, after which their messy clothes are cut up, typically with scissors, leaving them naked or nearly so. WAM is sometimes also combined with bondage, where a subject is first restrained or chained up and then hosed down or messed up. Wet and Messy fetishism lends itself well to domination/submission role-playing. \\"Cake Sitting\\" (the act of deliberately sitting on a large cake or gateaux, either clothed or nude) is often considered a sub-fetish in its own right, but may be linked to the crush fetish. While participants who sit on cakes for pleasure will do so for the tactile sensory experience, or as part of submissive role-playing, those who enjoy watching the act will often focus specifically on the crushing of the dessert as a visual stimulus for a sexual reaction. Psychology No conclusive research has been conducted into the psychology behind the fetish; however, it is not uncommon for fetishists to have had interest in the sensations of messy play since their formative years (age 3‚Äì4) with a sexual element manifesting with the onset of puberty. For many, the simple breaking of taboos‚Äîdoing what one was told not to as a child‚Äîbrings about a sense of personal liberation. In any form, the fetish is about sensual stimulation, whether visual, tactile, or otherwise. One unproven theory is that individuals drawn to WAM have low tactile sensitivity, which is increased and intensified by wet substances acting as a lubricant under applied pressure or friction. \\"Messy play\\" is a common clinical therapy used in treating hypo-tactile patients (mostly pediatric cases) to give them an outlet and appropriate time and place to engage in mess-making. Another aspect is the link to other fetishes, as some wet and messy play is done in a submissive or dominating way and has possible links to BDSM, the emphasis being on the humiliation of the victim, although this is often mitigated or negated by the victim taking it in good humour. The dominant partner inflicting the mess can also be an object of attraction as an assertive figure of playful mischief. In media The popular sex column Savage Love has mentioned WAM. In one article, there was a reply to a letter from the roommate of someone who masturbates with condiments, possibly for fetishistic purposes. Daniel Savage, the writer of Savage Love, did not condemn the use of condiments in that incident, but, instead, only chided the fetishist for using condiments that were later used by others.

At the time the term for research of paranormal activities was \\"psychical research\\". Early life Gurney was born at Hersham, near Walton-on-Thames. He was educated at Blackheath and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1866, where he took fourth place in the classical tripos and obtained a fellowship in 1872. His work for the tripos was done, said his friend F. W. H. Myers, in the intervals of his practice on the piano. Dissatisfied with his own executive skill as a musician, he wrote The Power of Sound (1880), an essay on the philosophy of music. He then studied medicine with no intention of practising, devoting himself to physics, chemistry and physiology. In 1880 he passed the second M.B. Cambridge (medical science). In 1881 he began the study of law at Lincoln's Inn. In relation to psychical research, he asked whether there is an unexplored region of human faculty transcending the normal limitations of sensible knowledge. Gurney's purpose was to approach the subject by observation and experiment, especially in the hypnotism field. He wanted to investigate the persistence of the conscious human personality after the death of the body. Three of his sisters died when their barge overturned in the Nile River during a tour of Egypt in 1875. Their passing profoundly affected him and his research was partially fueled by a desire to find some meaning to their deaths. Experimental work Gurney began at what he later saw was the wrong end by studying, with Myers, the s√©ances of professed spiritualistic mediums (1874‚Äì1878). Little but detection of imposture came of this. In 1882 the Society for Psychical Research was founded. Paid mediums were discarded, at least for the time, and experiments were made in thought-transference and hypnotism. Personal evidence as to uninduced hallucinations was also collected. The first results are embodied in the volumes of Phantasms of the Living, a vast collection (Frank Podmore, Myers and Gurney), and in Gurney's essay, Hallucinations. Evidence for the process called telepathy was supposed to be established by the experiments chronicled in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, and it was argued that similar experiences occurred spontaneously, as, for example, in the many recorded instances of deathbed wraiths.Tylor, Primitive Culture, i. chapter xi., especially pp. 449-450, 1873. Lang, Making of Religion, pp. 120-124, 1898. The dying man was supposed to convey the hallucination of his presence as one living person experimentally conveys his thought to another, by thought-transference. Gurney's hypnotic experiments were undertaken in the years 1885 to 1888. Their tendency was, in Myers's view, to prove that there is sometimes, in the induction of hypnotic phenomena, some agency at work which is neither ordinary nervous stimulation nor suggestion conveyed by any ordinary channel to the subject's mind. These results, if accepted, would corroborate the idea of telepathy.See Gurney, Hypnotism and Telepathy, Proceedings S. P. R. vol. iv. Experiments by Joseph Gibert, Paul Janet, Charles Richet, M√©ricourt and others were cited as tending in the same direction. Other experiments dealt with the relation of the memory in the hypnotic state to the memory in another hypnotic state, and of both to the normal memory. Gurney's research into psychic matters was respected by contemporaries. However, it has since then been argued to be deeply flawed: Gurney trusted in the assistance of one George Albert Smith, a theatrical performer and producer. Smith was the one handling the actual experiments into telepathy, hypnotism, and the rest, and Gurney fully accepted his results. According to Hall, in the spring of 1888 Gurney discovered that Smith had used his knowledge of theatrical trickery and stage illusion to fake tests and results; so that the value of the tests (with which Gurney was building up his reputation) were worthless. Douglas Blackburn, Smith's principal partner in the mentalist performances and experiments, publicly admitted fraud in 1908 and again in 1911, although Smith denied it. Death He died at Brighton on 23 June 1888, from the effects of an overdose of chloroform. At the inquest Arthur Thomas Myers, the brother of F.W.H. Myers, testified to having prescribed chloroform for neuralgia,Oppenheim (1985) p.144 and a verdict of accidental death was recorded. It was widely thought at the time that Gurney might have committed suicide, and Alice James recorded this in her diary. Trevor Hall in his study The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney has argued the case that Gurney's death was suicide, resulting from disillusionment after discovering the frauds of Blackburn and Smith. Gordon Epperson argues against this hypothesis and Janet Oppenheim concludes that \\"the mystery is not likely to be resolved\\".Oppenheim (1985) p.145 Works In addition to his work on music and his psychological writings, he was the author of Tertium Quid (1887), a collection of essays, the title a protest against one-sided ideas and methods of discussion. Personal life In 1877 Gurney married Kate Sara Sibley. They had one daughter, Helen, born in 1881. After Gurney's death, Kate married Archibald Grove, a journalist and politician, in 1889.

During Lent, Catholics and other Christians are encouraged to refrain from eating meat. However, are humorously associated with these days because the meat in the dish is concealed under the pasta dough and cannot be seen by God.

The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is: arginine + H2O ‚Üí ornithine + urea. It is the final enzyme of the urea cycle. It is ubiquitous to all domains of life.  Structure and function  Arginase belong to the ureohydrolase family of enzymes. Arginase catalyzes the fifth and final step in the urea cycle, a series of biochemical reactions in mammals during which the body disposes of harmful ammonia. Specifically, arginase converts L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. Mammalian arginase is active as a trimer, but some bacterial arginases are hexameric. The enzyme requires a two-molecule metal cluster of manganese in order to maintain proper function. These Mn2+ ions coordinate with water, orienting and stabilizing the molecule and allowing water to act as a nucleophile and attack L-arginine, hydrolyzing it into ornithine and urea. In most mammals, two isozymes of this enzyme exist; the first, Arginase I, functions in the urea cycle, and is located primarily in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes (liver cells). The second isozyme, Arginase II, has been implicated in the regulation of intracellular arginine/ornithine levels. It is located in mitochondria of several tissues in the body, with most abundance in the kidney and prostate. It may be found at lower levels in macrophages, lactating mammary glands, and brain. The second isozyme may be found in the absence of other urea cycle enzymes.  Mechanism  The active site holds L-arginine in place via hydrogen bonding between the guanidine group with Glu227. This bonding orients L-arginine for nucleophilic attack by the metal- associated hydroxide ion at the guanidine group. This results in a tetrahedral intermediate. The manganese ions act to stabilize both the hydroxyl group in the tetrahedral intermediate, as well as the developing sp3 lone electron pair on the NH2 group as the tetrahedral intermediate is formed. Arginase's active site is extraordinarily specific. Modifying the substrate structure and/or stereochemistry severely lowers the kinetic activity of the enzyme. This specificity occurs due to the high number of hydrogen bonds between substrate and enzyme; direct or water-facilitated hydrogen bonds exist, saturating both the four acceptor positions on the alpha carboxylate group and all three positions on the alpha amino group. N-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA), an intermediate of NO biosynthesis, is a moderate inhibitor of arginase. Crystal structure of its complex with the enzyme reveals that it displaces the metal- bridging hydroxide ion and bridges the binuclear manganese cluster. Additionally, 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexonic acid (ABH) is an L-arginine analogue that also creates a tetrahedral intermediate similar to that formed in the catalysis of the natural substrate, and is a potent inhibitor of human arginase I.  Role in sexual response  Arginase II is coexpressed with nitric oxide (NO) synthase in smooth muscle tissue, such as the muscle in the genitals of both men and women. The contraction and relaxation of these muscles has been attributed to NO synthase, which causes rapid relaxation of smooth muscle tissue and facilitates engorgement of tissue necessary for normal sexual response. However, since NO synthase and arginase compete for the same substrate (L-arginine), over-expressed arginase can affect NO synthase activity and NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation by depleting the substrate pool of L-arginine that would otherwise be available to NO synthase. In contrast, inhibiting arginase with ABH or other boronic acid inhibitors will maintain normal cellular levels of arginine, thus allowing for normal muscle relaxation and sexual response. Arginase is a controlling factor in both male erectile function and female sexual arousal, and is therefore a potential target for treatment of sexual dysfunction in both sexes. Additionally, supplementing the diet with additional L-arginine will decrease the amount of competition between arginase and NO synthase by providing extra substrate for each enzyme.  Pathology  Arginase deficiency typically refers to decreased function of arginase I, the liver isoform of arginase. This deficiency is commonly referred to as hyperargininemia or arginemia. The disorder is hereditary and autosomal recessive. It is characterized by lowered activity of arginase in hepatic cells. It is considered to be the rarest of the heritable defects in ureagenesis. Arginase deficiency, unlike other urea cycle disorders, does not entirely prevent ureagenesis. A proposed reason for the continuation of arginase function is suggested by increased activity of arginase II in the kidneys of subjects with arginase I deficiency. Researchers believe that buildup of arginine triggers increased expression of arginase II. The enzymes in the kidney will then catalyze ureagenesis, compensating somewhat for a decrease in arginase I activity in the liver. Due to this alternate method of removing excess arginine and ammonia from the bloodstream, subjects with arginase deficiency tend to have longer lifespans than those who have other urea cycle defects. Symptoms of the disorder include neurological impairment, dementia, retardation of growth, and hyperammonemia. While some symptoms of the disease can be controlled via dietary restrictions and pharmaceutical developments, no cure or completely effective therapy currently exists.

Early Life He was born in London to Philip Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Chesterfield, and Lady Elizabeth Savile, and known as Lord Stanhope until the death of his father, in 1726. Following the death of his mother in 1708, Stanhope was raised mainly by his grandmother, the Marchioness of Halifax. Educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he left just over a year into his studies, after focusing on languages and oration. He subsequently embarked on the Grand Tour of the Continent, to complete his education as a nobleman, by exposure to the cultural legacies of Classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to become acquainted with his aristocratic counterparts and the polite society of Continental Europe. In the course of his post-graduate tour of Europe, the death of Queen Anne (r. 1702‚Äì1714) and the accession of King George I (r. 1714‚Äì1727) to the throne opened a political career for Stanhope, and he quickly returned to England. A member of the Whig party, Phillip Stanhope entered government service as a courtier to the King, through the mentorship of his relative, James Stanhope, (later 1st Earl Stanhope), the King's favourite minister, who procured his appointment as Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales, George II. Political career In 1715, Philip Dormer Stanhope entered the House of Commons as Lord Stanhope of Shelford and as member for St Germans. Later, when the impeachment of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde came before the House, he used the occasion (5 August 1715) to try out the result of his rhetorical studies. His maiden speech was fluent and dogmatic, but upon its conclusion, another member ‚Äì after first complimenting the speech ‚Äì reminded the young orator that he was still six weeks short of his age of majority, and, consequently, was liable to a fine of ¬£500 for speaking in the House; Lord Stanhope left the House of Commons with a low bow and set out for the Continent. While in Paris, he sent the government valuable information about the developing Jacobite plot; and in 1716 he returned to Britain, resumed his seat, and became known as a skilled yet tactful debater. When King George I quarreled with his son, the Prince of Wales (George II) that same year, Lord Stanhope remained politically faithful to the Prince, while being careful not to break with the King's party.\\" However, his continued friendly correspondence with the Prince's mistress ‚Äì Henrietta Howard, later Countess of Suffolk ‚Äì earned Chesterfield the personal hatred of the Prince's wife, Princess Caroline of Ansbach. In 1723 he was voted Captain of the Gentlemen Pensioners. In January 1725, on the revival of the Order of the Bath, the red ribbon was offered to him, but Chesterfield declined the honour. Upon his father's death in 1726, Lord Stanhope assumed his seat in the House of Lords and became the 4th Earl of Chesterfield. The new Lord Chesterfield's inclination towards oration ‚Äì often seen as ineffective in the House of Commons due to its polish and lack of force ‚Äì was met with appreciation in the House of Lords, and won many to his side. In 1728, under service to the new king, George II, Chesterfield was sent to the Hague as ambassador, where his gentle tact and linguistic dexterity served him well. As a reward for his diplomatic service, Chesterfield received the Order of the Garter in 1730, the position of Lord Steward, and the friendship of Robert Walpole. While a British envoy in the Hague, he helped negotiate the second Treaty of Vienna (1731), which signaled the collapse of the Anglo- French Alliance, and the beginning of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. In 1732, Madelina Elizabeth du Bouchet ‚Äì a French governess ‚Äì gave birth to his illegitimate son, Philip, for whose advice on life Chesterfield wrote the Letters to his Son. By the end of 1732, ill health and financial troubles led to Chesterfield's return to Britain and resignation as ambassador In 1731, while at The Hague, Chesterfield initiated the Grand Duke of Tuscany (later to become Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor) from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine into Freemasonry, which was at the time being used as an intelligence network by the British Whigs. In 1733, Lord Chesterfield married Melusina von der Schulenberg, the Countess of Walsingham, who was the illegitimate daughter of the late King George I and his mistress, the Duchess of Kendal. After recuperating from his illness, Chesterfield resumed his seat in the House of Lords, of which he was now one of the acknowledged leaders. He supported the ministry and leadership of Robert Walpole, the de facto Prime Minister, but withheld the blind fealty that Walpole preferred of his followers. Lord Chesterfield strongly opposed The Excise Bill, the Whig party leader's favourite measure, in the House of Lords while his brothers argued against it in the House of Commons. Even though Walpole eventually succumbed to the political fury and abandoned the measure, Chesterfield was summarily dismissed from his stewardship. For the next two years, he led the opposition in the Upper House to effect Walpole's downfall. During this time, he resided in Grosvenor Square and got involved in the creation of a new London charity called the Foundling Hospital, for which he was a founding governor. In 1741, he signed the protest for Walpole's dismissal and went abroad on account of his health; after visiting Voltaire in Brussels, Lord Chesterfield went to Paris where he associated with writers and men of letters, including Crebillon the Younger, Fontenelle and Montesquieu. In 1742, Walpole's fall from political power was complete, but although he and his administration had been overthrown in no small part due to Chesterfield's efforts, the new ministry did not count Chesterfield either in its ranks or among its supporters. He remained in opposition, distinguishing himself by the courtly bitterness of his attacks on King George II, who learned to hate him violently. In 1743, Chesterfield began writing under the name of \\"Jeffrey Broadbottom\\" for pamphlets and a new journal, Old England; or, the Constitutional Journal that appeared with quick circulation (broad bottom being a term for a government with cross-party appeal). A number of pamphlets, in some of which Chesterfield had the help of Edmund Waller, followed. His energetic campaign against George II and his government won the gratitude of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, who left him ¬£20,000 as a mark of her appreciation. In 1744, the king was compelled to abandon Lord Carteret, successor to Robert Walpole, and the coalition for a \\"Broad Bottom\\" party, led by Chesterfield and Pitt, came into office in coalition with the Pelhams. In the troubled state of European politics, the Earl's calm conduct and diplomatic experience were more useful abroad than at home, and he was sent to The Hague as ambassador for a second time. The object of his mission this time was to persuade the Dutch to join in the War of the Austrian Succession and to arrange the details of their assistance. Success was quickly achieved, and on his return a few weeks afterwards, he received the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, a place he had long coveted. Chesterfield's \\"Phoenix Monument\\" (1746) in the Phoenix Park, Dublin Lord Chesterfield's short administration (January 1745 ‚Äì November 1746) in Ireland was effective, as he repressed the corruption traditional to the office, and established schools and factories. He was the first official to allow Dubliners to roam in the Phoenix Park, and installed the central \\"Phoenix Monument\\", a phoenix bird on a Corinthian column (the 2.8 mi main road through the park is still known as Chesterfield Avenue). He worked with and pacified both the Protestant Orange Order and Roman Catholic pro-Jacobite factions; as a result Irish Jacobites did not assist the Jacobite rising of 1745. Anecdotally, upon being roused for a false alarm of an Irish rebellion and being told that \\"the papists in Ireland are all up!\\", he replied: \\"I am not surprised at it, why, it is ten o'clock, I should have been up too, had I not overslept myself.\\" In 1746, however, he had to exchange the Lord- Lieutenancy for Secretary of State. Chesterfield had hoped to retain a hold over the king through the influence of Lady Yarmouth, the mistress of George II, but John Montagu (4th Earl of Sandwich) and Thomas Pelham-Holles (1st Duke of Newcastle) combined forces against him, and in 1748, he resigned the seals and returned to his books and playing cards with the admirable composure that was one of his most striking characteristics. Despite his denials, Lord Chesterfield is speculated to have at least helped write Apology for a late Resignation, in a Letter from an English Gentleman to his Friend at The Hague, which ran for four editions in 1748. Later years While continuing to attend and participate in the Upper House proceedings, Lord Chesterfield turned down the dukedom offered him by King George II, whose wrath had melted in the face of Chesterfield's diplomacy and rhetoric. In 1751, seconded by George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, president of the Royal Society, and the mathematician James Bradley, Chesterfield greatly distinguished himself in the debates on establishing a definitive calendar for Britain and the Commonwealth. With the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, he successfully established the Gregorian calendar and a calendar year that began on 1 January for the British realm; informally, the calendar act also is known as the \\"Chesterfield‚Ä≤s Act\\". Around this time he started gradually withdrawing from both politics and society, due to his growing deafness. In 1755 he and Samuel Johnson had a dispute over A Dictionary of the English Language. Eight years previously (1747), Johnson had sent then Secretary of State Chesterfield, an outline of his Dictionary, along with a business offer for such; Chesterfield agreed and invested ¬£10 pounds. Although Chesterfield wrote two anonymous articles for World magazine shortly before the dictionary's publication which praised both Johnson's exhaustive editorial work and the comprehensive dictionary itself, Johnson was disappointed at the little to no interest in the project from Lord Chesterfield during its compilation. Upset with what he saw as a lack of support from an avowed man of letters and patron of literature, Johnson wrote the Letter to Chesterfield which dealt with the dynamics of the patron‚Äìartist relation. Chesterfield was not offended by the letter, but instead impressed by the language. After receiving it, he displayed it on a table for visitors to read, and, according to Robert Dodsley, said \\"This man has great powers\\" and then he \\"pointed out the severest passages, and observed how well they were expressed.\\" Adams told Johnson what was said, and Johnson responded, \\"That is not Lord Chesterfield; he is the proudest man this day\\", to which Adams responded, \\"No, there is one person at least as proud; I think, by your own account, you are the prouder man of the two.\\" Johnson, finishing, said, \\"But mine, was defensive pride.\\" In the 1760s, Chesterfield offered a cogent critique of the Stamp Act 1765 passed by Grenville's parliament. In a letter to his friend, the Duke of Newcastle, Chesterfield noted the absurdity of the Stamp Act because it could not be properly enforced, but, if effective, the Act would generate a revenue no greater than eighty-thousand pounds sterling per year, whilst the annual cost of reduced trade from the American colonies would be about one million pounds sterling.Barbara Tuchman, \\"The March of Folly\\", pg 158. 1984.  Letters to His Son  Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield by William Hoare. Eugenia Stanhope, the impoverished widow of Chesterfield's illegitimate son, Philip Stanhope, was the first to publish the book Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman (1774), which comprises a thirty-year correspondence in more than four hundred letters. Begun in 1737 and continued until the death of his son in 1768, Chesterfield wrote mostly instructive communications about geography, history, and classical literature, ‚Äì with later letters focusing on politics and diplomacy ‚Äì and the letters themselves were written in French, English, and Latin, in order to refine his son's grasp of the languages. As a handbook for worldly success in the 18th century, the Letters to His Son give perceptive and nuanced advice for how a gentleman should interpret the social codes that are manners, for example: > . . . However frivolous a company may be, still, while you are among them, > do not show them, by your inattention, that you think them so; but rather > take their tone, and conform in some degree to their weakness, instead of > manifesting your contempt for them. There is nothing that people bear more > impatiently, or forgive less, than contempt; and an injury is much sooner > forgotten than an insult. If, therefore, you would rather please than > offend, rather be well than ill spoken of, rather be loved than hated; > remember to have that constant attention about you which flatters every > man's little vanity; and the want of which, by mortifying his pride, never > fails to excite his resentment, or at least his ill will. . . Samuel Johnson said of the letters \\"they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of a dancing-master\\" as means for getting on in the world as a gentleman.Mayo, Christopher. \\"Letters To His Son\\". The Literary Encyclopedia, 25 February 2007 accessed 30 November 2011. Despite having been an accomplished essayist and epigrammatist in his time, Lord Chesterfield's literary reputation today derives almost entirely from Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman (1774) and Letters to His Godson (1890), books of private correspondence and paternal and avuncular advice, which he never intended for publication. Need for a Legitimate Heir Chesterfield House in 1760 (Old & New London, 1878) In 1768 Chesterfield's beloved yet illegitimate son, Philip Stanhope, died in France of dropsy, leaving behind his widow, Eugenia Stanhope and their two illegitimate sons, Charles and Philip. Despite his short life, the privileged education provided by his father, Lord Chesterfield, allowed Philip Stanhope an honourable career in the diplomatic service of Britain, despite being handicapped as a nobleman's illegitimate son. The grieving Chesterfield was disappointed to learn that Philip's long and mostly secret relationship (they married the year before his death) had been to Eugenia, a woman of humble social class, since this was a topic he'd covered at length in the Letters to his Son; however, Lord Chesterfield bequeathed an annuity of ¬£100 to each of his grandsons, Charles Stanhope (1761‚Äì1845) and Philip Stanhope (1763‚Äì1801), and a further ¬£10,000 for them both, yet left no pension for his widowed daughter-in-law, Eugenia. It was this lack of funds that led to Eugenia selling the Letters to his Son to a publisher. Left without a legitimate heir to his lands and property ‚Äì he and his wife, Melusina von der Schulenburg had no children together ‚Äì Lord Chesterfield acted to protect his hereditary interests by adopting his distant cousin and godson, Philip Stanhope (1755‚Äì1815), as his heir and successor to the title Earl of Chesterfield.  Death  The 4th Earl of Chesterfield (Philip Dormer Stanhope) died on 24 March 1773, at Chesterfield House, Westminster, his London townhouse (built about 1749). His godson and adopted heir then became Lord Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield. Legacy ;In literature Decades after his death, Lord Chesterfield appears as a character in the novel The Virginians (1857), by William Makepeace Thackeray, and is mentioned in the novel Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty (1841), by Charles Dickens, wherein the foppish Sir John Chester says that Lord Chesterfield is the finest English writer: > Shakespeare was undoubtedly very fine in his way; Milton good, though prosy; > Lord Bacon deep, and decidedly knowing; but the writer who should be his > country's pride, is my Lord Chesterfield. ;Places In the UK, the 4th Earl of Chesterfield gave his name to Chesterfield Street, Mayfair, London, which runs from Curzon Street, site of the former Chesterfield House; in the US, his name has been given to Chesterfield County, Virginia and Chesterfield County, South Carolina. Furniture The first leather chesterfield sofa, with its distinctive deep buttoned, quilted leather upholstery and lower seat base, is believed to have been commissioned by Lord Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. Consequently, in the UK, the word chesterfield now describes a deep buttoned sofa, usually made from leather, with arms and back of the same height. In Canada, chesterfield used to be the predominate term for any type of couch, but has been decreasing in popularity among the younger generations. Other Chesterfield Cigarettes were named after Chesterfield County, Virginia, which was itself named for the 4th Earl of Chesterfield. Vincent La Chapelle, a French master cook, wrote The Modern Cook while in the employ of Lord Chesterfield, and lived abroad with him in The Hague during his ambassador years. After leaving the service of the 4th Earl of Chesterfield, La Chapelle went on to cook for ‚Äì among others ‚Äì William IV, Prince of Orange, John V of Portugal, and Madame de Pompadour (mistress of Louis XV of France). Chesterfield coats, for both men and women, are woolen overcoats with velvet on the collar, an elegant touch. Lord Chesterfield Ale, made by DG Yuengling &Son;, Inc.

It is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between Highgate and Tufnell Park stations, in Zones 2 and 3. Location Side entrance on Highgate Hill. When constructed, the area was simply the northern end of Holloway Road and had no specific name but, in the hope of attracting patronage, the terminus was originally named Highgate after the village up the hill. At the time of the station's construction the first cable car in Europe operated non-stop up Highgate Hill to the village from outside the Archway Tavern, and this name was also considered for the station. The main station entrance now lies beneath Archway Tower on Junction Road while the side entrance is on Highgate Hill. History The station lies at the base of Archway Tower, viewed from Junction Road. The Leslie Green designed station opened on 22 June 1907, under the name Highgate faced in Green's standard ox-blood glazed brick. It was opened as one of the northern terminals of what was then the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;). The station was renamed Archway (Highgate) on 11 June 1939 (after the nearby road bridge over the deep cutting containing Archway Road). On 3 July 1939, the line was extended to the Great Northern Railway's station at Highgate and East Finchley station as part of the New Works Programme. The station was renamed Highgate (Archway) on 19 January 1941, before becoming just Archway in December 1947 with the Highgate name being reassigned to the new station constructed beneath the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) high-level station of the same name. Design In 1930 the station was upgraded with escalators to replace the original lifts and the secondary entrance was replaced with a modern design by Charles Holden, virtually identical to the one he built at the same time at Hammersmith. Holden's station was replaced in the 1970s. The platform walls once featured the distinctive and elegantly simple tiling schemes used by Holden on the underground stations constructed at this time. Cream tiles were used throughout with the station name band formed of letter shaped tiles inset into a background of cream tiles incised to accept the lettering. Similar tiling schemes can be seen at the neighbouring Highgate station, as well as at Bethnal Green and the stations on the tunnelled section of the Hainault branch of the Central line (for example Gants Hill). All were built in the late 1930s/early 1940s. The tiles at Archway were replaced several years ago during retiling works. The station currently (as of 2015) has escalators (Otis type HD-B) to get down to the platforms. Alternatively, passengers can use the 113 steps to get down to the platforms. Crossover and siding Northbound platform looking north. The small width of the platform together with the southbound one reflect the station's former role as a terminus. When the original section of the Northern Line from Charing Cross to Golders Green and Archway (then Highgate) was opened in 1907, the terminus at Archway was provided with a scissors crossover just south of the station and the running lines beyond the north end of the platforms continued as separate dead-end sidings. When the line was extended to Highgate and East Finchley in 1939, the 'northbound' siding was extended as the northbound road while the 'southbound' siding was retained as a dead-end siding, extended at the north end with the new southbound line from Highgate joining it just before the southbound platform and a new connection from the northbound line to the siding, thus turning the old 'southbound' siding into a central reversing siding. The crossover south of the station was subsequently converted to a single trailing crossover but was decommissioned on 15 October 1967, when Archway was converted to programme-machine control from Cobourg Street. The signal box closed on 25 June 1961 when Archway became remote-controlled. The enlarged crossover tunnel remains although cable runs extend down its centre between the two tracks for most of its length. The layout of the platforms and the underground passenger areas still reflect the station's former role as a terminus. Services Northern line trains generally operate between Morden or Kennington to Edgware, High Barnet or Mill Hill East via the Charing Cross or the Bank branch. Occasionally and during disruptions or engineering works, trains can terminate at Archway. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3‚Äì7 minutes between 05:58 and 00:19 in both directions.

However, it would have to wait until the 1960s before a genuine Quebec cinema industry would emerge. Approximately 620 feature-length films have been produced, or partially produced by the Quebec film industry since 1943. Due to language and cultural differences between the predominantly francophone population of Quebec and the predominantly anglophone population of the rest of Canada, Quebec's film industry is commonly regarded as a distinct entity from its English Canadian counterpart. In addition to participating in Canada's national Genie Awards, the Quebec film industry also maintains its own awards ceremony, the Prix Iris (formerly known as Jutra). In addition, the popularity of homegrown French language films among Quebec audiences, as opposed to English Canadians' preference for Hollywood films, means that Quebec films are often more successful at the box office than English Canadian films ‚Äî in fact, the top-grossing Canadian film of the year is often a French language film from Quebec. Before the Office national du film From 1896 to the 1960s, the Catholic clergy tried to control what movies Quebecers could see. Two methods were employed: censorship and prohibition of attendance by children under 16. In 1913, the Bureau de censure de vues anim√©es (Office of censorship for motion pictures) began regulating the projection of movies in Quebec. In 1927, the Laurier-Palace Theatre burned down, killing 78 children. The church then almost succeeded at closing down all projection rooms in the province. However, the Parliament of Quebec passed a law preventing only children under 16 from attending movie projections. This law would be repealed only in 1961. Nevertheless, some films were produced in Quebec during this period. Those were mostly documentaries, some of which were made by priests (Albert Tessier) and civil servants (Herm√©n√©gilde Lavoie). Joseph-Arthur Homier is considered the first director of feature-length films in Quebec, and his 1922 production, Madeleine de Verch√®res, was based on the life of the 17th-century Quebec heroine, Madeleine de Verch√®res. In the 1940s and 1950s, the first commercial attempts at cinema happened. Two production houses were at the origins of all the movies of this period: Renaissance Films and Qu√©bec Productions. Most of the commercial feature films came primarily from four directors: Fyodor Otsep, , Jean-Yves Bigras, and . Notable films of this period include ' (1945), ' (1949), La petite Aurore l'enfant martyre (1952), Tit-Coq (1953), and Les br√ªl√©s (1959). After the Office national du film The National Film Board of Canada was established by the Parliament of Canada in 1939. Its office moved from Ottawa to Montreal in 1956. In 1957, the new commissioner, Albert Trueman, recommended the creation of a separately funded French production wing. Minister J. W. Pickersgill rejected Trueman's recommendation as Ottawa feared that two separate organizations would develop under the same roof. This decision intensified the campaign of the Quebec French language press for an autonomous French language branch. Guy Roberge was appointed as the NFB's first francophone Commissioner in April 1957. The French branch of the National Film Board of Canada was established and the NFB became autonomous in 1959. Direct Cinema filmmakers Michel Brault, Pierre Perrault and Gilles Groulx all made their debut at the NFB. That decade also saw the beginnings of directors Claude Jutra, Gilles Carle and Denys Arcand. The 1960s and 1970s Two key changes in the late 1960s paved the way for a new era in Qu√©b√©cois cinema. First, in 1967, Quebec's (religious) censorship bureau was replaced by a film ratings system administered by the province. The other phenomenon was the introduction, in 1967, by the federal government, of its Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC, to become Telefilm Canada). This allowed a greater number of films to reach the screen through government subsidy. Commercial directors such as Denis H√©roux became known for his films Val√©rie and ', two comedies with erotic overtones showing popular success not seen in Quebec since Jean-Yves Bigras' La Petite Aurore l'enfant martyre (1952).http://www.canuxploitation.com/article/cochons.html The seventies also marked a high in national filmmaking seen from an artistic perspective, an assessment supported by opinion polls such as the TIFF List of Canada's Top 10 Films of All Time, which has included several films from that decade every year that the poll was taken. Arcand and Carle had critical (especially at Cannes) and some commercial success with films such as Gina (Arcand) and La vraie nature de Bernadette (Carle). In 1971, director Claude Jutra released one of the most critically praised Quebec film to date, Mon oncle Antoine. However, his next movie, an adaptation of Anne H√©bert's Kamouraska, was a commercial and critical failure. It should be mentioned that this film suffered re-editing done to accommodate theater owners. A two-hour-long restored version, seen in 2003, shows more artistic coherence. In 1977, Jean Beaudin's J.A. Martin Photographe was selected at Cannes where Monique Mercure, the female star of the film, won Best Actress (tying with Shelley Duvall for 3 Women). The 1980s The victory of the \\"no\\" camp in the referendum on sovereignty association was a turning point in Qu√©b√©cois history and culture. Denys Arcand made one of his most acclaimed picture with the NFB, Le confort et l'indiff√©rence, about the result of the referendum. He then proceeded to direct two movies that were nominated for best foreign picture at the Academy Awards: 1986's The Decline of the American Empire (Le D√©clin de l'empire am√©ricain) and 1989's Jesus of Montreal (J√©sus de Montr√©al). After 1980, a lot of artists felt that the struggle to build a nation that had animated early Quebec cinema was lost. Qu√©b√©cois filmmakers began to make movies that were no longer centred on the Qu√©b√©cois identity. The 1986 success, at home and abroad, of Le d√©clin... marked another turning point in the movie history of the province. The government-funded movie industry tried to repeat Arcand's success with international co-productions, big budget movies and so-called \\"mass audience movies\\". Meanwhile, director Robert Morin made himself known with personal movies like Requiem for a Handsome Bastard (Requiem pour un beau sans-coeur). Claude Jutra committed suicide in the 1980s after a struggle with Alzheimer's disease, and Gilles Carle became too sick to direct. The 1990s and 2000s 1990-2002 saw the solidification of Quebec's movie industry. Independent films such as Denis Villeneuve's Maelstr√∂m, Denis Chouinard's L'Ange de goudron, and Un crabe dans la t√™te caught the media's attention. In 1994, Pierre Falardeau's Octobre told a fictionalized version of the October Crisis from the point of view of the Chenier Cell, the FLQ terrorist cell who in 1970 kidnapped and executed Quebec minister and Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte. Home-made blockbusters came in 2000s and begin to dominate their home market, putting American blockbusters in second place. S√©raphin: un homme et son p√©ch√©, directed by Charles Binam√©, was a major success at the box office in 2002. The next year, 2003, was called \\"the year of Quebec cinema's rebirth\\" with Denys Arcand winning the foreign film Oscar for The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares), the sequel of The Decline of the American Empire (Le D√©clin de l'empire am√©ricain), and with Gaz Bar Blues and Seducing Doctor Lewis gaining both critical and public acclaim. In 2005, C.R.A.Z.Y. was released, grossing a considerable amount in such a small market, and garnering widespread praise from critics. In 2006, the Quebec-made action-comedy Bon Cop, Bad Cop, a film with dialogue in both French and English, took over the title of most popular Canadian film at the Canadian box office. Sales for Bon Cop, Bad Cop have totalled $13 million across the country. The previous Quebec film to hold this honour was Les Boys. In 2007, Arcand's Days of Darkness (L'√Çge des t√©n√®bres) was selected as the closing film for the Cannes Film Festival. In 2009, De p√®re en flic (English: Father and Guns) matched the movie Bon Cop Bad Cop to become the highest- grossing French language film in Canadian history. The 2010s The 2010s were marked by three consecutive Academy Award nominations for Quebecois films in the Foreign Language category,Chris Knight, \\"Canadian director Kim Nguyen on his Oscar nomination for War Witch (Rebelle): ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre clearly the underdog‚Äô ,\\" National Post, 10 January 2013, URL accessed 6 August 2013. namely for Incendies (2010), Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012). War Witch director Kim Nguyen proclaimed \\"People around the world are looking at Quebec cinema now and waiting for the next director to come out of here. This has a tremendous impact on a country's recognition outside of its borders\\". University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar, Inch'Allah (2012) and War Witch, represent a break from focus on local history to more global concerns. In May 2016, Xavier Dolan became the first Quebec filmmaker to win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, for It's Only the End of the World. It also later won Best Film at the inaugural Prix Iris, which replaced the Jutra Awards for Quebec films, with new categories for Casting, Visual Effects, Revelation of the Year and Documentary Editing and Cinematography, and a Public Prix, chosen by viewers' votes.

Shortz (born August 26, 1952) is an American puzzle creator and editor and crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times. Early life and education Will Shortz was born and raised on an Arabian horse farm in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was drawn to puzzles at an early age; in eighth grade he wrote a paper titled ‚ÄúPuzzles as a Profession.‚Äù (The paper earned him a B+.) At age 13, Shortz wrote to Language on Vacation author Dmitri Borgmann for advice on how to pursue a career in puzzles. He graduated from Indiana University in 1974, and is the only person known to hold a college degree in enigmatology, the study of puzzles. Shortz achieved this by designing his own curriculum through Indiana University's Individualized Major Program. He also earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law (1977), but did not sit for the bar exam and began a career in puzzles instead. Career Shortz began his career at Penny Press Magazines, then moved to Games magazine for 15 years, serving as its editor from 1989‚Äì1993. He has been the crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times since 1993 (the fourth in the paper's history, following Eugene Thomas Maleska), and has been the puzzle master on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday since the program was started in 1987. He is the founder of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (1978), and has served as its director since that time.

Despite varied interpretations of this term, it is primarily associated with the ideological notion of world governance only in the sense of new collective efforts to identify, understand, or address global problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve. The phrase \\"new world order\\" or similar language was used in the period toward the end of the First World War in relation to Woodrow Wilson's vision for international peace;A search of the American Presidency Project for the exact phrase \\"new world order\\" returned no hits for President Woodrow Wilson, but it is the case that Wilson used the phrase \\"new order of the world\\" in a speech given September 9, 1919 to the University of Minnesota Armory in Minneapolis, and that he also used the phrase \\"new international order\\" in a speech given February 11, 1918 to Congress shortly after the Fourteen Points Speech on January 8, 1918. Wilson also used the phrase, \\"new order\\" in several speeches when speaking about his aspirations and vision for the future. It is also the case that diplomat William C. Bullitt did use the exact phrase \\"new world order\\" in correspondence dated February 3, 1918 and kept within the Woodrow Wilson Papers by the Library of Congress. One could also search for \\"new world order\\" within The Papers of Woodrow Wilson Digital Edition from the Rotunda service of the University of Virginia Press to see a number of other uses of the phrase by various people around the end of the First World War. Note that content within The Papers of Woodrow Wilson Digital Edition is generally available after registration only on a trial basis, but that institutional users can get further access. Wilson called for a League of Nations to prevent aggression and conflict. The phrase was used to a degree at the end of World War II when describing the plans for the United Nations and the Bretton Woods system partly because of its negative associations with the failed League of Nations. However, many commentators have applied the term retroactively to the order put in place by the World War II victors as a \\"new world order.\\" The most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the Cold War. Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush used the term to try to define the nature of the post-Cold War era and the spirit of great power cooperation that they hoped might materialize. Gorbachev's initial formulation was wide-ranging and idealistic, but his ability to press for it was severely limited by the internal crisis of the Soviet system. In comparison, Bush's vision was not less circumscribed: \\"A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known\\". However, given the new unipolar status of the United States, Bush's vision was realistic in saying that \\"there is no substitute for American leadership\\". The Gulf War of 1991 was regarded as the first test of the new world order: \\"Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. [...] The Gulf war put this new world to its first test\\".Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' Survival, 33/3, (1991): p 195-196.  Historical usage  Woodrow Wilson and the Origin of the League of Nations The phrase \\"new world order\\" was explicitly used in connection with Woodrow Wilson's global zeitgeist during the period just after World War I during the formation of the League of Nations. \\"The war to end all wars\\" had been a powerful catalyst in international politics, and many felt the world could simply no longer operate as it once had. World War I had been justified not only in terms of U.S. national interest, but in moral terms--to \\"make the world safe for democracy\\". After the war, Wilson argued for a new world order which transcended traditional great power politics, instead emphasizing collective security, democracy and self-determination. However, the United States Senate rejected membership of the League of Nations, which Wilson believed to be the key to a new world order. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued that American policy should be based on human nature \\"as it is, not as it ought to be\\".\\"The bloodhounds of history.\\" The Economist. April 10, 1998. Nazi activist and future German leader Adolf Hitler also used the term in 1928.https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-0IryYbwVIPGFodSS/Hitler%20-%20New%20World%20Order%20%281928%29_djvu.txt Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill during the meeting that would result in the Atlantic Charter, precursor to the Bretton Woods system The term fell from use when it became clear the League was not living up to expectations and as a consequence was used very little during the formation of the United Nations. Former United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim felt that this new world order was a projection of the American dream into Europe and that in its na√Øvet√© the idea of a new order had been used to further the parochial interests of Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau, thus ensuring the League's eventual failure.Kurt Waldheim. \\"The United Nations: The Tarnished Image.\\" Foreign Affairs (1984, Fall) Although some have claimed the phrase was not used at all, Virginia Gildersleeve, the sole female delegate to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945, did use it in an interview with The New York Times. The phrase was used by some in retrospect when assessing the creation of the post-World War II set of international institutions, including the United Nations; the U.S. security alliances such as NATO; the Bretton Woods system of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and even the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan were seen as characterizing or comprising this new order. H. G. Wells wrote a book published in 1940 entitled The New World Order. It addressed the ideal of a world without war in which law and order emanated from a world governing body and examined various proposals and ideas. Franklin D. Roosevelt in his \\"Armistice Day Address Before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\\" on November 11, 1940 referred to Novus ordo seclorum, inscribed on the Great Seal of the United States and traced to antiquity. By this phrase, Virgil announced the Augustan Golden Age. That Age was the dawn of the divine universal monarchy, but Roosevelt on that occasion promised to take the world order into the opposite democratic direction led by the United States and Britain.Frankline Delano Roosevelt, \\"Armistice Day Address Before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,\\" (November 11, 1940), http://greatseal.com/mottoes/neworderFDR.html On June 6, 1966, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy used the phrase \\"new world society\\" in his Day of Affirmation Address in South Africa.  Post-Cold War \\"new world order\\"  The phrase \\"new world order\\" as used to herald in the post-Cold War era had no developed or substantive definition. There appear to have been three distinct periods in which it was progressively redefined, first by the Soviets and later by the United States before the Malta Conference and again after George H. W. Bush's speech of September 11, 1990. # At first, the new world order dealt almost exclusively with nuclear disarmament and security arrangements. Mikhail Gorbachev would then expand the phrase to include United Nations strengthening and great power cooperation on a range of North‚ÄìSouth economic, and security problems. Implications for NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and European integration were subsequently included. # The Malta Conference collected these various expectations and they were fleshed out in more detail by the press. German reunification, human rights and the polarity of the international system were then included. # The Gulf War crisis refocused the term on superpower cooperation and regional crises. Economic North‚ÄìSouth problems, the integration of the Soviets into the international system and the changes in economic and military polarity received greater attention. = Mikhail Gorbachev's formulation = The first press reference to the phrase came from Russo-Indian talks on November 21, 1988. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi used the term in reference to the commitments made by the Soviet Union through the Declaration of Delhi of two years previous. The new world order which he describes is characterized by \\"non-violence and the principles of peaceful coexistence\\". He also includes the possibility of a sustained peace, an alternative to the nuclear balance of terror, dismantling of nuclear weapons systems, significant cuts in strategic arms and eventually a general and complete disarmament.\\"Gorbachev and Indian Prime Minister Hold Talks on November 19 Speeches Made at Peace Prize.\\" November 21, 1988 Three days later, a Guardian article quotes NATO Secretary General Manfred W√∂rner as saying that the Soviets have come close to accepting NATO's doctrine of military stability based on a mix of nuclear as well as conventional arms. In his opinion, this would spur the creation of \\"a new security framework\\" and a move towards \\"a new world order\\".\\"Soviets 'in arms strategy shift'\\", The Guardian, November 24, 1988 However, the principal statement creating the new world order concept came from Mikhail Gorbachev's December 7, 1988 speech to the United Nations General Assembly. His formulation included an extensive list of ideas in creating a new order. He advocated strengthening the central role of the United Nations and the active involvement of all members--the Cold War had prevented the United Nations and its Security Council from performing their roles as initially envisioned. The de-ideologizing of relations among states was the mechanism through which this new level of cooperation could be achieved. Concurrently, Gorbachev recognized only one world economy‚Äîessentially an end to economic blocs. Furthermore, he advocated Soviet entry into several important international organizations, such as the CSCE and International Court of Justice. Reinvigoration of the United Nations peacekeeping role and recognition that superpower cooperation can and will lead to the resolution of regional conflicts was especially key in his conception of cooperation. He argued that the use of force or the threat of the use of force was no longer legitimate and that the strong must demonstrate restraint toward the weak. As the major powers of the world, he foresaw the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, India, China, Japan and Brazil. He asked for cooperation on environmental protection, on debt relief for developing countries, on disarmament of nuclear weapons, on preservation of the ABM treaty and on a convention for the elimination of chemical weapons. At the same time, he promised the significant withdrawal of Soviet forces from Eastern Europe and Asia as well as an end to the jamming of Radio Liberty. Gorbachev described a phenomenon that could be described as a global political awakening: In the press, Gorbachev was compared to Woodrow Wilson giving the Fourteen Points, to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill promulgating the Atlantic Charter and to George Marshall and Harry S. Truman building the Western Alliance. While visionary, his speech was to be approached with caution as he was seen as attempting a fundamental redefinition of international relationships, on economic and environmental levels. His support \\"for independence, democracy and social justice\\" was highlighted, but the principle message taken from his speech was that of a new world order based on pluralism, tolerance and cooperation.\\"Vision on the World Stage\\", Washington Post, November 9, 1988 A month later, Time Magazine ran a longer analysis of the speech and its possible implications. The promises of a new world order based on the forswearing of military use of force was viewed partially as a threat, which might \\"lure the West toward complacency\\" and \\"woo Western Europe into neutered neutralism\\". However, the more overriding threat was that the West did not yet have any imaginative response to Gorbachev‚Äîleaving the Soviets with the moral initiative and solidifying Gorbachev's place as \\"the most popular world leader in much of Western Europe\\". The article noted as important his de-ideologized stance, willingness to give up use of force, commitment to troop cuts in Eastern Europe (accelerating political change there) and compliance with the ABM treaty. According to the article, the new world order seemed to imply shifting of resources from military to domestic needs; a world community of states based on the rule of law; a dwindling of security alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact; and an inevitable move toward European integration. The author of the Time article felt that George H. W. Bush should counter Gorbachev's \\"common home\\" rhetoric toward the Europeans with the idea of \\"common ideals\\", turning an alliance of necessity into one of shared values. Gorbachev's repudiation of expansionism leaves the United States in a good position, no longer having to support anti-communist dictators and able to pursue better goals such as the environment; nonproliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; reducing famine and poverty; and resolving regional conflicts.\\"The Gorbachev Challenge\\", Time Magazine, December 19, 1988 In A World Transformed, Bush and Brent Scowcroft's similarly concern about losing leadership to Gorbachev is noted and they worry that the Europeans might stop following the U.S. if it appears to drag its feet.George H.W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft. A World Transformed, , pp. 42‚Äì43. As Europe passed into the new year, the implications of the new world order for the European Community surfaced. The European Community was seen as the vehicle for integrating East and West in such a manner that they could \\"pool their resources and defend their specific interests in dealings with those superpowers on something more like equal terms\\". It would be less exclusively tied to the U.S. and stretch \\"from Brest to Brest-Litovsk, or at least from Dublin to Lublin\\".\\"The Dog that Failed to Bark\\", Financial Times, January 10, 1989 By July 1989, newspapers were still criticizing Bush for his lack of response to Gorbachev's proposals. Bush visited Europe, but \\"left undefined for those on both sides of the Iron Curtain his vision for the new world order\\", leading commentators to view the U.S. as over-cautious and reactive, rather than pursuing long-range strategic goals.\\"Still searching for the Bush Doctrine\\", Boston Globe, July 23, 1989 = Malta Conference = George H. W. Bush In A World Transformed, Bush and Scowcroft detail their crafting of a strategy aimed at flooding Gorbachev with proposals at the Malta Conference to catch him off guard, preventing the U.S. from coming out of the summit on the defensive.A World Transformed, pp. 163‚Äì167. The Malta Conference on December 2‚Äì3, 1989 reinvigorated discussion of the new world order. Various new concepts arose in the press as elements on the new order. Commentators expected the replacement of containment with superpower cooperation. This cooperation might then tackle problems such as reducing armaments and troop deployments, settling regional disputes, stimulating economic growth, lessening East‚ÄìWest trade restrictions, the inclusion of the Soviets in international economic institutions and protecting the environment. Pursuant to superpower cooperation, a new role for NATO was forecast, with the organization perhaps changing into a forum for negotiation and treaty verification, or even a wholesale dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact following the resurrection of the four-power framework from World War II (i.e. the U.S., United Kingdom, France and Russia). However, continued U.S. military presence in Europe was expected to help contain \\"historic antagonisms\\", thus making possible a new European order.Compiled from: * \\"U.S. must get involved in shaping a new world order\\", Boston Globe, December 3, 1989 * \\"New World Order Galloping Into Position\\", Washington Post, February 25, 1990 * \\"A Workmanlike Summit\\", New York Times, June 5, 1990 In Europe, German reunification was seen as part of the new order. However, Strobe Talbott saw it as more of a brake on the new era and believed Malta to be a holding action on part of the superpowers designed to forestall the \\"new world order\\" because of the German question.\\"American Abroad; Braking the Juggernaut\\", Time Magazine, December 18, 1989 Political change in Eastern Europe also arose on the agenda. The Eastern Europeans believed that the new world order did not signify superpower leadership, but that superpower dominance was coming to an end.\\"Soviet hopes are undaunted\\", Boston Globe, December 3, 1989 In general, the new security structure arising from superpower cooperation seemed to indicate to observers that the new world order would be based on the principles of political liberty, self-determination and non-intervention. This would mean an end to the sponsoring of military conflicts in third countries, restrictions on global arms sales, and greater engagement in the Middle East (especially regarding Syria, Palestine and Israel). The U.S. might use this opportunity to more emphatically promote human rights in China and South Africa. Economically, debt relief was expected to be a significant issue as East‚ÄìWest competition would give way to North‚ÄìSouth cooperation. Economic tripolarity would arise with the U.S., Germany and Japan as the three motors of world growth. Meanwhile, the Soviet social and economic crisis was manifestly going to limit its ability to project power abroad, thus necessitating continued U.S. leadership. Commentators assessing the results of the Conference and how the pronouncements measured up to expectations, were underwhelmed. Bush was criticized for taking refuge behind notions of \\"status quo-plus\\" rather than a full commitment to new world order. Others noted that Bush thus far failed to satisfy the out-of-control \\"soaring expectations\\" that Gorbachev's speech unleashed. = Gulf War and Bush's formulation = Bush greeting troops on the eve of the First Gulf War Bush started to take the initiative from Gorbachev during the run-up to the Persian Gulf War, when he began to define the elements of the new world order as he saw it and link the new order's success to the international community's response in Kuwait. Initial agreement by the Soviets to allow action against Saddam Hussein highlighted this linkage in the press. The Washington Post declared that this superpower cooperation demonstrates that the Soviet Union has joined the international community and that in the new world order Saddam faces not just the U.S., but the international community itself.\\"Summit Decision Signals Superpower Cooperation\\", Washington Post, September 2, 1990 A New York Times editorial was the first to assert that at stake in the collective response to Saddam was \\"nothing less than the new world order which Bush and other leaders struggle to shape\\".\\"The Month that Shook the World\\", New York Times, September 2, 1990 In A World Transformed, Scowcroft notes that Bush even offered to have Soviet troops amongst the coalition forces liberating Kuwait. Bush places the fate of the new world order on the ability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to respond to Hussein's aggression.A World Transformed, pp. 361‚Äì364. The idea that the Persian Gulf War would usher in the new world order began to take shape. Bush notes that the \\"premise [was] that the United States henceforth would be obligated to lead the world community to an unprecedented degree, as demonstrated by the Iraqi crisis, and that we should attempt to pursue our national interests, wherever possible, within a framework of concert with our friends and the international community\\".A World Transformed, pp. 399‚Äì400. On March 6, 1991, President Bush addressed Congress in a speech often cited as the Bush administration's principal policy statement on the new world order in the Middle East following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.Michael Oren, Power, Faith and Fantasy, p. 569, 2011, W W Norton & Son, Michael Oren summarizes the speech, saying: \\"The president proceeded to outline his plan for maintaining a permanent U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, for providing funds for Middle East development, and for instituting safeguards against the spread of unconventional weapons. The centerpiece of his program, however, was the achievement of an Arab-Israeli treaty based on the territory- for-peace principle and the fulfillment of Palestinian rights\\". As a first step, Bush announced his intention to reconvene the international peace conference in Madrid. A pivotal point came with Bush's September 11, 1990 \\"Toward a New World Order\\" speech (full text) to a joint session of Congress. This time it was Bush, not Gorbachev, whose idealism was compared to Woodrow Wilson and to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the creation of the United Nations. Key points picked up in the press were: * Commitment to U.S. strength, such that it can lead the world toward rule of law, rather than use of force. The Gulf crisis was seen as a reminder that the U.S. must continue to lead and that military strength does matter, but that the resulting new world order should make military force less important in the future. * Soviet‚ÄìAmerican partnership in cooperation toward making the world safe for democracy, making possible the goals of the United Nations for the first time since its inception. Some countered that this was unlikely and that ideological tensions would remain, such that the two superpowers could be partners of convenience for specific and limited goals only. The inability of the Soviet Union to project force abroad was another factor in skepticism toward such a partnership. * Another caveat raised was that the new world order was based not on U.S.-Soviet cooperation, but really on Bush-Gorbachev cooperation and that the personal diplomacy made the entire concept exceedingly fragile. * Future cleavages were to be economic, not ideological, with the First and Second World cooperating to contain regional instability in the Third World. Russia could become an ally against economic assaults from Asia, Islamic terrorism and drugs from Latin America. * Soviet integration into world economic institutions such as the G7 and establishment of ties with the European Community. * Restoration of German sovereignty and Cambodia's acceptance of the United Nations Security Council's peace plan on the day previous to the speech were seen as signs of what to expect in the new world order. * The reemergence of Germany and Japan as members of the great powers and concomitant reform of the United Nations Security Council was seen as necessary for great power cooperation and reinvigorated United Nations leadership * Europe was seen as taking the lead on building their own world order while the U.S. was relegated to the sidelines. The rationale for U.S. presence on the continent was vanishing and the Persian Gulf crisis was seen as incapable of rallying Europe. Instead, Europe was discussing the European Community, the CSCE and relations with the Soviet Union. Gorbachev even proposed an all-European security council to replace the CSCE, in effect superseding the increasingly irrelevant NATO. * A very few postulated a bi- polar new order of U.S. power and United Nations moral authority, the first as global policeman, the second as global judge and jury. The order would be collectivist in which decisions and responsibility would be shared. These were the common themes which emerged from reporting about Bush's speech and its implications.Compiled from: * \\"Evoking the memory of Wilson and 'a new world order'\\", Boston Globe, September 12, 1990 * \\"Superpowers to Superpartners\\", Newsweek, September 17, 1990 * \\"Steps to a new world order\\", Financial Times, September 17, 1990 * \\"U.S. leads the new world order\\", Toronto Star, September 19, 1990 * \\"Europe choreographs new world order, but Bush is out of step\\", Boston Globe, November 21 Critics held that Bush and Baker remained too vague about what exactly the order entailed: The New York Times observed that the American left was calling the new world order a \\"rationalization for imperial ambitions\\" in the Middle East while the right rejected new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of United Nations revival.\\"George Bush Meet Woodrow Wilson\\", New York Times, November 20, 1990 Pat Buchanan predicted that the Persian Gulf War would in fact be the demise of the new world order, the concept of United Nations peacekeeping and the U.S.'s role as global policeman.A World Transformed, pp. 426. The Los Angeles Times reported that the speech signified more than just the rhetoric about superpower cooperation. In fact, the deeper reality of the new world order was the U.S.' emergence \\"as the single greatest power in a multipolar world\\". Moscow was crippled by internal problems and thus unable to project power abroad. While hampered by economic malaise, the U.S. was militarily unconstrained for the first time since the end of World War II. Militarily, it was now a unipolar world as illustrated by the Persian Gulf crisis. While diplomatic rhetoric stressed a U.S.-Soviet partnership, the U.S. was deploying troops to Saudi Arabia (a mere 700 miles from the Soviet frontier) and was preparing for war against a former Soviet client state. Further, U.S. authority over the Soviets was displayed in 1. The unification of Germany, withdrawal of Soviet forces, and almost open appeal to Washington for aid in managing the Soviet transition to democracy; 2. Withdrawal of Soviet support for Third World clients; and 3) Soviets seeking economic aid through membership in Western international economic and trade communities.\\"With Moscow Crippled, U.S. Emerges as Top Power\\", LA Times, September 12, 1990 The speech was indeed pivotal but the meaning hidden. A pivotal interpretation of the speech came the same month a week later on September 18, 1990. Charles Krauthammer then delivered a lecture in Washington in which he introduced the idea of American unipolarity. By the fall 1990, his essay was published in Foreign Affairs titled \\"The Unipolar Moment\\".Foreign Affairs, 69/5: (Winter 1990/91), p 23-33. It had few to do with Kuwait. The main point was the following: In fact, as Lawrence Freedman commented in 1991, a \\"unipolar\\" world is now taken seriously. He details: Washington's capacity to exert overwhelming military power and leadership over a multinational coalition provides the \\"basis for a Pax Americana\\". Indeed, one of the problems with Bush's phrase was that \\"a call for 'order' from Washington chills practically everyone else, because it sounds suspiciously like a Pax Americana\\".Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' Survival, 33/3, (1991): p 196-197. The unipolarity, Krauthammer noted, is the \\"most striking feature of the post-Cold War world\\". The article proved to be epochal. Twelve years later, Krauthammer in \\"The Unipolar Moment Revisited\\"National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5-20. stated that the \\"moment\\" is lasting and lasting with \\"acceleration\\".National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 6. He replied to those who still refused to acknowledge the fact of unipolarity: \\"If today's American primacy does not constitute unipolarity, then nothing ever will\\". In 1990, Krauthammer had estimated that the \\"moment\\" will last forty years at best, but he adjusted the estimation in 2002: \\"Today, it seems rather modest. The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era\\".National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 17. On the latter occasion, Krauthammer added perhaps his most significant comment‚Äîthe new unipolar world order represents a \\"unique to modern history\\" structure.National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5.  Presaging the Iraq War of 2003  James Baker, Secretary of State under George H. W. Bush The Economist published an article explaining the drive toward the Persian Gulf War in terms presaging the run-up to the Iraq War of 2003. The author notes directly that despite the coalition, in the minds of most governments this is the U.S.' war and George W. Bush that \\"chose to stake his political life on defeating Mr Hussein\\". An attack on Iraq would certainly shatter Bush's alliance, they assert, predicting calls from United Nations Security Council members saying that diplomacy should have been given more time and that they will not wish to allow a course of action \\"that leaves America sitting too prettily as sole remaining superpower\\". When the unanimity of the Security Council ends, \\"all that lovely talk about the new world order\\" will too. When casualties mount, \\"Bush will be called a warmonger, an imperialist and a bully\\". The article goes on to say that Bush and James Baker's speechifying cannot save the new world order once they launch a controversial war. It closes noting that a wide consensus is not necessary for U.S. action‚Äîonly a hardcore of supporters, namely Saudi Arabia, Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Egypt and Britain. The rest need only not interfere.\\"New World Order Inc\\", The Economist, November 10, 1990 In a passage with similar echoes of the future, Bush and Scowcroft explain in A World Transformed the role of the United Nations Secretary-General in attempting to avert the Persian Gulf War. Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar arrived at Camp David to ask what he could do to head off the war. Bush told him that it was important that we get full implementation on every United Nations resolution: \\"If we compromise, we weaken the UN and our own credibility in building this new world order,\\" I said. \\"I think Saddam Hussein doesn't believe force will be used‚Äîor if it is, he can produce a stalemate\\". Additional meetings between Baker or P√©rez and the Iraqis are rejected for fear that they will simply come back empty-handed once again. Bush feared that Javier will be cover for Hussein's manipulations. P√©rez suggested another Security Council meeting, but Bush saw no reason for one.A World Transformed, pp. 440. = Following the Persian Gulf War = Following the Persian Gulf War which was seen as the crucible in which great power cooperation and collective security would emerge the new norms of the era--several academic assessments of the \\"new world order\\" idea were published. John Lewis Gaddis, a Cold War historian, wrote in Foreign Affairs about what he saw as the key characteristics of the potential new order, namely unchallenged American primacy, increasing integration, resurgent nationalism and religiosity, a diffusion of security threats and collective security. He casts the fundamental challenge as one of integration versus fragmentation and the concomitant benefits and dangers associated with each. Changes in communications, the international economic system, the nature of security threats and the rapid spread of new ideas would prevent nations from retreating into isolation. In light of this, Gaddis sees a chance for the democratic peace predicted by liberal international relations theorists to come closer to reality. However, he illustrates that not only is the fragmentary pressure of nationalism manifest in the former Communist bloc countries and the Third World, but it is also a considerable factor in the West. Further, a revitalized Islam could play both integrating and fragmenting roles--emphasizing common identity, but also contributing to new conflicts that could resemble the Lebanese Civil War. The integration coming from the new order could also aggravate ecological, demographic and epidemic threats. National self-determination, leading to the breakup and reunification of states (such as Yugoslavia on one hand and Germany on the other) could signal abrupt shifts in the balance of power with a destabilizing effect. Integrated markets, especially energy markets, are now a security liability for the world economic system as events affecting energy security in one part of the globe could threaten countries far removed from potential conflicts. Finally, diffusion of security threats required a new security paradigm involving low- intensity, but more frequent deployment of peacekeeping troops--a type of mission that is hard to sustain under budgetary or public opinion pressure. Gaddis called for aid to Eastern European countries, updated security and economic regimes for Europe, United Nations-based regional conflict resolution, a slower pace of international economic integration and paying off the U.S. debt.John Lewis Gaddis. \\"Toward the Post‚ÄìCold War World.\\" Foreign Affairs 1991, Spring However, statesman Strobe Talbott wrote of the new world order that it was only in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War that the United Nations took a step toward redefining its role to take account of both interstate relations and intrastate events. Furthermore, he asserted that it was only as an unintended postscript to Desert Storm that Bush gave meaning to the \\"new world order\\" slogan. By the end of the year, Bush stopped talking about a new world order and his advisers explained that he had dropped the phrase because he felt it suggested more enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the planet than he actually felt. As an antidote to the uncertainties of the world, he wanted to stress the old verities of territorial integrity, national sovereignty and international stability.Strobe Talbott. \\"Post-Victory Blues.\\" Foreign Affairs. December 1991 January 1992 David Gergen suggested at the time that it was the recession of 1991‚Äì1992 which finally killed the new world order idea within the White House. The economic downturn took a deeper psychological toll than expected while domestic politics were increasingly frustrated by paralysis, with the result that the United States toward the end of 1991 turned increasingly pessimistic, inward and nationalistic.David Gergen. \\"America's Missed Opportunities.\\" Foreign Affairs. December 1991 January 1992 In 1992, Hans K√∂chler published a critical assessment of the notion of the \\"new world order\\", describing it as an ideological tool of legitimation of the global exercise of power by the U.S. in a unipolar environment.Hans K√∂chler. Democracy and the New World Order. Studies in International Relations, XIX. Vienna: International Progress Organization, 1993. . (Translation of the German edition of 1992) In Joseph Nye's analysis (1992), the collapse of the Soviet Union did not issue in a new world order per se, but rather simply allowed for the reappearance of the liberal institutional order that was supposed to have come into effect in 1945. However, this success of this order was not a fait accomplis.Joseph S. Nye, Jr. \\"What New World Order.\\" Foreign Affairs. 1992, Spring Three years later, John Ikenberry would reaffirm Nye's idea of a reclamation of the ideal post- World War II order, but would dispute the nay-sayers who had predicted post- Cold War chaos.G. John Ikenberry. \\"The Myth of Post‚ÄìCold War Chaos.\\" Foreign Affairs. May 1996 / June 1996 By 1997, Anne-Marie Slaughter produced an analysis calling the restoration of the post-World War II order a \\"chimera [...] infeasible at best and dangerous at worst\\". In her view, the new order was not a liberal institutionalist one, but one in which state authority disaggregated and decentralized in the face of globalization.Anne-Marie Slaughter. \\"The Real New World Order.\\" Foreign Affairs. September 1997 / October 1997 Samuel Huntington wrote critically of the \\"new world order\\" and of Francis Fukuyama's End of History theory in The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order: :The expectation of harmony was widely shared. Political and intellectual leaders elaborated similar views. The Berlin wall had come down, communist regimes had collapsed, the United Nations was to assume a new importance, the former Cold War rivals would engage in \\"partnership\\" and a \\"grand bargain,\\" peacekeeping and peacemaking would be the order of the day. The President of the world's leading country proclaimed the \\"new world order\\"... :The moment of euphoria at the end of the Cold War generated an illusion of harmony, which was soon revealed to be exactly that. The world became different in the early 1990s, but not necessarily more peaceful. Change was inevitable; progress was not... The illusion of harmony at the end of that Cold War was soon dissipated by the multiplication of ethnic conflicts and \\"ethnic cleansing,\\" the breakdown of law and order, the emergence of new patterns of alliance and conflict among states, the resurgence of neo-communist and neo-fascist movements, intensification of religious fundamentalism, the end of the \\"diplomacy of smiles\\" and \\"policy of yes\\" in Russia's relations with the West, the inability of the United Nations and the United States to suppress bloody local conflicts, and the increasing assertiveness of a rising China. In the five years after the Berlin wall came down, the word \\"genocide\\" was heard far more often than in any five years of the Cold War. :The one harmonious world paradigm is clearly far too divorced from reality to be a useful guide to the post‚ÄìCold War world. Two Worlds: Us and Them. While one-world expectations appear at the end of major conflicts, the tendency to think in terms of two worlds recurs throughout human history. People are always tempted to divide people into us and them, the in-group and the other, our civilization and those barbarians.Samuel P. Huntington. The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order . Simon & Schuster: New York. January 28, 1998. . pp. 7‚Äì8. Despite the criticisms of the new world order concept, ranging from its practical unworkability to its theoretical incoherence, Bill Clinton not only signed on to the idea of the \\"new world order\\", but dramatically expanded the concept beyond Bush's formulation. The essence of Clinton's election year critique was that Bush had done too little, not too much.David C. Hendrickson. \\"The Recovery of Internationalism.\\" Foreign Affairs. September 1994 / October 1994 American intellectual Noam Chomsky, author of the 1994 book World Orders Old and New, often describes the \\"new world order\\" as a post-Cold-War era in which \\"the New World gives the orders\\". Commenting on the 1999 U.S.-NATO bombing of Serbia, he writes: Following the rise of Boris Yeltsin eclipsing Gorbachev and the election victory of Clinton over Bush, the term \\"new world order\\" fell from common usage. It was replaced by competing similar concepts about how the post-Cold War order would develop. Prominent among these were the ideas of the \\"era of globalization\\", the \\"unipolar moment\\", the \\"end of history\\" and the \\"Clash of Civilizations\\".Adam Garfinkle. \\"The Present Opportunity.\\" The National Interest. 2001 Fall = Viewed in retrospect = A 2001 paper in Presidential Studies Quarterly examined the idea of the \\"new world order\\" as it was presented by the Bush administration (mostly ignoring previous uses by Gorbachev). Their conclusion was that Bush really only ever had three firm aspects to the new world order: # Checking the offensive use of force. # Promoting collective security. # Using great power cooperation. These were not developed into a policy architecture, but came about incrementally as a function of domestic, personal and global factors. Because of the somewhat overblown expectations for the new world order in the media, Bush was widely criticized for lacking vision.Eric A. Miller and Steve A. Yetiv, \\"The New World Order in Theory and Practice: The Bush Administration's Worldview in Transition.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly, March 2001 The Gulf crisis is seen as the catalyst for Bush's development and implementation of the new world order concept. The authors note that before the crisis the concept remained \\"ambiguous, nascent, and unproven\\" and that the U.S had not assumed a leadership role with respect to the new order. Essentially, the Cold War's end was the permissive cause for the new world order, but the Persian Gulf crisis was the active cause. Dick Cheney, then Secretary of Defense under George H. W. Bush They reveal that in August 1990 U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Charles W. Freeman Jr. sent a diplomatic cable to Washington from Saudi Arabia in which he argued that U.S. conduct in the Persian Gulf crisis would determine the nature of the world. Bush would then refer to the \\"new world order\\" at least 42 times from the summer of 1990 to the end of March 1991. They also note that Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney gave three priorities to the Senate on fighting the Persian Gulf War, namely prevent further aggression, protect oil supplies and further a new world order. The authors note that the new world order did not emerge in policy speeches until after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, maintaining that the concept was clearly not critical in the U.S. decision to deploy. John H. Sununu later indicated that the administration wanted to refrain from talking about the concept until Soviet collapse was more clear. A reversal of Soviet collapse would have been the death knell for the new order. Bush and Scowcroft were frustrated by the exaggerated and distorted ideas surrounding the new world order. They did not intend to suggest that the U.S. would yield significant influence to the United Nations, or that they expected the world to enter an era of peace and tranquility. They preferred multilateralism, but did not reject unilateralism. The new world order did not signal peace, but a \\"challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay\\". Bush's drive toward the Persian Gulf War was based on the world making a clear choice. Baker recalls that UNSCR 660's \\"language was simply and crystal clear, purposely designed by us to frame the vote as being for or against aggression\\". Bush's motivation centered around 1. The dangers of appeasement; and 2. Failure to check aggression could spark further aggression. Bush repeatedly invoked images of World War II in this connection and became very emotional over Iraqi atrocities being committed in Kuwait. He also believed that failure to check Iraqi aggression would lead to more challenges to the U.S.-favored status quo and global stability. While the end of the Cold War increased U.S. security globally, it remained vulnerable to regional threats. Furthermore, Washington believed that addressing the Iraqi threat would help reassert U.S. predominance in light of growing concerns about relative decline, following the resurgence of Germany and Japan. Eduard Shevardnadze, then Soviet Foreign Minister The Gulf War was also framed as a test case for United Nations credibility. As a model for dealing with aggressors, Scowcroft believed that the United States ought to act in a way that others can trust and thus get United Nations support. It was critical that the U.S. not look like it was throwing its weight around. Great power cooperation and United Nations support would collapse if the U.S. marched on the Baghdad to try to remake Iraq. However, practically, superpower cooperation was limited. For example, when the U.S. deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze became furious at not being consulted. By 1992, the authors note that the U.S. was already abandoning the idea of collective action. The leaked draft of the Wolfowitz-Libby 1992 Defense Guidance Report effectively confirmed this shift as it called for a unilateral role for the U.S. in world affairs, focusing on preserving American dominance. In closing A World Transformed, Scowcroft sums up what his expectations were for the new world order. He states that the U.S. has the strength and the resources to pursue its own interests, but has a disproportionate responsibility to use its power in pursuit of the common good as well as an obligation to lead and to be involved. The U.S. is perceived as uncomfortable in exercising its power and ought to work to create predictability and stability in international relations. The U.S. needs not be embroiled in every conflict, but ought to aid in developing multilateral responses to them. The U.S. can unilaterally broker disputes, but ought to act whenever possible in concert with equally committed partners to deter major aggression.A World Transformed, pp. 565‚Äì566.  Recent political usage  Henry Kissinger stated in 1994: \\"The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions\\".World Affairs Council Press Conference, Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, April 19, 1994 Then on January 5, 2009, when asked on television by CNBC anchors about what he suggests Barack Obama focus on during the current Israeli crises he replied that it is a time to reevaluate American foreign policy and that \\"he can give new impetus to American foreign policy. [...] I think that his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period, when really a 'new world order' can be created. It's a great opportunity. It isn't such a crisis\\". Former United Kingdom Prime Minister and British Middle East envoy Tony Blair stated on November 13, 2000 in his Mansion House speech: \\"There is a new world order like it or not\\". He used the term in 2001, November 12, 2001 and 2002. On January 7, 2003, he stated that \\"the call was for a new world order. But a new order presumes a new consensus. It presumes a shared agenda and a global partnership to do it\\". Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) stated on December 17, 2001: \\"This is not the first time the world has faced this question ‚Äì so fundamental and far- reaching. In the 1940s, after the greatest of wars, visionaries in America and elsewhere looked ahead to a new world and ‚Äì in their day and for their times ‚Äì built a new world order\\". Brown also called for a \\"new world order\\" in a 2008 speech in New Delhi to reflect the rise of Asia and growing concerns over global warming and finance. Brown said the new world order should incorporate a better representation of \\"the biggest shift in the balance of economic power in the world in two centuries\\". He went on to say: \\"To succeed now, the post- war rules of the game and the post-war international institutions ‚Äì fit for the Cold War and a world of just 50 states ‚Äì must be radically reformed to fit our world of globalisation\\". He also called for the revamping of post-war global institutions including the World Bank, G8 and International Monetary Fund. Other elements of Brown's formulation include spending ¬£100 million a year on setting up a rapid reaction force to intervene in failed states. He also used the term on January 14, 2007, March 12, 2007, May 15, 2007, June 20, 2007, April 15, 2008 and on April 18, 2008. Brown also used the term in his speech at the G20 Summit in London on April 2, 2009. Iranian President Dr. Ahmadinejad speaking at Columbia University Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called for a \\"new world order\\" based on new ideas, saying the era of tyranny has come to a dead-end. In an exclusive interview with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Ahmadinejad noted that it is time to propose new ideologies for running the world. Iran's stated goal is to establish a new world order based on world peace, global collective security, reciprocity and justice.Iran urges NAM to make collective bids to establish global peace.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said \\"it's time to move from words to action because this is not going to go away. This nation is fighting for its survival, but we are also fighting for world peace and we are also fighting for a Future World Order\\". Turkish President Abdullah G√ºl said: \\"I don't think you can control all the world from one centre, There are big nations. There are huge populations. There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world. So what we have to do is, instead of unilateral actions, act all together, make common decisions and have consultations with the world. A new world order, if I can say it, should emerge\\". On the Colbert Report, guest John King (of CNN) mentioned Obama's \\"New World Order\\" after Stephen Colbert joked about the media's role in getting Obama elected. Some scholars of international relations have advanced the thesis that the declining global influence of the U.S. and the rise of largely illiberal powers such as China threaten the established norms and beliefs of the liberal rule-based world order. They describe three pillars of the prevailing order that are upheld and promoted by the West, namely peaceful international relations (the Westphalian norm), democratic ideals and free-market capitalism. Stewart Patrick suggests that emerging powers, China included, \\"often oppose the political and economic ground rules of the inherited Western liberal order\\" and Elizabeth Economy argues that China is becoming a \\"revolutionary power\\" that is seeking \\"to remake global norms and institutions\\". In contrast, Amitai Etzioni contends that such a world order was never fully consolidated and that \\"the whole thesis that the U.S. is the champion and protector of a liberal rule-based global order and faces illiberal nations that do not buy into and need to be encouraged to accept prevailing norms, is a complex combination of beliefs many in the West truly hold. It is part of an ideological challenge to the legitimacy of the policies and regimes of other nations, mixed with a measure of self-congratulatory exceptionalism\\". Russian political analyst Leonid Grinin believes that despite all the problems, the U.S. will preserve the leading position within a new world order since no other country is able to concentrate so many leader's functions. Yet, he insists that the formation of a new world order will start from an epoch of new coalitions Grinin, Leonid; Ilyin, Ilya V.; Andreev, Alexey I. 2016.

The Latin phrase \\"novus ordo seclorum\\", appearing on the reverse side of the Great Seal since 1782 and on the back of the U.S. one-dollar bill since 1935, translates to \\"New Order of the Ages\\"Lewis and Short, A Latin Dictionary and alludes to the beginning of an era where the United States of America is an independent nation-state; conspiracy theorists claim this is an allusion to the \\"New World Order\\". The New World Order (NWO) in conspiracy theories is the hypothesis of a secretly emerging totalitarian world government. The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government‚Äîwhich will replace sovereign nation-states‚Äîand an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of the New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been alleged to be part of a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination. Before the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end- time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics, such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet, observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues. History of the term =General usage (Pre-Cold War)= During the 20th century, political figures such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill used the term \\"new world order\\" to refer to a new period of history characterised by a dramatic change in world political thought and in the global balance of power after World War I and World War II. The interwar and post-World War II period were seen as opportunities to implement idealistic proposals for global governance by collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to resolve, while nevertheless respecting the right of nations to self-determination. Such collective initiatives manifested in the formation of intergovernmental organizations such as the League of Nations in 1920, the United Nations (UN) in 1945, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, along with international regimes such as the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), implemented to maintain a cooperative balance of power and facilitate reconciliation between nations to prevent the prospect of another global conflict. These cosmopolitan efforts to instill liberal internationalism were regularly criticized and opposed by American paleoconservative business nationalists from the 1930s on. Progressives welcomed international organizations and regimes such as the United Nations in the aftermath of the two World Wars, but argued that these initiatives suffered from a democratic deficit and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another world war but to foster global justice, as the UN was chartered to be a free association of sovereign nation-states rather than a transition to democratic world government. Thus, cosmopolitan activists around the globe, perceiving the IGOs as too ineffectual for global change, formed a world federalist movement. British writer and futurist H. G. Wells went further than progressives in the 1940s, by appropriating and redefining the term \\"new world order\\" as a synonym for the establishment of a technocratic world state and of a planned economy, garnering popularity in state socialist circles. =Usage as reference to a conspiracy (Cold War era)= During the Second Red Scare, both secular and Christian right American agitators, largely influenced by the work of Canadian conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr, increasingly embraced and spread dubious fears of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jews as the alleged driving forces behind an \\"international communist conspiracy\\". The threat of \\"Godless communism\\", in the form of an atheistic, bureaucratic collectivist world government, demonized as the \\"Red Menace\\", became the focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism. The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States, which is that liberals and progressives, with their welfare-state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid, supposedly contribute to a gradual process of global collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communistic/collectivist one-world government. James Warburg, appearing before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1950, famously stated: \\"We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest.\\" Testimony on Wikisource Right-wing populist advocacy groups with a paleoconservative world-view, such as the John Birch Society, disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the United States and the Soviet Union were controlled by a cabal of corporate internationalists, \\"greedy\\" bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using the UN as the vehicle to create a \\"One World Government\\". This anti-globalist conspiracism fueled the campaign for U.S. withdrawal from the UN. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her 1966 booklet The Profound Revolution, traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the establishment of the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1913 by international bankers, whom she claimed later formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 as a shadow government. At the time the booklet was published, many readers would have interpreted \\"international bankers\\" as a reference to a postulated \\"international Jewish banking conspiracy\\" masterminded by the Rothschild family. Arguing that the term \\"New World Order\\" is used by a secretive global elite dedicated to the eradication of the sovereignty of the world's nations, American writer Gary Allen‚Äîin his books None Dare Call It Conspiracy (1971), Rockefeller: Campaigning for the New World Order (1974), and Say \\"No!\\" to the New World Order (1987)‚Äîarticulated the anti-globalist theme of contemporary right-wing conspiracism in the U.S. After the fall of communism in the early 1990s, the de facto subject of New World Order conspiracism shifted from crypto- communists, perceived to be plotting to establish an atheistic world communist government, to globalists, perceived to be plotting to generally implement a collectivist, unified world government ultimately controlled by an untouchable oligarchy of international bankers, corrupt politicians, and corporatists, or alternatively, the United Nations itself. The shift in perception was inspired by growing opposition to corporate internationalism on the American right in the 1990s. In his speech, Toward a New World Order, delivered on 11 September 1990 during a joint session of the US Congress, President George H. W. Bush described his objectives for post-Cold War global governance in cooperation with post-Soviet states. He stated: The New York Times observed that progressives were denouncing this new world order as a rationalization of American imperial ambitions in the Middle East at the time, while conservatives rejected any new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of a UN revival. Chip Berlet, an American investigative reporter specializing in the study of right-wing movements in the U.S., wrote that the Christian and secular far right were especially terrified by Bush's speech. Fundamentalist Christian groups interpreted Bush's words as signaling the End Times, while more secular theorists approached it from an anti- communist and anti-collectivist standpoint and feared for a hegemony over all countries by the United Nations. =Post‚ÄìCold War usage= American televangelist Pat Robertson wrote the 1991 best-selling book The New World Order American televangelist Pat Robertson, with his 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, became the most prominent Christian disseminator of conspiracy theories about recent American history. He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly in the direction of world government for the Antichrist. It was observed that, throughout the 1990s, the galvanizing language used by conspiracy theorists such as Linda Thompson, Mark Koernke and Robert K. Spear led to militancy and the rise of the militia movement.Pitcavage, Mark; Institute for Intergovernmental Research: \\"Camouflage and Conspiracy. The Militia Movement From Ruby Ridge to Y2K\\". American Behavioral Scientist, Vol. 44, No. 6, pp. 957‚Äì81, SAGE Publications, 2001. The militia movement's anti-government ideology was (and is) spread through speeches at rallies and meetings, books and videotapes sold at gun shows, shortwave and satellite radio, fax networks and computer bulletin boards. It has been argued that it was overnight AM radio shows and propagandistic viral content on the internet that most effectively contributed to more extremist responses to the perceived threat of the New World Order. This led to the substantial growth of New World Order conspiracism, with it retroactively finding its way into the previously apolitical literature of numerous Kennedy assassinologists, ufologists, lost land theorists and‚Äîpartially inspired by fears surrounding the \\"Satanic panic\\"‚Äîoccultists. From the mid-1990s onward, the amorphous appeal of those subcultures transmitted New World Order conspiracism to a larger audience of seekers of stigmatized knowledge, with the common characteristic of disillusionment of political efficacy. From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, Hollywood conspiracy-thriller television shows and films also played a role in introducing a general audience to various fringe and esoteric theories related to New World Order conspiracism‚Äîwhich by that point had developed to include black helicopters, FEMA \\"concentration camps\\", etc.‚Äîtheories which for decades previously were confined to largely right-wing subcultures. The 1993‚Äì2002 television series The X-Files, the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory and the 1998 film The X-Files: Fight the Future are often cited as notable examples. Following the start of the 21st century, and specifically during the late-2000s financial crisis, many politicians and pundits, such as Gordon Brown and Henry Kissinger, used the term \\"new world order\\" in their advocacy for a comprehensive reform of the global financial system and their calls for a \\"New Bretton Woods\\" taking into account emerging markets such as China and India. These public declarations reinvigorated New World Order conspiracism, culminating in talk-show host Sean Hannity stating on his Fox News program Hannity that the \\"conspiracy theorists were right\\". Progressive media-watchdog groups have repeatedly criticized Fox News in general, and its now-defunct opinion show Glenn Beck in particular, for not only disseminating New World Order conspiracy theories to mainstream audiences, but possibly agitating so- called \\"lone wolf\\" extremism, particularly from the radical right. In 2009, American film directors Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, a critically acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy theorists‚Äîsuch as American radio host Alex Jones‚Äîwho vigorously oppose what they perceive as an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right- wing agitators and hip hop music's left-wing rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system. Conspiracy theories There are numerous systemic conspiracy theories through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed. The following is a list of the major ones in roughly chronological order: =End time= John Nelson Darby Since the 19th century, many apocalyptic millennial Christian eschatologists, starting with John Nelson Darby, have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of prophecies about the \\"end time\\" in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Ezekiel, the Book of Daniel, the Olivet discourse found in the Synoptic Gospels and the Book of Revelation. They claim that people who have made a deal with the Devil to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a utopian world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a syncretic-messianic world religion, which will later reveal itself to be a dystopian world empire that imposes the imperial cult of an ‚ÄúUnholy Trinity‚Äù of Satan, the Antichrist and the False Prophet. In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories, the False Prophet will be either the last pope of the Catholic Church (groomed and installed by an Alta Vendita or Jesuit conspiracy), a guru from the New Age movement, or even the leader of an elite fundamentalist Christian organization like the Fellowship, while the Antichrist will be either the President of the European Union, the Secretary- General of the United Nations, or even the Caliph of a pan-Islamic state. Some of the most vocal critics of end-time conspiracy theories come from within Christianity. In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the Christian Research Journal, when reviewing Robertson's 1991 book The New World Order. Another critique can be found in historian Gregory S. Camp's 1997 book Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia. Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that \\"New World Order\\" rhetoric libels the Christian faith, since the \\"New World Order\\" as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever. Furthermore, he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical, it is positively anti-biblical and fundamentally anti-Christian, because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns a comforting message about the coming kingdom of God into one of fear, panic and despair in the face of an allegedly approaching one-world government. Progressive Christians, such as preacher-theologian Peter J. Gomes, caution Christian fundamentalists that a \\"spirit of fear\\" can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism, apocalyptic timetables, demonization and oppressive prejudices, while Camp warns of the \\"very real danger that Christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage\\" by credulously embracing conspiracy theories. They therefore call on Christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent. =Freemasonry= Freemasonry is one of the world's oldest secular fraternal organizations and arose during late 16th‚Äìearly 17th century Britain. Over the years a number of allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards Freemasonry, including the allegation that Freemasons have a hidden political agenda and are conspiring to bring about a New World Order, a world government organized according to Masonic principles or governed only by Freemasons. The esoteric nature of Masonic symbolism and rites led to Freemasons first being accused of secretly practising Satanism in the late 18th century. The original allegation of a conspiracy within Freemasonry to subvert religions and governments in order to take over the world traces back to Scottish author John Robison, whose reactionary conspiracy theories crossed the Atlantic and influenced outbreaks of Protestant anti-Masonry in the United States during the 19th century. In the 1890s, French writer L√©o Taxil wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing Freemasonry and charging their lodges with worshiping Lucifer as the Supreme Being and Great Architect of the Universe. Despite the fact that Taxil admitted that his claims were all a hoax, they were and still are believed and repeated by numerous conspiracy theorists and had a huge influence on subsequent anti-Masonic claims about Freemasonry. Some conspiracy theorists eventually speculated that some Founding Fathers of the United States, such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, were having Masonic sacred geometric designs interwoven into American society, particularly in the Great Seal of the United States, the United States one-dollar bill, the architecture of National Mall landmarks and the streets and highways of Washington, D.C., as part of a master plan to create the first \\"Masonic government\\" as a model for the coming New World Order. A Masonic Lodge room Freemasons rebut these claims of a Masonic conspiracy. Freemasonry, which promotes rationalism, places no power in occult symbols themselves, and it is not a part of its principles to view the drawing of symbols, no matter how large, as an act of consolidating or controlling power. Furthermore, there is no published information establishing the Masonic membership of the men responsible for the design of the Great Seal. While conspiracy theorists assert that there are elements of Masonic influence on the Great Seal of the United States, and that these elements were intentionally or unintentionally used because the creators were familiar with the symbols, in fact, the all- seeing Eye of Providence and the unfinished pyramid were symbols used as much outside Masonic lodges as within them in the late 18th century, therefore the designers were drawing from common esoteric symbols. The Latin phrase \\"novus ordo seclorum\\", appearing on the reverse side of the Great Seal since 1782 and on the back of the one-dollar bill since 1935, translates to \\"New Order of the Ages\\", and alludes to the beginning of an era where the United States of America is an independent nation-state; it is often mistranslated by conspiracy theorists as \\"New World Order\\". Although the European continental branch of Freemasonry has organizations that allow political discussion within their Masonic Lodges, Masonic researcher Trevor W. McKeown argues that the accusations ignore several facts. Firstly, the many Grand Lodges are independent and sovereign, meaning they act on their own and do not have a common agenda. The points of belief of the various lodges often differ. Secondly, famous individual Freemasons have always held views that span the political spectrum and show no particular pattern or preference. As such, the term \\"Masonic government\\" is erroneous; there is no consensus among Freemasons about what an ideal government would look like. =Illuminati= Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati, an 18th-century Bavarian liberal and secular secret society The Order of the Illuminati was an Enlightenment-age secret society founded by university professor Adam Weishaupt on 1 May 1776, in Upper Bavaria, Germany. The movement consisted of advocates of freethought, secularism, liberalism, republicanism, and gender equality, recruited from the German Masonic Lodges, who sought to teach rationalism through mystery schools. In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up and suppressed by the government agents of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian monarchy and its state religion, Roman Catholicism. There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785. In the late 18th century, reactionary conspiracy theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression and become the masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe and the rest of the world in order to spread the most radical ideas and movements of the Enlightenment‚Äîanti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism‚Äîand to create a world noocracy and cult of reason. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent. During the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States‚Äîwhich emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism‚Äîbecame the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right- wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government. =The Protocols of the Elders of Zion= The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, originally published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world on behalf of all Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God.Soviet Jewry: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, United States Congress. House. Committee on Foreign Affairs. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 1984. p. 56 The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core. Cover of a 1920 copy of The Jewish Peril Numerous polemicists, such as Irish journalist Philip Graves in a 1921 article in The Times, and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide, have proven The Protocols to be both a hoax and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the text for Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, as a work of counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly. Responsible for feeding many antisemitic and anti-Masonic mass hysterias of the 20th century, The Protocols has been influential in the development of some conspiracy theories, including some New World Order theories, and appears repeatedly in certain contemporary conspiracy literature. For example, the authors of the 1982 controversial book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail concluded that The Protocols was the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion. They speculated that this secret society was working behind the scenes to establish a theocratic \\"United States of Europe\\". Politically and religiously unified through the imperial cult of a Merovingian Great Monarch‚Äîsupposedly descended from a Jesus bloodline‚Äîwho occupies both the throne of Europe and the Holy See, this \\"Holy European Empire\\" would become the hyperpower of the 21st century.Henry Lincoln, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Corgi, 1982. . Although the Priory of Sion itself has been exhaustively debunked by journalists and scholars as a hoax, some apocalyptic millenarian Christian eschatologists who believe The Protocols is authentic became convinced that the Priory of Sion was a fulfillment of prophecies found in the Book of Revelation and further proof of an anti-Christian conspiracy of epic proportions signaling the imminence of a New World Order. Skeptics argue that the current gambit of contemporary conspiracy theorists who use The Protocols is to claim that they \\"really\\" come from some group other than the Jews, such as fallen angels or alien invaders. Although it is hard to determine whether the conspiracy-minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text, skeptics argue that it does not make much difference, since they leave the actual, antisemitic text unchanged. The result is to give The Protocols credibility and circulation. =Round Table= During the second half of Britain's \\"imperial century\\" between 1815 and 1914, English-born South African businessman, mining magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes advocated the British Empire reannexing the United States of America and reforming itself into an \\"Imperial Federation\\" to bring about a hyperpower and lasting world peace. In his first will, written in 1877 at the age of 23, he expressed his wish to fund a secret society (known as the Society of the Elect) that would advance this goal: Magnate and colonist Cecil Rhodes advocated a secret society which would make Britain control the Earth In 1890, thirteen years after \\"his now famous will,\\" Rhodes elaborated on the same idea: establishment of \\"England everywhere,\\" which would \\"ultimately lead to the cessation of all wars, and one language throughout the world.\\" \\"The only thing feasible to carry out this idea is a secret society gradually absorbing the wealth of the world [\\"and human minds of the higher order\\"] to be devoted to such an object.\\" Rhodes also concentrated on the Rhodes Scholarship, which had British statesman Alfred Milner as one of its trustees. Established in 1902, the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among the great powers by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British, American, and German leaders by having enabled them to study for free at the University of Oxford. Milner and British official Lionel George Curtis were the architects of the Round Table movement, a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support.Curtis, Lionel. Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God London (1938). MacMillan & Sons The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis. The Council on Foreign Relations began in 1917 with a group of New York academics who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States in the interwar period. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council's projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations. In the 1960s, right-wing populist individuals and groups with a paleoconservative worldview, such as members of the John Birch Society, were the first to combine and spread a business nationalist critique of corporate internationalists networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as front organizations for the Round Table of the \\"Anglo-American Establishment\\", which are financed by an \\"international banking cabal\\" that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an oligarchic new world order through a global financial system. Anti-globalist conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S. by subordinating national sovereignty to a strengthened Bank for International Settlements. The research findings of historian Carroll Quigley, author of the 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right (W. Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view, even though Quigley argued that the Establishment is not involved in a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly. Larry McDonald, the second president of the John Birch Society and a conservative Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives who represented the 7th congressional district of Georgia, wrote a foreword for Allen's 1976 book The Rockefeller File, wherein he claimed that the Rockefellers and their allies were driven by a desire to create a one-world government that combined \\"super-capitalism\\" with communism and would be fully under their control. He saw a conspiracy plot that was \\"international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.\\"McDonald, Lawrence P. Introduction. The Rockefeller File. By Gary Allen. Seal Beach, CA: '76 Press, 1976. . In his 2002 autobiography Memoirs, David Rockefeller wrote: Barkun argues that this statement is partly facetious (the claim of \\"conspiracy\\" and \\"treason\\") and partly serious‚Äîthe desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and Japan, for example‚Äîan ideal that used to be a hallmark of the internationalist wing of the Republican Party (known as \\"Rockefeller Republicans\\" in honor of Nelson Rockefeller) when there was an internationalist wing. The statement, however, is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the brain trust of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order in the form of a one-world government. In a 13 November 2007 interview with Canadian journalist Benjamin Fulford, Rockefeller countered that he felt no need for a world government and wished for the governments of the world to work together and collaborate. He also stated that it seemed neither likely nor desirable to have only one elected government rule the whole world. He criticized accusations of him being \\"ruler of the world\\" as nonsensical. Some American social critics, such as Laurence H. Shoup, argue that the Council on Foreign Relations is an \\"imperial brain trust\\" which has, for decades, played a central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post-World War II international order and the Cold War by determining what options show up on the agenda and what options do not even make it to the table; others, such as G. William Domhoff, argue that it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum which provides the business input to U.S. foreign policy planning. Domhoff argues that \\"[i]t has nearly 3,000 members, far too many for secret plans to be kept within the group. All the council does is sponsor discussion groups, debates and speakers. As far as being secretive, it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives.\\" However, all these critics agree that \\"[h]istorical studies of the CFR show that it has a very different role in the overall power structure than what is claimed by conspiracy theorists.\\" =The Open Conspiracy= H. G. Wells wrote the books The Open Conspiracy and The New World Order In his 1928 book The Open Conspiracy British writer and futurist H. G. Wells promoted cosmopolitanism and offered blueprints for a world revolution and world brain to establish a technocratic world state and planned economy. Wells warned, however, in his 1940 book The New World Order that: Wells's books were influential in giving a second meaning to the term \\"new world order\\", which would only be used by state socialist supporters and anti-communist opponents for generations to come. However, despite the popularity and notoriety of his ideas, Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to intelligentsias who would, ultimately, have to coordinate the Wellsian new world order. =New Age= British neo-Theosophical occultist Alice Bailey, one of the founders of the so-called New Age movement, prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the Allies of World War II over the Axis powers (which occurred in 1945) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order. She saw a federal world government as the culmination of Wells' Open Conspiracy but favorably argued that it would be synarchist because it was guided by the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, intent on preparing humanity for the mystical second coming of Christ, and the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. According to Bailey, a group of ascended masters called the Great White Brotherhood works on the \\"inner planes\\" to oversee the transition to the New World Order but, for now, the members of this Spiritual Hierarchy are only known to a few occult scientists, with whom they communicate telepathically, but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases, there will be an \\"Externalization of the Hierarchy\\" and everyone will know of their presence on Earth. New Age author Alice Bailey's writings have been condemned by Christian right conspiracy theorists Bailey's writings, along with American writer Marilyn Ferguson's 1980 book The Aquarian Conspiracy, contributed to conspiracy theorists of the Christian right viewing the New Age movement as the \\"false religion\\" that would supersede Christianity in a New World Order. Skeptics argue that the term \\"New Age movement\\" is a misnomer, generally used by conspiracy theorists as a catch-all rubric for any new religious movement that is not fundamentalist Christian. By this logic, anything that is not Christian is by definition actively and willfully anti-Christian. Paradoxically, since the first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is increasingly being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge‚Äîsuch as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers Jos√© Arg√ºelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck. Skeptics argue that the connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge‚Äîwhat the Establishment spurns‚Äîmust be true. The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism. =Fourth Reich= American writer Jim Marrs claimed that former Nazis and their sympathizers have been continuing Nazi policies worldwide, especially in the United States Conspiracy theorists often use the term \\"Fourth Reich\\" simply as a pejorative synonym for the \\"New World Order\\" to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to Germany's Third Reich. Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, claim that some ex-Nazis, who survived the fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by organizations like ODESSA and Die Spinne, have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, corporatism, the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S. This neo-Nazi conspiracy is said to be animated by an \\"Iron Dream\\" in which the American Empire, having thwarted the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy and overthrown its Zionist Occupation Government, gradually establishes a Fourth Reich formerly known as the \\"Western Imperium\\"‚Äîa pan- Aryan world empire modeled after Adolf Hitler's New Order‚Äîwhich reverses the \\"decline of the West\\" and ushers a golden age of white supremacy. Skeptics argue that conspiracy theorists grossly overestimate the influence of ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad have a long history in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism. =Alien invasion= Since the late 1970s, extraterrestrials from other habitable planets or parallel dimensions (such as \\"Greys\\") and intraterrestrials from Hollow Earth (such as \\"Reptilians\\") have been included in the New World Order conspiracy, in more or less dominant roles, as in the theories put forward by American writers Stan Deyo and Milton William Cooper, and British writer David Icke. British writer David Icke claims that shapeshifting aliens called Reptilians control the Earth The common theme in these conspiracy theories is that aliens have been among us for decades, centuries or millennia, but a government cover-up enforced by \\"Men in Black\\" has shielded the public from knowledge of a secret alien invasion. Motivated by speciesism and imperialism, these aliens have been and are secretly manipulating developments and changes in human society in order to more efficiently control and exploit human beings. In some theories, alien infiltrators have shapeshifted into human form and move freely throughout human society, even to the point of taking control of command positions in governmental, corporate, and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the world. A mythical covert government agency of the United States code-named Majestic 12 is often imagined being the shadow government which collaborates with the alien occupation and permits alien abductions, in exchange for assistance in the development and testing of military \\"flying saucers\\" at Area 51, in order for United States armed forces to achieve full-spectrum dominance. Skeptics, who adhere to the psychosocial hypothesis for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory is a product of not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated. =Brave New World= One World ! Antiscience and neo-Luddite conspiracy theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their New World Order conspiracy theories. They speculate that the global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist agenda to develop and use human enhancement technologies in order to become a \\"posthuman ruling caste\\", while change accelerates toward a technological singularity‚Äîa theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them. Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a Brave New World-like dystopia‚Äîa \\"Brave New World Order\\"‚Äîor the extinction of the human species. Democratic transhumanists, such as American sociologist James Hughes, counter that many influential members of the United States Establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, as demonstrated by President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is. Postulated implementations Just as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among conspiracists about the nature of the New World Order, so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it: =Gradualism= Conspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented gradually, citing the formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones. An increasingly popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists is that the hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, will be the next milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States are in the process of being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy. Skeptics argue that the North American Union exists only as a proposal contained in one of a thousand academic and policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. Some of these papers, however, become touchstones for the conspiracy- minded and form the basis of all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety. For example, in March 2009, as a result of the late-2000s financial crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s special drawing rights. Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order. Judging that both national governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another. =Coup d'√©tat= The American militia movement claim that a coup d'√©tat will be launched by a \\"Secret Team\\" in black helicopters American right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, especially those who joined the militia movement in the United States, speculate that the New World Order will be implemented through a dramatic coup d'√©tat by a \\"secret team\\", using black helicopters, in the U.S. and other nation-states to bring about a totalitarian world government controlled by the United Nations and enforced by troops of foreign U.N. peacekeepers. Following the Rex 84 and Operation Garden Plot plans, this military coup would involve the suspension of the Constitution, the imposition of martial law, and the appointment of military commanders to head state and local governments and to detain dissidents. These conspiracy theorists, who are all strong believers in a right to keep and bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents. Before 2000, some survivalists wrongly believed this process would be set in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the 11 September attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state. Skeptics argue that unfounded fears about an imminent or eventual gun ban, military coup, internment, or U.N. invasion and occupation are rooted in the siege mentality of the American militia movement but also an apocalyptic millenarianism which provides a basic narrative within the political right in the U.S., claiming that the idealized society (i.e., constitutional republic, Jeffersonian democracy, \\"Christian nation\\", \\"white nation\\") is thwarted by subversive conspiracies of liberal secular humanists who want \\"Big Government\\" and globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order. =Mass surveillance= Conspiracy theorists concerned with surveillance abuse believe that the New World Order is being implemented by the cult of intelligence at the core of the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar- coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants. Claiming that corporations and government are planning to track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now make it possible to require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation. In January 2002, the Information Awareness Office (IAO) was established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying information technology to counter asymmetric threats to national security. Following public criticism that the development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system, the IAO was defunded by the United States Congress in 2003. The second source of controversy involved IAO's original logo, which depicted the \\"all-seeing\\" Eye of Providence atop of a pyramid looking down over the globe, accompanied by the Latin phrase scientia est potentia (knowledge is power). Although DARPA eventually removed the logo from its website, it left a lasting impression on privacy advocates. It also inflamed conspiracy theorists, who misinterpret the \\"eye and pyramid\\" as the Masonic symbol of the Illuminati, an 18th-century secret society they speculate continues to exist and is plotting on behalf of a New World Order. American historian Richard Landes, who specializes in the history of apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance and the rise of the surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist. =Occultism= Conspiracy theorists of the Christian right, starting with British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster, believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy‚Äîstarted by the first mystagogues of Gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors, such as the Kabbalists, Cathars, Knights Templar, Hermeticists, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and, ultimately, the Illuminati‚Äîwhich seeks to subvert the Judeo-Christian foundations of the Western world and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the imperial cult of the Antichrist. More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: unknown superiors, spiritual hierarchies, demons, fallen angels or Lucifer. They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences (numerology), symbols (Eye of Providence), rituals (Masonic degrees), monuments (National Mall landmarks), buildings (Manitoba Legislative Building) and facilities (Denver International Airport) to advance their plot to rule the world. For example, in June 1979, an unknown benefactor under the pseudonym \\"R. C. Christian\\" had a huge granite megalith built in the U.S. state of Georgia, which acts like a compass, calendar, and clock. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a doomsday event to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the one which was destroyed. The \\"Georgia Guidestones\\" have subsequently become a spiritual and political Rorschach test onto which any number of ideas can be imposed. Some New Agers and neo-pagans revere it as a ley-line power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order's anti-Christian \\"Ten Commandments.\\" Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended, many more meanings could arise, equally unrelated to the designer's original intention. Skeptics argue that the demonization of Western esotericism by conspiracy theorists is rooted in religious intolerance but also in the same moral panics that have fueled witch trials in the Early Modern period, and satanic ritual abuse allegations in the United States. =Population control= Conspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through the use of human population control in order to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals. The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through reproductive health and family planning programs, which promote abstinence, contraception and abortion, or intentionally reducing the bulk of the world population through genocides by mongering unnecessary wars, through plagues by engineering emergent viruses and tainting vaccines, and through environmental disasters by controlling the weather (HAARP, chemtrails), etc. Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are neo-Malthusians who engage in overpopulation and climate change alarmism in order to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government. Agenda 21 is condemned as \\"reconcentrating\\" people into urban areas and depopulating rural ones, even generating a dystopian novel by Glenn Beck where single-family homes are a distant memory. Skeptics argue that fears of population control can be traced back to the traumatic legacy of the eugenics movement's \\"war against the weak\\" in the United States during the first decades of the 20th century but also the Second Red Scare in the U.S. during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, when activists on the far right of American politics routinely opposed public health programs, notably water fluoridation, mass vaccination and mental health services, by asserting they were all part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the United Nations and its programs; the introduction of social welfare provisions, particularly the various programs established by the New Deal; and government efforts to reduce inequalities in the social structure of the U.S. Opposition towards mass vaccinations in particular got significant attention in the late 2010s, so much so the World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats of 2019. By this time, people that refused or refused to allow their children to be vaccinated were known colloquially as \\"anti-vaxxers\\", though citing the New World Order conspiracy theory or resistance to a perceived population control agenda as a reason to refuse vaccination were few and far between. =Mind control= Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and the mass media of being involved in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control‚Äîa broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control of his or her own thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, \\"Project Monarch\\") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, \\"Silent Sound Spread Spectrum\\", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses. The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists. Skeptics argue that the paranoia behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with mind control, population control, occultism, surveillance abuse, Big Business, Big Government, and globalization arises from a combination of two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong individualist values and 2) lacks power. The first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life, and one gets what some psychologists call \\"agency panic,\\" intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom. Alleged conspirators According to Domhoff, many people seem to believe that the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role. Although skeptical of New World Order conspiracism, political scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making, that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout‚Äîfueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication‚Äîrules; the nation-state's power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries. Viewing the history of the world as the history of warfare between secret societies, conspiracy theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global power elite, by claiming that established upper-class families with \\"old money\\" who founded and finance the Bilderberg Group, Bohemian Club, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Rhodes Trust, Skull and Bones, Trilateral Commission, and similar think tanks and private clubs, are illuminated conspirators plotting to impose a totalitarian New World Order‚Äîthe implementation of an authoritarian world government controlled by the United Nations and a global central bank, which maintains political power through the financialization of the economy, regulation and restriction of speech through the concentration of media ownership, mass surveillance, widespread use of state terrorism, and an all-encompassing propaganda that creates a cult of personality around a puppet world leader and ideologizes world government as the culmination of history's progress. Marxists, who are skeptical of right-wing populist conspiracy theories, also accuse the global power elite of not having the best interests of all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order‚Äîthe implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations‚Äîwhich systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one-world government. Arguing that the world is in the middle of a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail to see is that what they demonize as the \\"New World Order\\" is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend. Criticism Skeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever. Domhoff, a research professor in psychology and sociology who studies theories of power, wrote in 2005 an essay entitled There Are No Conspiracies. He says that for this theory to be true it required several \\"wealthy and highly educated people\\" to do things that don't \\"fit with what we know about power structures\\". Claims that this will happen goes back decades and have always been proved wrong. Partridge, a contributing editor to the global affairs magazine Diplomatic Courier, wrote a 2008 article entitled One World Government: Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future? He says that if anything nationalism, which is the opposite of a global government, is rising. He also says that attempts at creating global governments or global agreements \\"have been categorical failures\\" and where \\"supranational governance exist they are noted for their bureaucracy and inefficiency.\\" Although some cultural critics see superconspiracy theories about a New World Order as \\"postmodern metanarratives\\" that may be politically empowering, a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them, skeptics argue that conspiracism leads people into cynicism, convoluted thinking, and a tendency to feel it is hopeless even as they denounce the alleged conspirators. Alexander Zaitchik from the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote a report titled \\"'Patriot' Paranoia: A Look at the Top Ten Conspiracy Theories\\", in which he personally condemns such conspiracies as an effort of the radical right to undermine society. Concerned that the improvisational millennialism of most conspiracy theories about a New World Order might motivate lone wolves to engage in leaderless resistance leading to domestic terrorist incidents like the Oklahoma City bombing, Barkun writes that \\"the danger lies less in such beliefs themselves ... than in the behavior they might stimulate or justify\\" and warns \\"should they believe that the prophesied evil day had in fact arrived, their behavior would become far more difficult to predict.\\" Warning of the threat to American democracy posed by right-wing populist movements led by demagogues who mobilize support for mob rule or even a fascist revolution by exploiting the fear of conspiracies, Berlet writes that \\"Right-wing populist movements can cause serious damage to a society because they often popularize xenophobia, authoritarianism, scapegoating, and conspiracism. This can lure mainstream politicians to adopt these themes to attract voters, legitimize acts of discrimination (or even violence), and open the door for revolutionary right-wing populist movements, such as fascism, to recruit from the reformist populist movements.\\" Hughes, a professor of religion, warns that no religious idea has greater potential for shaping global politics in profoundly negative ways than \\"the new world order\\". He writes in a February 2011 article entitled Revelation, Revolutions, and the Tyrannical New World Order that \\"the crucial piece of this puzzle is the identity of the Antichrist, the tyrannical figure who both leads and inspires the new world order\\". This has in turn been the Soviet Union and the Arab world. He says that inspires believers to \\"welcome war with the Islamic world\\" and opens the door to nuclear holocaust.\\" Criticisms of New World Order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community. Despite believing themselves to be \\"freedom fighters\\", many right-wing populist conspiracy theorists hold views that are incompatible with their professed libertarianism, such as dominionism, white supremacism, and even eliminationism. This paradox has led Icke, who argues that Christian Patriots are the only Americans who understand the truth about the New World Order (which he believes is controlled by a race of reptilians known as the \\"Babylonian Brotherhood\\"), to reportedly tell a Christian Patriot group, \\"I don't know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with.\\" See also * Anti-globalization movement * Criticisms of globalization * Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory References Further reading The following is a list of non-self-published non-fiction books that discuss New World Order conspiracy theories.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The short was released on March 8, 1958, and stars Daffy Duck as Robin Hood and Porky Pig as Friar Tuck. It was the last of Jones' parody cartoons with the duo, and the last appearance of Porky in a theatrical cartoon directed by Jones during the Golden Age of Animation. It was also the second parody of Robin Hood directed by Chuck Jones, after the 1949 Bugs Bunny short Rabbit Hood. An edited version of Robin Hood Daffy was included in the theatrical film The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie (1979).  Plot  The film features Daffy Duck in the role of legendary outlaw Robin Hood, and opens to the strains of his playing a song on a long- necked lute similar to a tambouras. As he prances along singing, he trips and tumbles down a hill (still singing), off a bank and into a river. Watching is Porky Pig, as a Friar Tuck figure, who laughs uproariously at Daffy's inglorious plunge. The annoyed Daffy tries to prove his skill with a quarterstaff (\\"Actually, it's a buck-and-a-quarter quarterstaff, but I'm not telling him that!\\") on a tree-trunk bridge, but manages to hit himself in the face with it, bending his bill in what becomes a recurring visual gag throughout the film. Undeterred, Daffy tries again, but while he is spinning his quarterstaff, Porky stops it with a wooden dowel, resulting in Daffy himself spinning around and falling back into the river. He gets out of the water and confronts Porky, who has once again been reduced to fits of laughter. Daffy is initially annoyed, but then starts to laugh along with him before becoming annoyed again. Having given up showing off, Daffy attempts to leave, but Porky follows and asks the \\"traveling clown\\" if he knows the whereabouts of Robin Hood's hideout as he \\"wouldst fain join me up with his band of jolly outlaws\\". Daffy proudly announces that he is Robin Hood, but Porky disbelieves him. In order to prove that he is Robin Hood, Daffy informs Porky that he will attempt to rob a rich traveler on a bouncing mule and give his money \\"to some poor unworthy slob\\". Watched by Porky, Daffy pitifully fails in each and every attempt he makes to stop the traveler, usually injuring himself in the process. Daffy first attempts to shoot the traveler with an arrow, but ends up firing himself from his own bow and crashing into a tree and ends up with his head stuck through the trunk. Moments later, Daffy, (still with his head through the trunk of the now uprooted tree), confronts Porky who sarcastically says \\"Oh I er don't how I could have doubted you. Shall we spend the gold all in one place?\\" Daffy retorts \\"Ho ho. Very funny. Ha ha it is to laugh\\". Daffy then attempts to swing on a rope and kidnap the rich traveler, but slams into a succession of trees (repeatedly crying \\"Yoicks! And awa-aaay!\\" with each launch) and after chopping the trees down to clear a path, his final attempt results in him slamming face-first into a boulder. Daffy again tries to swing down from a rope, which is this time attached to a huge iron ball. He ends up slamming face-first into the side of a cliff, causing the iron ball to drop down on top of him. Daffy then attempts to fire a spear from a rubber band stretched between two trees, but it ends up forming a bridge so that the rich traveler can cross a ravine. Eventually, the rich traveler, completely oblivious to Daffy's increasingly desperate attempts to rob him, reaches his castle unharmed, despite Daffy's final attempt to rob him by standing in front of the entrance (And getting crushed by the drawbridge as a result). This convinces Porky that Daffy is \\"just not Robin Hood\\". The frustrated Daffy finally gives up, and in the final scene walks on with a tonsured head and wearing a habit, having decided to become a friar himself, he tells Porky; \\"Never mind joining me, I'll join you. Shake hands with Friar Duck!\\" As the film closes, Daffy's bill bends back up one more time. Home video Robin Hood Daffy, along with Rabbit Hood, is available as an extra on the DVD (and later the Blu-ray) edition of The Adventures of Robin Hood. The short is also available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 and Essential Daffy Duck DVD sets, as well as the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1 Blu-ray set.

It is about 7500 km2 (2900 sq miles) in the area and is reputed to be one of the largest salt deserts in the world. This area has been inhabited by the Kutchi people. The Hindi word is derived from Sanskrit/Vedic word ' (‡§á‡§∞‡§ø‡§£) attested in the Rigveda and Mahabharata. It is an extension of the Thar Desert. Location and description The Great Rann of Kutch, along with the Little Rann of Kutch and the Banni grasslands on its southern edge, is situated in the district of Kutch and comprises some between the Gulf of Kutch and the mouth of the Indus River in southern Pakistan. The marsh can be accessed from the village of Kharaghoda in Surendranagar District. The Great Rann of Kutch together with the Little Rann of Kutch is called Rann of Kutch. In India's summer monsoon, the flat desert of salty clay and mudflats, which average 15 meters above sea level, fills with standing water. In very wet years, the wetland extends from the Gulf of Kutch on the west through to the Gulf of Cambay on the east.At its greatest extent, the Gulf of Kutch on the west (visible in the image directly below the salt marshes) and the Gulf of Cambay on the east (the brown, sediment-tinged body of water on the lower right) are both united during the monsoon. The area was a vast shallow of the Arabian Sea until continuing geological uplift closed off the connection with the sea, creating a vast lake that was still navigable during the time of Alexander the Great. The Ghaggar River, which presently empties into the desert of northern Rajasthan, formerly emptied into the Rann of Kutch, but the lower reaches of the river dried up as its upstream tributaries were captured by the Indus and Ganges thousands of years ago. Traces of the delta and its distributary channels on the northern boundary of the Rann of Kutch were documented by the Geological Survey of India in 2000. The Luni River, which originates in Rajasthan, drains into the desert in the northeast corner of the Rann. Other rivers feeding into the marsh include the Rupen from the east and the West Banas River from the northeast. Nara Canal or Puran river which is a delta channel of Indus River empties during floods into Kori Creek located in the Great Rann of Kutch. There are sandy islets of thorny scrub, forming a wildlife sanctuary and a breeding ground for some of the largest flocks of greater and lesser flamingos. Wildlife, including the Indian wild ass, shelter on islands of higher ground, called bets, during the flooding. Climate This is one of the hottest areas of India ‚Äì with summer temperatures averaging and peaking at 49.5 ¬∞C. Winter temperatures reduce dramatically and can go below . Religions Many religions are found here, including Hinduism, Islam, Jainism & Sikhism. Threats and preservation Although most of the marsh is in protected areas, the habitats are vulnerable to cattle grazing, firewood collection, and salt extraction operations, all of which may involve transportation that disturbs wildlife. There are several wildlife sanctuaries and protected reserves on the Indian side in the Rann of Kutch region. From the city of Bhuj, various ecologically rich and wildlife conservation areas of the Kutch/Kachchh district can be visited such as Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary, Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary, Banni Grasslands Reserve and Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve. Indo-Pakistan international border Creeks in Great Rann of Kutch area In India the northern boundary of the Greater Rann of Kutch forms the International Border between India and Pakistan, it is heavily patrolled by India's Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indian Army conducts exercises here to acclimatize its troops to this harsh terrain. This inhospitable salty lowland, rich in natural gas, was one scene of perennial border disputes between India and Pakistan that, in April 1965, contributed to the Indo- Pakistani War of 1965. Later the same year, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Wilson persuaded the combatants to end hostilities and establish a tribunal to resolve the dispute. A verdict was reached in 1968 which saw Pakistan getting 10% of its claim of . 90% was awarded to India, although India claimed 100% of the region. Tensions spurted again in 1999 during the Atlantique incident. Elements of dispute remain in Sir Creek, since 1969, there have been twelve rounds of talks between the two nations, without a breakthrough. The twelfth round was completed in June 2012. Indus River floods The Indus river had been flowing into Rann of Kutch area and Rann of Kutch used to be its catchment area forming part of its delta. Indus river delta branch/channel called Koree river shifted its course after an earthquake in 1819 isolating Rann of Kutch from its delta. Pakistan has constructed the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) project to bypass the saline and polluted water which is not fit for agriculture use to reach the sea via Rann of Kutch area without passing through the Indus delta. The 500 km long LBOD, begins from northern Ghotki district in Sindh province of Pakistan and joins Rann of Kutch in the Badin district of Sindh. Rann of Kutch is the joint water body of India and Pakistan. Water released by the LBOD is enhancing the flooding in India and contaminating the quality of water bodies which are the source of water to salt farms spread over a vast area. The LBOD water is planned to join the sea via disputed Sir Creek but LBOD water is entering Indian territory due to many breaches in its left bank caused by floods Chir Batti At night, an unexplained strange dancing light phenomenon known locally as Chir Batti (ghost lights) occurs in the Rann, the adjoining Banni grasslands, and the seasonal wetlands. Tourism City of tents during Rann Utsav. Sunset at Rann of Kutch The Government of Gujarat hosts an annual 3-month long \\"Rann Utsav\\" festival from December to February every year near Dhordo village in this 500 sqkm pristine white salt desert landscapes during winter where tourists can see the various sights of the Rann. Rann Utsav can be visited by anyone but Tent City with 400 tents allows entry only to those who are staying there. Rann Utsav has cultural programs such as the BSF Camel show held at 5 pm, adventure activities like hot-air ballooning, many stalls selling trinkets, handicrafts, food, etc. as well as camel cart excursion, paramotoring, golf carts, ATV rides, yoga and meditation. During the festival 3 to 4-day events are also held at many other exotic locations around the larger Kutch area to expose tourists to the native culture and food, for example, semi-arid grasslands of the Banni reserve exhibits folk architecture, arts and crafts of the area, and folk dance and dance music events are held at several locations with a bonfire under the moon.All the excitement of Gujarat'ss Rann Utsav, Femina, 29 November 2019. Rann Utsav gives visitors not only a chance to experience a full moon on salt deserts but also get a taste of the local culture, cuisine, and hospitality. Specially built local houses are also used to house tourists to give them a taste of local traditions Many adventure clubs and travel clubs organize expeditions.Rann Utsav Official Website Handicrafts Some women and young girls make their living by selling different types of Kutch embroidered cloths. The embroidery is of various styles such as Rabari, Ahir, Sindhi, Banni, Mutwa, Ari and Soof, some of which include mirror or bead inlays. Popular culture J. P. Dutta's Bollywood film Refugee was shot in the Great Rann of Kutch along with other locations in the Kachchh district. It is said to have been inspired by the story by Keki N. Daruwalla based around the Great Rann of Kutch titled Love Across the Salt Desert. Amitabh Bachchan in his promotions for Gujarat Tourism titled Khushboo Gujarat Ki has also extensively shot in the Rann of kutch. Several scenes in Salman Rushdie's Booker Prize winning novel Midnight's Children take place in the Rann of Kutch, including a scene where the protagonist faints from heatstroke in the Rann's brutal climate. Some scenes or song sequences in Indian films like Magadheera, D-Day, R... Rajkumar, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, Lagaan, The Good Road, Dookudu, Sarvam, and Sarrainodu were shot in the area.

A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers. Type enforcement can be static, catching potential errors at compile time, or dynamic, associating type information with values at run-time and consulting them as needed to detect imminent errors, or a combination of both. The behaviors classified as type errors by a given programming language are usually those that result from attempts to perform operations on values that are not of the appropriate data type. This classification is partly based on opinion; it may imply that any operation not leading to program crashes, security flaws or other obvious failures is legitimate and need not be considered an error, or it may imply that any contravention of the programmer's explicit intent (as communicated via typing annotations) to be erroneous and not \\"type-safe\\". In the context of static (compile-time) type systems, type safety usually involves (among other things) a guarantee that the eventual value of any expression will be a legitimate member of that expression's static type. The precise requirement is more subtle than this ‚Äî see, for example, subtype and polymorphism for complications. Type safety is closely linked to memory safety, a restriction on the ability to copy arbitrary bit patterns from one memory location to another. For instance, in an implementation of a language that has some type t, such that some sequence of bits (of the appropriate length) does not represent a legitimate member of t, if that language allows data to be copied into a variable of type t, then it is not type-safe because such an operation might assign a non-t value to that variable. Conversely, if the language is type-unsafe to the extent of allowing an arbitrary integer to be used as a pointer, then it is not memory- safe. Most statically typed languages provide a degree of type safety that is strictly stronger than memory safety, because their type systems enforce the proper use of abstract data types defined by programmers even when this is not strictly necessary for memory safety or for the prevention of any kind of catastrophic failure. Definitions Type-safe code accesses only the memory locations it is authorized to access. (For this discussion, type safety specifically refers to memory type safety and should not be confused with type safety in a broader respect.) For example, type-safe code cannot read values from another object's private fields. Robin Milner provided the following slogan to describe type safety: :Well-typed programs cannot \\"go wrong\\". The appropriate formalization of this slogan depends on the style of formal semantics used for a particular language. In the context of denotational semantics, type safety means that the value of an expression that is well- typed, say with type œÑ, is a bona fide member of the set corresponding to œÑ. In 1994, Andrew Wright and Matthias Felleisen formulated what is now the standard definition and proof technique for type safety in languages defined by operational semantics. Under this approach, type safety is determined by two properties of the semantics of the programming language: ;(Type-) preservation or subject reduction: \\"Well typedness\\" (\\"typability\\") of programs remains invariant under the transition rules (i.e. evaluation rules or reduction rules) of the language. ;Progress: A well typed (typable) program never gets \\"stuck\\", which means the expressions in the program will either be evaluated to a value, or there is a transition rule for it; in other words, the program never gets into an undefined state where no further transitions are possible. These properties do not exist in a vacuum; they are linked to the semantics of the programming language they describe, and there is a large space of varied languages that can fit these criteria, since the notion of \\"well typed\\" program is part of the static semantics of the programming language and the notion of \\"getting stuck\\" (or \\"going wrong\\") is a property of its dynamic semantics. Vijay Saraswat provides the following definition: :\\"A language is type-safe if the only operations that can be performed on data in the language are those sanctioned by the type of the data.\\" Relation to other forms of safety Type safety is ultimately aimed at excluding other problems, e.g.:- * Prevention of illegal operations. For example, we can identify an expression \`3 / \\"Hello, World\\"\` as invalid, because the rules of arithmetic do not specify how to divide an integer by a string. * Memory safety ** Wild pointers can arise when a pointer to one type object is treated as a pointer to another type. For instance, the size of an object depends on the type, so if a pointer is incremented under the wrong credentials, it will end up pointing at some random area of memory. ** Buffer overflow - Out-of bound writes can corrupt the contents of objects already present on the heap. This can occur when a larger object of one type is crudely copied into smaller object of another type. * Logic errors originating in the semantics of different types. For instance, inches and millimeters may both be stored as integers, but should not be substituted for each other or added. A type system can enforce two different types of integer for them. Type-safe and type- unsafe languages Type safety is usually a requirement for any toy language proposed in academic programming language research. Many languages, on the other hand, are too big for human-generated type safety proofs, as they often require checking thousands of cases. Nevertheless, some languages such as Standard ML, which has rigorously defined semantics, have been proved to meet one definition of type safety.Standard ML. Smlnj.org. Retrieved on 2013-11-02. Some other languages such as Haskell are believed to meet some definition of type safety, provided certain \\"escape\\" features are not used (for example Haskell's \`unsafePerformIO\`, used to \\"escape\\" from the usual restricted environment in which I/O is possible, circumvents the type system and so can be used to break type safety.) Type punning is another example of such an \\"escape\\" feature. Regardless of the properties of the language definition, certain errors may occur at run-time due to bugs in the implementation, or in linked libraries written in other languages; such errors could render a given implementation type unsafe in certain circumstances. An early version of Sun's Java virtual machine was vulnerable to this sort of problem.  Strong and weak typing  Programming languages are often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (also loosely typed) to refer to certain aspects of type safety. In 1974, Liskov and Zilles defined a strongly-typed language as one in which \\"whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.\\" In 1977, Jackson wrote, \\"In a strongly typed language each data area will have a distinct type and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.\\" In contrast, a weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion. Type safety in object oriented languages In object oriented languages type safety is usually intrinsic in the fact that a type system is in place. This is expressed in terms of class definitions. A class essentially defines the structure of the objects derived from it and an API as a contract for handling these objects. Each time a new object is created it will comply with that contract. Each function that exchanges objects derived from a specific class, or implementing a specific interface, will adhere to that contract: hence in that function the operations permitted on that object will be only those defined by the methods of the class the object implements. This will guarantee that the object integrity will be preserved.Type safety is hence also a matter of good class definition: public methods that modify the internal state of an object shall preserve the object itegrity Exceptions to this are object oriented languages that allow dynamic modification of the object structure, or the use of reflection to modify the content of an object to overcome the constraints imposed by the class methods definitions. Type safety issues in specific languages = Ada = Ada was designed to be suitable for embedded systems, device drivers and other forms of system programming, but also to encourage type-safe programming. To resolve these conflicting goals, Ada confines type-unsafety to a certain set of special constructs whose names usually begin with the string \`Unchecked_\`. Unchecked_Deallocation can be effectively banned from a unit of Ada text by applying \`pragma Pure\` to this unit. It is expected that programmers will use \`Unchecked_\` constructs very carefully and only when necessary; programs that do not use them are type-safe. The SPARK programming language is a subset of Ada eliminating all its potential ambiguities and insecurities while at the same time adding statically checked contracts to the language features available. SPARK avoids the issues with dangling pointers by disallowing allocation at run time entirely. Ada2012 adds statically checked contracts to the language itself (in form of pre-, and post-conditions, as well as type invariants). = C = The C programming language is type-safe in limited contexts; for example, a compile-time error is generated when an attempt is made to convert a pointer to one type of structure to a pointer to another type of structure, unless an explicit cast is used. However, a number of very common operations are non-type-safe; for example, the usual way to print an integer is something like \`printf(\\"%d\\", 12)\`, where the \`%d\` tells \`printf\` at run-time to expect an integer argument. (Something like \`printf(\\"%s\\", 12)\`, which tells the function to expect a pointer to a character-string and yet supplies an integer argument, may be accepted by compilers, but will produce undefined results.) This is partially mitigated by some compilers (such as gcc) checking type correspondences between printf arguments and format strings. In addition, C, like Ada, provides unspecified or undefined explicit conversions; and unlike in Ada, idioms that use these conversions are very common, and have helped to give C a type-unsafe reputation. For example, the standard way to allocate memory on the heap is to invoke a memory allocation function, such as \`malloc\`, with an argument indicating how many bytes are required. The function returns an untyped pointer (type \`void *\`), which the calling code must explicitly or implicitly cast to the appropriate pointer type. Pre-standardized implementations of C required an explicit cast to do so, therefore the code \`(struct foo *) malloc(sizeof(struct foo))\` became the accepted practice. =C++= Some features of C++ that promote more type-safe code: * The new operator returns a pointer of type based on operand, whereas malloc returns a void pointer. * C++ code can use virtual functions and templates to achieve polymorphism without void pointers. * Safer casting operators, such as dynamic cast that performs run-time type checking. * C++11 strongly-typed enumerations cannot be implicitly converted to or from integers or other enumeration types. * C++ explicit constructors and C++11 explicit conversion operators prevent implicit type conversions. =C#= C# is type- safe (but not statically type-safe). It has support for untyped pointers, but this must be accessed using the \\"unsafe\\" keyword which can be prohibited at the compiler level. It has inherent support for run-time cast validation. Casts can be validated by using the \\"as\\" keyword that will return a null reference if the cast is invalid, or by using a C-style cast that will throw an exception if the cast is invalid. See C Sharp conversion operators. Undue reliance on the object type (from which all other types are derived) runs the risk of defeating the purpose of the C# type system. It is usually better practice to abandon object references in favour of generics, similar to templates in C++ and generics in Java. =Java= The Java language is designed to enforce type safety. Anything in Java happens inside an object and each object is an instance of a class. To implement the type safety enforcement, each object, before usage, needs to be allocated. Java allows usage of primitive types but only inside properly allocated objects. Sometimes a part of the type safety is implemented indirectly: e.g. the class BigDecimal represents a floating point number of arbitrary precision, but handles only numbers that can be expressed with a finite representation. The operation BigDecimal.divide() calculates a new object as the division of two numbers expressed as BigDecimal. In this case if the division has no finite representation, as when one computes e.g. 1/3=0.33333..., the divide() method can raise an exception if no rounding mode is defined for the operation. Hence the library, rather than the language, guarantees that the object respects the contract implicit in the class definition. =Standard ML= SML has rigorously defined semantics and is known to be type-safe. However, some implementations of SML, including Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ), its syntactic variant Mythryl and Mlton, provide libraries that offer certain unsafe operations. These facilities are often used in conjunction with those implementations' foreign function interfaces to interact with non-ML code (such as C libraries) that may require data laid out in specific ways. Another example is the SML/NJ interactive toplevel itself, which must use unsafe operations to execute ML code entered by the user. = Modula-2 = Modula-2 is a strongly-typed language with a design philosophy to require any unsafe facilities to be explicitly marked as unsafe. This is achieved by \\"moving\\" such facilities into a built-in pseudo-library called SYSTEM from where they must be imported before they can be used. The import thus makes it visible when such facilities are used. Unfortunately, this was not consequently implemented in the original language report and its implementation. There still remained unsafe facilities such as the type cast syntax and variant records (inherited from Pascal) that could be used without prior import. The difficulty in moving these facilities into the SYSTEM pseudo-module was the lack of any identifier for the facility that could then be imported since only identifiers can be imported, but not syntax. IMPORT SYSTEM; (* allows the use of certain unsafe facilities: *) VAR word : SYSTEM.WORD; addr : SYSTEM.ADDRESS; addr := SYSTEM.ADR(word); (* but type cast syntax can be used without such import *) VAR i : INTEGER; n : CARDINAL; n := CARDINAL(i); (* or *) i := INTEGER(n); The ISO Modula-2 standard corrected this for the type cast facility by changing the type cast syntax into a function called CAST which has to be imported from pseudo-module SYSTEM. However, other unsafe facilities such as variant records remained available without any import from pseudo-module SYSTEM. IMPORT SYSTEM; VAR i : INTEGER; n : CARDINAL; i := SYSTEM.CAST(INTEGER, n); (* Type cast in ISO Modula-2 *) A recent revision of the language applied the original design philosophy rigorously. First, pseudo- module SYSTEM was renamed to UNSAFE to make the unsafe nature of facilities imported from there more explicit. Then all remaining unsafe facilities where either removed altogether (for example variant records) or moved to pseudo- module UNSAFE. For facilities where there is no identifier that could be imported, enabling identifiers were introduced. In order to enable such a facility, its corresponding enabling identifier must be imported from pseudo- module UNSAFE. No unsafe facilities remain in the language that do not require import from UNSAFE. IMPORT UNSAFE; VAR i : INTEGER; n : CARDINAL; i := UNSAFE.CAST(INTEGER, n); (* Type cast in Modula-2 Revision 2010 *) FROM UNSAFE IMPORT FFI; (* enabling identifier for foreign function interface facility *) <*FFI=\\"C\\"*> (* pragma for foreign function interface to C *) =Pascal= Pascal has had a number of type safety requirements, some of which are kept in some compilers. Where a Pascal compiler dictates \\"strict typing\\", two variables cannot be assigned to each other unless they are either compatible (such as conversion of integer to real) or assigned to the identical subtype. For example, if you have the following code fragment: type TwoTypes = record I: Integer; Q: Real; end; DualTypes = record I: Integer; Q: Real; end; var T1, T2: TwoTypes; D1, D2: DualTypes; Under strict typing, a variable defined as \`TwoTypes\` is not compatible with \`DualTypes\` (because they are not identical, even though the components of that user defined type are identical) and an assignment of \` T1 := D2; \` is illegal. An assignment of \`T1 := T2; \` would be legal because the subtypes they are defined to are identical. However, an assignment such as \`T1.Q := D1.Q;\` would be legal. =Common Lisp= In general, Common Lisp is a type-safe language. A Common Lisp compiler is responsible for inserting dynamic checks for operations whose type safety cannot be proven statically. However, a programmer may indicate that a program should be compiled with a lower level of dynamic type-checking. A program compiled in such a mode cannot be considered type-safe.  C++ examples  The following examples illustrates how C++ cast operators can break type safety when used incorrectly. The first example shows how basic data types can be incorrectly casted: #include using namespace std; int main () { int ival = 5; // integer value float fval = reinterpret_cast(ival); // reinterpret bit pattern cout << fval << endl; // output integer as float return 0; } In this example, \`reinterpret_cast\` explicitly prevents the compiler from performing a safe conversion from integer to floating-point value.http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast When the program runs it will output a garbage floating-point value. The problem could have been avoided by instead writing \`float fval = ival;\` The next example shows how object references can be incorrectly downcasted: #include using namespace std; class Parent { public: virtual ~Parent() {} // virtual destructor for RTTI }; class Child1 : public Parent { public: int a; }; class Child2 : public Parent { public: float b; }; int main () { Child1 c1; c1.a = 5; Parent & p = c1; // upcast always safe Child2 & c2 = static_cast(p); // invalid downcast cout << c2.b << endl; // will output garbage data return 0; } The two child classes have members of different types. When downcasting a parent class pointer to a child class pointer, then the resulting pointer may not point to a valid object of correct type. In the example, this leads to garbage value being printed. The problem could have been avoided by replacing \`static_cast\` with \`dynamic_cast\` that throws an exception on invalid casts.http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/dynamic_cast See also *Type theory Notes References  Programming language topics Type theory Articles with example Pascal code ","title":"Type safety"},{"id":"602652","text":"GameSurge is a popular Internet Relay Chat network devoted to the online multiplayer gaming community.

Biography Hartmann was born in Berlin, the son of Prussian Major General Robert von Hartmann and was educated with the intention of him pursuing a military career. In 1858 he entered the Guards Artillery Regiment of the Prussian Army and attended the United Artillery and Engineering School. He achieved the rank of first lieutenant but took leave from the army in 1865 due to a chronic knee problem. After some hesitation between pursuing music or philosophy, he decided to make the latter his profession, and in 1867 obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Rostock. In 1868 he formally resigned from the army. After the great success of his first work Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869)‚Äîthe publication of which led to Hartmann being embroiled in the pessimism controversy in Germany‚Äîhe rejected professorships offered to him by the universities of Leipzig, G√∂ttingen and Berlin. He subsequently returned to Berlin. For many years, he lived a retired life of study as an independent scholar, doing most of his work in bed, while suffering great pain. Hartmann married Agnes Taubert (1844‚Äì1877) on 3 July 1872 in Charlottenburg. After her death, he married Alma Lorenz (1854‚Äì1931) on 4 November 1878 in Bremen. The marriages produced six children. He died at Gross-Lichterfelde in 1906 and is buried in an honorary grave in the Columbiadamm Cemetery in Berlin. Philosophical work His reputation as a philosopher was established by his first book, Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869; 10th ed. 1890). This success was largely due to the originality of its title, the diversity of its contents (von Hartmann professing to obtain his speculative results by the methods of inductive science, and making plentiful use of concrete illustrations), its fashionable pessimism and the vigour and lucidity of its style. The conception of the Unconscious, by which von Hartmann describes his ultimate metaphysical principle is, fundamentally, not as paradoxical as it sounds, being merely a new and mysterious designation for the Absolute of German metaphysicians. The Unconscious is both Will and Reason (the latter concept also interpreted as Idea) and the absolute all-embracing ground of all existence. Von Hartmann thus combines pantheism with panlogism in a manner adumbrated by Schelling in his positive philosophy. Nevertheless, Will and not Reason is the primary aspect of the Unconscious, whose melancholy career is determined by the primacy of the Will and the latency of the Reason. Will is void of reason when it passes from potentiality to actual willing. The original state of the Unconscious is one of potentiality, in which, by pure chance, the Will begins to strive. In the transition state, called that of the empty Will, there is no definite end. Acting on its own, the Will creates absolute misery. To avoid the unhappiness of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially present and the Unconscious becomes actual. The existence of the universe is the result, then, of the illogical Will, but its characteristics and laws are all due to the Idea or Reason and are, therefore, logical. It is the best of all possible worlds, which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist. The history of the world is that given by natural science, and particular emphasis is laid upon the Darwinian theory of evolution. Humanity developed from the animal, and with the appearance of the first human being the deliverance of the world is in sight, for only in the human being does consciousness reach such height and complexity as to act independently of the Will. As consciousness develops, there is a constantly growing recognition of the fact that deliverance must lie in a return to the original state of non- willing, which means the non-existence of all individuals and the potentiality of the Unconscious. When the greater part of the Will in existence is so far enlightened by reason as to perceive the inevitable misery of existence, a collective effort to will non-existence will be made, and the world will relapse into nothingness, the Unconscious into quiescence. Von Hartmann called his philosophy a transcendental realism, because in it he professed to reach by means of induction from the broadest possible basis of experience a knowledge of that which lies beyond experience. A certain portion of consciousness, namely perception, begins, changes and ends without our consent and often in direct opposition to our desires. Perception, then, cannot be adequately explained from the ego alone, and the existence of things outside experience must be posited. Moreover, since they act upon consciousness and do so in different ways at different times, they must have those qualities assigned to them which would make such action possible. Causality is thus made the link that connects the subjective world of ideas with the objective world of things. An examination of the rest of experience, especially such phenomena as instinct, voluntary motion, sexual love, artistic production and the like, makes it evident that Will and Idea, unconscious but teleological, are everywhere operative, and that the underlying force is one and not many. This thing-in-itself may be called the Unconscious. It has two equally original attributes, namely, Will and Idea (or Reason). The Unconscious appears as a combination of the metaphysics of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel with that of Arthur Schopenhauer. In von Hartmann's view, Hegel and Schopenhauer were both wrong in making Idea or Reason subordinate to Will or Will subordinate to Idea or Reason; on the contrary, neither can act alone, and neither is the result of the other. The Will's lack of logic causes the existence of the \\"that\\" () of the world; the Idea or Reason, though not conscious, is logical, and determines the essence, the \\"what\\" (). The endless and vain striving of the Will necessitates the great preponderance of suffering in the universe, which could not well be more wretched than it is. Nevertheless, it must be characterized as the best possible world, for both nature and history are constantly developing in the manner best adapted to the ending of the world; and by means of increasing consciousness the idea, instead of prolonging suffering to eternity, provides a refuge from the evils of existence in non- existence. Von Hartmann is a pessimist, for no other view of life recognizes that evil necessarily belongs to existence and can cease only with existence itself. But he is not an unmitigated pessimist. The individual's happiness is indeed unattainable either here and now or hereafter and in the future, but he does not despair of ultimately releasing the Unconscious from its sufferings. He differs from Schopenhauer in making salvation collective by the negation of the will to live depend on a collective social effort and not on individualistic asceticism. The conception of a redemption of the Unconscious also supplies the ultimate basis of von Hartmann's ethics. We must provisionally affirm life and devote ourselves to social evolution, instead of striving after a happiness which is impossible; in so doing we shall find that morality renders life less unhappy than it would otherwise be. Suicide, and all other forms of selfishness, are highly reprehensible. His realism enables him to maintain the reality of Time, and so of the process of the world's redemption. The essential feature of the morality built upon the basis of Hartmann's philosophy is the realization that all is one and that, while every attempt to gain happiness is illusory, yet before deliverance is possible, all forms of the illusion must appear and be tried to the utmost. Even he who recognizes the vanity of life best serves the highest aims by giving himself up to the illusion, and living as eagerly as if he thought life good. It is only through the constant attempt to gain happiness that people can learn the desirability of nothingness; and when this knowledge has become universal, or at least general, deliverance will come and the world will cease. No better proof of the rational nature of the universe is needed than that afforded by the different ways in which men have hoped to find happiness and so have been led unconsciously to work for the final goal. The first of these is the hope of good in the present, the confidence in the pleasures of this world, such as was felt by the Greeks. This is followed by the Christian transference of happiness to another and better life, to which in turn succeeds the illusion that looks for happiness in progress, and dreams of a future made worth while by the achievements of science. All alike are empty promises, and known as such in the final stage, which sees all human desires as equally vain and the only good in the peace of Nirvana. The relation between philosophy and religion lies in their common recognition of an underlying unity, which transcends all the apparent differences and divisions due to individual phenomena. Many changes must take place in the existing religions before they will be suited to modern conditions, and the resulting religion of the future will be a concrete monism. Von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious has been the subject of many different estimates, but is regarded as having less intrinsic than historical value. Its influence upon other thinkers was especially marked during the years following its first appearance, but by the early 20th century that influence had much decreased. However, there are some grounds for considering it as providing the connection of thought between Schopenhauer's philosophy of the 'Will' and Sigmund Freud's psychology of the 'unconscious'. In a sense his thought creates the bridge between the post- Kantian views of Will (in particular Schopenhauer's) and the Z√ºrich school of psychology.'Philosopher of the Unconscious' by Edouard d'Araille (Introduction to Vol. 1 of The Philosophy of the Unconscious [2006 Ed./LTMI]) Reception Rudolf Steiner, referring to Hartmann's Critical Establishment of Transcendental Realism (Kritische Grundlegung des transzendentalen Realismus, 2nd Edition Berlin, 1875) gave his opinion, in the preface to his own book Truth and Knowledge (1892), that Hartmann's world-view was \\"the most significant philosophical work of our time\\".Rudolf Steiner, Truth and Knowledge, Introduction to The Philosophy of Freedom, 1892 Carl Jung wrote in his autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1963), that he had read von Hartmann \\"assiduously\\". Philipp Mainl√§nder dedicated an essay to the philosophy of Von Hartmann. He did not consider him to be a genuine philosopher, because he did not start his philosophy with an epistemological research, despite the warnings of Kant and Schopenhauer. The criticism has been described as an attack abounding in clean hits but marred by bitter sarcasm, such as \\"is the coitus a sacrifice the individual makes? You must be ‚Äì I repeat it ‚Äì a very strangely organized being\\", and for denying Schopenhauer's deduction that the will is thing in itself: \\"you also have the sad honor, to stand at the same level as those who have misunderstood Copernicus and still confidently believe that the sun turns around the earth.\\" Friedrich Nietzsche offers a scathing criticism of von Hartmann, calling his philosophy \\"unconscious irony\\" and \\"roguery\\", in the second of his Untimely Meditations, On the Use and Abuse of History for Life.Wikisource:On the Use and Abuse of History for Life British film-maker and author Edouard d'Araille provides a modern-day appraisal of the philosophy of von Hartmann in his introductory essay to the 2001 Edition (3 Volumes) of The Philosophy of the Unconscious. He evaluates von Hartmann as the vital link between the vitalism of Arthur Schopenhauer and the psychology of the Unconscious of Sigmund Freud.

Trained in contemporary experimental composition and Indian classical music, Russell relocated to New York in the mid-1970s, where he became associated with Lower Manhattan's avant-garde community as well as the city's disco scene. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Russell produced a considerable collection of material, including several underground dance hits under aliases such as Dinosaur L and Indian Ocean, but his difficulty in completing projects resulted in a limited amount of released output; 24‚Üí24 Music (1982, as Dinosaur L), Tower of Meaning (1983), and World of Echo (1986) were the only solo albums he released during his lifetime. Over the course of his career, he collaborated with a wide variety of artists, including composers Steve Reich and Philip Glass, poet Allen Ginsberg, musicians such as Peter Gordon, David Van Tieghem, Peter Zummo and David Byrne, and DJs such as Walter Gibbons, Larry Levan, and Nicky Siano. Russell died from AIDS-related illnesses in 1992, still in relative obscurity and nearly broke. Throughout the 2000s, a series of reissues, compilations, books, and a biographical documentary significantly raised his profile. Following his death, several albums of his various unheard recordings were compiled and released, including The World of Arthur Russell (2004) and Calling Out of Context (2004). The documentary Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell was released in 2008. Early life Russell was born and raised in Oskaloosa, Iowa; his father was a former naval officer who eventually served as mayor of the town. As a child and adolescent, he studied the cello and piano and began to compose his own music. When he was 18 he moved to San Francisco, where he lived in a Buddhist commune led by Neville G. Pemchekov Warwick. After earning his high school equivalency, he studied North Indian classical music at the Ali Akbar College of Music and Western composition part-time at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He met Allen Ginsberg, with whom he began to work, accompanying him on the cello as a soloist or in groups while Ginsberg sang or read his poetry. Career =1973‚Äì1975: Early years in New York and The Kitchen= In 1973, Russell moved to New York and enrolled in a formal degree program at the Manhattan School of Music, cross-registering in electronic music and linguistics classes at Columbia University. While studying at the conservatory, Russell repeatedly clashed with Pulitzer Prize-winning serialist composer and instructor Charles Wuorinen, who disparaged the composition \\"City Park\\" (a minimalist, non- narrative suite incorporating readings from the works of Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein) as \\"the most unattractive thing I've ever heard\\". Embittered by his experience, Russell briefly considered transferring to Dartmouth College at the behest of experimental composer Christian Wolff, whom he had sought out and befriended upon arriving in the Northeast. But after a chance meeting at a Wolff concert in Manhattan, he became close with Rhys Chatham, who arranged for Russell to succeed him as music director of The Kitchen, a downtown avant-garde performance space. As a result, he abandoned his studies and remained in New York. Russell and Chatham later briefly roomed together in a sixth-story walkup apartment at 437 East 12th Street in the East Village; Ginsberg (who maintained his primary residence in the building from 1975 to 1996 and helped Russell secure the apartment) supplied electricity to the impoverished composers through an extension cord. Russell resided in the apartment for the rest of his life. During his tenure at The Kitchen (from the autumn of 1974 to the summer of 1975), he greatly expanded the breadth and purview of the venue's offerings, crafting a program that \\"support[ed] other local and relatively low profile composers rather than... accentuat[ing] the work of composers who were beginning to acquire an international reputation.\\" This approach elicited controversy when Russell booked Boston-based proto-punk band The Modern Lovers for an engagement at the venue, widely regarded as a leading bastion of minimalism. Russell's booking of Fluxus stalwart Henry Flynt's \\"punkabilly\\" ensemble Nova'billy, concluding his season as director, was likewise unsettling to the avant-garde establishment. According to biographer Tim Lawrence, \\"the decision to program the Modern Lovers and Talking Heads was Russell‚Äôs way of demonstrating that minimalism could be found outside of compositional music, as well as his belief that pop music could be arty, energetic and fun at the same time.\\" From 1975 to 1979, Russell was a member of The Flying Hearts, recorded by John Hammond, which consisted of Russell (keyboards/vocals), ex-Modern Lovers member Ernie Brooks (bass/vocals), Larry Saltzman (guitar), and David Van Tieghem (drums, vocals); a later incarnation in the 1980s included Joyce Bowden (vocals) and Jesse Chamberlain (drums). This ensemble was frequently augmented in live and studio performances by the likes of Chatham, David Byrne, Jon Gibson, Peter Gordon, Jerry Harrison, Garrett List (who succeeded Russell as musical director of The Kitchen), Andy Paley, Lenny Pickett and Peter Zummo. During the same period, various permutations of this ensemble, together with Glenn Iamaro, Bill Ruyle and Jon Sholle, performed & recorded excerpts from Instrumentals, a 48-hour- long orchestral work that constituted Russell's first major work in the idiom. Selections from the Instrumentals sessions were eventually collected on an eponymously titled album, released by Belgian label Disques du Crepuscule in 1984. The collaboration among Russell (once again as a keyboardist), Brooks, and Chamberlain extended into The Necessaries, a power pop quartet fronted by guitarist Ed Tomney. Their lone 1981 album on Sire Records (initially released as Big Sky before being tweaked and re-released as Event Horizon) featured few songwriting contributions from Russell, who abruptly left the band at the approach to the Holland Tunnel before an important concert in Washington, D.C. =1976‚Äì1980: Discovery of disco and early singles= Around 1976, Russell became a habitue of New York's nascent underground disco scene, namely Nicky Siano's Gallery on Houston Street in SoHo. In a 2007 interview with Wax Poetics magazine, Siano downplayed the popular myth that Russell's interest in the genre solidified over the course of a single night, noting that \\"Louis [Aquilone, Siano's best friend and Russell's then-lover] was at the Gallery every single Saturday night. After spending a few Saturday nights without Louis, Arthur decided to come. After the third or fourth time there, he started to come without Louis\\". Though an eager dancer, Siano has described Russell's style as \\"strange... outrageous, weird... he was definitely a 'white-boy' dancer.\\" By the time Russell was involved with Tom Lee in the 1980s, his nightlife activities had subsided to a large extent. \\"It wasn't like Arthur and I were in some gay disco world, getting dressed to go out to the club and dancing the night away,\\" Lee has said. \\"We‚Äôd go to CBGB, we'd go to Max's Kansas City, we'd go to Tier 3 but we'd listen to the group and then go home. For him it was about the daily grind of actually playing music.\\" In 1977, trenchantly attracted to the minimalist rhythms of disco and funded by Siano's \\"Gallery war chest\\", Russell wrote and co-produced \\"Kiss Me Again\\" in collaboration with a diverse array of musicians‚ÄîFlynt, Zummo, Byrne (on rhythm guitar) and Gloria Gaynor veterans Wilbur Bascomb (bass) and Alan Schwartzberg (drums)‚Äîunder the moniker of Dinosaur L. The first disco single to be released by Sire Records, it was a fairly large club hit, reportedly selling \\"some ungodly amount, like two hundred thousand copies\\". Despite the modicum of commercial success and \\"ecstatic reaction\\" elicited by the record in the New York underground, according to Siano, \\"Ray Caviano [head of Warner/Sire's disco division] never really pushed it,\\" and the record failed to cross over into the mainstream. The song's main hook was interpolated by Desmond Child (who was acquainted with Russell via Larry Salzman) on his minor 1979 hit \\"Our Love Is Insane,\\" leading Russell to accuse the musician of infringement among his friends. Although the duo was signed to Sire to produce a follow-up single featuring Gerri Griffin of the Voices of East Harlem, the sessions stalled because of Siano's burgeoning drug habit (leading him to take temporary refuge in California) and Russell's myopic approach to recording. In 1980, Loose Joints (initially known as the Little All-Stars) was formed with Russell, onetime DJ Steve D'Aquisto, Columbia student and Russell confidante Steven Hall, three singers found on The Loft's dancefloor, miscellaneous other musicians, and the Ingram Brothers rhythm section (best known for later backing Patti LaBelle). With a stated ambition to create \\"the disco White Album\\", the group‚Äîunder contract to leading underground disco label West End Records‚Äîrecorded hours of music but only released three songs: \\"Is It All Over My Face\\", \\"Pop Your Funk\\" (in two disparate arrangements, including a no wave- influenced single edit), and \\"Tell You Today\\". D'Aquisto, a non-musician who favored such extemporaneous touches as off-key singing and the input of street buskers, repeatedly clashed with the perfectionist Russell throughout the sessions. Despite the acrimony, Hall felt that \\"[D'Aquisto] allowed shy Arthur to come out of his shell in the gayest sense. He also taught him how to let go in terms of slavishly and clairvoyantly searching for and then locking in the groove.\\" The experimental recordings bemused many of downtown New York's disco cognoscenti, including West End head Mel Cheren and Loft proprietor David Mancuso, a predicament that led Larry Levan to remix \\"Is It All Over My Face\\" for club play; the ensuing track, based around a female vocal wiped from the original mix (and recorded on stolen studio time with Francois Kevorkian as an uncredited co-mixer) was an enduring staple of Levan's sets at the Paradise Garage and a formative influence on Chicago house, in addition to becoming a bona fide commercial hit in the New York area via airplay on WBLS. In 1981, Russell and entrepreneur Will Socolov (who partially financed the Loose Joints sessions) founded Sleeping Bag Records. Their first release was a recording of 24‚Üí24 Music, a controversial disco-influenced composition (with rhythmic shifts every 24 bars, hence the title) that had been commissioned by and first performed at The Kitchen in 1979. The first limited pressing of this record had a hand made silk-screened cover. Steven Hall later described its debut as \\"the best performance of Arthur's work that I ever attended... it was like really hot dance music and no one got it. The idea that Arthur would turn around and bring that [dance] music into their venue and present it as serious music was really very challenging to them, and very threatening to them.\\" \\"Go Bang,\\" originally released on this album but recorded three years earlier by an ensemble that included Zummo, Peter Gordon, academic/composer Julius Eastman, Bascomb, and John and Jimmy Ingram was remixed as a 12\\" single by Francois Kevorkian. Kevorkian's remix of \\"Go Bang\\" and Levan's remix of \\"In the Cornbelt\\" (another track from the 24‚Üí24 suite) were frequently played at the Paradise Garage. =1983‚Äì1986: Further collaborations and World of Echo= Russell continued to release dance singles such as \\"Tell You Today\\" (4th and Broadway, 1983), an upbeat dance groove and Loose Joints holdover featuring the vocals of Joyce Bowden. Additional releases that followed included \\"Wax the Van\\" (Jump Street, 1987) and \\"I Need More\\" (Vinylmania, 1988), which paired Russell with erstwhile James Brown foil Lola Blank (then married to Bob Blank, Russell's preferred studio engineer); the Peter Zummo collaboration \\"School Bell/Treehouse\\" (Sleeping Bag, 1986); and \\"Let's Go Swimming\\" (Upside/Rough Trade, 1986), which anticipated later developments in tech house and was Russell's only dance single to be released under his own name. The latter two records were remixed by legendary 70s-era DJ Walter Gibbons, who had renounced his career for evangelical Christianity and was employed as a buyer at Rock and Soul Records in Midtown. Despite Gibbons's religious predilections, the two forged a dependable (if occasionally tempestuous) working relationship. Further Gibbons/Russell collaborations include \\"C-Thru\\" (a dance version of \\"See Through\\" on World of Echo that remained unreleased until 2010) and a remix of Russell's \\"Calling All Kids\\" (eventually released on the 2004 compilation Calling out of Context). At the same time, the album Tower of Meaning (Chatham Square) was released in a limited pressing on Philip Glass's private label. The recording was made up of incidental music intended to accompany director Robert Wilson's staging of Medea, a partnership arranged by Glass. Although widely perceived as an important breakthrough for Russell in the compositional world, creative squabbling between the downtown luminaries culminated in Wilson barring the composer from attending rehearsals and eventually ousting Russell from the project altogether in favor of British composer Gavin Bryars. The \\"compelling and meditative recording\\", conducted by Julius Eastman, represents just a fragment of Russell's score, which includes voices along with its instrumentation. While Russell tangentially remained affiliated with the new music sphere in New York until his death, continuing to perform in solo and group configurations at The Kitchen and Experimental Intermedia Foundation, Tower of Meaning was his final orchestral effort. The rejection of Russell's Corn album (a suite of hip-hop-infused electropop including material later released on Calling Out of Context) by Socolov in 1985, coupled with creative disagreements between the two over \\"Wax the Van\\", resulted in Russell divesting himself from Sleeping Bag Records shortly after the release of \\"Schoolbell/Treehouse\\" in 1986. According to Bob Blank in a followup to an Internet reposting of the (purportedly fallacious) 1986 article that detailed the subterfuge, Socolov \\"wanted to take the label to 'another level\\". During the mid-1980s, Russell gave many performances, either accompanying himself on cello with a myriad of effects, or working with a small ensemble consisting of Steven Hall, Ernie Brooks, Peter Zummo, percussionist Mustafa Ahmed, and composer Elodie Lauten. September 1986 saw the release of World of Echo (Upside/Rough Trade, 1986). Heralded as \\"a magnum opus of sorts\\" by contemporary critics, it incorporated many of his ideas for pop, dance and classical music for both solo and cello format. The album was well-reviewed in Britain and included in Melody Maker's \\"Top Thirty Releases of 1986\\", but a complete failure commercially. Russell also collaborated with a number of choreographers, including John Bernd, Diane Madden, Alison Salzinger and Stephanie Woodard. =1986‚Äì1992: Later work, illness, and death= Shortly after the release of World of Echo, Russell was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Though the disease caused throat cancer (forcing Russell to undergo chemotherapy), he remained prolific, working on voice-and-cello songs for an album to be released by Philip Glass's Point Music (some of which surfaced on the posthumous Another Thought in 1994) and an electronic pop album (influenced by the likes of 808 State and William Orbit and provisionally titled 1-800-Dinosaur) for Rough Trade Records. Much of the material intended for this project was included on 2004's Calling Out of Context. Although Russell reportedly planned to submit the album in the summer of 1987, he continued tinkering with potential songs for another four years. According to Rough Trade founder Geoff Travis, \\"It was frustrating, but I knew he needed my support to keep financing his music.\\" Russell died of AIDS- related illnesses on April 4, 1992, at the age of 40. In an April 28 column, Kyle Gann of The Village Voice wrote: \\"His recent performances had been so infrequent due to illness, his songs were so personal, that it seems as though he simply vanished into his music.\\" Russell was prolific, but was also notorious for leaving songs unfinished and continually revising his music. Ernie Brooks said Russell \\"never arrived at a completed version of anything.\\" Peter Gordon stated, \\"his quest wasn't really to do a finished product but more to do with exploring his different ways of working musically.\\" He left behind more than 1,000 tapes when he died, 40 of them different mixes of one song. According to Russell archivist Steve Knutson, the musician's estate consists of around 800 reels of 2\\" and ¬º\\" tape, \\"another few hundred cassettes, several dozen DAT tapes, hundreds and hundreds of pages of song lyrics and poetry\\".Steve Knutson interview in Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell. Personal life As a young adult, Russell led a seemingly heterosexual lifestyle; at least two of these relationships (with Muriel Fujii in San Francisco and later Sydney Murray in New York) have been substantiated. Although he briefly dated Allen Ginsberg in 1973, Russell did not identify as a gay man until becoming involved with hairdresser Louis Aquilone in 1976. After the relationship with Aquilone dissolved, Russell dated Donald Murk (who subsequently became Russell's manager) for several years. According to Steven Hall, the relationship was tempestuous, \\"with lots of threesomes and fighting and very dramatic emotional scenes\\". As this relationship drew to a close, Russell became acquainted with silkscreen operator Tom Lee; their friendship rapidly evolved into a domestic partnership. Although Russell continued to see other men and women, their partnership endured until his death in 1992. Lee, who became a schoolteacher and continued to reside in the couple's rent- controlled East Village apartment until February 2011, is the executor of Russell's estate. Their relationship is detailed at length in Matt Wolf's Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell. Legacy and influence Though never achieving great success during his lifetime, Russell has been acknowledged as an important influence on a variety of musical developments and artists in recent years. In 2004, Stylus described him as \\"criminally overlooked for far too long\\" and \\"a genius‚Äînever to be recognized in his own time, but to be enjoyed by generations to come.\\" PopMatters noted \\"the contributions Russell made to the disparate genres of dance, disco, dub, and experimental music\\" and wrote that \\"his absolute fearlessness in lending his own unique style to even the most unlikely sound combinations is peerless.\\" Pitchfork called Russell \\"a changeling artist whose only parallel might be Miles Davis, constantly placing his individual sound in new contexts, constantly searching.\\" Artists who have cited Russell as an influence include Dev Hynes and James Murphy. James Blake named his club night and record label after Russell's provisionally titled album \\"1-800-Dinosaur\\". Planningtorock covered Russell's song \\"Janine\\" on their album W in 2011, and former Everything But The Girl singer Tracey Thorn covered \\"Get Around to It\\" on her 2007 solo album Out of the Woods. A tribute EP, Four Songs by Arthur Russell, curated by Jens Lekman, was released in 2007 through Rough Trade Records. In 2016, rapper Kanye West released a track entitled \\"30 Hours\\" which prominently samples Russell's \\"Answers Me. \\" In 2018, American musician and composer Peter Broderick released the compilation album Peter Broderick & Friends Play Arthur Russell containing cover versions of songs written by Russell. Filmmaker Matt Wolf completed a feature-length documentary on Russell called Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell. It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 13, 2008. Tim Lawrence, an author and academic at the University of East London, has written a biography of Russell, entitled Hold On to Your Dreams: Arthur Russell and the Downtown Music Scene, published in 2009. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a documentary \\"Arthur Russell: Vanished into Music\\" on September 27, 2016. The album Tower of Meaning was re- released in 2016 on Audika Records, while material of the album was performed live by the London Contemporary Orchestra in January 2017.

The game evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. References to baseball date back to the 1700s where in England it was known as a game called rounders. Rounders is referenced in 1744 in the children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book where it was called Baseball. In 1871 the first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, was founded. Five years later, the National League was created; it was followed by the American League in 1901. The first World Series between the champions of the two major leagues was held in 1903, and by 1905 it became an annual event. Baseball early in the 20th century was characterized by low-scoring games, but the dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with rule changes and the rise of power hitter Babe Ruth. The major leagues had a color barrier that lasted until 1947, when Jackie Robinson made his debut. The major leagues began the process of expansion in 1961 and attendance increase from the mid-1970s to 1994, when a work stoppage led to the cancellation of the World Series. Professional baseball leagues featured teams from Canada as early as 1877, and the sport spread to numerous countries in the 1800s and 1900s. It was played in the Olympics as a medal sport from 1992 to 2008. Other competitions between national teams include the Baseball World Cup and the World Baseball Classic, which was first held in 2006.  Origins  Cantigas de Santa Maria, c. 1280, involving tossing a ball, hitting it with a stick and competing with others to catch it The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.Block (2005), pp. 106‚Äì108. Other old French games such as th√®que, la balle au b√¢ton, and la balle empoisonn√©e also appear to be related.Block (2005), pp. 71‚Äì72, 75, 89, 147‚Äì149, 150, 160, et seq. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and \\"tut-ball\\".Block (2005), pp. 86, 87, 111‚Äì113, 118‚Äì121, 135‚Äì138, 144, 160; Rader (2008), p. 7. It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders. A Little Pretty Pocket-Book (1744), included an illustration of base-ball, depicting a batter, a bowler, and three rounders posts. The rhyme refers to the ball being hit, the boy running to the next post, and then home to score. Updated to four bases by 1828, rounders has remained extremely popular among children in the UK. The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British children's publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of \\"base-ball\\" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game‚Äîthough in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.Block (2005), pp. 139, 140, 151, 164, 178, 179, et seq.; See Wikisource edition of A Little Pretty Pocket-Book. Block discovered that the first recorded game of \\"Bass- Ball\\" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the United States by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house.Block (2005), pp. 58, 160, 300, 307, 310; By 1796, a version of the game was well known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, \\"englische Base-ball\\" involved a contest between two teams, in which \\"the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate.\\" Only one out was required to retire a side.Block (2005), pp. 67‚Äì75, 181; Gutsmuths quoted: p. 86. In 1828, William Clarke in London published the second edition of The Boy's Own Book, which included the rules of rounders and contained the first printed description in English of a bat and ball base-running game played on a diamond.David Block (2006) ‚ÄúBaseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game‚Äù p. 192. University of Nebraska Press. The following year, the book was published in Boston, Massachusetts.\\"The Boys Own Book by William Clarke\\". Maine Historical Society. Retrieved April 6, 2019 By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as \\"town ball\\", though other names such as \\"round-ball\\" and \\"base-ball\\" were also used.Block (2005), pp. 4‚Äì5, 11‚Äì15, 25, 33, 59‚Äì61, et. seq. Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description‚Äîalbeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to Sporting Life magazine‚Äîtook place in Beachville, Ontario, in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or byes); first bye just from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce.Sullivan (1997), pp. 9‚Äì11. The once widely accepted story that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians.Block (2005), pp. xiv‚Äìxix, 15‚Äì18, 32‚Äì38, 42‚Äì47, et seq.; Rader (2008), pp. 7, 93‚Äì94. The Doubleday myth appeared after a dispute arose about the origins of baseball and whether it had been invented in the United States or developed as a variation of rounders.Seymour (1989), pp. 8‚Äì9. The theory that the sport was created in the U.S. was backed by Chicago Cubs president Albert Spalding and National League president Abraham G. Mills. In 1889, Mills gave a speech declaring that baseball was American, which he said was determined through \\"patriotism and research\\"; a crowd of about 300 people responding by chanting \\"No rounders!\\" The rounders theory was supported by prominent sportswriter Henry Chadwick, a native of Britain who noted common factors between rounders and baseball in a 1903 article.Seymour (1989), p. 9. In 1905, Spalding called for an investigation into how the sport was invented. Chadwick supported the idea, and later in the year the Mills commission was formed. Spalding instructed the commission to decide between the American game of \\"Old Cat\\" and rounders as baseball's predecessor. Seven men served on the commission, including Mills. Spalding chose the committee's members, picking men who supported his theory and excluding supporters of the rounders claim, such as Chadwick.Ryczek, pp. 20‚Äì21. Alexander Cartwright, father of modern baseball In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, produced a code of baseball rules now called the Knickerbocker Rules.Sullivan (1997), p. 292. The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of \\"soaking\\" or \\"plugging\\"‚Äîeffecting a putout by hitting a runner with a thrown ball‚Äîwas barred. The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching was allowed.Block (2005), p. 84; Koppett (2004), p. 2; Rader (2008), p. 8; Sullivan (1997), p. 10. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the \\"New York Nine\\" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23‚Äì1, in four innings.Sullivan (1997), pp. 32, 80, 95. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.Tygiel (2000), pp. 8‚Äì14; Rader (2008), pp. 71‚Äì72.  In the United States  = Professional leagues develop = In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area.Rader (2008), pp. 9, 10. By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the \\"national pastime\\" or \\"national game.\\"Tygiel (2000), p. 6. A year later, 16 area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a fair ball on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by African Americans.Rader (2008), p. 27; Sullivan (1997), pp. 68, 69. The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams. They still remain as baseball's only undefeated team during the regular season. Sullivan (1997), pp. 43, 73. The first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute its status as a major league.Sullivan (1997), pp. 83‚Äì87. The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes referred to as the \\"senior circuit.\\"Sullivan (1997), pp. 83, 130, 243. Several other major leagues formed and failed. In 1884, African American Moses Walker (and, briefly, his brother Welday) played in one of these, the American Association.Zoss (2004), p. 136. An injury ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a gentlemen's agreement in the form of the baseball color line effectively barred black players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor.Zoss (2004), p. 102. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. Several independent African American teams succeeded as barnstormers.Sullivan (1997), p. 115. Also in 1884, overhand pitching was legalized.Rader (2008), p. 71. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game.Heaphy, Leslie, \\"Women Playing Hardball\\", in Baseball and Philosophy: Thinking Outside the Batter's Box, ed. Eric Bronson (Open Court, 2004), pp. 246‚Äì256 [247] Virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893; the last major change‚Äîcounting foul balls as strikes‚Äîwas instituted in 1901. The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established that year.Sullivan (1997), pp. 243‚Äì246. The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought for the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes.Sullivan (1997), p. 13. New York Giants baseball team, 1913. Fred Merkle, sixth in line, had committed a baserunning gaffe in a crucial 1908 game that became famous as Merkle's Boner. A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues.Rader (2008), p. 110; Zimbalist (2006), p. 22. See The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League.Sullivan (1997), pp. 13‚Äì16. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion.Sullivan (1997), pp. 141‚Äì150; Sullivan (1998), pp. 8‚Äì10. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.Koppett (2004), p. 99. As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check.Burk (2001), pp. 56, 100, 102, 103, 113, 143, 147, 170, et seq.; Powers (2003), pp. 17‚Äì21, 27, 83, 121, 122, 160‚Äì164, 177; Rader (2008), pp. 60‚Äì71. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together.Powers (2003), pp. 39, 47, 48. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.Burgos (2007), pp. 117, 118. = Rise of Ruth and racial integration = Babe Ruth in 1920, the year he joined the New York Yankees Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers, including stars Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson, were more dominant. The \\"inside game\\", which demanded that players \\"scratch for runs\\", was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent Ty Cobb epitomized this style.Sullivan (1997), p. 214. The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed- up with foreign substances, followed the death of Ray Chapman after a pitch struck him in the head in August 1920. Coupled with superior materials available after World War I, this resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of reducing the distance to the outfield fences, making home runs more common.Zoss (2004), p. 90. The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the New York Yankees, built a reputation as the majors' premier team.Zoss (2004), p. 192. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern \\"farm system\\".Burk (2001), pp. 34‚Äì37. A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939 Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for children's baseball leagues across the United States. alt=Robinson posing in the uniform cap of the Kansas City Royals, a Jackie Robinson in 1945, with the era's Kansas City Royals, a barnstorming squad associated with the Negro American League's Kansas City Monarchs With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye‚Äîthe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League existed from 1943 to 1954. The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten rules barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers‚Äîwhere Branch Rickey had become general manager‚Äîand began playing for their minor league team in Montreal.Burgos (2007), p. 158. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; Larry Doby debuted with the American League's Cleveland Indians later the same year.Burgos (2007), pp. 180, 191. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Mi√±oso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars.Powers (2003), p. 111. Facing competition as varied as television and football, baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved.Rader (2008), p. 3; Bjarkman (2005), p. xxxvii.Simmons, Rob, \\"The Demand for Spectator Sports\\", in Handbook on the Economics of Sport, ed. Wladimir Andreff and Stefan Szymanski (Edward Elgar, 2006), pp. 77‚Äì89. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years.Powers (2003), p. 170. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.Burgos (2007), p. 215. The majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year.Heaphy (2003), pp. 121, 218‚Äì224. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball.Koppett (2004), pp. 307, 308; Sullivan (2002), pp. 163, 164. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961‚Äì62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.Blair (2012), pp. 59‚Äì61. = Attendance records and the age of steroids = In May 2010, the Philadelphia Phillies' Roy Halladay pitched the 20th major league perfect game. That October, he pitched only the second no-hitter in MLB postseason history. The players' union became bolder under the leadership of former United Steelworkers chief economist and negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966.Powers (2003), pp. 170, 172‚Äì175. On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1‚Äì25.4 cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks.Powers (2003), pp. 156‚Äì168, 175, 176. In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the designated hitter rule the following year.Sullivan (2002), p. 239. In 1975, the union's power‚Äîand players' salaries‚Äîbegan to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system.Powers (2003), pp. 178, 180, 245. In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years.Powers (2003), pp. 184‚Äì187, 191, 192, 280‚Äì282. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.Koppett (2004), pp. 376, 511. The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production‚Äîthe number of home runs in particular‚Äîhad surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season.Rader (2008), pp. 249, 250. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set.Koppett (2004), p. 481. The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions‚Äîsuch as player discipline and umpire supervision‚Äîthey had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major League Baseball (MLB).Koppett (2004), p. 489. In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004.Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271; Zimbalist (2007), pp. 195, 196; In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs. Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds‚Äîas well as many other players, including storied pitcher Roger Clemens‚Äîhave been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal, their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction.Powers (2003), pp. 292‚Äì293; Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271, 275‚Äì277. In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade. With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the \\"Year of the Pitcher\\". Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century. Before the start of the 2012 season, MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams admitted into the playoffs to two per league. The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual one-game playoffs between the wild card teams in each league.  Around the world  Baseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both countries.Bjarkman (2004), p. 73; Burk (2001), p. 58. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals. Sadaharu Oh managing the Japan national team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Playing for the Central League's Yomiuri Giants (1959‚Äì80), Oh set the professional world record for home runs. In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz. A few days after the Battle of Cerro Gordo, they used the \\"wooden leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General Santa Anna\\".Terry (1909), p. 506. The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the Cuban Revolution). The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912.Bjarkman (2004), pp. xxiv. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938).Bjarkman (2004), pp. xxiv, 11, 123, 137, 233, 356; Gmelch (2006), p. 296. The Japanese major leagues‚Äîthe Central League and Pacific League‚Äîhave long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.McNeil (2000), p. 113. Japan has a professional minor league system as well, though it is much smaller than the American version‚Äîeach team has only one farm club in contrast to MLB teams' four or five. After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955).Bjarkman (2004), pp. xxiv, xxv; Burgos (2007), p. 46. Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.Bjarkman (2004), pp. 362, 368; Gmelch (2006), pp. 100, 75, 59. Many European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, other than the Dutch league, being the Italian league founded in 1948.Bjarkman (2004), p. xv. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The Israel Baseball League, launched in 2007, folded after one season. The Conf√©d√©ration Europ√©ene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries. Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the Women's Baseball World Cup, featuring national teams. After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning at the 1992 Summer Olympics, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympics at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic. References  Sources       * ","title":"History of baseball"},{"id":"602676","text":"The question of the origins of baseball has been the subject of debate and controversy for more than a century. Baseball and the other modern bat, ball, and running games‚Äîcricket and rounders‚Äîwere developed from folk games in early Britain, Ireland, and Continental Europe (such as France and Germany). Early forms of baseball had a number of names, including \\"base ball\\", \\"goal ball\\", \\"round ball\\", \\"fetch-catch\\", \\"stool ball\\", and, simply, \\"base\\". In at least one version of the game, teams pitched to themselves, runners went around the bases in the opposite direction of today's game, much like in the Nordic br√§nnboll, and players could be put out by being hit with the ball. Just as now, in some versions a batter was called out after three strikes. Although much is unclear, as one would expect of children's games of long ago, this much is known: by the mid-18th century a game had appeared in the south of England which involved striking a pitched ball and then running a circuit of bases. \\"Base ball\\" was at least one name for this proto-baseball, although there may have been others. English colonists took this game to America with their other pastimes, and in the early 1800s variants were being played on both sides of the ocean under many appellations. However, the game was very significantly altered by amateur men's ball clubs in and around New York City in the middle of the 19th century, and it was this heavily revised sport that became modern baseball. Folk games in early Britain, Ireland and continental Europe Canticles of Holy Mary', 13th Century. A number of folk games in early Britain and continental Europe had characteristics that can be seen in modern baseball (as well as in cricket and rounders). Many of these early games involved a ball that was thrown at a target while an opposing player defended the target by attempting to hit the ball away. If the batter successfully hit the ball, he could attempt to score points by running between bases while fielders would attempt to catch or retrieve the ball and put the runner out. Folk games differed over time, place, and culture, resulting in similar yet variant forms. These games had no standard documented rules and instead were played according to historical customs. These games tended to be played by working classes, peasants, and children. Early folk games were often associated with earlier religious ceremonies and worship rituals. These games became discouraged and even altogether prohibited by subsequent governing states and religious authorities. Aside from obvious differences in terminology, the games differed in the equipment used (ball, bat, club, target, etc., which were usually just whatever was available), the way in which the ball was thrown, the method of scoring, the method of making outs, the layout of the field and the number of players involved. Very broadly speaking, these games can be roughly divided into forms of longball, where the batter ran out to a single point or line and back, as in cricket, and roundball, where there was a circuit of multiple bases. There were also games (e.g. stool-ball, trap-ball) which involved no running at all. =OinƒÉ= OinƒÉ is a Romanian traditional sport, a form of longball similar in many ways to lapta. The name \\"oinƒÉ\\" was originally \\"hoina\\", and is derived from the Cuman word oyn \\"game\\" (a cognate of Turkish oyun).oinƒÉ , in Alexandru CiorƒÉnescu, Dic»õionarul etimologic rom√¢n, Universidad de la Laguna, Tenerife, 1958-1966. The oldest direct mention comes from a diet manual of 1782 by medic Istv√°n M√°tyus, who talks about the health benefits of oina. In 1899, Spiru Haret, the minister of education decided that oinƒÉ was to be played in schools in physical education classes. He organized the first annual oinƒÉ competitions. The Romanian OinƒÉ Federation (\\"Federa≈£ia Rom√¢nƒÉ de OinƒÉ\\") was founded in 1932, and was reactivated at the beginning of the 1950s, after a brief period when it was dissolved. Today, there are two oinƒÉ federations: one in Bucharest, Romania and another one in Chi≈üinƒÉu, Moldova. =Stoolball= In an 1802 book entitled The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, Joseph Strutt claimed to have shown that baseball-like games can be traced back to the 14th century, in particular an English game called stoolball. The earliest known reference to stoolball is in a 1330 poem by William Pagula, who recommended to priests that the game be forbidden within churchyards. In stoolball, one player throws the ball at a target while another player defends the target. Originally, the target was defended with a bare hand. Later, a bat of some kind was used (in modern stoolball, a bat like a very heavy table tennis paddle is used). \\"Stob-ball\\" and \\"stow-ball\\" were regional games similar to stoolball. What the target originally was in stoolball is not certain; it was possibly a tree stump, since \\"stob\\" and \\"stow\\" all mean stump in some local dialects. (\\"Stow\\" could also refer to a type of frame used in mining). It is notable that in cricket to this day, the uprights of the wicket are called \\"stumps\\". Of course, the target could well have been whatever was convenient, perhaps even a gravestone (hence Pagula's objection to churchyard play). A 17th-century book on games specifies a stool. According to one legend, milkmaids played stoolball while waiting for their husbands to return from the fields. Another theory is that stoolball developed as a game played after attending church services, in which case the target was probably a church stool. An 18th-century poem depicts men and women playing together (the women using their aprons to catch batted balls), and it and other references associate the game especially with the Easter season. There were several versions of stoolball. In the earliest versions, the object was primarily to defend the stool. Successfully defending the stool counted for one point, and the batter was out if the ball hit the stool. There was no running involved. Another version of stoolball involved running between two stools, and scoring was similar to the scoring in cricket. In perhaps yet another version there were several stools, and points were scored by running around them as in baseball. When Englishmen came to America, they brought stoolball with them. William Bradford in his diary for Christmas Day, 1621, noted (with disapproval) how the men of Plymouth were \\"frolicking in √æe street, at play openly; some pitching √æe barre, some at stoole-ball and shuch-like sport\\". Because of the different versions of stoolball, and because it was played not only in England, but also in colonial America, stoolball is considered by many to have been the common ancestor of cricket, baseball and rounders. =Dog and cat= Another early folk game was \\"dog and cat\\" (or \\"cat and dog\\"), which probably originated in Scotland. In cat and dog a piece of wood called a cat is thrown at a hole in the ground while another player defends the hole with a stick (a dog). In some cases there were two holes and, after hitting the cat, the batter would run between them while fielders would try to get the runner out by putting the cat in the hole before the runner got to it. Dog and cat thus resembled cricket. =Horne-billets= This game, otherwise unknown, was described in Francis Willughby's Book of Games (ca. 1670), which included rules for over 130 pastimes including stool-ball and stow-ball. It is significant in that it involved both a bat and base-running, although it was played with a wooden cat rather than a ball and the multiple \\"bases\\" were holes in the ground: the batter reached safety by putting the end of his bat in a hole before the fielders could put the cat in it. This has echoes in cricket's manner of scoring runs by touching the bat to the ground across the crease before the fielders can hit the nearby wicket with the ball.Cram, David; Forgeng, Jeffrey L; Johnston, Dorothy, Francis Willoughby's Book of Games: A Seventeenth Century Treatise on Sports, Games, and Pastimes. Ashgate Publishing (2002) =Trap ball= In trap ball, played in England since the 14th century, a ball was thrown in the air, to be hit by a batsman and fielded. In some variants a member of the fielding team threw the ball in the air; in some, the batter tossed it himself as in fungo; in others, the batsman caused the ball to be tossed in the air by a simple lever mechanism: versions of this, called bat and trap and Knurr and spell, are still played in some English pubs. In trap-ball there was no running, instead the fielders attempted to throw the ball back to within a certain distance of the batter's station. Trap-ball may be the origin of the concept of foul lines; in most variants the ball had to be hit between two posts to count. A related game was tip-cat; in this, the \\"cat\\" was an oblong piece of wood (as in dog-and-cat); it tapered toward each end, rather like a rugby ball or American football, so that striking one end would flip it into the air much like the trap in trap- ball so that it could be struck with a stick or bat. =Base= An old English game called \\"base\\" or \\"prisoners' base\\", described by George Ewing at Valley Forge, was apparently not much like baseball. There was no bat and no ball involved. The game was more like a fancy game of team \\"tag\\", although it did share the concept of places of safety, bases, with baseball. =Cricket = The history of cricket prior to 1650 is something of a mystery. Games believed to have been similar to cricket had developed by the 13th century. There was a game called \\"creag\\", and another game, \\"Handyn and Handoute\\" (Hands In and Hands Out), which was made illegal in 1477 by King Edward IV, who considered the game childish, and a distraction from compulsory archery practice. References to a game actually called \\"cricket\\" appeared around 1550. It is believed that the word cricket is based either on the word cric, meaning a crooked stick (cognate with English crook): early forms of cricket used a curved bat somewhat like a hockey stick; or on a Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (\\"with the stick chase\\"), or on the Flemish word \\"krickstoel\\", which refers to a stool upon which one kneels in church and which the early long, low wicket resembled. The word is etymologically related to French croquet- early forms of which were also played with a curved stick rather than a mallet. The earliest known mention of baseball, as a children's game, dates from the same year (1744) in which the Artillery Ground Laws formalised the rules of what was already a first-class, professional sport sponsored by nobility and upon which vast wagers were laid. English colonists played cricket along with their other games from home, and it is mentioned many times in 18th-century American sources. As an organized sport, the Toronto Cricket Club was established in that city by 1827 and the St George's Cricket Club was formed in 1838 in New York City (membership restricted to British-born men). Teams from the two clubs faced off in the first international cricket game in 1844 which Toronto won by 23 runs. Many of the early New York club baseball players were also cricketers, and the earliest recorded inter-club baseball game was played on the Union Star Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn. =Rounders= The British game most similar to baseball, and most mentioned as its ancestor or nearest relation, is rounders.\\"Rounders (English Game)\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Like baseball, the object is to strike a pitched ball with a bat and then run a circuit of four bases to score. The batter must strike at a good ball and run in an anti-clockwise direction around the first, second, and third base and home to the fourth, though they may stay at any of the first three. A batter is out if the ball is caught; if the base to which they are running to is touched with the ball; or if, while running, they are touched with the ball by a fielder. Nine players constitute a team, with the fielding side consisting of the bowler, the backstop (catcher), a player on each of the four bases, and three deep fielders. Popular among British and Irish school children, and especially among girls, as of 2015 rounders is played by seven million children in the UK.‚ÄúFair Play for Girls and Boys‚Äù. National Teachers Organisation. Retrieved March 9, 2018 However, in the 19th century rounders was a popular sport for grown men, as Irish Rounders remains today, and for much of the Victorian period regimental teams played for an Army championship. In 1828, William Clarke in London published the second edition of The Boy's Own Book, which included the rules of rounders (in fact the earliest known use of that name), and the first printed description in English of a bat and ball base-running game played on a diamond.David Block (2006) Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game p. 192. University of Nebraska Press. Retrieved May 6, 2011 The following year, the book was published in Boston, Massachusetts.\\"The Boys Own Book by William Clarke\\". Maine Historical Society. Retrieved May 7, 2011 The exact same rules were reprinted verbatim in Robin Carver's The Book of Sports (Boston, 1834), except they were headed not \\"Rounders\\" but \\"Base, or Goal-ball.\\" =British baseball= A unique British sport, known as British baseball, is still played in parts of Wales and England. Although confined mainly to the cities of Cardiff, Newport and Liverpool, the sport boasts an annual international game between representative teams from the two countries. British \\"baseball\\", however, is much more akin to rounders, as it was in fact called until 1892, and represents a rounders variant somewhat hybridized under the influence of 19th- century American touring teams; it is in fact the last survival in Great Britain of the once-widespread adult club rounders. Early mentions of baseball According to many sources, the earliest appearance of the word \\"baseball\\" dates from 1700, when Anglican bishop Thomas Wilson expressed his disapproval of \\"Morris-dancing, cudgel-playing, baseball and cricket\\" occurring on Sundays. However, David Block, in Baseball Before We Knew It (2005), reports that the original source has \\"stoolball\\" for \\"baseball\\". Block also reports the reference appears to date to 1672, rather than 1700. Woodcut from the 1744 British children's book A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, showing rounders posts and the first reference to baseball A 1744 book in England by children's publisher John Newbery called A Little Pretty Pocket-Book includes a woodcut of a game similar to three-base stoolball or rounders and a rhyme entitled \\"Base-Ball\\". This is the first known instance of the word baseball in print. In 1755, a book entitled The Card by John Kidgell, in volume 1 on page 9, mentions baseball: \\"the younger Part of the Family, perceiving Papa not inclined to enlarge upon the matter, retired to an interrupted Party at Base- Ball (an infant Game, which as it advances in its teens, improved into Fives).\\" Although A Little Pretty Pocket-Book first appeared eleven years earlier, no copies of the first or other early editions have surfaced to date, only the tenth and later editions from 1760 forward. Therefore, The Card was the oldest surviving reference to baseball until the Bray diary was discovered in 2008. The earliest recorded game of base-ball involved none other than the family of the Prince of Wales, played indoors in London in November 1748. The Prince is reported as playing \\"Bass-Ball\\" again in September 1749 in Walton- on-Thames, Surrey, against Lord Middlesex. The English lawyer William Bray wrote in his diary that he had played a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, also in Surrey. The word \\"baseball\\" first appeared in a dictionary in 1768, in A General Dictionary of the English Language compiled by the editors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (first published the same year), with the unhelpful definition \\"A rural game in which the person striking the ball must run to his base or goal.\\" Gutsmuth's diagram of englische Base-ball, depicting the bat and the playing field. By 1796, the rules of this English game were well enough established to earn a mention in the German Johann Gutsmuths' book on popular pastimes. In it he described \\"\\" ('Ball with safe places, or the English base-ball') as a contest between two teams in which \\"the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate\\"; only one out was required to retire a side. Gutsmuth included a diagram of the field which was very similar to that of town ball. Notably, Gutsmuths is the earliest author to explicitly mention the use of a bat, although in this case it was a flat wooden paddle about 18 inches long, swung one-handed. Block (2005), pp. 67‚Äì75, 181; Gutsmuths quoted: p. 86.https://protoball.org/Englische_Base-ball The French book is the second known book to contain printed rules of a batting/base/running game. It was printed in Paris in 1810 and lays out the rules for (\\"poisoned ball\\"), in which there were two teams of eight to ten players, four bases (one called home), a pitcher, a batter, \\"soaking\\" and flyball outs; however, the ball apparently was struck by the hand. Another early print reference is Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey, originally written 1798‚Äì1799. In the first chapter the young English heroine Catherine Morland is described as preferring \\"cricket, base ball, riding on horseback and running about the country to books\\". About the same time, Austen's cousin Cassandra Cooke mentioned baseball in her novel Battleridge. In her 1820s \\"Village Sketch\\" Jack Hatch, author Mary Russell Mitford wrote: In 1828, William Clarke of London published the second edition of The Boy‚Äôs Own Book, which included the earliest known mention of a game called \\"rounders,\\" and contains under that heading the first printed description in English of a bat and ball base-running game played on a diamond. The following year, the book was published in Boston, Massachusetts. Similar rules were published in Boston in The Book of Sports, written by Robin Carver in 1834, except Carver called the game \\"Base or Goal ball\\". Clarke's \\"rounders\\" description would be reprinted many times on both sides of the Atlantic in ensuing decades, under various names. Early baseball in America Charting the evolution of the game that became modern baseball is difficult before 1845. The Knickerbocker Rules describe a game that they had been playing for some time. But how long is uncertain and so is how the game had developed. Shane Foster was the first to come up with suspicions of how the origin came into effect. There were once two camps. One, mostly English, asserted that baseball evolved from a game of English origin (probably rounders); the other, almost entirely American, said that baseball was an American invention (perhaps derived from the game of one-ol'-cat). Apparently they saw their positions as mutually exclusive. Some of their points seem more national loyalty than evidence: Americans tended to reject any suggestion that baseball evolved from an English game, while some English observers concluded that baseball was little more than their rounders without the round. One English author went so far as to declare that the Knickerbocker Club comprised English expatriates who introduced \\"their\\" game to America for the first time in 1845. The Mills Commission, at the other extreme, created an \\"official\\" and entirely fictional All-American version attributing the game's invention to Abner Doubleday in 1839 at Cooperstown, New York (current site of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum). Both were entirely wrong, since this much is clear: baseball, or a game called \\"base ball\\", had been played in America for many years by then. The earliest explicit reference to the game in America is from March 1786 in the diary of a student at Princeton, John Rhea Smith: \\"A fine day, play baste ball in the campus but am beaten for I miss both catching and striking the ball.\\"McNeil, William F., The Evolution of Pitching in Major League Baseball, McFarland & Co (2006) , p. 8 There is a possible reference a generation older, from Harvard; describing the campus buttery in the 1760s, Sidney Willard wrote \\"Besides eatables, everything necessary for a student was there sold, and articles used in the playgrounds, such as bats, balls etc. ‚Ä¶ Here it was that we wrestled and ran, played at quoits and cricket, and various games of bat and ball.\\" A 1791 bylaw in Pittsfield, Massachusetts banned the playing of \\"any game of wicket, cricket, baseball, batball, football, cats, fives, or any other game played with ball\\" within 80 yards of the town meeting house to prevent damage to its windows. Worcester, Massachusetts outlawed playing baseball \\"in the streets\\" in 1816. There are other mentions of baseball during the early 19th century. The April 25, 1823 edition of the (New York) National Advocate included this: Two years later the following notice appeared in the July 13, 1825 edition of the Delhi (New York) Gazette: \\"The undersigned, all residents of the new town of Hamden, with the exception of Asa Howland, who has recently removed into Delhi, challenge an equal number of persons of any town in the County of Delaware, to meet them at any time at the house of Edward B. Chace, in said town, to play the game of Bass-Ball, for the sum of one dollar each per game.\\" Thurlow Weed in his memoir recalled organized club baseball in Rochester, New York in 1825: The first recorded game of baseball under the later codified rules was played in New York on September 23, 1845 between the New York Baseball Club and the Kickerbocker Baseball Club. American baseball was allegedly played in Beachville, Ontario in 1838. However there is no consensus as to the rules that were used or whether it can be considered the first \\"baseball\\" game. A firsthand account and the rules of the game were recalled by Dr. Adam E. Ford, who had witnessed the game as a six-year-old boy, in an 1886 issue of The Sporting Life magazine in Denver, Colorado; he described the game in remarkable detail, including the precise distances between the irregular bases and how the ball was constructed. However, some historians, such as David Block, have expressed doubts as to the veracity and rather incredible specificity of Ford's memory, and indeed compared it to Abner Graves' very similar yarn about Abner Doubleday.Block, David, Baseball Before We Knew It. Lincloln, NE: Bison Books, 2006. pp. 61-66 In that letter, Ford refers to 'old grayhairs' at the time, who had played this game as children, suggesting that the origins of baseball in Canada go back into the 18th century. Very similar instances were recorded by John Montgomery Ward in his 1888 book Base-Ball: How to Become a Player, with the Origins, History and Explanation of the Game, in which he recounts several elderly men recalling having played as boys, covering a span from the 1790s to the 1830s; among others, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. recalled playing at Harvard, from which he graduated in 1829. =Cricket and rounders= That baseball is based on older English games such as stool-ball, trap-ball and tip-cat with possible influences from cricket is difficult to dispute. On the other hand, baseball as played in the New World has many elements that are uniquely American. The earliest published author to muse on the origin of baseball, John Montgomery Ward, was suspicious of the often-parroted claim that rounders is the direct ancestor of baseball, as both were formalized in the same time period. He concluded, with some amount of patriotism, that baseball evolved separately from town-ball (i.e. rounders), out of children's \\"safe haven\\" ball games. Games played with bat-and-ball together may all be distant cousins; the same goes for base-and-ball games. Bat, base, and ball games for two teams that alternate in and out, such as baseball, cricket, and rounders, are likely to be close cousins. They all involve throwing a ball to a batsman who attempts to \\"bat\\" it away and run safely to a base, while the opponent tries to put the batter-runner out when liable (\\"liable [to be put out]\\" is the baseball term for unsafe). Certainly, baseball is related to cricket and rounders, but exactly how, or how closely, has not been established. The only certain thing is that cricket is much older than baseball, and that cricket was very popular in colonial America and the early United States, fading only with the explosive popularity of New York baseball after the Civil War. Baseball owes to cricket some adopted terminology, such as \\"outs\\", \\"innings\\", \\"runs\\" and \\"umpires\\". There was also, \\"wicket\\", a countrified form of cricket once very popular in New England, which retained the old-fashioned wide, low two-stump wicket, and in which the large ball was rolled along the ground. The likelihood is that \\"base ball\\" and \\"rounders\\" (along with \\"feeder,\\" \\"squares\\" and other names) were regional appellations for the same boys' game played with varying rules in many parts of England from the early 1700s onward. Block, ibid. Along with its relatives stool-ball and the cat games it crossed the ocean with English colonists, and eventually followed its own independent evolutionary path, at the same time that back in England what was now generally called \\"rounders\\" was developing separately. =Cat, One old cat= The game of \\"cat\\" (or \\"cat-ball\\") had many variations but usually there was a pitcher, a catcher, a batter and fielders, but there were no sides (and often no bases to run). Often, as in English tip- cat, there was no pitcher and the \\"cat\\" was not a ball but an oblong wooden object, roughly football-shaped, which could be flipped into the air by striking one end, or simply a short stick which could be placed over a hole or stone and similarly flipped up. In other variants the batter himself tossed the ball into the air with his free hand, as in fungo. A feature of some versions of cat that would later become a feature of baseball was that a batter would be out if he swung and missed three times. Another game that was popular in early America was \\"one ol' cat\\", the name of which was possibly originally a contraction of one hole catapult. In one ol' cat, when a batter is put out, the catcher goes to bat, the pitcher catches, a fielder becomes the pitcher, and other fielders move up in rotation. One ol' cat was often played when there weren't enough players to choose up sides and play townball. Sometimes running to a base and back was involved. \\"Two ol' cat\\" was the same game as one ol' cat, except that there were two batters; a diagram preserved in the New York Public Library is labeled \\"Four Old Cat\\" and depicts a square field like a baseball diamond and four batters, one at each corner. =Bat and ball= There are numerous 18th and early 19th-century references in England and especially America to \\"bat and ball\\". Unfortunately,there is no knowledge and information about the game besides the name, nor whether it was an alternate term for baseball or something else such as trap-ball, cat or even cricket. It might merely be a generic phrase for any game played with bat and ball. However, in 1859, Alfred Elwyn recalled of his childhood in New Hampshire in the 1810s: This \\"bat and ball,\\" at least, appears very clearly to be a form of early baseball/roundball/townball. =Town ball, round ball, Massachusetts base ball= Ballgame in California, 1860s Baseball, as it was before the rise to dominance of its altered New York variant in the 1850s and 60s, was known variously as base ball, town ball, round ball, round town, goal ball, field-base, three-corner cat, the New England game, or Massachusetts baseball. Generally speaking, \\"round-ball\\" was the most usual name in New England, \\"base-ball\\" in New York, and \\"town-ball\\" in Pennsylvania and the South. A diagram posted in the baseball collection on the New York Public Library's Digital Gallery website identifies a game played, \\"Eight Boys with a ball & four bats playing [F]our Old Cat\\" This game was apparently played on a square of 40 feet on each side, but the diagram does not make clear the rules or how to play the game. The same sheet of paper shows a diagram of a square ‚Äì 60 feet per side with the base side having in its middle the \\"Home Goal\\", \\"Catcher\\", and \\"Striker\\", and with the corners marked as \\"1st Goal\\", \\"2nd Goal\\", \\"3rd Goal\\", and \\"4th Goal\\" as you travel counter-clockwise around the square. The note accompanying this diagram says, \\"Thirty or more players (15 or more on each side) with a bat and ball playing Town Ball, some times called Round Ball, and subsequently the so-called Massachusetts game of Base Ball\\". Early baseball or town-ball had many, many variants, as would be expected of an informal boys' game, and most differed in several particulars from the game which developed in New York in the 1840s. Besides usually (but not always) being played on a 'rectangle' rather than a 'diamond,' with the batter positioned between fourth and first base (there were also variants with three and five bases), it was played by various numbers of players from six to over thirty a side, in most but not all versions there was no foul territory and every batted ball was in play, innings were determined on the basis of either \\"all out/all out\\" as in cricket or \\"one out/all out\\", in many all out/all out versions there was an opportunity for the last batter to earn another inning by some prodigious feat of hitting, pitching was overhand (underhand pitching was mandatory in \\"New York\\" baseball until the 1880s), and, perhaps most significantly, a baserunner was put out by \\"soaking\\" or hitting him with a thrown ball, just as in French poison-ball and Gutsmuth's . Playing field diagram from the ‚ÄúRules and Regulations of the New Marlboro.‚Äô Match Base Ball Co.‚Äù As mentioned above, in 1829 The Boy's Own Book was reprinted in Boston, including the rules of rounders, and Robin Carver's 1834 The Book of Sports copied the same rules almost verbatim but changed \\"Rounders\\" to \\"Base or Goal ball\\" because, as the preface states, those \\"are the names generally adopted in this country\\" ‚Äì which also implies that the game was \\"generally\\" known and played. In 1833 the Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia was organized, and by 1837 the Gotham Base Ball Club would be formed in Manhattan, which would later split to form the Knickerbocker Club. 1835 saw the publication of Boy's Book of Sports which, confusingly, has chapters for both \\"Base ball\\" and \\"Base, or Goal-ball\\", which seem to be little if at all different; both were \\"all out, all out\\" townball with soaking and a three-strike rule. Of more interest is the fact that here appears the earliest use of the terms \\"innings\\" and \\"diamond\\". The early 1840s saw the formation of at least three more clubs in Manhattan, the New York, the Eagle and the Magnolia; another in Philadelphia, the Athletic; and even a club in Cincinnati. By 1851 the game of baseball was well-established enough that a newspaper report of a game played by a group of teamsters on Christmas Day referred to the game as \\"a good old-fashioned game of base ball\\", and the 1858 report of the National Association of Base Ball Players declared that \\"The game of base-ball has long been a favorite and popular recreation in this country, but it is only within the last fifteen years that any attempt has been made to systematize and regulate the game.\\" The older game was recognized as being very different in character from the new \\"Knickerbocker\\" style. The New York Clipper of October 10, 1857, reported on a match between the Liberty Club of New Jersey and \\"a party of Old Fogies who were in the habit of playing the old fashioned base ball, which as nearly everyone knows, is entirely different from the base ball as now played.\\" When, in 1860, the Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia voted to change over to the \\"New York game\\", several traditionalist members resigned in protest. That same year the rival Athletic Club traveled to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania for a challenge match in which they competed against the local club in both town ball (the home team prevailed 45‚Äì43), and \\"New York\\" baseball (Athletic won easily, 34‚Äì2). Round-ball persisted in New England longer than in other regions and during the period of overlap was sometimes distinguished as the \\"New England game\\" or \\"Massachusetts baseball\\"; in 1858 a set of rules was drawn up by the Massachusetts Association of Base Ball Players at Dedham. This game was played by teams of ten to fourteen players with four bases 60 feet apart and no foul territory. The ball was considerably smaller and lighter than a modern baseball, and runners were still put out by \\"soaking\\". Abner Doubleday myth Abner Doubleday The myth that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 was once widely promoted and widely believed. There is no evidence for this claim except for the testimony of one unreliable man decades later, and there is persuasive counter-evidence. Doubleday himself never made such a claim; he left many letters and papers, but they contain no description of baseball or any suggestion that he considered himself prominent in the game's history. His New York Times obituary makes no mention of baseball, nor does a 1911 Encyclop√¶dia article about Doubleday. The story was attacked by baseball writers almost as soon as it came out, but it had the weight of Major League Baseball and the Spalding publishing empire behind it. Contrary to popular belief, Doubleday was never inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although a large oil portrait of him was on display at the Hall of Fame building for many years. Doubleday's invention of baseball was the finding of a panel appointed by Albert Spalding, a former star pitcher and club executive, who had become the leading American sporting goods entrepreneur and sports publisher. Debate on baseball's origins had raged for decades, heating up in the first years of the 20th century, due in part to a 1903 essay baseball historian Henry Chadwick wrote in Spalding's Official Baseball Guide stating that baseball gradually evolved from English game of ‚Äúrounders‚Äù. To end argument, speculation, and innuendo, Spalding organized the Mills Commission in 1905. The members were baseball figures, not historians: Spalding's friend Abraham G. Mills, a former National League president; two United States Senators, former NL president Morgan Bulkeley and former Washington club president Arthur Gorman; former NL president and lifelong secretary-treasurer Nick Young; two other star players turned sporting goods entrepreneurs (George Wright and Alfred Reach); and AAU president James E. Sullivan. The final report, published on December 30, 1907, included three sections: a summary of the panel's findings written by Mills, a letter by John Montgomery Ward supporting the panel, and a dissenting opinion by Henry Chadwick. The research methods were, at best, dubious. Mills was a close friend of Doubleday, and upon Doubleday's death in 1893 Mills orchestrated his memorial service and burial. Doubleday had been a prominent member of the spiritualist Theosophical Society, in which Spalding's wife was deeply involved and in whose compound in San Diego Spalding was residing at the time. Wright and Reach were effectively Spalding's employees, as he had secretly bought out their sporting-goods businesses some years before. AAU president and Commission secretary Sullivan was Spalding's personal factotum. Several other members had personal reasons to declare baseball as an \\"American\\" game, such as Spalding's strong American imperialist views. The Commission found an appealing story: baseball was invented in a quaint rural town without foreigners or industry, by a young man who later graduated from West Point and served heroically in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Civil War, and U.S. wars against Indians. The Mills Commission concluded that Doubleday had invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York in 1839; that Doubleday had invented the word \\"baseball\\", designed the diamond, indicated fielders' positions, and written the rules. No written records in the decade between 1839 and 1849 have ever been found to corroborate these claims, nor could Doubleday be interviewed (he died in 1893). The principal source for the story was one letter from elderly Abner Graves, who was a five-year-old resident of Cooperstown in 1839. Graves never mentioned a diamond, positions or the writing of rules. What's more, his reliability as a witness was challenged because he spent his final days in an asylum for the criminally insane. Doubleday was not in Cooperstown in 1839 and may never have visited the town. He was enrolled at West Point at the time, and there is no record of any leave time. Mills, a lifelong friend of Doubleday, never heard him mention baseball, nor is there any mention of the game in Doubleday's autobiography. In character, Doubleday was bookish and sedentary, with no observable interest in athletics of any sort. Versions of baseball rules and descriptions of similar games have been found in publications that significantly predate his alleged invention in 1839. Despite this, the ballpark built in 1939 only a few blocks down from the Hall of Fame still bears the name \\"Doubleday Field\\". However, aside from the artificial intrusion of the person of Doubleday and the village of Cooperstown, the Mills report was not entirely incorrect in its broad outline: a game related to English rounders was played in America from early times; it was supplanted by a variant form which originated in New York circa 1840. But this development happened in urban New York City, not pastoral Cooperstown, and the men involved were neither farm boys nor West Point cadets. Knickerbocker rules Alexander Cartwright The earliest known published rules of baseball in the United States were written in 1845 for a New York City \\"base ball\\" club called the Knickerbockers. The purported organizer of the club, Alexander Cartwright, is one person commonly known as \\"the father of baseball\\". The rules themselves were written by the two-man Committee on By-Laws, Vice-President William R. Wheaton and Secretary William H. Tucker. One important rule, the 13th, outlawed \\"soaking\\" or \\"plugging\\", putting a runner out by hitting him with a thrown ball, introducing instead the concept of the tag; this reflected the use of a farther-traveling and potentially injurious hard ball. Another significant rule, the 15th, specified three outs to an inning for the first time instead of \\"one out, all out\\" or \\"all out, all out.\\" The 10th rule prescribed foul lines and foul balls and the 18th forbade runners advancing on a foul, unlike the \\"Massachusetts game\\" in which all batted balls were in play. The Knickerbockers also enlarged the diamond well beyond that of town ball, possibly to modern size depending on how \\"paces\\" is interpreted. Evolution from the so-called \\"Knickerbocker Rules\\" to the current rules is fairly well documented. The most significant differences were that overhand pitching was illegal, strikes were only counted if the batter swung and missed, \\"wides\\" or balls were not counted at all, a batted ball caught on the first bounce was an out, and a game was played to 21 \\"aces\\" or runs rather than for a set number of innings. It is noteworthy, however, that the Knickerbocker Rules did not cover a number of basic elements of the game. For example, there was no mention of positions or the number of players on a side, the pitching distance was unspecified, the direction of base-running was left open, and it was never stated, though implied, that an \\"ace\\" was scored by crossing home plate. In all likelihood, all of these matters except the first were considered so intrinsic to baseball by this time that they were assumed; the number of players on a side, however, remained a matter of debate among clubs until fixed at nine in 1857, the Knickerbockers arguing unsuccessfully for seven-man teams. On June 3, 1953, Congress officially credited Cartwright with inventing the modern game of baseball. He was already a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1938 for various other contributions to baseball. However, the role of Cartwright himself in the game's invention has been disputed. According to Major League Baseball's official historian, John Thorn, \\"Cartwright‚Äôs plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame declares he set the bases 90 feet apart and established nine innings as a game and nine players as a team. He did none of these things, and every other word of substance on his plaque is false.\\" His authorship may have been exaggerated in a modern attempt to identify a single inventor of the game, and heavily advanced by a relentless public-relations campaign by his grandson. The 1845 Rules themselves are signed by the \\"Committee on By-Laws\\", William R. Wheaton and William H. Tucker. There is evidence that these rules had been experimented with and used by New York ball clubs for some time; Cartwright, in his 1848 capacity as club secretary (and a bookseller), was merely the first to have them printed up. Ticket to the 1st annual ball of the (New York) Magnolia Ball Club, ca. 1843. This engraving, which precedes the Knickerbockers' founding by at least a year, is the earliest known image of grown men playing baseball. Further evidence of a more collective model of New York baseball's development, and doubts as to Cartwright's role as \\"inventor\\", came with the 2004 discovery of a newspaper interview with William R. Wheaton, a founding member of the Gotham Baseball Club in 1837 and first vice president of the Knickerbocker Club, and co-author of its rules, eight years later. If Wheaton's account, given in 1887, was correct, then most of the innovations credited to Cartwright were, in fact, the work of the Gothams before the Knickerbockers were formed, including a set of written rules. John Thorn, MLB's official historian, argued in his book Baseball in the Garden of Eden that four members of the Knickerbockers, namely Wheaton, Louis F. Wadsworth, Daniel \\"Doc\\" Adams and William H. Tucker, have stronger claims than Cartwright as \\"inventors\\" of modern baseball.Thorn, John, Baseball in the Garden of Eden: the Secret History of the Early Game. New York: Simon & Schuster 2011 Legend holds that Cartwright also introduced the game in most of the towns where he stopped on his trek west to California to find gold, a sort of Johnny Appleseed of baseball. This story, however, arose from forged entries in Cartwright's diary which were inserted after his death. It is however certain that Cartwright, a New York bookseller who later caught gold fever, umpired a game in Hoboken, New Jersey on June 19, 1846. The game ended, and the Knickerbockers' opponents (the New York nine) won, 23‚Äì1. This was long believed to be the first recorded U.S. baseball game between organized clubs. However, at least three earlier reported games have since been discovered: on October 10, 1845 a game was played between the New York Ball Club and an unnamed club from Brooklyn, at the Union Star Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn; the New Yorks lost 22 to 1. The game was reported in the New York Morning News and True Sun, making it the first ever published baseball result. The New Yorks and Brooklyns played two more games on October 21 and 24, with the first on the New Yorks' home diamond at Elysian Fields and the rematch at the Star Cricket Grounds again. One point undisputed by historians is that the modern professional major leagues that began in the 1870s developed directly from the amateur urban clubs of the 1840s and 1850s, not from the pastures of small towns such as Cooperstown. Elysian Fields Early baseball game played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph). In 1845, the Knickerbocker Club began using Elysian Fields in Hoboken to play baseball, following the New York and Magnolia Ball Clubs which had begun playing there in 1843. > At a preliminary meeting [of the Knickerbockers], it was suggested that as > it was apparent they would soon be driven from Murray Hill, some suitable > place should be obtained in New Jersey, where their stay could be permanent; > accordingly, a day or two afterwards, enough to make a game assembled at > Barclay street ferry, crossed over, marched up the road, prospecting for > ground on each side, until they reached the Elysian Fields, where they > \\"settled.\\"Peverelly, Charles, The Book of American Pastimes (New York: > Published by the Author, 1866), 340. On October 21, 1845 the New York Ball Club played the second of their three games against a Brooklyn team there, the series being the first known inter- club baseball games. In June 1846 the Knickerbockers played the \\"New York nine\\" (probably the same New York Ball Club) in the first baseball game played between clubs according to codified rules. A plaque and baseball diamond street pavings at 11th and Washington Streets commemorate the event. By the 1850s, several Manhattan-based members of the National Association of Base Ball Players were using the grounds as their home field. In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the Mutual Club of New York and the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the Currier & Ives lithograph The American National Game of Base Ball. With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in Brooklyn, enabling promoters there to charge admission to games; the prominence of Elysian Fields began to diminish. In 1868 the leading Manhattan club, Mutual, shifted its home games to the Union Grounds in Brooklyn. In 1880, the founders of the professional National League's New York club and the Metropolitan Club of the American Association finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan at the former Polo Grounds on 110th Street. After 1845 The Knickerbockers published their rulebook in 1848, including one significant change: the introduction of the force-out, but only at first base. In 1852, the Eagle Club published their rules, and two years later the Knickerbockers, Eagles and Gothams met and agreed to a uniform set of rules to govern all three clubs, at least in match play, which for the first time set the pitching distance (15 paces). A preliminary meeting in 1855 between seven other clubs, five from New York and one each from Brooklyn and New Jersey, represented the first effort to form an organized league, although it came to nothing. However, in 1857 sixteen clubs from New York and environs sent delegates to a convention that standardized the rules, essentially by agreeing to the unified Knickerbocker-Gotham-Eagle rules with certain revisions: rather than playing to a set number of runs, games would consist of nine innings, and force-outs could now occur at any base. The convention also defined the distance between the bases unambiguously as 90 feet, and specified nine-man teams. The following year, twenty-five clubs including one from New Jersey established an ongoing governing body with officers, constitution and by-laws, but the National Association of Base Ball Players is conventionally dated from the first meeting in 1857. It governed through 1870 but it scheduled and sanctioned no games. In 1858, clubs from the association played a cross-town, all-star series pitting Brooklyn clubs against clubs from New York and Hoboken. On July 20, 1858, an estimated crowd of about 4,000 spectators watched New York and Hoboken defeat Brooklyn by a score of 22‚Äì18. The New York team included players from the Union, Empire, Eagle, Knickerbocker and Gotham clubs. The Brooklyn team included players from the clubs Excelsior, Eckford, Atlantic and Putnam. This was the first baseball game played before a paying crowd, with tickets priced at ten cents; the surplus receipts after costs were donated to charity. In a return match held August 17, 1858, and played at the Fashion Course in the Corona neighborhood of Queens, a slightly smaller crowd cheered Brooklyn to a win over New York and Hoboken by a score of 29‚Äì8. New York won a third game in the series, also played at the Fashion Course, on September 10, 1858. By 1862 some NABBP member clubs offered games to the general public in enclosed ballparks with admission fees. During and after the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), the movements of soldiers and exchanges of prisoners helped spread the game. As of the December 1865 meeting, the year the war ended, there were isolated Association clubs in Fort Leavenworth, St. Louis, Louisville, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, along with about 90 member clubs north and east of Washington, D.C.. The game that was spread, however, was overwhelmingly the Knickerbocker version to the detriment of the older forms; as one periodical stated in 1865, All of these clubs were nominally amateur, although by the late 1860s the strongest clubs' best players were being paid under the table. For the 1869 season the NABBP, in an effort to take the corrupting money out of the amateur game, permitted the formation of professional teams. This move, however, backfired, as the pro game exploded in popularity and amateur club baseball quickly died out. By far the most successful of the new professional clubs, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, recruited nationally and effectively toured nationally, and no one beat them until June 1870. Their success led to the founding of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in 1871 and its successor, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs in 1876, the elder of baseball's two Major Leagues and the oldest professional sports league in the world. Already in the 19th century, the \\"old game\\" was invoked for special exhibitions such as reunions and anniversariesand for making moral points. Today hundreds of clubs in the U.S. play \\"vintage base ball\\" according to the 1845, 1858, or later rules (up to about 1887), usually in vintage uniforms. Some of them have supporting casts that recreate period dress and manner, especially those associated with living history museums. The origins of baseball were summarized in a documentary produced by Major League Baseball in 2009 titled Base Ball Discovered. =See also= * Palant References =Notes= =Bibliography=   Further reading External links *Block, David.

Taken by Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders while in lunar orbit, December 24, 1968 In astronomy, an extraterrestrial sky is a view of outer space from the surface of an astronomical body other than Earth. The only extraterrestrial sky that has been directly observed and photographed by astronauts is that of the Moon. The skies of Venus, Mars and Titan have been observed by space probes designed to land on the surface and transmit images back to Earth. Characteristics of extraterrestrial sky appear to vary substantially due to a number of factors. An extraterrestrial atmosphere, if present, has a large bearing on visible characteristics. The atmosphere's density and chemical composition can contribute to differences in colour, opacity (including haze) and the presence of clouds. Astronomical objects may also be visible and can include natural satellites, rings, star systems and nebulas and other planetary system bodies. Luminosity and angular diameter of the Sun The Sun's apparent magnitude changes according to the inverse square law, therefore, the difference in magnitude as a result of greater or lesser distances from different celestial bodies can be predicted by the following formula: : \\\\text{intensity} \\\\ \\\\propto \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{distance}^2} \\\\, Where \\"distance\\" can be in km, au, or any other appropriate unit. To illustrate, since Pluto is 40 au away from the Sun on average, it follows that the parent star would appear to be \\\\frac{1}{1600} times as bright as it is on Earth. Though a terrestrial observer would find a dramatic decrease in available sunlight in these environments, the Sun would still be bright enough to cast shadows even as far as the hypothetical Planet Nine, possibly located 1,200 AU away, and by analogy would still outshine the full Moon as seen from Earth. The change in angular diameter of the Sun with distance is illustrated in the diagram below: Diagram for the formula of the angular diameter The angular diameter of a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formulaThis can be derived using the formula for the length of a cord found at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html :\\\\delta = 2\\\\arctan \\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{2D}\\\\right), in which \\\\delta is the angular diameter, and d and D are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object. When D \\\\gg d, we have \\\\delta \\\\approx d / D, and the result obtained is in radians. For a spherical object whose actual diameter equals d_\\\\mathrm{act}, and where D is the distance to the centre of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the formula :\\\\delta = 2\\\\arcsin \\\\left(\\\\frac{d_\\\\mathrm{act}}{2D}\\\\right) The difference is due to the fact that the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the centre of the sphere. For practical use, the distinction is significant only for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the small-angle approximation holds for x \\\\ll 1: :\\\\arcsin x \\\\approx \\\\arctan x \\\\approx x . Horizon On terrestrial planets and other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects, the distance to the horizon for a \\"standard observer\\" varies as the square root of the planet's radius. Thus, the horizon on Mercury is 62% as far away from the observer as it is on Earth, on Mars the figure is 73%, on the Moon the figure is 52%, on Mimas the figure is 18%, and so on. The observer's height must be taken into account when calculating the distance to the horizon. Mercury Mercury ‚Äì sky viewed from orbit Because Mercury has little or no atmosphere, a view of the planet's skies would be no different from viewing space from orbit. Mercury has a southern pole star, Œ± Pictoris, a magnitude 3.2 star. It is fainter than Earth's Polaris (Œ± Ursae Minoris). Omicron Draconis is its north star.2004\\\\. Starry Night Pro, Version 5.8.4. Imaginova. . www.starrynight.com =Other planets seen from Mercury= After the Sun, the second-brightest object in the Mercurian sky is Venus, which is much brighter there than for terrestrial observers. The reason for this is that when Venus is closest to Earth, it is between the Earth and the Sun, so we see only its night side. Indeed, even when Venus is brightest in the Earth's sky, we are actually seeing only a narrow crescent. For a Mercurian observer, on the other hand, Venus is closest when it is in opposition to the Sun and is showing its full disk. The apparent magnitude of Venus is as bright as ‚àí7.7. The Earth and the Moon are also very prominent, their apparent magnitudes being about ‚àí5 and ‚àí1.2, respectively. The maximum apparent distance between the Earth and the Moon is about 15‚Ä≤. All other planets are visible just as they are on Earth, but somewhat less bright at opposition. The zodiacal light is probably more prominent than it is from Earth. Venus The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the Sun is not distinguishable in the daytime sky, and the stars are not visible at night. Being closer to the sun, Venus receives about 1.9 times more sunlight than earth, but due to the thick atmosphere, only about 20% of the light reaches the surface.Possible Venus twin discovered around dim starThe Planets: The Definitive Visual Guide to Our Solar System Color images taken by the Soviet Venera probes suggest that the sky on Venus is orange. If the Sun could be seen from Venus's surface, the time from one sunrise to the next (a solar day) would be 116.75 Earth days. Because of Venus's retrograde rotation, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east. An observer aloft in Venus's cloud tops, on the other hand, would circumnavigate the planet in about four Earth days and see a sky in which Earth and the Moon shine brightly (about magnitudes ‚àí6.6 and ‚àí2.7, respectively) at opposition. Mercury would also be easy to spot, because it is closer and brighter, at up to magnitude ‚àí2.7, and because its maximum elongation from the Sun is considerably larger (40.5¬∞) than when observed from Earth (28.3¬∞). 42 Draconis is the closest star to the north pole of Venus. Eta¬π Doradus is the closest to its south pole. (Note: The IAU uses the right- hand rule to define a positive pole for the purpose of determining orientation. Using this convention, Venus is tilted 177¬∞ (\\"upside down\\").) The Moon Earth from the Moon (composite; October 2015) The Moon's atmosphere is negligibly thin, essentially vacuum, so its sky is always black, as in the case of Mercury. However, the Sun is so bright that it is impossible to see stars during the daytime, unless the observer is well shielded from sunlight (direct or reflected from the ground). The Moon has a southern polar star, Œ¥ Doradus, a magnitude 4.34 star. It is better aligned than Earth's Polaris (Œ± Ursae Minoris), but much fainter. Its north pole star is currently Omicron Draconis.note: due to axial precession, the lunar pole describes a small circle on the celestial sphere every 18.6 years. =Eclipses from the Moon= From space, the Moon's shadow during the solar eclipse of March 9, 2016 appears as a dark spot moving across the Earth. Earth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times larger than that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. Earth's atmosphere would be visible as a reddish ring. During the Apollo 15 mission, an attempt was made to use the Lunar Roving Vehicle's TV camera to view such an eclipse, but the camera or its power source failed after the astronauts left for Earth. Terrestrial solar eclipses, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for lunar observers because the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would be barely visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object away. Lunar observers with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk. It would look essentially the same as it does to the Deep Space Climate Observatory. In summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line, or syzygy. Mars Mars has only a thin atmosphere; however, it is extremely dusty and there is much light that is scattered about. The sky is thus rather bright during the daytime and stars are not visible. The Martian northern pole star is Deneb; see review: , although the actual pole is somewhat offset in the direction of Alpha Cephei; it is more accurate to state that the top two stars of the Northern Cross, Sadr and Deneb, point to the north Celestial pole of Mars.http://www.eknent.com/etc/mars_np.png. Kappa Velorum is only a couple of degrees from the south Celestial pole of Mars. =The color of the Martian sky= Sunset (animated) ‚Äì Gale crater (April 15, 2015) Mars sky at noon, as imaged by Mars Pathfinder (June 1999) Mars sky at sunset, as imaged by Mars Pathfinder (June 1999) Spirit rover (May 2005) sunset, as imaged by the Curiosity rover (February 2013; Sun simulated by artist) Generating accurate true-color images from Mars's surface is surprisingly complicated. To give but one aspect to consider, there is the Purkinje effect: the human eye's response to color depends on the level of ambient light; red objects appear to darken faster than blue objects as the level of illumination goes down. There is much variation in the color of the sky as reproduced in published images, since many of those images have used filters to maximize their scientific value and are not trying to show true color. For many years, the sky on Mars was thought to be more pinkish than it is now believed to be. It is now known that during the Martian day, the sky is a butterscotch color. Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. This is the opposite of the situation on Earth. Twilight lasts a long time after the Sun has set and before it rises because of the dust high in Mars's atmosphere. On Mars, Rayleigh scattering is usually a very weak effect; the red color of the sky is caused by the presence of iron(III) oxide in the airborne dust particles. These particles are larger in size than gas molecules, so most of the light is scattered by Mie scattering. Dust absorbs blue light and scatters longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow). =The Sun from Mars= The Sun as seen from Mars appears to be the angular diameter as seen from Earth (0.35¬∞), and sends 40% of the light, approximately the brightness of a slightly cloudy afternoon on Earth. On June 3, 2014, the Curiosity rover on Mars observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth. =Earth from Mars= The Earth is visible from Mars as a double star; the Moon would be visible alongside it as a fainter companion. The maximum visible distance between the Earth and the Moon would be about 25‚Ä≤, at inferior conjunction of the Earth and the Sun (for the terrestrial observer, this is the opposition of Mars and the Sun). Near maximum elongation (47.4¬∞), the Earth and Moon would shine at apparent magnitudes ‚àí2.5 and +0.9, respectively. (JPL Horizons shows: 0.9304AU from Earth; Phase 43%; Sun Elongation 43¬∞) =Venus from Mars= Venus as seen from Mars (when near the maximum elongation from the Sun of 31.7¬∞) would have an apparent magnitude of about ‚àí3.2. Jupiter Although no images from within Jupiter's atmosphere have ever been taken, artistic representations typically assume that the planet's sky is blue, though dimmer than Earth's, because the sunlight there is on average 27 times fainter, at least in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The planet's narrow rings might be faintly visible from latitudes above the equator. Further down into the atmosphere, the Sun would be obscured by clouds and haze of various colors, most commonly blue, brown, and red. Although theories abound on the cause of the colors, there is currently no unambiguous answer. From Jupiter, the Sun appears to cover only 5 arcminutes, less than a quarter of its size as seen from Earth. The north pole of Jupiter is a little over two degrees away from Zeta Draconis, while its south pole is about two degrees north of Delta Doradus. =Jupiter's moons as seen from Jupiter= Aside from the Sun, the most prominent objects in Jupiter's sky are the four Galilean moons. Io, the nearest to the planet, would be slightly larger than the full moon in Earth's sky, though less bright, and would be the largest moon in the Solar System as seen from its parent planet. The higher albedo of Europa would not overcome its greater distance from Jupiter, so it would not outshine Io. In fact, the low solar constant at Jupiter's distance (3.7% Earth's) ensures that none of the Galilean satellites would be as bright as the full moon is on Earth, and neither would any other moon in the Solar System. Water vapor plume on Europa (artist concept; December 12, 2013) All four Galilean moons stand out because of the swiftness of their motion, compared to the Moon. They are all also large enough to fully eclipse the Sun. Because Jupiter's axial tilt is minimal, and the Galilean moons all orbit in the plane of Jupiter's equator, solar eclipses are quite common. =The skies of Jupiter's moons= None of Jupiter's moons have more than traces of atmosphere, so their skies are very nearly black. For an observer on one of the moons, the most prominent feature of the sky by far would be Jupiter. For an observer on Io, the closest large moon to the planet, Jupiter's apparent diameter would be about 20¬∞ (38 times the visible diameter of the Moon, covering 5% of Io's sky). An observer on Metis, the innermost moon, would see Jupiter's apparent diameter increased to 68¬∞ (130 times the visible diameter of the Moon, covering 18% of Metis's sky). A \\"full Jupiter\\" over Metis shines with about 4% of the Sun's brightness (light on Earth from a full moon is 400 thousand times dimmer than sunlight). Because the inner moons of Jupiter are in synchronous rotation around Jupiter, the planet always appears in nearly the same spot in their skies (Jupiter would wiggle a bit because of the non- zero eccentricities). Observers on the sides of the Galilean satellites facing away from the planet would never see Jupiter, for instance. From the moons of Jupiter, solar eclipses caused by the Galilean satellites would be spectacular, because an observer would see the circular shadow of the eclipsing moon travel across Jupiter's face. Saturn Cassini spacecraft photographs the Earth and Moon (bottom-right) from Saturn (July 19, 2013) The sky in the upper reaches of Saturn's atmosphere is blue (from imagery of the Cassini mission at the time of its September 2017 demise), but the predominant color of its cloud decks suggests that it may be yellowish further down. Observations from spacecraft show that seasonal smog develops in Saturn's southern hemisphere at its perihelion due to its axial tilt. This could cause the sky to become yellowish at times. As the northern hemisphere is pointed towards the sun only at aphelion, the sky there would likely remain blue. The rings of Saturn are almost certainly visible from the upper reaches of its atmosphere. The rings are so thin that from a position on Saturn's equator, they would be almost invisible. However, from anywhere else on the planet, they could be seen as a spectacular arc stretching across half the celestial hemisphere. Delta Octantis is the south pole star of Saturn. Its north pole is in the far northern region of Cepheus, about six degrees from Polaris. =The sky of Titan= Huygens probe Titan is the only moon in the Solar System to have a thick atmosphere. Images from the Huygens probe show that the Titanean sky is a light tangerine color. However, an astronaut standing on the surface of Titan would see a hazy brownish/dark orange color. As a consequence of its greater distance from the Sun and the opacity of its atmosphere, the surface of Titan receives only about of the sunlight Earth does ‚Äì daytime on Titan is thus only as bright as twilight on the Earth. It seems likely that Saturn is permanently invisible behind orange smog, and even the Sun would be only a lighter patch in the haze, barely illuminating the surface of ice and methane lakes. However, in the upper atmosphere, the sky would have a blue color and Saturn would be visible. With its thick atmosphere and methane rain, Titan is the only celestial body other than Earth upon which rainbows on the surface could form. However, given the extreme opacity of the atmosphere in visible light, the vast majority would be in the infrared. Uranus Judging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of Uranus is probably a light blue, i.e. cyan color. It is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark. Uranus has a northern polar star, Sabik (Œ∑ Ophiuchi), a magnitude 2.4 star. Uranus also has a southern polar star, 15 Orionis, an unremarkable magnitude 4.8 star. Both are fainter than Earth's Polaris (Œ± Ursae Minoris), although Sabik only slightly. Neptune Triton in the sky of Neptune (simulated view) The north pole of Neptune points to a spot midway between Gamma and Delta Cygni. Its south pole star is Gamma Velorum. Judging by the color of its atmosphere, the sky of Neptune is probably an azure or sky blue, similar to Uranus's. As in the case of Uranus, it is unlikely that the planet's rings can be seen from its surface, as they are very thin and dark. Aside from the Sun, the most notable object in Neptune's sky is its large moon Triton, which would appear slightly smaller than a full Moon on Earth. It moves more swiftly than our Moon, because of its shorter period (5.8 days) compounded by its retrograde orbit. The smaller moon Proteus would show a disk about half the size of the full Moon. Surprisingly, Neptune's small inner moons all cover, at some point in their orbits, more than 10‚Ä≤ in Neptune's sky. At some points, Despina's angular diameter rivals that of Ariel from Uranus and Ganymede from Jupiter. Here are the angular diameters for Neptune's moons (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31‚Ä≤ for terrestrial observers): Naiad, 7‚Äì13‚Ä≤; Thalassa, 8‚Äì14‚Ä≤; Despina, 14‚Äì22‚Ä≤; Galatea, 13‚Äì18‚Ä≤; Larissa, 10‚Äì14‚Ä≤; Proteus, 12‚Äì16‚Ä≤; Triton, 26‚Äì28‚Ä≤. An alignment of the inner moons would likely produce a spectacular sight. Neptune's large outer satellite, Nereid, is not large enough to appear as a disk from Neptune, and is not noticeable in the sky, as its brightness at full phase varies from magnitude 2.2‚Äì6.4, depending on which point in its eccentric orbit it happens to be. The other irregular outer moons would not be visible to the naked eye, although a dedicated telescopic observer could potentially spot some at full phase. As with Uranus, the low light levels cause the major moons to appear very dim. The brightness of Triton at full phase is only ‚àí7.11, despite the fact that Triton is more than four times as intrinsically bright as Earth's moon and orbits much closer to Neptune. =The sky of Triton= Neptune in the sky of Triton (simulated view) Triton, Neptune's largest moon, has an atmosphere, but it is so thin that its sky is still black, possibly with some pale haze at the horizon. Because Triton orbits with synchronous rotation, Neptune always appears in the same position in its sky. Triton's rotation axis is inclined 130¬∞ to Neptune's orbital plane and thus points within 40¬∞ of the Sun twice per Neptunian year, much like Uranus's. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun for 82 years at a stretch, resulting in radical seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Neptune itself would span 8 degrees in Triton's sky, though with a maximum brightness roughly comparable to that of the full moon on Earth it would appear only about as bright as the full moon, per unit area. Due to its eccentric orbit, Nereid would vary considerably in brightness, from fifth to first magnitude; its disk would be far too small to see with the naked eye. Proteus would also be difficult to resolve at just 5‚Äì6 arcminutes across, but it would never be fainter than first magnitude, and at its closest would rival Canopus. Trans- Neptunian Objects A trans-Neptunian object is any minor planet in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance (semi-major axis) than Neptune, 30 astronomical units (AU). =Pluto and Charon= Pluto, accompanied by its largest moon Charon, orbits the Sun at a distance usually outside the orbit of Neptune except for a twenty-year period in each orbit. From Pluto, the Sun is point-like to human eyes, but still very bright, giving roughly 150 to 450 times the light of the full Moon from Earth (the variability being due to the fact that Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, stretching from just 4.4 billion km to over 7.3 billion km from the Sun). Nonetheless, human observers would find a large decrease in available light: the solar illuminance at Pluto‚Äôs average distance is about 85 lx, which is equivalent to an office building hallway‚Äôs illuminance or a toilet‚Äôs lighting. Pluto's atmosphere consists of a thin envelope of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide gases, all of which are derived from the ices of these substances on its surface. When Pluto is close to the Sun, the temperature of Pluto's solid surface increases, causing these ices to sublimate into gases. This atmosphere also produces a noticeable blue haze that is visible at sunset and possibly other times of the Plutonian day. Pluto and Charon are tidally locked to each other. This means that Charon always presents the same face to Pluto, and Pluto also always presents the same face to Charon. Observers on the far side of Charon from Pluto would never see the dwarf planet; observers on the far side of Pluto from Charon would never see the moon. Every 124 years, for several years it is mutual-eclipse season, during which Pluto and Charon each alternatively eclipse the Sun for the other at intervals of 3.2 days. Charon, as seen from Pluto's surface at the sub-Charon point, has an angular diameter of about 3.8¬∞, nearly eight times the Moon's angular diameter as seen from Earth and about 56 times the area. It would be a very large object in the night sky, shining about 8%Charon's radius is 606 km to the Moon's 1737 (surface ratio 0.12), its albedo is 0.35 to the Moon's 0.14 (2.6 ratio), its semi-major axis is 19591 km to the Moon's 384,400 (385 ratio of illumination), and the Sun is 39.482 times farther (0.00064 ratio of solar illumination). Multiplying these together yields an illuminance 0.077 times the Moon's. as bright as the Moon (it would appear darker than the Moon because its lesser illumination comes from a larger disc). Charon‚Äôs illuminance would be about 14 mlx (for comparison, a moonless clear night sky is 2 mlx while a full Moon is between 300 and 50 mlx). File:Plutonian system.jpgView from Hydra.

Extrasolar planets =Basics= For observers on extrasolar planets, the constellations would differ depending on the distances involved. The view of outer space of exoplanets can be extrapolated from open source software such as Celestia or Stellarium, and it appears that due to parallax, distant stars change their position less than nearby ones. For alien observers, the Sun would be visible to the naked human eye only at distances below 20 ‚Äì 27 parsec (60‚Äì90 ly).These numbers are extrapolated from the fact that the human eye can generally see up to magnitude 6.5 on Earth, while it can see up to magnitude 7 under the best possible conditions. If the Sun were to be observed from another star, it would always appear on the opposite coordinates in the sky. Thus an observer located near a star with RA at 4 hr and declination ‚àí10 would see the Sun located at RA: 16 hr, dec: +10. A consequence of observing the universe from other stars is that stars that may appear bright in our own sky may appear dimmer in other skies and vice versa. =Recent developments= In May 2017, glints of light from Earth, seen as twinkling by DSCOVR, a satellite stationed roughly a million miles from earth at the earth-sun L1 Lagrange point, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. The technology used to determine this may be useful in studying the atmospheres of distant worlds, including those of exoplanets. From the Large Magellanic Cloud From a viewpoint in the LMC, the Milky Way's total apparent magnitude would be ‚àí2.0‚Äîover 14 times brighter than the LMC appears to us on Earth‚Äîand it would span about 36¬∞ across the sky, the width of over 70 full moons. Furthermore, because of the LMC's high galactic latitude, an observer there would get an oblique view of the entire galaxy, free from the interference of interstellar dust that makes studying in the Milky Way's plane difficult from Earth.Some of the figures in the \\"View\\" section were extrapolated from data in the Appendix of Chaisson and McMillan's Astronomy Today (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1993). The Small Magellanic Cloud would be about magnitude 0.6, substantially brighter than the LMC appears to us.

Snorri Sturluson relates in his Ynglinga saga that King Ingvar, √ñsten's son, was a great warrior who often spent time patrolling the shores of his kingdom fighting Danes and Estonian vikings (V√≠kingr fr√° Esthland). King Ingvar finally came to a peace agreement with the Danes and could take care of the Estonian vikings. He consequently started pillaging in Estonia in retribution, and one summer he arrived at a place called Stein (see also Sveigder). The Estonians (s√Ωslu kind) assembled a great army in the interior and attacked King Ingvar in a great battle. The Estonian forces were too powerful and Ingvar fell and the Swedish forces retreated. Ingvar was buried in a mound at a place called Stone or Hill fort (at Steini) on the shores of Estonia (A√∞als√Ωsla).

By its peak in 1920, Ireland had 3,500 route miles (4,200 km). The current status is less than half that amount, with a large unserviced area around the border area between Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland. Railways on the island of Ireland are run by Iarnr√≥d √âireann (Irish Rail) within Ireland and Northern Ireland Railways within Northern Ireland. The two companies jointly operate the island's only cross-border service, the Enterprise, between Dublin and Belfast. The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland based in Whitehead, County Antrim runs preserved steam trains on the main line, with the Irish Traction Group preserving diesel locomotives, and operating on the main line. The Downpatrick & County Down Railway is the only self-contained full-size heritage railway in the island of Ireland. Transport before railways Transport on a country-wide scale began in 1710 with the introduction by the General Post Office of mail coaches on the main routes between towns. Private operators added to the routes, and an established \\"turnpike\\" road system started in the 1730s. In 1715 the Irish Parliament took steps to encourage inland navigation, but it was not until 1779 that the first 19 km (12 mi) section of the Grand Canal was opened. The addition of the Royal Canal and river navigation (particularly on the River Shannon) meant that freight could be transported more easily. Charles Bianconi established his horse-car services in the south in 1815, the first of many such passenger-carrying operations. Despite these improvements huge areas of Ireland still relied on a basic road system; turnpikes were still slow and canals were expensive. Ireland's first railway The Dublin and Kingstown line in 1837. Dublin and Kingstown Railway, by John Harris. Although a railway between Limerick and Waterford had been authorised as early as 1826 (the same year as Britain's first exclusively locomotive-drawn line, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway) it was not until 1834 that the first railway was built, the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR;) between Westland Row in Dublin and Kingstown (D√∫n Laoghaire), a distance of 10 km (6 mi). Due to local opposition the first terminus, Kingstown Harbour, was adjacent to the West Pier. It took a further three years before the line reached the site of the present station. The contractor was William Dargan, called \\"the founder of railways in Ireland\\", due to his participation in many of the main routes. The D&KR; was notable in being the earliest dedicated commuter railway in the world. The planning undertaken was also noteworthy: a full survey of the existing road traffic was made, in addition to careful land surveys. As well as the traffic survey showing existing volumes to be healthy, there was the potential from the ever-expanding port at Kingstown. On 9 October 1834 the locomotive Hibernia brought a train the full route from the Westland Row terminus (now Dublin Pearse) to Kingstown. The railway was built to . The entire route forms part of the present day Dublin Area Rapid Transit electrified commuter rail system. Railway gauges The state of the rail network in the island of Ireland in 1906. The track gauge adopted by the mainline railways is . This unusual gauge is otherwise found only in the Australian states of Victoria, southern New South Wales (as part of the Victorian rail network) and South Australia (where it was introduced by the Irish railway engineer F. W. Sheilds), and in Brazil. The first three railways all had different gauges: the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, ; the Ulster Railway, ; and the Dublin and Drogheda Railway, . Following complaints from the Ulster Railway, the Board of Trade investigated the matter, and in 1843 recommended the use of and that compensation be paid to the Ulster Railway for the costs incurred in changing to the new gauge. Main line railways By the beginning of the 20th century, the main line railways were: =Belfast and County Down Railway= The Belfast and County Down Railway (B&CDR;) linked Belfast south-eastwards into County Down. It was incorporated in 1846; the first section opened in 1848; absorbed into the Ulster Transport Authority in 1948 and all but the line to Bangor closed in 1950. =Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway= The Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway (CB&SCR;) was one of the major Irish railways; incorporated 1845, the first section opened 1851. It operated from Cork, serving towns along the southern coastal strip to the west of the city. It had a route length of 150 km (93.75 mi), all single line. The Railway was largely concerned with tourist traffic, and there were many road car routes connecting with the line, including one from Bantry to Killarney called The Prince of Wales Route, which operated at the beginning of the 20th century. The Clonakilty Extension Railway 14 km (8.75 mi), opened 1886, was worked by the CB&SCR; =County Donegal Railways Joint Committee= The County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC) operated in north-west Ireland during the 20th century. The parent line opened 1863, 178 km (111 mi) (narrow gauge). It was incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1906 which authorised the joint purchase of the then Donegal Railway Company by the Great Northern Railway of Ireland and the Midland Railway Northern Counties Committee. The Strabane and Letterkenny Railway 31 km (19.5 mi), opened 1909, was worked by the CDRJC =Dublin and South Eastern Railway= The Dublin and South Eastern Railway (D&SER;) was originally incorporated, by Act of Parliament in 1846, as the Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow and Dublin Railway Company; incorporated 1846, the first section opened 1856. It was known more simply as the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company between 1860 and 31 December 1906 when it became the DSE. Amongst the lines forming the DSE were: *The Dublin and Kingstown Railway authorised 1831, it opened in 1834 ‚Äì the first public railway in Ireland. The Kingstown-Dalkey section was operated by atmospheric traction for a short while. The railway formed part of the Royal Mail route between London and Dublin via the packet station at Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire). *The City of Dublin Junction Railway 2 km (1.25 mi), opened 1 May 1891, the Dublin and Kingstown Railway 10 km (6 mi); opened 1834, and the New Ross and Waterford Extension Railway 22 km (13.5 mi); opened 1904 were all worked by the D&SER.; =Great Northern Railway of Ireland= The coat of arms of the GNR. The route of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland (GNR(I)), which exists today from Dublin to Belfast and Drogheda to Navan, emerged, like so many others of the former major railway companies in Ireland, as the result of many amalgamations with smaller lines. The earliest dates of incorporation were for: * the Ulster Railway, the second railway project to start in Ireland, incorporated May 1836, partially opened 1839; it was originally constructed to a gauge of , but was later altered, under protest, to the new . The companies forming the Dublin to Belfast line and those connecting to it were obliged to contribute part of this cost. * the Dublin and Drogheda Railway (D&D;), also incorporated 1839, opened in 1844. * the Irish North Western Railway (INWR), incorporated in 1862 in a merger between the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway and the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway, operated from Dundalk and Portadown via Enniskillen and Omagh to Derry. * the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway (D&BJct;), incorporated in 1845 and opened in stages between 1849 and 1853. In 1875, the D&D; and the D&BJct; merged to form the Northern Railway of Ireland and thirteen months later the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (GNR(I)) was formed when the Ulster Railway and the INWR joined this concern. Other minor railways were subsequently taken over. At its height, in the thirty or so years prior to World War I, the GNR(I) covered a large area of Ireland between Dublin, Belfast, Derry and Bundoran. By the end of World War II the company was in dire straits. It struggled on until 1953 when it was nationalised by the two Governments, becoming the Great Northern Railway Board. In 1957, the Government of Northern Ireland unilaterally ordered the GNRB to close most of their lines west of the River Bann within Northern Ireland. This left some useless stubs within the Republic, such as through Pettigo station; 13 km (8 mi) from the border to Bundoran and Monaghan to Glaslough. The Irish Government had no choice but to abandon these stubs. The one exception, which survived until 1965, was the line from Portadown to Derry via Dungannon and Omagh. The GNRB was abolished on 1 October 1958, when it was split between the Ulster Transport Authority and C√≥ras Iompair √âireann in Northern Ireland and the Republic, respectively. This gave rise to the interesting situation whereby part of the line between Strabane and Derry was in the Republic of Ireland and the stations and permanent way staff on this section were CI√â employees, even though there was no physical link to the rest of the CI√â rail network. The Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh Railway 29 km (18.25 mi), opened in 1909 was worked by the GNR(I) =Great Southern & Western Railway= Still known today as the 'premier line', the Great Southern & Western Railway (GS&WR;) was the largest railway system in Ireland. It began as a railway incorporated to connect Dublin with Cashel ‚Äì incorporated 6 August 1844 ‚Äì and which was afterwards extended to the city of Cork. Various other amalgamations took place until the end of the 19th century, among them lines to Limerick and Waterford. In 1900, as a result of Acts of Parliament, several important lines became part of the GS&WR; system, including the Waterford & Central Ireland Railway and the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway. The latter connected Sligo to Limerick. The Railway also connected with the Midland Great Western Railway main line at Athlone on its Dublin‚ÄìGalway main line. The Athenry and Tuam Extension Light Railway 27 km (17 mi), Baltimore Extension Light Railway 13 km (8 mi), Tralee and Fenit Railway 13 km (8 mi); opened 1887 and Waterford, New Ross and Wexford Junction Railway 5 km (3.25 mi) (leased from D&SER;) were worked by the Great Southern & Western Railway. =Midland Great Western Railway= The Midland Great Western Railway main line connected Dublin to Galway and Clifden via (Athlone); there were a number of branch lines: * Kingscourt via Navan, * Nesbitt Junction (near Enfield) to Edenderry, * Sligo, with further branches to Cavan Town and Ballaghaderreen, * Westport with further branches to Achill, Ballinrobe and Killala via Ballina in County Mayo, * Attymon Junction to Loughrea. The Railway was first incorporated in 1845. Both the Ballinrobe and Claremorris Railway 19 km (12 mi), opened 1892 and the Loughrea and Attymon Light Railway 14 km (9 mi), opened 1890 were worked by the Midland Great Western. =Northern Counties Committee= The Northern Counties Committee (Midland Railway) was an amalgamation of the Midland Railway with the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway which was formed on 1 July 1903. Additionally, the Carrickfergus Harbour Junction Light Railway 2 km (1 mi); was incorporated in 1882, opening in 1887 and was worked by the Northern Counties Committee. Other railways =Independent railways= *Ballycastle Railway 26 km (16.25 mi) ( gauge); incorporated 1878, opened 1880; four locomotives, 74 other vehicles *Bessbrook and Newry Tramway (electric) 3 miles (5 km) ( gauge); incorporated 1884; one locomotive, 24 other vehicles *Castlederg and Victoria Bridge Tramway 12 km (7.25 mi); ( gauge); incorporated 1883, opened 1884; three locomotives, 34 other vehicles; closed 1933 *Cavan and Leitrim Light Railway 78 km (48.5 mi); ( gauge); incorporated 1883, opened 1888; nine locomotives, 167 other vehicles *Cavehill and Whitewell Tramway 6 km (3.75 mi) *Clogher Valley Railway 59 km (37 mi)( gauge); incorporated 1884, opened 1887; seven locomotives, 127 other vehicles; closed 1942 *Clonakilty Extension Light Railway 14 km (8.75 mi); ( gauge); incorporated 1881, opened 1886 *Cork and Macroom Direct Railway 38 km (24.5 mi); incorporated 1861, opened 1866; four locomotives, 132 other vehicles *Cork and Muskerry Light Railway (C&MLR;) 29 km (18 mi); ( gauge); incorporated 1883, opened 1887; six locomotives, 87 other vehicles ** Donoughmore Extension Railway 14 km (9 mi) (worked by C&MLR;) incorporated 1900 *Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway 26 km (16 mi); (originally Irish gauge, gauge; converted to gauge in 1900); incorporated 1846, opened 1850; four locomotives, 57 other vehicles *Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway 25 km (15.5 mi); ( gauge); incorporated 1887, opened 1888; four locomotives, 46 other vehicles *Dublin and Lucan Electric Railway 1900‚Äì1925, 11 km (7 mi); ( gauge), 37 vehicles.

The line closed, under CI√â, in 1960 *West Clare Railway 43 km (27 mi); ( gauge); opened 1887; eight locomotives, 146 other vehicles ::The information contained in this section obtained from Railway Year Book 1912 (Railway Publishing Company) =Monorail= Ballybunion, c. 1902 The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway was opened in 1888. It was the world's first commercial monorail, named the Lartigue system after Charles Lartigue. It operated between Listowel and Ballybunion in County Kerry until 1924. A modern-day re-creation of this system operates in Listowel.Lartigue Railway Photographs 2004 The system in the early 20th century The rail system, both North and South, survived independence unscathed. The Irish Civil War was to take a much heavier toll on the railways in the newly born Irish Free State (Saorst√°t √âireann), as the Anti-Treaty IRA systematically targeted them and the Free State had to build a network of fortified blockhouses to protect the railways. One of the most spectacular attacks on the infrastructure was the bombing of the Mallow viaduct. (See The Civil War and the Railways) In 1925, the railway companies within Saorst√°t √âireann were merged to form the Great Southern Railways. This company was amalgamated on 1 January 1945 with the Dublin United Transport Company to form C√≥ras Iompair √âireann. Partition however, would eventually exact a heavy toll on the cross‚Äìborder routes (intrinsic to the County Donegal rail network). World War II also proved costly for the rail system in the Republic. With the war effort, Britain could not spare coal for neutral Ireland. Thus, Irish steam engines often ran on poor quality Irish coal, wood, or not at all. Unsuccessful attempts were even made to burn peat. The deteriorating quality and frequency of service discouraged rail travellers, whose numbers were also diminishing due to steadily increasing emigration. =Dieselisation= Railways in the Republic were converted to diesel locomotive traction early, and swiftly, due to the run down nature of many of the steam engines, lack of coal, and a desire for modernisation. In 1951 CI√â's first diesel railcars arrived, followed in 1953 by an order for 100 diesel locomotives. =Rationalisation= Disused railway viaduct at Lispole, County Kerry on the Dingle-Tralee line In the 1950s and 1960s, many lines were closed (a maximum of in the Republic and in Northern Ireland was reached in 1920, declining to and respectively in 1950 and and by 1957)Railway Magazine May 1958 p.321 but evidence is still visible in the landscape, as are more significant features like bridges and viaducts. The entire West Cork Railway network closed, as were most branch lines in the Republic. The main route network survived intact, with a relatively even distribution of cutbacks. The main routes from Dublin to Belfast, Sligo, Galway and the West of Ireland, Limerick, Cork and Kerry, Waterford and Wexford survived. The cross country route from Rosslare to Limerick and onwards to Sligo survived for a time, although services would later cease on almost all the routes. The North Kerry line from Limerick to Tralee survived until the 1970s. One notable closure was that of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Harcourt Street railway line in Dublin, despite being regarded as an important commuter artery. On 30 June 2004, the majority of the route reopened as part of the new Luas tram system. South of the Sandyford depot, decisions taken by CI√â and D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council, to sell the trackbed through Foxrock and allow houses to be built on it near Shankill respectively have made integrating this route into the Luas system difficult. After Sandyford the line detours over the Leopardstown roundabout so as to run west around the Leopardstown Racecourse before rejoining the original alignment just north of Carrickmines. The Harcourt Street line had run around the eastern edge of the racecourse, via Silverpark. Remnants of the old Foxrock Station are visible at the back of The Hedgerows in Foxrock. After this detour around Leopardstown Racecourse, the current line runs roughly along the original alignment with some minor detours, particularly prevalent at Laughanstown. The Luas Green Line currently terminates at Bride's Glen, just north of the viaduct of the same name. It has been proposed to restore the viaduct should it carry the proposed Luas extension to Bray. In a few years, the Ulster Transport Authority shut down a large network across Ulster, leaving only Belfast to Derry, Dublin and branches to Larne and Bangor. CI√â, the transport company in the Republic, had no option but to close their end of cross-border routes. Today a large hole remains in the island's rail network, with a distance of 210 km (130 mi) from Derry to Mullingar untouched by railways, and no rail service to large towns such as Letterkenny and Monaghan. =1970s and 1980s= In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a long period without substantial investment in the rail system, with the notable exception of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART), in which the North-South commuter route in and out of Dublin was electrified, and new frequent services have run from July 1984 to the present day. It was intended to expand the service, with routes to the West of the city, but economic conditions militated against this. In fact, the size of the DART fleet remained unaltered until the year 2000. Also, 1976 saw the introduction of a small fleet of 18 high-speed diesel-electric locomotives built by General Motors Electro-Motive Diesel at La Grange, Illinois. These units, 071 Class, were capable of speeds of 145 km/h (90 mph) and immediately began operating express services such as the Cork-Dublin line. A major disaster occurred on 1 August 1980, when 18 people were killed and 62 injured in a rail accident in Buttevant on the main Cork-Dublin line. A train carrying 230 passengers was derailed when it crashed into a siding at 110 km/h (70 mph). The passengers who were most severely injured or killed were seated in coaches with wooden frames. This structure was incapable of surviving a high speed crash and did not come near to the safety standards provided by modern (post 1950s) metal bodied coaches. This accident led to a major review of the national rail safety policy and resulted in the rapid elimination of the wooden-bodied coaches that had formed part of the train. The decision to purchase a new fleet of modern InterCity carriages based on the British Rail Mark 3 design was quickly made. These coaches, an already well proven design, were built by BREL in Derby, England and, under licence, at CI√â's own workshops at Inchicore in Dublin between 1980 and 1989. Other carriages to join the fleet in the 1980s were second-hand ex British Rail Mark 2s. Cutbacks continued in this period: in 1975 the last rural branch line between Attymon Junction and Loughrea was closed, the line between Limerick and Claremorris and a number of local stations on main lines (such as Buttevant) lost their passenger services. Freight closures at the end of the 1980s included the closure of the line to Youghal in County Cork and the removal of the North Kerry line. =1990s rail revival= In the 1990s, the Republic experienced an economic boom (known colloquially as the Celtic Tiger). This allowed substantial investment to be made. 34 new locomotives (designated 201 Class) were purchased from General Motors, including two for Northern Ireland Railways (NIR). New De Dietrich carriages were also purchased for the cross- border 'Enterprise' service. Meanwhile, the route network was upgraded to continuous welded rail (CWR) and old mechanical signalling was replaced by electronic signalling. In the mid-1990s, the Greater Dublin area continued to experience a population boom. Such commuter trains as existed were ageing slam-door stock on unreliable old locomotives (the better stock was for InterCity use). The DART was limited in terms of capacity and route. New diesel railcars were ordered, and added first to the Kildare suburban route. The route from Clonsilla to Maynooth was double-tracked and further diesel railcars ordered, and the reopening of stations such as Drumcondra. Again, the North-South Dublin route saw new railcars provide services to Dundalk and Arklow. A number of orders were made for new DART carriages, the first for over a decade. =2000s = The line was electrified and DART services extended in the South East to Greystones in 2000 and on to Malahide on the Northern line. DART and Commuter stations were also upgraded, allowing access for people with disabilities with new lifts at footbridges and lengthened platforms to accommodate 8-car sets. Extra roads were provided out of Dublin, while the main terminals of Dublin Connolly and Dublin Heuston were upgraded (the latter completed in 2004, doubling its previous capacity). A new railcar servicing depot was built at Drogheda in 2004 (Inchicore continues to be used for locomotives and carriages). Iarnr√≥d √âireann placed orders for 67 InterCity carriages in 2003 and for 150 \\"regional railcars\\" (diesel multiple unit) in 2004. These were used to meet the demand on the railways, and all older carriages were retired from revenue service by September 2009. At peak times, capacity was below requirements. It has been seen in recent years that Iarnr√≥d √âireann have phased out all locomotive hauled services, other than those using the 67 Mark 4 carriages on the Dublin-Cork Main Line and the Enterprise on the Dublin-Belfast Main Line, with 22000 Class railcars. Northern Ireland too has experienced recent rail investment. Central Station has been redesigned, and the Bleach Green-Antrim line, a more direct route for trains to Derry, was reopened in 2001 (although this led to the suspension of the Lisburn ‚Äì Antrim line and the closure of three rural stations). The line to Bangor was relaid. A new railcar fleet has entered service. The single-track line to Derry, north of Coleraine continues to be of a poor standard. A derailment in 2003, caused by cliff-side boulders falling onto the line, closed the route for some time. In the face of long journey times and a frequent (and generally faster) bus service, the route's future remains in some doubt. In March 2007, as part of the Transport 21 initiative, Docklands railway station opened, the first new station in Dublin city centre since 1891's . In July 2009, commuter trains began to run from Mallow to Cork, and on part of the reopened Cork to Youghal line to Midleton and to Cobh, a number of stations were opened, and there are plans for more stations on the lines.Glounthaune Midelton Railway All 100 Mark 3 carriages (dating back from 1980-1989) were phased out in September 2009 with capacity being taken up by 22000 Class railcars. Most of the Mark 3 fleet was scrapped between 2013 and 2014 but 11 were purchased by Belmond and converted for use as the Belmond Grand Hibernian in service since April 2016. =2010s= In September 2010 services began from Dunboyne to Dublin Docklands after the redevelopment of 7.5 km section of the old Navan railway line which had been closed in 1963 from Dunboyne to Clonsilla on the Maynooth line. There are proposals for further development of this line to Navan as part of Iarnr√≥d √âireann's plans by 2030. More deliveries of Commuter and InterCity 22000 Class railcars took place from March 2007 until April 2012, when the final deliveries took place. The route west to Kildare was quadrupled between 2007 and 2010. NI Railways underwent a major investment programme over the past few years, with track upgrades to the line between Belfast and Derry and 20 new trains which replaced the remaining Class 80 and Class 450 rolling stock. The new trains were a development of the existing Class 3000 units, the Class 4000, which entered service in 2011 and 2012. Until 2013 Ireland was the only European Union state that had not implemented EU Directive 91/440 and related legislation, having derogated its obligation to split train operations and infrastructure businesses; a similar situation exists in Northern Ireland. A consultation on the restructuring of I√â took place in 2012. The derogation ended on 14 March 2013, when Iarnr√≥d √âireann was split in two sectors: Railway Undertaking and Infrastructure Manager. Former Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar indicated that any open access private operators would not receive any subsidy to operate.Sources:  Future projects In relation to fleet expansion, orders of DARTs were suspended indefinitely in October 2009, but Dublin suburban routes are almost at capacity. Some call for the expansion of the rail network in the Republic. The route from Limerick to Waterford is due to have a realistic service for the first time in decades. Nevertheless, this is the only non-Dublin InterCity route in existence. A railway right of way exists from Limerick, up through the west, to Sligo. This has been titled the Western Railway Corridor (WRC) and some see it as a possible counterbalance to investment in Dublin. Phase 1 is complete with the line from Ennis to Athenry open since March 2010. Phases 2 and 3, from Athenry to Tuam, with an extension from Tuam to Claremorris to link up with the Westport/Ballina line to Dublin, are deferred indefinitely. Future proposals would see the line extended to Sligo, where it would also link with Ireland West Airport Knock.

His philosophy, known as \\"Krausism\\", was very influential in Restoration Spain. Education and life Educated at first at Eisenberg, he proceeded to the nearby University of Jena, where he studied philosophy under professors Friedrich W. Schelling, G. W. F. Hegel and Johann Gottlieb Fichte and became Privatdozent in 1802. In the same year, with characteristic imprudence, he married Sophie Amalie Concordia Fuchs (born 1780), without dowry. Two years later, lack of pupils compelled him to move to Rudolstadt and later to Dresden, where he gave lessons in music. In 1805 his ideal of a universal world-society led him to join the Freemasons, whose principles seemed to tend in the direction he desired. In Dresden he published two books on Freemasonry, H√∂here Vergeistigung der echt √ºberlieferten Grundsymbole der Freimaurerei: in zw√∂lf Logenvortr√§gen (1811) and Die drei √§ltesten Kunsterkunden der Freimaurerbr√ºderschaft (1819), but his opinions attracted opposition from the Masons. He lived for a time in Berlin and became a privatdozent, but was unable to obtain a professorship. He therefore proceeded to Dresden (where he taught Arthur Schopenhauer) and afterwards to Munich, where he died of apoplexy at the very moment when the influence of Franz von Baader had at last obtained a position for him. Philosophical work One of the so-called , Krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a God known by faith or conscience and the world as known to sense. God, intuitively known by conscience, is not a personality (which implies limitations), but an all- inclusive essence (Wesen), which contains the universe within itself. This system he called panentheism, a combination of monotheism and pantheism. His theory of the world and of humanity is therefore universal and idealistic. In many ways following the general outline of Schelling's Philosophy of Nature, he argued that the world itself and mankind, its highest component, constitute an organism (Gliedbau), and the universe is therefore a divine organism (Wesengliedbau). The process of development is the formation of higher unities, and the last stage is the identification of the world with God. The form which this development takes, according to Krause, is Right or the Perfect Law. Right is not the sum of the conditions of external liberty but of absolute liberty, and embraces all the existence of nature, reason and humanity. It is the mode, or rationale, of all progress from the lower to the highest unity or identification. By its operation the reality of nature and reason rises into the reality of humanity. God is the reality which transcends and includes both nature and humanity. Right is, therefore, at once the dynamic and the safeguard of progress. Ideal society results from the widening of the organic operation of this principle from the individual man to small groups of men, and finally to mankind as a whole. The differences disappear as the inherent identity of structure predominates in an ever-increasing degree, and in the final unity Man is merged in God. Influence and works The comparatively small area of Krause's influence was due partly to him being overshadowed by Schelling and Hegel, and partly to two intrinsic defects. The spirit of his thought is mystical and by no means easy to follow, and this difficulty is accentuated, even to German readers, by the use of artificial terminology. He makes use of Germanized foreign terms which are unintelligible to the ordinary man. His principal works are (beside those quoted above): Entwurf des Systems der Philosophie (1804); System der Sittenlehre (1810); Das Urbild der Menschheit (1811); and Vorlesungen √ºber das System der Philosophie (1828). He left behind him at his death a mass of unpublished notes, part of which has been collected and published by his disciples Karl David August R√∂derKarl David August R√∂der (June 23, 1806 - December 20, 1879) (1806-1879), Heinrich AhrensHeinrich Ahrens (July 14, 1808 - August 2, 1874) (1808‚Äì1874), Friedrich Wilhelm Theodor SchliephakeFriedrich Wilhelm Theodor Schliephake (April 28, 1808 - September 8, 1871) (1808-1871), Hermann Karl von LeonhardiHermann Karl von Leonhardi (March 12, 1809 - August 21, 1875). His original full name was Peter Karl Pius Gustav Hermann von Leonhardi. On October 19, 1841 he married Marie Sidonie Krause (aka Maria Sidonia Krause) (August 14, 1810 - 1875), who was a daughter of K. C. F. Krause (1781-1832). (1809-1875) (Krause's son-in-law), Guillaume TiberghienGuillaume Tiberghien (August 9, 1819 - November 28, 1901) (1819-1901), and others. Krausism became particularly influential in Spain in the 19th century, where Krause's ideas were introduced by Juli√°n Sanz del R√≠oJuli√°n Sanz del R√≠o (March 10, 1814 - October 12, 1869) (1814-1869), an academic based in Madrid. Spanish Krausists combined an emphasis on scientific rationalism and a liberal commitment to individual freedom and opposition to privilege and arbitrary power with Christian spirituality. Spanish intellectuals influenced by Krause included Francisco Giner de los R√≠os (1839-1915) and Gumersindo de Azc√°rate (1840-1917). In addition Krause's influence extended to Latin America, where his work made an impact on Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen (1852-1933), Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez (1856-1929) and Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo (1904-1990). Richard Gott has argued that Krause influenced Jos√© Mart√≠ (1853-1895), Fidel Castro (1926-2016) (through Mart√≠ and other Cuban thinkers), and Che Guevara (1928-1967) (through the influence of Yrigoyen).

The Japanese saw' or ' is a type of saw used in woodworking and Japanese carpentry that cuts on the pull stroke, unlike most European saws that cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws are the best known pull saws, but they are also used in China, Iran, Iraq, Korea, Nepal and Turkey. Among European saws, both coping saws for woodworking and jeweler's saws for metal working also cut on the pull stroke like Japanese saws. Cutting on the pull stroke is claimed to cut more efficiently and leave a narrower cut width (kerf). On the other hand, a pull stroke does not easily permit putting one's body weight behind a stroke. This can be readily solved by using a vice or clamping. Another disadvantage, due to the arrangement and form of the teeth, is that Japanese saws do not work as well on hardwoods as European saws do. Japanese saws were originally intended for comparatively soft woods like cypress and pine whereas European saws were intended for hard woods like oak and maple. The popularity of Japanese saws in other regions of the world has resulted in the manufacture and production of a number of Japanese saws outside of Japan.

The imago is the only stage during which the insect is sexually mature and, if it is a winged species, has functional wings. The imago often is referred to as the adult stage. Members of the order Ephemeroptera (mayflies) do not have a pupal stage, but they briefly pass through an extra winged stage called the subimago. Insects at this stage have functional wings but are not yet sexually mature. Eristalis tenax is another example of an insect that goes through an imago stage.

The band was first called Avatar, but, shortly before the release of their debut album Sirens (1983), they changed their name to Savatage as Avatar was already taken by another band. Savatage is considered a significant member of the American heavy metal movement of the early-to-mid 1980s, and has been cited as a key influence on many genres such as power metal, progressive metal, speed metal, thrash metal, death metal and symphonic metal. Savatage has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, four compilations and three EPs. The band first reached substantial commercial success with its third studio album Fight for the Rock (1986), which peaked at number 158 on the Billboard 200. Its next four albums‚ÄîHall of the Mountain King (1987), Gutter Ballet (1989), Streets: A Rock Opera (1991) and Edge of Thorns (1993)‚Äîwere also successful, but more critically acclaimed than Fight for the Rock. On October 17, 1993, six months after the release of Edge of Thorns, guitarist Criss Oliva was killed in a car accident. Following his death, Jon (along with producer Paul O'Neill) decided to continue Savatage in memory of his brother. The band released four more studio albums, and went through several line-up changes before going on an extended hiatus in 2002. During the years‚Äîpartly even before the hiatus‚Äîmembers founded various new bands such as Jon Oliva's Pain, Trans- Siberian Orchestra, Circle II Circle and Doctor Butcher. On August 2, 2014, Savatage announced that they were reuniting for the 2015 Wacken Open Air; although they discussed the possibility of more shows and new music, the band has not performed live since their 2015 appearance at the Wacken Open Air Festival, nor released an official statement regarding their future.  Biography  = Early days (1979‚Äì1986) = Criss Oliva and his brother Jon formed their first band together, Avatar, in 1979, from the ashes of their former bands Tower and Alien respectively. In 1980, the duo met up with Steve \\"Doc\\" Wacholz and practiced in a small shack behind the Oliva home that was dubbed \\"The Pit\\" by the band. Wacholz originally tried out to be part of Jon's band, Alien, but when the first Savatage line-up was taking shape, Jon, who was originally on drum duties, was relieved of them by Wacholz. They also gave Steve a nickname that would follow him throughout his career: \\"Doctor Hardware Killdrums\\", often shortened to just \\"Doc\\" or \\"Doc Killdrums\\", which referred to Steve's hard playing style. Criss, Jon and Steve played Tampa (where they had moved with their family in the late 1970s) and Clearwater area clubs for many years. In 1981, Keith Collins joined them to relieve Jon of bass guitar duties. In late 2006, footage was released onto the internet of an early performance by Avatar at a gig in a Clearwater, Florida parking lot and was prominent in featuring an early version of the song \\"Holocaust\\", which would later be released on Savatage's first album and a cover of Van Halen's \\"Eruption\\" and VH's version of \\"You Really Got Me\\". In 1982, Avatar took part in some heavy metal compilations, most notably \\"The YNF Pirate Tape\\", a promotion by Tampa rock radio station 95ynf for local Florida bands. Shortly after its release, \\"Avatar\\" was forced to change its name due to copyright issues. Combining the words \\"Savage\\" and \\"Avatar\\", the band decided on Savatage. Their first two albums, Sirens and The Dungeons Are Calling, were released on Par Records, an independent label. In 1985, they signed a contract with Atlantic Records and released their third album Power of the Night. Power of the Night, which was produced by Max Norman, who would go on to produce Megadeth's 1992 album Countdown to Extinction, showcased the band's unorthodox approach to metal, which included Jon's liberal use of keyboards on songs like \\"Fountain of Youth\\" and Broadway-style song structures like the kind employed on \\"Warriors\\". It was well received by critics but fell short of sales expectations. Atlantic budgeted to provide funds to make a video for \\"Hard for Love\\", on the condition that it be retitled \\"Hot for Love\\" for broadcast purposes. The band refused to change the song and consequently a video was not released. In 1986, after the release of their fourth album, Fight for the Rock, a failed attempt at a commercial approach imposed by the record company which the band themselves called Fight for the Nightmare, Savatage toured with Metallica, KISS and Mot√∂rhead. The band were not happy with the record, with pressure from the label to include two cover versions. Jon Oliva had been retained to write material for other artists on the Atlantic label, such as John Waite and other pop-rockers. Later, the label demanded Savatage record the material themselves. In a choice they would later regret, the band agreed. Not only did it destroy them in the press, it nearly destroyed the band and sent Jon into his early alcohol and drug problems. Jon recently admitted however the album did have strong points, including the band's cover of Badfinger's \\"Day After Day\\". During this time, original bassist Keith Collins left the band, and Johnny Lee Middleton joined the band. Since 1987, Johnny has been the only consistent member of Savatage, performing on every album (except Handful of Rain). = Rise to popularity (1987‚Äì1993) = In 1987, Savatage released their first commercially successful album, Hall of the Mountain King, which became the base for the band rising into a more mainstream arena. The band recorded their first music video for the album's title song, which received extensive air play on MTV's Headbangers Ball and was followed up by a video for the song \\"24 Hours Ago\\". The album introduced a new musical style, featuring symphonic elements, strongly influenced by their new producer, Paul O'Neill, that would shape the band's future recordings. O'Neill contributed most of the lyrics for the rest of their career and gave them a more conceptual edge starting with their next album, Gutter Ballet. Gutter Ballet, which was released in 1989, has been considered the band's true turning point. Since that album, the band has adopted a more progressive style, writing longer songs with more complex melodies and differing vocal styles, rather than the more straightforward power metal style that was apparent in earlier works. The change to a more progressive, operatic style was also precipitated by Jon, after seeing a performance of Phantom of the Opera in Toronto. The songs \\"Gutter Ballet\\" and \\"When the Crowds Are Gone\\" are examples of this influence from that album, as was the next Savatage's release (which even included \\"Opera\\" in its title). Again, two videos were made for the songs \\"When the Crowds Are Gone\\" and \\"Gutter Ballet\\" which received airplay on MTV. Many additional songs already written, before the decision of this change of style, were unused and subsequently published as bonus tracks, in the Sirens and The Dungeons Are Calling 2002 reissues, some of them were also re-worked and published by Jon Oliva's Pain. Chris Caffery, who had been playing with Savatage in the previous tour performing rhythm guitar and keyboards offstage, officially joined the band in 1989. He didn't play on the Gutter Ballet album, but was credited with guitars and keyboards and was pictured in the album's booklet \\"both to prepare the fans for the line-up they'd see on tour and confirm his permanent member status\\".liner notes from Gutter Ballet 2002 re-issue. Despite this, Caffery left the band after the Gutter Ballet tour for personal reasons, but kept writing music with Jon Oliva and would later return to Savatage during the second half of the 90's. In 1991, the band created their first rock opera Streets, featuring the story of a fallen rock star called DT Jesus who has hit hard times. The record did not sell as well as the band would have liked however, as it was released around the time that grunge exploded into the mainstream music arena, but a video for \\"Jesus Saves\\" was recorded and again got airplay, drawing a new audience to appreciate the band. Over the years Streets: A Rock Opera has become one of the most appreciated and a landmark album in Savatage's career. Originally, this record was intended to be a double album, but Atlantic Records did not like the idea, so it was trimmed down to 17 songs. The album was then going to have spoken tracks in-between all the songs but that was scrapped also. The final version scrapped the 17th song \\"Larry Elbows\\" and erased all the spoken tracks except for the intro to Jesus Saves. The cover had the story explained in it to make up for the lost spoken tracks. Atlantic somehow over the years managed to lose the master tapes to Streets so the left over songs truly are lost. Many of the riffs from these songs showed up on the next album Edge of Thorns. Another interesting detail about the album is that \\"Jesus Saves\\" was originally written as a midtempo song, not the rocker it became on the finished album. In 2013, a narrated version of the album was re-issued with the title: Streets: A Rock Opera - Narrated Version. After a tour in support of the album, in 1992, Jon Oliva left the band to concentrate on his side projects Doctor Butcher and his Broadway-bound musical Romanov, as well as continuing co-writing Savatage material with his brother Criss and producer Paul O'Neill. However, as of 2013, only one instrumental track from the Romanov project was released under the moniker Trans-Siberian Orchestra on the Dreams Of Fireflies EP. After this EP, together with a Broadway version of Streets named Gutter Ballet (including mainly songs from both these albums), even Romanov is planned as a future Trans-Siberian Orchestra album. On 13 June 1992, during the Jon's Farewell Show at Rock-It Club in Tampa, 28 songs were played to cover all the main highlights of the band. This show was not intended, recorded or filmed for any sort of live album. The new lead vocalist, former Wicked Witch singer Zachary Stevens, was discovered and introduced to the band by Criss's best friend and guitar technician Dan Campbell. The band recorded their follow-up to Streets, Edge of Thorns, in 1993. Drummer Steve Wacholz decided to record the album but he was not interested in touring, even though he stated he intended to return to the band in the future, and hand-picked his replacement as well in drummer Andy James. For the first time, Savatage began to enjoy mainstream recognition, including increased radio play and a world tour which gained international press as \\"the best Savatage has ever sounded live\\". However, tragedy struck when founder and lead guitarist Criss Oliva was killed by a drunk driver on October 17, 1993.Tony Green, \\"Associates mourn Savatage star\\", St. Petersburg Times (Florida), October 19, 1993, p. 6B Jon chose to continue the band, although he has since admitted that the band was pretty much over after Criss's death, but only kept going because of his memory and to \\"keep his music alive\\". = After Criss (1994‚Äì2000) = A short while after Criss' death, the band held a tribute show for the late guitarist, with the same line-up as the Streets tour but without Criss. Lead guitarist Alex Skolnick temporarily joined Savatage in 1994 for the release of their ninth album Handful of Rain, written by Jon Oliva and Paul O'Neill. Although the album is technically a Jon Oliva solo album, with Jon handling all instrumental duties except for vocals by Zachary Stevens and lead guitars by Alex Skolnick, the record was released under the Savatage moniker with bass and drum credits given to Middleton and Wacholz respectively, as drummer Andy James had left the band following the death of Criss Oliva to pursue other projects. The song \\"Chance\\" was the first Savatage song to contain the usage of counterpoint vocals, a style which they continued to use on following albums. The album's final track, \\"Alone You Breathe\\", was a tribute to Criss Oliva. When the band were preparing to tour in support of Handful of Rain, drummer Steve Wacholz announced his official departure from the band. Jeff Plate, a former bandmember of Zak Stevens' old band, was hired to replace him. Jon Oliva agreed to do the tour to perform keyboards and rhythm guitar, and a live CD/VHS entitled Japan Live '94 (in later releases it has been retitled Live in Japan) was released at the conclusion of the very short tour with Skolnick's three-piece band Exhibit-A and power metal band Tempo Tantrum as supporting-acts. After this tour, Alex Skolnick left the band to pursue other interests. In a 2011 interview, Skolnick had this to say about his time with Savatage: While Skolnick adapted Criss Oliva's solos to his own style, former guitarist Chris Caffery, who had left after the Gutter Ballet tour, was convinced he could do them better. He then told Jon Oliva that he would rejoin the band to pay tribute to his friend and mentor Criss Oliva on the condition that he would play all of Criss' solos, which the band accepted. Atlantic Records, however, wanted a second, more well-known guitarist to join the band, and Al Pitrelli was chosen. Pitrelli was known for his previous work with Alice Cooper and Asia, among others, and would play the majority of the lead parts of the band's new material. In 1995, Savatage released their second rock opera Dead Winter Dead, an even more ambitious undertaking than its predecessor, Streets. They also achieved cross-over success with \\"Christmas Eve Sarajevo 12/24\\", which received heavy rotation on multiple radio formats during the Christmas season. While they toured Europe and Japan, the group forwent an American tour to work on their new project, Christmas Eve and Other Stories, recorded by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra (TSO), comprising Savatage and a large orchestra. Jon Oliva has since admitted that he was annoyed to see the success of TSO with what was originally a Savatage song, leading him to believe that the biggest barrier to success as Savatage was the name. Also in 1995, another live album Ghost in the Ruins ‚Äì A Tribute to Criss Oliva was published with old recordings taken during the Gutter Ballet tour. This release is titled Final Bell in Japan and Ghost in the Ruins elsewhere. Ghost in the Ruins was one of the titles the band previously considered for the album Streets. The eleventh studio album, The Wake of Magellan, was released in 1997 after a break to deal with the huge success of TSO, and dealt with such concepts as the worth of a life, suicide and drug abuse, drawing on real- life events such as the Maersk Dubai and the murder of Veronica Guerin. Savatage parted ways with long-time label Atlantic after this release and eventually signed on with a much smaller organization, Nuclear Blast (although Trans-Siberian Orchestra albums would in the future remain on the Atlantic/Lava imprint). Jon Oliva said that this was a good move, as Nuclear Blast \\"loved the band and they know our songs and everything!\\". Due to Jon, O'Neill and Savatage's long time engineer Robert Kinkel's songwriting, the main differences between Savatage's last two albums and Trans-Siberian Orchestra are the usage of a real orchestra and the fact lead vocals are not played only by Oliva and/or Zachary Stevens, as in Savatage, but by a huge number of guest singers. = Poets and Madmen, hiatus and side projects (2001‚Äì2013) = The Poets and Madmen touring lineup, 2001. From left to right: Jeff Plate, Chris Caffery, Jon Oliva, Damond Jiniya, Johnny Lee Middleton, Jack Frost. Savatage continued to focus on their Trans-Siberian Orchestra project for a while, releasing The Christmas Attic, but the release of Poets and Madmen in 2001 was highlighted by Jon Oliva's return as lead vocalist in studio, replacing Zak Stevens, who left the band citing family reasons, and the departure of Al Pitrelli, who accepted an offer to join Megadeth in 2000. Pitrelli did record solos for some songs prior to his departure. Another very limited US tour followed, supported by Fates Warning in the early shows, and then Nevermore for the remainder. Around this time, Caffery chose Zak's replacement in the form of the singer Damond Jiniya (Diet of Worms), who was once again brought to the band from long-time friend and Circle II Circle manager/co founder Dan Campbell. Damond sang the song \\"Edge of Thorns\\" as his audition song. Damond performed Zak's parts on tour, with Jon having an increased vocal role in proceedings. Jack Frost auditioned for the role of rhythm guitar player, and got the gig. He played with the band for a majority of the tour, but was mysteriously asked to leave the band after the tour, although it could be said that Frost's commitments elsewhere drove him from the band. For Summer festival appearances in 2002, the band was joined by Annihilator's Jeff Waters. Savatage have remained inactive since that tour, with band members concentrating on other projects such as Trans-Siberian Orchestra and Jon Oliva's Pain. This has not pleased everyone, with Chris Caffery in particular citing his anger at Savatage not recording a new album in almost five years . Trans-Siberian Orchestra continues with their releases and Savatage's members are mostly split up between its two touring line-ups, but during the European tours in 2011 and 2014 Pitrelli, Caffery, Middleton and Plate were all featured together on stage. Year by year more Savatage songs were included in the TSO setlists, among them also Gutter Ballet, Believe, All That I Bleed and Chance. Jon Oliva usually doesn't play on stage with Trans-Siberian Orchestra while Paul O'Neill, in recent years, started to do it very often during some selected songs. Jon Oliva formed his own band, Jon Oliva's Pain, and released their first album in 2004 entitled 'Tage Mahal. Through the years Jon Oliva's Pain, also called JOP, published many records and their live concerts always feature Savatage's songs from the albums with Criss Oliva. Additional material, taken by Jon from his brother's unused stuff, was used to write several Jon Oliva's Pain's tracks as described in the album's credits. Lead guitarist Chris Caffery also recorded solo albums while former front man Zak Stevens was approached by long-time friend and Savatage stage manager Dan Campbell to co-found a new band Circle II Circle and their first record entitled Watching in Silence was released in 2003, produced by Jon Oliva and featuring a guest appearance from Caffery. After a dispute with the management during the tour, Zak's entire band left and joined Jon Oliva's Pain band. Zak regrouped with new members and release other new records. Since 2011, the band included more and more Savatage songs (from the records with Stevens at vocals) in their setlists, and in 2012 also the entire The Wake Of Magellan album was played. Their 2013 European tour included the complete Edge Of Thorns album due to its 20th anniversary while the 2014 European tour included the complete Handful of Rain album for the same reason. In addition to his work with Trans-Siberian Orchestra, drummer Jeff Plate performed with electric violinist Mark Wood and joined Metal Church. He also reformed Wicked Witch with Zak Stevens, renaming the band Machines of Grace, and releasing a self-titled album in 2010. Never involved with Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Steve Wacholz formed a new band in 2010, named Reverence, with guitarist Pete Rossi, vocalist Todd Michael Hall (formerly of Jack Starr's Burning Starr and currently in Riot V) and former Tokyo Blade members guitarist Bryan Holland and bassist Frank Saparti.  Criss Oliva 10th anniversary memorial concert  On 17 October 2003, at The Masquerade in historic Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, fans were invited to remember and celebrate the life and contributions of Criss Oliva at a 10th anniversary memorial concert. It featured Circle II Circle, Jon Oliva's Pain and Doctor Butcher as supporting acts and, as headliner, a special one night only band (composed of Jon Oliva, Johnny Lee Middleton, Steve \\"Doc\\" Wacholz, Chris Caffery and John Zahner) who played only selected songs from the albums with Criss Oliva. Many Criss parts were executed by Jon himself using keyboards. This show was not intended, recorded or filmed for any sort of live album.  Reunion rumors  In an interview to Aardschok, a Dutch Magazine, in June 2006, Jon Oliva announced that he wants to record one more Savatage album, with a live CD and DVD to follow it, before ending the band. He did not specify a release date for a new album, however. Chris Caffery then said in an interview in October 2006 that if a new Savatage album was to be recorded, then it's likely that Alex Skolnick would be involved, as well as original drummer Steve \\"Doc\\" Wacholz.blabbermouth.net: Chris Caffery Reveals Plans For Savatage DVDOct. 9, 2006. In a November 2006 interview to Greek website, MetalTemple.com, Jon Oliva himself shot down all rumours of the return of Savatage, claiming that it never made him any money, but instead it cost him one million US dollars to keep the band going over the years. Jon also said that his new band, Jon Oliva's Pain, is basically Savatage reincarnated, so it could co-exist with the more successful Trans-Siberian Orchestra. He did however state that a one- off anniversary tour featuring Skolnick, Wacholz and other past Savatage members is being planned with Paul O'Neill as a final send off to the band. Zachary Stevens has made it clear that he will participate in a 25th anniversary festivities with the band. Jon Oliva then said about the band \\"Well, it's over but it's not over, you know what I mean? It's over right now because no one's doing anything. We haven't disbanded or anything. We have plans to do something in the future.\\" Jon also announced that he is doing \\"some video compilation stuff, and editing old things for a bonus DVD to go with it, that has a ton of live Criss stuff in concert, a lot of backstage frolicking about, and going to castles in Europe\\". In 2007, Jon denied any rumours of a Savatage reunion and tour, as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra has become a year-round commitment, adding that Jon Oliva's Pain is \\"as close to Savatage as you can get\\". Despite Jon's earlier denials, in October 2008 the band launched an official MySpace page, hinting that 2009 would see some activity under the Savatage banner. The line-up listed on official MySpace is: Jon Oliva, Zak Stevens, Chris Caffery, Al Pitrelli, Johnny Lee Middleton and Jeff Plate; signalling that Stevens would return as lead vocalist in a reunion. In December of the same year, a brand new Savatage web site was unveiled. However, Jon Oliva has since denied these reunion rumors saying: In 2013, in support for Jon's first solo album titled Raise the Curtain, Jon has been giving many interviews, and during at least one he mentioned the possibility of new Savatage music is something he's considering. While discussing the success of TSO and the decision to cease activities as Savatage with Dr. Metal on 6/30/13 he had this to say about the idea of new Savatage recordings: = Official reunion, death of Paul O'Neill and future of the band (2014‚Äìpresent) = On August 2, 2014, it was announced that Trans-Siberian Orchestra would be performing live on stage at Wacken Open Air 2015, followed immediately by a Savatage reunion gig. It was announced as Savatage's only live show in Europe in 2015, which led to speculation that it would be a one- off reunion show, or the band had planned to continue performing in the future. Asked in a December 2014 interview if Savatage would do any more live shows or record new material, guitarist Chris Caffery replied, \\"I'm gonna put it this way: for 12 years, 13 years, I've been waiting for my band to play again. We're playing again. I don't know what's going to happen after that [laughs], but there were people that were putting a fork in it, and we're getting up and not just running a marathon, we're running in the Olympics with this festival being what it is. I'm not going to make any predictions, but let's just say there's a possibility that something more will happen after Wacken‚Äîthat's all I can say. And nothing would make me happier.\\" On the future of Savatage, frontman Jon Oliva explained, \\"As far as that goes, the whole Wacken thing came up, and I was, like, you know what? If we're going to do anything, we have to do it now. I don't want to do it when I'm 60 years old. I mentioned that to Paul. He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's just wait until the winter tour is over and then you and me we're going to sit down in January and discuss what we're going to do. Jon also said that Savatage has \\"already gotten offers\\" to play in \\"certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that\\", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, \\"I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on.\\" The Wacken started with a performance of Savatage on the Black Stage, featuring Gutter Ballet as first song. After seven songs the band left the stage, and on the True Metal Stage TSO began to play with Pitrelli and its non-Sava members. Caffery, Middleton and Plate replaced them on several songs, and Stevens had a duet with Andrew Ross in the song \\"The Hourglass\\". This set was followed up by simultaneous play by both bands, featuring also Savatage and TSO songs, ending up with O'Neill's appearance on guitar in \\"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\\" and \\"Requiem (The Fifth)\\". In October 2015, Zak Stevens confirmed the intentions of starting a new phase for Savatage, adding that (from November 1 on) there would be meetings to take decisions on the details, possibly a tour or a new album, since Jon Oliva is inspiredly writing new music. When asked in April 2016 about Savatage's future, drummer Jeff Plate (who had recently released an album with Metal Church) stated, \\"This really is a question for Jon and Paul. We had a tremendous time last year when we performed at the Wacken Open Air Festival. It truly was great, and magical, to perform with that band again. I would love to put the Dead Winter Dead band back on the road again, but this is not my decision to be made.\\" In April 2017, it was announced that Savatage producer, lyricist and co-composer Paul O'Neill had died at the age of 61. When asked in August 2017 about a possible reunion with a classic Savatage lineup (with Chris Caffery filling in for the late Criss Oliva on guitar), original drummer Steve \\"Doc\\" Wacholz mentioned a Savatage tour taking place in 2018. However, he stated, \\"I really can't imagine them having TWO drummers on stage, so Jeff will be doing the drumming duties on his own (which he does a great job), although I would love to finish what I started with the Olivas so long ago. That would be a great accomplishment, but I do not see it happening.\\" In a September 2018 interview with Bill Louis of WNCX radio, Plate stated that he would \\"really love to see\\" a Savatage reunion, but added that O'Neill's death and the success of Trans- Siberian Orchestra were the reasons the band has been sidelined since their 2015 reunion show at Wacken Open Air. He explained, \\"There's always been that thought. We did get back together for the Wacken show in 2015. There was a lot of talk after that show, because it was very well-received. When the band got back together, it's just so interesting how when a certain group of guys get together and play music, it's just different than plugging other people in. There's a real chemistry there with the six of us ‚Äî Jon Oliva, Chris Caffery, Johnny Middleton, Al Pitrelli, myself and Zak Stevens. Of course, there's always interest, but when we lost Paul, it had to get pushed aside. There's always conversations, and personally, I would really love to see it. We would love to make that happen, but with everything that's happened over the past couple of years, there's a lot going on there. Once all the business end of this whole scenario gets sorted out here and we all get in a room and really talk about some things... It's going to take a little time ‚Äî none of this stuff is easy ‚Äî but I would love to see it happen. I know a lot of people would, and I know a number of guys in the band would really like to see it happen too. But Trans-Siberian Orchestra, that's the focus ‚Äî that has been our success, and this is what our careers have become. If we can somehow squeeze some Savatage music or some shows in there around all this, that would be fantastic.\\" When asked in December 2019 about the current state of Savatage, Stevens said: \\"You've always got Savatage lurking out there that we really don't know for sure either. Basically the same answer that I get from them is what I'm giving for Circle II Circle ‚Äî 'You know what? It's not ever gone, but we just have to figure out what [to do], and the answer will come.' When the right situation appears, that's when I think things will happen... It needs the right thing to come along. I like the fact that TSO has five Savatage songs in the last half of the set this year, so something's brewing... I don't really have any more answers after that, but something seems like it's going on. We're going to find out one way or the other at some point, but the right situation has to come along, I think.\\"  Musical style  Savatage and its former variations started out as a heavy metal band, incorporating Jon Oliva's powerful, sometimes screamed vocals accompanied by Criss Oliva's heavy guitar riffs and fast, melodic solos. When bassist Johnny Lee Middleton joined in 1986, the band took a step in the direction of radio-friendly hardrock due to label pressure, but to no success. In 1987, producer Paul O'Neill was brought in and added symphonic elements to the band's sound, making Hall of the Mountain King the band's first progressive metal album. Around this time, vocalist Jon Oliva also started focusing more on keyboards and piano. The band's 1991 effort Streets: A Rock Opera was, as its name implies, a rock opera, the first of many to follow. After the departure of lead vocalist Jon Oliva, his replacement Zachary Stevens brought in a very different vocal sound. The band continued on the progressive metal/hard rock path, and when Jon Oliva rejoined the band, albums would often feature a few songs with him on lead vocals. One of the band's trademarks, especially in the band's later years, were the counterpoint and harmony vocals. In Savatage's early years guitarist Criss Oliva would sometimes provide backing vocals, but this decreased dramatically over the years so he could focus on guitar playing. The band's 1994 album Handful of Rain saw the introduction of counterpoint vocals with the song \\"Chance\\", and the subsequent albums had some of these incorporated as well. In the studio, Stevens' vocals would be layered on top of each other, but live Jon Oliva, Chris Caffery, Al Pitrelli and Johnny Lee Middleton would all also perform vocals. Savatage's main influences include Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Van Halen, Rainbow, UFO, The Beatles, Rush, The Who, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Queen, Mot√∂rhead, Scorpions, Accept, Saxon and Jethro Tull.  In popular culture  The song \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" from the album of the same name was used in the video game Br√ºtal Legend. Gutter Ballet was an unpublished Broadway project Paul O'Neill wrote back in 1979. In 1989, Savatage already used this title for their previous album but decided to focus their next release, Streets: A Rock Opera, on it. Trans-Siberian Orchestra reprised, in recent years, the idea to release a Gutter Ballet musical close to O'Neill original script featuring Savatage's music as well. German power metal band Powerwolf covered \\"Edge of Thorns\\" on their 2015 Blessed & Possessed deluxe edition. The song \\"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\\" from the album Dead Winter Dead was used in The Office in season 8 episode 10 \\"Christmas Wishes (The Office)\\".

New Jersey Geological Survey ‚Äì Dept. of Environmental Protection, 2007. Available online via NJ Geological Survey The lake was formed of waters released by the retreating Wisconsin Glacier, which had pushed large quantities of earth and rock ahead of its advance, blocking the previous natural drainage of the ancestral Passaic River through a gap in the central Watchung Mountains. The lake persisted for several thousand years as melting ice and eroding moraine dams slowly drained the former lake basin. The effect of the lake's creation permanently altered the course of the Passaic River, forcing it to take a circuitous route through the northern Watchung Mountains before spilling out into the lower piedmont. Today, the former lake basin is called Passaic Meadows and includes the Great Swamp, Black Meadows, Troy Meadows, Hatfield Swamp, Lee Meadows, Little Piece Meadows, Great Piece Meadows, Glenhurst Meadows, and Bog and Vly Meadows. These remnants of the ancient lake provide prime wetland habitat to a variety of plants and animals while at the same time offering recreational and outdoor opportunities to residents of northern New Jersey. Discovery The discovery of Glacial Lake Passaic is credited to Professor George Hammell Cook, once the State Geologist of New Jersey and Vice President of Rutgers University. Cook's first official mention of the lake was in the New Jersey Annual Report of the State Geologist for the Year 1880, in which he described flat-topped hills and drift-like deposits in the upper Passaic Valley that appeared to be created or modified by the waters of a lake.Cook, George H., State Geologist. Geological Survey of New Jersey ‚Äì Annual Report of the State Geologist for the year 1880. John L. Murphy, Book and Job Printer, Trenton, NJ, 1880. Available via NJ Geologic Survey Twelve years later, field research conducted under State Geologist John C. Smock began to uncover wave-cut terraces and other shoreline features that more conclusively established the lake's existence.Smock, John C., State Geologist. Geological Survey of New Jersey ‚Äì Annual Report of the State Geologist for the year 1892. The John L. Murphy Publishing Company Printers, Trenton, NJ, 1893. Available via NJ Geologic Survey However, the boundaries of the lake were not completely understood until the following year, 1893, when geologists Rollin D. Salisbury and Henry B. K√ºmmel completed a study of wave cut terraces, shoreline platforms, and delta deposits within the central and upper Passaic basin. The study was used to create a report, Lake Passaic ‚Äì An Extinct Glacial Lake, which was included in the New Jersey Annual Report of the State Geologist for the Year 1893.Smock, John C., State Geologist. Geological Survey of New Jersey ‚Äì Annual Report of the State Geologist for the year 1893. The John L. Murphy Publishing Company Printers, Trenton, NJ, 1894. Available online via NJ Geological Survey or Google Books Geology During the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods, when the North American plate separated from the African plate, an aborted rift system was created. The resulting rift valley, known as the Newark Basin, was filled with alternating layers of red bed sediment and flood basalts. Over millions of years, the rift valley was faulted, tilted, and eroded, until the edges of the hard flood basalt layers formed ridges. Prior to 20,000 years before the present, an ancestral Passaic River flowed through a gap in these ridges. This changed when the Wisconsin Glacier, a massive continental ice sheet which formed during the last ice age, advanced on the region and permanently plugged the gap. As the glacier eventually melted back, water pooled behind the ridges (known today as the Watchung Mountains), forming Glacial Lake Passaic. Lake stages Glacial Lake Passaic was a dynamic water body during its five millennia of existence. At present, the lake is believed to have existed in four major stages, the final stage being split between three smaller sub- stages. Each stage saw a new shoreline elevation of the lake as ice or earthen moraine dams were built or gave way, often over brief spans of time. =Chatham Stage= Approximately 20,000 years ago, the Wisconsin Glacier advanced across northern New Jersey, expanding differentially across the land as it encountered variable terrain. West of the Watchung Mountains and east of the Appalachians, the Passaic lobe of the great glacier was impeded by rugged terrain, slowing its southward advance. East of the Watchung Mountains, the Hackensack lobe of the glacier spread more easily over the piedmont lowlands, advancing on the Hobart/Short Hills Gap. Previously, an ancestral Passaic River flowed southeast toward Raritan Bay through the gap, but as the Hackensack lobe dammed it with ice, a lake began to form, reaching depths of nearly 200 feet. The resulting body of water formed the Chatham Stage, which initially found an outlet to the sea via the Blue Brook Valley, between the ridges of First and Second Watchung Mountain south of the Short Hills Gap. This outlet, however, was cut off as the Hackensack lobe continued to push south. =Moggy Hollow Stage= The Hackensack lobe of the Wisconsin Glacier piled a massive moraine into the Short Hills Gap and northern Blue Brook Valley, effectively creating a permanent dam even after the ice began retreating to the north. With its outlet to the sea severed, Glacial Lake Passaic rose until it found a new escape point via a gap in the southwestern Watchung Mountains known as Moggy Hollow. The Moggy Hollow Stage came to be the deepest stage of the ancient lake, reaching a depth of about 300 ft. Eventually, it came to cover the greatest area too. As the Wisconsin Glacier melted back, the lake's waters ultimately submerged an area stretching from the base of Preakness Mountain in Wayne to the northern slope of Second Watchung Mountain in Liberty Corner. During this time, it is believed that the ridges of Third Watchung Mountain formed a sinuous chain of islands running down the length of lake. =Great Notch Stage= The first major drop in the level of Glacial Lake Passaic occurred as the Wisconsin Glacier melted back to reveal the Great Notch, a significant gap present in the ridge of First Watchung Mountain in Clifton. In a short span of time, the level of the lake fell approximately 80 feet, the resulting drainage carving a spillway that would eventually become the valley of the Third River. The Great Notch Stage, as it came to be called, produced a lake of similar depth to the Chatham Stage, although covering a greater area. It is believed that Hook Mountain, one of the ridges of Third Watchung Mountain, was still an island at this time. =Postglacial stages= The Great Notch Stage came to an end as the Wisconsin Glacier withered to reveal a gap in First Watchung Mountain in Paterson. The gap's initial opening likely caused a flood which carved the valley of Weasel Brook, but the outflow eventually migrated further north, forming the course of the Passaic River as it exists today. The release of water through the gap at Paterson saw the destruction of the last remaining ice dam holding back the lake. But topography and moraine deposits left in key chokepoints allowed the remains of the Great Notch Stage to split into three lakes of considerable size. These lakes would persist for another 3000 to 4000 years. Totowa Stage The Totowa Stage was most northern of the three postglacial lakes, occupying an irregular basin extending from Oakland to Whippany. The lake was held back by a dam of glacial sediment in Totowa that slowly eroded until the surface of the lake fell to its present-day level, leaving behind the Hatfield Swamp, Black Meadows, Great Piece Meadows, and Bog and Vly Meadows. Stanley Stage Upstream of the Totowa Stage, and lying between Second and Third Watchung Mountain, was the Stanley Stage. The lake occupied an area between Stanley (near Summit) and Millington, and was held back by moraine deposits. As with the Totowa stage, the lake's earthen dam eroded away until the lake reached its modern level, forming Glenhurst Meadows. Millington Stage The most upstream of three lakes, the Millington Stage was probably 50 feet deep at maximum, occupying the basin west of Long Hill, the southernmost ridge of Third Watchung Mountain. Unlike the other two lakes, the Millington Stage drained over the trap rock crest of Long Hill. But even rock could not contain one of the last pieces of Glacial Lake Passaic. By about 14,000 years ago, water spilling through a gap in Long Hill carved the Millington Gorge, which lowered the level of the lake to form the present-day Great Swamp. Modern lake basin =Conservation= A typical scene along the Passaic River which results from the drainage of the Great Swamp, a remnant of the Glacial Lake Passaic The remnants of the Glacial Lake Passaic lake bed are found in several swamps in northern New Jersey, most notably, the Great Swamp that is south of Morristown through Chatham Township, lying in extreme southern Morris County and northeastern Somerset County. The watershed of the Great Swamp entails . Within this watershed, Black Brook, Great Brook, Loantaka Brook, Primrose Brook, and the Upper Passaic River combine their waters in the Great Swamp to form the Passaic River, which exits the swamp via the Millington Gorge. Following the largest American conservation effort by residents in response to a proposal to build a huge fourth regional airport that would have destroyed the ecosystem, a major portion of this watershed was acquired through assembling purchases made during a year-long effort that began in 1959. Those properties, entailing or just under twelve square miles, were preserved through a donation to the federal government on November 3, 1960, setting them aside as a park for perpetual protection. The area given to the government has since become the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and now is watched over by citizens from the ten communities that ring the swamp, who have formed thirteen separate oversight organizations. Additions to the area have continued to the present day. =Flooding= Chronic flooding in the central Passaic basin, particularly around the confluence of the Passaic and Pompton rivers, has been severe enough to lead to government buyouts of private land. This section of the basin, upstream of the chokepoint created by the Little Falls and the Great Falls, occasionally fills with so much water that some of the Totowa Stage of Glacial Lake Passaic briefly reappears until enough time has gone by for the water to drain out. The Passaic River Flood Tunnel, a floodwater diversion system, has been proposed to create a new escape route for water trapped behind the Watchung Mountains.

A full-time writer, he also designed his own book covers and publicity. His books have sold 54 million copies worldwide, and have been translated into 34 languages, including Chinese and Russian. Biography Born in London, Herbert was the son of Herbert Herbert, a stall-holder at London's Brick Lane Market. He attended a Catholic school in Bethnal Green called Our Lady of the Assumption, then at 11 won a scholarship to St Aloysius Grammar School in Highgate. He left school at 15 and studied at Hornsey College of Art, joining the art department of John Collings, a small advertising agency. He left the agency to join Charles Barker Advertising where he worked as art director and then group head. James Herbert's gravestone in the churchyard of St. Peter's, Woodmancote Herbert lived in Woodmancote, near Henfield in West Sussex. He had two brothers: Peter, a retired market trader and John, an insurance broker. Herbert would write his drafts in longhand on \\"jumbo pads\\". In 1979 Herbert had to pay damages when it was ruled that he had based part of his novel The Spear on the work of another writer, The Spear of Destiny by Trevor Ravenscroft. In 2010 Herbert was honoured with the World Horror Convention Grand Master Award, presented to him by Stephen King. Later in the same year, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours, presented by Prince Charles. On 20 March 2013, Herbert died suddenly at his home in Sussex at the age of 69. No cause of death was given but a spokeswoman for the publisher said that he had not been ill. He is survived by his wife, Eileen, and three daughters. His estate was valued at ¬£8.3 million. Work His first two books, The Rats and The Fog, were disaster novels with man-eating giant black rats in the first and an accidentally released chemical weapon in the second. The first print run of The Rats (100,000 copies) sold out in three weeks. Herbert wrote three sequels to The Rats: Lair, which deals with a second outbreak of the mutant black rats, this time in the countryside around Epping Forest rather than in the first book's London slums; in Domain, a nuclear war means that the rats have become the dominant species in a devastated city; the third sequel, the graphic novel The City, is an adventure set in the post-nuclear future. With his third novel, the ghost story The Survivor, Herbert used supernatural horror rather than the science fiction horror of his first two books. In Shrine, he explored his Roman Catholic heritage with the story of an apparent miracle which turns out to be something much more sinister. Haunted, the story of a sceptical paranormal investigator taunted by malicious ghosts, began life as a screenplay for the BBC, though this was not the screenplay used in the eventual film version. Its sequels were The Ghosts of Sleath and Ash.https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/fiction/talking-terror-the-james- herbert-interview Others of Herbert's books, such as Moon, Sepulchre and Portent, are structured as thrillers and include espionage and detective story elements along with the supernatural. The Jonah is in large part of the story of a police investigation, albeit by a policeman whose life is overshadowed by a supernatural presence. The Spear deals with a neo-Nazi cult in Britain and an international conspiracy which includes a right-wing US general and an arms dealer. '48 is an alternative history novel set in 1948 in which the Second World War ended with the release of a devastating plague by the defeated Hitler and, like The Spear, features British characters who sympathise with the Nazis. Others narrates the story of a physically deformed private detective. Herbert had previously tackled the theme of reincarnation in his fourth novel, Fluke, the story of a dog who somehow remembers his previous life as a human being. Rumbo, one of the characters from Fluke also turns up in The Magic Cottage. Once... includes another reference to the character of Rumbo (along with an in-joke of elven folk having names of reversed titles of Herbert's previous novels; 'Hanoj', 'Niamod', 'Noom', etc.). Nobody True continues the theme of life after death, being narrated by a ghost whose investigation of his own death results in the destruction of his illusions about his life. Herbert described Creed as his Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. The character Joe Creed is a cynical, sleazy paparazzo who is drawn into a plot involving fed-up and underappreciated monsters. The novel The Secret of Crickley Hall, originally scheduled for release in April 2006, was eventually released in October. A long novel about a haunted country house in England, it examined the relationship between religious zealotry and child abuse. One of the characters in this novel is named after a real person, who won the honour by having the winning bid in the 2004 BBC Radio 2 Children in Need Auction. Various biographical and critical pieces by and about Herbert have been collected in James Herbert: By Horror Haunted, edited by Stephen Jones, and also in James Herbert ‚Äì Devil in the Dark, written by Craig Cabell. Herbert released a new novel virtually every year from 1974 to 1988, wrote six novels during the 1990s and released three new works in the 2000s. \\"I am very insecure about being a writer\\", he stated in the book Faces of Fear. \\"I don't understand why I am so successful. And the longer I stay that way, the better it's going to be, because that's what keeps me on the edge, striving if you like.\\" Herbert's final novel has an eerie political edge. Ash imagines Princess Diana and her secret son as well as Lord Lucan, Colonel Gaddafi and Robert Maxwell living together in a Scottish castle. He was the subject of a This is Your Life programme in 1995, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the London Dungeon. Reception \\"Herbert was by no means literary, but his work had a raw urgency,\\" said Stephen King. \\"His best novels, The Rats and The Fog, had the effect of Mike Tyson in his championship days: no finesse, all crude power. Those books were best sellers because many readers (including me) were too horrified to put them down.\\" \\"There are few things I would like to do less than lie under a cloudy night sky while someone read aloud the more vivid passages of Moon,\\" Andrew Postman wrote in The New York Times Book Review. \\"In the thriller genre, do recommendations come any higher?\\" List of works ;Novels *The Rats (1974; first instalment in the Rats series) *The Fog (1975) *The Survivor (1976) *Fluke (1977) *The Spear (1978) *Lair (1979; second instalment in the Rats series) *The Dark (1980) *The Jonah (1981) *Shrine (1983) *Domain (1984; third instalment in the Rats series) *Moon (1985) *The Magic Cottage (1986) *Sepulchre (1987) *Haunted (1988) *Creed (1990) *Portent (1992) *The Ghosts of Sleath (1994) *'48 (1996) *Others (1999) *Once (2001) *Nobody True (2003) *The Secret of Crickley Hall (2006) *Ash (2012) ;Graphic novel *The City (1993; fourth instalment in the Rats series)Illustrated by Ian Miller. ;Non-fiction *James Herbert: By Horror Haunted (1992)Collection of works and interviews, edited by Stephen Jones.

The township administrative offices are located in Glen Tay. Tay Valley township is distinct from the Township of Tay, 300 km to the west. History The township was incorporated on January 1, 1998 by amalgamating the former townships of Bathurst, South Sherbrooke and North Burgess, which date back to the early 19th century. It was originally known as the township of Bathurst Burgess Sherbrooke, but adopted the name of Tay Valley on July 30, 2002. The Canadian Pacific Railway's original mainline (CP Havelock Subdivision) passed through Glen Tay heading west to Havelock then on to Toronto before being abandoned to Tweed in 1973 and to Havelock in 1987. A newer mainline was branched off west of Glen Tay southwest towards Belleville which still handles the CP Rail traffic from Smith Falls to Toronto. Communities The township comprises the communities of Althorpe, Bathurst Station, Bells Corners, Bolingbroke, Bolingbroke Siding, Brooke, Christie Lake, DeWitts Corners, Elliot, Fallbrook, Feldspar, Glen Tay, Harper, Maberly, Playfairville, Pratt Corners, Scotch Line, Stanleyville and Wemyss. The permanent population was 5,571 in the 2011 census. However, similar to adjacent townships, there are also numerous seasonal residents, predominantly cottagers from Ottawa or Kingston. The total population including seasonal residents is estimated over 10,000, in 3,843 households.

The Watchung Mountains are known for their numerous scenic vistas overlooking New York City, Newark and New Jersey skylines, as well as their isolated ecosystems containing rare plants, endangered wildlife, rich minerals, and globally imperiled trap rock glade communities.Joseph Dowhan et al. Significant Habitats and Habitat Complexes of the New York Bight Watershed. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1997. Available via the US FWS National Conservation Training Center.Glenn, Steven. Field trip reports ‚Äì Garret Mountain Reservation. The Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society 135(1):149‚Äì153. Jan/Feb 2008. Available via BNET The ridges traditionally contained the westward spread of urbanization, forming a significant geologic barrier beyond the piedmont west of the Hudson River; the town of Newark, for example, once included lands from the Hudson to the base of the mountains. Later treaties moved the boundary to the top of the mountain, to include the springs. The Watchungs are basalt uplifts, geologically similar to the Palisades along the Hudson river. In many places, however, the mountains have become sinuous islands of natural landscape within the suburban sprawl covering much of contemporary northeastern New Jersey. Parks, preserves, and numerous historical sites dot the valleys and slopes of the mountains, providing recreational and cultural activities to one of the most densely populated regions of the nation. Geography The two most prominent ridges, known as First Watchung Mountain (the southeastern ridge) and Second Watchung Mountain (the northwestern ridge), stretch for over forty miles (64 km) from Somerville (in Somerset County) in the southwest through Morris County, Union County, Essex County, and Passaic County to Mahwah (in Bergen County) in the northeast. The less prominent and discontinuous ridge formed by Long Hill, Riker Hill, Hook Mountain, and Packanack Mountain is sometimes referred to as Third Watchung Mountain and lies on the northwestern side of Second Watchung Mountain. The entireties of First Watchung Mountain and Second Watchung Mountain are often erroneously referred to as Orange Mountain and Preakness Mountain. Historically, the names ‚ÄòOrange‚Äô and ‚ÄòPreakness‚Äô have only been applied to specific sections of these ridges.Thomas Francis Gordon. Gazetteer of the State of New Jersey ‚Äì A General View of its Physical and Moral Condition, together with a Topographical and Statistical Account of its Counties, Towns, Villages, Canals, Railroads, &c.; Published by D. Fenton, 1834. See Page 8. Available via Internet ArchiveKelsey, Frederick W. The First County Park System: A Complete History of the Inception and Development of the Essex County Parks of New Jersey. J.S. Ogilvie Publishing Co., New York, 1905. See Page 40. Available via Internet Archive The confusion appears to have arisen from the fact that First Watchung Mountain is said to be composed of Orange Mountain basalt, while Second Watchung Mountain is composed of Preakness Mountain basalt. The names applied to the basalts are actually geologic type localities, that is to say, the type of rock found at Orange Mountain is exclusive to all of First Watchung Mountain, while the type of rock found at Preakness Mountain is exclusive to all of Second Watchung Mountain. Like First and Second Watchung Mountain, Third Watchung Mountain is sometimes confused with its type locality, as its entire length is erroneously referred to as Hook Mountain on some occasions. In addition to the three main ridges of the Watchungs, a smaller fourth ridge exists south of Morristown and west of Third Watchung Mountain. While attaining elevations over above sea level, the ridge lacks topographic prominence, only rising to about above the surrounding terrain. Only one portion of the ridge is named, a southern section underlying Harding Township known as Lees Hill. All of the ridges lie to the east of the higher Appalachian Mountains, which in northern New Jersey are often referred to as the New York - New Jersey Highlands. Together with the Appalachian Mountains to the west, the Watchungs pen in an area formerly occupied by the prehistoric Glacial Lake Passaic. The Great Swamp, a large portion of which is designated as the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, is a remnant of this lake, presently retained by Third Watchung Mountain. Although the Watchungs commonly are described in terms of their east-west ridge arrangement (First, Second, and Third Watchung Mountain), they also are divided into smaller mountain ranges, as well as various named ridges. Ranges and ridges of the Watchungs The notable ranges and ridges of the Watchungs from north to south include: *Campgaw Mountain is the northernmost ridge of the Watchungs, formed by a combination of First and Second Watchung Mountain. Its northern terminus is the Ramapo Mountains, near the New York border. A shallow gap separates its southern end from Preakness Mountain and Goffle Hill. *Preakness Mountain comprises part of the northern extent of Second Watchung Mountain between the Passaic River and Campgaw Mountain. Along with Packanack Mountain (part of Third Watchung Mountain) to the west, Preakness Mountain forms the Preakness Range. The three highest peaks of the Watchungs are located in this range. *Goffle Hill (Totoway Mountain hist.), part of First Watchung Mountain, flanks the eastern side of Preakness Mountain. Its northern end is broken by a shallow gap separating it from Campgaw Mountain, while its southern end is divided from Garret Mountain by the Passaic River in Paterson. *Third Watchung Mountain begins with Packanack Mountain, part of the Preakness Range. The Pompton River separates the south end of Pakanack from the beginning of Towakhow Mountain or Hook Mountain, which runs west-northwest and then turns south to form a curve encircling the Great Piece Meadows along the Passaic River, ending near Pine Brook. To the south, the Rockaway, Whippany, and Passaic Rivers flow east through a gap in the range, which resumes south of Beaufort, New Jersey as Riker Hill. The Passaic flows west through another gap north of Chatham, below which Long Hill stretches southwest and then west to Millington, where the Passaic drains the Great Swamp and cuts through the range. Third Watchung extends a short distance west of Millington to Liberty Corner, with a spur, Cedar Hill, jutting northeast at Lyons. *The Newark Mountains are a historical range, encompassing the ridges of First and Second Watchung Mountain south of the Passaic River. First Watchung Mountain in this range begins in the north as Garret Mountain. South of Garret Mountain is Orange Mountain, which is separated from Garret Mountain by a gap known as the Great Notch. The Hobart Gap (or Millburn Gap), near Springfield, then divides Orange Mountain from the remaining southern part of First Watchung Mountain, which stretches south and then west before terminating near Far Hills. Second Watchung Mountain begins in the north of the Newark Mountains as what is historically known as Caldwell Mountain. The northern terminus of Caldwell Mountain is the Passaic River, while the southern terminus is at the Hobart/Millburn Gap. South of the gap, Second Watchung Mountain parallels First Watchung Mountain to Far Hills. There, a gap known as Moggy Hollow incises the ridge before it makes a turn to the north. The remaining section of Second Watchung Mountain, known as Pill Hill, then continues a short distance before terminating along the Ramapo Mountains. Noteworthy summits of the Watchungs include High Mountain, Beech Mountain, and Mount Cecchino in Wayne, which stand at 879 ft (268m), 869 ft (265m) and 755 ft (230m) above sea level. Another notable summit is The Hilltop in Verona, Cedar Grove, and North Caldwell, which peaks at just east of the water sphere. History Trees in the Watchung Reservation between the first and second ridges near Summit and Mountainside The original inhabitants of the Watchungs, the Lenape, referred to the mountains as the Wach Unks, or ‚Äòhigh hills‚Äô.U.S. Geological Survey - NYC Regional Geology, Newark BasinMatters Magazine ‚Äì South Mountain High Evidence of the Lenape presence in the Watchungs can be seen in numerous camps sites that have been uncovered, mainly along the rivers coursing through mountains and in the small caves abundant in the volcanic rock. It is thought the Lenape favored the Watchungs for their profusion of natural resources, including abundant freshwater rivers and streams, a variety of forests, and plentiful fish and game.Henry B. K√ºmmel. Geological Survey of New Jersey ‚Äì Bulletin 6: Annual Administrative Report of the State Geologist for the year 1911. MacCrellish and Quigley, Printers, Trenton, NJ, 1912. See Page 77, Archaeological Survey, Sites in Northern New Jersey. Available via Google Books The Lenape Trail goes along the edge of the cliffs, and used the overlooks there as smoke signal locations. They also took advantage of the rich soils and maintained many farm areas where they raised a variety of seasonal crops. With the arrival of Europeans, the same resources that sustained the indigenous peoples served settlers. Trade in furs to European markets, a bounty of game and fish, and native garden produce for the traders was important during the Dutch colonial period when few settlements occurred. Perhaps most importantly with the settlements established during the English colonial period, the rivers and streams of the Watchungs also supported grain, grist, and saw mills. Later, the energy of these rivers would be harnessed for industry, most notably at the Great Falls of the Passaic River, where mechanical and hydroelectric systems exploited the energy of water falling over the face of First Watchung Mountain. Washington Valley in Bridgewater between the first and second ridge Outside of providing gradation to rivers and streams, the height of the Watchungs has proven useful for other reasons. In the French and Indian War, the military reused the Lenape signal points, as did Washington later. *During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington used the protection of the Watchung mountains to erect the first and second Middlebrook encampments in the Washington Valley between the ridges. This position on the high ground also allowed him to monitor the area between Perth Amboy and New Brunswick as well as to identify and disturb British movements between Manhattan and Philadelphia.The Papers of George Washington: Revolutionary War Series volume 10, June ‚Äì August 1777 , accessed October 18, 2006 During the revolution the signaling beacons along the Watchungs were extended far up the Hudson and to Boston. *In the twentieth century, the Hilltop in Verona, the highest point in Essex County, served as the site of a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients. The county hospital was built there because the high elevation provided clean, mountain air away from the cities to the east. *At the height of the Cold War, Campgaw Mountain was selected to house a Nike missile base. Installed on the mountain between 1955 and 1971, the base's missiles served to guard New York City air space, standing by to intercept nuclear armed Soviet bombers. The facility ultimately was abandoned with the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles.Bergen County Historical Society ‚Äì Cold War at Campgaw Mountain Two other missile sites were nestled into the forests atop peaks in Mountainside and Morris Township, creating a triangle of redundant sites. Geology 200 million years ago, magma intruded into the Newark Basin, then an active rift basin associated with the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea.U.S. Geological Survey - NYC Regional Geology, Mesozoic Basins The magma was initially contained within the sedimentary strata of the basin, forming large intrusions like the Palisades Sill, but it ultimately broke out to the surface through large, episodic eruptions.Puffer, J.H., Block, K.A., Steiner, J.C., 2009. Transmission of Flood Basalts through a Shallow Crustal Sill and the Correlation of Sill Layers with Extrusive Flows: The Palisades Intrusive System and the Basalts of the Newark Basin, New Jersey, U.S.A. The Journal of Geology, volume 117, p. 139‚Äì155. The Watchung Mountains were originally formed from these eruptions, consisting of three separate flood basalts that may have filled nearly the entire Newark Basin. Each time the basin filled with basalt, which cooled into blocky trap rock, a period of limited volcanic activity followed, allowing sediment to be deposited on top of the previously erupted layer of basalt. In this way, the Newark Basin became layered with alternating strata of Watchung basalt and Jurassic sedimentary rock. Throughout the early Jurassic, the Newark Basin underwent extensive dipping and folding. The western side of the basin plunged deeper into the crust, tilting the basin's strata to an angle of between 5 and 25 degrees. Localized deformation of the western edge of the basin along the Ramapo Fault System formed alternating synclines and anticlines that warped the layers of basalt and sedimentary rock.LeTourneau, Peter M. & Olsen, Paul E. (editors). ‚ÄúThe Great Rift Valleys of Pangea in Eastern North America ‚Äì Volume One: Tectonics Structure and Volcanism‚Äù. Columbia University Press, New York, 2003. . Limited Preview available via Google Books. USGS cross-section of the Newark Basin Erosion began to attack the basin as rifting failed and deposition of new sediments ceased. Over millions of years, erosion ate downward through the tilted rock of the basin, eventually encountering the basalt layers, which are significantly more erosion resistant than the surrounding sedimentary rock. The result of this has been that the exposed edges of the eroding basalt layers have managed to persist longer than the exposed edges of the sedimentary layers, causing them to project prominently above the surrounding surface terrain as high ridges.Kummel, Henry B. Annual Report of the State Geologist for the year 1898 ‚Äì The Extension of the Newark System of Rocks. MacCrellish & Quigley, State Printers, Trenton, NJ, 1899. See Pages 47. Available via Google Books Today, the flood basalts are preserved in the synclines adjacent to the Ramapo Fault system. It is in these synclines that the basalt layers are thick and warped into downward dipping trap rock sheets, descending below the current erosional surface of the basin. Notably, the synclines preserve not only the basalt layers, but also some overlying Jurassic sedimentary rock. The largest syncline in the basin, the Watchung syncline, contains the greater portion of the Watchung flood basalts as they appear today. The projecting, eroding edges of the flood basalts preserved in the syncline form the three ridges of the Watchung Mountains. Jurassic sedimentary rock layers between and above the ridges form the Feltville, Towaco and Boonton formations. Elsewhere in the Newark Basin, smaller synclines preserve the Watchung Outliers, additional fragments of the flood basalts and associated overlying sediments that have survived into the modern era. Because the majority of the Watchung Mountains are composed of extrusive igneous trap rock, they display characteristic columnar jointing and stacked lava flows. These features are readily noted along the eastern faces of the ridges, which often present mural precipices, or vertical escarpments. Similar features can also be seen in the Palisades Sill, although these were formed within the Earth's crust. Additionally, the Watchungs feature not only blocky aa lava, but also ropey and billowing pahoehoe flows. Water flows over a trap rock surface in the Watchungs The magma which generated the Watchungs and the Palisades also formed the intrusive igneous Sourland Mountain in Central New Jersey, as well as a series of smaller outlying volcanic ridges in the region. Cushetunk Mountain, a ring- shaped volcanic mountain between Sourland Mountain and the Watchungs, is of the same geologic lineage. The Metacomet Mountains in the Connecticut River Basin, another aborted rift valley, came into existence around the same time as the Watchungs, also through extrusive eruptions. While non-contiguous, the two ranges may be considered geologic cousins, having formed under similar circumstances during the rifting of Pangaea. The same erosive and tectonic forces which elevated the Watchungs also served to raise the Metacomets. Mineralogy The Watchungs are composed principally of volcanic basalt, which historically has been used in railroad beds and road construction. In addition to this, in many places the mountains are underlain by red and white sandstone which has at times been used in building construction. Mica and calcareous spar often accompany these sandstone beds. An ancient lava front in the Watchungs bearing embedded agate and quartz nodules Due to the volcanic nature of the Watchungs, zeolites, including prehnite, analcime, and stilbite, which form from a reaction of mafic rocks in alkaline environments, can be found along exposed ridge lines. Agate, primarily in the form of chalcedony, and crystalline quartz (sometimes in the form of amethyst), are prominent in the ancient lava flows of the Watchungs and are typically seen as embedded nodules along exposed fronts. Datolite, another nodular mineral, has been found embedded in the volcanic rock around the Great Falls. Additionally, jasper and satin spar are known to exist within the northwestern Preakness Range.Pierce, James.

Fenton, 1834. Available via Internet Archive Copper also can be found in the Watchungs. Near Belleville, ore containing 8% copper was discovered, and a copper mine once operated in the area. Other copper bearing ores have been noted near Paterson. These ores typically contain cuprite (red copper oxide) and/or copper carbonate in a matrix of red or gray sandstone. Pyritous copper, also known as chalcopyrite, is not known to exist in ores found in the Watchungs. Conservation A trap rock glade straddles the summit of First Watchung Mountain In the mid- twentieth century, the ability of the Watchungs to hold back the spread of urbanization was greatly reduced with the development of the interstate highway system. Three interstate highways, I-80, I-280, and I-78, were sliced through the Watchungs, allowing suburbia to invade its inner valleys and slopes. Near the end of the century, I-287, a great semi-circular beltway enclosed the Watchungs within the bulge of suburbia radiating out from New York City. Many pathways of safe passage through the mountains, retained from the time of the Lenapes, were severed and blocked by the highways. Today, along the summits of the Watchungs, talus slope environs as well as globally rare trap rock glade/outcrop communities and their unique species have become threatened by development. As a response, efforts to conserve the unique landscapes of the Watchungs have been undertaken. The largest of the conservation efforts so far is High Mountain Park Preserve, which at sets aside one of the largest tracts of wilderness in the New Jersey Piedmont. The park is known to contain at least one globally imperiled plant, Torrey's mountain mint (Pycnanthemum torrei), as well as three other plants endangered within New Jersey.The Nature Conservancy - High Mountain Park Preserve Other large areas of preserved land lie within the valleys of the Watchungs. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, retained within the embrace of Third Watchung Mountain, now consists of 7,600 acres (31 km2) or almost 12 square miles (30.4 km¬≤) of varied habitats. The refuge was created through the efforts and donations of a small group of local residents in 1959, the Jersey Jetport Site Association, and a Great Swamp Committee later formed within the North American Wildlife Foundation. It is championed by many organizations among the contemporary communities adjacent to the refuge. The Great Swamp, as well as other swamps retained by the Watchungs, including Great Piece Meadows, constitute the remains of Glacial Lake Passaic. The lake existed during the last ice age, eventually draining as a glacier in the northern Watchungs receded and allowed the lake's water to empty out via a gap in the ridges of First and Second Watchung Mountain currently occupied by the Passaic River. General awareness of the history and natural environment of Watchungs has been increased through efforts such as the construction and designation of the Lenape Trail. The trail traverses rugged sections of the mountains while at the same time connecting various historical sites pertinent to the history of New Jersey.Lenape Trail ‚Äì New Jersey‚Äôs Most Remarkable Walking Trail Recreation Map showing details of Watchung Reservation Parks and reservations from north to south: *Campgaw Mountain Reservation, Campgaw Mountain (First and Second Watchung Mountain) *Franklin Lakes Nature Preserve, Goffle Hill (First Watchung Mountain) *High Mountain Park Preserve, Preakness Range (Second Watchung Mountain) *Great Falls State Park Under Development, First Watchung Mountain *Garret Mountain Reservation, First Watchung Mountain *Rifle Camp Park, First Watchung Mountain *Mills Reservation, First Watchung Mountain *Hilltop Reservation, Second Watchung Mountain *Eagle Rock Reservation, First Watchung Mountain *Riker Hill Park, Riker Hill (Third Watchung Mountain) *Lenape Trail, First, Second, and Third Watchung Mountain *South Mountain Reservation, First and Second Watchung Mountain *Watchung Reservation, First and Second Watchung Mountain *Washington Rock State Park, First Watchung Mountain *Washington Valley Park, First Watchung Mountain *Leonard J.

The Cumberland Plateau is the southern part of the Appalachian Plateau in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It includes much of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, and portions of northern Alabama and northwest Georgia.Appalachian Plateau Geologic Province, New Georgia Encyclopedia, The University of Georgia Press The terms \\"Allegheny Plateau\\" and the \\"Cumberland Plateau\\" both refer to the dissected plateau lands lying west of the main Appalachian Mountains. The terms stem from historical usage rather than geological difference, so there is no strict dividing line between the two. Two major rivers share the names of the plateaus, with the Allegheny River rising in the Allegheny Plateau and the Cumberland River rising in the Cumberland Plateau in Harlan County, Kentucky.  Geography  The Cumberland Plateau is a deeply dissected plateau, with topographic relief commonly of about , and frequent sandstone outcroppings and bluffs. At Kentucky's Pottsville Escarpment, which is the transition from the Cumberland Plateau to the Bluegrass in the north and the Pennyrile in the south, there are many spectacular cliffs, gorges, rockhouses, natural bridges, and waterfalls. In Tennessee, the Cumberland Plateau's western border is the Highland Rim east of the Nashville Basin, and its eastern edge is marked by Walden Ridge, which continues south into Alabama as Sand Mountain. Walden Ridge and Sand Mountain are separated from the main portion of the Cumberland Plateau by the Sequatchie Valley, which extends into central Alabama under other names. In Kentucky, the height of the plateau's hills increases from northwest to southeast, with the westernmost areas of the plateau having a relief of around 200 feet and an appearance similar to the knobs region, whereas areas near Black Mountain have a relief exceeding 2,500 feet.  Geology and physiography  The Cumberland Plateau is a physiographic section of the larger Appalachian Plateau province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. The Cumberland Plateau is a physiographic province in the Appalachian region that rises about 1000 feet above the surrounding areas in the region (Tennessee Vacation, 2018). The rough topography that makes up the Cumberland Plateau has caused a development of isolated settlements and the local economies based on subsistence agriculture (Britannica, 2016). The Cumberland Plateau is contiguous with the Allegheny Plateau on the northern side, the only real difference being local naming. The sedimentary rocks that compose both plateaus are of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian geological age, composed of near-shore sediments washed westward from the old Appalachian Mountains. Some rock layers were laid down in shallow coastal waters, some, including bituminous coal seams were laid onshore in swampy environments. These are interlaced with delta formations of cross-bedded sandstones and occasionally conglomerate. There are numerous discontinuities in the beds, where they were raised high enough to be eroded, then lowered to have more sediments added on top. Near the Cumberland Falls, 400 feet below the top of the formation, going by the age of the bedrock which has moved less than a tenth of an inch for the last 300 million years caused mainly by lateral erosion of the plateau.  Natural history and conservation  The plateau contains some of the largest stretches of contiguous forest in the eastern United States. Regionally, forests are intermediate between oak (Quercus) and hickory (Carya) forest types with pines (Pinus) occurring on dry, upland sites and mesophytic species occurring in protected coves. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory is involved with the conservation of the mixed mesophytic forests within the Northern Cumberland Plateau.ORNL Report: Druckenbrod, D.L. and V.H. Dale. 2004.

These include the names of a few thousand asteroids and hundreds of comets. Also, many topological features on solar system bodies have been named after people, including many hundreds of craters on the Moon, Mars and other planets and satellites. In addition to craters there are also various other topological features such as mountains, valleys, ridges on the Moon and other bodies which are also named after people. Finally, several stars are named after people (according to the IAU), such as Barnard's star (Star-registry companies keep lists of stars they claim to have named after people. The IAU does not recognize those claims.). There's also a number of Deep-Sky objects named after astronomers and scientists. The list below shows most of them.

A conservative Democrat, McDonald was active in numerous civic organizations and maintained one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. He was known for his staunch opposition to communism. He was the second president of the John Birch Society. Early life and career Larry McDonald was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, more specifically in the eastern part of the city that is in DeKalb County. General George S. Patton was a distant relation. As a child, he attended several private and parochial schools before attending a non- denominational high school. He spent two years at high school before graduating in 1951. He studied at Davidson College from 1951-53, spending time studying history. He entered the Emory University School of Medicine at the age of 17, graduating in 1957. He interned at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. He trained as a urologist at the University of Michigan Hospital under Prof. Reed M. Nesbit. Following completion in 1966 he returned to Atlanta and entered practice with his father. From 1959 to 1961, he served as a flight surgeon in the United States Navy stationed at the Keflav√≠k naval base in Iceland. McDonald married an Icelandic national, Anna Tryggvadottir, with whom he would eventually have three children: Tryggvi Paul, Callie Grace, and Mary Elizabeth. It was in Iceland that McDonald first began to take note of communism. He felt the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik was doing things advantageous to the Communists; therefore he went to his commanding officer, but was told he did not understand the big picture. After his tour of service he practiced medicine at the McDonald Urology Clinic in Atlanta. He took an increasing interest in politics, reading books on political history and foreign policy. He joined the John Birch Society‚Äîa conservative, anti- communist organization ‚Äî in 1966 or 1967.International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors \\"Lawrence 'Larry' Patton McDonald\\", March 10, 2009; retrieved January 21, 2010. His passionate preoccupation with politics led to a divorce from his first wife. McDonald made one unsuccessful run for Congress in 1972 before being elected in 1974. In 1975, he married Kathryn Jackson, whom he met while giving a speech in California. McDonald served as a member on the Georgia State Medical Education Board and as chairman from 1969 to 1974. Political career In 1974, McDonald ran for Congress against incumbent John W. Davis in the Democratic primary as a conservative who was opposed to mandatory federal school integration programs. McDonald criticized Davis for being one of only two Georgia congressmen to vote in favor of school busing. He also attacked Davis for receiving thousands of dollars in political donations from out-of-state groups which he said favored mandatory federal programs that used busing to achieve school integration. McDonald won the primary election in a surprise upset and was elected in November 1974 to the 94th United States Congress, serving Georgia's 7th congressional district, which included most of Atlanta's northwestern suburbs (including Marietta), where opposition to school busing was especially high. However, during the general election, J. Quincy Collins Jr., an Air Force prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, running as a Republican, nearly defeated him, despite the poor performance of Republicans nationally that year due to the aftereffects of the Watergate scandal. However, McDonald would never face another contest nearly that close. McDonald, who considered himself a traditional Democrat \\"cut from the cloth of Jefferson and Jackson\\", was known for his conservative views, even by Southern Democratic standards of the time. In fact, one scoring method published in the American Journal of Political Science named him the second most conservative member of either chamber of Congress between 1937 and 2002 (behind only Ron Paul). Even though many of McDonald's constituents had begun splitting their tickets and voting Republican at the federal level as early as the 1960s, the GOP was still well behind the Democrats at the local level, and conservative Democrats like McDonald continued to hold most state and local offices well into the 1990s. The American Conservative Union gave him a perfect score of 100 every year he was in the House of Representatives, except in 1978, when he scored a 95.ACU Ratings of Congress: House Ratings: 1976, 1977 , 1978 , 1979 , 1980 , 1981 , 1982 , 1983 ; retrieved 2009-08-26. He also scored \\"perfect or near perfect ratings\\" on the congressional scorecards of the National Right to Life Committee, Gun Owners of America, and the American Security Council. McDonald was referred to by The New American as \\"the leading anti-Communist in Congress\\". McDonald admired Senator Joseph McCarthy and was a member of the Joseph McCarthy Foundation. He took the communist threat seriously and considered it an international conspiracy. An admirer of Austrian economics and a member of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, he was an advocate of tight monetary policy in the late 1970s to get the economy out of stagflation, and advocated returning to the gold standard.\\"Five Myths About the Gold Standard\\" by Rep. Larry McDonald and Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). Congressional Record, Vol. 127, No. 28; February 23, 1981; retrieved January 21, 2010. McDonald called the welfare state a \\"disaster\\". YouTube; retrieved 2009-08-26. and favored phasing control of the Great Society programs over to the states to operate and run. He also favored cuts to foreign aid, saying, \\"To me, foreign aid is an area that you not only can cut but you could take a chainsaw to in terms of reductions.\\" McDonald co- sponsored a resolution \\"expressing the sense of the Congress that homosexual acts and the class of individuals who advocate such conduct shall never receive special consideration or a protected status under law\\". He advocated the use of the non-approved drug laetrile to treat patients in advanced stages of cancer despite medical opinion that the promotion of laetrile to treat cancer was a canonical example of quackery. McDonald also opposed the establishment of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, saying the FBI had evidence that King \\"was associated with and being manipulated by communists and secret communist agents\\". A firearms enthusiast and game hunter, McDonald allegedly had \\"about 200\\" guns at his official district residence. In 1979, with John Rees and Major General John K. Singlaub, McDonald founded the Western Goals Foundation. According to The Spokesman-Review, it was intended to \\"blunt subversion, terrorism, and communism\\" by filling the gap \\"created by the disbanding of the House Un-American Activities Committee and what [McDonald] considered to be the crippling of the FBI during the 1970s\\". McDonald became the second president of the John Birch Society in 1983, succeeding Robert Welch. McDonald rarely spoke on the House floor, preferring to insert material into the Congressional Record. These insertions typically dealt with foreign policy issues relating to the Soviet Union and domestic issues centered on the growth of non-Soviet and Soviet sponsored leftist subversion. A number of McDonald's insertions relating to the Socialist Workers Party were collected into a book, Trotskyism and Terror: The Strategy of Revolution, published in 1977.Evans, M. Stanton (1977). Introduction. Trotskyism and Terror: The Strategy of Revolution. By Larry McDonald. Washington, D.C.: ACU Education and Research Institute. pp. 2‚Äì3. During his time in Congress, McDonald introduced over 150 bills, including legislation to: * Repeal the Gun Control Act of 1968. * Remove the limitation upon the amount of outside income a Social Security recipient may earn. * Award honorary U.S. Citizenship to Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. * Invite Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to address a joint meeting of Congress. * Prohibit Federal funds from being used to finance the purchase of American agricultural commodities by any Communist country. * Create a select committee in the House of Representatives to conduct an investigation of human rights abuses in Southeast Asia by Communist forces. * Repeal the FCC regulations against editorializing and support of political candidates by noncommercial educational broadcasting stations. * Create a House Committee on Internal Security. * Impeach UN Ambassador Andrew Young. * Limit eligibility for appointment and admission to any United States service academy to men. * Direct the Comptroller General of the United States to audit the gold held by the United States annually. * Increase the national speed limit to from the then-prevailing national speed limit of . * Abolish the Federal Election Commission. * Get the U.S. out of the United Nations. * Place statues of Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver in the Capitol.Representative Lawrence P. McDonald (1935 - 1983) at Congress.gov. Death McDonald was invited to South Korea to attend a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the United States‚ÄìSouth Korea Mutual Defense Treaty with three fellow members of Congress, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Senator Steve Symms of Idaho, and Representative Carroll Hubbard of Kentucky. Due to bad weather on Sunday, August 28, 1983, McDonald's flight from Atlanta was diverted to Baltimore and when he finally arrived at JFK Airport in New York, he had missed his connection to South Korea by two or three minutes. McDonald could have boarded a Pan Am Boeing 747 flight to Seoul, but he preferred the lower fares of Korean Air Lines and chose to wait for the next KAL flight two days later. Simultaneously, Hubbard and Helms planned to meet with McDonald to discuss how to join McDonald on the KAL 007 flight. As the delays mounted, instead of joining McDonald, Hubbard at the last minute gave up on the trip, canceled his reservations, and accepted a Kentucky speaking engagement while Helms attempted to join McDonald but was also delayed. McDonald occupied an aisle seat, 02B in the first class section, when KAL 007 took off on August 31 at 12:24 AM local time, on a trip to Anchorage, Alaska for a scheduled stopover seven hours later. The plane remained on the ground for an hour and a half during which it was refueled, reprovisioned, cleaned, and serviced. The passengers were given the option of leaving the aircraft but McDonald remained on the plane, catching up on his sleep. Helms meanwhile had managed to arrive and invited McDonald to move onto his flight, KAL 015, but McDonald did not wish to be disturbed. With a fresh flight crew, KAL 007 took off at 4 AM local time for its scheduled non-stop flight over the Pacific to Seoul's Kimpo International Airport, a nearly flight that would take approximately eight hours. On September 1, 1983, McDonald and the rest of the passengers and crew of KAL 007 were killed when Soviet fighters, under the command of Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, shot down KAL 007 near Moneron Island after the plane entered Soviet airspace. Some families of the victims of the shootdown maintain that there is reason to believe that McDonald and others of Flight 007 survived the shootdown. This viewpoint has received some coverage in the conservative news agency Accuracy in Media and also the New American, the magazine of the John Birch Society. Aftermath After McDonald's death, a special election was held to fill his seat in Congress. Former Governor Lester Maddox stated his intention to run for the seat if McDonald's widow, Kathy McDonald, did not. Kathy McDonald did decide to run, but lost to George \\"Buddy\\" Darden. =Tribute= There is a cenotaph placed for him at Crest Lawn Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia. On March 18, 1998, the Georgia House of Representatives, \\"to preserve the memory of the sacrifice and service of this able and outstanding Georgian and recognize his service to the people of his district\\", named the portion of Interstate 75, which runs from the Chattahoochee River northward to the Tennessee state line in his honor, the Larry McDonald Memorial Highway.

He became the second Dutch citizen, third Dutch-born and fifth Dutch-speaking astronaut upon launch of Soyuz TMA-4 on 19 April 2004. Kuipers returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-3 11 days later. Kuipers is the first Dutch astronaut to return to space. On 5 August 2009, Dutch minister of economic affairs Maria van der Hoeven, announced Kuipers was selected as an astronaut for International Space Station (ISS) Expeditions 30 and 31. He was launched to space on 21 December 2011 and returned to Earth on 1 July 2012. Personal life and education Andr√© Kuipers was born on 5 October 1958 in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. He graduated from high school in Amsterdam in 1977, and received a medical degree from the University of Amsterdam in 1987. He is married and has three daughters and a son. When interviewed about his youth, Kuipers stated that he dreamed of becoming an astronaut ever since he was a teenager. His dreams became reality when he was selected to the European Astronaut Corps in 1998. Space flight experience Kuipers has flown two space missions: first the DELTA mission in 2004. In May 2009, he served as the backup of Belgian astronaut Frank de Winne, who later became the Expedition 21 commander, during the later part of his six-month mission. On 21 December 2011, Kuipers was launched for his second spaceflight PromISSe on Expedition 30 and Expedition 31. He returned to Earth on 1 July 2012. =DELTA Mission= Launch and docking Using the Soyuz TMA-4, mounted atop a Soyuz-FG rocket, Kuipers and his fellow cosmonauts Gennady Padalka (Russia) and Michael Fincke (USA) rocketed towards the ISS in the early morning of 19 April 2004. The spacecraft flawlessly docked to the ISS two days later. Experiments As part of his DELTA mission, Kuipers conducted 21 experiments in orbit on a wide range of subjects: physiology, biology, microbiology, medicine, technological development, physics and Earth observation. One of the experiments in the field of technological development was related to the development of more energy-efficient lighting. The so- called Arges project, of which Kuipers' experiment formed a part, was commissioned by Eindhoven University of Technology and Philips Electronics. Maybe the best-known experiment involved plant growth: Seeds in Space. Kuipers cooperated with primary school children in the Netherlands to compare results of plant growth from orbit with those from Earth. Landing Kuipers looking at Earth from the International Space Station in 2004 Padalka and Fincke remained on board the ISS for six months, as the Expedition 9 crew. Kuipers returned to Earth nearly eleven days after launch on 30 April, joined by departing ISS crew members Alexander Kaleri (Russia) and Michael Foale (US), who thereby ended their six-month stay on board the ISS. =Expedition 30/31= Kuipers experimenting with a water drop in weightlessness in 2012 On 26 November 2008, Dutch minister of economic affairs Maria van der Hoeven pushed for a second, six-month mission for Kuipers in 2011. In the same speech, she said she would support the ISS project with an extra \\"few\\" million euros. After a call with ESA director general Jean-Jacques Dordain on 4 August 2009, Maria van der Hoeven confirmed on 5 August that Kuipers would be making a second space flight, starting in December 2011. Kuipers was the first astronaut to be selected for ISS Expeditions 30 and 31. Kuipers launched on 21 December 2011 on the Soyuz TMA-03M flight with his two fellow crew members Cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko from the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos, and Don Pettit from NASA.

The township was named after legendary Welsh prince Madoc ap Owain Gwynedd, credited by some with discovering North America in 1170. There exists an alternative explanation, for which no evidence exists, that the name comes from a small Welsh village, Llanmadoc on the Gower Peninsula of Wales, not far from the city of Swansea. Its post office dates from 1836. Communities The township of Madoc comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Allen, Bannockburn, Cooper, Eldorado, Fox Corners, Hazzards Corners, Keller Bridge, Rimington; Empey File:Eldorado ON.JPGEldorado (2010) File:Bannockburn ON.JPGBannockburn History Eldorado (circa 1900) Mills and ironworks gave initial stimulus to the community of Madoc. Following the discovery of gold-bearing quartz in 1866, the community prospered as an industrial centre.

The CT scan shows a pulmonary contusion (red arrow) accompanied by a rib fracture (purple arrow). In medicine, a disease is considered asymptomatic if a patient is a carrier for a disease or infection but experiences no symptoms. A condition might be asymptomatic if it fails to show the noticeable symptoms with which it is usually associated. Asymptomatic infections are also called subclinical infections. Other diseases (such as mental illnesses) might be considered subclinical if they present some but not all of the symptoms required for a clinical diagnosis. The term clinically silent is also used. Knowing that a condition is asymptomatic is important because: * It may develop symptoms later and only then require treatment. * It may resolve itself or become benign. * It may be contagious * It is not required that a person undergo treatment. It does not cause later medical problems such as high blood pressure and hyperlipidaemia. * Be alert to possible problems: asymptomatic hypothyroidism makes a person vulnerable to Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome or beri-beri following intravenous glucose. An example of an asymptomatic disease is Cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is a member of the herpes virus. \\"It is estimated that 1% of all newborns are infected with CMV, but the majority of infections are asymptomatic.\\" (Knox, 1983; Kumar et al. 1984)Vinson, B. (2012). Language Disorders Across the Lifespan. p. 94. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar In some diseases, the proportion of asymptomatic cases can be important. For example, in multiple sclerosis it is estimated that around 25% of the cases are asymptomatic, being these cases detected postmortem or just by coincidence (as incidental findings) while treating other diseases. Conditions Asymptomatic conditions may not be discovered until the patient undergoes medical tests (X-rays or other investigations). Some people may remain asymptomatic for a remarkably long period of time; such as people with some forms of cancer. If a patient is asymptomatic, precautionary steps are ineffective and should not be taken. The patient should continue to seek treatment for the main disease they are suffering from currently. A patient's individual genetic makeup may delay or prevent the onset of symptoms. Some diseases are defined only clinically, like AIDS being the result of HIV infection. Therefore, it makes no sense to speak about \\"asymptomatic AIDS\\". This concept of clinically defined diseases is related in some way to the concept of syndrome.

In 1917, the Conservative Party recruited Stewart, then a young lawyer, to be the party's candidate in a by-election in King's County. Stewart won the vote and took his seat in the provincial legislative assembly. In 1921 he was elected leader of the Conservative Party and led the party to victory in the 1923 election but his government was defeated in the 1927 election due to Stewart's opposition to total prohibition of alcohol. He remained party leader and defeated the Liberal government in the 1931 election thanks, in part, to the difficulty all incumbent governments had in dealing with the Great Depression. Stewart took on several cabinet positions himself and also intensively lobbied the federal government for relief so the province could deal with the economic hardships Prince Edward Islanders were suffering during the Depression. He obtained a larger federal subsidy for the island but the workload had a toll on Stewart and he died in office in 1933 at the age of 59. 1874 births 1933 deaths People from Kings County, Prince Edward Island Premiers of Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island MLAs Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island leaders Prince of Wales College alumni Dalhousie University alumni ","title":"James David Stewart"},{"id":"602808","text":"The polar archipelago of Svalbard was first discovered by Willem Barentsz in 1596, although there is disputed evidence of use by Pomors or Norsemen. Whaling for bowhead whales started in 1611, dominated by English and Dutch companies, though other countries participated. At that time there was no agreement about sovereignty. Whaling stations, the largest being Smeerenburg, were built during the 17th century, but gradually whaling decreased. Hunting was carried out from the 17th century by Pomors, but from the 19th century it became more dominated by Norwegians. Exploration was initially conducted to find new whaling grounds, but from the 18th century some scientific expeditions took place. These were initially large scale, but from the late 19th century they became smaller and increasingly focused on the interior. The most important scientific explorers were Baltazar Mathias Keilhau, Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld and Martin Conway. Sustainable mining started in 1906 with the establishment of Longyearbyen and by the 1920s, permanent coal mining settlements had been established at Barentsburg, Grumant, Pyramiden, Svea and Ny-√Ölesund. The Svalbard Treaty came into effect in 1925, granting Norway sovereignty of the archipelago, but prohibiting \\"warlike activities\\" and establishing all signatories the right to mine. This both eliminated the mare liberum status of the islands, and also saw a name change from the Spitsbergen Archipelago to Svalbard. By the 1930s, all settlements were either Norwegian or Soviet. During the Second World War, the settlements were first evacuated and then bombed by the Kriegsmarine, but rebuilt after the war. During the Cold War there were increased tensions between Norway and the Soviet Union, particularly regarding the building of an airport. There was limited oil drilling, and by 1973 more than half the archipelago was protected. Starting in the 1970s, Longyearbyen underwent a process of \\"normalization\\" to become a regular community. Arktikugol closed Grumant in 1962 and Pyramiden in 1998, while King Bay had to close mining at Ny-√Ölesund after the Kings Bay Affair. The 1990s and 2000s have seen major reductions of the Russian population and the creation of scientific establishments in Ny-√Ölesund and Longyearbyen. Tourism has also increased and become a major component of the economy of Longyearbyen. During the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s) =First verified discovery of Svalbard as a terra nullius= Spitsbergen and Svalbard during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s‚Äì1720s). Portion of 1599 map of Arctic exploration by Willem Barentsz. Spitsbergen, here mapped for the first time, is indicated as \\"Het Nieuwe Land\\" (Dutch for \\"the New Land\\"), center-left. In the Age of Discovery (Age of Exploration), the Dutch were the first (non-natives) to undisputedly explore and map many unknown isolated areas of the world, such as the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Map of Svalbard dating from 1758 There is no conclusive evidence of the first human activity on Svalbard. Swedish archeologist Hans Christiansson found flint and slate objects he identified as Stone Age tools dating from ca. 3000 BC, but there is little support among his peers as no dwelling place has been found.Arlov (1994): 12 During the 19th century, Norwegian historians proposed that Norse seamen had found Svalbard in 1194. This is based on annals that found Svalbar√∞i four days sailing from Iceland. Although it forms the basis for the modern name of the archipelago, there is no scientific consensus that supports the hypothesis. Russian historians have proposed that Russian Pomors may have visited the island as early as the 15th century.Arlov (1994): 13 This line was largely pursued by Soviet scholars, but again, no conclusive evidence has been found.Arlov (1994): 14 The Portuguese may also lay claim to have discovered or known about Svalbard first due to the close resemblance of the archipelago in the Cantino Planisphere, an early map famous for documenting Portuguese discoveries in the New World. If proven this would predate the official discovery by 94 years. The first undisputed discovery of the archipelago was an expedition led by the Dutch mariner Willem Barentsz, who was looking for the Northeast passage to China.Arlov (1994): 9 He first spotted Bj√∏rn√∏ya on 10 June 1596Arlov (1994): 10 and the northwestern tip of Spitsbergen on 17 June. The sighting of the archipelago was included in the accounts and maps made by the expedition and Spitsbergen was quickly included by cartographers.Arlov (1994): 11 Henry Hudson explored the islands in 1607. =International whaling base= Abraham Storck's 1690 depiction of Dutch whalers The first hunting expedition, to Bj√∏rn√∏ya, was organized by the Muscovy Company led by Steven Bennet in 1604. Although they found thousands of walrus, they were only able to kill a few because of their lack of experience. The following year he was more successful and returned annually until they in a few years had achieved local extinction. After Jonas Poole reported seeing a \\"great store of whales\\" off Spitsbergen in 1610, the Muscovy Company sent a whaling expedition to the island under command of Poole and Thomas Edge in 1611. They hired Basque experts to hunt the bowhead whale, but both ships were wrecked and the crews rescued by English interlope. The following year, the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition, but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers. The company claimed exclusive rights to the area and sent away the contenders. In 1613, seven armed English ships were sent on the expedition which expelled a few dozen Dutch, Spanish and French vessels.Arlov (1994): 16 This led to an international political conflict. The Dutch rejected the English exclusive rights, claiming the mare liberum principle. Christian IV claimed that Denmark‚ÄìNorway had the rights to all of Northern Sea in view of Greenland being an old Norwegian tax-land. England offered to purchase the rights from Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1614, but the offer was turned down, after which the English reverted to their exclusive rights claim. In 1615, Denmark‚ÄìNorway sent three man-o-wars to collect taxes from English and Dutch whalers, but all refused to pay.Arlov (1994): 18 The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark‚ÄìNorway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming it a free zone under mare liberum.Arlov (1994): 19 Walrus colony on Nordaustlandet In 1614, the English and Dutch partitioned the island, as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups. That year, the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a whaling cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand and was able to dominate the whaling and fend off the English. They established themselves in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized and there were only a limited number of aggressive incidents.Arlov (1994): 20 Initially, all nations hired Basque whalers,Arlov (1994): 23 although they gradually disappeared after their knowledge was learned by their companions. The whaling method was based on landing the whale, where it would be partitioned and the blubber boiled. With a high concentration of whales close to land, the method was efficient, as the companies would split the crew between the land station and hunting.Arlov (1994): 24 The most famous land station was the Dutch Smeerenburg on Amsterdam Island which had up to 200 people employed. Because of the high costs involved, only larger companies conducted whaling. By the late 17th century there were between 200 and 300 ships and in excess of 10,000 whalers around Spitsbergen.Arlov (1994): 25 The first overwintering was accidentally experienced by an English group in Bellsund in 1630‚Äì31. The first planned overwintering was achieved by the Noordsche Compagnie in 1633‚Äì34.Arlov (1994):35 Cornelis de Man's 1639 painting of whaling at Smeerenburg A limited amount of open-sea whaling was performed by interlopers‚Äîindependent entrepreneurs. The Noordsche Compagnie was disbanded by the government in 1642. The decade also saw an increase in whaling outside the main bays and fjords.Arlov (1994): 27 This gradually resulted in the abandoning of land stations as technological innovation allowed flensing along the ship, which allowed for pelagic whaling. Cooking of the oil was moved to the mainland.Arlov (1994): 31 While more cost-efficient, it resulted in a large portion of the meat being wasted. During the 18th century, Dutch whaling was reduced, until it ceased after 1770. The British gradually took the lead in Arctic whaling, but by around the start of the 19th century bowhead whales were scarce around Spitsbergen and the whalers moved elsewhere.Arlov (1994): 32 Hunting It is not known when Pomors first came to Svalbard, although permanent activity had been established by the mid-16th century.Arlov (1994): 36 Hunters were sent by merchants, and monasteries, such as Solovetsky Monastery, and settled in smaller stations along the coast. They would hunt reindeer, Arctic fox, seals, walrus and polar bears. The activity was most extensive at the end of the 18th century, when an estimated 100 to 150 overwintered.Arlov (1994): 37 Unlike the whaling, Pomor activity was sustainable, they alternated stations between seasons and did not deplete the natural resources.Arlov (1994): 38 Andr√©e's base on Danes Island Seal hunting in the waters between Svalbard and Greenland was started by Germans in the late 17th century. The activity was later taken over by Norwegians and Danish in the 18th century. Sealing was less profitable but could be carried with much less capital.Arlov (1994): 34 Norwegians came in contact with the Russians through the Pomor trade. Despite earlier attempts, not until 1794 did a Norwegian party reach Bj√∏rn√∏ya and the following years Spitsbergen. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast S√°mi from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795.Carlheim-Gyllensk√∂ld (1900), p. 155 From the 1820s the Norwegian hunting expeditions were taken up and continued through the rest of the century. Troms√∏ gradually replaced Hammerfest as the main port of origin. In the last third of the century, an average 27 Norwegian ships sailed to Svalbard.Arlov (1994): 39 In the winter of 1872‚Äì73, seventeen seal hunters died in the Svenskehuset Tragedy. Further exploration Exploration of the archipelago started in the 1610s as the whaling companies would send out small ships to find new areas to exploit. By 1650 it was established that Spitsbergen was an island and not connected to Greenland. Whalers gradually accumulated a good geographic knowledge of the coastline, but the interior remained uncharted.Arlov (1994): 42 The first scientific expedition to Svalbard was the Russian ƒåiƒçagov Expedition between 1764 and 1766, which passed Svalbard in an unsuccessful attempt to find the Northern Sea Route. It made among water and topography measurements.Arlov (1994): 43 The second expedition was organized by the Royal Navy and led by Constantine Phipps in 1773. His two ships, the Racehorse and the Carcass got stuck in the ice around Sju√∏yane before returning. They collected zoological and botanical samples and measured water temperatures, among others.Arlov (1994): 44 Norge in Ny-√Ölesund in 1926 Scientific exploration increased through the 18th century, with the most extensive surveys being carried out by William Scoresby, who published several papers on the Arctic, and Baltazar Mathias Keilhau. The latter was the first to carry out expeditions in the interior, abandoning the large-scale operations used by the British and Russians. With the exception of the British, smaller more targeted expeditions became the norm. Science also took foot as the dominant motivation for expeditions until the end of the 19th century.Arlov (1994): 45 A notable exception was the French Recherche expedition of 1838‚Äì39, which resulted in numerous publications in multiple fields and the construction of an observatory. Swedish exploration started with Sven Lov√©n in 1837, with lead way to Sweden dominating scientific investigations in the last half of the century. Particularly Otto Torell and Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld dedicated much of their research to the archipelago.Arlov (1994): 46 Martin Conway was the first to produce a map of the interior of Spitsbergen. Svalbard was used as the starting point for several expeditions to reach the North Pole by air. S. A. Andr√©e's Arctic Balloon Expedition failed in 1897.Arlov (1994): 48 Ny-√Ölesund was the basis for four attempts between 1925 and 1928, including Roald Amundsen's first attempt with a flying boat; Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd claimed they succeeded in 1926, but this has since been rejected.Hisdal (1998): 103 Amundsen's airship Norge is now credited as the first to the pole. Umberto Nobile's airship Italia crashed in 1928, resulting in the largest search in polar history. Industrialization Longyear City (today Longyearbyen) in 1908, two years after it was founded The first attempt at creating a permanent settlement was carried out by Sweden's Alfred Gabriel Nathorst. He established Kapp Thordsen on Isfjorden in 1872, but the planned phosphorite mining was not carried out and the settlement abandoned.Arlov (1994): 51 Coal had always been mined and gathered by whalers and hunters, but industrial mining did not start until 1899. S√∏ren Zachariassen of Troms√∏ was the first to establish a mining company to exploit Svalbard minerals. He claimed several places in Isfjorden and exported coal to the mainland, but lack of capital stopped further growth.Arlov (1994): 52 The first commercially viable mining company was John Munroe Longyear's Arctic Coal Company, which established Longyear City (from 1925 Longyearbyen). By 1910, 200 men were working for the company. The town and mines were bought by the Norwegian-owned Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani in 1916.Arlov (1994): 57 Another early entrepreneur was Ernest Mansfield and his Northern Exploration Company. He started marble mining on Blomstrandhalv√∏ya, but the marble was unusable and his company never had any profitable ventures, despite surveying large parts of the island. By the 1910s, it was established that coal was the only economically viable mining activity on Svalbard. Swedish interests established mines at Pyramiden and Sveagruva,Arlov (1994): 56 while Dutch investors established Barentsburg in 1920.Arlov (1994): 69 During the First World War, Norway saw the advantage of increasing self-supply of coal and Kings Bay established mining in Ny-√Ölesund in 1916. Jurisdiction Although Denmark‚ÄìNorway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius‚Äîa land without a government. The work to establish an administration was initiated by Nordenski√∂ld in 1871, in which he established that only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island.Arlov (1994): 60 Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard.Arlov (1994): 62 Yet the need for jurisdiction came from the mining community. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.Arlov (1994): 63 Remains of mining on Blomstrandhalv√∏ya The Government of Norway took initiative in 1907 for negotiations between the involved states. Multilateral conferences were held in 1910, 1912 and 1914, all of which proposed various types of joint rule.Arlov (1994): 64 The break-through came at the Paris Peace Conference. Germany and Russia had both been excluded, while Norway enjoyed much goodwill after their neutral ally policy during the war and was at the same time seen as harmless. The Svalbard Treaty of 9 February 1920 granted Norway full sovereignty over Svalbard, although with two major limitations: all parties to the treaty had equal rights to economic resources and the archipelago was not to be used for \\"warlike purposes\\".Arlov (1994): 65 After significant political debate, a proposal to establish Svalbard as a dependency and administrate it from Troms√∏ was rejected. Instead the Svalbard Act specified that the islands would be administrated by the Governor of Svalbard and was considered \\"part of the Kingdom of Norway\\", although not regarded as a county. The islands had until then been known as the Spitsbergen Archipelago, and it was at this time the term Svalbard was introduced. The legislation took effect on 14 August 1925.Arlov (1994): 68 A mining code was passed in 1925 and by 1927 all mining claims, some of which conflicted, were resolved.Arlov (1994): 70 All unclaimed land was taken over by the Norwegian Government. Although the Soviet Union was initially skeptical to the treaty, they were willing to trade a signing of it in exchange for a Norwegian recognition of the Soviet regime.Arlov (1994): 71 During the 1920s, mining fell into an economic slump, with several of the mining communities being closed. By the 1930s, only Store Norske and the Soviet state-owned Arktikugol were left. This led to more large-scale production, but left the archipelago with only two geopolitical interests, which led to a bilateralization of politics. Because both the Governor and the Commissioner of Mining only had a single person, which was stationed on the mainland during the winter, there was little Norwegian control over the Soviet communities.Arlov (1994): 72 Pre-war coal production peaked at in 1936, 57 percent of which was from Norwegian mines, and at which time the archipelago had a population of 1,900. The 1930s also saw a limited cod fishery from Ny-√Ölesund and a limited tourism with a scheduled ship service to the mainland.Arlov (1994): 73 World War II Hopen Radio on Hopen (pictured in 1999) was established by Germany during the war Svalbard was initially unaffected by the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940. However, following the German attack on the Soviet Union, Svalbard became of strategic importance to secure supplies between the Allies. At first, the Soviet Union proposed Soviet‚ÄìBritish occupation of the archipelago, but this was rejected by the Norwegian government-in-exile. Instead, an evacuation of all Norwegian and Soviet settlements were carried out by Operation Gauntlet in August and September.Arlov (1994): 74 With the island evacuated, German troops occupied Longyearbyen, where they built an airstrip and a weather station. In May 1942, a Norwegian expedition was sent to liberate the island; they were attacked by German aircraft, but were able to set up a garrison in Barentsburg. The German outpost was subsequently abandoned. The Germans, presumably underestimating the Allied forces' size, initiated Operation Zitronella. Along with nine destroyers, the battleships Tirpitz, the Scharnhorst were sent to Isfjorden where they leveled Barentsburg, Grumant and Longyearbyen. Sveagruva was bombed in an air raid in 1944.Arlov (1994): 75 The Germans established a weather station on Hopen, which was taken over by Norway after the war.Holm (1999): 53 Cold War The community center in Pyramiden, complete with a statue of Vladimir Lenin In 1944, the Soviet Union proposed that Svalbard become a condominium under joint Norwegian and Soviet rule, except for Bj√∏rn√∏ya, which would be transferred to the Soviet Union.Arlov (1994): 76 Although the proposal was discussed in Norway, it was ultimately rejected in 1947.Arlov (1994): 78 Reconstruction of the Norwegian settlements started in 1945 and they were quickly operational, and reaching pre-war production levels within a few years. Soviet reconstruction started in 1946, but Arktikugol was slower at gaining momentum in production. The Norwegian population stabilized at about 1,000 people, while there were about twice as many Soviets. The two nations built infrastructure, such as a postal service, radio stations and transport, independent of each other.Arlov (1994): 79 The political tension between Norway and the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949. The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard could not be under a NATO joint command, but this was rejected by Norway, and the issue laid at rest. A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed building a private airport at Ny-√Ölesund, which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian Government to avoid agitating the Soviet Union.Arlov (1994): 80 New protests were issued against the establishment of the European Space Research Organization's Kongsfjord Telemetry Station, although the protests did not stop construction. A compromise about a Norwegian civilian airport was reached in 1971Arlov (1994): 81 and Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened in 1975, serving both Soviet and Norwegian towns.Arlov (1994): 82 MS Nordsyssel at dock in Ny-√Ölesund Grumant was closed in 1961.Arlov (1994): 83 The following year, 21 miners were killed in an accident in Ny-√Ölesund, which led to the Kings Bay Affair, ultimately resulting in the withdrawal of Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. They were granted claims based on indications, rather than samples, of oil, which was not granted to Arktikugol, leading to strained relations with the Soviet Union. No commercially viable wells were found. A new round of searching in the 1980s was also fruitless.Arlov (1994): 84 Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, and in particular the lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements. After mining was closed in Ny-√Ölesund, the Norwegian Polar Institute took a dominant role in converting it to an international research station.Arlov (1994): 85 In 1973, more than half the archipelago was protected through four national parks, fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves. Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976.Holm (1999): 119 From 1973, they started mining at Svea, but operations ceased in 1987.Holm (1999): 141 Normalization The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association's incoherent scatter radar in Adventdalen outside Longyearbyen \\"Normalization\\" was a term coined in the 1970s to transform Longyearbyen from a company town to a regular community.Arlov (1994): 86 The first steps towards local democracy were taken with the 1971 establishment of the Svalbard Council for the Norwegian population, although it only had a commentary function.Hisdal (1998): 116 Public services were transferred to the company Svalbard Samfunnsdrift in 1989,Holm (1999): 137 while private enterprise established services such as construction companies and a mall.Holm (1999): 125 Tourism became a livelihood with the establishment of hotels from 1995.Holm (1999): 132 From 2002 Longyearbyen Community Council was incorporated with many of the same responsibilities as a municipality. Since the 1990s, several research and hi-tech institutes have established themselves, such as the University Centre in Svalbard, the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association,Holm (1999): 36 the Svalbard Satellite Station, the Svalbard Undersea Cable System and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The 1990s saw a large reduction in Russian activity. Schools were closed in 1994 and children and mothers were sent to the mainland, reducing the population of Barentsburg to 800 and of Pyramiden to 600.Hisdal (1998): 115 Operations resumed at Svea in 1997, while Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998. The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act came into effect in 2002 and was followed up with three new national parks and three new nature reserves. From 1990 to 2011, the Russian and Ukrainian population fell from 2,300 to 370, while the Norwegian population increased from 1,100 to 2,000.

Constructed of wood, similar to fishing dories built in Atlantic Canada and New England, the iceboats were operated in the Northumberland Strait during the 19th century and early 20th century, running between Prince Edward Island and the mainland provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during the winter months between December and April when sea ice made passage by non-icebreaking steam ships impossible. They were also used during the winter months to connect Pictou Island with mainland Nova Scotia, sometimes in conjunction with passages from Prince Edward Island. outdoor interpretive iceboat display at Cape Traverse Throughout the 19th century, iceboats became an essential link to mainland North America for Prince Edward Island, transporting both mail and passengers. Passengers would pay a premium fee to sit in the boat for the entire crossing, or a reduced rate if they assisted the crew. In addition to pulling ropes attached to the iceboat, hand-holds were molded along the outer gunwales which were used for hauling the iceboat over sea ice until reaching stretches of open water. The greatest danger that iceboat crews and passengers faced was not the stretches of open water, nor the sea ice, but rather the heavy \\"slush\\" that would pool in areas of open water that were in the process of solidifying into ice. There are several accounts of boats becoming mired in these conditions and oars being broken during attempts to row through the slush. Wind and tide formed another danger as the fields of sea ice were prone to rapid drifting as a result of these forces. There have been accounts of iceboats being swept up or down the Northumberland Strait and landing far from their intended destinations. Strandings also occurred in which case iceboat occupants would huddle on the surface of an ice floe beneath the upended iceboat waiting for storms to pass, sometimes breaking parts of the boat off for fire wood to stave off the cold. Not many lives were lost during these perilous crossings. The two primary routes for iceboats was between Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island and Caribou, Nova Scotia, (sometimes combined with a stop at Pictou Island, Nova Scotia), and across the Abegweit Passage between Cape Traverse, Prince Edward Island and Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick. This latter route, was known as the \\"Capes Route\\" and was the longest running iceboat service, operating from December 19, 1827 until 1917 when the icebreaking railcar ferry Prince Edward Island began service on this route. Original Northumberland Strait iceboats are preserved at the Northumberland Fisheries Museum in Pictou, Nova Scotia as well as the Gateway Village tourism complex in Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island; an outdoor interpretive display can be seen in Cape Traverse.

After receiving a classical education at the Portsmouth Abbey School, Buckley graduated from Yale University in 1975.\\"Yale Class Day Speaker: Christopher Buckley\\" , Yale University, Office of Public Affairs and Communications, May 24, 2009 He was a member of Skull and Bones like his father, living at Jonathan Edwards College. In 1981, he moved to Washington, D.C. to work as chief speechwriter for Vice President George H. W. Bush. This experience led to his novel The White House Mess, a satire on White House office politics and political memoirs.The book's title refers to the White House lunchroom, which is known as the \\"mess\\" because the Navy operates it. Buckley wrote the non-fiction Steaming to Bamboola about the merchant marine. He also contributed to an oral history of Milford, Connecticut, served as managing editor of Esquire, and worked as an editor at Forbes magazine. =National Review= For a brief time in summer and fall 2008, Christopher Buckley wrote the back-page column for National Review, the conservative magazine founded by his father. He ceased to write this column after endorsing the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama, in October 2008. Buckley's endorsement (entitled \\"Sorry Dad, I'm Voting for Obama\\") appeared in The Daily Beast. After many National Review readers and contributors expressed their displeasure, Buckley resigned from National Review. Buckley disavowed the title of his article endorsing Obama (which many of his father's friends and supporters found offensive, particularly as it appeared shortly after his father's death), but continued to occasionally write for The Daily Beast. =Family= Buckley first married Lucy Gregg. Gregg is the daughter of Donald Gregg, who served as assistant to Vice President Bush for national security affairs. Buckley and Gregg have two children, Caitlin and William (born in 1988 and 1991, respectively). In 2000, Buckley's son, Jonathan, was born to former Random House publicist Irina Woelfle. Buckley and Gregg divorced in 2011. In 2012, Buckley married Dr. Katherine \\"Katy\\" Close, a physician. She has four children.

His father was Roger de Montgomery, seigneur of Montgomery, and was a relative, probably a grandnephew, of the Duchess Gunnor, wife of Duke Richard I of Normandy. The elder Roger had large holdings in central Normandy, chiefly in the valley of the Dives, which the younger Roger inherited. Life Roger was one of William the Conqueror's principal counsellors, playing a major role in the Council of Lillebonne. He may not have fought in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. According to Wace's Roman de Rou, however, he commanded the Norman right flank at Hastings, returning to Normandy with King William in 1067. Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defence of England, receiving the Rape of Arundel at the end of 1067 (or in early 1068), and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury; a few historians believe that while he received the Shropshire territories in 1071 he was not created Earl until a few years later. In 1083, he founded Shrewsbury Abbey. Roger was thus one of the half dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror's reign. William gave Earl Roger nearly all of what is now the county of West Sussex, which at the time of the Domesday Survey was the Rape of Arundel.Salzmann.'The rape of Chichester: Introduction', A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4: The Rape of Chichester (1953), pp. 1-2. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41682 Date accessed: 8 August 2010 The Rape of Arundel was eventually split into two rapes, one continuing with the name Rape of Arundel and the other became the Rape of Chichester. Besides the 83 manors in Sussex, his possessions also included seven-eighths of Shropshire which was associated with the earldom of Shrewsbury, he had estates in Surrey (4 manors), Hampshire (9 manors), Wiltshire (3 manors), Middlesex (8 manors), Gloucestershire (1 manor), Worcestershire (2 manors), Cambridgeshire (8 manors), Warwickshire (11 manors), and Staffordshire (30 manors).Horsfield. History of Sussex. pp. 76‚Äì77 The income from Roger's estates would amount to about ¬£2,000 per year, in 1086 the landed wealth for England was around ¬£72,000, so it would have represented almost 3% of the nation's GDP.Domesday Pase After William I's death in 1087, Roger joined with other rebels to overthrow the newly crowned king, William II, in the Rebellion of 1088. However, William was able to convince Roger to abandon the rebellion and side with him. This worked out favourably for Roger, as the rebels were beaten and lost their land holdings in England. Family Roger married Mabel de Bell√™me, who was heiress to a large territory straddling the border between Normandy and Maine. The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis paints a picture of Mabel of Bell√™me being a scheming and cruel woman.Orderic Vitalis. The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis, Volume 2, Book 3. pp. 49‚Äì55 She was murdered by Hugh Bunel and his brothers who, possibly in December 1077, rode into her castle of Bures-sur-Dive and cut off her head as she lay in bed.Orderic Vitalis.

The term may also be used to refer to committing a particular individual or group to an institution, such as a mental or welfare institution. The term may also be used in a political sense to apply to the creation or organization of governmental institutions or particular bodies responsible for overseeing or implementing policy, for example in welfare or development. '' As a sociopolitical phenomenon'' During the period of the industrial revolution in Europe many countries went through a period of \\"institutionalization\\", which saw a large expansion and development of the role of government within society, particularly into areas seen previously as the private sphere. Institutionalization is also seen as being an important part of process of modernization in developing countries, involving again the expansion and improved organization of government structures. History During the period from 1850 to 1930 many types of institutions were created by public subscription, Parliament and local authorities to provide housing, healthcare, education, and financial support for individuals in need. At the upper end of the scale, public boarding schools such as Eton and Harrow were founded or greatly extended to meet the growing demand for the education of the children of those in colonial service overseas. These were seen as models of social improvement, and many inferior imitations followed for the lower social orders. Virtually every borough in the UK was required by legislation to make provision for paupers, homeless, released prisoners, convicted criminals, orphans, disabled war veterans, older people with no means of support, deaf and blind schools, schools and colonies for those with learning disabilities or mental health problems. Distinguishing features of such institutions were frequently, but not exclusively: Ervin Goffman, Characteristics of Total Institutions * communal dormitories * communal kitchens and dining facilities * rural, isolated locations * restrictions on personal liberty and possessions * uniforms * oppressive, authoritarian regimes * strict systems of rules and codes of conduct * boards of visitors or trustees, usually drawn from the ranks of the upper middle classes, the so- called \\"great and good\\" * hierarchical systems of management * compulsory religious attendance * involvement of inmates as unpaid or poorly rewarded labour in return for small privileges * widespread abuse of human rights, dignity * rigid separation of the sexes * excessive reliance on medication and physical restraints Many of these organisations, whilst originally expressing idealistic aspirations and aims, became \\"total\\" institutions within a generation or two of their foundation, providing in some cases cradle to grave housing, occupation and social control. Founding charters usually proclaimed beneficial outcomes of \\"reform\\" (or rehabilitation) of character through moral and occupation education and discipline, but in practice inmates were often trapped in a system that provided no obvious route of escape or promotion. As late as the 1950s, in Britain, several hundred thousand people lived in Victorian asylums and \\"colonies\\". Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in his opus The Social Contract that \\"Slaves lose everything in their chains, even the desire of escaping from them: they love their servitude\\". Institutionalization is a similar process.

The inventor of the first such bomb was the British engineer Barnes Wallis, whose \\"Upkeep\\" bouncing bomb was used in the RAF's Operation Chastise of May 1943 to bounce into German dams and explode underwater, with effect similar to the underground detonation of the Grand Slam and Tallboy earthquake bombs, both of which he also invented. British bouncing bombs Herne Bay Museum Barnes Wallis' April 1942 paper \\"Spherical Bomb ‚Äì Surface Torpedo\\" described a method of attack in which a weapon would be bounced across water until it struck its target, then sink to explode underwater, much like a depth charge. Bouncing it across the surface would allow it to be aimed directly at its target, while avoiding underwater defences, as well as some above the surface, and such a weapon would take advantage of the \\"bubble pulse\\" effect typical of underwater explosions, greatly increasing its effectiveness: Wallis's paper identified suitable targets as hydro-electric dams \\"and floating vessels moored in calm waters such as the Norwegian fjords\\".Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), pp. 107, 113. Both types of target were already of great interest to the British military when Wallis wrote his paper (which itself was not his first on the subject); German hydro-electric dams had been identified as important bombing targets before the outbreak of World War II, but existing bombs and bombing methods had little effect on them, as torpedo nets protected them from attack by conventional torpedoes and a practical means of destroying them had yet to be devised. In 1942, the British were seeking a means of destroying the German battleship , which posed a threat to Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and had already survived a number of British attempts to destroy it. During this time, the Tirpitz was being kept safe from attack by being moored in Norwegian fjords, where it had the effect of a \\"fleet in being\\".Flower (2002), pp. 10‚Äì19, Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), pp. 105‚Äì07, and \\"Barnes Wallis's other bouncing bomb Part 2: Target Tirpitz \\", in RAF Air Power Review, 5 (3), Autumn 2002 (pp. 47‚Äì57), p. 51. See also Tirpitz Battleship ‚Äì \\"Operational history\\". Consequently, Wallis's proposed weapon attracted attention and underwent active testing and development. On 24 July 1942, a \\"spectacularly successful\\" demonstration of such a weapon's potential occurred when a redundant dam at Nant-y-Gro, near Rhayader, in Wales, was destroyed by a mine containing of explosive: this was detonated against the dam's side, underwater, in a test undertaken by A.R. Collins, a scientific officer from the Road Research Laboratory, which was then based at Harmondsworth, Middlesex.Flower (2002), p. 20. See also Solutions and Nant-y-Gro Dam , and video Nant-y-Gro Test (broadband) or Nant-y-Gro Test (dialup) . The Dambusters (617 Squadron) . Retrieved 12 August 2010. A.R. Collins was among a large number of other people besides Barnes Wallis who made wide-ranging contributions to the development of a bouncing bomb and its method of delivery to a target, to the extent that, in a paper published in 1982, Collins himself made it evident that Wallis \\"did not play an all-important role in the development of this project and in particular, that very significant contributions were made by, for example, Sir William Glanville, Dr. G. Charlesworth, Dr. A.R. Collins and others of the Road Research Laboratory\\".Quotation from Johnson (1998), pp. 29‚Äì31, citing Collins, A.R., \\"The origins and design of the attack on the German dams\\", in Proceedings ‚Äì Institution of Civil Engineers. Part 2. Research and theory, 73, 1982. However, the modification of a Vickers Wellington bomber, the design of which Wallis himself had contributed to, for work in early testing of his proposed weapon, has been cited as an example of how Wallis \\"would have been the first to acknowledge\\" the contributions of others.Flower (2002), p. 19. Also, in the words of Eric Allwright, who worked in the Drawing Office for Vickers Armstrongs at the time, \\"Wallis was trying to do his ordinary job [for Vickers Armstrongs] as well as all this ‚Äì he was out at the Ministry and down to Fort Halstead and everywhere\\"; Wallis's pressing of his papers, ideas and ongoing developments on relevant authorities helped ensure that development continued; Wallis was principal designer of the models, prototypes and \\"live\\" versions of the weapon; and, perhaps most significantly, it was Wallis who explained the weapon in the final briefing for RAF crews before they set off on Operation Chastise, to use one of his designs in action.Flower (2002), e.g. pp. 30, 42, and Sweetman (2002), (Parts 1 & 2). A distinctive feature of the weapon, added in the course of development, was back-spin, which improved the height and stability of its flight and its ability to bounce, and helped the weapon to remain in contact with, or at least close proximity to, its target on arrival. Back-spin is a normal feature in the flight of golf balls, owing to the manner in which they are struck by the club, and it is perhaps for this reason that all forms of the weapon which were developed were known generically as \\"Golf mines\\", and some of the spherical prototypes featured dimples. It was decided in November 1942 to devise a larger version of Wallis's weapon for use against dams, and a smaller one for use against ships: these were code-named \\"Upkeep\\" and \\"Highball\\" respectively.Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), p. 110. A third version, code-named \\"Baseball\\", was also planned for use by MTBs or MGBs of the Royal Navy Coastal Forces, but \\"never saw the light of day\\": Flower (2002), p. 22. Though each version derived from what was originally envisaged as a spherical bomb, early prototypes for both Upkeep and Highball consisted of a cylindrical bomb within a spherical casing. Development, testing and use of Upkeep and Highball were to be undertaken simultaneously, since it was important to retain the element of surprise: if one were to be used against a target independently, it was feared that German defences for similar targets would be strengthened, rendering the other useless.Flower (2002), p. 22; Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), p. 114. However, Upkeep was developed against a deadline, since its maximum effectiveness depended on target dams being as full as possible from seasonal rainfall, and the latest date for this was set at 26 May 1943.Flower (2002), p. 25. In the event, as this date approached, Highball remained in development, whereas development of Upkeep had completed, and the decision was taken to deploy Upkeep independently.Sweetman (2002), (Part 2), p. 48. In January 1974, under Britain's \\"thirty year rule\\", secret government files for both Upkeep and Highball were released, although technical details of the weapons had been released in 1963. =Upkeep= Animation of the principle of the bouncing bomb. The bomb is dropped close to the surface of the lake. Because it is moving almost horizontally, at high velocity and with backspin, it bounces several times instead of sinking. Each bounce is smaller than the previous one. The \\"bomb run\\" is calculated so that at its final bounce, the bomb will reach close to the target, where it sinks. A hydrostatic pistol causes it to explode at the right depth, creating destructive shockwaves. M√∂hne dam breached by Upkeep bombs Testing of Upkeep prototypes with inert filling was carried out at Chesil Beach, Dorset, flying from RAF Warmwell in December 1942, and at Reculver, Kent, flying from RAF Manston in April and May 1943, at first using a Vickers Wellington bomber.Flower (2002), p. 21. However, the dimensions and weight of the full-size Upkeep were such that it could only be carried by the largest British bomber available at the time, the Avro Lancaster, and even that had to undergo considerable modification in order to carry it.Flower (2002), p. 27. See also Avro Lancaster \\"B III (Special)\\". In testing, it was found that Upkeep's spherical casing would shatter on impact with water, but that the inner cylinder containing the bomb would continue across the surface of the water much as intended.Flower (2002), pp. 29‚Äì30.

Note that this film is at half speed; consequently back-spin is easily seen. As a result, Upkeep's spherical casing was eliminated from the design. Development and testing concluded on 13 May 1943 with the dropping of a live, cylindrical Upkeep bomb out to sea from Broadstairs, Kent, by which time Wallis had specified that the bomb must be dropped at \\"precisely\\" above the water and groundspeed, with back-spin at 500 rpm: the bomb \\"bounced seven times over some 800 yards, sank and detonated\\".Flower (2002), pp. 30‚Äì31.

In the operational version of Upkeep, known by its manufacturer as \\"Vickers Type 464\\", the explosive charge was Torpex, originally designed for use as a torpedo explosive, to provide a longer explosive pulse for greater effect against underwater targets; the principal means of detonation was by three hydrostatic pistols, as used in depth charges, set to fire at a depth of ; and its overall weight was , of which was Torpex. Provision was also made for \\"self-destruct\\" detonation by a fuze, armed automatically as the bomb was dropped from the aircraft, and timed to fire after 90 seconds.Flower (2002), p. 31.

The bomb was held in place in the aircraft by a pair of calipers, or triangulated carrying arms, which swung away from either end of the bomb to release it.Flower (2002), p. 31. Diagrams from document produced by Dr Wallis to explain how the bouncing bomb Upkeep worked. The National Archives. Retrieved 10 August 2010. Back-spin was to begin 10 minutes before arriving at a target, and was imparted via a belt driven by a Vickers Jassey hydraulic motor mounted forward of the bomb's starboard side. This motor was powered by the hydraulic system normally used by the upper gun turret, which had been removed.. Backspin was required so that the bomb, having bounced back off the dam would move back towards the surface as it sank due to the Magnus Effect. Close contact with the dam was necessary to obtain the maximum effectiveness from the explosive. Height was checked by a pair of intersecting spotlight beams, which, when converging on the surface of the water, indicated the correct height for the aircraft ‚Äì a method devised for the raid by Benjamin Lockspeiser of MAP, and distance from the target by a simple, hand-held, triangular device: with one corner held up to the eye, projections on the other two corners would line up with pre- determined points on the target when it was at the correct distance for bomb release. In practice, this could prove awkward to handle, and some aircrews replaced it with their own arrangements, fixed within the aircraft itself, and involving chinagraph and string.Flower (2002), pp. 35‚Äì36. On the night of 16/17 May 1943, Operation Chastise attacked dams in Germany's Ruhr Valley, using Upkeep. Two dams were breached, causing widespread flooding and damage, and loss of life. The significance of this attack upon the progress of the war is debated.See Operation Chastise ‚Äì Effect on the war. British losses during the operation were heavy; eight of the 19 attacking aircraft failed to return, along with 53 of 113 RAF aircrew.Johnson (1998), p. 31, describes this as \\"about average losses in bombing raids at that time\\", but cf. Problems, The Dambusters (617 Squadron) . Retrieved 10 August 2010. Upkeep was not used again operationally. By the time the war ended, the remaining operational Upkeep bombs had started to deteriorate and were dumped into the North Sea without their detonation devices.Flower (2002), p. 62, and Robert Owen, \\"Operation Guzzle\\", in Breaching the German Dams Flying into History, RAF Museum, 2008. =Highball= In April 1942, Wallis himself had described his proposed weapon as \\"essentially a weapon for the Fleet Air Arm\\". This naval aspect was later to be pressed by a minute issued by British prime minister Winston Churchill, in February 1943, asking \\"Have you given up all plans for doing anything to while she is in Trondheim? ... It is a terrible thing that this prize should be waiting and no one be able to think of a way of winning it.\\"Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 106. However, Highball was ultimately developed as an RAF weapon for use against various targets, including Tirpitz. From November 1942, development and testing for Highball continued alongside that of Upkeep, including the dropping of prototypes at both Chesil Beach and Reculver. While early prototypes dropped at Chesil Beach in December 1942 were forerunners for both versions of the bomb, those dropped at Chesil Beach in January and February 1943 and at Reculver in April 1943 included Highball prototypes.Sweetman (2002), Part 1, pp. 112, 118. They were dropped by the modified Wellington bomber and at Reculver by a modified de Havilland Mosquito B Mk IV, one of two assigned to Vickers Armstrong for the purpose.Sweetman (2002), Part 1, pp. 114, 118. By early February 1943, Wallis envisaged Highball as \\"comprising a charge in a cylinder contained in a sphere with (an overall weight) of \\", and a modified Mosquito could carry two such weapons.Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 113. Highball bouncing bomb prototype, now on display at Abbotsbury Swannery In tests at Reculver in the middle of April 1943, it was found that Highball's spherical casing suffered similar damage to that of Upkeep. A prototype with an altered design of casing strengthened by steel plate, but empty of inert filling or explosive, was dropped on 30 April and emerged \\"quite undamaged\\".Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 118. In further testing on 2 May, two examples of this prototype with inert filling, bounced across the surface of the water as intended, though both were found to be dented.Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 119. Further testing was carried out by three modified Mosquitoes flying from RAF Turnberry, north of Girvan, on the west coast of Scotland, against a target ship, the former French battleship , which had been moored for the purpose in Loch Striven.Sweetman (2002), Part 2, p. 52. RAF Turnberry occupied the site of Turnberry golf resort. This series of tests, on 9 and 10 May, was hampered by a number of errors: buoys intended to mark a point from Courbet, where the prototypes were to be dropped, were found to be too close to the ship by , and, according to Wallis, other errors were due to \\"Variations in dimensions of [prototypes] after filling and [dimensionally incorrect] jigs for setting up the [caliper] arms\\".Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 52‚Äì53. Because of these errors, the prototypes hit the target too fast and too hard, and two aircraft failed to release their prototypes, one of which then fell off while the aircraft was turning for a second attempt. It was under such circumstances that Upkeep came to be deployed independently of Highball. In addition to continuing problems in testing Highball, it had been observed at the end of March 1943 that \\"At best [aircrews] would need two months' special training\\".Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 115. With this in mind, 618 Squadron had been formed on 1 April 1943 at RAF Skitten, near Wick, in northeastern Scotland, to undertake \\"Operation Servant\\", in which Tirpitz would be attacked with Highball bouncing bombs.Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 48‚Äì49. On 18 April it was recommended that Operation Servant should be undertaken before the end of June, since 618 Squadron could not be held back for this purpose indefinitely. It was not until early September 1943 that, in view of continuing problems with both Highball and its release mechanism, most of 618 Squadron was \\"released for other duties\\". This in practice meant the abandonment of Operation Servant.Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 54, 57. Core personnel of 618 Squadron were retained and these continued work on the development of Highball.Flower (2002), p. 78. Testing between 15 and 17 May 1944 showed progress with Highball. By this time Courbet had been designated for use as a Gooseberry breakwater for the invasion of Normandy, so the old battleship , then in reserve, was used instead (also moored in Loch Striven). With crew on board Malaya, bombers dropped inert Highball prototypes fitted with hydrostatic pistols, aiming at the ship. They struck the ship, and at least two punched a hole in the ship's side. On 17 May, for the first time, Highball prototypes were released in pairs, only one second apart.Flower (2002), pp. 78‚Äì79. By the end of May 1944, problems with releasing Highball had been resolved as had problems with aiming. Aiming Highball required a different method from Upkeep; the problem was solved by Wallis's design of a ring aperture sight fixed to a flying helmet.Flower (2002), pp. 78‚Äì80. Highball was now a sphere with flattened poles and the explosive charge was Torpex, enclosed in a cylinder, as in Upkeep; detonation was by a single hydrostatic pistol, set to fire at a depth of , and its weight was , of which was Torpex. Highball was never used operationally: on 12 November 1944, in Operation Catechism, Lancasters with Tallboy bombs sank its primary target, Tirpitz. Other potential targets had been considered during Highball's development and later. These included the ships of the Italian navy, canals, dry docks, submarine pens, and railway tunnels (for which testing took place in 1943). But Italy surrendered in September 1943, and the other target ideas were dismissed as impracticable.Flower (2002), e.g. pp. 66‚Äì67, 72‚Äì76. On 3 September 1943, an armistice was signed between Italy and the Allies. In January 1945, at the Vickers experimental facility at Foxwarren, near Cobham, Surrey, a Douglas A-26 Invader of the USAAF was adapted to carry two Highballs almost completely enclosed in the bomb bay, using parts from a Mosquito conversion. After brief flight testing in the UK, the kit was sent to Wright Field, Ohio and installed in an A-26C Invader. Twenty-five inert Highballs, renamed \\"Speedee\\" bombs, were also sent for use in the USAAF trials. Drop tests were carried out over Choctawhatchee Bay near Eglin Field, Florida but the programme was abandoned, after the bomb bounced back at A-26C-25-DT Invader 43-22644 on Water Range 60, causing loss of the rear fuselage and a fatal crash on 28 April 1945.Flower (2002), pp. 87‚Äì88.

German bouncing bomb A post-war diagram of a German Kurt, rocket-boosted bouncing bomb. After Operation Chastise, German forces discovered an Upkeep bomb intact in the wreckage of the Lancaster commanded by Flt Lt Barlow, which had struck high tension cables at Haldern, near Rees, Germany and crashed; the bomb had not been released and the aircraft had crashed on land, firing none of the detonation devices.Flower (2002), pp. 50, 61‚Äì62. Subsequently, a version of Upkeep, code-named \\"Kurt\\" or \\"Emil\\", was built at the Luftwaffe's Erprobungsstelle, or \\"test site\\", on Germany's Baltic coast at Travem√ºnde, one in a network of four such establishments in Nazi Germany. The importance of back-spin was not understood and trials by a Focke- Wulf Fw 190 proved to be dangerous to the aircraft as the bomb matched the speed at which it was dropped. Attempts to rectify this with booster rockets failed and the project was cancelled in 1944.Flower (2002), p. 62, Sweetman (1999). Soviet forces are reputed to have used two bouncing bombs during the attack that sank the World War II German anti-aircraft cruiser Niobe in Kotka, Finland on 16 July 1944; but no development details are known for this device and it may have been a skip bombing incident. Re-creating the bouncing bomb In 2011, a project was initiated to re-create a Dambusters raid. Buffalo Airways was selected as the company to fly the mission, with their own plane and pilots. Buffalo would drop a re-created 'Upkeep' bouncing bomb from their DC-4. The project was documented in the documentary television show Dambusters Fly Again in Canada and Australia, Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb in the UK, and the Nova episode Bombing Hitler's Dams in the US. It involved dropping a replica dummy bomb, which performed as intended striking a replica dam which had been specially constructed; this was subsequently destroyed by a charge placed where the bomb had landed.History Television, Dambusters Fly Again (accessed 2011 August)The Telegraph (London), \\"The day the Dam Busters returned... in Canada\\", Tom Chivers, 2 May 2011 (accessed 2011 August)EAA, \\"'Ice Pilots' Help Re-Create 'Dambusters'\\" , Hal Bryan, 5 May 2011 (accessed 2011 August)Channel 4, \\"Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb\\" (accessed 2011 August)PBS, WGBH, Nova, \\"Bombing Hitler's Dams\\".

Petrified wood typifies this process, but all organisms, from bacteria to vertebrates, can become petrified (although harder, more durable matter such as bone, beaks, and shells survive the process better than softer remains such as muscle tissue, feathers, or skin). Petrifaction takes place through a combination of two similar processes: permineralization and replacement. These processes create replicas of the original specimen that are similar down to the microscopic level.  Processes  = Permineralization = One of the processes involved in petrifaction is permineralization. The fossils created through this process tend to contain a large amount of the original material of the specimen. This process occurs when groundwater containing dissolved minerals (most commonly quartz, calcite, apatite (calcium phosphate), siderite (iron carbonate), and pyrite), fills pore spaces and cavities of specimens, particularly bone, shell or wood. The pores of the organisms' tissues are filled when these minerals precipitate out of the water. Two common types of permineralization are silicification and pyritization.  Silicification  Silicification is the process in which organic matter becomes saturated with silica. A common source of silica is volcanic material. Studies have shown that in this process, most of the original organic matter is destroyed. Silicification most often occurs in two environments-either the specimen is buried in sediments of deltas and floodplains or organisms are buried in volcanic ash. Water must be present for silicification to occur because it reduces the amount of oxygen present and therefore reduces the deterioration of the organism by fungi, maintains organism shape, and allows for the transportation and deposition of silica. The process begins when a specimen is permeated with an aqueous silica solution. The cell walls of the specimen are progressively dissolved and silica is deposited into the empty spaces. In wood samples, as the process proceeds, cellulose and lignin, two components of wood, are degraded and replaced with silica. The specimen is transformed to stone (a process called lithification) as water is lost. For silicification to occur, the geothermic conditions must include a neutral to slightly acidic pH and a temperature and pressure similar to shallow-depth sedimentary environments. Under ideal natural conditions, silicification can occur at rates approaching those seen in artificial petrification.  Pyritization  Pyritization is a process similar to silicification, but instead involves the deposition of iron and sulfur in the pores and cavities of an organism. Pyritization can result in both solid fossils as well as preserved soft tissues. In marine environments, pyritization occurs when organisms are buried in sediments containing a high concentration of iron sulfides. Organisms release sulfide, which reacts with dissolved iron in the surrounding water, when they decay. This reaction between iron and sulfides forms pyrite (FeS2). Carbonate shell material of the organism is then replaced with pyrite due to a higher concentration of pyrite and a lower concentration of carbonate in the surrounding water. Pyritization occurs to a lesser extent in plants in clay environments. = Replacement = Replacement, the second process involved in petrifaction, occurs when water containing dissolved minerals dissolves the original solid material of an organism, which is then replaced by minerals. This can take place extremely slowly, replicating the microscopic structure of the organism. The slower the rate of the process, the better defined the microscopic structure will be. The minerals commonly involved in replacement are calcite, silica, pyrite, and hematite. It is rare to find organisms preserved by replacement alone (as opposed to in combination with permineralization), but these fossils present significant importance to paleontologists because these fossils tend to be very detailed.  Uses  Not only are the fossils produced through the process of petrifaction used for paleontological study, but they have also been used as both decorative and informative pieces. Petrified wood is used in several ways. Slabs of petrified wood can be crafted into tabletops, or the slabs themselves are sometimes displayed in a decorative fashion. Also, larger pieces of the wood have been carved into sinks and basins. Other large pieces can also be crafted into chairs and stools. Petrified wood and other petrified organisms have also been used in jewelry, sculpture, clock-making, ashtrays and fruit bowls, and landscape and garden decorations. = Architecture = Petrified wood has also been used in construction. The Petrified Wood Gas Station, located on Main St Lamar, Colorado, was built in 1932 and consists of walls and floors constructed from pieces of petrified wood. The structure, built by W.G. Brown, has since been converted to office space and a used car dealership. Glen Rose, Texas provides even more examples of the use of fossilized wood in architecture. Beginning in the 1920s, the farmers of Somervell County, Texas began uncovering petrified trees. Local craftsmen and masons then built over 65 structures from this petrified wood, 45 of which were still standing as of June 2009. These structures include gas stations, flowerbeds, cottages, restaurants, fountains and gateposts. Glen Rose, Texas is also noted for Dinosaur Valley State Park and the Glen Rose Formation, where fossilized dinosaur footprints from the Cretaceous period can be viewed. Another example of the use of petrified wood in construction is the Agate House Pueblo in the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Built by ancestral Pueblo people about 990 years ago, this eight-room building was constructed almost entirely out of petrified wood and is believed to have served as either a family home or ceremonial center.  Artificial petrifaction  In 2005 scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) reported that they had successfully petrified wood samples artificially. Unlike natural petrification, though, they infiltrated samples in acidic solutions, diffused them internally with titanium and carbon and fired them in a high-temperature oven (circa 1400 ¬∞C) in an inert atmosphere to yield a man-made ceramic matrix composite of titanium carbide and silicon carbide still showing the initial structure of wood. Future uses would see these artificially petrified wood-ceramic materials eventually replace metal- based superalloys (which are coated with ultrahard ceramics) in the tool industry. Other vegetal matter could be treated in a similar process and yield abrasive powders. Scientists attempted to artificially petrify organisms as early as the 18th century, when Girolamo Segato claimed to have supposedly \\"petrified\\" human remains. His methods were lost, but the bulk of his \\"pieces\\" are on display at the Museum of the Department of Anatomy in Florence, Italy. More recent attempts have been both successful and documented, but should be considered as semi-petrifaction or incomplete petrifaction or at least as producing some novel type of wood composite, as the wood material remains to a certain degree; the constituents of wood (cellulose, lignins, lignans, oleoresins, etc.) have not been replaced by silicate, but have been infiltrated by specially formulated acidic solutions of aluminosilicate salts that gel in contact with wood matter and form a matrix of silicates within the wood after being left to react slowly for a given period of time in the solution or heat-cured for faster results. Hamilton Hicks of Greenwich, Connecticut, received a patent for his \\"recipe\\" for rapid artificial petrifaction of wood under US patent 4,612,050 in 1986. Hicks' recipe consists of highly mineralized water and a sodium silicate solution combined with a dilute acid with a pH of 4.0-5.5. Samples of wood are penetrated with this mineral solution through repeated submersion and applications of the solution. Wood treated in this fashion is - according to the claims in the patent - incapable of being burned and acquires the features of petrified wood. Some uses of this product as suggested by Hicks include use by horse breeders who desire fireproof stables constructed of nontoxic material that would also be resistant to chewing of the wood by horses.

In the 1960s, he presented a rock and roll radio show modeled after Dick Clark's American Bandstand called Salut les copains which launched the musical genre of y√©-y√©. The show's success led to his creation of a magazine of the same name, eventually renamed Salut!, which built a circulation of one million copies. Filipacchi played American and French rock music on this radio show beginning in the early 1960s. The show and Filipacchi himself played an important role in the formation of a 1960s youth culture in France. Filipacchi acquired the venerable Cahiers du cin√©ma in 1964. Cahiers was in serious financial trouble and its owners convinced Filipacchi to buy a majority share in order to save it from ruin. Filipacchi hired a number of his own people and redesigned the journal to look more modern, zippy, and youth-appealing. After the revolutionary May 1968 events in France and the subsequent evolution of Cahiers into a more political forum under the influence of the Maoist director Jean-Luc Godard and others, Filipacchi wanted out of the magazine and sold his share in 1969. He started more magazines and acquired many others, such as Paris Match in 1976.

After running a medical practice for several years, MacMillan entered politics in 1923 winning a seat in the provincial legislative assembly as a Conservative. In 1932 he became the province's first minister of health and education. As minister he rebuilt Prince of Wales College and the Provincial Mental Hospital which had both been destroyed by fire. He also secured a Carnegie Foundation endowment that enabled the government to establish a provincial library system. When James D. Stewart became ill, MacMillan served as acting premier and then became the 18th premier when Stewart died in 1933. MacMillan's government implemented relief programs and increasing government spending to help dampen the impact of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, his government was swept from power in the 1935 election which saw the Liberals capture every seat in the legislature. He returned to the legislature in 1939 and remained leader of the Conservative Party until the late 1940s and a member of the legislature until he lost his seat in the 1955 election. MacMillan was named the province's lieutenant governor on November 22, 1957 but died before being sworn in. 1881 births 1957 deaths People from Prince County, Prince Edward Island Premiers of Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island MLAs Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island leaders Prince of Wales College alumni McGill University Faculty of Medicine alumni ","title":"William J.

It was the Protestants' first major victory of the Thirty Years War. The victory confirmed Sweden's Gustavus Adolphus of the House of Vasa as a great tactical leader and induced many Protestant German states to ally with Sweden against the German Catholic League, led by Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, and the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II.  Preliminaries  The Swedish phase of the Thirty Years War began when Gustavus Adolphus and his force of 13,000 landed at Peenem√ºnde in 1630. Initially, Sweden's entrance into the war was considered a minor annoyance to the Catholic League and its allies; his only battles to this point had been inconclusive ones, or fought against generals of modest military ability. Consequently, the Imperial Commander of the German Catholic League, Tilly, did not immediately respond to the arrival of the Swedes, being engaged in northern Italy. However, the effective end of the Mantuan War in 1631 ensured that the large Imperial army previously tied up there was now free to move into the German states. = Creating alliances = Contemporary etching of troop disposition at the beginning of the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631). When the Protestant princes showed little interest in attaching themselves to the Swedish cause, Gustavus opted for ‚Äúrough wooing.‚Äù His troops moved south into Brandenburg, taking and sacking the towns of K√ºstrin and Frankfurt an der Oder. It was too late and too far to save one of Gustav's ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù allies, Magdeburg, from a horrific sack by Imperial troops, beginning on 20 May, in which a major portion of the population was murdered and the city burned. The Swedes turned the sack of Magdeburg to good use: broadsides and pamphlets distributed throughout Europe ensured that prince and pauper alike understood how the Emperor, or at least his troops, treated his Protestant subjects. Over the next few months, Gustavus consolidated his bridgehead and expanded across northern Germany, attracting support from German princes and building his army from mercenary forces along the way. By the time he reached the Saxon border, his force had grown to over 23,000 men. = Strategic importance of Saxony = In order for Swedes to attack the Imperial troops in the south, they needed to pass through Saxony. In order for Tilly's forces to attack Gustav's army, they too needed to pass through Saxony. The Electorate of Saxony had not been affected by war and had large quantities of resources that each army could utilise. In midsummer, General Tilly asked John George I for permission to pass through the territory; the elector declined permission, noting that Saxony had not been ravaged by war yet. Later Tilly invaded the Electorate of Saxony due to the fact that it was the shortest distance between his army and Gustav's and it possibly annulled the chance of a potential alliance between Saxony and the Imperials. His plan was to avoid contact with the Swedes, and ultimately the Saxons, until his troops could unite with the units near Jena (about 5,000 seasoned professionals), and the larger force of Count Otto von Fugger, en route from Hesse. Gustav and John George united their forces, planning to meet Tilly somewhere near Leipzig.  Tactical overview  In this contemporary drawing, the Imperial formations (to the left) are deployed two companies deep, while the Swedish (to the right) are deployed just one company deep. Note the number of rank of flags in the stylized drawing of pike and shot. The battle was overall a meeting engagement with both combatants agreeing to battle on the field. The forces all had different structural organization. The level of technology was roughly equivalent, with newer, lighter cannon and matchlocks giving the Swedes a slight advantage. Both armies were well supplied, and the terrain gave neither a distinct advantage. =Forces deployed= The forces deployed were roughly equal in strength with the Swedes being slightly outnumbered. The Protestant coalition fielded about 42,000 troops (18,000 of them German), and the Imperial army about 35,000. The Protestants had a considerable edge in cavalry numbers, about 13,000 (5,000 from Allies) to 9,000. Strength of heavy artillery was comparable, with the Swedes having a slight edge in quality and Imperial forces a marginal advantage in quantity. The Swedes had additional small artillery pieces (3 and 6 pounders) integrated into their infantry brigades and regiments, giving them a larger number of tubes overall and a huge firepower advantage in an infantry clash. The Imperials had a considerable advantage in the number of trained infantry deployed, about 25,000 to the Swedes 15,000. The Saxons (Swedish allies) fielded about 9,000 untrained conscripts and militiamen, and had very few muskets. The Swedish brigade had more muskets and fewer pikemen than the Imperial tercios (who still retained large numbers of lighter firearms known as the arquebus or caliver); overall, the Protestants fielded about the same number of muskets as Imperial troops. = Force assessment = The overall balance was relatively even. The disparity in overall numbers resulted from large levies of untrained soldiers. The number of heavy cannon was relatively close, with the Swedish having newer models and light cannon compensating for the disparity in heavy field pieces. The Swedes had a considerable advantage in cavalry numbers, although the Imperialist cavalry were better armored and better mounted. This balance would be tilted however by the Swedish practice of supporting their cavalry with detachment of musketeers. Tilly also had a considerable numerical advantage in the number of veteran, trained infantry. Gustavus had a considerable advantage in his artillery arm; he had moved away from heavy siege artillery into more mobile field pieces, which because of its mobility and rate of fire were pound by pound much more effective than the latter. The Swedes also fielded considerably more powerful muskets by ratio, had far more advanced equipment, and better drills to increase their rate of fire. More important, the Linear Formation allowed most Swedish musketeers to fire at the same time, and allowed the Swedish infantry to match the Imperialist frontage with a smaller number of men, which would be crucial in the later phase of the battle. Finally, the Swedish aggressive assault method of firing by triple-ranked salvos at point blank range, compared to the Imperialist's more traditional way of firing by volley would prove to be a nasty shock to Tilly's tercios.  Disposition of forces  Battle of Breitenfeld ‚Äì Initial dispositions, 17 September 1631 Swedish-Saxon forces in Blue Catholic army in Red The Swedes deployed their 15,000 infantry in brigades and two lines. The imperial army deployed 25,500 infantry in a single line of 17 tercios (1,500 infantrymen in each). The German allies extended the Swedish- Saxon front to be overall slightly longer than the Imperial. The imperial line had its cavalry evenly distributed on its flanks. The Swedes had their cavalry weighted to their right. The Saxon allies fielded their infantry in wedge formation with units in squares, and cavalry on their flanks. With their Saxon allies extending the Swedes' line, the Protestants had cavalry at the centre and their flanks.  Battle  The battle started in the middle of the day and lasted over six hours. The first two hours consisted of an exchange of artillery fire. This was followed by an Imperial attack with cavalry from both wings to both ends of the Protestant line. The cavalry attack routed the Saxon troops on the Swedish left flank. The Imperial army then conducted a general attack to exploit the exposed left flank. The Swedes repositioned their second line to cover the left flank and counterattacked with their cavalry to both imperial flanks. The attack on the Imperial left was led personally by Gustavus Adolphus, capturing the Imperial artillery and enveloping the Imperial left flank. The Swedes now had much greater weight of fire from their artillery, infantry, and the captured Imperial artillery. The Imperial line became disorganized under the heavy fire and was enveloped. The Imperial line collapsed and over 80% of Imperial forces were killed or captured. = Opening moves = Battle of Breitenfeld ‚Äì Opening moves, 17 September 1631 Swedish-Saxon forces in Blue Catholic army in Red The combined Swedish-Saxon forces were to the north of Leipzig centred around hamlet of Podelwitz, facing southwest toward Breitenfeld and Leipzig. The battle began around mid-day, with a two-hour exchange of artillery fire, during which the Swedes demonstrated firepower in a rate of fire of three to five volleys to one Imperial volley. Gustavus had lightened his artillery park, and each colonel had four highly mobile, rapid firing, bronze-cast three pounders, the cream of Sweden's metallurgical industry. When the artillery fire ceased, Pappenheim's Black Cuirassiers charged without orders from Tilly, attempting to turn the Swedish right. Instead, their attack fell between Johan Ban√©r's line and the Swedish reserves. They attacked six times to little effect; the small companies of musketeers dispersed between the squadrons of Swedish horse fired salvos at point blank range, disrupting the charge of the Imperialist cuirassier and allowing the Swedish cavalry to counterattack at an advantage. The same tactics worked an hour or so later when the Imperial cavalry charged the Swedish left flank. Following the rebuff of the seventh assault, General Ban√©r sallied forth with both his light (Finnish and West Gaetlanders) and heavy cavalry (Smalanders and East Gaetlanders), forcing Pappenheim and his cavalry to quit the field in disarray, retreating 15 miles northwest to Halle. During the charges of the Imperialist cuirassiers, Tilly's infantry had remained stationary, but then the cavalry on his right charged the Saxon cavalry and routed it towards Eilenburg. There may have been confusion in the Imperial command at seeing Pappenheim's charge; in their assessment of the battle, military historians have wondered if Pappenheim precipitated an attempted double envelopment, or if he followed Tilly's preconceived plan. At any rate, recognizing an opportunity, Tilly sent the majority of his infantry against the remaining Saxon forces in an oblique march diagonally across his front. Battle of Breitenfeld ‚Äì Thwarting the Imperial attack, 17 September 1631 Swedish forces in Blue Catholic army in Red Battle of Breitenfeld ‚Äì Annihilation, 17 September 1631 Swedish forces in Blue Catholic army in Red = Thwarting the Imperial attack = Tilly ordered his infantry to march ahead diagonally to the right, concentrating his forces on the weaker Saxon flank. The entire Saxon force was routed, leaving the Swedish left flank exposed. Before the Imperial forces could regroup and change face towards the Swedes, the commander of the Swedish Left, Marshal Gustav Horn, refused his line and counter-attacked before the tercios could regroup and change face. The Imperialist tercios then faced the full brunt of the new Swedish firepower for the first time: > \\"...[Tilly] received a horrible, uninterrupted pounding from the king's > light pieces and was prevented from coming to grips with the latter's > forces.\\" ‚Äì Raimondo Montecuccoli, Imperial officer. > \\"First (saith he), giving fire unto three little Field-pieces that I had > before me, I suffered not my muskettiers to give their volleyes till I came > within Pistollshot of the enemy, at which time I gave order to the first > rancks to discharge at once, and after them the other three: which done we > fell pell mell into their ranckes, knocking them downe with the stocke of > the Musket and our swords.\\" ‚Äì Lt. Colonel Muschamp = Annihilation of the Imperial force = With the Imperial forces engaged, the Swedish right and centre pivoted on the refused angle, bringing them in line with Horn. Ban√©r's cavalry, under the direct command of Gustavus Adolphus, attacked across the former front to strike the Imperial left and capture their artillery. As Tilly's men came under fire from their own captured batteries, the Swedish cannon, under Lennart Torstensson, rotated, catching the tercios in a crossfire. After several hours of punishment, nearing sunset, the Catholic line finally broke. Tilly and Pappenheim were both wounded, though they escaped. 7,600 Imperial soldiers were killed, and 6,000 were captured. The Saxon artillery was recaptured, along with all the Imperial guns and 120 regimental flags.  Aftermath  The outcome of the battle had a significant impact in both the short and long terms. = Short- term effect = In the short term, the Catholic and Imperial forces were significantly hampered by the loss of most of the force. One hundred and twenty standards of the Imperial and Bavarian armies were taken (and are still on display in the Riddarholm church in Stockholm). After the battle, Gustavus moved on Halle, following the same track that Tilly had taken coming east to enforce the Edict of Restitution on the Electorate of Saxony. Two days later Gustav's forces captured another 3,000 men after a brief skirmish at Merseburg, and took Halle two days after that. After the battle, the Catholic League or Imperial army under Tilly could field an army of only 7,000 men. The army had to be rebuilt. Gustavus Adolphus, on the other hand, had a larger army after the battle than before. The battle's outcome had the political effect of convincing Protestant German states to join his cause. Finally, with the seventy-two-year-old Tilly's recovery far from certain (and he did indeed die within six months while crossing the Lech river), and with no alternative commander at hand, Emperor Ferdinand II had no choice but to rehire Wallenstein. = Long-term consequences = The totality of the victory confirmed Gustav's military innovations and guaranteed that the Swedes would remain engaged in the war for the foreseeable future. In the long term, the significant loss of forces and the creation of a strong Protestant anti- Imperial force required the Emperor and the Protestant and Catholic princes to rethink on the operational conduct of the war, and the diplomatic avenues they would pursue with it. Gustav's success encouraged several other princes to join the cause of the Swedish king and his few allies. By the month's end, Hanover, the Hessian dukes, Brandenburg and Saxony were officially aligned against the empire, and France had agreed to provide substantially greater funding for Gustavus' armies. Although Gustavus was killed a year later at the Battle of L√ºtzen, the military strength of the alliance had been secured through the addition of new armies. Even when Swedish leadership faltered it did not fail, and the influx of French gold ensured that the hostilities could continue.

It is commonly known as the \\"Dambusters\\", for its actions during Operation Chastise against German dams during the Second World War. In the early 21st century it operated the Panavia Tornado GR4 in the ground attack and reconnaissance role until being disbanded on 28 March 2014. The squadron reformed on 18 April 2018, and was equipped at RAF Marham in June 2018 with the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning, becoming the first squadron to be based in the UK with this advanced V/STOL type. History =Between the wars= According to the squadron's entry in Flying Units of the RAF by Alan Lake, No. 617 Squadron was allocated the unit identification code MZ for the period April to September 1939, even though the unit did not actually exist at the time. =Second World War= The squadron was formed under great secrecy at RAF Scampton during the Second World War on 21 March 1943. It included Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel and was formed for the specific task of attacking three major dams that contributed water and power to the Ruhr industrial region in Germany: the M√∂hne, Eder and Sorpe. The plan was given the codename Operation Chastise and carried out on 17 May 1943. The squadron had to develop the tactics to deploy Barnes Wallis's \\"Bouncing bomb\\", and undertook some of its training over the dams of the Upper Derwent Valley in Derbyshire, as the towers on the dam walls were similar to those to be found on some of the target dams in Germany. The squadron's badge, approved by King George VI, depicts the bursting of a dam in commemoration of Chastise. The squadron's chosen motto was \\"Apr√®s moi le d√©luge\\" (\\"After me, the flood\\"), a humorous double entendre on a famous saying of Madame de Pompadour to King Louis XV, made on the loss at the Battle of Rossbach by the French. The original commander of No. 617 Squadron, Wing Commander Guy Gibson, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the raid. Guy Gibson also owned a black Labrador named Nigger, who was the mascot of the squadron for some time. Nigger was run over and killed outside the base on the evening of the raid. King George VI visiting No. 617 Squadron in 1943 After the raid, Gibson was withdrawn from flying (due to the high number of raids he had been on) and went on a publicity tour. George Holden became commanding officer (CO) in July, but he was shot down and killed on his fourth mission, Operation Garlic in September 1943, in an attack on the Dortmund-Ems Canal; he had four of Gibson's crew with him. H. B. \\"Mick\\" Martin took command temporarily, before Leonard Cheshire took over as CO. Cheshire developed and personally took part in the special target marking techniques required, which went far beyond the precision delivered by the standard Pathfinder units ‚Äì by the end he was marking the targets from a Mustang fighter. He was also awarded the VC. On 15 July 1943, 12 aircraft of the squadron took off from Scampton to attack targets in Northern Italy. All aircraft attacked and proceeded to North Africa without loss. The targets were San Polo d'Enza and Arquata Scrivia power stations; it was hoped that the attacks would delay German troops who were travelling down into Italy on the electrified railway system to support the Italian front. The operation met little opposition but the targets were obscured by valley haze and were not destroyed. The 12 crews returned to Scampton on 25 July from North Africa after bombing Leghorn docks on the return journey. The raid on Leghorn Docks was not a great success, due to mist shrouding the target. On 29 July 1943 nine aircraft took off from Scampton to drop leaflets on Milan, Bologna, Genoa and Turin in Italy. All aircraft completed the mission and landed safely in Blida, North Africa. The UK Government considered using No. 617 Squadron to target the Italian leader Mussolini in July or August 1943. The British believed if Mussolini was killed it might take Italy out of the war. It would have been a flight carried out at extremely low level with the targets of Mussolini's headquarters and residence in Rome. Neither of these targets were within 1,500 yards of the Vatican, which the Allies had promised not to damage. However within two weeks of the plan being suggested, Mussolini was ousted by his opponents and replaced by Pietro Badoglio, leading to an armistice with the Allies in September. Throughout the rest of the war, the squadron continued in a specialist and precision-bombing role, including the use of the enormous \\"Tallboy\\" and \\"Grand Slam\\" ground-penetrating earthquake bombs, on targets such as concrete U-boat shelters and bridges. Several failed attempts were made on The Dortmund-Ems Canal in 1943 (Operation Garlic); it was finally breached with Tallboys in September 1944. In March 1945 the squadron used the Grand Slam bomb for the first time, against the Bielefeld viaduct, wrecking it. The viaduct had withstood 54 previous attacks without being permanently neutralized. No. 617 Squadron Avro Lancaster B.I EE146 at RAF Woodhall Spa with her crew (including OC Wg. Cdr. J. B.

A particularly notable series of attacks caused the disabling and sinking of Tirpitz, a major German battleship that had been moved into a fjord in northern Norway where she threatened the Arctic convoys and was too far north to be attacked by air from the UK. She had already been damaged by an attack by Royal Navy midget submarines and a series of attacks from carrier-borne aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, but both attacks had failed to sink her. The task was given to No. IX and No. 617 Squadrons; they were deployed to Yagodnik, near Archangel a staging base in Russia to attack Tirpitz with Tallboy bombs. On 15 September 1944, the RAF bombers struck the battleship in the forecastle, which rendered her unseaworthy, so she was sent to the Troms√∏ fjord where temporary repairs were made so she was anchored as a floating battery. This fjord was in range of bombers operating from Scotland and from there, in October, she was attacked again, but cloud cover thwarted the attack. Finally on 12 November 1944, the two squadrons attacked Tirpitz. The first bombs missed their target, but following aircraft scored two direct hits in quick succession. Within ten minutes of the first bomb hitting the Tirpitz, she suffered a magazine explosion at her \\"C\\" turret and capsized killing 1,000 of her 1,700 crew. All three RAF attacks on Tirpitz were led by Wing Commander J. B. \\"Willy\\" Tait, who had succeeded Cheshire as CO of No. 617 Squadron in July 1944.Bomber Command: Tirpitz, 12 November 1944, Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary web site Among pilots participating in the raids was Flight Lieutenant John Leavitt, an American who piloted one of the 31 Lancasters.

Despite both squadrons claiming that it was their bombs that actually sank the Tirpitz, it was the Tallboy bomb, dropped from a No. IX Squadron Lancaster WS-Y (LM220) piloted by Flying Officer Dougie Tweddle that is attributed to the sinking of the warship. F/O Tweddle was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in the operations against Tirpitz.

Following the transfer of responsibility for the nuclear deterrent to the Royal Navy, the squadron was reassigned to SACEUR for tactical strike missions. In a high-intensity European war the squadron's role was to support land forces on the Continent by striking deep into enemy-held areas beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, striking at enemy concentrations and infrastructure, with WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons, should a conflict escalate to that stage. The squadron's eight aircraft were allocated eight WE.177 nuclear bombs. As the Vulcan's bomb bay was configured to carry only one, and assuming that RAF staff planners had factored in their usual allowance for attrition in the early conventional phase of a continental war, leaving sufficient surviving aircraft to deliver the full stockpile of nuclear weapons, it is a reasonable conclusion that the Vulcan force was held in reserve for nuclear strike duties only. The squadron's Vulcan B2s served mainly in that low-level penetration role until disbandment on 31 December 1981. =Tornado GR (1983‚Äì2014)= Tornado GR4 ZA412 in special markings for the 70th Anniversary of the Dams raid at left The squadron reformed on 1 January 1983 at RAF Marham, re-equipped with twelve Panavia Tornado GR1.

A fight broke out between Colorado state militia and a group of striking coal miners, during which the unarmed miners were attacked with firearms. The miners testified that machine guns were fired at them, which the state police disputed. Six strikers were killed, and dozens were injured.  Background  The company town of Serene, Colorado, nestled on a rolling hillside, was the home of the Columbine mine. The strike was five weeks old and strikers had been conducting morning rallies at Serene for two weeks, for the Columbine was one of the few coal mines in the state to remain in operation. On November 21, 1927, five hundred miners, some accompanied by their wives and children, arrived at the north gate just before dawn. They carried three flags of the United States. At the direction of Josephine Roche, daughter of the recently deceased owner of the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, the picketers had been served coffee and doughnuts on previous mornings. That morning, the recently disbanded state police known as the Colorado Rangers were recalled to duty and would meet the picketers and bar their path. The miners were surprised to see men dressed in civilian clothes, but armed with machine pistols, rifles, riot guns and tear gas grenades. The Rangers were backed up by rifle-toting mine guards stationed on the mine dump. The Head of the Rangers, Louis Scherf, shouted to the strikers, \\"Who are your leaders?\\" \\"We're all leaders!\\" came the reply. Scherf announced that the strikers would not be allowed into the town, and for a few moments the strikers hesitated outside the fence. There was discussion, with many of the strikers asserting their right to proceed. Serene had a public post office, they argued, and some of their children were enrolled in the school in Serene. One of the Rangers was reported to have taunted, \\"If you want to come in here, come ahead, but we'll carry you out.\\" Strike leader Adam Bell stepped forward and asked for the gate to be unlocked. As he put his hand on the gate, one of the Rangers struck him with a club. A sixteen-year-old boy stood nearby and was holding one of the flags. The banner was snatched from him, and in the tug of war that followed, the flagpole broke over the fence. The miners rushed toward the gate, and suddenly the air was filled with tear gas launched by the police. A tear gas grenade hit Mrs. Kubic in the back, as she tried to get away. Some of the miners threw the tear gas grenades back. The miners in the front of the group scaled the gate, led by Adam Bell's call of \\"Come on!\\" Bell was pulled down by three policemen. Viciously clubbed on the head, he fell unconscious to the ground. A battle raged over his prostrate form, the miners shielding him from the Rangers. Mrs. Elizabeth Beranek, mother of 16 children and one of the flag-bearers, tried to protect him by thrusting her flag in front of his attackers. The police turned on her, bruising her severely. Rangers reportedly seized Mrs. Beranek's flag too. Police admitted to using clubs in the skirmish. In Scherf's words, \\"We knocked them down as fast as they came over the gate.\\" Miners would later say that the clubs were lengths of gas pipe. A striker belted one Ranger in the face, breaking his nose. A pocketknife-wielding miner cut another on the hand, while other strikers pelted the Rangers with rocks. Blood gushed from a cut above one Ranger's eye, when a rock found its mark. The police then retreated. Massacre Enraged, the strikers forced their way through the wooden gate. Jerry Davis grabbed one of the fallen flags, as hundreds of angry miners surged through the entrance. Others scaled the fence east of the gate. The police retreated, forming two lines at the water tank; inside the fence. Louis Scherf fired two .45 caliber rounds over the heads of the strikers. His men responded with deadly fire directly into the crowd. The miners scattered. Twelve remained on the ground: some dead, some injured. At least two, and possibly three machine guns were available at the mine. Miners later claimed that their ranks were decimated by a withering crossfire from the mine tipple - a structure where coal was loaded onto railroad cars - and from a gun on a truck near the water tank. John Eastenes, 34, of Lafayette, married and father of six children, died instantly. Nick Spanudakhis, 34, of Lafayette, lived only a few minutes. Frank Kovich of Erie, Rene Jacques, 26, of Louisville and 21-year-old Jerry Davis died hours later in the hospital. The Flag of the United States Davis carried was riddled with seventeen bullet holes and stained with blood. Mike Vidovich of Erie, 35, died a week later of his injuries. Aftermath The state police later testified that they had not used machine guns in the fight. The miners and some witnesses testified that machine guns were used. Some witnesses identified a mine guard who had climbed the tipple and may have operated the machine gun mounted there, providing one possible explanation for the discrepancy in testimony. However, the machine gun near the watertank was reportedly manned by one of Scherf's men.Once A Coalminer...

He worked on it intermittently from 1897 through 1908. Twain wrote multiple versions of the story; each involves a supernatural character called \\"Satan\\" or \\"No. 44\\". All the versions remained unfinished (with the debatable exception of the last one, No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger).

Edited by William M. Gibson. Kindle Edition. = The Chronicle of Young Satan = The first substantial version is entitled The Chronicle of Young Satan (also referred to as \\"Eseldorf\\" version) and relates the adventures of Satan, the sinless nephew of the biblical Satan, in Eseldorf, an Austrian village in the year 1702.

It is set in the US and involves the familiar characters Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer and their adventures with Satan, referred to in this version as \\"No. 44, New Series 864962\\". Twain began writing it in November 1898 and, like the \\"St. Petersburg Fragment\\", set it in the fictional town of St. Petersburg. = No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger = The third text, called No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger: Being an Ancient Tale Found in a Jug and Freely Translated from the Jug, also known as the \\"Print Shop\\" version, returns to Austria, this time in the year 1490, not long after the invention of printing. It tells of No. 44's mysterious appearance at the door of a print shop and his use of heavenly powers to expose the futility of mankind's existence. This version also introduces an idea Twain was toying with at the end of his life involving a duality of the \\"self\\", composed of the \\"Waking Self\\" and the \\"Dream Self\\". Twain explores these ideas through the use of \\"Duplicates\\", copies of the print shop workers made by No. 44. This version contains an actual ending; however, the text still has many flaws and it is debatable whether it can be considered finished.William M. Gibson: \\"All these developments take place in something like a dramatic vacuum\\" ... \\"Still 'diffusive' and disjointed.\\" Mark Twain. The Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Kindle Locations 143-147). Edited by William M. Gibson. Kindle Edition. Twain wrote this version between 1902 and 1908.  Paine-Duneka text of 1916  The edition published in 1916 (in seven parts in Harper's Magazine, and separately as a book published by Harpers) is composed mainly of a heavily-edited Chronicle of Young Satan, with a slightly altered version of the ending from No. 44 tacked on. Albert Bigelow Paine, who had sole possession of Twain's unfinished works after Twain's death and kept them private, claimed that he had searched through Twain's manuscripts and had found the proper intended ending for The Mysterious Stranger. After Paine's death in 1937, Bernard DeVoto became the possessor of Twain's manuscripts and released them to the public. In the 1960s, critics studied the original copies of the story and found that the ending Paine chose for The Mysterious Stranger referred to the characters from different versions of the story (such as No. 44 instead of Satan) and the original names had been crossed out and written over in Paine's handwriting.Mark Twain. The Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Kindle Locations 57-58). Edited by William M. Gibson. Kindle Edition. In 1963, scholars led by researcher John S. Tuckey carefully examined Twain's papers and manuscripts and discovered that Paine had not only tampered with and patched together three previously unfinished manuscripts but also had with assistance from Frederick Duneka added passages not written by Twain in order to complete The Mysterious Stranger. In addition to omitting a quarter of the original text, Paine's version invents the character of an astrologer who is made responsible for the villainies of Father Adolf. The book version that was published nonetheless maintains Twain's criticisms of what he believed to be the hypocrisy of conventional religion. According to editor W. M. Gibson, Paine's volume was a literary fraud that went undetected for more than 40 years.Mark Twain. The Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Kindle Locations 38-39). Edited by William M. Gibson. Kindle Edition. Nevertheless, Gibson also admits that \\"the cut, cobbled-together, partially falsified text has the power to move and to satisfy esthetically despite its flaws.\\"Mark Twain. The Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Kindle Locations 390-391). Edited by William M. Gibson. Kindle Edition. = Summary = In 1590, three boys, Theodor, Seppi, and Nikolaus, live relatively happy simple lives in a remote Austrian village called Eseldorf (German for \\"Assville\\" or \\"Donkeytown\\"). The story is narrated by Theodor, the village organist's son. Other local characters include Father Peter, his niece Marget, and the astrologer. One day, a handsome teenage boy named Satan appears in the village. He explains that he is an angel and the nephew of the fallen angel whose name he shares. Young Satan performs several magical feats. He claims to be able to foresee the future and informs the group of unfortunate events that will soon befall those they care about. The boys do not believe Satan's claims until one of his predictions comes true. Satan proceeds to describe further tragedies that will befall their friends. The boys beg Satan to intercede. Satan agrees but operates under the technical definition of mercy. For instance, instead of a lingering death due to illness, Satan simply causes one of Theodor's friends to die immediately. In the village and in other places around the world where Satan transports them magically, the boys witness religious fanaticism, witch-trials, burnings, hangings, deaths and mass-hysteria. Finally, Satan vanishes with a brief explanation: \\"[T]here is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream ‚Äì a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought ‚Äì a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!\\".  University of California Press editions  In 1969, the University of California Press published, as part of The Mark Twain Papers Series, a scholarly edition of all three unaltered manuscripts, edited by William M. Gibson and titled Mark Twain's Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts; it was republished in 2005. The University of California Press also released a final version of No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger in a popular edition in 1982.  Adaptations  = Film versions = In 1982, a film version of No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger was shot by The Great Amwell Company and shown in the United States on PBS, and later on HBO directed by Peter H. Hunt. The role of 44 was played by Lance Kerwin, and August was played by Chris Makepeace. A scene from The Chronicle of Young Satan was adapted in the 1985 claymation film The Adventures of Mark Twain, wherein Satan invites Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn, and Becky Thatcher to his company, displaying his powers to manifest things at will. He invites them to construct small clay people, which he brings to life and places in a small kingdom. Satan expresses curiosity and eventually spite toward their creations when the clay people display infighting and inflict cruelty on one another. He causes plagues and natural disasters to destroy the small community, buries the ruins with an earthquake, and causes wild vegetation to engulf the spot where the clay people once lived, demonstrating the futility and insignificance of mankind‚Äîmuch to the horror of the children, with Huck Finn uttering \\"You murdered them!\\" Satan advises them that \\"people are of no value\\" and that more could be made \\"if we need them\\". The scene also quotes Satan's last line from the book. In this version, Satan appears playful and friendly when he constructs the small kingdom, slowly revealing himself as cruel and hateful as he destroys it (although he claims he \\"can do no wrong\\" since he does not understand the word's meaning). He appears as a robed, headless figure with a mask where his head would be. As his true nature is revealed, the mask gradually changes from a pleasant appearance to a demonic visage and finally a grinning skull. In 1989, a film adaptation of this book was shot in the Soviet Union by Igor Maslennikov and released under the title Filipp Traum (Philipp Traum is the name Satan comes to use amongst humans, Traum being the German word for \\"dream\\"). The 2020 acid western movie Day of the Stranger is a loose adaptation of the story in a western setting. = Opera = Kevin Malone's opera Mysterious 44 is inspired by the work. The premi√®re, performed by Manchester Opera Project with a narrated introduction and conclusion by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, was at the residence of the Hall√© Orchestra at St Peter's Church, Ancoats, Manchester, on 24 May 2014.

The battle was a decisive victory for the Swedish army under the command of Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson over an Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire under the command of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and his deputy, Prince-General Ottavio Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi.The second battle was 11 years after the first battle at the crossroads village had unbottled the Swedish forces under Gustavus II Adolphus wherein he had handed Field Marshal Count Tilly his first major defeat in fifty years of soldiering on the same plain. The battle Map of the battle. In this second clash between ideologies for the prized Saxon city of Leipzig, the Protestant allied forces, led by Torstensson, defeated an army of the Holy Roman Empire, led by Leopold and his deputy, Prince-General Piccolomini. The Imperials had 26,000 men and 46 guns, the Swedes 20,000 men and 70 guns. Like the first battle, the second was a decisive victory for Swedish-led forces who had intervened in the Thirty Years' War on behalf of various Protestant princes of the generally small German states against the German Catholic League formed to resist Protestant expansion in Central Europe. The Imperial army suffered 9,500 casualties, including 4,500 taken prisoner. The victors captured 46 guns. Killed or wounded were 4,000 Swedes; among them, General Torsten St√•lhandske, who led the Finnish Hakkapeliitta Cavalry, received a serious wound. Aftermath The battle, following a brief mop-up campaign ending with the Battle of Klingenthal, enabled Sweden to occupy Saxony. His defeat made Emperor Ferdinand III more willing to negotiate peace, and renounce the Preliminary of Hamburg. During the battle, Colonel Madlon's cavalry regiment was the first that fled without striking a blow. This was followed by the massive flight of other cavalry units, which was the final turning point in the battle. The battle was a decisive victory for the Swedish army under the command of Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson over an Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire under the command of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and his deputy, Prince-General Ottavio Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm assembled a court-martial in Prague which sentenced the Madlon regiment to exemplary punishment. Six regiments, which had distinguished themselves in the battle, were assembled fully armed and surrounded Madlon's regiment, which was severely rebuked for its cowardice and misconduct and ordered to lay down its arms at the feet of General Piccolomini. When they had obeyed that command, their ensigns (flags) were torn in pieces, and the general, having mentioned the causes of their degradation, and erased the regiment from the register of the imperial troops, pronounced the sentence that had been agreed upon in the council of war, condemning the colonel, captains and lieutenants to be beheaded, the ensigns (junior officers) to be hanged, the soldiers to be decimated and the survivors to be driven in disgrace out of the army. Ninety men (chosen by rolling dice) were executed at Rokycany, in western Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, on December 14, 1642 by Jan Mydl√°≈ô (junior), the son of Jan Mydl√°≈ô, the famous executioner from Prague. On the first day of the execution, the regiment's cords were broken by the executioner. On the second day, officers were beheaded and selected men hanged on the trees on the road from Rokycany to Litohlavy. Another version says that the soldiers were shot, and their bodies hanged on the trees. Their mass grave is said to be on the Black Mound in Rokycany, which commemorates the decimation to this day.

The original version was created by the writer-artist team of Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino, the character debuted in Flash Comics #86 (August 1947). One of DC's earliest super-heroines, the title Black Canary has appeared in many of the company's flagship team-up titles including Justice Society of America and Justice League of America. Since the late 1960s, the character has been paired with archer superhero Green Arrow, professionally and romantically. Black Canary has been adapted into various media. In Birds of Prey she was played by Rachel Skarsten, and in Smallville she was played by Alaina Huffman. In Arrow and the Arrowverse shows the characters Dinah Laurel Lance, Sara Lance and Dinah Drake are portrayed by Katie Cassidy, Caity Lotz and Juliana Harkavy. Dinah Lance made her cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film Birds of Prey, portrayed by Jurnee Smollett-Bell. Publication history Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino created the character in 1947 to be featured in Flash Comics as a supporting character. Appearing first as a clandestine crime-fighter who infiltrates criminal organizations to break them from the inside, Black Canary was drawn with fishnet stockings and a black leather jacket to connote images of a sexualized yet strong female character. She appeared as a character in a back-up story featuring \\"Johnny Thunder\\": According to Amash & Nolen- Weathington (2010), Black Canary is \\"really\\" Carmine Infantino's \\"first character.\\" According to the artist: \\"When Kanigher gave me the script, I said, 'How do you want me to draw her?' He said, 'What's your fantasy of a good-looking girl? That's what I want.' Isn't that a great line? So that's what I did. I made her strong in character and sexy in form. The funny part is that years later, while in Korea on a National Cartoonists trip, I met a dancer who was the exact image of the Black Canary. And I went out with her for three years. Bob didn't ask me for a character sketch [for the Black Canary]. He had a lot of respect for me, I must say that. He always trusted my work... Bob loved my Black Canary design.\\" =Dinah Drake= At her Golden Age debut, Black Canary was the alter ego of Dinah Drake and participated in crime-fighting adventures with her love interest (and eventual husband), Gotham City detective Larry Lance. Initially, the character was a hand-to-hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs. Later stories depicted her as a world-class martial artist with a superpower: the \\"canary cry\\", a high-powered sonic scream which could shatter objects and incapacitate and even kill powerful foes. When DC Comics adjusted it's continuity, Black Canary was established as two separate entities: mother and daughter, Dinah Drake-Lance and Dinah Laurel Lance. Stories since the Silver Age focused on the younger Black Canary, ascribing her superhuman abilities to a genetic mutation. However, since the launch of the New 52, the two identities have been merged, with Dinah Drake possessing a metahuman cry. =Dinah Laurel Lance= Following the universe-altering events of Crisis on Infinite Earths (concluding in March 1986), Black Canary's history was revised again. The mind-transplant story of 1983 was discarded; in this version of the story, the present-day Black Canary is Dinah Laurel Lance, who inherits the identity from her mother, Dinah Drake Lance. Although some references (for example, those in James Robinson's Starman series) tried to distinguish the two Canaries by calling the first \\"Diana\\", recent accounts have confirmed Dinah as the mother's given name. The two Canaries' origin stories were told in full in Secret Origins #50 (August 1990). In this story, Dinah Drake is trained by her father, detective Richard Drake, intending to follow him on the Gotham City police force. When she is turned down, her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards. Determined to honor his memory, Dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means. She becomes a costumed vigilante, using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job. Dinah marries her lover, private eye Larry Lance, and several years later their daughter, Dinah Laurel Lance, is born (Birds of Prey #66 (June 2004) would establish that they took the name \\"Laurel\\" from a librarian Dinah befriended during a case). =The New 52 amalgam version = In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Dinah Drake is Black Canary (she later marries Kurt Lance). Dinah founds the Birds of Prey and recruits the team, beginning with her friend Ev Crawford, known as Starling. Eventually Katana and Poison Ivy join the team. Initially reluctant to join, Batgirl becomes a regular addition to the cast by the fourth issue of the series. Dinah joins Team 7 in a flashback and is drafted into the Justice League to assist in the \\"Throne of Atlantis\\" crossover, after which she remains a reserve member. Post-Flashpoint, Dinah Drake was born the child of a teenaged single mother, handed into foster care at the age of four. Considered a troublemaker, she moved from foster home to foster home and finally ran away at the age of ten. Taking to the streets of Gotham, she was caught dumpster- diving by Desmond Lamar, an ex-Special Forces agent and martial arts sensei, who took her in and offered her a job to clean his dojo after classes. In return, he would provide her with food and a safe place to sleep. At her request, Lamar took to teaching her the same skills he provided his students, and she became his regular. When Lamar contracted fatal brain cancer, he left her his dojo. Unfortunately, he was the only one who could keep the local gangs from getting protection money out of them. Dinah's martial arts prowess could only keep them at bay for so long. Eventually, she began losing students who feared the possibility of their retaliation. Flashbacks show that during Zero Year, Dinah's dojo was destroyed in a fire. It was at this point, John Lynch, impressed by her martial arts prowess in taking down several ninjas during an attack, recruited her into Team 7. During her tenure with Team 7, Dinah works as a covert ops agent in charge of infiltration. She is given the codename Operative Canary. It is during this time that Dinah secretly marries her longtime partner, Kurt Lance. Her powers are subsequently awakened after being tested metagene-positive. Toward the end of the Team 7 run, during a mission to retrieve Pandora's Box, Dinah's sonic scream surfaces and are amplified by Kurt's, the after-effect of which ultimately destroyed the island of Gamorra. In the aftermath, Kurt is presumed dead, and Team 7 is mothballed, leaving Dinah a fugitive on the run from authorities and an outlaw codenaming herself Black Canary. After Team 7, Black Canary continues freelance covert operations, hunting the terrorist network known as Basilisk, and later attempts to form a team recruiting Starling, Katana, Poison Ivy, and later Batgirl. The team is ambushed by treachery from Poison Ivy and eventually Starling, pressuring Dinah to question her leadership. As the team roster progresses and evolves following the departure of Katana to include Strix and Condor, Dinah's questioning reaches its peak to erupt trust issues and notably with Batgirl when she discovers her powers are being manipulated by an apparently alive Kurt Lance. Throughout her missions with the Birds, Dinah encounters and protects an elderly woman, Miss Ettie, later revealed to be known as Mother Eve, a centuries-old woman hunted by Ra's al Ghul for her immortality which takes place in the form of her metamorphosis into her youth after every life. She claims that in nearly every life, she was a mother and outlived her children, some of whom have developed unique abilities genetically, and believes that Dinah might have gained her abilities through a genetic link to her. When Dinah's husband Kurt is found to have no memory of his past life with her, and she realizes Amanda Waller is involved, she summons Waller to find answers during a mission against the Suicide Squad. Confronting Waller, she is informed that Kurt was revived by a Samsara Serum, and the resurrection process damaged his memory. With the truth of Dinah's past and her setting up of this meeting with Waller shared with the Birds, Batgirl confronts Dinah on her leadership and angrily disapproves of Dinah's actions in keeping it from the team. As a result, the Birds of Prey part ways. After a long rift, Dinah returns to apologize to Barbara and is forced to move in with her when her dojo is burned down (which was partially Barbara's fault). It is later revealed that Dinah has become the lead singer of a band called Ashes on Sunday. Black Canary's appearances on Batgirl lead to the spin-off Black Canary, which focuses on Dinah's attempts to balance a musical career with the frenzied life she leads as a vigilante. After her stint with Ashes on Sunday, Dinah received an offer from A&B; Records for an album and go on tour and joins a rock band she named Black Canary. As the lead singer of Black Canary, Dinah attempts to leave her past life behind and takes to the stage name D.D., joining the likes of drummer Lord Byron, keyboardist Paloma Terrific and mute guitarist Ditto, all of whom are accompanied by the band's tour manager, Heathcliff Ray. However, when her friends' lives are threatened, Dinah dedicates herself to training them in battle. Over the course of the title, Dinah learns more about her powers, which derive from an alien girl named Ditto, and finds that the frontwoman she replaced, Maeve, has been given identical powers by a criminal syndicate. The series ends with issue 12. Powers, abilities and equipment Although depictions of Black Canary have varied over the years, the characters are often portrayed as a prodigious hand-to-hand combatant, having mastered styles such as Aikido,Black Canary vol. 3 #2 (September 2007) Boxing, Capoeira, Hapkido, Judo,Green Arrow vol. 2 Annual #1 (September 1988)Batman: Secret Files and Origins #1 (October 1997)Birds of Prey vol. 1 #58 (October 2003) Jujutsu, Kung Fu, Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Shuri-te, and Wing Chun.JSA #14 (September 2000) She has been trained by other top-tier fighters, such as Wildcat, Lady Shiva, Cassandra Cain, and Wonder Woman, as well as having bested Batman, from time to time, in hand-to- hand combat. In addition to her martial arts skills, Black Canary has been depicted as an expert motorcyclist, gymnast, covert operative and investigator. She is also an excellent leader and tactician, having served as the field commander of the Birds of Prey and the leader of the Justice League and League of Assassins for a time. Her superpower, the canary cry, allows her to create ultrasonic vibrations whenever she screams, allowing her to severely damage both organic and inorganic objects. Her canary cry has been depicted as having ten-fold the capabilities of most sonic weapons and has even been depicted as breaking metals and having the resonance to affect and shatter the Earth. In the New 52, her canary cry now grants her the ability to glide and propel herself across long distances by screaming downwards. Due to this reliance on speech, she is often bound and gagged by villains as a means of incapacitation. Despite her power, Black Canary often relies on her martial arts skills instead, preferring to use her canary cry only during urgent situations, such as against superpowered opponents. The origin of Black Canary's canary cry has been retconned over the course of her character history, with it being originally depicted as magical in origin due to being cursed by the Wizard. Later, the cry is depicted as an inborn metahuman ability. As of the New 52, her ability is result of human experimentation by the executive leaders of Team 7, involving her being treated with genes from an alien girl named Ditto. Reception Black Canary is ranked the 71st- greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard, and IGN rated her its 81st-greatest all-time comic book hero. She was number 26 on Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. Other versions  In other media  Black Canary has appeared in live-action and animated adaptations of DC properties and in video games based on the comic books. = Television =  Live-action  Black Canary's first live-action appearance was Danuta Wesley's 1979 portrayal in NBC's two Legends of the Superheroes specials.

In the 2012 television series Arrow and other series set in its fictional universe, Dinah Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy) is an attorney, and commonly goes by the name Laurel. Her younger sister, Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) returns in season two after a six-year absence as a trained assassin for the League of Assassins, working alongside the Arrow (Stephen Amell) to protect Starling City as a masked vigilante, The Canary. When she is murdered in season three, Laurel takes up her sister's identity, operating as the Black Canary until her own murder in season four. In the spin-off show Legends of Tomorrow, a resurrected Sara Lance resumes heroism under the moniker White Canary as prompted by Laurel prior to her death. Cassidy later portrays Laurel's villainous Earth-Two metahuman doppelg√§nger, Black Siren, on The Flash, and also in the fifth season of Arrow. Cassidy reprises her role as Black Siren on season six of Arrow as a series regular, who gradually redeems herself after working alongside Green Arrow, eventually becoming the Black Canary of Earth-2 before that universe is destroyed. Cassidy also appears in The Flash episode \\"Fury Rogue\\" as Siren-X, a Nazi-affiliated Earth-X version of Laurel Lance. In its fifth season, Arrow introduces Dinah Drake (Juliana Harkavy) as the third vigilante to use the Black Canary name. Unrelated to the Lances, she is a former Central City Police Department officer who possesses a metahuman hypersonic cry similar to Black Siren's. Harkavy was promoted to series regular for season six. In September 2019, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that The CW was developing a female-led spin-off series, with Katherine McNamara (who played Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak's daughter, Mia Smoak), Katie Cassidy, and Juliana Harkavy as the leads, reprising their roles from Arrow.

Due to her knowing Cassandra Cain, she is convinced by detective Renee Montoya to be her informant on Sionis' operations, after the detective mentions that her mother, a hero who trained Dinah to be her successor, died in the line of duty. Dinah is determined to do what she can to bring down Sionis and not allow any harm to befall Cassandra, but she becomes a target once Sionis' right-hand man, Victor Zsasz, discovers her dealings with the police. She agrees to help Harley safeguard Cassandra, and uses her Canary Cry to incapacitate several of Sionis' men at once, allowing Harley to chase after him as he abducts Cassandra. After Sionis' defeat, she joins Renee and Helena Bertinelli to form the titular Birds of Prey, funded by Helena's recovered fortune. = Video games = Jennifer Hale and Grey DeLisle reprise the character in video games, appearing in Justice League Heroes for PlayStation Portable and Batman: The Brave and the Bold ‚Äì The Videogame respectively.

Bell was born in Cape Traverse, the son of Walter Bell and Elizabeth Howatt. He was educated at Prince of Wales College and at Albert College in Belleville. After studying law, he was called to the Ontario bar in 1874 and set up practice in Ottawa, Ontario. He moved to Manitoba, was called to the bar there and set up practice in Emerson. In 1882, he married his first cousin, Helen, the daughter of Cornelius Howatt. He returned to Prince Edward Island, was called to the bar, and set up practice in Summerside. Bell entered politics in 1886 when he was elected to the province's legislative assembly as a Liberal. In 1898 he won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a supporter of the federal Liberals under Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He lost his seat in 1900 but returned to the provincial assembly in 1915 when he was chosen to lead the Liberal Party and became leader of the opposition. After Bell led the Liberals to power in 1919, he became Premier. His government extended the province's road system and adopted a highway improvement policy funded by a tax that contributed to the government's unpopularity. His administration also extended the voting franchise to women in 1922. Bell's government was ridden with disputes within his cabinet, which harmed the party's unity and popularity and led to his government's electoral defeat in 1923 after a single term in office.

Gladstone appointed him Viceroy of India 1872‚Äì1876. His major accomplishments came as an energetic reformer who was dedicated to upgrading the quality of government in the British Raj. He began large scale famine relief, reduced taxes, and overcame bureaucratic obstacles in an effort to reduce both starvation and widespread social unrest.James S. Olson and Robert S. Shadle, Historical Dictionary of the British Empire (1996), p. 116. He served as First Lord of the Admiralty between 1880 and 1885. Background and education Northbrook was the eldest son of Francis Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook, by his first wife Jane, daughter of the Sir George Grey, 1st Baronet. He was educated at Twyford School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in 1846. Political career Northbrook entered upon a political career, and was successively private secretary to Henry Labouchere (Board of Trade), Sir George Grey (Home Office), and Sir Charles Wood (India Office and then Admiralty to 1857). In 1847 he served on the committee of the British Relief Association. In 1857, he was returned to the House of Commons for Penryn and Falmouth, which he represented until becoming a peer on the death of his father in 1866. He served under Lord Palmerston as Civil Lord of the Admiralty between 1857 and 1858, as Under-Secretary of State for War in 1861, as Under-Secretary of State for India between 1861 and 1864, under Palmerston and Lord Russell as Under- Secretary of State for the Home Department between 1864 and 1866 and under Russell as Secretary to the Admiralty in 1866. When William Ewart Gladstone acceded to power in 1868, Baring was again appointed Under-Secretary of State for War, and this office he held until February 1872, when he was appointed Viceroy of India. In January 1876, however, he resigned. He had recommended the conclusion of arrangements with Sher Ali Khan which, as has since been admitted, would have prevented the Second Afghan War; but his policy was overruled by the Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India. in 1876 he was created Viscount Baring, of Lee in the County of Kent, and Earl of Northbrook, in the County of Southampton.

From 1880 to 1885 Northbrook held the post of First Lord of the Admiralty in Gladstone's second government. During his tenure of office the state of the navy aroused much public anxiety and led to a strong agitation in favor of an extended shipbuilding programme. The agitation called forth Tennyson's poem The Fleet. In September 1884, Northbrook was sent to Egypt as special commissioner to inquire into its finances and condition. The inquiry was largely unnecessary, all the essential facts being well known, but the mission was a device of Gladstone's to avoid an immediate decision on a perplexing question. Northbrook, after six weeks of inquiry in Egypt, sent in two reports, one general, advising against the withdrawal of the British garrison, and one financial. His financial proposals, if accepted, would have substituted the financial control of Britain for the international control proposed at the London Conference of June‚ÄìAugust of the same year, but this was not carried out. When Gladstone formed his third ministry in 1886 Baring held aloof, being opposed to the Home Rule policy of the prime minister; and he then ceased to take a prominent part in political life.

The asteroid was named after Hermes from Greek mythology. It is noted for having been the last remaining named lost asteroid, rediscovered in 2003. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 13.9 hours. Its synchronous companion was discovered in 2003. The primary and secondary are similar in size; they measure approximately and in diameter, respectively.  Discovery  Hermes was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in images taken at Heidelberg Observatory on 28 October 1937. Only four days of observations could be made before it became too faint to be seen in the telescopes of the day. This was not enough to calculate an orbit, and Hermes became a lost asteroid. It thus did not receive a number, but Reinmuth nevertheless named it after the Greek god Hermes. It was the third unnumbered but named asteroid, having only the provisional designation . The two others long lost were (1862) Apollo, discovered in 1932 and numbered 1973, and (2101) Adonis, discovered in 1936 and numbered 1977.D. Schmadel, Dictionary of Minor Planet Names On 15 October 2003, Brian A. Skiff of the LONEOS project made an asteroid observation that, when the orbit was calculated backwards in time (by Timothy B. Spahr, Steven Chesley and Paul Chodas), turned out to be a rediscovery of Hermes. It has been assigned sequential number 69230. Additional precovery observations were published by the Minor Planet Center, the earliest being found by an amateur astronomer on images taken serendipitously by the MPG/ESO 2.2-m La Silla telescope on 16 September 2000.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Greek god Hermes, who is the messenger of the gods and son of Zeus and Maia (also see and ). Recovered and numbered in autumn 2003, Hermes was originally named by the Astronomical Calculation Institute as early as 1937. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 9 November 2003 ().  Orbit and classification  Hermes is an Apollo asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that cross the orbit of Earth. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6‚Äì2.7 AU once every 2 years and 2 months (778 days; semi-major axis of 1.66 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.62 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Due to its eccentricity, Hermes is also a Mars- and Venus-crosser. Frequent close approaches to both Earth and Venus make it unusually challenging to forecast its orbit more than a century in advance, though there is no known impact risk within that timeframe.https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at- nasa/2003/31oct_hermes \\"The Curious Tale of Asteroid Hermes.\\" Retrieved 27/12/2017. = Close approaches = Animation of 69230 Hermes's orbit - close approach in 1942 The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which translates into 1.6 LD. On 30 October 1937, Hermes passed from Earth, and on 26 April 1942, from Earth. In retrospect it turned out that Hermes came even closer to the Earth in 1942 than in 1937, within 1.7 lunar distances; the second pass was unobserved at the height of the Second World War. For decades, Hermes was known to have made the closest known approach of an asteroid to the Earth. Not until 1989 was a closer approach (by 4581 Asclepius) observed. At closest approach, Hermes was moving 5¬∞ per hour across the sky and reached 8th magnitude.  Physical characteristics  = Spectral type = Hermes is a stony S-type asteroid, as reported by Andy Rivkin and Richard Binzel. It has been characterized as a Sq-subtype using the SpeX instrument at NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. Sq-types transition to the Q-type asteroid. = Lightcurves = Three rotational lightcurves of Hermes were obtained from photometric observations in October 2003. Lightcurve analysis gave a well- defined rotation period between 13.892 and 13.894 hours with a brightness variation between and 0.06 and 0.08 magnitude, which indicates that the body has a nearly spherical shape ().  Binary system  Arecibo radar image from 19 October 2003, showing the relative motion of the components. Radar observations led by Jean-Luc Margot at Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone in October and November 2003 showed Hermes to be a binary asteroid. The primary and secondary components have nearly identical radii of and , respectively, and their orbital separation is only 1,200 metres, much smaller than the Hill radius of 35 km. The two components are in double synchronous rotation (similar to the trans-Neptunian system Pluto and Charon).

In 1972, he acquired the derelict Otto Wagner Villa in H√ºtteldorf, which he restored and transformed. The villa was inaugurated as the Ernst Fuchs Museum in 1988. Life and work Fuchs studied sculpture with Emmy Steinbock (1943), attended the St. Anna Painting School where he studied under Professor Fr√∂hlich (1944), and entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (1945) where he began his studies under Professor Robin C. Anderson, later moving to the class of Albert Paris von G√ºtersloh. At the Academy, he met Arik Brauer, Rudolf Hausner, Fritz Janschka, Wolfgang Hutter, and Anton Lehmden, together with whom he later founded what has become known as the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. He was also a founding member of the Art-Club (1946), as well as the Hundsgruppe, set up in opposition to it in 1951, together with Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Arnulf Rainer. Fuchs died at the age of 85 on November 9, 2015.\\"Austrian painter Ernst Fuchs dies aged 85.\\" Belfast Telegraph. Retrieved 9 November 2015. Fuchs was Austrian monarchist. He painted Emperor Franz Joseph I. and Otto von Habsburg.\\"Ernst Fuchs posthum als Monarchist geoutet\\" kurier. Retrieved 6 December 2018 Career Fuch's work of this period was influenced by the art of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele and then by Max Pechstein, Heinrich Campendonck, Edvard Munch, Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. During this time, seeking to achieve the vivid lighting effects achieved by such Old Masters as Albrecht Altdorfer, Albrecht D√ºrer, Matthias Gr√ºnewald and Martin Schongauer, he revived and adopted the mischtechnik (mixed technique) of painting. In the mischtechnik, egg tempera is used to build up volume, and is then glazed with oil paints mixed with resin, producing a jewel-like effect. Between 1950 and 1961, Fuchs lived mostly in Paris, and made a number of journeys to the United States and Israel. His favourite reading material at the time was the sermons of Meister Eckhart. He also studied the symbolism of the alchemists and read Jung's Psychology and Alchemy. His favourite examples at the time were the mannerists, especially Jacques Callot, and he was also very much influenced by Jan van Eyck and Jean Fouquet. In 1958 he founded the Galerie Fuchs-Fischoff in Vienna to promote and support the younger painters of the Fantastic Realism school. Together with Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Arnulf Rainer, he founded the Pintorarium. When he was 12 years old, he converted to Roman Catholicism (his mother had him baptized during the war in order to save him from being sent to a concentration camp). In 1957, he entered the Dormition Abbey on Mount Zion where he began work on his monumental Last Supper and devoted himself to producing small-sized paintings on religious themes such as Moses and the Burning Bush, culminating in a commission to paint three altar paintings on parchment, the cycle of the Mysteries of the Holy Rosary (1958‚Äì61), for the Rosenkranzkirche in Hetzendorf, Vienna. He also dealt with contemporary issues in his masterpiece of this period, Psalm 69 (1949‚Äì60). (Fuchs, 1978, p. 53). Fuchs returned to Vienna in 1961 and had a vision of what he called the verschollener Stil (Hidden Prime of Styles), the theory of which he set forth in his inspired and grandiose book Architectura Caelestis: Die Bilder des verschollenen Stils (Salzburg, 1966). He also produced several important cycles of prints, such as Unicorn (1950‚Äì52), Samson (1960‚Äì64), Esther (1964-7) and Sphinx (1966-7; all illustrated in Weis). In 1972, he acquired the derelict Otto Wagner Villa in H√ºtteldorf, which he restored and transformed. The villa was inaugurated as the Ernst Fuchs Museum in 1988. From 1970 on, he embarked on numerous sculptural projects such as Queen Esther (h. 2.63 m, 1972), located at the entrance to the museum, and also mounted on the radiator cap of the Cadillac at the entrance to the Dal√≠ Museum in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. Design projects From 1974, he became involved in designing stage sets and costumes for the operas of Mozart and Richard Wagner, including Die Zauberfl√∂te, Parsifal, and Lohengrin. He experimented with industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Fuchs decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's Studio Linie. In 1993, Fuchs was given a retrospective exhibition at the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, one of the first Western artists so honored.

A bracteate (from the Latin bractea, a thin piece of metal) is a flat, thin, single-sided gold medal worn as jewelry that was produced in Northern Europe predominantly during the Migration Period of the Germanic Iron Age (including the Vendel era in Sweden). The term is also used for thin discs, especially in gold, to be sewn onto clothing in the ancient world, as found for example in the ancient Persian Oxus treasure, and also later silver coins produced in central Europe during the Early Middle Ages. Gold bracteates from the Migration Period The Vadstena bracteate, a typical C-bracteate. Gold bracteates commonly denote a certain type of jewelry, made mainly in the 5th to 7th century AD, represented by numerous gold specimens. Bead-rimmed and fitted with a loop, most were intended to be worn suspended by a string around the neck, supposedly as an amulet. The gold for the bracteates came from coins paid as peace money by the Roman Empire to their Northern Germanic neighbors.Poul Kj√¶rum, Rikke Agnete Olsen. Oldtidens Ansigt: Faces of the Past (1990), =Motifs= B-bracteate of the B7 or \\"F√ºrstenberg\\" type, found in Welschingen (IK 389), interpreted as depicting Frija-Frigg. Many of the bracteates feature ruler portraits of Germanic kings with characteristic hair that is plaited back and depictions of figures from Germanic mythology influenced to varying extents by Roman coinage while others feature entirely new motifs. The motifs are commonly those of Germanic mythology and some are believed to be Germanic pagan icons giving protection or for divination. Often depicted is a figure with a horse, birds and sometimes a spear ‚Äì that some scholars interpret as a representation of the Germanic god Wodan ‚Äì and aspects of the figure that would later appear in 13th century depictions as Odin such as the Poetic Edda. For this reason the bracteates are a target of iconographic studies by scholars interested in Germanic religion. Several bracteates also feature runic alphabet inscriptions (a total of 133 inscriptions on bracteates are known, amounting to more than a third of the entire Elder Futhark corpus). Numerous Bracteates feature swastikas as a common motif. =Typology= The typology for bracteates divides them into several letter-named categories, a system introduced in an 1855 treatise by the Danish numismatist Christian J√ºrgensen Thomsen named Om Guldbracteaterne og Bracteaternes tidligste Brug som Mynt and finally defined formally by the Swedish numismatist Oscar Montelius in his 1869 treatise Fr√•n jern√•ldern: *A-bracteates (~92 specimens): showing the face of a human, modelled after antique imperial coins *B-bracteates (~91 specimens): one to three human figures in standing, sitting or kneeling positions, often accompanied by animals *C-bracteates (best represented, by ~426 specimens): showing a male's head above a quadruped, often interpreted as the Germanic god Woden. *D-bracteates (~359 specimens): showing one or more highly stylized animals *E-bracteates (~280 specimens): showing an animal triskele under a circular feature *F-bracteates (~17 specimens): as a subgroup of the D-bracteates, showing an imaginary animal *M-'bracteates' (~17 specimens): two-sided imitations of Roman imperial medallions =Corpus= More than 1,000 Migration Period bracteates of type A-, B-, C-, D-, and F are known in total (Heizmann & Axboe 2011). Of these, 135 (ca. 11%) bear Elder Futhark inscriptions which are often very short; the most notable inscriptions are found on the Seeland-II-C (offering traveling protection to the one who wears it), Vadstena (giving a listing of the Elder Futhark combined with a potential magical inscription) and Tjurk√∂ (featuring an inscription in scaldic verse) bracteates. To these can be added the ca. 270 E-bracteates (Gaimster 1998), which belong to the Vendel Period and thus are slightly later than the other types. They were produced only on Gotland, and while the earlier bracteates (apart from a few English pieces) all were made from gold, many E-bracteates were made from silver or bronze. The German historian Karl Hauck, Danish archaeologist Morten Axboe and German runologist Klaus D√ºwel have worked since the 1960s to create a complete corpus of the early Germanic bracteates from the migration period, complete with large scale photographs and drawings. This has been published in three volumes in German named Die Goldbrakteaten der V√∂lkerwanderungszeit. Ikonographischer Katalog. A catalogue supplement is included in Heizmann & Axboe 2011. Early medieval bracteates Silver bracteates (in German Brakteat, also called \\"hollow pennies\\": Hohlpfennige) are different from the migration period bracteates. They were the predominant regional coinage type minted in German-speaking areas (with the exception of Rhineland, Westphalia and the Middle Rhine region) beginning at around 1130 in Saxony and Thuringia and lasted well into the 14th century. From a currency point of view, bracteates were a typical \\"regional penny\\" currency of the time. Medieval silver bracteates are one-sided, embossed pennies from thin silver sheet, with a diameter of 22 to 45 mm. The coin image appears in a high relief, while the back remains hollow. The large area left much room for artistic representations. Usual were three denominations, a two-penny (Blaffert) with elaborate image, a one-penny (Hohlpfennig) with coarse image and hollow coins worth half a penny (Scherf). The bracteates were usually called back regularly, about once or twice a year, and must be exchanged for new coins (Renovatio Monetae). For example, receiving three new coins for four old coins. The withheld 4th coin was called strike money and was often the only tax revenue of the coin mint-master. This system worked like a demurrage: People wouldn't hoard their coins, because they lost their value. So, this money was used more as a medium of exchange than for storing value. This increased the velocity of money and stimulated the economy. This disruption disturbed the business interests of all those who were involved in the then money economy, namely the merchants who dominated in the German city leagues. The city leagues then introduced from 1413 a so-called Ewiger Pfennig (eternal penny). The last bracteates were \\"traveller bracteates\\", embossed medallions worn as a pendant, that served as a type of presence mark for pilgrims and were in use until the 17th century. In some cantons of Switzerland, bracteate- like rappen, heller, and angster were produced during the 18th century.

During the five years of 2 Unlimited's worldwide mainstream success, the act scored a total of 16 chart hits, including \\"Get Ready for This\\", \\"Twilight Zone\\", \\"No Limit\\", and \\"Tribal Dance\\". They have sold 18 million records worldwide. Although they enjoyed less mainstream recognition in the United States, many of their songs have become popular themes at American sporting events, particularly in the NHL and the NBA. History =Formation= Jean- Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde met in their hometown of Antwerp, Belgium, and their first collaboration under the name of Bizz Nizz resulted in a single called \\"Don't Miss The Party Line\\" which entered the top 10 in the UK.. eNotes. The two then decided to continue to work together. Jean-Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde initially had created an instrumental track they called \\"Get Ready for This\\" in May 1991, and they decided that it needed some vocals.

It also peaked at No. 10 in the Netherlands and managed to climb to No. 2 in Australia and the UK. The single worked its way up to No. 38 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart only three years after its original release. A follow-up single, \\"Twilight Zone\\", followed in January 1992, and topped the chart in the Netherlands. It also charted well in numerous markets, reaching No. 2 in the UK. In the United States, it peaked at No. 49 on the Hot 100 (and No. 5 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart). To capitalize on this success, the album Get Ready! was released on 24 February 1992, featuring the first two singles and seven other new tracks, including two ballads. Two further singles were released from the album: \\"Workaholic\\" and \\"The Magic Friend\\". In the US, the album received a Gold certification for sales of 500,000 units in 1995. =No Limits! (1993‚Äì1994)= 2 Unlimited's lead single from their second album, \\"No Limit\\", was released in January 1993 and the repetitive nature of the song helped it become their most successful single ever, and by far the best remembered by the general public even now. The single topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and in the United Kingdom. In Germany, it was certified Platinum for sales of 500,000 units. The track received modest airplay on North American radio stations, reaching the top 25 in the US Dance charts. By 1996, worldwide sales had reached 2.3 million units. \\"Tribal Dance\\" was released as a single shortly before the album No Limits! hit the stores in May 1993. It entered the top 5 in Austria, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and in the UK. In Germany, \\"Tribal Dance\\" was certified Gold for sales of over 250,000 units. Three further singles were issued from the second album: \\"Faces\\", which was considerably different in pace to previous releases; \\"Maximum Overdrive\\"; and a re-recorded version of \\"Let the Beat Control Your Body\\". In France, the title was changed to \\"Let the Bass Control Your Body\\" to avoid any confusion with the slang word \\"bite\\" (meaning \\"penis\\"). 2 Unlimited's second album proved more successful than its predecessor, entering the top 5 album charts in Austria, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. In the UK, the album climbed all the way to the top of the album chart. By 1996, its total sales had reached 3 million units, including 592,000 units in the GSA region (Germany, Switzerland, Austria). Despite the phenomenal success the duo were enjoying in the UK, they were criticised heavily by the music industry, and the British press dubbed them \\"2 Untalented\\". =Real Things (1994‚Äì1995)= In May 1994, the duo's tenth single, \\"The Real Thing\\", was released, and it proved that their fans were still interested as they sent the single to No. 1 in the Netherlands, as well as the top 5 in Belgium, Germany, and Norway. While the duo's third album, Real Things, shot to No. 1 in the Netherlands and the UK, it also managed to land in the top 5 in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. The record was certified Gold in the UK for sales of over 100,000 units. The second single from Real Things, \\"No One\\", despite being a straightforward pop song, didn't prevent fans from sending it to No. 2 in the Netherlands on the sales chart. In March 1995, while the follow-up single, \\"Here I Go\\", was another top 5 hit in the Netherlands, the band's commercial success seemed to be declining elsewhere as the song made it in the top 20 only in Austria, Belgium, and Sweden. The fourth and final single was the ballad \\"Nothing Like the Rain\\", which was not quite as successful and did not receive a release in many territories, including the UK. =Hits Unlimited (1995‚Äì1996)= In October 1995, 2 Unlimited released their first compilation album, Hits Unlimited, prompting rumours that they were about to split up. The first single, \\"Do What's Good for Me\\", entered the top 5 in Finland, and the top 20 in the Netherlands and the UK. Despite their insistence that they were planning a world tour, in April 1996, shortly after the release of the single \\"Jump for Joy\\", both Slijngaard and Doth announced that 2 Unlimited was over. It later emerged that after having spent so much time together, they were no longer getting on as well as they once had, and there was disagreement about the future sound of band. They had asked for more creative input and they also felt that they were not getting a fair share of the huge amount of money being earned by the project. As no agreement was reached, they each went their separate ways before a final single, \\"Spread Your Love\\", was released in June 1996. =II (1998‚Äì1999)= As they still owned the rights to the name 2 Unlimited, De Coster and Wilde recruited two new (again Dutch) singers, Romy van Ooijen (b. 18 November 1971) and Marjon van Iwaarden (b. 18 June 1974), in order to capitalise on previous success. The first single released under the new lineup, \\"Wanna Get Up\\", did well in the Netherlands, reaching No. 10. A, remix by Sash!, for UK release, reached No. 38. The album II was released in April 1998. It was not as successful as previous studio albums, nor were the subsequent singles, \\"Edge of Heaven\\" and \\"Never Surrender\\". In 1999, both van Ooijen and van Iwaarden left 2 Unlimited. =Remixes (2000‚Äì2006)= In 2000, Byte Records released the remix singles \\"No Limit\\" and \\"Twilight Zone\\". A remix album was to be released that year, but some master tapes were stolen from Byte and taken to Russia, where they were released as a bootleg compilation. Also that year, 2 Unlimited made their first appearance on the Eurodance compilation Dancemania series, specifically its Speed sub-series, with their song \\"Twilight Zone\\", 'B4 Za Beat Mix'. In 2001, Byte finally released \\"Greatest Hits Remixes\\", featuring many new remixes. Some of the tracks from the stolen master tapes released in Russia were not included. The album was released solely in Japan. In 2002, Trance Remixes: Special Edition was released in Japan, featuring many more new remixes not included in the previous compilation. In the following years, many \\"best of\\" compilations have been released in various territories, often with new remixes. Most notably, ZYX Records released \\"No Limit 2.3\\" in 2003 and it was a moderate hit, reaching no. 41 in the German singles chart. It was promoted by a new duo, D√©bora Remagen and James Giscombe. They were being lined up as a 2 Unlimited \\"version 3\\". They still perform, mainly in Eastern Europe, but are not allowed to use their own voices. This is due to copyright issues. A new CD and DVD set containing all 2 Unlimited music videos, called The Complete History, was released in 2004, along with a single, \\"Tribal Dance 2.4\\" (originally released on 12\\" vinyl in November 2003 as \\"Tribal Dance 2.3\\"). 2005 saw the release of The Refreshed Album in Mexico, featuring stunning artwork, but the same remixes found on previous remix albums. In 2006, the DVD was re-packaged with a different CD, Greatest Remix Hits, and released in Australia. The following years would see this package re-released in Argentina, Denmark, Sweden, Asia, and South Africa. =Reunions (2009‚Äì2012)= Having both continued to perform their old hits separately in nightclubs and university student unions around the world, the original performers Slijngaard and Doth reunited on 11 April 2009, to perform together for the first time in 13 years at the \\"I Love the 90s\\" concert in Hasselt, Belgium.. Ilovethe90s.be. According to a radio interview with Slijngaard, Jean-Paul De Coster did not give permission for the duo to perform under the name 2 Unlimited; however, Phil Wilde attended the gig and provided help with preparing backing tracks. On 30 April 2009, Slijngaard and Doth performed five songs at the Radio 538 Queen's Day concert at Museumplein in Amsterdam. On 8 June, they were awarded \\"Most Popular Act of the 1990s\\", based on the number of weeks in the Dutch Top 40; on 25 September, they performed as a support act for Milk Inc. at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp. On 29 December 2009, it was announced that the duo would release a new single in 2010, called \\"In Da Name of Love\\", as Ray & Anita. It was released as a CD single in the Netherlands through Spinnin' Records on 22 January 2010. It reached No. 6 on the Dutch Top 40 sales chart. On 30 April 2010, a new single was presented during the Dutch Queen's Day, called \\"Still Unlimited\\". In July 2011, Ray & Anita invited fans to be part of the video for \\"Nothing 2 Lose\\" in Amsterdam. Fans applied via email and were selected randomly. The video with the fans was shot on 28 July. The single was released at the end of August 2011. The single is also the lead track for the soundtrack of the film Amsterdam Heavy. In the same month, Ray & Anita headlined the \\"I Love the 90's\\" stage at Tomorrowland in Belgium. =Comeback (2012‚Äì2016)= Ray & Anita live, 2016 On 11 July 2012, it was announced that Ray & Anita would be working again with Belgian producer De Coster under the name 2 Unlimited. On 30 March 2013, Slijngaard and Doth performed their first full concert as 2 Unlimited with their band in Belgium at Antwerps Sportpaleis. The duo released a remixed version of their very first single, \\"Get Ready for This\\", on 28 October 2013. The song was remixed by DJ Steve Aoki and was included on their Greatest Hits album. In 2014, 2 Unlimited gave concerts at ten festivals that together made up Acceleration 2014, which combined top class car and bike racing with music and entertainment. On 20 April 2016, 2 Unlimited announced that Anita Doth would be leaving the band at the end of 2016 to embark on a solo career. Doth was to be replaced by another singer, whose identity was not revealed right away. =Introduction of Kim (2016‚Äìpresent)= On 13 August 2016, Kim Vergouwen was revealed as Anita's replacement to the public via Ray Slijngaard's Facebook page. On 9 August 2020, 2 Unlimited performed at the third annual Dance Music Festival in Kielce, Poland. Discography * Get Ready! (1992) * No Limits!

Early life and education Jerry Sanders III grew up in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, raised by his paternal grandparents. He was once attacked and beaten by a street gang leaving him so covered in blood that a priest was called to administer the last rites. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign on an academic scholarship from the Pullman railroad car company. He graduated with his bachelor's degree in engineering in 1958. After graduation, Sanders worked for the Douglas Aircraft Company. He subsequenly moved to Motorola, then to Fairchild Semiconductor. Business career In 1968 Sherman Fairchild brought a new management team into Fairchild Semiconductor, led by C. Lester Hogan, then vice president of Motorola Semiconductor. The staff from Motorola, also known as \\"Hogan's Heroes\\", were conservative and hence immediately clashed with Sanders' boisterous style. In 1969 a group of Fairchild engineers decided to start a new company, which became Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). They asked Jerry Sanders to join them, and he said he would, provided he became the president of the company. Although it caused some dissension within the group, they agreed, and the company was founded with Sanders as President. Every employee at the company got stock options, an innovation at the time. Sanders gave the company a strong sales and marketing orientation, so that it was successful even though it was often behind its competitors in technology and manufacturing. He shared the success of the company with the employees, usually coincident with sales- oriented growth targets. He steered the company through hard times as well. In 1974, a particularly bad recession almost broke the company. Through many difficult recessions he refused to lay off employees, a reaction to the rampant layoffs that had occurred at Fairchild earlier. Instead of reducing employees, he asked them to work Saturdays to get more done and get new products out sooner. There were also good times for the company. Sanders gave each one of his employees $100 as they walked out of the door during AMD's first $1M quarter. AMD was also the first US company to implement a cash profit-sharing employee compensation program, where employees would regularly get profit checks of $1,000 or more. In 1982, he was responsible for a licensing deal with Intel that made AMD a second source to IBM for the Intel Microprocessor series, a deal that eventually made the company the only real competitor to Intel. In 2000, Sanders recruited H√©ctor Ruiz, at the time the president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, to serve as AMD's president and chief operating officer, and to become heir apparent to lead the company upon Sanders' retirement. He stayed with the company as chairman after Ruiz succeeded him as CEO in 2002. His maxim was \\"People first, products and profit will follow!\\" This was given as a printout for each AMD worker who started a job at AMD in Dresden until Sanders's retirement. Personal life Sanders has three children from his first marriage and one from his second.

Food processing includes many forms of processing foods, from grinding grain to make raw flour to home cooking to complex industrial methods used to make convenience foods. Primary food processing is necessary to make most foods edible, and secondary food processing turns the ingredients into familiar foods, such as bread. Tertiary food processing has been criticized for promoting overnutrition and obesity, containing too much sugar and salt, too little fiber, and otherwise being unhealthful in respect to dietary needs of humans and farm animals. Process = Primary food processing = These whole, dried bananas in Thailand are an example of primary food processing. Primary food processing turns agricultural products, such as raw wheat kernels or livestock, into something that can eventually be eaten. This category includes ingredients that are produced by ancient processes such as drying, threshing, winnowing and milling grain, shelling nuts, and butchering animals for meat. It also includes deboning and cutting meat, freezing and smoking fish and meat, extracting and filtering oils, canning food, preserving food through food irradiation, and candling eggs, as well as homogenizing and pasteurizing milk. Contamination and spoilage problems in primary food processing can lead to significant public health threats, as the resulting foods are used so widely. However, many forms of processing contribute to improved food safety and longer shelf life before the food spoils. Commercial food processing uses control systems such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to reduce the risk of harm. = Secondary food processing = Baking bread is an example of secondary food processing. Secondary food processing is the everyday process of creating food from ingredients that are ready to use. Baking bread, regardless of whether it is made at home, in a small bakery, or in a large factory, is an example of secondary food processing. Fermenting fish and making wine, beer, and other alcoholic products are traditional forms of secondary food processing. Sausages are a common form of secondary processed meat, formed by comminution (grinding) of meat that has already undergone primary processing. Most of the secondary food processing methods known to human kind are commonly described as cooking methods. = Tertiary food processing = Tertiary food processing is the commercial production of what is commonly called processed food. These are ready-to-eat or heat-and-serve foods, such as TV dinners and re-heated airline meals. History Food processing dates back to the prehistoric ages when crude processing incorporated fermenting, sun drying, preserving with salt, and various types of cooking (such as roasting, smoking, steaming, and oven baking), Such basic food processing involved chemical enzymatic changes to the basic structure of food in its natural form, as well served to build a barrier against surface microbial activity that caused rapid decay. Salt-preservation was especially common for foods that constituted warrior and sailors' diets until the introduction of canning methods. Evidence for the existence of these methods can be found in the writings of the ancient Greek, Chaldean, Egyptian and Roman civilizations as well as archaeological evidence from Europe, North and South America and Asia. These tried and tested processing techniques remained essentially the same until the advent of the industrial revolution. Examples of ready-meals also date back to before the preindustrial revolution, and include dishes such as Cornish pasty and Haggis. Both during ancient times and today in modern society these are considered processed foods. egg-processing plant in Wakefield, Nebraskaalt=left Modern food processing technology developed in the 19th and 20th centuries was developed in a large part to serve military needs. In 1809 Nicolas Appert invented a hermetic bottling technique that would preserve food for French troops which ultimately contributed to the development of tinning, and subsequently canning by Peter Durand in 1810. Although initially expensive and somewhat hazardous due to the lead used in cans, canned goods would later become a staple around the world. Pasteurization, discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1864, improved the quality and safety of preserved foods and introduced the wine, beer, and milk preservation. split-pea soup that has become traditional In the 20th century, World War II, the space race and the rising consumer society in developed countries contributed to the growth of food processing with such advances as spray drying, evaporation, juice concentrates, freeze drying and the introduction of artificial sweeteners, colouring agents, and such preservatives as sodium benzoate. In the late 20th century, products such as dried instant soups, reconstituted fruits and juices, and self cooking meals such as MRE food ration were developed. By the 20th century, automatic appliances like microwave oven, blender, and rotimatic paved way for convenience cooking. In western Europe and North America, the second half of the 20th century witnessed a rise in the pursuit of convenience. Food processing companies marketed their products especially towards middle-class working wives and mothers. Frozen foods (often credited to Clarence Birdseye) found their success in sales of juice concentrates and \\"TV dinners\\".Levenstein, H: \\"Paradox of Plenty\\", pages 106-107. University of California Press, 2003 Processors utilised the perceived value of time to appeal to the postwar population, and this same appeal contributes to the success of convenience foods today. Benefits and drawbacks =Benefits= Processed seafood ‚Äì fish, squid, prawn balls and simulated crab sticks (surimi) Benefits of food processing include toxin removal, preservation, easing marketing and distribution tasks, and increasing food consistency. In addition, it increases yearly availability of many foods, enables transportation of delicate perishable foods across long distances and makes many kinds of foods safe to eat by de-activating spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms. Modern supermarkets would not exist without modern food processing techniques, and long voyages would not be possible. Processed foods are usually less susceptible to early spoilage than fresh foods and are better suited for long-distance transportation from the source to the consumer. When they were first introduced, some processed foods helped to alleviate food shortages and improved the overall nutrition of populations as it made many new foods available to the masses. Processing can also reduce the incidence of food-borne disease. Fresh materials, such as fresh produce and raw meats, are more likely to harbour pathogenic micro-organisms (e.g. Salmonella) capable of causing serious illnesses. The extremely varied modern diet is only truly possible on a wide scale because of food processing. Transportation of more exotic foods, as well as the elimination of much hard labor gives the modern eater easy access to a wide variety of food unimaginable to their ancestors. The act of processing can often improve the taste of food significantly. Mass production of food is much cheaper overall than individual production of meals from raw ingredients. Therefore, a large profit potential exists for the manufacturers and suppliers of processed food products. Individuals may see a benefit in convenience, but rarely see any direct financial cost benefit in using processed food as compared to home preparation. Processed food freed people from the large amount of time involved in preparing and cooking \\"natural\\" unprocessed foods. The increase in free time allows people much more choice in life style than previously allowed. In many families the adults are working away from home and therefore there is little time for the preparation of food based on fresh ingredients. The food industry offers products that fulfill many different needs: e.g. fully prepared ready meals that can be heated up in the microwave oven within a few minutes. Modern food processing also improves the quality of life for people with allergies, diabetics, and other people who cannot consume some common food elements. Food processing can also add extra nutrients such as vitamins. =Drawbacks= Meat packages in a Roman supermarket Processing of food can decrease its nutritional density. The amount of nutrients lost depends on the food and processing method. For example, heat destroys vitamin C. Therefore, canned fruits possess less vitamin C than their fresh alternatives. The USDA conducted a study of nutrient retention in 2004, creating a table of foods, levels of preparation, and nutrition. New research highlighting the importance to human health of a rich microbial environment in the intestine indicates that abundant food processing (not fermentation of foods) endangers that environment. Using some food additives represents another safety concern. The health risks of any given additive vary greatly from person to person; for example using sugar as an additive endangers diabetics. In the European Union, only European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved food additives (e.g., sweeteners, preservatives, stabilizers) are permitted at specified levels for use in food products. Approved additives receive an E number (E for Europe), simplifying communication about food additives included in the ingredients' list for all the different languages spoken in the EU. As effects of chemical additives are learned, changes to laws and regulatory practices are made to make such processed foods more safe. Food processing is typically a mechanical process that utilizes extrusion, large mixing, grinding, chopping and emulsifying equipment in the production process. These processes introduce a number of contamination risks. Such contaminants are left over material from a previous operation, animal or human bodily fluids, microorganisms, nonmetallic and metallic fragments. Further processing of these contaminants will result in downstream equipment failure and the risk of ingestion by the consumer. Example: A mixing bowl or grinder is used over time, metal parts in contact with food will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants. Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure and the risk of ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize industrial metal detectors to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health. Food processing does have some benefits, such as making food last longer and making products more convenient. However, heavily processed foods also have drawbacks. Whole foods and those that are only minimally processed, like frozen vegetables without any sauce, tend to be more healthy. An unhealthy diet high in fat, added sugar and salt, such as one containing much highly processed food, can increase the risk for cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to the World Health Organization.  Added sodium  One of the main sources for sodium in the diet is processed foods. Sodium is added to prevent spoilage, add flavor and improve the texture of these foods. Americans consume an average of 3,436 milligrams of sodium per day, which is higher than the recommended limit of 2,300 milligrams per day for healthy people, and more than twice the limit of 1,500 milligrams per day for those at increased risk for heart disease.  Added sugars  While you don't need to limit the sugars found naturally in whole, unprocessed foods like fresh fruit, eating too much added sugar found in many processed foods can increase your risk for heart disease, obesity, cavities and Type 2 diabetes. The American Heart Association recommends women limit added sugars to no more than 100 calories, or 25 grams, and men limit added sugars to no more than 155 calories, or about 38.75 grams, per day. Currently, Americans consume an average of 355 calories from added sugars each day.  Nutrient losses  Processing foods often involves nutrient losses, which can make it harder to meet your needs if these nutrients aren't added back through fortification or enrichment. For example, using high heat during processing can cause vitamin C losses. Another example is refined grains, which have less fiber, vitamins and minerals than whole grains. Eating refined grains, such as those found in many processed foods, instead of whole grains may increase your risk for high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, according to a study published in \\"The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\\" in December 2007.  Trans fats  Foods that have undergone processing, including some commercial baked goods, desserts, margarine, frozen pizza, microwave popcorn and coffee creamers, sometimes contain trans fats. This is the most unhealthy type of fat, and may increase your risk for high cholesterol, heart disease and stroke. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends keeping your trans fat intake as low as possible.  Other potential disadvantages  Processed foods may actually take less energy to digest than whole foods, according to a study published in \\"Food & Nutrition Research\\" in 2010, meaning you retain more of the calories they contain. Processed foods also tend to be more allergenic than whole foods, according to a June 2004 \\"Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology\\" article. Although the preservatives and other food additives used in many processed foods are generally recognized as safe, a few may cause problems for some individuals, including sulfites, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors and flavors, sodium nitrate, BHA and BHT, olestra, caffeine and monosodium glutamate.

It used to concentrate on classical music and jazz. In 2007 and 2008, the network transitioned towards a new \\"adult music\\" format with a variety of genres, with the classical genre generally restricted to midday hours. In 2009, Radio 2 averaged 2.1 million listeners weekly, and it was the second largest radio network in Canada.\\"Millions of people tune into CBC Radio\\" Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. August 2010. History The CBC's FM network was launched in 1946, but was strictly a simulcast of the AM radio network until 1960. In that year, distinct programming on the FM network began. It was briefly discontinued in 1962, but resumed again in 1964. On November 3, 1975, the FM network was renamed CBC Stereo, to distinguish it from the AM network, known as CBC Radio. In the early 1990s, the CBC began offering selected programs on the Internet, most notably CBC Stereo's RealTime.\\"CBC radio networks going live on Internet\\". Kingston Whig-Standard, September 26, 1996. In September 1996, the corporation formally launched live audio streaming of both CBC Radio and CBC Stereo. Since the 1980s, many of the AM CBC Radio stations moved to FM due to the limitations of AM broadcasting, so in 1997 the CBC renamed the networks CBC Radio One and CBC Radio Two. As of 2018, there are a number of CBC Radio One low-power transmitters with only a few high-powered ones left still operating on the AM band in some areas across Canada. For much of its history, its programming focused on arts and culture, and primarily consisted of programs devoted to opera, classical music, jazz and theatre. Some programming devoted to Canadian pop and indie rock music was also aired, via the Saturday night CBC Radio 3 simulcast and predecessors such as RadioSonic, Night Lines, and the late-night programme Brave New Waves. = 2007 format change= In 2006, speculation arose that Radio Two programming would undergo a format and name change, similar to that which its French counterpart Espace musique undertook in 2004, although no plans were announced until January 2007.CBC Arts, \\"CBC Radio to broaden Radio Two, add arts magazine\\"., January 17, 2007. These changes, which took effect March 19, resulted in a tighter focus on music ‚Äì still primarily classical but also including jazz, world music, and live music of all types. The length and frequency of newscasts, which had essentially duplicated those heard on Radio One, was reduced dramatically. The 2007 revamp also resulted in a subtle name change from Radio Two to Radio 2. In March 2008, CBC announced plans to complete the transformation of Radio 2, significantly altering its daytime programming lineup.CBC Radio Two to revamp daytime programming, CBC news article These plans resulted in the \\"New Radio 2\\", starting September 2, 2008. In essence, the morning and afternoon drive programs, which had focused almost exclusively on classical music, were replaced with new shows featuring a wider range of genres. The goal, according to the CBC, was to increase exposure of musicians and genres, other than classical and jazz, which received little airtime on private radio. Concomitantly, four web radio streams ‚Äì all-classical, jazz, singer-songwriter, and \\"Canadian composer\\" ‚Äì were introduced. On June 10, the CBC announced that hosts associated with the new programming would include Julie Nesrallah, Molly Johnson and Rich Terfry.  Reception  Logo as CBC Radio 2 (2007‚Äì2016) There was a vocal, negative response to these changes from a variety of sources connected with the classical community, ranging from Facebook to blogs to newspaper columnists. Russell Smith, \\"No classical? Then kill Radio 2 and get it over with\\" . The Globe and Mail, March 13, 2008. National protests were also held at CBC facilities across the country. However, the move drew support from other corners of the cultural community, noting in many cases the low ratings of the existing service. Among the supporters were several critically acclaimed artists who would benefit from the changes.A CBC without an orchestra can be sound step for Radio 2, John Terauds, Toronto Star, March 29, 2008John Doyle, \\"Note to classical music fans: Get over yourselves\\".

Critics also noted that classical music programming would be reduced from 12 hours per day to only 5 hours during daytime working office hours. As of November 25, 2009, classical content remained at 5 hours per day on weekdays, but was not exclusively on Tempo. The 2 to 3 pm (local time) hour is part of Shift, hosted by Tom Allen, which plays some classical music near the beginning of the program before transitioning to the adult-alternative style found on Drive. CBC cited the need for Tempo's host to spend more time working on her musical career as one reason behind this change. On May 2, 2008, the president of the CBC and the director of programming attended a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Canadian Heritage. There appeared to be opposition to the movement away from classical music on Radio 2 from MPs of all three main parties represented on the committee. Committee members Bill Siksay and Ed Fast were particularly opposed to the programming changes. The committee voted unanimously to hold further hearings specifically on the CBC Radio 2 changes in September 2008. Despite the controversy, the format change was successful for the network, which maintained a consistent overall audience while lowering the average age of its listenership from 65 to 52 in January 2010.\\"Genre change a winning switch for CBC Radio 2\\". Edmonton Journal, January 17, 2010. = 2010s = On February 6, 2018, the CBC announced that Radio 2 would be rebranded as CBC Music, aligning with the branding of the corporation's music website and digital audio service (discussed below).\\"Radio 2 is changing names. What you need to know.\\". Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, February 6, 2018. = 2020s = During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the service temporarily shifted to a playlist of exclusively Canadian music, to help support Canadian musicians impacted by the cancellations of their concert tours. Distribution The network is not as widely available across Canada as Radio One. While Radio One is available in most communities across Canada regardless of size, CBC Music for the most part is available only in larger cities. Only 14 transmitters across Canada are licensed as originating stations within the network, compared to over 30 for Radio One, although some additional cities are also served by rebroadcasters of one of the originating stations. The service is provided in some form to virtually all of Canada's major cities and all provincial capitals. CBC Music also has a more consistent national schedule than Radio One; currently the originating stations produce only limited regional programming, such as weather updates. In the past these stations would also air local news summaries or a daily calendar of local arts and culture events; this was dropped in 2007. CBH-FM in Halifax produces an additional regional music program for the Atlantic Canada region, due to a scheduling hole caused by the time zone difference. In some smaller communities, especially in rural northern British Columbia, community groups have been licensed to rebroadcast a CBC Music station on a local low-power radio transmitter. These transmitters are owned by the community group rather than the network, and do not originate any programming at all. On satellite, the network's programming can also be heard on Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct. Unlike Radio One and Radio 3, CBC Music is not carried by SiriusXM Satellite Radio; the CRTC requires that a \\"Canadian\\" channel (for the purposes of Sirius Canada, which carried CBC programming prior to its merger with XM Radio Canada) must carry 85% Canadian musical content, a requirement that has not been imposed on (or met by) the terrestrial network. Even so, a handful of programs that did meet this criterion, such as Deep Roots, have aired on Radio One's Sirius XM feed (channel 169); for a period in the mid-2010s, CBC Music also programmed a separate service for SiriusXM, CBC Music Sonica, which was devoted exclusively to Canadian music. This channel was later discontinued. CBC Music is also available via the internet in webradio and podcast form. Between October 2013 and September 2016, access to the network's domestic internet streams was blocked for listeners outside Canada. The CBC stated that they were not allowed to broadcast advertising outside of Canada. Two ad-free streams ‚Äì Eastern International and Pacific International ‚Äì were made available for international users. On these streams, commercials were replaced with CBC promos and other filler content. After the CRTC ordered the CBC to stop broadcasting ads on the network in 2016, international users have regained access to all five domestic streams. =Stations= Only stations which are licensed as \\"originating stations\\" within the network are listed here. Some stations also have rebroadcasters in smaller outlying markets; these are listed in each station's separate article. =Former affiliates= * Kentville, Nova Scotia - CKWM-FM - disaffiliated in 1988. * London, Ontario - CFPL-FM - disaffiliated in 1972. * Red Deer, Alberta - CKRD-FM - disaffiliated in 1981. =Website= On February 13, 2012, CBC launched CBC Music as an internet radio platform, featuring the existing CBC Radio services and 47 dedicated channels devoted to particular genres of music. The service is distributed via the CBC Music website, and accompanying mobile apps, initially launched for Android, iOS, and BlackBerry OS.\\"CBC launches free digital music service\\". Ottawa Citizen, February 13, 2012. Some of the genre webstreams were already provided by Radio 2 or Radio 3, while others were new offerings at the 2012 launch; over time, however, the names and formats of the genre streams have evolved significantly, with some of the original streams having been discontinued in favour of new ones, reformatted to alter their genre focus, or renamed to align their branding with the network's programming. The service was launched shortly after the CBC reached a music licensing deal with the Audio-Video Licensing Agency in January 2012. The site was one of the first large-scale ventures into online broadcasting to be available in Canada since the launch of Iceberg Radio in 1997; at the time of CBC Music's launch, popular international ventures such as Pandora or Spotify remained unavailable to Canadian consumers. A similar site, IciMusique.ca (formerly espace.mu, in reference to former radio branding Espace Musique), is also offered by CBC Music's French-language counterpart Ici Musique. Shortly after the service's launch, Stingray Digital filed a complaint with the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, alleging that the CBC's access to government funding gave it an unfair competitive advantage over private for- profit services. Noting that the CBC pays the same copyright royalties to SOCAN as the competing services and that it places a much greater emphasis on Canadian content than the commercial services, the CRTC dismissed the complaint in August 2012. In December 2013, the site also launched the first issue of CBC Music Magazine, an e-magazine distributed in both iOS and Android formats.\\"Introducing the CBC Music Magazine\\". CBC Music, December 23, 2013. The magazine is no longer published. With the rebranding of Radio 2 in 2018, the website is considered to be part of the radio network's operations rather than a distinct division of the CBC, although the individual genre streams and Radio 3 are still provided. The CBC Music streaming platform was replaced by CBC Listen in 2019. Programming Although most programming on CBC Music is exclusive to the network, some specialty programs, including The Vinyl Cafe (until 2015), Vinyl Tap, C'est formidable!, Backstage with Ben Heppner and Canada Live, also air on Radio One in different time slots. Until 2007, Radio 2 simulcast the majority of Radio One's newscasts, including The World at Six and World Report, resulting in several lengthy breaks from music throughout the day. This ended in March 2007, when Radio 2 began to carry a separate news service, with news updates of 90 seconds in length a handful of times each day. The length was soon changed to 4 ¬Ω minutes, the usual length of the CBC's non-major newscasts, with the frequency increased slightly. However, newscasts on Radio 2 remain distinct from those on Radio One. During the 2005 Canadian Media Guild lockout, the normal schedule was temporarily replaced by continuous music from Galaxie (then owned by the CBC), except for short news updates at the top of each hour from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time. After the 2012 federal budget, the CBC applied to the CRTC for permission to introduce commercial advertisements on CBC Radio 2 and sister network Espace Musique.\\"Cuts will mean a 'very different public broadcaster': CBC boss\\". Postmedia News, April 5, 2012. In October 2013, the network began broadcasting a limited amount of advertising, up to four minutes an hour,\\"CBC wades gently into on-air commercials\\". Toronto Star, October 1, 2013. with a goal of broadcasting up to nine minutes per hour in 2016.\\"Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-263 and Broadcasting Orders CRTC 2013-264 and 2013-265\\". Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission, May 28, 2013. Ad-free streams of the Toronto and Vancouver feeds were introduced online for international listeners. On August 31, 2016, the CRTC denied CBC's request to continue airing commercial advertisements until August 31, 2018. Consequently, advertising ceased on September 1, 2016. CBC Music also produces the television series CBC Music Backstage Pass, featuring live performances by musicians, for CBC Television.\\"CBC music expands reach with festival at Echo Beach\\". Toronto Star, May 24, 2013. =Weekday programming= The network's weekday programming does not vary significantly from day to day; except in the 7‚Äì8 p.m. hour, when a different one-hour weekly program normally airs each day, the schedule is otherwise consistent from Mondays to Fridays. Mornings, hosted by Saroja Coelho, airs in the morning drive slot, and is followed at 9 a.m. by the classical music show Tempo, hosted by Julie Nesrallah. Shift, hosted by Tom Allen, airs in the early afternoons, followed by Drive, hosted by Rich Terfry. The 7‚Äì8 p.m. block includes Canada Live, a program that presents recordings of live concerts by Canadian musicians, on Mondays; Q the Music, a program which reairs live performances and interviews from the Radio One series Q, on Tuesdays; Reclaimed, hosted by Jarrett Martineau and devoted to indigenous music, on Wednesdays; CBC Music Top 20, a countdown show hosted by a variety of network personalities, on Thursdays; and Marvin's Room, hosted by Amanda Parris and devoted to rhythm and blues, on Fridays. Due to Radio One's preemption of Q from its regular morning time slot during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada in favour of an extended broadcast of the news program The Current, during that period the 7‚Äì8 p.m. block on CBC Music was also suspended to provide an extra daily airing of Q. Odario Williams hosts After Dark in the evenings, while Nightstream, a hostless stream of continuous music, airs overnights. At various times during the day, Grant Lawrence of CBC Radio 3 is also heard voicing short segments presenting music news, such as a short profile of a musician who has just released a new album. =Weekend programming= On Saturday and Sunday, Mornings airs with weekend host Angeline Tetteh-Wayoe; however, for the remainder of the day the network airs a variety of specialty programs, mainly devoted to particular genres of music, rather than replicating the weekday schedule. Saturday programming includes My Playlist, Centre Stage with Katherine Duncan, Saturday Afternoon at the Opera, Backstage with Ben Heppner, Saturday Night Blues with Holger Petersen and Saturday Night Jazz with Laila Biali. Sunday programming includes Choral Concert with Katherine Duncan, In Concert with Paolo Pietropaolo, Inside the Music, C'est formidable! with Florence K, Randy Bachman's Vinyl Tap and The Strombo Show with George Stroumboulopoulos. On both Saturdays and Sundays, Nightstream again airs after midnight. =Past programming= *Music and Company with Tom Allen ‚Äì classical music; weekday mornings *Two New Hours with Larry Lake ‚Äì contemporary classical and new music *Here's to You with Catherine Belyea (previously Shelley Solmes) ‚Äì by-request classical music; weekday mid-mornings, Based on the earlier program Take Five, hosted by Solmes and earlier by Shelagh Rogers *Off the Record with Bob Kerr ‚Äì various classical music; weekday afternoons *Studio Sparks with Eric Friesen ‚Äì classical, with some jazz and world music; early weekday afternoons *DiscDrive with Jurgen Gothe ‚Äì classical, with some jazz and bluegrass; weekday afternoon drive (1985‚Äì2008) *In Performance with Andrew Craig (previously Eric Friesen) ‚Äì live-to-tape classical performances; weeknights *After Hours with Andy Sheppard (previously Ross Porter) ‚Äì jazz; weeknights *Brave New Waves (1984‚Äì2007) ‚Äì alternative music, weekdays at midnight.

The topic of Searchlight was different each year, with contests focusing on such themes as Canada's best live music club, best music festival and best music website. Following the launch of CBC Music, Searchlight was relaunched as a platform-wide contest to determine Canada's best unsigned musical artist. Incorporating participation from both CBC Music and CBC Radio One,\\"Searchlight: The hunt for Canada's best artist starts today\\". CBC News, March 16, 2015. the process begins with a series of local competitions produced by Radio One's local afternoon shows. Listener feedback and online voting determines the artists who advance to the next round, until the national stage of the competition begins on Q. When the list has been narrowed to ten artists, three established musicians step in as judges, who each pick their own favourite act. Those three artists and an audience selection as determined by online voting advance to the final round as the four finalists, following which the judges debate and discuss the choices before voting on the ultimate winner. In 2018, the process was revised, with the judges selecting five artists and a public vote selecting five artists, for a list of ten finalists rather than four. The winner of the competition wins $20,000 in musical gear from Yamaha Music, as well as a slot on the bill at the CBC Music Festival. =Winners and finalists= *2013 ‚Äì Sherman Downey and the Ambiguous Case,\\"Searchlight 2013 winner: Canada‚Äôs best new artist is...

He served as United States Attorney General in the cabinet of Grover Cleveland and Secretary of State under Cleveland and briefly under William McKinley. As attorney general, Olney used injunctions against striking workers in the Pullman strike, setting a precedent, and advised the use of federal troops, when legal means failed to control the strikers. As Secretary of State, he raised the status of America in the world by elevating U.S. diplomatic posts to the status of embassy.  Early life and education  Olney was born into a family of means in Oxford, Massachusetts. His father was Wilson Olney, a textiles manufacturer and banker.\\"Richard Olney Dies; Veteran Statesman\\" (PDF) The New York Times (April 10, 1917), page 13.

The family then moved back to Oxford and Olney attended school at the Leicester Academy in Leicester. He graduated with high honors as class orator from Brown University in 1856. He received a bachelor of laws degree from Harvard Law School in 1858. In 1859, he passed the bar and began practicing law in Boston, attaining a reputation as an authority on probate, trust and corporate law.  Early career  Olney was elected a selectman in West Roxbury, Massachusetts and served one term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1874. He declined to run again, preferring to return to his law practice.

He replied in an 1892 letter, \\"The Commission... is, or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of the railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. Further, the older such a commission gets to be, the more inclined it will be found to take the business and railroad view of things...

Attorney General  In March 1893, Olney became U.S. Attorney General and used the law to thwart strikes, which he considered an illegitimate tactic contrary to law. Olney argued that the government must prevent interference with its mails and with the general railway transportation between the states. = Pullman strike = During the 1894 Pullman strike, Olney instructed district attorneys to secure from the Federal Courts writs of injunction against striking railroad employees.\\"Orders Sent to Indict Debs\\" (PDF) The New York Times (July 5, 1894).

When the legal measures failed, he advised President Cleveland to send federal troops to Chicago to quell the strike, over the objections of the Governor of Illinois.  Secretary of State  Upon the death of Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham, Cleveland named Olney to the position on June 10, 1895. Olney quickly elevated US foreign diplomatic posts to the title of embassy, officially raising the status of the United States to one of the world's greater nations. (Until then, the United States had had only Legations, which diplomatic protocol dictated be treated as inferior to embassies.) Olney took a prominent role in the boundary dispute between the British and Venezuelan governments. In his correspondence with Lord Salisbury, he gave an extended interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that went considerably beyond previous statements on the subject, now known as the Olney interpretation.  Later years  Olney returned to the practice of the law in 1897, at the expiration of Cleveland's term.

The film stars Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie. It is an example of \\"Ottensian\\" (pre-WWII) dieselpunk. Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser with a bluescreen set up in his living room and using a Macintosh IIci. He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so impressed that Avnet spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was interested, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal (a worldwide distribution deal would later happen with Paramount Pictures). Almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators, and compositors created the multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live- action footage, while the entire film was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as CG animatics. Ten months prior to shooting the live action scenes, Conran first shot them with stand-ins in Los Angeles, then converted that footage to animatics so the actors could accurately envision the film. Despite being a box office bomb, generating only $58 million at the box office on a $70 million budget, Sky Captain received largely positive reviews, particularly for the style of filming that was used; some criticism was directed at the plot and characterization. The film has since gained a following and is regarded as a cult classic. It was one of the first major films, along with Casshern (2004) Immortal and Sin City (2005), to be shot entirely on a \\"digital backlot\\", blending actors with CG surroundings. Plot In a technologically-advanced 1939, the zeppelin Hindenburg III moors itself atop the Empire State Building. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished. Polly Perkins, a reporter for The Chronicle, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for \\"Sky Captain\\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero, Perkins' former lover, and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and convinces Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex tracks the origin of the signal controlling the drones and notes it on a map before his capture. Joe and Polly find Dex's map and fly to Nepal and then Tibet, where they discover an abandoned mining outpost and meet Joe's old friend Kaji. Two guides working for Totenkopf force Polly to turn over the vials, locking the duo in a room full of dynamite. Joe and Polly manage to escape just before the room explodes, knocking them unconscious and destroying most of Polly's film. They wake up together in the mythical Shangri-La. The Tibetan-speaking monks there tell of Totenkopf's enslavement of their people, forcing them to work in the uranium mines. Most were killed by the radiation, but the final survivor provides a clue to where Dr. Totenkopf is hiding. With insufficient fuel to make it there, they run into a Royal Navy flying aircraft carrier commanded by another of Joe's former flames, Commander Franky Cook. Franky leads the attack on Totenkopf's island lair while Joe and Polly enter through an underwater inlet. Joe and Polly find themselves on an island with dinosaur-like creatures, which Polly hesitates to photograph as she has only two shots left. They find a secret subterranean facility in a mountain, where robots are loading animals, as well as the mysterious vials, onto a large \\"Noah's Ark\\" rocket. Joe and Polly are detected but Dex, piloting a flying barge, arrives with three of the missing scientists. One of whom explains that Totenkopf has given up on humanity and seeks to start the world over again: the \\"World of Tomorrow\\". The vials are genetic material for a new Adam and Eve. Sky Captain says they should just let Totenkopf go but Dex states that they can't; if the rocket reaches space, the afterburners will ignite the atmosphere and kill everyone on Earth. As the group attempts to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted by the defense system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking of his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the lair's defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse inside with a scrap of paper clutched in his hand: \\"forgive me\\". He had died 20 years prior, but his machines continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100 km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same assassin robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. Joe and Polly use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket explodes. Joe and Polly watch the animal pods splash down around their escape pod, while Commander Cook leads a group of flying aircraft carriers towards them. Polly then uses the last shot on her camera to take a picture of Joe rather than the animal pods. Joe grins and says: \\"Polly--lens cap.\\" Cast * Jude Law as Joseph Sullivan/Sky Captain: He commands a private air force known as the Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, \\"All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look.\\" Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law said \\"What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [relationship]. I always like to call it The African Queen meets Buck Rogers.\\" Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had \\"worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star.\\" The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year. * Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, reporter for the New York Chronicle. Law believed so much in Conran's movie that he became one of the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember \\"any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board.\\" Paltrow said in an interview, \\"I thought that this is the time to do a movie like this where it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie.\\" * Angelina Jolie as Commander Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook: She commands a Royal Navy flying aircraft carrier. Jolie had just arrived from the set of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider ‚Äì The Cradle of Life (2003) and agreed to work on the movie for three days. Despite her small role, she reportedly had conducted hours of interviews with fighter pilots in order to absorb their jargon and get a feel for the role. * Giovanni Ribisi as Dex, ace mechanic of the Flying Legion. Ribisi met with Avnet and, initially, was not sure that he wanted to do the movie but after seeing the teaser trailer, he signed on without hesitation. * Michael Gambon as Editor Paley, editor of the Chronicle newspaper in New York * Omid Djalili as Kaji, former comrade-in-arms from the Flying Legion * Bai Ling as The Mysterious Woman, Totenkopf's henchwoman, who is also a gynoid. * Julian Curry as Dr. Jorge Vargas, a missing scientist * Trevor Baxter as Dr. Walter Jennings, a missing scientist * Peter Law as Dr. Kessler, a missing scientist * Laurence Olivier as Dr. Totenkopf, the mysterious mad scientist and supervillain; Olivier had been deceased for nearly 13 years at the time of filming, and was depicted in the film via computer manipulation of video and audio from when he was a young actor. * Khan Bonfils as one of the double-agent guides working for Totenkopf (identified in the credits as \\"Creepy\\"; the other guide is \\"Scary\\") Peter Law, who plays Dr. Kessler, is the father of Jude Law. The novelization written by Kevin J. Anderson gives the full names for Dex and Editor Paley as Dexter Dearborn and Morris Paley. Development Kerry Conran grew up on films and comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were encouraged by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he realized that it was possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself. =Influences= Conran was influenced by the designs of Norman Bel Geddes, an industrial designer who did work for the 1933 Chicago World's Fair and designed exhibits for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Geddes also designed an Airliner Number 4 that was to fly from Chicago to London. Another key influence was Hugh Ferriss, one of the designers for the 1939 New York World's Fair who designed bridges and huge housing complexes. He was an American delineator (one who creates perspective drawings of buildings) and architect. In 1922, skyscraper architect Harvey Wiley Corbett commissioned Ferriss to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of the 1916 Zoning Resolution. These four drawings would later be used in his 1929 book The Metropolis of Tomorrow (Dover Publications, 2005, ). Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair itself and its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: \\"... obviously the title refers to the World Expo and the spirit of that was looking at the future with a sense of optimism and a sense of the whimsical, you know, something that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... I think what this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today.\\" Conran acknowledged his debt to German Expressionism, which was particularly evident in the opening scenes in New York City: \\"Early German cinema was born of just a completely different aesthetic than what we see nowadays. One of the last things I watched before starting this project was the Dr. Mabuse series that Lang had done - terribly inspirational, the use of art and propaganda even.\\" Conran summed up what influenced him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: \\"We tried to approach it almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists trying to make a work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough.\\" Sky Captain has a number of commonalities with Hayao Miyazaki's anime movie Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986). The sky pirates' focus on primitive mechanics, large airships, and military cultures is similar. Both stories center on an evil madman controlling an island of high technology, and the search for that island. Laputa has the evil madman searching for the island, while Sky Captain has the island as the base of the madman from the beginning. Sky Captain is also different in its message, which is largely about the film genre, while Laputa has strong anti-war and anti- technology themes, found in most of Miyazaki's work. Additionally, both the Miyazaki film and Sky Captain pay homage to the 1941 Superman animated short The Mechanical Monsters. =Teaser trailer= In 1994, Conran set up a bluescreen in his living room and began assembling the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than \\"just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked.\\" Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie. =Pre-production= Avnet and Conran spent two years working on the screenplay, which included numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently with a lot of his own money. The producer realized that \\"the very thing that made this film potentially so exciting for me, and I think for an audience, was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, which would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio.\\" Avnet went to Aurelio De Laurentiis and convinced him to finance the film without a distribution deal. Nine months before filming, Avnet had Conran meet the actors and begin rehearsals in an attempt to get the shy filmmaker out of his shell. Avnet set up a custom digital effects studio with a blue screen soundstage in an abandoned building in Van Nuys, California. A group of almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors created multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live action footage yet to be filmed. The entire movie was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics with all of the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery. Ten months before Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in animatics so that the actors had an idea of what the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage. =Principal photography and post-production= Conran and Avnet were able to cut costs considerably by shooting the entire movie in 26 days (not the usual three to four months that this kind of movie normally takes) on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 and working entirely on three blue screen soundstages in London, England with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because there was no time to shoot it on a blue screen soundstage. The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running Final Cut Pro that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, \\"I don't know how we would have made this movie. It's really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there.\\" After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in Los Angeles who added CG and sent it back. After filming ended, they put together a 24-minute presentation and took it to every studio in June 2003. There was a lot of interest and Avnet selected the studio that gave Conran the most creative control. They needed studio backing to finish the film's ambitious visuals. At one point, the producer remembers that Conran was \\"working 18 to 20 hours a day for a long period of time. It's 2,000 some odd CG shots done in one year, and we literally had to write code to figure out how to do this stuff!\\" Most of the post-production work was done on Mac workstations using After Effects for compositing and Final Cut Pro for editing (seven workstations were dedicated to visual effects and production editing). The distinctive look of the film was achieved by running footage through a diffusion filter and then tinting it in black and white before color was blended, balanced and added back in. Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989, posthumously appears as the villain and mad scientist Dr. Totenkopf. His likeness was produced using digitally manipulated archival BBC footage of the actor and thus adding one more film to his repertoire. A similar move was made two years later in Superman Returns (2006) with Marlon Brando. Avnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from the summer (it was supposed to open a week before Spider-Man 2 (2004)) to September, then courting the Internet press and finally making an appearance at the San Diego Comic Con with key cast members in an attempt to generate some advance buzz. Soundtrack Composer Edward Shearmur wrote the film's lavish orchestral score in the style of Hollywood's golden-age composers, and the film's end-title sequence featured a new recording of the Oscar-winning standard \\"Over the Rainbow\\" sung by American jazz singer Jane Monheit, which were all featured on Sony Classical's original motion picture soundtrack recording. La-La Land Records released a limited edition 2-disc set in 2017 with the complete score. =Sony Classical track listing= # \\"The World of Tomorrow\\" ‚Äì 1:07 # \\"The Zeppelin Arrives\\" ‚Äì 1:53 # \\"The Robot Army\\" ‚Äì 3:01 # \\"Calling Sky Captain\\" ‚Äì 3:26 # \\"Back at the Base\\" ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"The Flying Wings Attack\\" ‚Äì 6:31 # \\"An Aquatic Escape\\" ‚Äì 2:29 # \\"Flight to Nepal\\" ‚Äì 4:38 # \\"Treacherous Journey\\" ‚Äì 2:22 # \\"Dynamite\\" ‚Äì 2:26 # \\"Three in a Bed\\" ‚Äì 0:57 # \\"Finding Frankie\\" ‚Äì 5:02 # \\"Manta Squadron\\" ‚Äì 6:33 # \\"h-770-d\\" ‚Äì 1:14 # \\"Flying Lizard\\" ‚Äì 1:06 # \\"Totenkopf's Ark\\" ‚Äì 5:01 # \\"Back to Earth\\" ‚Äì 3:14 # \\"Over the Rainbow\\" ‚Äì 3:54 =La-La Land track listing= DISC 1 (unreleased tracks in bold, tracks with unreleased material in italics) # The World of Tomorrow 1:09 # The Zeppelin Arrives 1:53 # Telegram 1:36 # Meet Polly 1:33 # The Office 2:16 # The Robot Army 3:02 # Calling Sky Captain 3:23 # After Robots/Meet Dex 2:58 # Back at the Base 2:53 # Hanger-Car/Jennings Lab/Dr. Jennings Is Dead 6:05 # The Flying Wings Attack/Wiggly Robots 8:13 # An Aquatic Escape 2:32 # S.C.

However, the film only grossed $37.7 million in North America, below its estimated $70 million budget. It managed to gross $20.1 million in the rest of the world, making its final worldwide tally $57.9 million. The film is considered a box office flop. Kevin Conran disputed this budget figure in a 2015 interview. \\"I take great issue with that [budget figure] personally and I‚Äôd like someone to show me where all that money went,\\" says Kevin. \\"I don‚Äôt support those numbers and I never have. We walked into Jon Avnet‚Äôs office that first day and he said, 'What do you want for the production?' and we said $3 million. We could have done a version of this film for $3 million. It would have been black-and- white and sans name actors ... \\"But even still, this whole thing was going to be under $20 million. How it went from 20 to 70, you tell me.\\" =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is slim on plot and characterization, but the visuals more than make up for it\\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100 based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. The Canadian network Space awarded it the 2005 Spacey Award for Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Film. Roger Ebert was among those who strongly supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for \\"its heedless energy and joy, it reminded me of how I felt the first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way\\". The film is also one of few to be awarded five out of five stars by IGN FilmForce. In his review for the Chicago Reader, J.R. Jones wrote, \\"This debut feature by Kerry Conran is a triumph not only for its technical mastery but for its good taste\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"A‚àí\\" rating, saying, \\"The investment is optimistic and wise; Sky Captain is a gorgeous, funny, and welcome novelty\\". Other critics' enthusiasm was somewhat tempered. For instance, Stephen Holden of The New York Times lauded its visuals and its evocation of a bygone era but felt that \\"the monochromatic variations on sepia keep the actors and their adventures at a refined aesthetic distance ... At times the film is hard to see. And as the action accelerates, the wonder of its visual concept starts giving way to sci-fi clich√©s\\". USA Today said that the film was \\"all style over substance, a clever parlor trick but a dull movie\\". Stephen Hunter, of The Washington Post, called it \\"a $70 million novelty item\\". Homages Robot #5 terrorizes the city in The Mechanical Monsters (1941). First-time director Conran incorporated many references to classic genre films into his own movie: The army of giant robots seen in the film - both flying over the city and later various models in Sky Captain's massive warehouse, particularly one designated as number \\"5\\" - are a homage to the Paramount Pictures Superman cartoon The Mechanical Monsters (1941), produced by Fleischer Studios. When early in the film newspaper clippings from around the globe are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic silhouette of Godzilla is clearly visible. Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on the Empire State Building in the background. During the underwater dogfight sequence, a light momentarily displays the wreckage of a ship with the name Venture - the tramp steamer that sailed to Skull Island in the 1933 version of King Kong. In the same scene, what appears to be the wreckage of the RMS Titanic can be seen, as well an ancient underwater city which seems to be a nod to the legend of Atlantis. The villain's main logo bears striking similarities to the logo for Crimson Skies, a game universe that some critics noted bore stylistic and plot similarities to the film. =Pulp magazines and comic books= The Flying Legion is a homage to pulp magazine and comic book heroes such as G-8 and his Battle Aces, Captain Midnight, and the Blackhawk squadron. Also, production designer Kevin Conran, the brother of director Kerry Conran, based the design of the flying humanoid robots, in part, on the helmet worn by the DC Comics superhero Adam Strange and the flight controls for Commando Cody's rocket-pack.

Image of workers marching during the Lawrence textile strike.upright=1.2 \\"Bread and Roses\\" is a political slogan as well as the name of an associated poem and song. It originated from a speech given by American women's suffrage activist Helen Todd; a line in that speech about \\"bread for all, and roses too\\" inspired the title of the poem Bread and Roses by James Oppenheim. The poem was first published in The American Magazine in December 1911, with the attribution line \\"Bread for all, and Roses, too'‚Äîa slogan of the women in the West.\\" The poem has been translated into other languages and has been set to music by at least three composers. The phrase is commonly associated with the successful textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, between January and March 1912, now often referred to as the \\"Bread and Roses strike\\". The slogan pairing bread and roses, appealing for both fair wages and dignified conditions, found resonance as transcending \\"the sometimes tedious struggles for marginal economic advances\\" in the \\"light of labor struggles as based on striving for dignity and respect\\", as Robert J. S. Ross wrote in 2013. History = Women's suffrage = Helen Todd and her colleagues campaign for women's suffrage. Todd, as a factory inspector, discussed how the right to vote would gain for working women and society \\"bread and roses\\" ‚Äì that is a living wage and life's roses. The first mention of the phrase and its meaning appears in The American Magazine in September 1911. In an article by Helen Todd, she describes how a group of women from the Chicago Women's Club, after listening to advice from Senator Robert La Follette, decided to initiate an automobile campaign around the state of Illinois for the right of women to vote in June 1910. The women who made up the first automobile campaign were Catherine McCulloch, a lawyer and justice of the peace; Anna Blount, a physician and surgeon; Kate Hughes, a minister; Helen Todd, a state factory inspector; and Jennie Johnson, a singer. Each of the speakers was assigned a subject in which they were an expert. McCulloch gave a record of the votes of the representatives and senators to their home constituents. Blount's subject was taxation without representation as concerns women. Hughes gave her speech on the history of the women's suffrage movement. Johnson opened up the speeches with a set of suffrage songs which was intended to focus and quiet the audience for the subsequent speeches. Helen Todd, as a factory inspector, represented the working women and discussed the need for laws concerning wages, work conditions, and hours. It is in Helen Todd's speech on the condition of the working women that the phrase is first mentioned. A young hired girl expressed to Helen Todd, who was staying with the hired girl's family overnight during the campaign, what she had liked the most about the speeches the night before, it \\"was that about the women votin' so's everybody would have bread and flowers too.\\" Helen Todd then goes on to explain how the phrase \\"Bread for all, and Roses too\\" expresses the soul of the women's movement and explains the meaning of the phrase in her speech. = Women's Trade Union League = The Women's Trade Union League was central in promoting the upright Helen Todd, subsequently, became involved in the fall of 1910 with Chicago garment workers' strike, which was led by the Women's Trade Union League of Chicago. The Women's Trade Union League worked closely with the Chicago Women's Club in organizing the strike, picket lines, speeches, and worker relief activities. Helen Todd and the president of the Women's Trade Union League Margaret Robins made a number of speeches during the strike and manned with the thousands of striking garment workers the picket lines. During the strike, it was later reported that a sign was seen with the slogan \\"We want bread ‚Äì and roses, too\\". In 1911, Helen Todd went out to California to help lead the suffrage movement in the state and campaign in the state's fall election for proposition 4, which sought women's suffrage. The women's suffrage campaign proved successful, and the right for women to vote passed in the state in November 1911. During the California campaign, the suffragettes carried banners with several slogans; one was \\"Bread for all, and Roses, too!\\" ‚Äì the same phrase that Helen Todd used in her speech the previous summer. = Oppenheim's poem = The phrase was subsequently picked up by James Oppenheim and incorporated into his poem Bread and Roses, which was published in The American Magazine in December 1911, with the attribution line \\"Bread for all, and Roses, too' ‚Äì a slogan of the women in the West.\\" After the poems publication in 1911, the poem was published again in July 1912 in The Survey with the same attribution as in December 1911. It was published again on October 4, 1912 in The Public, a weekly led by Louis F. Post in Chicago, this time with the slogan being attributed to the \\"Chicago Women Trade Unionists\\". = Lawrence textile strike = right The first publication of Openheim's poem in book form was in the 1915 labor anthology, The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest by Upton Sinclair. This time the poem had the new attribution and rephrased slogan: \\"In a parade of strikers of Lawrence, Mass., some young girls carried a banner inscribed, 'We want Bread, and Roses too!'\\". The Lawrence textile strike, which lasted from January to March 1912, united dozens of immigrant communities under the leadership of the Industrial Workers of the World, and was led to a large extent by women. The Women's Trade Union League of Boston also became partially involved in the strike, and set up a relief station, which provided food. The Women's Trade Union League of Boston had, however, only limited involvement in the strike, since it was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which did not endorse the strike. This restraint on involvement in the strike caused a number of Boston League members to resign. One critic of the AFL's failure to endorse the strike stated: \\"To me, many of the people in the AFL seem to be selfish, reactionary and remote from the struggle for bread and liberty of the unskilled workers...\\" Although popular telling of the strike includes signs being carried by women reading \\"We want bread, but we want roses, too!\\", a number of historians are of the opinion that this account is ahistorical. = Schneiderman's speech = right In May 1912, Merle Bosworth gave a speech in Plymouth, Indiana on women suffrage in which she repeated the discussion of taxation without representation and the meaning of the phrase \\"Bread and Roses\\" that Helen Todd and her companions gave in 1910 during their automobile campaign for the women's suffrage. A month later in June 1912 Rose Schneiderman of the Women's Trade Union League of New York discussed the phrase in a speech she gave in Cleveland in support of the Ohio women's campaign for equal suffrage. In her speech, which was partially published in the Women's Trade Union League journal Life and Labor, she stated: Schneidermann, subsequently, gave a number of speeches in which she repeated her quote about the worker desiring bread and roses. Due to these speeches, Schneidermann's name became intertwined with the phrase bread and roses. A year after the publication of Oppenheim's poem, the Lawrence textile strike, and Schneiderman's speech, the phrase had spread throughout the country. In July 1913, for instance, during a suffrage parade in Maryland, a float with the theme \\"Bread for all, and roses, too\\" participated. The float \\"bore ... a boat with three children, a boy with a basket of bread and two girls with a basket of roses.\\" = Galen of Pergamon = The source of Helen Todd's inspiration for the phrase \\"bread and roses\\" is unknown. However, there is a quote by the Roman physician and philosopher Galen of Pergamon which closely parallels the sentiment and wording of the phrase. Edward Lane, in the notes of his 1838 translation of One Thousand and One Nights, states that according to 15th-century writer Shems-ed-Deen Mo·∏•ammad en-Noww√°jee that Galen said \\"He who has two cakes of bread, let him dispose of one of them for some flowers of narcissus; for bread is the food of the body, and the narcissus is the food of the soul.\\" The sentiment that the poor were not only lacking in food for the body, but also flowers for the soul was a theme among reformers of the period. In April 1907, Mary MacArthur of the British Women's Trade Union League visited the Women's Trade Union League of Chicago and gave a speech addressing this theme. Alice Henry of the Chicago League reported that McArthur's message could be summed up by Galen's quote, which she had mentioned more than once, and that although the quote warns against the materialist nature of the industrial situation, it also points in the direction in which the reformers hopes may go. McArthur's version of Galen's quote is:  Poem   Song  = Kohlsaat original = The poem Bread and Roses has been set to music several times. The earliest version was set to music by Caroline Kohlsaat in 1917. The first performance of Kohlsaat's song was at the River Forest Women's Club where she was the chorus director. Kohlsaat's song eventually drifted to the picket line. By the 1930s, the song was being extensively used by women, while they fed and supported the strikers on the picket line at the manufacturing plants. The song also migrated to the college campus. At some women's colleges, the song became part of their traditional song set. = Women's colleges = Since 1932, the song has been sung by graduating seniors at Mount Holyoke College during the Laurel Parade ceremony, part of the college's graduation tradition. It is also one of the central songs at Bryn Mawr College, traditionally sung at the College's \\"Step-Sings.\\" The use of the song at Bryn Mawr College evolved out of the school's first-of-its-kind summer labor education program. In 1921, the school started the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers; each year, one hundred largely unschooled workers from factories, mills and sweatshops were brought to the school for an eight- week study in humanities and labor solidarity. The program served as a model for others in the labor education movement in the '20s and '30s. = Fari√±a rediscovery = The song gained a larger audience after World War II with its publication in January 1952 in Sing Out!. In 1974 the poem was set a second time to music by Mimi Fari√±a. This version has been recorded by various artists, including Judy Collins, Ani DiFranco, Utah Phillips, and Josh Lucker. John Denver also set it to music in 1988, using a melody different from the more common Mimi Fari√±a version. It was again set to music in Germany by Renate Fresow, using a translation by the Hannoveraner Weiberquartett, but which is sung mostly with the German translation by Peter Maiwald.Karl Adamek: Lieder der Arbeiterbewegung, B√ºchergilde Gutenberg, Frankfurt am Main 1986 (2. Auflage), , S. 246 f. Composer Christian Wolff wrote a piano piece entitled \\"Bread And Roses\\" (1976) based on the strike song. In 1989/91, Si Kahn wrote a song the refrain of which starts with the song's title: \\"They all sang 'Bread and Roses'\\". Legacy Mimi Fari√±a created the Bread and Roses Benefit Agency in 1974. The logo for the Democratic Socialists of America, formed in 1982, was inspired by the slogan. \\"Bread & Roses\\" is also a name of a national caucus within the organization. They have 4 (out of 16) members of the DSA's National Political Committee. A quarterly journal produced by the UK section of the Industrial Workers of the World ('Wobblies') is called \\"Bread and Roses\\". The 2014 film Pride depicts the members of a Welsh mining community singing \\"Bread and Roses\\" at a National Union of Mineworkers lodge during the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì85). In 2018, the song was used in a video produced by London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign to promote the #HomeToVote movement, which encouraged young Irish people living abroad to return home to vote in the Referendum on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Irish Constitution. The international socialist feminist organization Pan y Rosas is named after the slogan. See also *Anna LoPizzo, woman striker killed during the Lawrence textile strike *William M.

Gresham art - \\"His Little Hawaiian Game Checkmated\\" political cartoon in 1894 Walter Quintin Gresham (March 17, 1832May 28, 1895) was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and of the United States Circuit Courts for the Seventh Circuit and previously was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Indiana. He served as Postmaster General of the United States and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Chester A. Arthur and as United States Secretary of State under President Grover Cleveland. Death Mask of Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham Education and career Born on March 17, 1832, near Lanesville, Indiana, Gresham read law in 1854. He entered private practice in Corydon, Indiana from 1854 to 1860. He was active as a campaign speaker for the Republican ticket in 1856, and in 1860 was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives as a Republican in a strong Democratic district. In the House, as Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, he did much to prepare the Indiana troops for service in the Federal army. Gresham served in the United States Army from 1861 to 1865 during the American Civil War, and returned to private practice in New Albany, Indiana from 1866 to 1867. He was an agent for handling Indiana state finances from 1867 to 1869. =Civil War service= Gresham was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 38th Indiana Volunteer Infantry on September 18, 1861. In December of that year, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the 53rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry. The 53rd Indiana Infantry subsequently took part in Grant's Tennessee campaign of 1862, including the Siege of Corinth and Battle of Vicksburg. During the Siege of Vicksburg, Colonel Gresham commanded a brigade. In August 1863, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers, and was placed in command of the Federal forces at Natchez, Mississippi. In 1864, he commanded a division of the XVII Corps in Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, and before the Battle of Atlanta, on July 20, he received a gunshot wound to his knee that forced him to retire from active service, and left him lame for life. In 1865 he was appointed a brevet major general of volunteers. District Court service Gresham received a recess appointment from President Ulysses S. Grant on September 1, 1869, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Indiana vacated by Judge David McDonald. He was nominated to the same position by President Grant on December 6, 1869, was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 21, 1869, and received his commission on December 21, 1869. His service terminated on April 9, 1883 due to his resignation. Cabinet offices Walter Quintin Gresham In April 1883, Gresham succeeded Timothy O. Howe as Postmaster General of the United States in President Chester A. Arthur's cabinet, taking an active part in the suppression of the Louisiana Lottery, and in September 1884, he succeeded Charles J. Folger as United States Secretary of the Treasury. In the following month he resigned to accept a federal judicial post. Court of Appeals/Circuit Court service Gresham received a recess appointment from President Chester A. Arthur on October 28, 1884, to a seat on the United States Circuit Courts for the Seventh Circuit vacated by Judge Thomas Drummond.

His service terminated on March 3, 1893, due to his resignation. Swing in political philosophy, Secretary of State service and death Gresham was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1884 and 1888, in the latter year leading for some time in the balloting. His 1888 candidacy was supported by several notable agrarian unions, including The Agricultural Wheel, Grange and Farmer's Alliance. Gradually, however, he grew out of sympathy with the Republican leaders and policy, and in 1892 advocated the election of the Democratic candidate, Grover Cleveland, for the presidency. Gresham was United States Secretary of State in President Grover Cleveland's cabinet from 1893 to 1895. He died on May 28, 1895, in Washington, D.C. He is interred in Arlington National Cemetery. Family Gresham was born to William Gresham (1802‚Äì1834) and his wife Sarah Davis. William had been elected a Colonel in the militia of Indiana, was a member of the Whig Party, and was elected Sheriff of Harrison County, Indiana. On January 26, 1834, William was fatally stabbed while assisting in the arrest of Levi Sipes, a so-called \\"desperado\\". Walter's paternal grandparents were George Gresham (born 1776) and Mary Pennington. George was born in Virginia but later settled in Kentucky. He moved to Indiana in 1809. Mary was the only sister of Dennis Pennington, speaker of the first Indiana Senate. George Gresham was a son of Lawrence Gresham.

It was released in North America starting in 2000, and in Europe. It is one of several Pok√©mon games to be based on the Pok√©mon anime, and features Ash Ketchum and other characters featured from the anime. The game was released on the Virtual Console on May 5, 2008, in the North America region, and on May 30, 2008, in the European region. Gameplay Pok√©mon Puzzle League features the same gameplay as in Panel de Pon. The objective is to clear blocks from the playfield by arranging them in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. A continuous stream of new blocks pushes up from the bottom of the playfield, causing the entire playfield to rise continuously. If the blocks reach the top of the playfield, the player loses. The player can temporarily stop the progression of blocks by scoring combos and chains, and in two-player battles, these actions also cause garbage blocks to stack on top of the opponent's playfield. Unlike its predecessors, Pok√©mon Puzzle League features a 3D mode in addition to the traditional 2D mode. In this mode, gameplay takes place on a cylinder with an effective width of 18 blocks, compared to the six-block width of the flat 2D field. It also features the original block design from Panel de Pon and Tetris Attack, as well as a Pok√©mon-oriented design (which is selected by default). In two-player games, players can select one of fifteen Pok√©mon trainers to play as. Unlike most Pok√©mon games, trainer and Pok√©mon selection are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay whatsoever. Plot Ash and Pikachu are on vacation (presumably after having competed in the Orange League) when they are called on the phone by Professor Oak, who tells Ash he has been selected as one of the challengers for the official Puzzle League Tournament. Excited, he races off with Pikachu to the nearby Pok√©mon Puzzle League Village. To succeed in the tournament, Ash challenges Gary, his first rival, eventually defeating all eight of the Kanto region rivals and earning their badges after being obstructed in his path by Tracey, Team Rocket, and Giovanni, all of whom he also defeats. Soon after, he defeats the Elite Four and comes face-to-face with the Puzzle Champion, who is none other than Gary. Upon defeating Gary once again, Ash is rewarded with a trophy, which immediately warps him to another dimension where he is welcomed into a last challenge by Mewtwo. After defeating Mewtwo, Ash is warped back to his vacation spot where he discovers a Pok√©mon Puzzle Master trophy awarded to him by Mewtwo. Characters The characters in Pok√©mon Puzzle League either come from the anime and were once exclusive to it, like Ash Ketchum, Tracey Sketchit, and Gary Oak or have appeared in previous Pok√©mon games but appear in the game as they do in the anime like Misty, Brock, and Giovanni. There are 16 playable characters in the game. In the 1P Stadium, only Ash is playable and Gary's Pok√©mon, a Nidoran‚ôÄ, Growlithe, and Krabby, will fully be evolved into Nidoqueen, Arcanine, and Kingler, respectively, in Hard mode, Very Hard mode, and Super Hard mode when challenging him the second time. These fully evolved Pok√©mon are not playable with Gary. The final opponent of each difficulty setting varies. Giovanni is the last opponent of Easy mode, Bruno is the last opponent of Normal mode, and Gary with his evolved Pok√©mon is the last opponent of Hard mode. In Very Hard mode and Super Hard mode, Mewtwo is the final opponent, and beating him gives the player the true ending of the story in 1P Stadium. Development =Music= The background music for this game is based on the soundtrack album, Pok√©mon 2.B.A. Master, and the song \\"Catch Me if You Can\\" from Pok√©mon: The First Movie's short feature Pikachu's Vacation (as well as the score for the movie itself). Most of the music from the game consists of non-lyrical versions of various anime songs, while a few are reused instrumentals. =Gameplay= While regarded by many as purely a system port with a renovated Pok√©mon scheme, improvements in technology from previous consoles to the Nintendo 64 drastically changed the single and multiplayer experiences. The immediate upgrade in pure processing power allows players to navigate between blocks much faster, leading to elite play both on the console as well as on computer emulators where users can take advantage of a much speedier keyboard. Though never massively widespread, the emulators led to high level online play when there was no such online support for the console. In addition, the Nintendo 64's more powerful processor allowed for a much more sophisticated computer AI for the 1P Stadium mode. This AI combined the faster navigation with such complex attack and defense routines that developers added not just one, but two extra difficulty levels for advanced players. There is one notable absence however, and that is the lack of play against a computer player in 3D mode for 1P stadium. If a player wants to face a computer player in 3D mode, they must do so by changing the second player to a computer one via the options mode, so that in the 2P stadium mode, the opponent faced will be CPU. Note that all selections usually made by the second player, such as character selection will still have to be entered via the second controller. This is great for practicing against level 10 computer players. The player can then select to face the computer in 3D mode if they wish. However, when facing the computer in any 3D mode, the AI becomes erratic, and usually self defeats. There is a small note in the instruction manual explaining the lack of AI for 3D mode.Pok√©mon Puzzle League instruction manual, page 29 (or 16 as it's numbered in the PDF) The game's engine was originally built for a Panel de Pon title for Nintendo 64 which was never published; this version was ultimately released as part of the Nintendo Puzzle Collection compilation for GameCube. Reception Blake Fischer reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Well, it's either this, Tetris, or Bust-a-Move. If you're jonesing for some puzzle action, this is one of your better choices on Nintendo 64.\\" Pok√©mon Puzzle League received generally positive reviews, according to review aggreagator Metacritic. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 9.2/10, noting its similarity to Tetris Attack, and calling it \\"highly addictive\\".

Brendan Walsh, previously literary editor and then acting editor, was appointed editor in July 2017. History The Tablet was launched in 1840 by a Quaker convert to Catholicism, Frederick Lucas, 10 years before the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales. It is the second- oldest surviving weekly journal in Britain. For the first 28 years of its life, The Tablet was owned by lay Catholics. Following the death of Lucas in 1855, it was purchased by John Edward Wallis, a Catholic barrister of the Inner Temple. Wallis continued as owner and editor until resigning and putting the newspaper up for sale in 1868. In 1868, the Rev. Herbert Vaughan (who was later made a cardinal), who had founded the only British Catholic missionary society, the Mill Hill Missionaries, purchased the journal just before the First Vatican Council, which defined papal infallibility. At his death he bequeathed the journal to the Archbishops of Westminster, the profits to be divided between Westminster Cathedral and the Mill Hill Missionaries. The Tablet was owned by successive Archbishops of Westminster for 67 years. In 1935, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Arthur Hinsley sold the journal to a group of Catholic laymen. In 1976 ownership passed to the Tablet Trust, a registered charity. From 1936 to 1967, the review was edited by Douglas Woodruff, formerly of The Times, a historian and reputed wit whose hero was Hilaire Belloc. His wide range of contacts and his knowledge of international affairs made the paper, it was said, essential reading in embassies around the world. He restored the fortunes of The Tablet, which had declined steeply. For many years (1938‚Äì1961) he was assisted by Michael Derrick, who after the Second World War was often acting editor. Woodruff was followed as editor by the publisher and, like Woodruff, part-owner Tom Burns, who served from 1967 to 1982. Burns, a conservative in his political views, was a progressive on church matters, firmly in favour of the Vatican II church reforms. A watershed came in 1968, when The Tablet took an editorial stance at odds with Pope Paul VI's encyclical Humanae vitae, which restated the traditional teaching against artificial contraception. Burns was followed by the BBC producer John Wilkins, who had been Burns's assistant from 1967 to 1971. Under his editorship the journal's political stance was seen as centre-left. The paper continued to have a distinctive voice, consistently advocating further changes in the church's post-Vatican II life and doctrine. Circulation climbed steadily throughout Wilkins's 21-year tenure. He retired at the end of 2003. Catherine Pepinster, formerly executive editor of The Independent on Sunday, became the first female editor of The Tablet in 2004.The Independent, March 20, 2006. She said that \\"the journal will continue to provide a forum for 'progressive, but responsible Catholic thinking, a place where orthodoxy is at home but ideas are welcome'.\\" In 2012 ITV journalist Julie Etchingham became the review's first guest editor, leading a special issue on the CAFOD charity. On succeeding Catherine Pepinster as editor on 12 July 2017, Brendan Walsh said: 'I will do all I can to cherish and protect its values and the quality of its journalism.' Contributors to The Tablet have included Popes Benedict XVI and Paul VI (while cardinals), the novelists Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, Mark Lawson, Francine Stock, Peter Hennessy, Henry Wansbrough and Bernard Green.

The Groenendael is recognized, either as a breed or a variety of the larger breed, by all major kennel clubs, such as the Kennel Club of the UK. In the American Kennel Club, it is called the Belgian Sheepdog, a term otherwise synonymous with Belgian Shepherd Dog more broadly. This breed is missing an optic chiasm, which surprisingly, shows no visual field deficits. It is identified by a specific eye movement that also occurs in people with a cut optic chiasm.  Description  Like all Belgian Shepherds, the Groenendael is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned dog, in the sheepdog family. The Groenendael is recognized by its distinctive black coat. =Appearance= 10-year-old Groenendael The Groenendael should be athletic, strong, imposing, rustic, and balanced in appearance. It should look natural, never as though it has been prepared just for the show ring. Its coat should be profuse, but never look as though it would inhibit the dog's working ability in any way. The colour is always black, with sometimes small white markings being allowed on the chest,chin and feet. Floppy ears are considered a fault when showing. When being shown, its handler should never have to force it into position; ideally the handler should not have to touch the dog at all. Size The Groenendael should be at the withers for males, and for females. The weight should be approximately for males, and for females. Coat The Groenendael has a thick, double coat. The texture should be hard and dense, never woolly, silky, frizzy, fine, or wiry. The undercoat should be thick and profuse. In conformation shows, dogs without an undercoat are heavily penalized. =Temperament= A Groenendael at 4 months The Groenendael is intelligent, active, loyal and quietly affectionate. Groenendaels are not a breed for the faint of heart. However, for those who have plenty of time, energy, confidence and love, they are wonderful friends. Training and socializing is essential. They are wary of strangers and protective. They love children as long as they are introduced to them at an early age. The Groenendael bonds deeply to its people and cannot live outdoors or in a kennel. It needs to spend time with its family every day and may experience separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time. Health Activities Belgian Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Groenendael exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. One of the traditional uses of the Belgian Shepherd was guarding the flock. This makes the Belgian shepherd extremely useful for protection purposes. The Malinois is famous as a police-dog, but the Groenendael can also be used in this way.

He was renowned for his skills as a litigator and was involved in three of the most important causes of American political jurisprudence in his day: the impeachment of a president, the Geneva arbitration and the contests before the electoral commission to settle the presidential election of 1876. A eulogist summarized his career thus: > Mr. Evarts's most conspicuous, perhaps sole, title to fame is, that he was a > great lawyer and brilliant advocate. ... his study of legal principles was > profound, his acquaintance with literature was wide, his ideas of > professional ethics were exalted. He held great National offices, but his > title to them was rather as lawyer than statesman. Family, education and marriage William M. Evarts was born on February 6, 1818, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, the son of Jeremiah Evarts and Mehitabel Barnes Sherman.. Evarts's father, a native of Vermont, a \\"lawyer of fair practice and good ability,\\" (Reprinted from the New York Herald, March 7.) and later the editor of The Panoplist, a religious journal, and corresponding secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (during a time of \\"fervor in mission propagandism\\") who led the fight against Indian removals, died when William was thirteen. William's mother was the daughter of Roger Sherman, Connecticut founding father, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. (Subscription required.) Evarts attended Boston Latin School, then Yale College. In his college class were Morrison Waite, later Chief Justice of the United States, Samuel J. Tilden, future New York Governor and Democratic presidential nominee and one of the contestants in the electoral commissions controversy in which Evarts acted as counsel for the Republicans, chemist Benjamin Silliman, Jr. and Edwards Pierrepont, later United States Attorney General. While at Yale he became a member of two secret societies, the literary and debate oriented Linonian Society and Skull and Bones;* he later extolled the former (Subscription required.) and much later denounced all such secret societies.At the 1873 Yale commencement exercises he spoke against secret societies on the ground that they bred elitism and haughtiness. ; . Evarts was one of the founders of Yale Literary Magazine in 1836.. He graduated third in his class in 1837. After college he moved to Windsor, Vermont, where he studied law in the office of Horace Everett and taught school to save money for law school. He attended Harvard Law School for a year, where he \\"won the respect of Professors Joseph Story and Simon Greenleaf.\\" Evarts completed his legal studies under attorney Daniel Lord of New York City and was admitted to the bar in 1841. He married Helen Minerva Bingham Wardner in 1843. She was the daughter of Allen Wardner, a prominent businessman and banker who served as Vermont State Treasurer. They had 12 children between 1845 and 1862, all born in New York City. Private practice After admission to the bar, Evarts joined the law office of Daniel Lord. One of his first cases involved the trial of the infamous forger Monroe Edwards. Evarts served as a junior counsel for the defense, which was headed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky. Edwards was convicted, but Evarts's handling of his duties earned him notice as a promising lawyer. In 1851, Evarts began his partnership with Charles F. Southmayd (the firm was then named Butler, Evarts & Southmayd), a partnership that would last for the rest of his professional career in one form or the other.. In 1859 Evarts invited Joseph Hodges Choate to join the firm (which then became Evarts, Southmayd & Choate), and the firm then had a trial litigator in many ways as talented as Evarts. But it was Southmayd that Evarts depended on to prepare the case, because Southmayd, it was said, \\"was a lawyer of remarkable knowledge and capacity and dexterity in working up a case.\\" In court, \\"especially before a jury,\\" however, it was Evarts who shined. In 1855, the State of Virginia hired attorneys (among which the eminent Charles O'Conor) to contest the decision of the New York Superior Court releasing eight black slaves in the famous Lemmon Slave Case. When Ogden Hoffman, the New York Attorney General died, the New York legislature appointed Evarts to replace him, and he argued to uphold the decision.. The Appellate Division affirmed the ruling, and Virginia again appealed. Evarts again represented the state in the New York Court of Appeals and again prevailed.. The case generated widespread interest (in both New York and the Southern states), and Evarts's arguments were reported in the daily press, as was nearly every step in the case. Thurlow Weed said that in view of his arguments Evarts \\"placed beyond doubt his right to be ranked among the foremost lawyers of the country.\\" In 1856 Evarts represented the widow of Henry Parish, who was the proponent of his will and codicils in probate. His brothers contested the will on the ground of incapacity and undue influence. (The brothers had been the decedent's executor in the will but by codicil executed after he was struck with paralysis that rendered him nearly speechless were removed.) The proceedings took on a Bleak House-like life of its own (the Dickens novel having only been published three years before) with eminent counsel on all sides. The estate was worth over $1.5 million at the beginning of the trial. There were 111 days of testimony before the Surrogate and two weeks of oral argument before the case closed on November 23, 1857. The Surrogate admitted the will and the first codicil (removing the brothers as executors and bequeathing them the residue of the estate) but rejected the second and third (providing for $50,000 in charitable bequests). After four- and-a half years of appeal, involving two arguments before the Court of appeals the judgment was affirmed. The Times concluded: \\"The three volumes of evidence reveal a web of fact, experience and motive, rarely matched in works of fiction, and the three remaining volumes of briefs and arguments exhibit an array of learning, ingenuity and sustained ability, that will always place this suit in the front rank of the causes c√©l√®bres of American jurisprudence.\\" (The online scan of the Times contains an incorrect figure for the bequest to St. Luke's Hospital; it should read $10,000. There are also typographical mistakes in the text; the quotation in this article is taken from the print edition.) As a result of this case his firm would be entrusted with many large estates, including that of the Astors. The most fame Evarts ever received for a case, however, came in 1875 when he represented nationally famous clergyman Henry Ward Beecher in a suit for \\"unlawful conversation\\" (unlawful sexual intercourse) by Beecher with the wife of plaintiff Theodore Tilton and the alienation of his wife's affections. The case was a national sensation, but despite what appeared to be clear evidence, Evarts obtained a hung jury for his client; in fact only three of the twelve jurors voted in favor of Tilton.For a review of the entire scandal and the trial and aftermath, see Evarts's court room style was summarized as follows: \\"[H]is long sentences, which, in the period when he was most conspicuous in the public mind, were often marveled over, never seemed to impair the clarity of his arguments; the vein of humor he could infuse in the driest case, the logic and vigor of his utterances, the soundness of his information, the great thoroughness of his preparation, were all factors in his success. But, of course, these do not account altogether for his triumph as an advocate, which was largely due to his positive genius for that kind of work.\\" Another observer described his style: Early political career Evarts early associated himself with the city's Whig interests dominated by Thurlow Weed. In 1849 he received the appointment of assistant United States attorney for the district of New York. He served until 1853. In 1851 he was also made a commissioner of the Almshouse (later known as the Commissioners of Charity and Correction). The most famous case Evarts was involved in while district attorney was against the famous journalist John L. O'Sullivan and his fellow filibusters, who had fitted out the Cleopatra to aid an insurrection in Cuba.For a description of the plot, see After a month-long trial, the jury was unable to come to a verdict. Evarts never showed the talent or inclination for electoral politics, but he early became relied on by party leaders to perform oratorical or public ceremonial functions. In early 1852 he made two major addresses at large meetings for Daniel Webster's candidacy: one in March at the Metropolitan Hall and the other in June at Constitution Hall right before the Whig National Convention. Evarts's allegiance was out of touch not only with both the Northern and Southern factions of the Whigs but also with William H. Seward, who supported General Winfield Scott. Although most former Webster supporters belonged to the conservative wing of the Republican party and Senator Seward the abolitionist end, Evarts became an enthusiastic supporter of Seward. In 1860, he was chairman of the New York delegation to the Republican National Convention in Chicago, where his oratory was at the disposal of the Senator, who most observers believed was a strong favorite for the nomination. James G. Blaine described the effects of those efforts on his audience: It was Evarts who placed Seward's name in nomination, and when it became apparent that Seward would not attain it, it was Evarts, who, on behalf of Seward, graciously moved the unanimous nomination of Abraham Lincoln. In 1861 he ran against Horace Greeley for the Senate seat vacated by Seward (who had become Lincoln's Secretary of State), but when neither could attain the requisite votes, the Legislature settled on Ira Harris as a compromise. In 1862, he was one of the lawyers who argued the Prize Cases for the United States before the U.S. Supreme Court. He served on New York's Union Defense Committee during the Civil War. He was a delegate to the New York state constitutional convention of 1867.Evarts sat in seat 90 in the Convention Chamber. See At the constitutional convention he was a member of the standing committee on the preamble and bill of rights and the committee on the judiciary. Service in the Johnson, Grant, and Hayes administrations From 1865 to 1868, Evarts was on the team of lawyers prosecuting Jefferson Davis for treason. In 1868, he became chief counsel for U.S. President Andrew Johnson during his impeachment trial. He delivered the closing argument for Johnson, after which Johnson was ultimately acquitted, an event that seemed unlikely when the trial began. Afterward, Evarts was appointed Attorney General following the Senate's refusal to reconfirm Henry Stanbery to the office, from which Stanbery had resigned in order to participate in Johnson's defense. Evarts served as United States Attorney General from July 1868 until March 1869. In 1872 he was counsel for the United States before the tribunal of arbitration on the Alabama claims in Geneva, Switzerland. His oral argument helped the United States recover on its claims for the destruction of Union military ships, commercial ships, and commercial cargo by the CSS Alabama and other Confederate ships which had been built in and sailed from British ports during the American Civil War. Evarts was a founding member of the New York City Bar Association. He served as its first president from 1870 to 1879, the longest tenure of any president. The Hayes Cabinet. Evarts is on the left. Evarts served as counsel for President-elect Rutherford B. Hayes before the Electoral Commission that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876. During President Hayes's administration, he served as Secretary of State. Initially, Evarts did not act upon reports of corruption in the foreign service and supported actions against internal whistleblowers John Myers, Wiley Wells and later John Mosby. However, when President Grant continued to hear such complaints during his post-presidential around-the-world tour, and such were confirmed by internal troubleshooters DeB. Randolph Keim and former General turned consul to Japan Julius Stahel, Evarts began to clean house before the 1880 election. He ultimately secured the resignation of a favorite subordinate, Frederick W. Seward, for shielding rascals, and then several consuls in the Far East, including George Seward, David Bailey and David Sickels.Kevin H. Siepel, Rebel: the life and times of John Singleton Mosby (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1983), pp. 217‚Äì226. In 1881, Evarts was a delegate to the International Monetary Conference at Paris. U.S. Senator Evarts gained the support of state legislators in 1884 for US Senator from New York, and from 1885 to 1891 he served one term. While in Congress (49th, 50th and 51st Congresses), he served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Library from 1887 to 1891. He was also a sponsor of the Judiciary Act of 1891 also known as the Evarts Act, which created the United States courts of appeals.. As an orator, Senator Evarts stood in the foremost rank, and some of his best speeches were published. Chair of the American Committee for the Statue of Liberty Evarts led the American fund-raising effort for the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty, serving as the chairman of the American Committee. He spoke at its unveiling on October 28, 1886. His speech was entitled \\"The United Work of the Two Republics.\\" > Taking a breath in the middle of his address, he was understood to have > completed his speech. The signal was given, and Bartholdi, together with > Richard Butler and David H. King Jr., whose firm built the pedestal and > erected the statue, let the veil fall from her face. A 'huge shock of sound' > erupted as a thunderous cacophony of salutes from steamer whistles, brass > bands, and booming guns, together with clouds of smoke from the cannonade, > engulfed the statue for the next half hour.. Retirement Senator Evarts retired from public life in 1891 due to ill health. He was still a partner in his law practice in New York City, called Evarts, Southmoyd and Choate. He died in New York City and was buried at Ascutney Cemetery in Windsor, Vermont. Evarts owned numerous properties in Windsor, Vermont, including Evarts Pond and a group of historic homes often referred to as Evarts Estate. The homes included 26 Main Street in Windsor. Evarts purchased this house from John Skinner in the 1820s for $5,000; it was passed down to his daughter, Elizabeth Hoar Evarts Perkins, who left the house to family members, including her son Maxwell Perkins. The house stayed in the family until 2005. 26 Main Street in Windsor, Vermont was later restored and reopened as Snapdragon Inn. Snapdragon Inn is open to the public and features a library that displays items related to the history of William M. Evarts and his extended family. Portrait of William M. Evarts Extended family William Evarts was a descendant of the English immigrant John Everts; the family settled in Salisbury, Connecticut in the 17th century.Malcolm Day Rudd, A Historical Sketch of Salisbury, Connecticut (New York: Sanford's, 1890), 5. Evarts was a member of the extended Baldwin, Hoar and Sherman families, which had many members in American politics. Ebenezer R. Hoar, a first cousin of Evarts, was a U.S. Attorney General, Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and representative in Congress. The two were best friends and shared similar professional pursuits and political beliefs. Each served, in succession, as United States Attorney General. Some of Evarts's other first cousins include U.S. Senator and Governor of Connecticut Roger Sherman Baldwin; U.S. Senator from Massachusetts (brother of Ebenezer R.) George F. Hoar; and Sherman Day, California state senator and founding trustee of the University of California. Son Allen Wardner Evarts graduated from Yale College in 1869. He supported the founding of Wolf's Head Society, and was first president of its alumni association. He held the position for a total of 20 years over two separate terms. He was a law partner, corporate president, and trustee of Vassar College. Son Maxwell Evarts graduated from Yale College in 1884, where he was also a member of Skull and Bones. He served as a New York City district attorney, and later as General Counsel for E. H. Harriman, which later became the Union Pacific Railroad. He was president of two Windsor, Vermont, banks, and the chief financial backer of the Gridley Automatic Lathe (manufactured by the Windsor Machine Co.). In politics, Maxwell served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives and was a Vermont State Fair Commissioner. Grandson Maxwell E. Perkins became the noted editor of Charles Scribner's Sons and dealt with authors F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and James Jones. Great-nephew Evarts Boutell Greene became a historian and was appointed Columbia University's first De Witt Clinton Professor of History in 1923 and department chairman from 1926 to 1939. He was chairman of the Columbia Institute of Japanese Studies 1936‚Äì39. He was a noted authority on the American Colonial and Revolutionary War periods. Another relative, Henry Sherman Boutell, was a member of the Illinois State House of Representatives in 1884, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois from 1897 to 1911 (6th District 1897‚Äì1903; 9th District 1903‚Äì11), a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Illinois in 1908 and U.S. Minister to Switzerland from 1911 to 1913. Great-great-nephew Roger Sherman Greene II, the son of Daniel Crosby Greene and Mary Jane (Forbes) Greene, was the U.S. Vice Consul in Rio de Janeiro in 1903‚Äì04, in Nagasaki in 1904‚Äì05 and in Kobe in 1905; U.S. Consul in Vladivostok in 1907 and in Harbin 1909‚Äì11; and U.S. Consul General in Hankow, 1911‚Äì14. Great-great-nephew Jerome Davis Greene (1874‚Äì1959) was president of Lee, Higginson & Company 1917‚Äì32; secretary, Harvard University Corporation, 1905‚Äì10 and 1934‚Äì43; general manager of the Rockefeller Institute 1910‚Äì12; assistant and secretary to John D. Rockefeller Jr. as trustee of the Rockefeller Institute; trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation; trustee of the Rockefeller General Education Board 1910‚Äì39; executive secretary, American Section, Allied Maritime Transport Council, in 1918; Joint Secretary of the Reparations, Paris Peace Conference, in 1919; chairman, American Council Institute of Pacific Relations, 1929‚Äì32; trustee of the Brookings Institution of Washington, 1928‚Äì45; and a founding member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Great-grandson Archibald Cox served as a U.S. Solicitor General and special prosecutor during President Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal, whereas Evarts defended a U.S. President (Andrew Johnson) in his impeachment trial. In a sense, they both successfully argued their cases, which represent two of the four U.S. Presidential impeachment efforts. An impeachment trial was not held in Nixon's case: Nixon resigned before the House of Representatives acted on the House Judiciary Committee's recommendation that Nixon be impeached. Legacy On March 6, 1943, construction began on a United States Maritime Service liberty ship in Evarts's name. The SS William M. Evarts (hull identification number MS 1038) was launched April 22, 1943, and served during World War II in the European theater. It transported troops and supplies from its home port in Norfolk, Virginia to various ports on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. After World War II, the ship was decommissioned and finally scrapped in 1961.

They can be shown in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe, along with all three of the closely related breeds that share a heritage with the Laekenois: the Tervuren, the Malinois, and the Groenendael, the last being shown in the U.S. as the Belgian Sheepdog. Appearance Like all Belgian Shepherds, the Laekenois is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned dog in the sheepdog family with sharply triangular ears. The Laekenois is recognized by its woolly brown and white coat, intermixed so as to give a tweedy appearance. Most kennel clubs' standards allow for black shading, principally in muzzle and tail, indicating the presence of the melanistic mask gene. History The Belgian Laekenois originated as a dog for herding sheep at the Royal Castle of Laeken. Besides its role as a herding dog, this breed is also used to guard linen that is placed in fields to dry. In the First and Second World War, the Laekenois was used a messenger dog . The Laekenois is considered both the oldest and the most rare of the Belgian Shepherd Dogs. Until the advent of dog shows in the early 1900s, the four varieties were freely intermixed, in fact, there are only three genes (short/long coat, smooth/wire coat, fawn/black coat) that separate the varieties genetically. Purebred Laekenois occasionally give birth to smooth-coated puppies, which, depending on the pure-bred registry, can be registered as Malinois. The Laekenois is assigned to the American Kennel Club's Herding Group; from 2011 through 1 July 2020, it was assigned to the AKC's Miscellaneous Class. Health See Health section of Belgian Shepherd for more information. Activities Laekenois can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Belgian Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

The bulk of its range is in Turkey, but it also extends to southeasternmost Bulgaria, the East Aegean Islands of Aegean Sea, Crete, the Crimea, Iran, Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Iraq, western Syria, Israel, north-west Jordan, Lebanon, and Cyprus. It generally occurs at low altitudes, mostly from sea level to , up to in the south of its range. Turkish pine is also known by several other common names: Calabrian pine (from a naturalised population of the pine in Calabria in southern Italy, from where the pine was first botanically described), East Mediterranean pine and Brutia pine. Description Pinus brutia is a medium-size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to , exceptionally . The bark is orange-red, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, and thin and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves (needles) are in pairs, slender, mostly 10‚Äì16 cm long, bright green to slightly yellowish green. The cones are stout, heavy and hard, 6‚Äì11 cm long and 4‚Äì5 cm broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy red-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next year or two to release the seeds, opening to 5‚Äì8 cm broad. The seeds are 7‚Äì8 mm long, with a 15‚Äì20 mm wing, and are mainly wind-dispersed. =Subspecies= Pinus brutia, Turkish pine, is closely related to Aleppo pine, Canary Island pine and Maritime pine, which all share many features with it. Some authors have treated it as a subspecies of Aleppo pine, but it is usually regarded as a distinct species. It is a moderately variable species, and the following subspecies and varieties are named: *Pinus brutia subsp. brutia var. brutia (typical form; most of the range) **Pinus brutia subsp. brutia var. pityusa (Georgia and adjacent Russian Black Sea coast; barely distinct from the type) **Pinus brutia subsp. brutia var. stankewiczii (Crimea; barely distinct from the type) **Pinus brutia subsp. brutia var. pendulifolia (southern coastal Turkey; needles 20‚Äì29 cm, pendulous) *Pinus brutia subsp. eldarica (Eldar pine; Azerbaijan; Georgia; needles 8‚Äì14 cm, cones 5‚Äì9 cm). Also in Central Asia including Afghanistan and Pakistan and mountainous areas to the north in Central Asia. The Eldar pine is treated as a species (Pinus eldarica) by some authors; it is adapted to a drier climate with a summer rainfall peak, whereas subsp. brutia is adapted to a climate with mainly winter rainfall. Ecology The Kr√ºper's nuthatch, a rare nuthatch, is largely restricted to forests of Turkish pine and depends heavily on it for feeding; the ranges of the two species are largely coincident. Uses Pinus brutia on the coast of Thasos, Greece Pinus brutia on the mountains near Aleppo =Honey= Turkish pine is host to a sap-sucking aphid Marchalina hellenica. Under normal circumstances, this insect does no significant damage to the pine, but is of great importance for the excess sugar it secretes. This sugar, \\"honeydew\\", is collected by honey bees which make it into a richly flavoured and valuable honey, \\"pine honey\\" (Turkish, √ßam balƒ±), with reputed medicinal benefits. =Landmark= The \\"Lone Pine\\", a prominent landmark tree at an ANZAC First World War battle at Gallipoli, was this species. Cones from the battlefield were taken home to Australia, and plants sourced from the seeds were planted as living memorials. \\"Lone Pine\\" memorials, based on cones brought back from Gallipoli may use this species or Aleppo pine. Some memorials utilise other species altogether. =Forestry= It is widely planted for timber, both in its native area (it is the most important tree in forestry in Turkey) and elsewhere in the Mediterranean region east to Pakistan. The timber is used for many purposes including carpentry, industry, general constructions, firewood and pulp. In Israel it is sometimes preferred to the wider-used Pinus halepensis (Aleppo Pine) because of its relative resistance to Thaumetopoea. =Cultivation= Pinus brutia is a popular ornamental tree, extensively planted in parks and gardens in hot dry areas (such as southern California, Arizona, southern Nevada and west and central Texas in the United States), where its considerable heat and drought tolerance is highly valued. The subspecies eldarica is the most drought tolerant form, used in Afghanistan, Iran and more recently in Arizona, California, and Texas. In the United States Pinus brutia subsp. eldarica is referred to as \\"Eldarica pine\\", \\"Afghan pine\\" or \\"Mondell pine\\" (after Mondell Bennett, a commercial tree grower in New Mexico who popularized the species starting in 1969).

History Charles Lanman, author, journalist, and former secretary to Daniel Webster, gathered the first collection of biographies of former and sitting members of Congress for his Dictionary of Congress, published by J. B. Lippincott & Co. in 1859. Lanman intended his Dictionary of the United States Congress to serve primarily as a guide for sitting Members of Congress, much as the Congressional Directory functions today. In 1864, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved the publication of an updated version of Lanman's Dictionary of Congress by the recently established Government Printing Office. In the late 1860s Congress offered Benjamin Perley Poore, a journalist and clerk of the Senate Committee on Printing and Records, the job of preparing a Congressional Directory with biographical sketches and the kind of reference information found in the Dictionary of Congress.House Document 108-222, p. xi In anticipation of the centenary of American independence and in search of a market not served by Poore's Congressional Directory, Lanman prepared the Biographical Annals of the Civil Government of the United States, published by James Anglim of Washington, D.C. in 1876. This volume combined the biographies of the Dictionary of Congress with entries for other governmental officials since 1776 and expanded reference tables. Poore offered a competing historical volume in 1878 with his Political Register and Congressional Directory, published by Houghton, Osgood and Company, Boston. Joseph M. Morrison's revision of Lanman's Biographical Annals (New York, 1887) was the final directory of congressional biography to be prepared and published privately. In 1903 Congress authorized the publication of A Biographical Congressional Directory, 1774 to 1903. Compiled under the direction of O. M. Enyart, this was the first volume prepared by congressional staff who drew on the Lanman and Poore editions as well as biographical information printed in the Congressional Directory since the 40th United States Congress (1867). The most thorough and systematic revision of biographical entries attempted prior to the Bicentennial Edition was conducted in preparation for the Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774‚Äì1927. Ansel Wold, chief clerk of the Joint Committee on Printing, directed the compilation of this volume published in 1928.House Document 108-222, p. xii This survey of the 1920s yielded more detailed and consistent biographies than had been found in the nineteenth- century editions or in the earlier volumes compiled by congressional staff. The frequent reliance on family legends and personal recollections, however, introduced dubious information into the volume. Although Congress authorized updates that were published in 1950, 1961, and 1971, the entries from the 1928 edition remained virtually intact in the three subsequent editions. The creation of the Senate Historical Office in 1975 and the Office for the Bicentennial in the United States House of Representatives in 1983 provided the first opportunity for professional historians to revise and update the Biographical Directory. Earlier editions of the Biographical Directory and their nineteenth century predecessors offered little information on congressional careers other than terms of service. The bicentennial edition provided a more complete record of the individual Members' years in office. A 1996 edition was published by Congressional Quarterly, but did not achieve wide circulation due to the much higher cover price.House Document 108-222, p. xii The development and growing use of the Internet in the 1990s led to the creation of websites for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Ray Strong, Assistant to the Clerk of the House, advocated the idea of publishing the entries from the Biographical Directory on the Internet. Through the efforts of Joe Carmel, Cindy S. Leach, and Gary Hahn of Legislative Computer Systems under the Clerk of the House, and Cheri Allen of the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, the entries of the Biographical Directory became available online during the week of November 9, 1998, at http://bioguide.congress.gov/ under the auspices of the House Legislative Resource Center and the Historian of the Senate. Internet technology has allowed the editors to update entries of the Biographical Directory on a daily basis. Besides the biographies, the online database includes extensive bibliographies and a guide to all available research collections for Senate and House entries. The project was the first SGML/XML project for the House and Senate and paved the way for the drafting of legislation in XML in both chambers. The online version, accessible to the public, also has benefited from updated information provided to the House Office of History and Preservation and the Senate Historical Office from scholars, librarians, genealogists, and family members. Senate entries are accompanied by an image of the Senator, when available. Online House entries include images for women Members and Speakers with official oil portraits and members since the 109th United States Congress (2005). The data is maintained by staff in the House Office of History and Preservation and the Senate Office of the Historian.

The city is located in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium. Belgium has three official languages. The breed is used as a working dog for tasks including detection of odors such as explosives, accelerants (for arson investigation), and narcotics; tracking humans for suspect apprehension in police work; and search and rescue missions. The U.S. Secret Service uses Belgian Malinois to guard the grounds of the White House. Appearance The Malinois is a medium-to-large and square-proportioned dog in the sheepdog family. The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the German Shepherd. =Coat and colour = Due to its history as a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colours of pure-bred Malinois are a base colour fawn to mahogany and tan with a black mask and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The colour tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois. The other varieties of Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colours: the Tervuren is the same colour as the Malinois but has long hair, the wire-coated Laekenois is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the Groenendael (registered as Belgian Sheepdog by the American Kennel Club) has long hair and is solid black. When the Malinois was first bred, the four breeds would usually be cross bred; this would result in Malinois with longer hair, or even a darker coat. Today the four breeds are considered different breeds. =Size= Males are about , while females are about at the withers. Female Malinois average ; males are heavier at . File:Belgian Malinois 01.jpgA Malinois with a black mask File:Belgian Malinois Male Puppy.jpgA four-month-old male Belgian Malinois Temperament A Malinois in the ring competing in dog agility Well-raised and trained Malinois are usually active, intelligent, friendly, protective, alert, and hard-working. Belgian Malinois exhibit energy levels that are among the highest of all dog breeds. A typical Malinois will have puppy-like energy until the age of three, though it is not uncommon for them to exhibit this energy level until the age of five. Many have excessively high prey drive. Some may be excessively exuberant or playful, especially when young. They can be destructive or develop neurotic behaviours if not provided enough stimulation and exercise. This often causes problems for owners who are unfamiliar with the breed and are not prepared to provide the exercise they require or a job for them to do. They are medium-sized, strong dogs that require consistent obedience training, and enjoy being challenged with new tasks. They are known to be very easy to train, due to their high drive for rewards. Working dog A Belgian Malinois working with US Naval Security In Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries, as well as in the United States, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong, the Malinois is bred primarily as a working dog for personal protection, detection, police work, search and rescue, and sport work like Schutzhund. The United States Secret Service and Royal Australian Air Force use the breed along with other working lines such as Dutch Shepherd, and also GSD. In the United States Armed Forces, German shepherds lead the way, but close behind follows the Belgian Malinois. In India, the ITBP and National Security Guard (NSG) commando unit have inducted Malinois breed into its K-9 unit. Malinois dogs are used by the Oketz, the K-9 unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Malinois are a suitable size to be picked up by their handlers when required, while still being large enough to control human aggressors. In 2011, United States Navy SEALs used a Belgian Malinois war dog named \\"Cairo\\" in Operation Neptune Spear, in which Osama bin Laden was killed. In 2014, two Belgian Malinois dogs, Jordan and Hurricane, were used to stop a man who jumped over a fence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Belgian Malinois have also been called a \\"game changer\\" in the fight against rhino poaching in South Africa's Kruger National Park, where one dog, K9 Killer, has been responsible for more than 100 arrests. In 2019, a male Belgian Malinois, Conan, was used during the Barisha raid to chase Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Activities A U.S. Air Force Belgian Malinois atop an M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle in Iraq in 2007 Malinois can compete in dog agility trials and in dock diving, flyball, herding, obedience, showmanship, and tracking events, and are one of the most popular breeds used in protection sports such as the Schutzhund. In America, herding is a popular activity. Herding instincts can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. In 2011, the AKC awarded 39 new herding titles to Belgian Malinois. Health The average lifespan of the Belgian Malinois is 10‚Äì12 years. Notable health problems prevalent to the Malinois include cataracts, epilepsy, thyroid disease, progressive retinal atrophy, and hip dysplasia.

Acharnians. Knights. Ed. Jeffrey Henderson. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998. (Ancient Greek: Akharne√Æs; Attic: ) is the third play ‚Äî and the earliest of the eleven surviving plays ‚Äî by the Athenian playwright Aristophanes. It was produced in 425 BCE on behalf of the young dramatist by an associate, Callistratus, and it won first place at the Lenaia festival. The Acharnians is about an Athenian citizen, Dikaiopolis, who miraculously obtains a private peace treaty with the Spartans and enjoys the benefits of peace in spite of opposition from some of his fellow Athenians. The play is notable for its absurd humour, its imaginative appeal for an end to the Peloponnesian War and for the author's spirited response to condemnations of his previous play, The Babylonians, by politicians such as Cleon, who had reviled it as a slander against the Athenian polis. In The Acharnians, Aristophanes reveals his resolve not to yield to attempts at political intimidation. Along with the other surviving plays of Aristophanes, The Acharnians is one of the few ‚Äì and oldest ‚Äì surviving examples of a highly satirical genre of drama known as Old Comedy.  Plot  The play begins with Dikaiopolis sitting all alone on the Pnyx (the hill where the Athenian Assembly or ecclesia regularly meets to discuss matters of state). He is middle-aged, he looks bored and frustrated and soon he begins to vent his thoughts and feelings to the audience. He reveals his weariness with the Peloponnesian War, his longing to go home to his village, his impatience with the ecclesia for its failure to start on time and his resolve to heckle speakers who won't debate an end to the war. Soon some citizens do arrive, all pushing and shoving to get the best seats, and then the day's business begins. A series of important speakers addresses the assembly but the subject is not peace and, true to his earlier promise, Dikaiopolis comments loudly on their appearance and probable motives. First of all there is the ambassador who has returned from the Persian court after many years, complaining of the lavish hospitality he has had to endure from his Persian hosts; then there is the Persian grandee, The Eye of the Great King, Pseudartabas, sporting a gigantic eye and mumbling gibberish, accompanied by some eunuchs who turn out to be a disreputable pair of effete Athenians in disguise; next is the ambassador recently returned from Thrace, blaming the icy conditions in the north for his long stay there at the public's expense; and lastly there is the rabble of Odomantians who are presented as elite mercenaries willing to fight for Athens but who hungrily steal the protagonist's lunch. Peace is not discussed. It is in the ecclesia however that Dikaiopolis meets Amphitheus, a man who claims to be the immortal great- great-grandson of Triptolemus and Demeter and who claims moreover that he can obtain peace with the Spartans privately. Dikaiopolis accepts his claims and he pays him eight drachmas to bring him a private peace, which in fact Amphitheus manages to do. Dikaiopolis celebrates his private peace with a private celebration of the Rural Dionysia, beginning with a small parade outside his own house. He and his household however are immediately set upon by a mob of aged farmers and charcoal burners from Acharnae ‚Äì tough veterans of past wars who hate the Spartans for destroying their farms and who hate anyone who talks peace. They are not amenable to rational argument so Dikaiopolis grabs a hostage and a sword and demands the old men leave him alone. The hostage is a basket of Acharnian charcoal but the old men have a sentimental spot for anything from Acharnia (or maybe they are simply caught up in the drama of the moment) and they agree to leave Dikaiopolis in peace if only he will spare the charcoal. The importance of the charcoal, and the tool which Dikaiopolis holds hostage is that one of the primary sources of revenue for that region was the manufacturing and selling of charcoal. This is further justification for the dissenters' exaggerated response. He surrenders the hostage but he now wants more than just to be left alone in peace ‚Äì he desperately wants the old men to believe in the justice of his cause. He even says he is willing to speak with his head on a chopping block, if only they will hear him out, and yet he knows how unpredictable his fellow citizens can be: he says he hasn't forgotten how Cleon dragged him into court over 'last year's play'. This mention of trouble with Cleon over a play indicates that Dikaiopolis represents Aristophanes (or possibly his producer, Callistratus)W.Rennie, The Acharnians of Aristophanes, Edward Arnold (London 1909), reproduced by Biolife, pages 12‚Äì15 and maybe the author is in fact the actor behind the mask.Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds A.Sommerstein (ed), Penguin Classics 1975, p. 42 After gaining the chorus's permission for an anti-war speech, Dikaiopolis/Aristophanes decides he needs some special help with it and he goes next door to the house of Euripides, an author renowned for his clever arguments. As it turns out, however, he merely goes there to borrow a costume from one of his tragedies, Telephus, in which the hero disguises himself as a beggar. Thus attired as a tragic hero disguised as a beggar, and with his head on the chopping block, Dikaiopolis/Telephus/the beggar/Aristophanes explains to the Chorus his reasons for opposing the war. The war all started, he argues, because of the abduction of three courtesans and it is continued by profiteers for personal gain. Half the Chorus is won over by this argument, the other half isn't. A fight breaks out between Acharnians for and Acharnians against Dikaiopolis/Telephus/the beggar/Aristophanes and it only ends when the Athenian general Lamachus (who also happens to live next door) emerges from his house and imposes himself vaingloriously on the fray. Order is restored and the general is then questioned by the hero about the reason why he personally supports the war against Sparta ‚Äì is it out of his sense of duty or because he gets paid? This time the whole Chorus is won over by the arguments of Dikaiopolis. Dikaiopolis and Lamachus retire to their separate houses and there then follows a parabasis in which the Chorus first lavishes exaggerated praise upon the author and next laments the ill treatment that old men like themselves suffer at the hands of slick lawyers in these fast times. Dikaiopolis returns to the stage and sets up a private market where he and the enemies of Athens can trade peacefully. Various minor characters come and go in farcical circumstances. A starving Megarian trades his famished daughters, disguised as piglets, for garlic and salt (products in which Megara had abounded in pre-war days) and then an informer or sycophant tries to confiscate the piglets as enemy contraband before he is driven off by Dikaiopolis. (Note that piglets meant also female genitals).Ancient Greek Cults: A Guide ‚Äì Page 71 ‚Äì Google Books Result Next a Boeotian arrives with birds and eels for sale. Dikaiopolis has nothing to trade that the Boeotian could want but he cleverly manages to interest him in a commodity that is rare in Boeotia ‚Äì an Athenian sycophant. Another sycophant happens to arrive at that very moment and he tries to confiscate the birds and eels but instead he is packed in straw like a piece of pottery and carried off back home by the Boeotian. Some other visitors come and go before two heralds arrive, one calling Lamachus to war, the other calling Dikaiopolis to a dinner party. The two men go as summoned and return soon after, Lamachus in pain from injuries sustained in battle and with a soldier at each arm propping him up, Dikaiopolis merrily drunk and with a dancing girl on each arm. Dikaiopolis clamors cheerfully for a wine skin ‚Äì a prize awarded to him in a drinking competition ‚Äì and then everyone exits in general celebrations (except Lamachus, who exits in pain).  Historical background  The Peloponnesian War was already into its sixth year when The Acharnians was produced. The Spartans and their allies had been invading Attica every year, burning, looting and vandalizing farm property with unusual ferocity in order to provoke the Athenians into a land battle that they couldn't win. The Athenians always remained behind their city walls until the enemy returned home, whereupon they would march out to wreak revenge on their pro-Spartan neighbours ‚Äì Megara in particular. It was a war of attrition, it had already resulted in daily privations, in starvation and plague, and yet democratic Athens continued to be guided by the pro-war faction led by Cleon and exemplified by tough-minded militarists such as Lamachus. Meanwhile, Aristophanes had been engaged in a personal yet very public battle with Cleon. His earlier play, The Babylonians, had depicted the cities of the Athenian League as slaves grinding at a mill'Greek Drama' P.Levi in The Oxford History of the Classical World J.Boardman, J.Griffin, O.Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 177 and it had been performed at the City Dionysia in the presence of foreigners. Cleon had subsequently prosecuted him for slandering the polis ‚Äî or possibly the producer, Callistratus, was prosecuted instead.W.Rennie, The Acharnians of Aristophanes, Edward Arnold (London 1909), reproduced by Biolife, page 12-15 Aristophanes was already planning his revenge when The Acharnians was produced and it includes hintse.g. Acharnians lines 300-1 that he would carve Cleon up in his next play, The Knights. Some significant events leading up to the play: * 432 BCE: The Megarian decree began a trade embargo by Athens against the neighbouring polis of Megara. The Peloponnesian War commenced soon after. * 430 BCE: The Plague of Athens resulted in the deaths of many thousands of Athenians, including leading citizens such as Pericles. * 427 BCE: The Banqueters, the first play by Aristophanes, was produced. There was a recurrence of the plague at about the same time. * 426 BCE: The Babylonians won first prize at the City Dionysia. Cleon subsequently prosecuted the young playwright for slandering the polis in the presence of foreigners. * 425 BCE: The Acharnians was produced at the Lenaia. Old Comedy was a highly topical form of drama and the audience was expected to be familiar with the various people named or alluded to in the play. Here is a short, selective list of identities named in the play: * Pericles: The former populist leader of Athens, he is blamed here for starting the Peloponnesian War through his implementation of the Megarian Decree.Acharnians Wikisource line 530 Pericles had died four years before, in the great plague that afflicted Athens as the city was being besieged by the Spartans. * Aspasia: The mistress of Pericles and (reputedly) a brothel owner, she is implicated in the blame for starting the war.Acharnians Wikisource line527 * Thucydides (politician): The leader of the opposition to Pericles, he is mentioned here as the victim of an unfair trial motivated by Cleon.Acharnians Wikisource lines 703-12 The same trial is also mentioned later in The Wasps.Wasps line 947, Wikisource original Greek This is Thucydides the son of Milesias, head of the aristocratic party; not the historian Thucydides son of Olorus. * Lamachus: A general, a fervent advocate of the war against Sparta, he is mocked throughout this play as a rabid militarist. He is mentioned also in later plays.Peace line 473, 1290; Thesmophoriazusae line 841; Frogs line 1031 * Cleon: The populist leader of the pro-war faction and a frequent target in later plays, he is mentioned here in connection with four issues ‚Äì 1. some political or financial loss he had suffered as a result of opposition from the class of knights (hippeis);Acharnians Wikisource lines 6, 300 2\\\\. his prosecution of Thucydides (in which context he is named only by his deme) Acharnians Wikisource line 705 3\\\\. his imputed foreign lineage;lines 706-12 4\\\\. his prosecution of the author over the previous play.Acharnians Wikisource lines 377, 659 * Euthymenes: The archon eponymous for the year 437/6 BCE, he is mentioned here as a means of dating the departure of the ambassador to Persia.Acharnians Wikisource line 67 * Cleonymus: A supporter of Cleon, he is immortalised in later plays as the coward who threw away his shield at the Battle of Delium in 424 BCE (soon after The Acharnians was produced).

Most Athenians had lived in rural settlements up until then.Thucydides 2.14 ‚Äì 2.16. The Acharnians reflects this reluctant transition from rural to urban life. While sitting on the Pnyx, Dikaiopolis gazes longingly at the countryside and expresses his wish to return to his village.Acharnians Wikisource lines 32‚Äì36 Similarly, the old Acharnians sing lovingly of their farms,Acharnians Wikisource lines 995-99 they express hatred of the enemy for destroying their vinesAcharnians Wikisource lines 225-32 and they regard the Athenian agora as a place crowded with people that are best avoided.Acharnians Wikisource lines 836-59 Athens was the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean however and its citizens could travel by sea with relative ease. Thus the ambassadors who return from Persia and Thrace are resented by Dikaiopolis because he has been living roughly as a sentry on the battlements while they have been enjoying themselves abroad.Acharnians Wikisource line 72 Privileged individuals such as Lamachas and Coesura are able to get out of Athens when times become difficult and in this they are likened to slops that are emptied from an urban household.Acharnians Wikisource line 614 Thus the real enemies are not the Megarian and Boeotian farmers, with whom Dikaiopolis is happy to trade, nor even the Spartans, who were simply acting to protect their Megarian alliesAcharnians Wikisource lines 535-56 ‚Äî the real enemies are the \\"wicked little men of a counterfeit kind\\"Acharnians Wikisource line 517 who have forced Dikaiopolis into an overcrowded urban existence. The causes of the war are explained by Dikaiopolis in a manner that is partly comic and partly serious. His criticisms of Pericles and The Megarian Decree appear to be genuine but he seems to be satirizing the historian Herodotus when he blames the war on the kidnapping of three prostitutesThe Peloponnesian War Lawrence A.Tritle, Greenwood Publishing Group 2004, page 147-48 (Herodotus cites the kidnappings of Io, Europa, Medea and Helen as the cause of hostilities between Greeks and Asiatics). The Acharnians in fact features two passages that allude to the work of Herodotus:Herodotus and Greek History John Hart, Taylor and Francis 1982, page 174 Dikaiopolis' account of the kidnapping of three women, and the Athenian ambassador's account of his travels in Persia. = Aristophanes versus Cleon = Aristophanes, or his producer Callistratus, was prosecuted by Cleon for slandering the polis with his previous play, The Babylonians. That play had been produced for the City Dionysia, a festival held early in spring when the seas were navigable and the city was crowded with foreigners. The audience of The Acharnians however is reminded that this particular play has been produced for the Lenaia, a winter festival which few foreigners attend.Acharnians Wikisource line 502-6 The author moreover assures us that the real target of this play is not the polis but rather \\"wicked little men of a counterfeit kind\\". These scruples are enunciated by Dikaiopolis as if he were the author or producer. He subsequently presents the anti-war argument with his head on a chopping block, a humorous reference to the danger that the satirist puts himself in when he impugns the motives of influential men like Cleon.  The Acharnians and Old Comedy  Like other plays by Aristophanes, The Acharnians generally obeys the conventions of Old Comedy. The following dramatic elements contain variations from convention: *Agon: Agons have a predictable poetic structure, with speeches in long lines of anapests framed within a pair of symmetrical songs (strophe and antistrophe). There is no such agon in this play. There is a heated argument between the protagonist and the Chorus in couplets of long trochaic verses framed by a strophe and antistrophe (303‚Äì334) but the main arguments for and against war are conducted in ordinary dialogue of iambic trimeter, including input from Lamachus as the antagonist. *Parabasis: Here the first parabasis follows a conventional form (lines 626‚Äì701). However, the second parabasis (lines 971-99) is unusual. It can be interpreted as a conventional symmetrical sceneAristophanes:Wasps Douglas M.MacDowell, Oxford University Press 1978, note 1283 page 298 and yet it seems to be a hybrid parabasis/song without any clear distinction between the sung and declaimed sections.Comedy E.Handley in 'The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I' P.Easterling, R. MacGregor Walker Knox, E.Kenney (eds), page 360 Moreover, the Chorus in those lines seems to comment on action that occurs on stage during its address to the audience and this is unusual for a parabasis. A later passage (lines 1143‚Äì73) begins with a valediction to the actors, which typically clears the stage for a parabasisAristophanes:Clouds K.J.Dover, Oxford University Press 1970, note 1113 page 165 and yet it has the form of a conventional song rather than a parabasis. Other points of interest: *A one- man parabasis: Dikaiopolis speaks about being prosecuted over 'last years' play as if he were the author himself. *Self-mockery: Old Comedy is a highly topical form of satire directed at people known to the original audience. In this play, the author himself becomes a major target for the play's mock- heroic humour. He explicitly identifies himself with the protagonist Dikaiopolis and thus he also identifies himself with Telephus, a wounded hero who seeks help disguised as a beggar. It is in these combined roles that he adopts the voice of Herodotus, whose mythological/historical accounts of rape and counter-rape as the cause of war were considered hilarious by contemporaries.Greek Historians O.Murray in 'The Oxford History of the Classical World' J.Boardman, J.Griffin, O.Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 194 In the parabasis proper, the Chorus praises the poet as the saviour of Athens. These jokes at his own expense are best understood in the context of his real-life quarrel with Cleon to whom he remains defiant in spite of his self-mockery. *Possible interpolated lines: Lamachus is another victim of the play's humour but one of the jokes appears not to be by the author. There are eight lines (1181‚Äì88) that some editors omit from their translations of the playAristophanes:Lysistrata, the Acharnians, The Clouds A.Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 244 in which Lamachus is described melodramatically commenting on his own death in a ditch. Lamachus died in the Sicilian Expedition when caught by the enemy on the wrong side of a ditch, many years after the play was produced.

He was an Anglo-Norman aristocrat, possessing large holdings in both England and through his marriage in France. He was the third son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel de Bell√™me. The appellation \\"the Poitevin\\" was for his marriage to an heiress from Poitou. Roger acquired a great lordship in England, with lands in Salfordshire, Essex, Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Hampshire and North Yorkshire.Roger of Poitou is associated with 632 places after the Conquest Open Domesday, The first free online copy of Domesday Book Accessed March 2012 The principal part of the Lordship was in what was then called inter Mersam et Ripam, that is, \\"between the Mersey and the Ribble\\" and is now divided between Lancashire, Merseyside, and Greater Manchester. After 1090, he also assumed the title 1st Lord of Bowland. Before 1086, he had married Almodis, daughter of Count Aldebert II of La Marche in Poitou, and sister and presumptive heiress of count Boso III who was childless and unmarried. Roger's lordship extends beyond the Ribble as far as Cumberland Around 1091, Roger's brother-in-law Boso died, but Roger was apparently preoccupied with Norman and English affairs, and his wife's uncle Odo became count of La Marche. In 1092 Roger acquired a large part of what is now north Lancashire. These grants gave Roger effective control of all the lands north of the River Ribble to the River Lune, which formed a natural border between the secure Norman lands in England and the strongly contested Scottish frontier lands in Cumberland. Due to long established lines of communication across Morecambe Bay, Roger also assumed authority over the regions of Furness and Cartmel; these remained a part of Lancashire until as recently as 1974. The expansion of Roger's lands followed his support of King William II Rufus's invasion of Cumbria in AD1092, where Dolfin of Carlisle ruled, possibly as a vassal of Scottish King Malcolm Canmore. Dolfin was driven out and the Anglo-Scottish border was established north of Carlisle. Roger also acquired the great honour of Eye centered in Suffolk. 1088 and after In 1088, he led a military force with Alan Rufus and Odo of Champagne, against William de St-Calais, bishop of Durham, at the request of William Rufus when the bishop was implicated in a revolt against the king; Roger also negotiated with the bishop on the king's behalf before the bishop went to trial. Roger's father Roger de Montgomery died in 1094. In 1094 Rufus sent Roger to hold the castle at Argentan in Normandy, but Roger surrendered it to Philip I of France on the first day of the siege; Roger and his men were held for ransom and purchased their freedom. Though Philip I was an ally of Curthose, it is thought that this action was less a betrayal of Rufus and more a result of Roger's dual vassalage between the King of England and the King of France. Roger did not lose his English lands as a result of this action but held no position in Rufus' government from this point. Roger continued to be loyal to Rufus but in 1102 joined his brothers' failed rebellion against Henry I of England in favor of Robert Curthose. As a result Roger de Poitou lost his English holdings. The King put those in Craven into the governance of Robert de Romille. Roger then went to his wife's holdings in Poitou. Almodis's uncle Odo was ousted as count of La Marche in 1104, and subsequently the sons of Roger and Almodis are styled as count. In 1109, Roger was permitted to briefly return to England to the court of Henry I, though he did not recover his earlier English holdings. After ca. 1109, Roger appears to have either lost interest in governing in La Marche, or lost the political power itself as he is only seen once in the documents of La Marche as his wife and sons held the authority in the region.

The complexity of a problem is then measured as a function of those parameters. This allows the classification of NP-hard problems on a finer scale than in the classical setting, where the complexity of a problem is only measured as a function of the number of bits in the input. The first systematic work on parameterized complexity was done by . Under the assumption that P ‚â† NP, there exist many natural problems that require superpolynomial running time when complexity is measured in terms of the input size only, but that are computable in a time that is polynomial in the input size and exponential or worse in a parameter . Hence, if is fixed at a small value and the growth of the function over is relatively small then such problems can still be considered \\"tractable\\" despite their traditional classification as \\"intractable\\". The existence of efficient, exact, and deterministic solving algorithms for NP-complete, or otherwise NP-hard, problems is considered unlikely, if input parameters are not fixed; all known solving algorithms for these problems require time that is exponential (or at least superpolynomial) in the total size of the input. However, some problems can be solved by algorithms that are exponential only in the size of a fixed parameter while polynomial in the size of the input. Such an algorithm is called a fixed- parameter tractable (fpt-)algorithm, because the problem can be solved efficiently for small values of the fixed parameter. Problems in which some parameter is fixed are called parameterized problems. A parameterized problem that allows for such an fpt-algorithm is said to be a fixed-parameter tractable problem and belongs to the class , and the early name of the theory of parameterized complexity was fixed-parameter tractability. Many problems have the following form: given an object and a nonnegative integer , does have some property that depends on ? For instance, for the vertex cover problem, the parameter can be the number of vertices in the cover. In many applications, for example when modelling error correction, one can assume the parameter to be \\"small\\" compared to the total input size. Then it is challenging to find an algorithm which is exponential only in , and not in the input size. In this way, parameterized complexity can be seen as two- dimensional complexity theory. This concept is formalized as follows: :A parameterized problem is a language L \\\\subseteq \\\\Sigma^* \\\\times \\\\N, where \\\\Sigma is a finite alphabet. The second component is called the parameter of the problem. :A parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable if the question \\"(x, k) \\\\in L?\\" can be decided in running time f(k) \\\\cdot x^{O(1)}, where is an arbitrary function depending only on . The corresponding complexity class is called FPT. For example, there is an algorithm which solves the vertex cover problem in O(kn + 1.274^k) time, where is the number of vertices and is the size of the vertex cover. This means that vertex cover is fixed-parameter tractable with the size of the solution as the parameter.  Complexity classes  = FPT = FPT contains the fixed parameter tractable problems, which are those that can be solved in time f(k) \\\\cdot {x}^{O(1)} for some computable function . Typically, this function is thought of as single exponential, such as 2^{O(k)} but the definition admits functions that grow even faster. This is essential for a large part of the early history of this class. The crucial part of the definition is to exclude functions of the form f(n,k), such as n^k. The class FPL (fixed parameter linear) is the class of problems solvable in time f(k) \\\\cdot x for some computable function . FPL is thus a subclass of FPT. An example is the satisfiability problem, parameterised by the number of variables. A given formula of size with variables can be checked by brute force in time O(2^km). A vertex cover of size in a graph of order can be found in time O(2^kn), so this problem is also in FPT. An example of a problem that is thought not to be in FPT is graph coloring parameterised by the number of colors. It is known that 3-coloring is NP-hard, and an algorithm for graph -colouring in time f(k)n^{O(1)} for k=3 would run in polynomial time in the size of the input. Thus, if graph coloring parameterised by the number of colors were in FPT, then P = NP. There are a number of alternative definitions of FPT. For example, the running time requirement can be replaced by f(k) + x^{O(1)}. Also, a parameterised problem is in FPT if it has a so-called kernel. Kernelization is a preprocessing technique that reduces the original instance to its \\"hard kernel\\", a possibly much smaller instance that is equivalent to the original instance but has a size that is bounded by a function in the parameter. FPT is closed under a parameterised reduction called fpt-reduction, which simultaneously preserves the instance size and the parameter. Obviously, FPT contains all polynomial-time computable problems. Moreover, it contains all optimisation problems in NP that allow an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). = W hierarchy = The W hierarchy is a collection of computational complexity classes. A parameterized problem is in the class W[i], if every instance (x, k) can be transformed (in fpt-time) to a combinatorial circuit that has weft at most i, such that (x, k)\\\\in L if and only if there is a satisfying assignment to the inputs that assigns 1 to exactly k inputs. The weft is the largest number of logical units with unbounded fan-in on any path from an input to the output. The total number of logical units on the paths (known as depth) must be limited by a constant that holds for all instances of the problem. Note that \\\\mathsf{FPT} = W[0] and W[i] \\\\subseteq W[j] for all i\\\\le j. The classes in the W hierarchy are also closed under fpt-reduction. Many natural computational problems occupy the lower levels, W[1] and W[2].  W[1]  Examples of W[1]-complete problems include * deciding if a given graph contains a clique of size k * deciding if a given graph contains an independent set of size k * deciding if a given nondeterministic single-tape Turing machine accepts within k steps (\\"short Turing machine acceptance\\" problem). This also applies to nondeterministic Turing machines with f(k) tapes and even f(k) of f(k)-dimensional tapes, but even with this extension, the restriction to f(k) tape alphabet size is fixed- parameter tractable. Crucially, the branching of the Turing machine at each step is allowed to depend on n, the size of the input. In this way, the Turing machine may explore nO(k) computation paths.  W[2]  Examples of W[2]-complete problems include * deciding if a given graph contains a dominating set of size k * deciding if a given nondeterministic multi-tape Turing machine accepts within k steps (\\"short multi-tape Turing machine acceptance\\" problem). Crucially, the branching is allowed to depend on n (like the W[1] variant), as is the number of tapes. An alternate W[2]-complete formulation allows only single-tape Turing machines, but the alphabet size may depend on n.  W[t]  W[t] can be defined using the family of Weighted Weft--Depth- SAT problems for d\\\\geq t: W[t,d] is the class of parameterized problems that fpt-reduce to this problem, and W[t] = \\\\bigcup_{d\\\\geq t} W[t,d]. Here, Weighted Weft--Depth- SAT is the following problem: * Input: A Boolean formula of depth at most and weft at most , and a number . The depth is the maximal number of gates on any path from the root to a leaf, and the weft is the maximal number of gates of fan-in at least three on any path from the root to a leaf. * Question: Does the formula have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight exactly ? It can be shown that the problem Weighted -Normalize SAT is complete for W[t] under fpt-reductions. Here, Weighted -Normalize SAT is the following problem: * Input: A Boolean formula of depth at most with an AND-gate on top, and a number . * Question: Does the formula have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight exactly ?  W[P]  W[P] is the class of problems that can be decided by a nondeterministic h(k) \\\\cdot {x}^{O(1)}-time Turing machine that makes at most O(f(k)\\\\cdot \\\\log n) nondeterministic choices in the computation on (x,k) (a k-restricted Turing machine). It is known that FPT is contained in W[P], and the inclusion is believed to be strict. However, resolving this issue would imply a solution to the P versus NP problem. Other connections to unparameterised computational complexity are that FPT equals W[P] if and only if circuit satisfiability can be decided in time \\\\exp(o(n))m^{O(1)}, or if and only if there is a computable, nondecreasing, unbounded function f such that all languages recognised by a nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machine using f(n)log n nondeterministic choices are in P. W[P] can be loosely thought of as the class of problems where we have a set S of n items, and we want to find a subset T \\\\subset S of size k such that a certain property holds. We can encode a choice as a list of k integers, stored in binary. Since the highest any of these numbers can be is n, \\\\lceil\\\\log_2 n\\\\rceil bits are needed for each number. Therefore k \\\\cdot \\\\lceil\\\\log_2 n\\\\rceil total bits are needed to encode a choice. Therefore we can select a subset T\\\\subset S with O(k\\\\cdot \\\\log n) nondeterministic choices. = XP = XP is the class of parameterized problems that can be solved in time n^{f(k)} for some computable function . These problems are called slicewise polynomial, in the sense that each \\"slice\\" of fixed k has a polynomial algorithm, although possibly with a different exponent for each k. Compare this with FPT, which merely allows a different constant prefactor for each value of k. XP contains FPT, and it is known that this containment is strict by diagonalization. = para-NP = para-NP is the class of parameterized problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic algorithm in time f(k) \\\\cdot x^{O(1)} for some computable function f. It is known that \\\\text{FPT}=\\\\text{para-NP} if and only if \\\\text{P}=\\\\text{NP}. A problem is para-NP-hard if it is \\\\text{NP}-hard already for a constant value of the parameter. That is, there is a \\"slice\\" of fixed k that is \\\\text{NP}-hard. A parameterized problem that is \\\\text{para-NP}-hard cannot belong to the class \\\\text{XP}, unless \\\\text{P}=\\\\text{NP}. A classic example of a \\\\text{para-NP}-hard parameterized problem is graph coloring, parameterized by the number k of colors, which is already \\\\text{NP}-hard for k=3 (see Graph coloring#Computational complexity). = A hierarchy = The A hierarchy is a collection of computational complexity classes similar to the W hierarchy. However, while the W hierarchy is a hierarchy contained in NP, the A hierarchy more closely mimics the polynomial-time hierarchy from classical complexity. It is known that A[1] = W[1] holds.

Its classification varies, being classified under some breed standards as a breed in its own right, and in others as one of several acceptable variations of the Belgian Shepherd Dog. It is usually listed within breed standards under one or other, or a combination, of these names.  Description  Belgian Shepherd Dog, or Tervuren The Tervuren is a medium sized athletic breed, they typically stand between with bitches being on average shorter than dogs, and usually weigh between . The Tervuren has a double coat with a long haired outer coat and a thick, dense undercoat; they are typically fawn overlaid with black in colour, although grey with black is known, it has a ruff of long hair around the neck and feathering on the legs. The breed has a long, slender head with erect ears and short hair on the face, the muzzle is typically black. History Along with the Groenendael, Laekenois and Malinois, the Tervuren is one of four regional varieties of Belgian Shepherds, it takes its name from the municipality of Tervuren; as with the other varieties, the Tervuren was used for centuries as a herding dog by Belgian shepherds. By the end of the 19th-century all of the Belgian Shepherds were becoming obsolete and were at danger of extinction so in 1891 the Club de Chien Berger Belge was formed with the purpose of saving the type. The same year Professor Adolphe Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary School conducted a field survey of the type who classified them into three of the four varieties known today, his team assembled 117 specimens and began the process of standardising them into the three distinct varieties based primarily on coat type, in 1897 Laekenois was added as a forth variety. The breed suffered greatly during the Second World War and was almost extinct by 1945, but through careful breeding the variety recovered throughout the second half of the 20th-century. Activities Tervuren can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Belgian Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

This had previously been the standard manner of adding new channels to cable television service, but had not previously attracted the type of controversy that was raised by the 1995 channel launch, in part because the 1995 launch entailed a large number of channels which launched concurrently, whereas previous additions had only involved one or two channels at a time.

Eldest daughter of King Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma, she was married in May 1785 aged 10 with Infante John, Lord of the Infantado and Duke of Beja, second son of Queen Maria I of Portugal, in an attempt to cement ties between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. Detested by the Portuguese court ‚Äî where she was called \\"the Shrew of Queluz\\" () ‚Äî Carlota Joaquina also gradually won the antipathy of the people, who accused her of promiscuity and influencing her husband in favor of the interests of the Spanish crown. After the escape of the Portuguese court to Brazil, Carlota Joaquina began conspiring against her husband, claiming that he had no mental capacity to govern Portugal and its possessions, thus wanting to establish a regency. Ambitious, she also planned to usurp the Spanish crown that was in the hands of Napoleon's brother Joseph Bonaparte. After the marriage in 1817 of her son Pedro with the Archduchess Leopoldina of Austria and the later return of the royal family to Portugal in 1821, Carlota Joaquina was confined in the Royal Palace of Queluz, where she died alone and abandoned by her children on 7 January 1830. After her death, Carlota Joaquina (mainly in Brazil) became part of popular culture and an important historical figure, being the subject of several books, films and other media. Some scholars believe that she has had a rough and superficial behavior, attributing to her the fact that she hated Brazil. Life =Childhood= Infanta Carlota Joaquina, by Anton Raphael Mengs, ca. 1775-76. Born in the Royal Palace of Aranjuez on 25 April 1775 as the second (but eldest surviving) child of Charles, Prince of Asturias, and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma, she was baptized with the names of Carlota Joaquina Teresa Cayetana, but she was called only by her first name, Carlota, a name that honoured both her father and paternal grandfather, King Charles III of Spain ‚Äîof whom Carlota was his favourite granddaughter‚Äî. Despite the rigidity of her education and court etiquette, the Infanta was described as mischievous and playful. She received a rigid and deeply Catholic education, with bases in the fields of study of religion, geography, painting and riding (Carlota's favorite sport). The closed and austere temperament of the Spanish monarchy imposed on the family and on the whole court rigid norms of behavior and etiquette. King Charles III, a man of reserved behaviour, devoted more time to his family than to the animations of the courtesan life, where his daughter-in-law Maria Luisa took an active part. Carlota's mother soon assumed the organization of entertainments at court, with luxurious parties, where morals were easily forgotten. Soon the Princess of Asturias' image would be linked to that of a promiscuous woman who betrayed her husband to other men. Among them, possibly, was the Prime Minister Manuel Godoy, whose alleged love affair was widely explored by the press at the time. Not even the successive pregnancies and long-hoped birth of a living male heir to the throne in 1784 saved Maria Lu√≠sa from the contempt of the population. She would go down in history as one of the most unpopular queens in Spain and her bad reputation deeply affected her children, especially Carlota, the firstborn daughter. =Marriage= Infanta Carlota Joaquina at the time of her betrothal, by Mariano Salvador Maella, 1785. The subject of Carlota Joaquina's marriage was arranged by both King Charles III and his sister Mariana Victoria, Dowager Queen of Portugal, in the late 1770s when Mariana went to Spain to encourage diplomatic relations between the estranged countries. Carlota Joaquina was to marry Infante John, Duke of Beja (youngest grandson of Mariana Victoria), and Infante Gabriel of Spain (Carlota Joaquina's paternal uncle) was to marry Infanta Mariana Vit√≥ria of Portugal (only surviving granddaughter and namesake of the Dowager Queen of Portugal). Carlota's apprenticeship would be tested when she underwent a series of public examinations in front of the Spanish court and Portuguese ambassadors sent on behalf of Queen Maria I of Portugal to evaluate the qualities of the princess destined to marry her second son. In October 1785, the Gazeta of Lisbon published an account of the tests: Having proven the talent of the bride, there was therefore no impediment to the union with the Portuguese prince, so in 8 May 1785 was celebrated the proxy marriage; three days later, on 11 May, the 10-year-old Carlota Joaquina and her retinue left Spain for Lisbon. On the day she left the Spanish court, Carlota Joaquina asked her mother to make a painting of her in a red dress to place on the wall, instead of the painting of Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain (which Carlota Joaquina claimed to be more beautiful). As a part of the infanta cortege were Father Felipe Scio, famous Spanish theologian and scholar, Em√≠lia O'Dempsy, as lady-in-waiting, and Anna Miquelina, personal maid of Carlota Joaquina. The official wedding ceremony between Infante John of Portugal and Carlota Joaquina took place on 9 June 1785; she was only 10 years old while her husband was 18. Due to the bride's young age, the consummation of the union was delayed until 9 January 1790, when Carlota Joaquina was then able to conceive and bear children. =Life in the Portuguese court= Carlota Joaquina, Duchess of Beja, by Giuseppe Troni, 1787. Nevertheless, the climate in the Braganza court differed in many respects from that of the cheerful Spanish court. While in other parts of the Europe they represented the mark of a new society based on the Age of Enlightenment principles, in Portugal the Catholic Church imposes norms prohibiting all types of amusement. The dramatization of comedies was banned, including the performance of dances and parties. The reign of Queen Maria I was marked by the rise of a conservative group of the nobility and clergy of Portugal; an extremely \\"boredom\\" environment, as defined by Dowager Queen Mariana Victoria (Carlota Joaquina's great-aunt). In this way, Carlota Joaquina found herself in the midst of a very religious and austere environment, in contrast to the extravagance and the faust to which she was accustomed. Despite this, her relationship with her mother-in-law was very tender, as the letters exchanged between them proved. The joy and vivacity of Carlota were responsible for the rare hours of relaxation of the Queen. Her more liberal habits and customs differed in many ways from that of other women at court. Quite traditional in relation to female behavior, Portuguese men disapproved of the ease with which Carlota Joaquina transited in public space, her performance in the political field and her distemper in the family routine. Since most Portuguese women were deprived of social life, Carlota Joaquina's offending behavior allowed some malicious rumors about her in the court. Some of them were prejudiced, like the Duchess of Abrant√®s, wife of the French General Junot, who later invaded Portugal. During her time in Lisbon, Madame Junot had ridiculed Carlota Joaquina both for her manner of acting and for her dressing, and she had slain her as an extremely ugly woman. =Princess of Brazil= Ajuda Palace. In 1788, when his eldest brother Joseph, Prince of Brazil died, Infante John became the first in line to his mother's throne. Soon he received the titles Prince of Brazil and 15th Duke of Braganza. Between 1788 and 1816, Carlota Joaquina was known as Princess of Brazil as the wife of the heir of the Portuguese throne. Carlota Joaquina's husband was good-natured, indolent, corpulent and almost as ugly as she was. His religious observances bored her, and they were quite incompatible. Nevertheless, she gave birth to nine children during their marriage and, because they were all handsome, it was rumoured that especially the younger ones had a different father. After Queen Maria I became insane in 1792, Prince John took over the government in her name, even though he only took the title of Prince Regent in 1799. This change in events suited Carlota Joaquina's ambitious and sometimes violent nature. In the Portuguese court she would interfere frequently in matters of state, trying to influence the decisions of her husband; this attempts to meddling in politics displeased the Portuguese nobility and even the population. Because she was excluded from the government decisions many times, Carlota Joaquina organized a plot with the intention to take the reins of power from the Prince Regent, arresting him and declaring that he was incapable of rule like his mother. However, in 1805 this plot was discovered; the Count of Vila Verde proposed the opening of an investigation and the arrest of all those involved, but Carlota Joaquina was saved because her husband, wishing to avoid a public scandal, opposed to her arrest, preferring to confine his wife to Queluz Palace and Ramalh√£o Palace, while he himself moved to Mafra Palace, effectively separating from her. At that time Carlota Joaquina's enemies claimed that she had bought a retreat where she indulged in sexual orgies.  In Brazil  In 1807, the Portuguese royal family left Portugal for Brazil because of the Napoleonic invasion. While in Brazil, Carlota Joaquina made attempts to obtain the administration of the Spanish dominions in Hispanic America, a project known as Carlotism. Spain itself was controlled by Napoleon and its kings, her father and brother Ferdinand, were held by Napoleon in France. Carlota Joaquina regarded herself as the heiress of her captured family. Allegedly among her plans was to send armies to occupy Buenos Aires and northern Argentina to style herself \\"Queen of La Plata\\". The Portuguese-Brazilian forces, however, only managed to annex the eastern banks of the Rio de la Plata as Cisplatina, which were kept in the Empire of Brazil after 1822 and seceded in 1828 as the Republic of Uruguay.  Queen  Queen Carlota Joaquina equestrian portrait in display at the Imperial Museum of Brazil When the Portuguese royal family returned to Portugal in 1821 after an absence of 14 years, Carlota Joaquina met a country that had changed much since their departure. In 1807, Portugal had lived stably under absolutism. Napoleonic troops and political attitudes fostered by Spain's Cortes of C√°diz had brought revolutionary ideas to Portugal. In 1820, a liberal revolution commenced in Oporto. A constitutional Cortes Gerais had been promulgated, and in 1821 it gave Portugal its first constitution. The queen had arch-conservative positions and wanted a reactionary response in Portugal. Her husband, however, did not want to renege on his vows to uphold the constitution. Carlota Joaquina made an alliance with her youngest son Miguel, who shared his mother's conservative views. In 1824, using Miguel's position as army commander, they took power and held the king a virtual prisoner in the palace, where the queen tried to make him abdicate in favor of Miguel. The king received British help against his wife and son and regained power, finally compelling his son to leave the country. The queen had also to go briefly into exile. King John VI lived in Bemposta Palace and Queen Carlota Joaquina in Queluz. Though she lived there quietly, she became decidedly eccentric in dress and behaviour. However, their eldest son Pedro, left behind as regent in Brazil, was proclaimed and crowned on 1 December 1822 as its independent Emperor. John VI refused to accept this until he was persuaded by the British to do so, signing in August 1825 the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro by which he and Carlota Joaquina were granted the honorific title of Emperors of Brasil.Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825) He died in March 1826. Claiming ill- health, Carlota Joaquina refused to visit his deathbed and started the rumour that her husband had been poisoned by the Freemasons. Pedro, Emperor of Brazil, now became King of Portugal as well, but knowing that carrying out the duties of both positions would be impossible, Pedro abdicated in Portugal and made his eldest daughter Maria the Queen of Portugal as well as betrothing her to Miguel, his younger brother. In the meantime, Carlota Joaquina's daughter, the Infanta Isabel Maria was to be Regent in Portugal instead of Carlota Joaquina, who ordinarily would have held such a post as Queen Dowager. About two years later the little queen set out for Portugal, only to find upon arrival at Gibraltar that her uncle and fianc√© had not only removed the regent, but declared himself King of Portugal. Queen Carlota Joaquina died at the Queluz Royal Palace, outside of Sintra. It is speculated whether she died because of natural causes or whether she, in fact, killed herself.

It is a midrash comprising a collection of ancient rabbinical homiletical interpretations of the Book of Genesis (B'reshith in Hebrew). It is expository midrash to the first book of the Torah, assigned by tradition to the amora Hoshaiah (or Osha'yah), who flourished in the third century in Roman Syria Palaestina. The midrash forms an aggadic commentary on Genesis, in keeping with the midrashic exegesis of that age. In a continuous sequence, broken only toward the end, the Biblical text is expounded, verse for verse, often word for word. Only genealogic passages and passages that furnish no material for exposition (as the reiterated account of Abraham's servant in ) are omitted. Simplicity Genesis Rabbah contains many simple explanations of words and sentences, often in the Aramaic language, suitable for the instruction of youth. It also contains varied aggadic expositions popular in the public lectures of the synagogues and schools. The editor of the midrash has strung together various longer or shorter explanations and aggadic interpretations of the successive passages, sometimes anonymously, sometimes citing the author. The editor adds to the running commentary longer aggadic disquisitions or narratives, connected in some way with the verse in question, or with one of the explanations of it ‚Äî a method not unusual in the Talmud and in other midrashim. The first chapters of Genesis, on the creation of the world and of man, furnished especially rich material for this mode of exegesis. Whole sections are devoted to comments on one or two verses of the text. Many references to contemporary philosophical thought are made with the purpose of refuting the opinions of nonbelievers. References to contemporaneous conditions and historical events also occur. It is characteristic of the midrash to view the personages and conditions of the Bible in the light of the contemporary history of the time. Though the stories embraced in Genesis furnished little occasion for comments on legal topics, Genesis Rabbah contains a few short legal (or halakic) sentences and quotations taken from the Mishnah and other sources. This midrash is rich in sublime thoughts and finely worded sentences, in parables, and in foreign words, especially Greek. Form This extensive and important midrash, which forms a complete commentary on Genesis, and exemplifies all points of midrashic exegesis, is divided into sections. Prefaces head these sections. It is by these means distinguished from the tannaitic midrashim to the other books of the Torah, such as Mekilta, Sifra, and Sifre. Every chapter of the Genesis Rabbah is headed by the first verse of the passage to be explained, and is introduced, with few exceptions, by one or more prefatory remarks starting from a verse taken from another Biblical passage as text ‚Äî generally from the Writings or Ketuvim. By various explanations of these texts, a transition is effected to the exposition of the particular verse of Genesis heading the section. There are in the Genesis Rabbah about 230 of these passages. About 70 are cited with the name of the Rabbi with whom they originated or whose explanation of the verse in question was used as an introduction to the section of Genesis Rabbah. Introductory passages Most of these passages are anonymous and may perhaps be ascribed in part to the author of Genesis Rabbah. They begin with the verse of the text, which often stands at the head of the proem without any formula of introduction. The structure of the prefatory passages varies. In some, only the introductory text is given, its application to the verse of Genesis to be expounded being self-evident or being left to a later working out. The single prefaces, of which there is a large number, contain explanations of their text which refer entirely or in its last part to the verse or passage of Genesis to be expounded in that section. The composite introductions consist of different expositions of the same Biblical verse, by different aggadists, strung together in various ways, but always arranged so that the last exposition ‚Äî the last link of the introduction ‚Äî leads to the exposition of the passage of Genesis, with the first verse of which the introductions often close. For these introductions, which are often quite lengthy, the material for the several expositions was ready at hand. The original work on these passages consisted principally in the combining and grouping of the several sentences and expositions into a coordinate whole, arranged so that the last member forms the actual introduction to the exposition of the section. Definitely characterized as they are in their beginning by these introductions, the sections of Genesis Rabbah have no formal ending, although several show a transition to the Biblical passage that is expounded in the following section. The principle of division In the manuscripts, as well as in the editions, the sections are consecutively numbered. Many quotations in the Shulchan Aruch mention the passage of Genesis Rabbah by the number of the section. The total number of the sections, both in the manuscripts and in the editions, varies from 97 to 101. Nearly all the manuscripts and editions agree in counting 96 chapters. The principle of division followed in the sections of Genesis Rabbah was evidently that of the Biblical text itself as fixed at the time of the compilation of this midrash, in accordance with the open and closed paragraphs (◊§◊™◊ï◊ó◊ï◊™ and ◊°◊™◊ï◊û◊ï◊™) in the Hebrew text of Genesis. There are separate sections in the midrash for almost all these sections as they are still found in Genesis, with the exception of the genealogical passages. But there are sections that bear evidences of relation to the Torah portions (\\"sedarim\\") of the Palestinian triennial cycle, and a careful investigation of these may lead to the discovery of an arrangement of sedarim different from that heretofore known from old registers. However, there are sections, especially in the beginning of the midrash, in which only one or a few verses at a time are expounded. The Torah portions of the customary one-year cycle are not regarded at all in the divisions of Genesis Rabba, neither are they marked in the best manuscripts or in the editio princeps of the midrash; the sections, therefore, can not be regarded as mere subdivisions of the sedarim, as which they appear in later editions of this midrash. Material Far more difficult than any question concerning the outward form of Genesis Rabbah is that of deciding how much of its present contents is original material included in it, and how much of later addition. The sections formed the framework that was to contain the exposition of a number of Biblical verses in continuous succession. But with the notoriously loose construction of the aggadic exegesis it became easy to string together, on every verse or part of a verse, a number of rambling comments; or to add longer or shorter aggadic passages, stories, etc., connected in some way with the exposition of the text. This process of accretion took place quite spontaneously in Genesis Rabba, as in the other works of the Talmudic and midrashic literature. Between the beginning and the completion of these works ‚Äî if ever they were completed ‚Äî a long period elapsed during which there was much addition and collection. The tradition that Rabbi Hosha'iah is the author of Genesis Rabbah may be taken to mean that he began the work, in the form of the running commentary customary in tannaitic times, arranging the exposition on Genesis according to the sequence of the verses, and furnishing the necessary complement to the tannaitic midrashim on the other books of the Torah. The ascription of the Mekilta to Rabbi Ishmael and of the Jerusalem Talmud to Rabbi Johanan rests on a similar procedure. Perhaps the comments on Genesis were originally divided into sections that corresponded with the above-mentioned sections of the text, and that contained the beginnings of the simplest introductions, as the first traces of such introductions are found also in the tannaitic midrash. But the embellishment of the sections with numerous artistic introductions ‚Äî which points to a combination of the form of the running commentary with the form of the finished homilies following the type of the Pesikta and Tanhuma Midrashim ‚Äî was the result of the editing of Genesis Rabbah that is now extant, when the material found in collections and traditions of the aggadic exegesis of the period of the Amoraim was taken up in the midrash, and Genesis Rabbah was given its present form, if not its present bulk. Perhaps the editor made use also of different collections on the several parts of Genesis. The present Genesis Rabbah shows a singular disproportion between the length of the first Torah portion and that of the eleven others. The Torah portion Bereishit alone comprises 29 sections, being more than one-fourth of the whole work. It is possible that the present Genesis Rabbah is a combination of two midrashim of unequal proportions, and that the 29 sections of the first Torah portion ‚Äî several of which expound only one or a few verses ‚Äî constitute the extant or incomplete material of a Genesis Rabbah that was laid out on a much larger and more comprehensive scale than the midrash to the other Torah portions. Origin of name The work may have received its name, \\"Genesis Rabbah,\\" from that larger midrash at the beginning of Genesis, unless that designation was originally used to distinguish this midrash from the shorter and older one, which was ascribed to Rabbi Hoshayah. The opinion that the name of the midrash finds its explanation in the first words, \\"Rabbi Hosha'yah rabbah began . . . \\" as if the word \\"rabbah\\" belonged originally to the name of the amora, and that the name of the work, \\"Genesis Rabba,\\" is an abbreviation of \\"Bereshit derabbi Hoshayah rabbah,\\" is untenable for the reason that in the best manuscripts ‚Äî and in a very old quotation ‚Äî the name \\"Rabbi Hoshayah\\" stands without the addition \\"rabbah\\" in the first preface at the beginning of the midrash. It would be singular if the authorial designation had been lost and yet the attribute had remained in the title of the midrash. Date It is difficult to ascertain the exact date of the editing of Genesis Rabbah. It was probably undertaken not much later than the Jerusalem Talmud (4th to 5th centuries). But even then the text was probably not finally closed, for longer or shorter passages could always be added, the number of prefatory passages to a section be increased, and those existing be enlarged by accretion. Thus, beginning with the Torah portion Vayishlach, extensive passages are found that bear the marks of the later aggadah, and have points of connection with the Tanhuma homilies. The passages were probably added at an early date, since they are not entirely missing in the older manuscripts, which are free from many other additions and glosses that are found in the present editions. In the concluding chapters, Genesis Rabbah seems to have remained defective. In the sections of the Torah portion Vayigash, the comment is no longer carried out verse by verse; the last section of this Torah portion, as well as the first of the Torah portion Vayechi, is probably drawn from Tanhuma homilies. The comment to the whole 48th chapter of Genesis is missing in all the manuscripts (with one exception), and to verses 1-14 in the editions. The remaining portion of this Torah portion, the comment on Jacob's blessing () is found in all the manuscripts ‚Äî with the above-mentioned exceptions ‚Äî in a revision showing later additions, a revision that was also used by the compiler of the Tanhuma Midrash edited by Solomon Buber. The best manuscript of Genesis Rabbah is found in the Codex Add. 27,169 of the British Museum. It was used for the critical edition issued by J. Theodor. Print editions *Midrash Rabbah: Genesis.

It was created by Jay Tarses and stars Blair Brown in the title role. Premise The show depicts the life of Molly Bickford Dodd, a divorced woman in New York City with a lifestyle that could be described as both yuppie and bohemian. Molly seems to drift from job to job and relationship to relationship. Her ex-husband, a ne'er-do-well jazz musician, still cares for her.

Episodes =Season 1 (1987)= =Season 2 (1988‚Äì89)= =Season 3 (1989)= =Season 4 (1990)= =Season 5 (1991)= Production The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd had story lines that often did not resolve in a single episode. The show was filmed using a single camera. Production took place in Hollywood for the first two seasons before moving to Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York in season 3. Tarses wrote and directed many of its episodes (and made a number of cameo appearances). Reception and network change NBC first broadcast the show as a summer replacement in 1987 running 13 episodes. Molly Dodd was critically acclaimed and a moderate ratings success (it was featured in the network's then-powerhouse Thursday night lineup), but was not featured in the network's fall schedule. It was a mid-season replacement for NBC again in spring 1988, with 12 episodes (a season-ending 13th episode was produced but not aired). NBC canceled Molly Dodd after this second short season. After it was canceled by NBC, Lifetime cable network picked the show up, first re- airing the 26 episodes originally produced, then commissioning three more 13-episode seasons for 1989, 1990, and 1991. Lifetime would continue to air Molly Dodd in reruns after original production stopped. Awards and nominations The show earned Brown five Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, one for each year the show was on. Tarses was also the recipient of multiple nominations.  Music rights  Despite some demand for the show on DVD or streaming services, the original producers did not clear music rights for subsequent broadcast. Since Brown often sang as Molly, the cost to secure those rights would be substantial. In an interview, Brown indicated \\"all the songs that I sang, they never got the rights. So [the show is] in a vault somewhere and will never see the light of day.\\" References External links The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd at epguides.com *Richard Lawson Official Website: The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd ‚Äì features the video clip of Molly and Nathaniel's first meeting, plus other clips and production stills 1987 American television series debuts 1991 American television series endings 1980s American comedy-drama television series 1990s American comedy-drama television series American television series revived after cancellation English-language television shows Lifetime (TV network) original programming NBC original programming Television series by Warner Bros.

On January 1, 1998; Belmont and Methuen Township amalgamated with the Village of Havelock to form what is now Havelock-Belmont- Methuen. History The region's colonial history began with an influx of settlers after Belmont and Methuen Township was surveyed in 1823. The community of Havelock was incorporated as an independent village in 1892. Havelock was named after the British general, Sir Henry Havelock. Early settlers built their homes in an area of dense forests and numerous lakes and rivers within the rocky Canadian Shield. They survived by means of fishing, logging, and farming. By 1869, Blairton, in the Township of Belmont County, was a village with a population of 500. The village was near the richest iron mines in the Dominion. Miners and laborers were in great demand. The village was a station of the Cobourg, Peterborough & Marmora Railway. The land in the vicinity was almost all taken up. There were stages to Norwood and Marmora.The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869 Later, in the nineteenth century and continuing to the present, mining became an important economic activity. Early businesses in Havelock included a post office, store, bakery, a blacksmith and a millinery and were located south of the current village on high ground at the intersection of County Road 30 and Old Norwood Road. In 1881, the Canadian Pacific Railway surveyed a right-of-way through the area north of Havelock and a year later laid rails and surveyed and filled the swampy land to make room for a larger village. The current village of Havelock was developed on the filled land by the tracks north of the former village site and was incorporated in 1892. In the fall of 1884, the first full passenger train stopped at Havelock, from Toronto on its way to Smith's Falls. Havelock was an important freight depot from the 1880s to the 1960s. The railway is now run by Canadian Pacific as Kawartha Lakes Railway and its activity today consists of transporting nepheline syenite and crushed basalt rock from two mines north of Havelock operated by Unimin. In 1998, the village of Havelock was amalgamated with the township of Belmont-Methuen to form the current township of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen. = Historic School = The old school, a two story building now known as the Hilltop Apartments, stands at the Northwest corner of Oak Street and Mathison Street, Havelock. In 1890 to 1963 Havelock area students attended this school which in 1937 was renamed Havelock High School. In 1952 Havelock High School students were transferred to the new Norwood District High School in the neighbouring town of Norwood, Ontario. In 1963 Havelock Public School students were transferred to the new Havelock Public School, east of the Havelock Community Centre. In 1963 the school building was sold and converted to apartments. In September, 2005 the Havelock High School Reunion Committee placed in front of the apartments a commemorative plaque bolted to a large red granite stone from a local quarry. = Railway Station = The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) station on Ottawa Street (Hwy #7) in Havelock was built in 1929. It was designated in 1991 as a Heritage Railway Station by the Historic Sights and Monuments Board, Parks Canada. In 2004 the Station was purchased and renovated to accommodate restaurants.  Local Government  The town's council includes a Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and three Councillors elected on the basis of one per ward, who is elected to join the mayor at meetings of Peterborough County Council. The members of council elected in 2018 are: Mayor: Jim Martin Deputy Mayor: David Gerow Councillors: * At Large: Hart Webb * Township Ward: Larry Ellis * Village Ward: Barry Pomeroy Communities The township comprises the communities of Ashby Mill, Belmont Lake, Blairton (ghost town), Blairton Station, Blue Mountain, Chase Corners, Cordova Mines, Freeman Corners, Jack Lake, Havelock, Kasshabog Lake, MacDonald Bay, Nephton (ghost town), Oak Lake, Preneveau, Rockdale, Round Lake, Rush Point and Vansickle. Havelock is the site of an annual country music festival, the Havelock Country Jamboree, in August. Havelock Country Jamboree celebrated its 30th Anniversary in the summer of 2019.

The incumbent is independent of the government and answers to the Knesset alone.  Duties  The principal function of the state comptroller is to check on the legality, regularity, efficiency, economy, and ethical conduct of public institutions. The checks are performed by continuous and spot inspections of the financial accounts and activities of all ministries, the armed forces and security services, local government bodies, and any corporations, enterprises, or organizations subsidized or managed by the state in any form. By law, the State Comptroller in Israel also functions as Ombudsman (Hebrew: Netziv Tlunot HaTzibur) to whom members of the public may send complaints about actions by governmental bodies that have caused them harm. The state comptroller's office is divided into five major inspection units. The first four units are concerned, respectively, with ministries, defense services, local authorities, and corporations; the fifth inspection unit deals with public complaints concerning government bodies.  History  State Comptroller of Israel signboard In 1965 the Comptroller's Office hosted V INCOSAI, the fifth triennial convention of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. The state comptroller is elected by the Knesset in a secret ballot for a single term of seven years.Basic Law: The State Comptroller The state comptroller can be relieved only by the Knesset or by resignation or demise. During the incumbent's term of office, he or she may not be a member of the Knesset or otherwise engage in politics and is prohibited from any public or private activity that could create a conflict of interest with the independent performance of the duties of the office. The state comptroller, although lacking in authority to enforce compliance, has broad investigative powers and employs hundreds of staff members, including accountants, lawyers, and other relevant professionals. The state comptroller acts in conjunction with the State Audit Committee of the Knesset and reports to it whenever necessary. The state comptroller may recommend that the State Audit Committee appoint a special commission of inquiry, but having no statutory authority of its own it relies on the Knesset to impose sanctions on errant bodies. The state comptroller's budget is submitted directly to the Finance Committee and is exempt from prior consideration by the Ministry of Finance.

Canadian Government Railways was the legal name used between 1915-1918 for all federal government-owned railways in Canada. The principal component companies were the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (IRC), the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR), the Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR), and the Hudson Bay Railway (HBR). There were also several minor branch railways in the province of New Brunswick that were acquired by CGR during this time. The Ocean Limited run under the CGR. The deepening financial crisis in Canada's railway industry toward the end of the First World War saw the majority of major railways across the country nationalized by the federal government. The CGR played a vital role in Canada's wartime effort, moving vast numbers of troops and supplies. A notable role was the relief and reconstruction in Halifax after the 1917 Halifax Explosion and one CGR employee, Vince Coleman became a celebrated hero in the explosion. The first system to be taken over was the bankrupt Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) on September 6, 1918, whereby the government-appointed Board of Management for CNoR was instructed to take responsibility for all CGR operations as well. Later that year, the federal government created the Canadian National Railways (CNR) as a means to simplify the funding and administration of the nationalized railway system, which was formally brought about by an order issued on December 20, 1918, by the Privy Council. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR) was nationalized after defaulting on loan payments March 7, 1919, and entered the CNR fold on July 12, 1920. GTPR's parent company, the bankrupt Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) was nationalized on May 21, 1920, and was absorbed into the CNR on January 30, 1923. Although the CGR only existed for a short period of time before evolving into the Canadian National Railway, it was a very visible Canadian railway in World War One due to the large scale of wartime railway operation. Large amounts of rolling stock were lettered for the CGR, although in many regions, such as the Maritimes, the public continued to refer to its trains and facilities by their old name of the Intercolonial. The CGR moniker ceased to be used after 1918, but the CGR itself existed on paper until the late 20th century, largely due to real estate leases and other agreements. A Privy Council order dated July 22, 1993, authorized the sale of CGR to the Crown corporation CN for one Canadian dollar.

The play was published in quarto in 1605 by the stationer Nathaniel Butter, and printed by Thomas Creede. In 1664 it was one of the seven plays that publisher Philip Chetwinde added to the second impression of his Third Folio of Shakespeare's plays. The play was not entered into the Stationers' Register, but it is attributed to William Shakespeare on the title page of the only edition. This attribution is widely and generally rejected by scholars. The title page also identifies the play as a King's Men's play. The London Prodigal has been dated as early as c. 1591, and as late as 1603‚Äì04. It is one of a long series of \\"prodigal son\\" plays that reach back as far as the Bible for inspiration and precedent; but it is also an example of the evolving Elizabethian genre of domestic dramas, and \\"one of the first naturalistic dramas in English\\".Willard Thorp, quoted in Logan and Smith, The Popular School, p. 222. Individual scholars have attributed the play to Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker, John Marston, and Michael Drayton;Logan and Smith, The New Intellectuals, p. 92. others have suggested Thomas Heywood and George Wilkins.Logan and Smith, The Popular School, p. 221. None of these attributions, however, has been accepted by a significant proportion of the critical community. Synopsis Matthew Flowerdale, the prodigal son of a merchant, Flowerdale Senior, is a libertine, gambler, swearer, brawler, drinker and thief. Flowerdale Senior's brother, Flowerdale Junior, warns him about Matthew's dissolute behaviour but Flowerdale Senior dismisses his fear, believing that \\"youth must have its course\\" and that his son will soon make amends. In order to spy on his son, Flowerdale Senior feigns death and appears disguised as a servant. He is soon appalled by the sum of his son's vices. Matthew Flowerdale forges a will in which he pretends to be a wealthy man bequeathing all his fortune to Sir Lancelot Spurcock. When the latter discovers the will, he decides to marry his daughter Luce with Matthew. They are quickly married but Matthew is arrested for debt on his wedding day. He becomes poorer and poorer and robs one of Luce's sisters. Although she is abominably treated by her husband (he even asks her to become a whore), Luce remains loyal to him and finally moves her dissolute husband to repentance and reform. Flowerdale Senior reveals his true identity and congratulates his son for his new resolutions. Notes References * C. F.

These manuscripts outline a 1,000-year continuum (870 CE to 19th century) of Jewish Middle-Eastern and North African history and comprise the largest and most diverse collection of medieval manuscripts in the world. The Genizah texts are written in various languages, especially Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic, mainly on vellum and paper, but also on papyrus and cloth. In addition to containing Jewish religious texts such as Biblical, Talmudic and later Rabbinic works (some in the original hands of the authors), the Genizah gives a detailed picture of the economic and cultural life of the North African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, especially during the 10th to 13th centuries. It is now dispersed among a number of libraries, including the libraries of Cambridge University and the University of Manchester. Some additional fragments were found in the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and the collection includes a number of old documents bought in Cairo in the latter nineteenth century.Goitein, Shelomo Dov. A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza. 6 vols. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967‚Äì1993. .  Discovery and present locations  Solomon Schechter at work in Cambridge University Library, 1898 The first European to note the collection was apparently Simon van Gelderen (a great-uncle of Heinrich Heine), who visited the Ben Ezra synagogue and reported about the Cairo Genizah in 1752 or 1753. In 1864 the traveler and scholar Jacob Saphir visited the synagogue and explored the Genizah for two days; while he did not identify any specific item of significance he suggested that possibly valuable items might be in store.Ghosh (1992), p. 83. In 1896, the Scottish scholars and twin sisters Agnes S. Lewis and Margaret D. Gibson returned from Egypt with fragments from the Genizah they considered to be of interest, and showed them to Solomon Schechter \\"their irrepressibly curious rabbinical friend\\" at Cambridge. Schechter, already aware of the Genizah but not of its significance, immediately recognized the importance of the material. With the financial assistance of his Cambridge colleague and friend Charles Taylor, Schechter made an expedition to Egypt, where, with the assistance of the Chief Rabbi, he sorted and removed the greater part of the contents of the Genizah chamber.Ghosh (1992), pp. 88ff. Agnes and Margaret joined him there en route to Sinai (their fourth visit in five years) and he showed them the chamber which Agnes reported was \\"simply indescribable\\".Soskice (2009) pp. 230, 232 The Genizah fragments have now been archived in various libraries around the world. The Taylor-Schechter collection at Cambridge is the largest, by far, single collection, with nearly 193,000 fragments (137,000 shelf-marks). There are a further 31,000 fragments at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The John Rylands University Library in Manchester holds a collection of over 11,000 fragments, which are currently being digitised and uploaded to an online archive. The Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford has a collection of 25,000 Genizah folios. Westminster College in Cambridge held 1,700 fragments, which were deposited by Lewis and Gibson in 1896. In 2013 the two Oxbridge libraries, the Bodleian Library at Oxford and Cambridge University Library, joined together to raise funds to buy the Westminster collection after it was put up for sale for ¬£1.2 million. This is the first time the two libraries have collaborated for such a fundraising effort.  Contents and significance  Many of the fragments found in the Cairo Genizah may be dated to the early centuries of the second millennium CE, and there are a fair number of earlier items as well as a number of nineteenth-century pieces. The manuscripts in the Genizah include sacred and religious materials as well as great deal of secular writings. The Genizah materials include a wide range of content. Among the literary fragments, the most popular categories are liturgical texts, Biblical and related texts, and Rabbinic literature. There are also materials with philosophical, scientific, mystical, and linguistic writings. Among the non- literary items there are legal documents and private letters. Also found was school exercises and merchants' account books, as well as communal records of various sorts. The normal practice for genizot (pl. of genizah) was to remove the contents periodically and bury them in a cemetery. Many of these documents were written in the Aramaic language using the Hebrew alphabet. As the Jews considered Hebrew to be the language of God, and the Hebrew script to be the literal writing of God, the texts could not be destroyed even long after they had served their purpose. The Jews who wrote the materials in the Genizah were familiar with the culture and language of their contemporary society. The documents are invaluable as evidence for how colloquial Arabic of this period was spoken and understood. They also demonstrate that the Jewish creators of the documents were part of their contemporary society: they practiced the same trades as their Muslim and Christian neighbors, including farming; they bought, sold, and rented properties. The importance of these materials for reconstructing the social and economic history for the period between 950 and 1250 cannot be overemphasized. Judaic scholar Shelomo Dov Goitein created an index for this time period which covers about 35,000 individuals. This included about 350 \\"prominent people,\\" among them Maimonides and his son Abraham, 200 \\"better known families\\", and mentions of 450 professions and 450 goods. He identified material from Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria (but not Damascus or Aleppo), Tunisia, Sicily, and even covering trade with India. Cities mentioned range from Samarkand in Central Asia to Seville and Sijilmasa, Morocco to the west; from Aden north to Constantinople; Europe not only is represented by the Mediterranean port cities of Narbonne, Marseilles, Genoa and Venice, but even Kiev and Rouen are occasionally mentioned.Goitein. A Mediterranean Society, vol. 1, p. 23. In particular the various records of payments to labourers for building maintenance and the like form by far the largest collection of records of day wages in the Islamic world for the early medieval period, despite difficulties in interpreting the currency units cited and other aspects of the data. They have invariably been cited in discussions of the medieval Islamic economy since the 1930s, when this aspect of the collection was researched, mostly by French scholars. The Ben Ezra Synagogue Many of the items in Cairo Genizah are not a complete manuscript, but are instead a fragment of one or two leaves, many of which are damaged themselves. Similarly, the pages of a single manuscript often became separated. It is not uncommon to find the pages of one manuscript housed in three or four different modern libraries. On the other hand, non-literary writings often lost their value with the passage of time, and were left in the Genizah while still more or less intact. The materials include a vast number of books, most of them fragments, which are estimated to number nearly 280,000 leaves, including parts of Jewish religious writings and fragments from the Quran. Of particular interest to biblical scholars are several incomplete manuscripts of Sirach. The non-literary materials, which include court documents, legal writings, and the correspondence of the local Jewish community (such as the Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon), are somewhat smaller, but still impressive: Goitein estimated their size at \\"about 10,000 items of some length, of which 7,000 are self-contained units large enough to be regarded as documents of historical value. Only half of these are preserved more or less completely.\\"Goitein. A Mediterranean Society, vol. 1, p. 13 The number of documents added to the Genizah changed throughout the years. For example, the number of documents added were fewer between 1266 and circa 1500, when most of the Jewish community had moved north to the city of Cairo proper, and saw a rise around 1500 when the local community was increased by refugees from Spain. It was they who brought to Cairo several documents that shed a new light on the history of Khazaria and Kievan Rus', namely, the Khazar Correspondence, the Schechter Letter, and the Kievian Letter. The Genizah remained in use until it was emptied by Western scholars eager for its material. A number of other genizot have provided smaller discoveries across the Old World, notably Italian ones such as that of Perugia. An 11th-century Afghan Geniza was found in 2011. The Cairo Genizah fragments were extensively studied, cataloged and translated by Paul E. Kahle. His book, The Cairo Geniza was published by Blackwell in 1958, with a second edition in 1959. =Accounting= Jewish bankers in Old Cairo used a double-entry bookkeeping system which predated any known usage of such a form in Italy, and whose records remain from the 11th century AD, found amongst the Cairo Geniza.\\"Medieval Traders as International Change Agents: A Comment\\".

He was named after his paternal grandfather, who died on March 25, 1790. His maternal grandfather was George Parker.

His brother George P. Upshur (1799-1852)Appleton's Cyclopedia Vol. VII p. 213 became a distinguished naval officer; another brother was John Brown Upshur (1776-1822). His niece Mary Jane Stith Sturges (1828-1891) married New Yorker Josiah R. Sturges after the Civil War, helped organize the Harlem Free Hospital as well as published a historical novel, Confederate Notes, in 1867, either anonymously or under the pseudonym \\"Fanny Fielding\\". After receiving a basic education through private tutors suitable for his class, Upshur attended Princeton University and Yale College; he was expelled from the former for participating in a student rebellion. He graduated from neither institution, instead returning to Richmond, Virginia, to study law with William Wirt.VBE Marriage and family Upshur first married Elizabeth Dennis in Accomack County, Virginia on February 26, 1817; she died in childbirth on November 28, 1817.

He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Congress. Northampton County voters returned him as one of their legislative delegates in 1825, and re- elected him in 1826, but he did not fill the second term, since fellow delegates elected him as a judge of the Virginia General Court in 1826. Throughout his political career, Upshur was a slaveholder, as well as stalwart conservative and advocate for states' rights. Upshur again won election in 1829, this time as one of the four delegates representing Mathews, Middlesex, Accomac, Northampton and Gloucester Counties in the Virginia State Constitutional Convention of 1829‚Äì1830, where he served alongside Thomas R.

He expressed similar views during the nullification movement in South Carolina in 1832; he defended the principle of nullification and the state in a series of letters entitled \\"An Exposition of the Virginia Resolutions of 1798\\". In 1839, Upshur also set forth his white supremacist views in an essay published by Richmond's Southern Literary Messenger.Brent Tartar, The Grandees of Government (University of Virginia Press 2013) pp. 156-159, citing in part \\"On Domestic Slavery\\" in Southern Literary Messenger (1839) p. 678 (Although Upshur opposed universal white manhood suffrage at that constitutional convention, such would happen at the next constitutional convention, in 1850, after Upshur's death.) Although a Federalist in his youth, Upshur became a states rights man in 1816, even a Jacksonian Democrat. However, after President Andrew Jackson (a slaveowner himself) refused to countenance South Carolina's nullification, he changed parties again and became a Whig.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia available online Upshur's view of the Constitution received its fullest expression in his 1840 treatise in response to Judge Joseph Story, A Brief Enquiry into the Nature and Character of our Federal Government: Being a Review of Judge Story's Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States. The reorganized state legislature again elected Upshur judge of the Northampton Circuit Court, and he continued in that position until 1841, when he became Secretary of the Navy, as described below. =Secretary of the Navy= After John Tyler became President of the United States in 1841, he appointed Upshur as the 13th United States Secretary of the Navy in October of that year. His time with the Navy was marked by a strong emphasis on reform and reorganization, and efforts to expand and modernize the service. He served from October 11, 1841, to July 23, 1843. Among his achievements were the replacement of the old Board of Navy Commissioners with the bureau system, regularization of the officer corps, increased Navy appropriations, construction of new sailing and steam warships, and the establishment of the United States Naval Observatory and Hydrographic Office. Abel P. Upshur was also a staunch advocate for the expansion of the size of the U.S. Navy. Upshur sought the United States Navy to be at least half the size of the British Royal Navy.Hall, Claude H. ‚ÄúAbel P. Upshur and the Navy as an Instrument of Foreign Policy.‚Äù The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 69, no. 3, 1961, pp. 290‚Äì299, p. 293. =Secretary of State= In July 1843, President Tyler appointed Upshur United States Secretary of State to succeed Daniel Webster, who had resigned. His chief accomplishment was advocating for the annexation of the Republic of Texas as a slave state. Upshur and Texas ambassador Isaac Van Zandt worked closely on the treaty of annexation until Upshur's death. He was also deeply involved in the negotiations in the Oregon boundary dispute and was a strong advocate of bringing the Oregon Country into the union. He was eventually willing to settle on the 49th parallel compromise for the northern border between the United States and Canada, although negotiations were not finished until after his death and the end of Tyler's term as president. USS Princeton explosion On February 28, 1844, Upshur joined President Tyler and about 400 other dignitaries examining the new steamship , which sailed down the Potomac River from Alexandria, Virginia. He, his successor as Secretary of the Navy Gilmer and four other passengers died and many other officers and passengers were wounded when one of the ship's guns exploded near Fort Washington, Maryland during a demonstration of its firing power. Upshur was buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Thirty years later his remains were re-interred at Oak Hill Cemetery.

Accessed 16 February 2007 When he died, his age of 115 years and 252 days was the longest verified lifespan of any male in modern history until 28 December 2012, when Jiroemon Kimura of Japan surpassed this record. Mortensen was the first man confirmed to reach age 115 (in 1997). Mortensen was baptized in Fruering Church on December 26, 1882.Christian Mortensen's birth record (see image) shows his birthplace as the village of Skaarup, Denmark, which was located in Sogn Fruering parish, Herred Hjelmslev Hundred, Skanderborg county, which is now part of Skanderborg municipality. Besides his baptismal record, other records include the 1890 and 1901 census enumerations in Denmark, and church confirmation in 1896. Biography Christian Mortensen was born the son of a tailor in the village of Skaarup, near the city of Skanderborg, Denmark, on August 16, 1882. He began work as a tailor's apprentice in Skanderborg at age 16, in 1898, and later took work as a farmhand. Birth record Mortensen emigrated to the United States in 1903, then aged about 20 or 21 years old. He traveled while working as a tailor, but settled in Chicago, where he had relatives. Mortensen worked various trades, including as a milkman for Borden's Milk, as a restaurateur, and as a factory worker for the Continental Can Company. He was married for less than ten years, divorced and had no children. He did not remarry. In 1950, Mortensen retired near Galveston Bay, Texas. Then, 28 years later at the age of 96, he moved to a retirement home in San Rafael, California. Mortensen claimed he rode his bicycle to the Aldersly Retirement Community, telling the staff that he was there to stay. Mortensen lived at Aldersly for almost 20 years until his death in 1998. Mortensen was visited by James Vaupel and other longevity researchers on the occasion of his 113th birthday. He was particularly pleased with a box of Danish cigars that the researchers had brought him. Mortensen enjoyed an occasional cigar and insisted that smoking in moderation was not unhealthy. Mortensen preferred a vegetarian diet. He also drank boiled water. Mortensen was legally blind towards the end of his life and spent the last years of his life much of his time in a wheelchair listening to the radio. Toward the end of his life, his memory of distant events was good, but he could not remember recent events and increasingly needed assistance from the Aldersly staff. On his 115th birthday, Mortensen gave his advice for a long life: \\"Friends, a good cigar, drinking lots of good water, no alcohol, staying positive and lots of singing will keep you alive for a long time\\".

He was a younger son of Roger de Montgomery and Mabel de Bell√™me. Arnulf's father was a leading magnate in Normandy and England, and played an active part in the Anglo-Norman invasion of Wales in the late eleventh century. Following the Montgomerys' successes against the Welsh, Arnulf established himself at Pembroke, where an earth and timber castle was erected, and was probably rewarded with the title Earl of Pembroke. At the turn of the twelfth century Arnulf reached height, with his lordship including much of the former Welsh Kingdom of Deheubarth as well as various lands in Yorkshire. Not long after reaching this apex of his career, Arnulf assisted his eldest surviving brother, Robert de Bell√™me, in a rebellion against Henry I, King of England. It was also about this time that Arnulf married a daughter of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster, in what appears to have been an effort to gain military support against the English Crown. Following the ultimate collapse of the rebellion, however, the Montgomerys were outlawed and banished from the realm, and Arnulf appears to have spent much of the next twenty-odd years in a peripatetic life in Ireland and Normandy. Arnulf's career exemplifies the opportunities available to younger sons of the Anglo- Norman aristocracy. Arnulf appears to have died between 1118 and 1122. A tombstone in Tulsk, Ireland bears the name of Arnoul (Arnulf) and the date 1122. Arnulf and his wife Lafracoth (daughter of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster) are known to have left one daughter, Alice, who was born circa 1115; however, according to Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, Arnulf and Lafracoth had two children, Robert and Alice, who would have progeny.Curtis, E. ‚ÄúMurchertach O'Brien, High King of Ireland, and His Norman Son-in-Law, Arnulf De Montgomery, circa 1100.‚Äù The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, vol. 11, no. 2, (1921), pp. 116‚Äì124.Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, J.A. Stargardt Verlag, Marburg, Schwennicke, Detlev (Ed.), Vol. 3, 4th part, (1989), Table 640. Background Locations relating to Arnulf's life and times. Arnulf was likely born in the late 1060s,Chandler (1989) p. 8. possibly about 1066.Thompson (2004b). He was a younger son of Roger de Montgomery, Vicomte of the Hi√®mois and Mabel de Bell√™me.Mason, JFA (2004b); Keats-Rohan (1999) pp. 399‚Äì400. Arnulf's parents likely married in about 1050.Mason, JFA (2004b). His mother was a daughter of, and eventual heiress of, William de Bell√™me, Lord of Alen√ßon. Arnulf's father, a kinsman and close companion of William II, Duke of Normandy, was an eminent magnate in Normandy.Mason, JFA (2004b); Keats-Rohan (1999) pp. 399‚Äì400; Hollister (1977) p. 63; Mason, JFA (1963) pp. 1‚Äì5. As tutor to Matilda, Duchess of Normandy, Roger and his eldest sons did not embark on the 1066 Norman invasion of England. When William returned to Normandy as king in 1067, Roger accompanied him back to England, and was granted extensive lands, including the Sussex rapes of Arundel and Chichester, followed by the county of Shropshire. Soon afterwards, Roger was made Earl of Shrewsbury. By 1086, he was one of the wealthiest tenants-in- chief in England.Mason, JFA (2004b); Hollister (1977) pp. 63, 65 tab. a. Arnulf makes his first appearance in the historical record at about this time when he and his elder brother, Roger de Poitou, witnessed William's confirmation of their father's grant to the Norman abbey of Troarn in 1082/1083.Chandler (1989) pp. 2, 2 n. 3, 8; Davis (1913) p. 47 ¬ß 172. The Bayeux Tapestry's depiction of the Battle of Hastings. Although Arnulf's family did not participate in the invasion of England in 1066, it was richly rewarded with English lands soon afterwards. In 1088, Roger and at least three of his sons participated in plot to eject William Rufus, King of England from the throne with the intent to replace him with Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, William Rufus' elder brother.Hollinghurst (2012) p. 82; Mason, JFA (2004b); Sharpe (2004) pp. 143‚Äì145, 144 n. 25; Lewis (1989) pp. 572‚Äì573; Hollister (1977) pp. 66‚Äì67; Hollister (1973b) p. 317; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 16. This rebellion is documented by several sources, such as the ninth- to twelfth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,Whitelock (1996) pp. 165‚Äì166, 166 n. 2; Lewis (1989) pp. 572‚Äì573; Thorpe, B (1861) pp. 356‚Äì358. and the twelfth- century texts Chronicon ex chronicis,Lewis (1989) pp. 572‚Äì573; Forester (1854a), pp. 186‚Äì191; Thorpe, B (1849) pp. 21‚Äì26.

According to the \\"E\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle‚Äîthe only strictly contemporary source of the four‚ÄîRobert Curthose's followers captured Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and thereby gained control of the castle of Rochester. This source identifies several leading members of the insurrection, including three unnamed sons of Roger.Sharpe (2004) pp. 144‚Äì145, 144 n. 25; Whitelock (1996) pp. 165‚Äì166, 166 n. 2; Lewis (1989) pp. 572‚Äì573; Thorpe, B (1861) pp. 356‚Äì358. Whilst it is possible that these brothers were Roger's eldest sons Robert de Bell√™me, Hugh de Montgomery, and Roger de Poitou,Lewis (1989) p. 573; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 16; Freeman (1882a) p. 57 n. 3. it is not impossible that the latter took no part in the rising, and that the third brother was in fact Arnulf himself.Lewis (1989) p. 573, 573 n. 2; Hollister (1977) p. 71 n. 26. Although the rebellion was an ultimate failure, the king imposed no penalty upon Roger, and allowed Roger de Poitou to be reinstated with most of the lands that the eleventh-century Domesday Book shows he previously held.Mason, JFA (2004b); Mason, JFA (1963) p. 16. Rise Anglo-Norman advance into Wales, and the penetration of Montgomery power into Deheubarth,Chibnall (2006) p. 66 map 4. where Arnulf established himself at Pembroke in about 1093. Arnulf's father was one of three close supporters of the king who were settled along the Anglo-Welsh border, in a region known as the Welsh marches. Although the first real penetration of Anglo-Norman power occurred in the 1070s, it wasn't until the last decade of the eleventh century that more permanent marcher settlements were envisaged in Wales.Kenyon (2003) p. 247. In 1093, encroaching marcher lords engaged and slew Rhys ap Tewdwr, King of Deheubarth in Brycheiniog.Davies, S (2014) p. 126, 126 n. 179; Lloyd; Thornton (2004); Turvey (2002) p. 44. Contemporaries marked Rhys' fall as the end of kingship amongst the Welsh,Lloyd; Thornton (2004). and his demise left a power-vacuum in which men such as Arnulf seized upon.Davies, S (2014) pp. 126‚Äì127; Turvey (2002) p. 44; Davies, RR (2006b) pp. 34, 39. The south-west Welsh (\\"countries\\")Davies, RR (2006c) p. 12. of Ceredigion and Dyfed were thus overwhelmed and settled by the conquering incomers. In the latter (\\"country\\"), Arnulf's father founded an earth and timber castle in which Arnulf established himself.Kenyon (2010) p. 89; Brown (1992) p. 177. This ringwork,Coulson (2003) p. 52 n. 178. strategically seated on the highest point of a promontory between two tidal inlets, sat on the site where the castle of Pembroke stands today. Although nothing now remains of the original castle,Brown (1992) p. 177. it is described by the twelfth-century Itinerarium Kambri√¶ as a \\"slender fortress built of stakes and turf\\".Davies, S (2014) p. 199; Davies, RR (2006a) p. 91; Thorpe, L (1978) p. 148 bk. 1 ch 12; The Itinerary Through Wales (1908) p. 82 bk. 1 ch. 12; Dimock (1868) p. 89 bk. 1 ch. 12. William Rufus subsequently rewarded Arnulf with a lordship seated at his castle.Chandler (1989) pp. 8‚Äì9.

The castle at Pembroke is remarkable in the fact that, unlike other Anglo-Norman or English fortresses in west Wales, it never fell into the hands of the Welsh.Kenyon (2010) p. 89; Lloyd (1912) p. 401. At some time between 1097 and 1108, Arnulf's castellan at Pembroke, Gerald de Windsor, married Rhys' daughter, Nest.Johns, SM (2010) p. 102; MacCotter; Nicholls (2009) p. 49; Cohen (2006) p. 91; Crouch (2004); Lloyd; Thornton (2004); Walker (2004); Davies, RR (1990) p. 52; Roderick (1968) p. 6. According to Brut y Tywysogyon, Arnulf captured and imprisoned Rhys' young son, Hywel, before the latter was able to escape after suffering certain bodily injuries.Lloyd; Thornton (2004); Turvey (2002) p. 44; Le Patourel (1997) p. 64 n. 2; Duffy (1993) p. 11; Roderick (1968) p. 6; Lloyd (1912) p. 401, 401 n. 6; Rh≈∑s; Evans (1890) p. 295; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 120‚Äì121. Having established himself at Pembroke, Arnulf appears to have resided in England, leaving Gerald at Pembroke as his or steward.MacCotter; Nicholls (2009) p. 49; Rowlands (1981) p. 145. On his father's death in 1094, Arnulf's elder brother, Hugh de Montgomery, inherited the earldom of Shrewsbury. Surviving sources reveal that the brothers were closely associated with each other.Chandler (1989) p. 9. Within two years they made a joint grant to the far-off abbey of La Sauve-Majeure.Hollinghurst (2012) pp. 86, 1115; Strevett (2005) p. 40; Mason, E (2002) ch. 7 ¬∂ 36; Mason, E (1999) p. 136; Chandler (1989) p. 9; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 19; Davis (1913) p. 103 ¬ß 410; Round (1899) p. 446 ¬ß 1234. Furthermore, Arnulf appears to have witnessed a grant of Hugh de Montgomery's to the abbey, in a charter dated to 1095‚Äì1098.Strevett (2005) p. 40, 40 n. 79; Chandler (1989) p. 9, 9 n. 55; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 19 n. 3; Round (1899) p. 447 ¬ß 1238. In a Latin grant to the abbey of Saint-Martin de S√©es, founded by his father,Keats-Rohan (1999) p. 399. Arnulf bestowed a donation on behalf of his ancestors, lord, friends, and \\"very dear brother Hugh\\" (\\"\\").Strevett (2005) p. 40; Chandler (1989) p. 9, 9 n. 54. Although the particular wording in this grant may reveal genuine affection for his brother, these acta as a whole could reveal that Arnulf was regarded as the heir of the unmarried and childless Hugh de Montgomery,Strevett (2005) pp. 40‚Äì41. and that William Rufus intended to acknowledge this inheritance as well. The massive stone walls and towers of the castle of Pembroke bear little resemblance to Arnulf's earth and timber castle constructed in about 1093.Hull (2009) p. 17. Arnulf's fortress was replaced with this stone castle by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, and further construction was continued by the latter's heirs and successors.Kenyon (2010) pp. 89‚Äì92; Brown (1992) pp. 177‚Äì178. Partly as a result of the political conquest of Wales in the late eleventh century, the Anglo-Norman Church endeavoured to subjugate and exploit the Welsh Church. From the perspective of the English Crown, the Welsh Church was isolated, archaic, deviant, and backward-looking. Conversely, Anglo-Normans regarded themselves as religious reformers, and sought to impose their own standards and practices upon the Welsh. One way in which the Anglo-Normans imposed their ecclesiastical authority upon the Welsh was through the appointment and control of bishops.Davies, JR (2008) pp. 86‚Äì87; Davies, RR (2000) p. 179. Within a year of his consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1093, Anselm temporarily suspended the Welsh bishops of Glamorgan and St David's, revealing that these diocesan territories had fallen under Canterbury's ecclesiastical authority.Davies, JR (2008) p. 86‚Äì87; Southern (2009); Davies, RR (2000) p. 179; Southern (2000) p. 337; Vaughn (1987) p. 195; Schmitt (1949) pp. 56‚Äì57 ¬ß 175; Rule (1884) p. 72. In May 1095, Wilfrid, Bishop of St David's came to terms with Anselm.Davies, JR (2008) p. 86‚Äì87; Southern (2000) pp. 337‚Äì338; Vaughn (1987) p. 195. In turn, the latter admonished several leading Anglo-Normans holding lands in the diocese of St David's, urging them to regard Wilfrid as their bishop, and to return the lands, tithes, and churches that they had unjustly seized from him. Two marcher lords specifically singled out by Anselm were Arnulf and Robert de Bell√™me.Davies, JR (2008) p. 87; Pryce (2007) p. 311; Southern (2000) pp. 337‚Äì338; Vaughn (1987) p. 195, 195 n. 226; Schmitt (1949) p. 185 ¬ß 270. In fact, the ravaging of the lands of St Davids in 1097 by Arnulf's steward at Pembroke, Gerald, is recorded by the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Brenhinedd y Saesson, Brut y Tywysogyon, the \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" versions of the eleventh- to thirteenth-century Annales Cambri√¶.Gough-Cooper (2015a) p. 52 ¬ß b1119.1; Gough-Cooper (2015b) p. 31 ¬ß c418.1; Pryce (2007) pp. 311‚Äì312 n. 48; Rh≈∑s; Evans (1890) pp. 272‚Äì273; Jones; Williams; Pughe (1870) p. 666; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 58‚Äì61. As a friend of the archbishop, Arnulf may have been more liable to respect this call of restraint from Anselm than from anyone else.Southern (2000) pp. 337‚Äì338, 339. Seal of William Rufus. The device depicts the armament of a late eleventh-century mounted knight. In 1098, together with Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester, Hugh de Montgomery led a summer invasion of Gwynedd. Although the Anglo-Normans easily defeated the Welsh defenders, the attackers were later overwhelmed on Anglesey in an encounter with the forces of Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson, King of Norway.Etchingham (2007) p. 161; Mason, JFA (2004a); Chandler (1989) p. 9; Candon (1988) p. 405; Forester (1854b) pp. 218‚Äì219 bk. 10 ch. 6; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 30‚Äì32 bk. 10 ch. 6. Arnulf appears to have learned of his brother's fate about a month later in Normandy, since he travelled to S√©es, and founded a priory of the abbey's monks at Pembroke in dedication to the memory of Hugh de Montgomery and his father.Hollinghurst (2012) p. 86; Strevett (2005) pp. 40‚Äì41; Chandler (1989) pp. 9‚Äì10; Cokayne; White (1949) p. 689 n. c; Round (1899) pp. 237‚Äì238 ¬ß 666. Although Arnulf may well have hoped to inherit his brother's title and lands, William Rufus granted them to Arnulf's older brother Robert de Bell√™me,Mason, E (2002) ch. 7 ¬∂ 36; Thompson (2004a); Thompson (2004b); Chandler (1989) p. 10; Hollister (1977) p. 74; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 20. who had captured Helias de la Fl√®che, Count of Maine only months before, dutifully handing the count over to the king.Thompson (2004a); Mason, E (2002) ch. 7 ¬∂¬∂ 36, 39; Hollister (1977) p. 74; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 20. Downfall Royal MS 14 B VI (n.d.). At the turn of the twelfth century, the Montgomerys were one of the leading families in England. At this point, Robert de Bell√™me had reached the height of his power,Thompson (2004a); Thompson (1991) p. 276; Hollister (1973b) pp. 317‚Äì318, 318 n. 2. and appears to have been the most powerful and prosperous magnate in the Anglo-Norman world.Hollister (2003) pp. 154‚Äì155; Thompson (1991) p. 286. Besides inheriting the expansive continental lands of the Montgomery and Bell√™me families, and succeeding to the earldom of Shrewsbury and the rape of Arundel, Robert de Bell√™me also obtained the honour of Tickhill in Nottinghamshire and southern Yorkshire. Furthermore, by right of his wife's inheritance, Robert de Bell√™me gained the small but important continental county of Ponthieu.Thompson (2004a); Hollister (2003) pp. 154‚Äì155; Thompson (1991) pp. 275‚Äì276. His brother, Roger de Poitou, was one of the most powerful magnates in northwest England,Thompson (2004a). holding lands in Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Essex, Yorkshire, and Suffolk. By right of his wife, he gained the continental county of La Marche.Hollister (2003) p. 155; Lewis (1989) p. 571. As for their brother, Arnulf, he likely held the Earldom of Pembroke, a lordship which appears to have constituted the core of the former Kingdom of Deheubarth.Crouch (2007) p. 174. Arnulf gained the lordship of Holderness, following the downfall of its former lord, the disgraced Odo, Count of Champagne.Hollinghurst (2012) p. 82; Dalton (2002) pp. 86, 93; Dalton (1990) p. 54; Chandler (1989) p. 9; Farrer (1989) pp. 27‚Äì28 ¬ß 1300; Hollister (1977) pp. 69 tab. b, 70, 71 n. 26; Davis (1913) p. 116 ¬ß 483; Round (1899) pp. xl‚Äìxli, 238 ¬ß 667, 446‚Äì447 ¬ß 1235, 447 ¬ß 1236. Robert Curthose as depicted on folio 5r of British Library Royal 14 B VI. In August 1100, whilst Robert Curthose was absent en route from the Holy Land, the reigning William Rufus was killed, and the vacant English throne was seized by their younger brother, Henry, Count of the Cotentin. Fearing an invasion from Normandy by Robert Curthose, an early act of Henry's reign was an alliance with Robert II, Count of Flanders, formalised by treaty in March 1101.Thompson (1995) p. 49. One of the guarantors recorded lending surety for the English king was Arnulf himself.Thompson (2004b); van Houts (1999); Thompson (1995) p. 49; Thompson (1991) p. 276 n. 62; Chandler (1989) p. 10; Hollister (1973b) p. 320 n. 3; Johnson; Cronne (1956) p. 7 ¬ß 515. Guarantors to such acts often led negotiations between involved parties, which could indicate that Arnulf acted as an intermediary between the king and count. Although his involvement on Henry's behalf further evidences Arnulf's considerable status, his career in the king's service was short-lived. Although Robert de Bell√™me had initially accepted Henry as king,Thompson (2004a); Thompson (1991) p. 276, 276 n. 59. by the time Robert Curthose asserted his claim to the throne at Alton in 1101, Robert de Bell√™me was supporting the duke's cause. According to Historia ecclesiastica, the king spent a year collecting evidence against Robert de Bell√™me; and in 1102, Henry summoned the latter, charging him with forty-five different offences against himself and Robert Curthose.Thompson (2004a); Hollister (2003) p. 157; Forester (1854b) p. 331 bk. 11 ch. 3; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 169‚Äì170 bk. 11 ch. 3. According to Brut y Tywysogyon, Arnulf was likewise summoned and charged.Strevett (2005) p. 161; Hollister (2003) p. 157. Arnulf appears to have fled to Wales,Crouch (2007) p. 174; Strevett (2005) p. 161. and Historia ecclesiastica records that Robert de Bell√™me fortified his English castles against Henry's men.Crouch (2007) p. 174; Thompson (2004a); Hollister (2003) p. 157. Whilst Robert de Bell√™me made alliances with the Welsh, Arnulf reached out to the Irish.Bracken (2004); Thompson (2004a); Duffy (1997) pp. 44‚Äì45; Duffy (1993) p. 12. Specifically, Brut y Tywysogyon reveals that Arnulf sent Gerald to Ireland in order to arrange military assistance from Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster.Bracken (2004); Duffy (1997) pp. 44‚Äì45; Duffy (1993) p. 12; Curtis (1921) p. 118; Candon (1988) p. 411; Rh≈∑s; Evans (1890) p. 276; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 68‚Äì69. The alliance was formalised by a remarkable marriage between Arnulf and one of Muirchertach's daughters, the record of which is preserved by Historia ecclesiastica,Green (2000) p. 107; Holland (2000) p. 130, 130 n. 90; Chandler (1989) p. 11 n. 65; Candon (1988) p. 411; Vaughn (1987) p. 333 n. 111; Curtis (1921) p. 118, 118 n. 5; Forester (1854b) p. 338 bk. 11 ch. 3; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 177‚Äì178 bk. 11 ch. 3.

These sources are further corroborated by a particular letter from Muirchertach to Anselm,N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 147; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (2017) p. 298; Bracken (2004); Duffy (1997) p. 45; Schmitt (1951) p. 372 ¬ß 426; Curtis (1921) pp. 118, 118‚Äì119 n. 6; Elrington; Todd (n.d.) p. 526.‚Äîperhaps dating to about 1105√ì Cr√≥in√≠n (2017) p. 298. or 1106/1107,Chandler (1989) p. 12.‚Äîin which Muirchertach expressed his gratitude to the archbishop for intervening with Henry on behalf of \\"my son- in-law Arnulf\\".

What specifically motivated Muirchertach to agree to an alliance is unknown. It certainly brought him into close contact with one of Europe's leading families.Candon (1988) pp. 411‚Äì412, 414‚Äì415. One possibility is that he was attempting to enhance his status on an international stage.Holland (2000) p. 130. He may have also sought to secure the valuable trade route from south Wales and the Bristol Channel to Waterford.Duffy (2004) pp. 100‚Äì101; Duffy (1993) p. 12. His involvement may well have formed part of a larger plan to not only increase power in Ireland but further exert influence throughout the Irish Sea region.Oram (2011) pp. 52‚Äì53. As for Arnulf, the marital alliance could have been undertaken in an attempt to enhance his own status in society.Molchan (2013) pp. 46‚Äì47. On the other hand, the marriage may have been a path by which Arnulf or his brother attempted to gain access to Muirchertach's military might.Duffy (2013) ch. 6; Flanagan (2008) p. 911; Downham (2013) pp. 173‚Äì174; Davies, RR (1990) p. 52; Power (1986) pp. 125‚Äì126. Furthermore, the alliance may have been coordinated as a means to gain the neutrality of Muirchertach's powerful ally, Magn√∫s, the king who had killed Hugh de Montgomery in 1098.Flanagan (2008) p. 911. Alternately, the Montgomerys may have intented to enlist military assistance from Magn√∫s.Oram (2011) p. 52; Flanagan (2008) p. 911; Green (2000) p. 107; Wyatt (1999) pp. 612‚Äì613; Power (1986) pp. 125‚Äì126. Certainly, Historia ecclesiastica states that Henry was greatly concerned with Magn√∫s' presence in the region, although there is no evidence that the Norwegians assisted the rebels.Wyatt (1999) p. 613; Forester (1854b) p. 351 bk. 11 ch. 8; Le Prevost (1852) p. 194 bk. 11 ch. 8. Despite the fact that Brut y Tywysogyon reports that Muirchertach lent the two brothers military support,Babcock (2007) p. 53; Davies, RR (1990) p. 52; Rh≈∑s; Evans (1890) p. 276; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 68‚Äì69. and the distinct possibility that Roger de Poitou aided them as well,Lieberman (2010) p. 68; Hollister (1973b) p. 318. the Bell√™me-Montgomery insurrection ended in utter failure.Lieberman (2010) p. 68. The ruinous castle of Bridgnorth. After the castle's fall to Henry's forces in 1102, the Bell√™me- Montgomery rebellion quickly collapsed. Initial work on the tower may have taken place under Robert de Bell√™me, although it appears to have been at least completed under Henry.Dixon (2008) p. 260. Surviving sources give differing accounts of the rebellion.Hollister (2003) p. 158. Arnulf's principal contribution appears to have been his participation in a predatory strike into Staffordshire.Chandler (1989) p. 11. According to the twelfth-century Historia regum Anglorum and Chronicon ex chronicis, Robert de Bell√™me and Arnulf, supported by Welsh allies, ravaged a part of the county, before carrying off livestock and men to Wales.Hollister (2003) p. 158; Morillo (1997) p. 101; Chandler (1989) p. 11; Arnold (1885) p. 234 ch. 183; Stevenson (1855) pp. 583‚Äì584; Forester (1854a) p. 210; Thorpe, B (1849) p. 50. The detailed account of the general uprising preserved by Historia ecclesiastica appears to be the most reliable record of events. This source reveals that, following Robert de Bell√™me's flight from the king's summons, Henry appears to have raised a feudal host consisting of his tenants-in-chief (who owed him knight-service) and the old English fyrd (a levy of one armed man from about every five hides or six carucates).Hollister (1998) p. 142, 142 n. 1; Hollister (2003) p. 159. Both Chronicon ex chronicisBurke (2011) p. 41; Forester (1854a), pp. 210‚Äì211; Thorpe, B (1849) pp. 50‚Äì51. and Historia ecclesiastica and state that Henry's host besieged the castle of Arundel for three months before its capitulation, after which the king led his forces to the castle of Tickhill which immediately surrendered.Hollister (2003) p. 159; Forester (1854b) p. 332 bk. 11 ch. 3; Le Prevost (1852) p. 170 bk. 11 ch. 3. After temporarily standing down his army, Henry resumed operations in the autumn, he is recorded to have seized the castle of Bridgnorth after a three-week siege. At about this point, William Pantulf, a former vassal of the Montgomerys, is stated to have offered his services to Robert de Bell√™me. Upon being rebuffed by the latter, William Pantulf is recorded to have gone over to Henry's side, and was apparently instrumental in convincing Robert de Bell√™me's Welsh allies desert him and support the king instead.Hollister (2003) p. 159; Forester (1854b) pp. 334‚Äì336 bk. 11 ch. 3; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 174‚Äì176 bk. 11 ch. 3. Brut y Tywysogyon specifically states that Iorwerth ap Bleddyn, a leading Welshman, was bought off by the king and began to harry his former ally's lands.Hollister (2003) p. 160; Rh≈∑s; Evans (1890) pp. 276‚Äì277; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 70‚Äì71. After Henry's forces marched to Shrewsbury itself, Historia ecclesiastica records that Robert de Bell√™me's submitted to the king in person.Hollister (2003) p. 160; Forester (1854b) p. 337 bk. 11 ch. 3; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 176‚Äì177 bk. 11 ch. 3. Defeated, the three surviving sons of Roger de Montgomery were banished from the kingdom, with their lands and titles declared forfeit.Hollinghurst (2012) p. 82; Lieberman (2010) p. 112; Babcock (2007) p. 53; Mason, JFA (2004b); Thompson (2004a); Hollister (1977) p. 80.

Rawl. B. 489 (2008). Whilst Robert fled to the continent, surviving sources suggest that Arnulf‚Äîand likely others from the ill-fated insurrection‚Äîsought refuge in Ireland.Babcock (2007) pp. 53‚Äì54; Duffy (2004) p. 101; Candon (1988) p. 412. Certainly, Gesta regum Anglorum makes note of a deterioration in relations between Muirchertach and Henry before an English trade embargo forced reconciliation upon the Irish.Wyatt (2018) p. 791, 791 n. 199; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (2017) p. 298; Duffy (2013) ch. 6; Duffy (2009) pp. 297‚Äì298; Wyatt (2009) p. 385; Flanagan (2008) p. 911; Babcock (2007) pp. 53‚Äì54; Duffy (2005); Hudson (2004) p. 52; Holland (2000) pp. 131‚Äì132; Duffy (1997) p. 45; Bradley (1994) p. 178; Duffy (1993) p. 12; Candon (1988) p. 412; Giles (1847) p. 443 bk. 5; Hardy (1840) p. 638 bk. 5 ch. 409. One possibility is that this episode occurred as a consequence Muirchertach's alliance with the Montgomerys,Swift (2013) p. 135; Flanagan (2008) pp. 911, 914; Babcock (2007) pp. 53‚Äì54; Duffy (2005); Hudson (2004) p. 52; Holland (2000) pp. 130‚Äì131; Duffy (1997) p. 45; Duffy (1993) p. 12; . and his part in their rebellion.Flanagan (2008) p. 911;Babcock (2007) pp. 53‚Äì54; Hudson (2004) p. 52; Oram (2000) 59; Bradley (1994) p. 178; Candon (1988) p. 412. Furthermore, Historia ecclesiastica claims that Arnulf and other Normans assisted the Muirchertach in a military capacity, apparently against the forces of Magn√∫s himself. However, after the latter fell in battle against Muirchertach's forces, this source states that the Irish turned upon the Normans, and that Muirchertach forced Arnulf from Ireland altogether.Duffy (2013) ch. 6; Babcock (2007) p. 54; Duffy (2004) p. 101; Duffy (1997) pp. 45‚Äì46; Duffy (1993) p. 13; Candon (1988) p. 412; Forester (1854b) pp. 350‚Äì351 bk. 11 ch. 8; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 193‚Äì194 bk. 11 ch. 8. In fact, the details of this account are likely erroneous, as Magn√∫s appears to have fallen against the Ulaid, not Muirchertach's men.Babcock (2007) p. 54. The claim of Arnulf's flight from Ireland, and Muirchertach's enmity against him, may be mistaken as well, especially in light of the emphatic letter between Muirchertach and Anselm concerning Arnulf.Duffy (2009) pp. 297‚Äì298; Babcock (2007) p. 54; Duffy (1993) pp. 13‚Äì14. Such mediation between the Irish and English monarchs would seem to have been conducted whilst Arnulf was a resident at Muirchertach's royal court.Duffy (1993) p. 14. In any event, the account preserved by Historia ecclesiastica may be evidence of English mercenarial involvement in Ireland during Henry's reign.Babcock (2007) p. 54; Duffy (2004) p. 101; Duffy (1997) pp. 45‚Äì46; Duffy (1993) p. 14. It is conceivable that Arnulf did indeed campaign in Ireland on behalf of Muirchertach, and that the latter's marital alliances with Magn√∫s and Arnulf in 1102 were undertaken in the context of offsetting Muirchertach's main rival, Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen√©l nE√≥gain.Candon (1996) pp. 43‚Äì44; Duffy (1993) p. 13; Candon (1991) p. 23. It may have been that Muirchertach regarded Arnulf as insurance against the prospect of future treachery from Magn√∫s.Duffy (1993) p. 13; Chandler (1989) pp. 10‚Äì11. Whatever the case, unfortunately for Muirchertach, not only was Magn√∫s slain in a skirmish in the following year,Babcock (2007) p. 54; Bracken (2004); Candon (1996) p. 44. but Muirchertach's forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of Domnall's forces at Mag Coba.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n (2017) p. 297; The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1103.5; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß¬ß 1103.3, 1103.4; Chronicon Scotorum (2012) ¬ß 1103; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß¬ß 1103.3, 1103.4; Annals of Tigernach (2010) ¬ß¬ß 1103.3, 1103.4; Chronicon Scotorum (2010) ¬ß 1103; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß¬ß 1103.3, 1103.4; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1103.3; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1103.5; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1103.3; Candon (1996) pp. 43‚Äì45. If there is any truth to the claim of Arnulf being driven from Ireland, it is possible that Historia ecclesiastica may evince an attempt by Muirchertach to mend fractured relations with Henry.Candon (1988) pp. 412‚Äì413. A fifteenth-century depiction of the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 as depicted on folio 256v of Bibliotheque nationale de France Fran√ßais 226.Fran√ßais 226 (1988). A Welsh source suggests that Arnulf partook in this clash between the forces of Henry and Robert Curthose. Robert Curthose initially agreed to support Henry against the banished Robert de Bell√™me, who was now in Normandy and hostile to the duke.Thompson (2004c). At some point before June 1103, Arnulf appears to have betrayed his brother's trust, since Historia ecclesiastica states that Arnulf took the castle of Alm√©n√™ches, a Montgomery family stronghold, and handed it over to the duke.Thompson (2004a); Thompson (2004b); Thompson (2004c); Thompson (1995) p. 50, 50 n. 9; Chandler (1989) p. 11; Cokayne; White (1949) p. 693 n. d; Forester (1854b) p. 339 bk. 11 ch. 3; Le Prevost (1852) p. 179 bk. 11 ch. 3. It may have been at this point that Arnulf sought refuge in Ireland.Thompson (1995) p. 50. Whatever the case, Robert de Bell√™me's efforts to recover the castle led to his razing of the nearby nunnery of Alm√©n√™ches, where his sister, Emma, was abbess.Burke (2011) p. 42; Thompson (2004a). By 1104, his military successes against the duke forced the latter to come to terms. With Robert de Bell√™me and Robert Curthose thus reconciled, Henry turned against the two and finally defeated them in battle, near the castle of Tinchebray in September 1106.Thompson (2004a); Thompson (2004c). Although a version of Brut y Tywysogyon suggests that Arnulf took part in the battle, the account of Arnulf's earlier betrayal at Alm√©n√™ches preserved by Historia ecclesiastica may contradict this.Chandler (1989) p. 11 n. 76. Despite the correspondence evidencing Anselm's reconciliation of Henry with Arnulf, the latter never held land in England ever again,Hollister (1973a) p. 121; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 24 n. 2. and appears to have endured a peripatetic career for about twenty years.Thompson (2004b); Mason, JFA (1963) p. 24. Evidence that he visited England, at least on one occasion, may be preserved by Vita Anselmi which states that Arnulf made a returning voyage from Normandy (\\"\\").Chandler (1989) p. 12, 12 n. 79; Mason, JFA (1963) p. 24 n. 2; Southern (1962) p. 146; Rule (1884) pp. 419‚Äì420. Henry as depicted on folio 5r of British Library Royal 14 B VI. Between 1110 and 1112, Robert de Bell√™me involved himself in uprisings in southern Normandy, encouraged by Henry's opponent, the recently inaugurated Foulques, Count of Anjou and Maine. Henry responded by bringing charges against Robert de Bell√™me, and finally seizing him in November 1112. The latter's lands were declared forfeit, and he was imprisoned by the king for the rest of his life. During the first quarter of the twelfth century, Arnulf attested eight charters of Foulques, making Arnulf one of the count's most frequent witnesses.Chevalier (2010) p. 476 ¬ß 439; Barton (2005) p. 34 n. 11; Thompson (2004b); Chandler (1989) p. 12; Denis (1912) pp. 83‚Äì85 ¬ß 60; M√©tais (1894) pp. 208‚Äì209 ¬ß 434; Marchegay (1843) p. 380 ¬ß 36. In about 1114, Arnulf witnessed an act between his great-niece, Philippa, Countess of Poitou, and Bernard- Aton, Vicomte of B√©ziers.Thompson (2004b); Chandler (1989) p. 12; Richard (1903) pp. 469‚Äì470; Devic; Vaiss√®te (1875) p. 845 ¬ß 451. Arnulf's influence at Foulques's court appears to be evidenced by particular actions in 1118. That year the townsfolk of Alen√ßon rebelled against Henry and their lord Stephen, Count of Mortain,Thompson (2004b); Chandler (1989) pp. 12‚Äì13. whilst the latter were campaigning against a continental coalition attempting to replace the king with Robert Curthose's illegitimate son, William Clito.Hollister (2004). The region of Alen√ßon was a former power centre of the Bell√™me family, and according to Historia ecclesiastica, the townsfolk requested that Arnulf intervene with Foulques on their behalf against Stephen's injustices and oppression.Slater (2009) p. 73, 73 n. 18; Barton (2005) pp. 33‚Äì34; Thompson (2004b); Thompson (1995) p. 49; Chandler (1989) pp. 12‚Äì13; Forester (1854b) pp. 461‚Äì462 bk. 12 ch. 8; Le Prevost (1852) pp. 331‚Äì332 bk. 12 ch. 8. In what turned out to be Henry's single greatest defeat,Hollister (2003) p. 252. Foulques' troops then seized the town and besieged the citadel, before crushing Henry's relief forces, after which Foulques secured the citadel once and for all.Morillo (1997) pp. 107, 142‚Äì143, 170‚Äì171. Arnulf, probably now in his fifties, is not noted in any of the surviving sources documenting the clash.Chandler (1989) p. 13. Nevertheless, he and his family could well have been responsible for an uprising that appears to flared up at about the same time in former Montgomery-Bell√™me lands in central Normandy. This insurrection seems to have contributed to Henry's restoration of much of the former Montgomery-Bell√™me lands in Normandy to Robert de Bell√™me's son, William III, Count of Ponthieu, in June 1119.Thompson (1995) p. 52; Thompson (1994) p. 172. The abbey of Alm√©n√™ches was founded by Arnulf's father, Roger de Montgomery.Hollinghurst (2012) p. 84; Mason, JFA (2004b). The next certain record concerning Arnulf occurs in 1122, when his name is listed in a mortuary roll, circulated after the death of churchman Vitalis of Savigny, in which the nuns of the abbey of Alm√©n√™ches commemorated him, his parents, and his younger brother Philip.Chandler (1989) p. 13; Delisle (1866) pp. 281‚Äì282, 325. Arnulf, therefore, died sometime between 1118 and 1122.Thompson (2004b); Chandler (1989) p. 13. The depiction of Arnulf's death preserved by Historia ecclesiastica is likely unhistorical. This account relates that, following Magn√∫s' death, Arnulf was forced from Ireland by Muirchertach, only to return about twenty years later, whereupon he remarried the latter's daughter, and died following the feast.Power (2005) p. 17 n. 15; Chandler (1989) p. 13; Curtis (1921) p. 122; Forester (1854b) p. 351 bk. 11 ch. 8; Le Prevost (1852) p. 194 bk. 11 ch. 8. Eminent authorities assert that Arnulf left by his wife Lafracoth, a daughter, Alice, who married Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan.Weis, Frederick Lewis.

According to Historia ecclesiastica, Mabel was murdered by a vassal, a particular act that may evidence her unpleasantness.Mason, JFA (1963) p. 25. Historia ecclesiastica describes Hugh de Montgomery as the only \\"mild and loveable\\" () of Mabel's sons,Mason, JFA (2004a). whilst Welsh sources present him in a much more negative light.Mason, JFA (2004a); Thompson (1991) pp. 281‚Äì282; Mason, JFA (1963) pp. 24‚Äì25, 25 n. 1. A source concerning Arnulf may be Planctus Ricemarch, a sorrowful Latin lament composed by scholar Rhygyfarch ap Sulien. This source‚Äîa contemporary composition bewailing the cultural upheaval and oppression inflicted upon the Welsh after the Anglo- Norman conquests of 1093‚Äîmay refer to subjugation suffered under Arnulf and his father.Mason, JFA (1963) p. 25; Snyder (2003) p. 230; Lawlor (1914) pp. 121‚Äì123. The actions of the Montgomery family illustrate the remarkable speed at which Norman families could spread across far-flung regions. Although Norman families tended to practice primogeniture, the conquest of England and the opening up of Britain contributed a new area of exploitation for landless younger sons of the aristocracy.Frame (2001) pp. 36‚Äì37; Le Patourel (1997) pp. 292‚Äì293. The careers of younger sons of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy are often obscure, with few surviving sources documenting their activities. The younger sons of Roger de Montgomery and Mabel are an exception, and Arnulf's career illustrates the various opportunities available to contemporaries of his rank‚Äîmen who could not rely upon inheritance alone, and who had to acquire territories of their own.Lieberman (2010) pp. 108‚Äì109 Thompson (2004b); Frame (2001) pp. 36‚Äì37; Le Patourel (1997) pp. 191‚Äì192 n. 4, 292‚Äì293. Despite losing his lands later in his career, Arnulf's numerous and regular attestations in court circles reveal that he retained substantial personal prestige. The far- flung nature of these attestations may well indicate that his skills as a negotiator were well-known and valued. Indeed, Arnulf's career reveals the importance of personal-connections in the courtly-world of the Anglo-Norman era.Thompson (1995) pp. 52‚Äì53. Arnulf's family‚Äîtraced with certainty only two patrilineal generations previousMason, JFA (2004b); Douglas (1983) p. 91.‚Äîderived its surname from lands now known as Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery and Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery, in Calvados, Normandy.Mason, JFA (2004b); Keats- Rohan (1999) pp. 399‚Äì400; Loyd (1992) pp. 68‚Äì69.

Like other ships of the class, Aurora was named after a figure of mythology, Aurora being the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Eos. History HMS Aurora was built by John Brown & Company, shipbuilders of Clydebank, Scotland. Aurora was launched on 28 November 1962 and commissioned on 9 April 1964. Aurora became the leader of the 2nd Frigate Squadron in 1964, under the command of Captain BH Notley RN. From 1967 to 1968, Derek Bazalgette served her as Commanding Officer. On 17 April 1968, her Westland Wasp ASW helicopter from 829 Naval Air Squadron (s/n XS540, No. 455) crashed off South Africa. It was replaced by an aircraft (No. 444) from HMS Gurkha (F122). In August 1969, Aurora, together with the American destroyer and the French destroyer , took part in the commemorations at Th√©oule-sur-Mer of the 25th anniversary of Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France. From 1970 to 1971, Paul Greening served as her Commanding Officer. In 1972, during the Second Cod War, Aurora came to the aid of an Icelandic fishing vessel that had caught fire, rescuing its crew in the process. Soon after this incident, Aurora underwent modernisation which included the addition of the Ikara anti- submarine warfare (ASW) missile launcher that in effect changed the Batch One ships, of which Aurora was part, into a specialised ASW batch rather than its original role as a general-purpose batch. The modernisation was completed in 1976. In 1978, Aurora joined the Fishery Protection Squadron, undertaking patrols and other duties in support of British fishing interests around the UK. She remained with the squadron until she was eventually transferred to the 7th Frigate Squadron, which was stationed in the Far East, just as the RN presence in that region was being reduced. Further duties were undertaken by Aurora across the world, but in 1987, due to defence cuts, as well as manpower shortages, a common problem for the RN at that time, Aurora was decommissioned.

Widely regarded as being among the best tragedies of the English Renaissance, the play has accumulated a large amount of critical commentary.Logan and Smith, pp. 54‚Äì55, 59‚Äì60, 263‚Äì9. The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 7 May 1622, and was first published in 1652 by the bookseller Humphrey Moseley. Authorship The title page of the first edition of The Changeling attributes the play to Middleton and Rowley. The division of authorship between the two writers was first delineated by Pauline Wiggin in 1897, and is widely accepted.Logan and Smith, pp. 71‚Äì2. David Lake, in his survey of authorship problems in the Middleton canon, summarises the standard division of shares this way:Lake, pp. 204‚Äì5. : Middleton ‚Äì Act II; Act III, scenes i, ii, and iv; Act IV, scenes i and ii; Act V, scenes i and ii; : Rowley ‚Äì Act I; Act III, scene iii; Act IV, scene iii; Act V, scene iii. Lake differs from previous commentators only in assigning the first seventeen lines of IV,ii to Rowley. The essential point of the dichotomy is that Rowley wrote the subplot and the opening and closing scenes, while Middleton was primarily responsible for the main plot‚Äîa division of labour that is unsurprising, given the examples of other Middleton‚ÄìRowley collaborations. The main plot itself derives from a 1621 story collection by John Reynolds.N. W. Bawcutt, The Changeling (1998), p. 3. Themes and Motifs The theme is the treachery that comes as a consequence of sinful human nature. The play expresses this theme through the reference of \\"original sin\\" and its consequential \\"fall\\".Levay, John. \\"Middletown And Rowley's THE CHANGELING.\\" Explicator 45.3 (1987) Subsequently, moral purity is restored after the motives of the main character are revealed.Stockton, Sharon. \\"The 'Broken Rib of Mankind': The Sociopolitical Function of the Scapegoat in the Changeling.\\" Papers on Language & Literature 26.4 (1990) The motif of faulty eyesight is used to express the theme \\"blindness shuts out the consequences of impulsive acts, and with, what amounts to an id√©e fixe, the chief characters then seek to impose their wills on an unbending and indifferent world, victimizing those equally as blind\\".Engelberg, Edward. \\"Tragic Blindness in the Changeling And Women Beware Women.\\" Modern Language Quarterly 23.1 (1962) Characters Alicante * Vermandero, governor of the castle of Alicante, father to Beatrice * Beatrice-Joanna, daughter to Vermandero * Diaphanta, her waiting-woman * Tomazo de Piracquo, a noble lord * Alonzo de Piracquo, Tomazo's brother, suitor to Beatrice * Alsemero, a nobleman, suitor to Beatrice * Jasperino, Alsemero's friend * De Flores, servant to Vermandero Asylum * Alibius, a jealous doctor * Lollio, Alibius' waiting man * Isabella, wife to Alibius * Franciscus, the counterfeit madman * Antonio, the counterfeit fool * Pedro, Antonio's friend Synopsis There are two parallel plots. The main plot in Alicante (\\"Alligant\\") focuses on Beatrice-Joanna; Alonzo, to whom she is betrothed; and Alsemero, whom she loves. To rid herself of Alonzo, Beatrice makes De Flores (who secretly loves her) murder him. This, predictably, has a tragic outcome. The sub-plot in the madhouse involves Alibius and his young wife Isabella. Franciscus and Antonio are in love with her and pretend to be a madman and a fool, respectively, to see her. Lollio also wants her. This ends comically. =Act I, scene i= Outside a church Alsemero enters from church and tells us of his love for a woman he met there. Jasperino enters from the harbour, reminding Alsemero that the \\"wind's fair\\" and that they should leave for Malta. Alsemero tells him that he is not ready to go yet. Alsemero does not give any reason to Jasperino but tells him that he wants to stay back. In truth, he wants to try to stay close to Beatrice. Beatrice enters with Diaphanta and Alsemero greets her. Alsemero had a reputation as asexual, thus Jasperino is surprised to learn that Alsemero has fallen in love with Beatrice. Jasperino watches and makes comments as Beatrice and Alsemero flirt. Alsemero proposes to Beatrice, but, in an aside, she regrets that five days ago she was promised in marriage to Alonzo de Piracquo. Her father (Vermandero) had arranged this marriage for her, although Beatrice is not at all interested in Alonzo. Instead, Beatrice is much taken by Alsemero. Alsemero waits for an answer. Jasperino resolves to get a girl for himself and sees Diaphanta. Then, De Flores enters to inform Beatrice of her father's imminent arrival. Beatrice is always repulsed by De Flores (one of the reasons being that De Flores is physically ugly) and treats him badly. However, as De Flores is besotted with Beatrice, he suffers the abuses she heaps on him just to hear her voice and see her. Beatrice tells him to go away (not only because she dislikes De Flores but also because De Flores disrupts her meeting with Alsemero); he backs off, but still watches her. Jasperino and Diaphanta begin having a conversation full of sexual innuendos. Vermandero joins Beatrice, causing her to change her behaviour. She introduces him to Alsemero; knowing the young man's father, Vermandero invites him in to see their castle. Vermandero also talks of Beatrice's fianc√©, causing her to say goodbye to Alsemero in preparation for her return home. Alsemero is heartbroken hearing talk of Beatrice's fianc√©; he plans to leave, but Vermandero insists that he stay. As they leave, Beatrice drops her glove. De Flores picks it up and offers it to her but she will not take it as she is disgusted. Beatrice exits and De Flores closes the scene with a soliloquy. =Act I, scene ii= Alibius' madhouse Alibius starts to tell Lollio a secret. The old man says he cannot satisfy his wife sexually and fears she will be disloyal to him. Therefore, he asks Lollio to guard her and lock her up. Lollio agrees, knowing that he could be left alone with Isabella and may have a chance to have sex with her. Lollio goes on to analyse the two kinds of patients in the mental asylum‚Äîfools (people who were born with mental deficiencies) and madmen (people who suffer a degradation of mental health during the course of their lives). He says that Alibius need not fear that Isabella will have sex with fools or madmen. Alibius says he is more concerned with sane tourists who come to view the patients. Antonio and Pedro enter. Pedro gives Alibius a large sum of money to take care of Antonio. Lollio hints that he wants some too and Pedro grants him his wish. Lollio says that Antonio has almost the appearance of a gentleman and he wouldn't have been able to tell Antonio was a fool. Then Pedro asks for Lollio to educate and improve the mind of Antonio (who also goes by \\"Tony,\\" a nickname associated in the Renaissance with madness). Lollio replies that he will \\"make him as wise as myself.\\" Pedro leaves, and Alibius counts the money. Lollio threatens to whip Antonio, also questioning him with short riddles. Surprisingly, Antonio provides very shrewd answers, which leads Lollio to remark that Antonio is very smart for a fool. The madmen (who are imprisoned in a different enclosure from the fools) begin shouting for food, and Alibius leaves to attend to them. Meanwhile, Lollio takes Antonio to the cells for fools. =Act II, scene i= A chamber in the castle Beatrice gives Jasperino a note for Alsemero in secret. In her soliloquy, Beatrice talks of how great Alsemero is (because she thinks that among other things Alsemero has shown sound judgement in choosing someone like Jasperino as his companion) and then how horrible Alonzo de Piracquo is. She says the only reason that she is marrying Alonzo is because her father has forced the choice on her and she cannot disobey her father. De Flores enters (having been eavesdropping on Beatrice's proclamations of love for Alsemero) but Beatrice does not see him initially while he talks of Alonzo's love for her and her hatred of him. She sees him and gets angry because he stalls from delivering his message. Eventually he says that Alonzo and Tomazo have arrived. After delivering another soliloquy, he exits. Beatrice, repelled by De Flores, says she will get her father to dismiss him. Then Vermandero, Alonzo and Tomazo enter. Vermandero attempts to be a welcoming host. While Beatrice and Vermandero talk, Tomazo tells his brother that Beatrice did not seem pleased to see him. Alonzo dismisses the remark. After Vermandero informs Alonzo that Beatrice has requested a three-day postponement of their wedding, Tomazo repeats his misgivings. He tells Alonzo not to marry Beatrice because she is in love with someone else. Alonzo refuses to listen, being madly in love and finding no faults in Beatrice. He says he does not think that she was behaving coldly with him. =Act II, scene ii= Another chamber in the castle Diaphanta leads Alsemero into a chamber secretly. She is acting on her lady's (Beatrice's) instructions. However, Diaphanta too is smitten with Alsemero. When Beatrice enters, she leaves the room unwillingly as she was enjoying being alone with Alsemero. Alsemero and Beatrice talk and embrace. They talk about how they could \\"remove the cause\\" by killing Alonzo. Alsemero declares he will challenge Piraquo to a duel (meaning Alsemero would end up dead or in jail.) Beatrice protests saying that that wouldn't actually help in uniting them but would rather further separate them physically. Beatrice, on an aside, realises that she can use De Flores to kill Alonzo. Beatrice shoves Alsemero back to Diaphanta (who is overjoyed). De Flores enters, having been hidden. De Flores realises that Beatrice will have to transgress one bond (with Alonzo) if she is to have sex with Alsemero. This acts as a kind of impetus to De Flores who thinks if she breaks a bond once, she may break it several times and even he himself might have a chance to have sex with her. Beatrice decides to flirt with him. She behaves not only civilly but also amorously with him. She promises him some medicine that will cure his bad skin. He is delighted at her apparent change of heart. She tells him she is being forced to marry a man she hates, and De Flores realises she wants him to murder Alonzo. In return, she gives him some money, and says a greater reward (by which she means more money but which De Flores assumes as an offer for sex) awaits him if he successfully completes the task. De Flores kneels before her (he is also a gentleman) and agrees readily to commit the murder, thinking he'll be able to sleep with her afterwards. Beatrice says she expects him to leave the country after the murder; she is pleased that she can get rid of De Flores and Alonzo at the same time. Beatrice exits. Alonzo enters. Alonzo asks De Flores for a tour of the castle. De Flores says he will show him around after dinner. He hides a sword in his cloak. =Act III, scene i= A narrow passage / A vault As they descend, De Flores advises that the space is very narrow so Alonzo should find it easier to walk if he leaves his sword behind. =Act III, scene ii= De Flores instructs Alonzo to look out a window. While he is doing this, De Flores stabs him three times. De Flores sees a diamond ring on the finger of the dead Alonzo. He tries to remove the diamond ring and take it for himself but he is somehow unable to remove the ring from the dead Alonzo's finger. He instead cuts off the entire finger and takes it with him. Then he clears away the body. =Act III, scene iii= Alibius' madhouse Isabella asks Lollio why she has been locked up. Lollio claims it's his master's wish so that Isabella isn't able to venture out and be sexually active with other men. Isabella complains that there are only madmen and fools in the mental asylum. Then she says that she recently saw that a very good-looking patient was admitted and requests Lollio to bring the patient to her. Lollio shows in Franciscus. Isabella asks Lollio how Franciscus went mad. Lollio replies that it was because of spurned love. Isabella remarks that Franciscus seems like a gentleman by the way he speaks. Lollio whips Franciscus for insulting him and for making advances towards Isabella. They soon realise that Franciscus is not really a madman but only pretending to be one, and Lollio puts Franciscus back in his cell. Lollio brings Antonio to meet Isabella. The madmen make noises, and Lollio goes to beat them. As he leaves, Antonio reveals to Isabella that he is only pretending to be a fool so as to be admitted into the asylum and gain access to her. Antonio tries to undress himself and have sex with Isabella but she is able to avoid it for the time being. Lollio returns to ask Antonio some questions, but leaves again as the madmen start creating a ruckus and Lollio has to manage both cells. After he leaves, Antonio begins kissing Isabella, not knowing Lollio is spying on them. Suddenly madmen dressed as birds interrupt their encounter. Lollio again goes offstage to attend to them. He comes back to return Antonio to his cell. Isabella remarks that one need not go out of the house to seek sexual escapades. Lollio then challenges Isabella about Antonio and tries to sexually molest Isabella in return for keeping it a secret. Alibius enters, oblivious to the conversation, and tells them that Vermandero has invited him to make his patients perform (simply as madmen) at Beatrice's wedding. =Act III, scene iv= A chamber in the castle Vermandero, Beatrice, Jasperino, and Alsemero enter; only Vermandero does not know about Beatrice and Alsemero. They all leave to look around the castle, except Beatrice. Beatrice says that she's starting to convince her father to like Alsemero. De Flores enters with the intention of having sex with Beatrice, thinking this is what she wants too. He tells Beatrice that \\"Piracquo is no more\\" and then shows her the finger with the diamond ring. Beatrice says it was the first token that Vermandero made her send to Alonzo. Beatrice asks De Flores to take the ring as it is worth three hundred ducats, then on seeing the fact that De Flores is disappointed, offers another three thousand florins. De Flores is disgusted at the idea of murdering for money; he murdered for the reward of having sex with Beatrice. Beatrice offers to double the amount, but is confused about why De Flores will not leave contented with money, assuming that the amount he wants is much too high to actually announce out loud. She thus suggests he goes out of the country (as she had told him earlier) and send her the amount he wants on paper. He replies that if he leaves, she must too, since they are bound together in guilt. De Flores kisses her in a last-ditch attempt to seal their love, but Beatrice rejects him with disgust. De Flores explains in meticulous detail exactly why she has to submit to him, mainly that he can now effectively blackmail her or else he will inform everyone how she hired him to murder Alonzo. He says that his life is worth nothing if he cannot have her, and therefore is willing to incriminate himself if she does not sleep with him. She tries to impress on him the difference in their social class, but he claims that her evil act has made them equals. She makes one last effort to offer him all her gold, but again he refuses. She eventually realises the vicious cycle of sin that she has entered. =Act IV, scene i= Dumb Show Various gentlemen enter, Vermandero meeting them, wondering over the flight of Alonzo. Alsemero, Jasperino and the Gallants enter. Vermandero points to the Gallants, the gentlemen seeming to applaud the choice. Beatrice, in her wedding dress, enters. She is accompanied with Diaphanta, Isabella, and other women. De Flores enters last, smiling at the \\"accident\\"; Alonzo's ghost appears to De Flores in the midst of his smile, startling him, and shows him the hand whose finger he had cut off. Beatrice has yielded to De Flores's sexual demands, and has also married Alsemero. Alone in the afternoon in Alsemero's room, she feels too ashamed to have sex with her new husband on their wedding night. In Alsemero's closet, she finds many medicines. One is a pregnancy test kit and another a virginity test kit. Diaphanta enters, looking for Alsemero. Beatrice tells Diaphanta that she will offer 1000 ducats to any virgin if she secretly has sex with her husband Alsemero, instead of her, on their wedding night. But to test whether Diaphanta is a virgin or not, both of them take the virginity test. The virginity test shows that Beatrice is not a virgin whereas Diaphanta is, as she has exhibited the usual symptoms of first yawning, then sneezing, and finally laughing. They arrange for Diaphanta to go to Alsemero's bed that night, in the pitch darkness, and pretend to be Beatrice. =Act IV, scene ii= Vermandero finds that two of his gentlemen, Antonio and Franciscus, have left the castle. He issues arrest warrants for them, believing they have murdered Alonzo and fled. Tomazo enters, accusing Vermandero of killing his brother. Vermandero pretends that Alonzo has just run away and it is he, Vermandero, who should actually be offended that his future son-in-law has run away at the last moment. Vermandero says Tomazo should leave too, as he is the brother of an ignoble coward like Alonzo. Vermandero exits. De Flores enters, and Tomazo greets him warmly, remembering that his brother Alonzo was fond of De Flores. Tomazo even goes on to say that whereas Vermandero is not trustworthy, De Flores is a trustworthy gentleman. All this talk reminds De Flores of Tomazo's brother Alonzo whom he killed. De Flores exits. Alsemero enters and Tomazo is hostile towards him. Tomazo challenges Alsemero to a duel after the wedding. Tomazo exits, Jasperino runs in. Jasperino tells Alsemero that he heard Beatrice and De Flores having a conversation similar to one lovers might have. Alsemero instructs Jasperino to go and get the virginity test. Beatrice enters just before Jasperino returns. Alsemero thinks Beatrice looks very different and must have been abused. Alsemero gives Beatrice the potion, and she drinks it, then fakes the symptoms thereby \\"proving\\" to Alsemero and Jasperino that she is a virgin. =Act IV, scene iii= Lollio and Isabella read a letter in which Franciscus declares that he is only pretending to be a madman to gain access to Isabella and that he is in love with her. Lollio says that if Isabella has sex with Franciscus, then he wants to have sex with her too. Isabella says that if she indeed does commit adultery, she will sleep with him, implying that she has no intention of committing adultery. She asks Lollio how to deal with Antonio and Franciscus's attraction to her, and he advises her to abuse them. To that end, she leaves to dress as a madwoman. Alibius arrives and asks about the wedding. Alibius then asks how Isabella is getting on. Lollio assures him she is fine and he exits. Antonio enters, and Lollio forces him to dance. Lollio exits, and Isabella enters in her new clothes as a madwoman. Isabella attempts to kiss him but Antonio resists, unable to recognise Isabella and disgusted at the idea of being kissed by a madwoman. Antonio confesses that he is no fool but just a gentleman pretending to be a fool. Isabella denounces him for loving her external appearance only. She exits, and Lollio enters, telling Antonio that if he kills Franciscus, he can have sex with Isabella. Franciscus enters, and Lollio reads the letter he wrote to Isabella. Lollio tells him that if he kills Antonio, Isabella will have sex with him. Alibius enters, and Lollio goes to fetch the madmen. All the madmen dance for the wedding. =Act V, scene i= It is 2 a.m. and Diaphanta has not yet come out of Alsemero's chamber, even though Beatrice had instructed her to finish by midnight. Therefore, Beatrice suspects that Diaphanta is actually enjoying having sex with Alsemero. This leads her to suspect that it must have been Diaphanta who had informed Alsemero of Beatrice's loss of virginity (as Diaphanta may have had a chance to figure out that what she and Beatrice indulged in were virginity tests). This leads to Beatrice getting very angry with Diaphanta. De Flores enters. Beatrice is worried that if Diaphanta does not come out before daybreak, Alsemero will be able to see with whom he has had sex with and will recognise his mistake and Beatrice's plot will be ruined. De Flores comes up with an idea to get Diaphanta out of the room. He says that he will set Diaphanta's chambers on fire and that will wake up the entire house and when Diaphanta returns to her room then De Flores will pretend that he will clean the chimney with a gun but he will kill her with it. Beatrice agrees, even suggesting that she now loves De Flores. Alonzo's ghost appears again and haunts De Flores and Beatrice. De Flores lights the fire, offstage, then leads the group of residents who attempt to douse it. Diaphanta appears, and Beatrice tells her to return to her chamber. Vermandero enters, followed by Alsemero and Jasperino. The gunshot is heard, signifying Diaphanta's murder. De Flores returns to the stage, heroically carrying Diaphanta's burnt body from the fire. De Flores is promised financial reward by Vermandero and others for his bravery in alerting everyone to the fire and thereby preventing further damage. =Act V, scene ii= Tomazo, in a sudden fit of misanthropy, decides to blame the next person he sees for the death of his brother (since he holds everyone potentially accountable). De Flores enters. Tomazo becomes enraged. He reiterates Beatrice's earlier misgivings about using something that has also been used by De Flores. He says that if his sword were to touch De Flores once, he would not use that sword again, and strikes him. De Flores draws his sword as though to retaliate, but is forcibly reminded of Alonzo's murder, and cannot bring himself to strike. De Flores is unnerved by Tomazo's sudden, intuitive hostility, and leaves hastily. Alibius and Isabella enter with Vermandero. Tomazo tells them to go away. Vermandero informs Tomazo that he has found Alonzo's murderers‚ÄîAntonio and Franciscus, who were hiding in a mental asylum after committing the murder. =Act V, scene iii= Jasperino and Alsemero have seen Beatrice and De Flores together in a garden and are discussing it. Beatrice enters, Jasperino hides. Alsemero accuses Beatrice of being a liar and a whore, and suggests that she's been cheating with De Flores. She confesses that she employed De Flores to murder Alonzo, but explains that she did it out of love for Alsemero, because her first motive was to remove Alonzo so that she and Alsemero could be together. Alsemero says he must think about what to do, and locks Beatrice in a closet to wait. De Flores enters, and Alsemero gets him to admit to murder. De Flores, under the impression that Beatrice is attempting to betray and outmanoeuvre him, exposes her infidelity. Alsemero confines him in the closet with Beatrice. Vermandero, Alibius, Isabella, Tomazo, and Franciscus enter, thinking they have solved the case of Alonzo's murder. Alsemero also claims he has solved Alonzo's murder. As Alsemero begins to reveal the truth, screams of pleasure and of pain are heard within the room, and the pair comes out, Beatrice stabbed by De Flores. Beatrice confesses her fallen state and also that she sent Diaphanta in her place to the bedroom to have sex with Alsemero. De Flores admits to killing Alonzo, stabs himself, and dies before Tomazo can seek revenge. With his last words, De Flores instructs Beatrice to follow him in death, and as she dies, Beatrice asks Alsemero for forgiveness. They speak about changes and changelings. Alsemero says Beatrice was beauty changed to whoredom, he himself a supposed husband changed with wantonness. Antonio says he was changed from a little ass to a great fool and was almost changed to be hanged at the gallows. Franciscus says he was changed from a little wit to stark mad. Alibius says he realises his folly and will change himself and never keep fake patients. =Epilogue= The epilogue is a mere eight lines in which Alsemero explains that it is impossible to comfort people after they have lost a person close to them. The only solution is for that person to be replaced, the implication being that the audience must applaud for this \\"replacement\\" to occur. Film, television and stage adaptations In 1974, as part of Play of the Month, the BBC broadcast a production directed by Anthony Page and starring Stanley Baker as De Flores, Helen Mirren as Beatrice-Joanna, Brian Cox as Alsemero, Tony Selby as Jasperino and Susan Penhaligon as Isabella. This is available on DVD in the Helen Mirren at the BBC box set. In 1994, a version directed by Simon Curtis removed the madhouse subplot and was broadcast by the BBC starring Elizabeth McGovern as Beatrice-Joanna, Bob Hoskins as De Flores, Hugh Grant as Alsemero and Sean Pertwee as Tomazo. It was broadcast in the United States on the BRAVO cable television network. A 1998 film version directed by Marcus Thompson starred Guy Williams as Alonso, Amanda Ray-King as Beatrice-Joanna, Ian Dury as De Flores and Colm O'Maonlai as Alsemero. Notable stage performances have included the 1988 National Theatre production starring Miranda Richardson as Beatrice-Joanna and George Harris as De Flores. A 2009 ITV television tragedy, Compulsion, is loosely based on The Changeling. In 2012 the play returned for a new version at London's Young Vic theatre. The actors doubled up roles for the main and sub plot, such as Diaphanta and Isabella. In 2014 Dominic Dromgoole directed the play in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at the Globe Theatre, recreating the performance with the sole use of candlelight for the performance. In 2016 Jesse Berger directed the play Off-Broadway at Red Bull Theater, in a production which featured Manoel Felciano and Sara Topham. https://www.redbulltheater.com/the-changeling Between June 2016 and June 2017 the play was mounted four times in or around the city of Toronto, first in a text adapted by Julian R. Munds, Changeling: A Grand Guignol for Murderous times (dir. Harrison Thomas); then by James Wallis, as The Changeling: A Staged Reading, for his production company Shakespeare BASH'd; then in association with the Stratford Festival of Canada and the School of Performance at Ryerson University, by Paul Yachnin, a professor of English at McGill University, for Early Modern Conversions; and finally by the Stratford Festival, as a full production at the Tom Patterson Theatre (dir. Jackie Maxwell), starring Mikaela Davies and Ben Carlson. In 2019, a small-scale tour was mounted by Resurgens Theatre Company, an original practice company led by Dr. Brent Griffin in association with the Atlanta Shakespeare Tavern. The tour was designed for educational audiences and performed in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. In 2020 during the UK COVID-19 Lockdown, a Radio Production of the play was created remotely over Zoom, by the graduation year of the Guildford School of Acting, Actor Musician Course. The class composed and recorded the Soundtrack themselves as well. The production was directed by Tam Williams, and Musical Direction and Sound Editing was overseen by Paul Herbert.

The novel was later adapted into a 1922 silent film in which Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino (credited as Rodolph Valentino) starred together for the only time. The film was directed by Sam Wood and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The novel's title comes from a conversation in Chapter 4 about the nature of Fate, where the main character expresses belief that \\"if one does one's best some kind angel will guide one's bark [on the river of life] past the rocks and safely into the smooth waters of the pool beyond.\\" Frequently thereafter, the characters long for angels who will steer them \\"beyond the rocks.\\" Plot The beautiful young Theodora Fitzgerald belongs to a family of noble lineage whose fortunes have waned and who have lived in near poverty for most of her life. The book begins with her arranged marriage to Josiah Brown, a nouveau- riche Australian in his fifties. The marriage was contracted for convenience: Josiah simply wants a pretty and aristocratic wife to improve his standing in society, and the Fitzgerald family are in need of Brown's financial resources. Theodora only agrees to the marriage for the sake of her father and sisters. Immediately after the wedding, Josiah falls ill. Theodora proves a dutiful and capable wife, and attends to her husband's every need, though she is secretly very unhappy. After a year of marriage, Josiah is well enough to visit Paris, where Theodora sees her father, Dominic, again for the first time since her wedding. She is thrilled to observe that at least he is receiving all the benefits she'd hoped to bring from her sacrifice: he now runs in aristocratic circles and is courting a wealthy American widow, Mrs. McBride. Theodora attends several social outings with her father, and at one dinner is introduced to Hector, Lord Bracondale. Theodora and Hector hit things off splendidly, and soon fall in love. Mrs. McBride is aware of Theodora's unhappy marriage, and seeing the situation she sympathetically arranges for Hector and Theodora to spend time together as often as possible. One day while Theodora and Hector are being chauffeured back to Paris after an outing at Versailles, the two indulge in a romantic encounter in the back of the car. Full of guilt thereafter, the two conclude they must behave themselves from now on and must no longer pursue each other romantically; they will, however, continue to be friendly to one another any time future social obligations might cause them to meet. Hector at this point is terribly in love with Theodora, and though he tries his best to live by his promise to her, he still goes out of his way to see her and to secure invitations to all the same gatherings that she attends. He fantasizes about marrying her and makes sure to introduce her to his mother and to his sister. However, Theodora's status as a newcomer into society, and the obvious favour that Hector pays her over other eligible women who desire his hand, causes ire and jealousy to be directed her way. Rumors begin to spread, and several people believe Hector and Theodora to be lovers. Morella Winmarleigh, a spurned candidate for Hector's hand, particularly sets out destroy Theodora. She maliciously switches a letter Theodora had written to Hector with another letter meant for Josiah. Meanwhile, without anyone else's knowledge, Theodora and Hector have concluded that they cannot attempt to remain friends any longer‚Äîtheir love is too strong‚Äîand so they must agree to never see each other again. The next day, Josiah receives Theodora's letter meant for Hector: the contents amount to Theodora asking Hector never to see her again, even though the two of them could be very happy together, because it is her duty to instead attend to the happiness of her husband Josiah. Josiah realises for the first time how he has stood in the way of Theodora's happiness, and resolves to do his best to make her happy from now on. He forwards the letter to Hector and requests he never allow Theodora to learn of the mix-up. The next several months pass with Theodora and Josiah both trying their best to make the other happy, even while both are secretly miserable. Both begin to suffer from ill health. Ultimately, Josiah dies; eighteen months later, Mrs. McBride (now married to Dominic Fitzgerald) throws a picnic at Versailles to which both Theodora and Hector are invited. The book ends with the couple reunited, in a state of \\"passionate love and delirious happiness.\\"  Publicity  The novel was republished in 1922 in an edition by The Macaulay Company which included \\"illustrations from the Paramount Photo-Play\\" of Valentino and Swanson.

It is traditional for burials in the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions, among others. In most cases, it has the deceased's name, date of birth, and date of death inscribed on it, along with a personal message, or prayer, but may contain pieces of funerary art, especially details in stone relief. In many parts of Europe, insetting a photograph of the deceased in a frame is very common.  Use  Marble headstone of a couple buried together in Singapore, showing an arched emblem, signifying the reunification with one's partner in heaven. Within the arch is a statue of Jesus Christ The stele (plural stelae), as it is called in an archaeological context, is one of the oldest forms of funerary art. Originally, a tombstone was the stone lid of a stone coffin, or the coffin itself, and a gravestone was the stone slab that was laid over a grave. Now, all three terms are also used for markers placed at the head of the grave. Some graves in the 18th century also contained footstones to demarcate the foot end of the grave. This sometimes developed into full kerb sets that marked the whole perimeter of the grave. Footstones were rarely annotated with more than the deceased's initials and year of death, and sometimes a memorial mason and plot reference number. Many cemeteries and churchyards have removed those extra stones to ease grass cutting by machine mower. In some UK cemeteries, the principal, and indeed only, marker is placed at the foot of the grave. Owing to soil movement and downhill creep on gentle slopes, older headstones and footstones can often be found tilted at an angle. Over time, this movement can result in the stones being sited several metres away from their original location. Graves and any related memorials are a focus for mourning and remembrance. The names of relatives are often added to a gravestone over the years, so that one marker may chronicle the passing of an entire family spread over decades. Since gravestones and a plot in a cemetery or churchyard cost money, they are also a symbol of wealth or prominence in a community. Some gravestones were even commissioned and erected to their own memory by people who were still living, as a testament to their wealth and status. In a Christian context, the very wealthy often erected elaborate memorials within churches rather than having simply external gravestones. Crematoria frequently offer similar alternatives to families who do not have a grave to mark, but who want a focus for their mourning and for remembrance. Carved or cast commemorative plaques inside the crematorium for example may serve this purpose.  Materials  A cemetery may follow national codes of practice or independently prescribe the size and use of certain materials, especially in a conservation area. Some may limit the placing of a wooden memorial to six months after burial, after which a more permanent memorial must be placed. Others may require stones of a certain shape or position to facilitate grass-cutting. Headstones of granite, marble and other kinds of stone are usually created, installed, and repaired by monumental masons. Cemeteries require regular inspection and maintenance, as stones may settle, topple and, on rare occasions, fall and injure people;Memorial safety or graves may simply become overgrown and their markers lost or vandalised. Restoration is a specialized job for a monumental mason. Even overgrowth removal requires care to avoid damaging the carving. For example, ivy should only be cut at the base roots and left to naturally die off, never pulled off forcefully. Many materials have been used as markers. =Stone= * Fieldstones. In many cultures markers for graves other than enclosed areas, such as planted with characteristic plants particularly in northern Europe the yew, were natural fieldstones, some unmarked and others decorated or incised using a metal awl. Typical motifs for the carving included a symbol and the deceased's name and age. * Granite. Granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Modern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and sandblasting over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers and emblems exposed on the stone, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph. * Marble and limestone. Both limestone and marble take carving well. Marble is a recrystallised form of limestone. The mild acid in rainwater can slowly dissolve marble and limestone over time, which can make inscriptions unreadable. Portland stone was a type of limestone commonly used in England‚Äîafter weathering, fossiliferous deposits tend to appear on the surface. Marble became popular from the early 19th century, though its extra cost limited its appeal. * Sandstone. Sandstone is durable, yet soft enough to carve easily. Some sandstone markers are so well preserved that individual chisel marks are discernible, while others have delaminated and crumbled to dust. Delamination occurs when moisture gets between the layers of the sandstone. As it freezes and expands the layers flake off. In the 17th century, sandstone replaced field stones in Colonial America. Yorkstone was a common sandstone material used in England. * Slate. Slate can have a pleasing texture but is slightly porous and prone to delamination. It takes lettering well, often highlighted with white paint or gilding.

Wooden grave markers stored at Heidal Church, Norway * Iron. Iron grave markers and decorations were popular during the Victorian era in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, often being produced by specialist foundries or the local blacksmith. Cast iron headstones have lasted for generations while wrought ironwork often only survives in a rusted or eroded state. In eastern V√§rmland, Sweden, iron crosses instead of stones have been popular since the 18th century. * White bronze. Actually sand cast zinc, but called white bronze for marketing purposes. Almost all, if not all, zinc grave markers were made by the Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, CT, between 1874 and 1914. The company set up subsidiaries in Detroit, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Des Moines; a Chicago subsidiary was named the American Bronze Company, while the St. Thomas White Bronze Monument Company was set up in Ontario, Canada. They are in cemeteries of the period all across the U.S. and Canada. They were sold as more durable than marble, about 1/3 less expensive and progressive. * Wood. This was a popular material during the Georgian and Victorian era, and almost certainly before, in Great Britain and elsewhere. Some could be very ornate, although few survive beyond 50‚Äì100 years due to natural decomposition or termites and other wood boring insects. * Planting. Trees or shrubs, particularly roses, may be planted, especially to mark the location of ashes. This may be accompanied by a small inscribed metal or wooden marker.  Inscriptions  Markers sometimes bear inscriptions. The information on the headstone generally includes the name of the deceased and their date of birth and death. Such information can be useful to genealogists and local historians. Larger cemeteries may require a discreet reference code as well to help accurately fix the location for maintenance. The cemetery owner, church, or, as in the UK, national guidelines might encourage the use of 'tasteful' and accurate wording in inscriptions. The placement of inscriptions is traditionally placed on the forward-facing side of the memorial but can also be seen in some cases on the reverse and around the edges of the stone itself. Some families request that an inscription be made on the portion of the memorial that will be underground. In addition, some gravestones also bear epitaphs in praise of the deceased or quotations from religious texts, such as \\"requiescat in pace\\". In a few instances the inscription is in the form of a plea, admonishment, testament of faith, claim to fame or even a curse‚ÄîWilliam Shakespeare's inscription famously declares > Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, To dig the dust enclos√®d here. Blest > be the man that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones. Or a warning about mortality, such as this Persian poetry carved on an ancient tombstone in the Tajiki capital of Dushanbe.Robert Fisk: \\"An urge to smash history into tiny pieces\\" The Independent, 8 September 2007 Gravestone in Canada with indigenous language inscription in Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics > I heard that mighty Jamshed the King Carved on a stone near a spring of > water these words: : \\"Many‚Äîlike us‚Äîsat here by this spring : And left this > life in the blink of an eye. : We captured the whole world through our > courage and strength, : Yet could take nothing with us to our grave.\\" Or a simpler warning of inevitability of death: Hebrew inscriptions on gravestones in Sobƒõdruhy. > Remember me as you pass by, As you are now, so once was I, As I am now, so > you will be, Prepare for death and follow me. Multilingual gravestone: Welsh, English, French Gurkha soldier's stone in Singapore Serbian women's stone in Gornja Gorevnica, Serbia. Information in English, Bible verse in German (Dallas, TX) Headstone engravers faced their own \\"year 2000 problem\\" when still-living people, as many as 500,000 in the United States alone, pre-purchased headstones with pre-carved death years beginning with 19‚Äì. Bas-relief carvings of a religious nature or of a profile of the deceased can be seen on some headstones, especially up to the 19th century. Since the invention of photography, a gravestone might include a framed photograph or cameo of the deceased; photographic images or artwork (showing the loved one, or some other image relevant to their life, interests or achievements) are sometimes now engraved onto smooth stone surfaces. Some headstones use lettering made of white metal fixed into the stone, which is easy to read but can be damaged by ivy or frost. Deep carvings on a hard- wearing stone may weather many centuries exposed in graveyards and still remain legible. Those fixed on the inside of churches, on the walls, or on the floor (often as near the altar as possible) may last much longer: such memorials were often embellished with a monumental brass. The choice of language and/or script on gravestones has been studied by sociolinguists as indicators of language choices and language loyalty. For example, by studying cemeteries used by immigrant communities,Doris Francis, Georgina Neophytu, Leonie Kellaher. 2005. The Secret Cemetery. Oxford: Berg. some languages were found to be carved \\"long after the language ceased to be spoken\\" in the communities.p. 42. Kara VanDam. 2009. Dutch- American language shift: evidence from the grave. LACUS Forum XXXIV 33-42. In other cases, a language used in the inscription may indicate a religious affiliation. Marker inscriptions have also been used for political purposes, such as the grave marker installed in January 2008 at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky by Mathew Prescott, an employee of PETA. The grave marker is located near the grave of KFC founder Harland Sanders and bears the acrostic message \\"KFC tortures birds\\". The group placed its grave marker to promote its contention that KFC is cruel to chickens.  Form and decoration  equestrian motif on an 11th-century Swedish gravestone. Islamic cemetery in Sarajevo, with columnar headstones Gravestones may be simple upright slabs with semi-circular, rounded, gabled, pointed-arched, pedimental, square or other shaped tops. During the 18th century, they were often decorated with memento mori (symbolic reminders of death) such as skulls or winged skulls, winged cherub heads, heavenly crowns, urns or the picks and shovels of the gravedigger. Somewhat unusual were more elaborate allegorical figures, such as Old Father Time, or emblems of trade or status, or even some event from the life of the deceased (particularly how they died). Large tomb chests, false sarcophagi as the actual remains were in the earth below, or smaller coped chests were commonly used by the gentry as a means of commemorating a number of members of the same family. In the 19th century, headstone styles became very diverse, ranging from plain to highly decorated, and often using crosses on a base or other shapes differing from the traditional slab. They might be replaced by more elaborately carved markers, such as crosses or angels. Simple curb surrounds, sometimes filled with glass chippings, were popular during the mid-20th century. Islamic headstones are traditionally more a rectangular upright shaft, often topped with a carved topknot symbolic of a turban; but in Western countries more local styles are often used. Some form of simple decoration may be employed. Special emblems on tombstones indicate several familiar themes in many faiths. Some examples are: * Anchor: Steadfast hope * Angel of grief: Sorrow * Arch: Rejoined with partner in Heaven * Birds: The soul * Book: Faith, wisdom * Cherub: Divine wisdom or justice * Column: Noble life * Broken column: Early death * Conch shell: Wisdom * Cross, anchor and Bible: Trials, victory and reward * Crown: Reward and glory * Dolphin: Salvation, bearer of souls to Heaven * Dove: Purity, love and Holy Spirit * Evergreen: Eternal life * Garland: Victory over death * Gourds: Deliverance from grief * Hands: A relation or partnership (see Reference 3) * Heart: Devotion * Horseshoe: Protection against evil * Hourglass: Time and its swift flight * IHS: Stylized version of iota-eta-sigma, a Greek abbreviation of \\"Iesus Hominum Salvator\\" (\\"Jesus, savior of mankind\\"); alternatively treated as an initialism for \\"in Hoc Signo (Vinces)\\": \\"In this sign you shall conquer.\\" Commonly indicates Roman Catholic faith, the latter especially Society of Jesus. * Ivy: Faithfulness, memory, and undying friendship * Lamb: Innocence, young age * Lamp: Immortality * Laurel: Victory, fame * Lily: Purity and resurrection * Lion: Strength, resurrection * Mermaid: Dualism of Christ‚Äîfully God, fully man * Oak: Strength * Olive branch: Forgiveness, and peace * Palms: Martyrdom, or victory over death * Peacock: Eternal life * Pillow: a deathbed, eternal sleep * Poppy: Eternal sleep * Rooster: Awakening, courage and vigilance * Shell: Birth and resurrection * Skeleton: Life's brevity * Snake in a circle: Everlasting life in Heaven * Square and Compasses: Freemasonry * Star of David: Judaism * Swallow: Motherhood * Broken sword: Life cut short * Crossed swords: Life lost in battle * Torch: Eternal life if upturned, death if extinguished * Tree trunk: The beauty of life * Triangle: Truth, equality and the trinity * Tzedakah box (pushke): Righteousness, for it is written \\"...to do righteousness and justice\\" (Gen 18:19) and \\"the doing of righteousness and justice is preferable to the Lord than sacrificial offering\\" (Proverbs 21:3). * Shattered urn: Old age, mourning if draped * Weeping willow: Mourning, grief Greek letters might also be used: * \\\\alpha \\\\omega (alpha and omega): The beginning and the end * \\\\chi \\\\rho (chi rho): The first letters spelling the name of Christ  Safety  Over time a headstone may settle or its fixings weaken. After several instances where unstable stones have fallen in dangerous circumstances, some burial authorities \\"topple test\\" headstones by firm pressure to check for stability. They may then tape them off or flatten them. This procedure has proved controversial in the UK, where an authority's duty of care to protect visitors is complicated because it often does not have any ownership rights over the dangerous marker. Authorities that have knocked over stones during testing or have unilaterally lifted and laid flat any potentially hazardous stones have been criticised, after grieving relatives have discovered that their relative's marker has been moved.National Federation of Cemetery Friends Safety in cemeteries guidance Since 2007 Consistory Court and local authority guidance now restricts the force used in a topple test and requires an authority to consult relatives before moving a stone.

It is named after five small islands ‚Äì Moose, Diamond, Long, Egg, and Pinnacle ‚Äì located just off the coast. The islands are an exposed part of the North Mountain Basalt. Moose Island is in Colchester County. The remaining islands are in Cumberland County. Beyond Pinnacle Island is a seastack called Pinnacle Rock. The Five Islands Provincial Park includes Moose and Diamond Islands. Five Islands had a lighthouse in operation from 1914 to 1999. It was moved several times due to erosion. The lighthouse has since been preserved by a community group. Native Mi'kmaq legend has it that the Five Islands were created when their god Glooscap threw the mud, sticks and stones at the giant beaver who dammed his medicine garden in Advocate. The mud, sticks and stones that formed the islands are said to have trapped the beaver in one of the islands and turned it into gold. Economy The main sources of income in Five Islands are from natural resources including blueberries, fishing, and clam harvesting and processing. Tourism is also important, with several restaurants and campgrounds in the area. In the late 1800s there was a large barite mine, (called \\"barytes\\" at the time by the locals) on the Bass River called the Duncan/Eureka Mine. The barite was used in the Henderson & Potts (later Brandram-Henderson) Paint Factory, located in Lower Five Islands. Later, barite was shipped to Halifax and the United States for its use in paint manufacturing. View from Old Wife Point, Five Islands Provincial Park, to the southeast, down the southwestern foot of Economy Mountain. Moose Island Seniors living in the community recall youthful memories of Moose Island deriving its name from stories of the island having supported a moose herd until shortly after settlers inhabited the surrounding areas. There are other legends relating to this island as well but this seems to be the most laudable to many who have lived there many years ago. Moose Island was the only one of the five ever to be inhabited and carries with it the most tangible tale of intrigue. Early in the 1800s, John Ruff, a Scotsman, settled this outpost with his family. He cleared much of the forest and established a modest mixed farm, supplying the coastal village with produce, wood and charcoal. He was reputed to be a hard, cruel person, and rumors circulated that he abused his wife and children. When he died a violent death, suspicions arose that he had been murdered by his son. A controversial trial led to acquittal, and afterwards the family moved to the mainland, carrying the unresolved mystery with them. Legend has John Ruff's spirit stalking the long overgrown fields during misty, moonless nights in search of vengeance. On a dark night on the beach, some people have said that they could see a light that walks the shore of the island. Diamond Island There is a podcast talking about Five Islands and the myths around Diamond Island here.. Long Island In 2003 Long Island was purchased by Dick Lemon, who wanted to build on its top, above the sea bed, a retreat for artists, writers, musicians and academics.Graham, Janna. \\"Not since Moses?\\". The Truro Daily News. June 6, 2007. The cliffs prohibited access except by a rope assisted scramble up a muddy draw. The sea, being in the Bay of Fundy's tide reach, is deep at high tide and empty at low tide, so boat access to the island is limited each day to a four-hour window, namely the high tide during daylight. When the tide is low, people on Long Island can walk or run on the sea bed for miles. Taking advantage of the extreme tides, Lemon in 2007 began a charity event called Not Since Moses, a 5K and 10K run from Long and Moose Islands through the sea bed to shore.Race Website Meanwhile, beginning in 2004, local workers began creating a retreat on Long Island. A helicopter carried heavy equipment including a tent for workers to live in during the construction (since they could not practically travel daily to and from the island). Then, to begin, locals hung from the cliffs and pounded in supports for 194 steps rising from the sea to the island's top. A lift was designed by Dennis Ross, the project manager, who had retired as a corrections officer at the nearby prison in Springhill. The locally built lift ultimately hauled 25 tons of gravel, about of lumber, and another 20 tons of furniture and furnishings and all else needed for a three bedroom two bath main house plus four sleeping cabins.Travel Blog These include a miniature lighthouse, a cabin built in the shape of a river boat edged over a cliff, a perch cabin on a promontory and a caretakers cabin. Ross oversaw the construction, the drilling with a specialty rig of two wells and the installation of a solar and generator power system for the main house which enjoys all the comforts of a modern home including full kitchen. The retreat is used May through October by users such as the Nova Scotia College of Arts and Design, Ships Company Theatre, St. Mary's University and various groups which have included private tourists. During the night of 19 October 2015, the hole that had been in Long Island collapsed. Egg Island Pinnacle Island Pinnacle Island is home to a colony of gulls. Geology The islands and the park are composed of basalt resting on top of Triassic age sandstone. The boundary between the two formations runs through the islands. Moose and Pinnacle show both sandstone and basalt, Diamond and Long are all basalt, and Egg is all sandstone. The basalts contain minerals that are interesting to rockhounds including agate, zeolites such as stilbite and gmelinite, and calcite. On the mainland, slightly inland from the community, the land rises quickly. This is the Cobequid Fault. Barite and calcite are found in some of the ravines.

Located at the western end of the Rosslyn-Ballston corridor, Ballston is a major transportation hub and boasts one of the nation's highest concentrations of scientific research agencies, including the Office of Naval Research, the Virginia Tech Advanced Research Institute and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. History Ballston is named after the Ball family, one of whose family cemeteries lies in the neighborhood at N. Stafford Street and Fairfax Drive (Virginia State Route 237). Ballston began as Birch's Crossroads and later became Ball's Crossroads at what is now the intersection of N. Glebe Road (Virginia State Route 120) and Wilson Boulevard. A historical marker that stands near the southeastern corner of the intersection reads: > This intersection has been a focal point since about 1740, when two roads > were developed, one from the future site of Alexandria to the mouth of > Pimmit Run, the other from Awbury‚Äôs Ferry (at the site of Rosslyn) to The > Falls Church. The first came to be known as the Glebe Road because it passed > the glebe of Fairfax Parish and in order to distinguish it from other roads > to the Falls. The second was eventually named Wilson Boulevard in honor of > President Wilson. The intersection became known as Ball‚Äôs Crossroads when > Ball‚Äôs Tavern was established here in the early 1800s. In 1896, an interurban electric trolley line, the Fairfax line of the Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railway (WA&FC;), began operating north of the crossroads along the present route of Fairfax Drive, whose name derives from that of the trolleys' final destination, Fairfax City. Construction of the trolley line, which branched at Clarendon to serve both Rosslyn and downtown Washington, D.C., temporarily shifted much of the area's development away from the crossroads. A historical marker that stands near the northwestern corner of Fairfax Drive and N. Stafford Street, one block east of the Ballston Metrorail station (which is at the former site of the Ballston trolley station) states: Ballston Historical Marker (2013) > By 1900 a well-defined village called Central Ballston had developed in the > area bounded by the present-day Wilson Boulevard, Taylor Street, Washington > Boulevard, and Pollard Street.

In 1912, a competing interurban electric trolley line, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway constructed a branch that crossed the WA&FC; near the west end of Ballston (then called Lacey), near a WA&FC; car barn and railyard. Interstate 66 and the Bluemont Junction Trail now follow the route of this railroad branch between Rosslyn and the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Trail in Bluemont Park. A historical marker entitled \\"Lacey Car Barn\\" located near the northwest corner of N. Glebe Road and Faifax Drive states: > In 1896, the Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Railway began running > electric trolleys from Rosslyn to Falls Church on the present routes of > Fairfax Drive and I-66. By 1907, the Fairfax trolley linked Fairfax, Vienna, > and Ballston with downtown Washington.

The Fairfax trolley closed in 1939, but > Metrorail‚Äôs Orange Line follows its route through Arlington. In 1951, the Parkington Shopping Center opened at the intersection formerly known as Balls Crossroads, on the site of the present Ballston Quarter. Parkington was anchored by the headquarters location of the Hecht Company and was reputed to have the largest parking garage in the U.S. when it opened. Ballston began to redevelop rapidly after the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority opened the Orange Line's Ballston Metrorail station on December 1, 1979 and when an entrance to Interstate 66 (I-66) opened on December 22, 1982.(1) (2) Now highly urbanized, Ballston contains highrise apartment, condominium and commercial buildings and a number of bars and restaurants.

Edward Andrews (October 9, 1914 ‚Äì March 8, 1985) was an American stage, film and television actor. Andrews was one of the most recognizable character actors on television and films from the 1950s into the 1980s. His stark white hair, imposing build and horn-rimmed glasses added to the type of roles he received, as he was often cast as an ornery boss, a cagey businessman, or other officious types.  Life and career  Andrews was born in Griffin, Georgia, the son of an Episcopal minister, and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cleveland, Ohio and Wheeling, West Virginia. As a child, he attended Pittsburgh's Nixon Theatre and would nab a balcony seat so as to catch a good view of the 'headliners'. At the age of twelve, he did a walk-on in a stock theatre production which featured James Gleason and he was 'hooked' on an acting career. He attended the University of Virginia, and at age 21, made his stage debut in 1935, progressing to Broadway the same year. During this period, Andrews starred in the short-lived but very well-received military drama So Proudly We Hail in the lead role opposite Richard Cromwell. In 1936, Andrews debuted in the film Rushin' Art. In 1949 he made a brief, uncredited appearance as a neighbor to David Wayne in Adam's Rib. However, it was not until 1955 that he appeared in his third film. He was cast as the subversive and corrupt character of Rhett Tanner, head of a knock-them-off political machine, in The Phenix City Story. This was soon followed by roles in other 1950s films, such as The Harder They Fall (1956), These Wilder Years (1956), Tea and Sympathy (1956), Tension at Table Rock (1956), The Unguarded Moment (1956), Hot Summer Night (1957), The Tattered Dress (1957), The Fiend Who Walked the West (1958) and Night of the Quarter Moon (1959). = Films = While Andrews' film acting career began in earnest in his forties, he appeared much older than he actually was and he was consistently typecast as a grandfatherly type, and thus he is most strongly associated with these roles in later films. Though he often played amiable characters, Andrews was equally adept at portraying sleazy businessman types or uptight bureaucrats and officials. Andrews appeared in several popular films including Elmer Gantry (1960) in which he was memorable as George F. Babbitt, The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963) in both of which he played the Defense Secretary, Send Me No Flowers (1964) with Doris Day and Rock Hudson, and Avanti! (1972) in which he was a very convincing agent of the State Department. Among his other film credits are The Young Savages (1961), The Young Doctors (1961), Advise & Consent (1962), The Thrill of It All (1963), Good Neighbor Sam (1964), Youngblood Hawke (1964), Kisses for My President (1964), The Glass Bottom Boat (1966); The Trouble with Girls (1969) with Elvis Presley, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) as Admiral Harold R. Stark, How to Frame a Figg (1971), The Million Dollar Duck (1971), Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1972), Charley and the Angel (1973), and The Seniors (1978). He played the character of \\"Grandpa\\" Howard Baker in John Hughes' film Sixteen Candles (1984). His final appearance in a feature film was in Gremlins (1984). = Television = Andrews guested on many television series including: Mama, Thriller, Goodyear Television Playhouse, Hands of Mystery, The United States Steel Hour, Justice, Cheyenne, The Twilight Zone (in the episodes \\"Third From the Sun\\", and \\"You Drive\\"), The Eleventh Hour, Route 66, Naked City, Gunsmoke, Rawhide, Bonanza, Alias Smith and Jones, The Wild Wild West, Ironside, The F.B.I., The Beverly Hillbillies, Mr. Novak, Sanford and Son, One Day at a Time, Love American Style, Ellery Queen, The Invaders, Bewitched, Hawaii Five-O, Charlie's Angels, The Rookies, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Storefront Lawyers, Sergeant Bilko, The Love Boat, The Andy Griffith Show, Fantasy Island, Three's Company, The Bob Newhart Show and Quincy, M.E.. Andrews was a regular on the ABC series, Broadside (1964‚Äì1965) as Commander Roger Adrian. He had previously filmed the pilot for the popular series Hazel in the role of George Baxter. His was the only role re-cast when the show went to series; he was replaced by actor Don DeFore. The other cast members (star Shirley Booth, Whitney Blake, and Bobby Buntrock) stayed with the show. He also had the lead role as Harry Flood in the short lived NBC series Supertrain (1979), at the time, the most expensive series ever aired in the United States. Nine episodes were made, including a 2-hour pilot episode, airing between February 7 to May 5, 1979. The premise was a nuclear-powered bullet train that was equipped with amenities more appropriate to a cruise ship. Much like its contemporary The Love Boat, the plots concerned the passengers' social lives, usually with multiple intertwining storylines. Most of the cast of a given episode were guest stars. The production was elaborate, with huge sets and a high-tech model train for outside shots. It received poor reviews and low ratings. Despite attempts to salvage the show by reworking the cast, it went off air after only three months. NBC, which had produced the show itself, with help from Dark Shadows producer Dan Curtis, was unable to recoup its losses. Combined with the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics the following season, which cost NBC millions in ad revenue, the series nearly bankrupted the network. For these reasons, Supertrain has been called one of the greatest television flops. Andrews played the character of Charley in the 1966 dramatization of Death of a Salesman, and constantly acted throughout the 1970s as Elton Dykstra on The Intruders, Ernest W. Stanley on The Man Who Came to Dinner, Mayor Chrisholm alongside Don Knotts in the film How to Frame a Figg (1971), and Mayor Massey on The Whiz Kid and the Mystery at Riverton. In 1968, he played a safecracker in a 4-part episode of I Dream of Jeannie and later, in early 1969, he was a drug-dealing mortician on Mod Squad. In 1982, he guest starred as Jack Tripper's (John Ritter) grandfather in an episode of ABC's Three's Company.  Personal life  Andrews' Broadway career was interrupted by military service during World War II.He served as Captain and commanding officer of \\"Battery C\\" within the 751st Field Artillery Battalion of the US Army and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal in September of 1945. Andrews married Emily Barnes in 1955. They had two daughters, Abigail and Tabitha, and a son, Edward III. Andrews was an avid yachtsman.  Death  On March 8, 1985, Andrews suffered a heart attack at his home in Pacific Palisades. He was transported to Santa Monica Hospital where he died later that day. A memorial service for Andrews was held at the St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Pacific Palisades on March 11. Andrews was later cremated.

She was queen mother during the reign of King Gustav III. Background Louisa Ulrika was born in Berlin as the daughter of Frederick William I of Prussia and his wife Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, and was thus a younger sister of both Wilhelmine of Bayreuth and Frederick the Great. She was given the Swedish name Ulrika because Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden had been her god mother. She exchanged letters with her godmother, and it was thought that she would marry a future son by Ulrika Eleonora, as Ulrika Eleonora herself had once been considered as a consort for Louisa Ulrika's father. However, Ulrika Eleonora remained childless. Louisa Ulrika was described as beautiful, intelligent, with a fierce temperament and a strong will. She was given an advanced education in accordance with the French age of enlightenment by the governess Marthe de Roucoulle and the governor Maturin Veyssi√©re la Croze, both French Huguenots. Her intellectual interests were not opposed by her father who, while disapproving in her brothers interest for learning, did not do so in the case of Louisa Ulrika, who was reportedly a favorite of her father. She and her eldest brother, the future Frederick the Great, had a reasonably good relationship, sharing their interest in science and culture. Her favorites among her siblings were her younger brother Prince Augustus William of Prussia and her sister Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia. At the court of her mother, she was introduced to Voltaire, with whom she engaged in a lifelong correspondence, and Maupertuis. Several dynastic marriages were considered for her from 1732 onward, including Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales, Charles III of Spain and Louis of Hesse-Darmstadt, but none came to fruition. She was appointed co-adjutrix of Quedlinburg Abbey with the prospect of becoming a reigning princess-abbess in 1743, a future of which she did not approve. In 1743, an election was held to appoint a crown prince to the Swedish throne, as Frederick I of Sweden was childless, and the French de facto regent, Cardinal Fleury, suggested a marriage between Louisa Ulrika and the French candidate: Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken. This plans discontinued when Christian lost the election to the Russian candidate, Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp. When negotiations were made to arrange a marriage for the newly elected crown prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden, the first candidate for the match was Princess Louise of Denmark. These plans were revoked when a decision was made to create a triple alliance between Sweden, Russia and Prussia through dynastic marriage. The heir to the Swedish throne was therefore to marry a member of the Prussian royal house, while the heir to the Russian throne was to marry Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (the future Catherine the Great) who had been selected by Prussia. In accordance with this agreement, Louisa Ulrika or her sister Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia were to be selected for the Swedish match. The Swedish envoy in Berlin, Carl Rudensch√∂ld, inspected them and recommended that the proposal be made to Louisa Ulrika. Frederick the Great himself preferred Anna Amalia for the Swedish marriage: he described Anna Amalia for the Swedish representatives as goodhearted and more suitable for Sweden, while Louisa Ulrika was arrogant, temperamental and a plotting intriguer. It has been suggested that Fredrick's judgment was given because he believed that Anna Amalia would be easier to control as a Prussian agent in Sweden than the strong willed and dominant Louisa Ulrika. After having consulted Adolf Frederick, however, the Swedes chose Louisa Ulrika, and her brother gave his consent on 1 March 1744. She was given tuition about Sweden, was advised not to get involved in politics, and converted to Lutheranism 28 June.

On 17 July 1744, Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Frederick were married per procura in Berlin, with her favorite brother August Wilhelm as proxy for the absent groom. She was escorted from Berlin to Swedish Pomerania by the Swedish envoy count Carl Gustaf Tessin, his spouse Ulla Tessin and his wife's niece Charlotta Sparre, who was appointed her maid of honor. In Swedish Pomerania, the entourage was welcomed by the Swedish General Governor of the province and the court of the late queen under the leadership of her Mistress of the Robes, countess Hedvig Elisabet Str√∂mfelt: she kept only her lady-in-waiting Wilhelmine von der Knesebeck and a couple of footmen of her Prussian entourage. The entourage left from R√ºgen and arrived in Sweden in Karlskrona, where she was officially welcomed by her spouse, Crown Prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden. On 18 August 1744, they were welcomed by King Frederick I at Drottningholm Palace, where their second wedding ceremony was performed the same day, followed by a ball, a court reception and the consummation of the marriage. Louisa Ulrika and Adolf Frederick reportedly had a mutually good impression of each other at their first meeting, and their personal relationship is described as mutually happy and harmonious. Adolf Frederick is described as introverted, gentle, and submissive. Reportedly, Louisa Ulrika was pleased with him because she immediately felt secure in the fact that she was his superior. Already during their first day together, she informed him that her brother Frederick the Great had plans for the alliance between Sweden, Russia and Prussia, and asked him to raise the subject with the Prussian envoy, which he also agreed to. Louisa Ulrika was received with enthusiasm in Sweden as the hope for the salvation of succession crisis. At the birth of her first child in 1745, no children had been born in the Swedish royal house in over 50 years and she gained initial popularity with her beauty, wit and interest in science and culture. Carl Gustaf Tessin described her as \\"the wisdom of a god in the image of an angel\\",. Despite French being her native language, she was tutored in Swedish by Carl Jesper Benzelius and mastered it well after only two years. She studied Swedish literature and gathered a Swedish language library, she corresponded with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and created a nature scientific collection. Her arrogant and haughty demeanor, however, eventually made her less popular outside of the royal court. Upon her arrival, she was granted Drottningholm Palace as her summer residence, where the \\"Young Court\\", as it was called, amused themselves with picnics, masquerades and French language amateur theater. The Crown Prince's court was dominated by Carl Gustaf Tessin, who escorted Louisa Ulrika to Sweden and remained an influential favorite during her years as Crown Princess. Adolf Frederick never cared much for Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika had him appointed marshal at court and eventually royal governor of her son Prince Gustav. Tessin was behind many amusements in the circle of the Crown Princess, and it was said that he was only too eager to please Louisa Ulrika in any way possible. There were unconfirmed rumors that Tessin was the lover of Louisa Ulrika during her tenure as Crown Princess. Her son Gustav III later addressed these rumors, that although Count Tessin had been in love with her, his feelings were one-sided and not answered by his mother, as a love affair with a noble contradicted the \\"natural contempt\\" which Louisa Ulrika herself as a royal felt for every subject, noble or not. Her circle at court included Henrika Juliana von Liewen, who immediately became her favorite among her ladies-in-waiting; the intellectual Cath√©rine Charlotte De la Gardie, the scientist Eva Ekeblad, and the witty Anders Johan von H√∂pken. From the moment she arrived in Sweden, Louisa Ulrika engaged in political activity. Her political ideal was absolute monarchy, and she disliked the Swedish constitutional monarchy from the moment it was explained to her. She also disliked the system of legal justice. When she, at one point, thought herself exposed to a plot, she wrote: \\"The laws are so strange, and one does not dare to arrest someone on mere suspicion without proof, which benefit the individual more than the Kingdom.\\" She respected the political ability of Carl Gustaf Tessin, and identified him as an ally in her wish to increase royal power. At Christmas 1744, she visited Tessin and gave him a lantern in the guise of the goddess Diana with the inscription: \\"Made only to shed light on the political system of the day\\". In the circle of her own court, she was surrounded by sympathizers of the Hats. Her favorite Henrika Juliana von Liewen was a prominent sympathizer of the Hats, as was Claes Ekeblad, Hans Henrik von Liewen, Anders Johan von H√∂pken and other members of her personal circle of friends, and through her court connections, she made an alliance with the Hats (party). Her strategy was to affect the votes in the parliament of the Riksdag through bribes. After the birth of her eldest son in 1746, she accompanied the Crown Prince on an official tour through the country, during which she gathered agents among members of the Caps through bribes. At the visit of the Cap's parliamentary Kalsenius, she described him as: \\"The biggest villain in the world, but I will not leave until I have bribed him. That is the only means by which one can reach the goal one has in mind.\\" Kalsenius is also confirmed to have voted with the Hats party in the exactly the issues interesting to Louisa Ulrika during the votes in the Riksdag. Her goal was to overthrow the constitution and reintroduce the system of absolute monarchy with enlightened absolutism in Sweden. Her plans were internationally noted already by her creation of the L'Ordre de l'Harmonie, with the motto of unity. Her plans were opposed by Russia and Great Britain, who in 1746, allied with the Caps (party), attempted to stage a coup through their agents in Sweden against the royal house. In February 1748, Louisa Ulrika prepared her first coup d'√©tat to deposed parliamentary rule in favor of absolute monarchy. At that point, the king had taken ill and Russia was engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession. With the support of Tessin and Frederick the Great, Louisa Ulrika and the Hats party agreed to change the constitution in favor of more royal power, should the king die when the Russians were engaged in the war and unable to react. Louisa Ulrika agreed to let the Riksdag keep their power over the laws, while the monarch should be given power of the army, treasury and the foreign policy. The coup was aborted with the peace of the war and the recovery of Frederick I. In foreign policy, she was loyal to Prussia. Her brother Frederick the Great had given her the task to break the alliance between Sweden and Russia in favor of an alliance with Prussia: she made an alliance with Tessin, the Prussian ambassador and the Hats party, convinced Adolf Frederick to state his support for a Prussian alliance, and though she failed in the 1745 vote, the parliament voted for an alliance between Sweden, Prussia and France in 1747.

In 1751, the night before the death of King Frederick I, Louisa Ulrika prepared a coup d'√©tat with Crown Prince Adolf Frederick and Hans Henrik von Liewen. The plan was, that rather than being confirmed as monarch by the Riksdag of the Estates after having made the royal oath to respect the constitution, Adolf Frederick was to take the initiative and, immediately after the King's death, take control of the royal council and declare himself monarch by inheritance rather than to be elected as such by the Riksdag. To investigate the preparations of the royal council, Louisa Ulrika personally contacted her favorite, Councillor Carl Gustaf Tessin, in his bed chamber that night. However, Tessin refused to inform her of the plans of the council, and further refused to support her plans of a coup. Upon the moment of the King's death on 25 March, Tessin instead presented Adolf Frederick with a statement of a royal oath to sign before being acknowledged as king. On 26 March 1751, Adolf Frederick made an oath to the Riksdag of the Estates to respect the constitution before being acknowledged as king, in the presence of Louisa Ulrika. Prior to their coronation, Louisa Ulrika, in collaboration with her brother Frederick the Great, tried to prove that the constitution allowed the monarch more power than what the Riksdag had stated, and made clear that she was considering to refuse to allow Adolf Frederick sign the oath. On the day before the coronation, she was eventually forced to allow Adolf Frederick to sign it. Adolf Frederick and Louisa Ulrika were crowned King and Queen of Sweden at Storkyrkan in Stockholm 26 November 1751. As Queen, Louisa Ulrika had some significance as a patron of culture and science. In 1753, she founded the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, and acted as patron of Carl von Linn√©, who was given the responsibility for the nature scientific collection at Drottningholm Palace. Her \\"adoption\\" of Gustav Badin was, in fact, intended as a form of scientific experiment. She also acted as patron for artists such as Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, Olof von Dalin, Jean Erik Rehn and Johan Pasch. She also had the Drottningholm Palace Theater and the Confidencen theater built: however, being a Francophile, as was the fashion, she did not benefit but rather interrupted the development of the Swedish theater, as she evicted the newly founded Swedish language theater at Bollhuset and replaced it with a French Theatre, the Du Londel Troupe, which was only a benefit for those who could speak French. Immediately after the coronation, Louisa Ulrika prepared a new coup in favor of absolute monarchy. Queen Louisa Ulrika strongly dominated her husband and the court, and she would likely had been the real ruler during her spouse's reign had Sweden been an absolute monarchy: at this point, however, the King was a mere decoration. This greatly displeased the Queen, herself born in an absolute monarchy. She could not understand nor condone the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag. For her, it was not acceptable for a royal person to have to receive peasants in the royal salons, as she was forced to do with the peasant's representatives from the Riksdag. She was further enraged when the Riksdag forced the King to give up his claims on the throne of Holstein-Gottorp. To display her contempt, she humiliated the representatives of the Riksdag by using the etiquette of the royal court: she stopped their carriages at the Palace gates, forced them to wait for hours while she let those who arrived after them be received, and let them sit on smaller chairs to humiliate them. In the court theatres, the French theatre troupe and the Italian opera company performed plays encouraging hinting that the King to take control of his kingdom. Tessin was no longer in her favor as a political ally, as he wrote in his diary that she no longer discussed politics with him and \\"claimed that she took no part in politics\\". She also broke her earlier alliance with the Hats, which opposed her plans of an absolute monarchy. Instead, she formed a new party among the opposition in the Riksdag by promising rewards to her followers in case of a successful coup in favor of royal power. This group was called Hovpartiet (English: 'The Royal Court Party'), the leading members being Carl Gustaf L√∂wenhielm, Adam Horn, Nils Adam Bielke, Erik Brahe, Eric Wrangel and Gustaf Jacob Horn. In 1753, she planned to stage a coup against the royal council to overthrow the constitution in collaboration with Anders Johan von H√∂pken, Carl Fredrik Scheffer and Claes Ekeblad, but the plan was aborted when Ekeblad refused. She unsuccessfully tried to convince France to retract their support of the Hats to deprive them of French support in the future conflict she and the Hovpartiet expected with the Hats in the constitution issue by claiming that she did not wish to change the constitution, merely attempting to prove that it did in fact allow for greater royal power than the Riksdag was willing to admit. The year 1754 was the year of the alienation of Tessin. His favor with the Queen had deteriorated since 1750-51: first, when he used the Riksdag to force her to agree to the engagement between Crown Prince Gustav and Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, when she herself had wished to engage her son to Margravine Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt; and second, when he had betrayed her plans of a coup at the accession of her spouse. The relation between Louisa Ulrika and Tessin was never well seen by Adolf Frederick. Contemporary witnesses state the Tessin was in love with her and \\"was not always able to conceal his feelings for the Crown Princess\\". It is unknown whether there was ever any physical relationship between the Queen and Tessin, but Louisa Ulrika herself mention in her memoirs that she had been offended somehow in that aspect. According to Crown Prince Gustav wrote in 1769, that Tessin had made Louisa Ulrika \\"suggestions far from the reverence one is expected to show toward a sovereign.\\" The Queen felt her pride offended and informed the King, who surprised Tessin on his knees before the Queen. This incident led to the King's animosity toward Tessin and the exile of Count and Countess Tessin from court. The queen only remarked that she missed Countess Tessin. The question on the replacement of Tessin as the governor of the Crown Prince placed the Queen in conflict with the Riksdag. Tessin was replaced as governor of the Crown Prince with Carl Fredrik Scheffer, a candidate selected by the Riksdag, an appointment which was enforced even after the candidate had been refused by the Queen. In 1755, the Riksdag presented their decision to rectify the loop holes in the constitution which Louisa Ulrika had used to claim that the King had greater constitutional power than the Riksdag had allowed him to practice. They stated that the loop holes in the constitution allowing for royal power would be removed, and that the monarch would no longer be allowed to refuse his signature: if he did so, a stamp with his name would be used. At the same time, a commission of the state begun to investigate political crimes. This resulted in a persecution of the followers of Louisa Ulrika within the Hovpartiet, one of whom, Eric Wrangel, fled to Norway to avoid arrest. Reportedly, this provocation triggered the Queen's plan of a coup d'√©tat, known in history as Coup of 1756. The first plan was for the royal couple to travel to Uppsala under the pretext of a visit to Drottningholm Palace. In Uppsala, they would summon the regiments of N√§rke, V√§rmland and potentially Uppland as well as the Life Guards and march toward the capital. This plan was aborted because of the King's illness in April 1755. To finance the coup, the Queen pawned parts of the Crown Jewels in Berlin. In the three months following her coronation, Louisa Ulrika removed 44 diamonds from the Queen's Crown and replaced them with glass, which she pawned in Berlin as security for a loan by the help of her brother August. At this point, rumors reached the Riksdag. A lady-in-waiting of the Queen, Ulrika Str√∂mfelt, who was a loyal follower of the Hats and not a supporter of absolute monarchy, reportedly informed the Riksdag that parts of the Crown Jewels were missing. In April 1756, the Riksdag demanded to inventory the Crown Jewels. The queen replied that she refused to allow them to see the Crown Jewels as she regarded them as her private property. At this point, the King was taken ill, and she was thereby given the time to send for the jewels from Berlin. She was finally forced to agree to present them to inventory on 22 June. To prevent this, she and her followers within the Hovpartiet, H√•rd, Horn and Brahe, planned to stage the coup before that day, despite the protests of king Adolf Frederick. The plan was to bribe members of the public to create riots in the capital. The supporters of Hovpartiet would then take control of the Stockholm guard and garrison, which were also to be prepared through bribes. When the military was called out to deal with the riots, it would seize control over the capital's military headquarters: the Riksdag would be closed and the opposition arrested and a new Riksdag would be summoned, which would be made to approve of a new constitution, reintroducing absolute monarchy. The 21 June 1756, the royalist Ernst Angel was overheard talking about the plans of a royal revolution while drunk at a tavern. In parallel, one of the royalist officers, Christiernin, attempted to enlist Corporal Schedvin of the garrison in the coup who, however, informed the Hats. On 22 June 1756, the King and Queen left the capital for Ulriksdal Palace to avoid being present during the inventory of the Crown Jewels. That same day, Ernst Angel, Christiernin, St√•lsv√§rd, Puke, Angel and a number of others were arrested. During the interrogation, Ernst Angel revealed the whole plot. When the King and Queen returned to the capital that night, the streets were patrolled by militia. The members of Hovpartiet were arrested or fled to avoid arrest. In July 1756, seven members of the Queen's followers were executed. The Riksdag of the Estates was well aware that Queen Louisa Ulrika was responsible for the attempted coup d'√©tat, and there were discussions as how to deal with the Queen's guilt. In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possibly with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Archbishop of Uppsala Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that \\"she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she was responsible for the blood of the recently executed\\". She officially replied to the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured \\"that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom\\": Troilius reported that \\"only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best\\". The Archbishop reported, that he observed \\"tears of rage and sorrow\\" in her eyes. In private, Louisa Ulrika regarded the reprimand as a humiliating insult, and wrote to her brother Frederick the Great, that during the interview she attempted to display \\"all the coldness, all the contempt possible to make in a demonstration [...] In my hardest moments I remind myself that I am the sister of Frederick the Great\\", and that she regretted nothing but that her revolution had failed. At the same time the King also had a statement read for him by a delegation from the Riksdag, stating that he would be deposed if such an incident was ever to occur again. In 1757, Sweden entered the Seven Years' War and declared war on Prussia, the birth country of Louisa Ulrika. The Queen opposed the act and regarded is as an insult, especially since she assumed that a Swedish victory over Prussia would result in the deposition of Adolf Frederick in favor of Christian of Zweibrucken- Birkenfeld. However, a potential Swedish defeat was seen by her as a good opportunity for a coup d'√©tat in favor of absolute monarchy, as a defeat would discredit the Riksdag. Therefore, she successfully asked her brother Frederick the Great to ask for her as a mediator in future peace negotiations. When the moment arose in 1760, she could not use it as she lacked necessary funds for bribes. In 1761, however, she managed to secure funds from Great Britain and Prussia, and made an alliance through bribes with the Caps (party) to affect the Riksdag in favor of peace with Prussia. In January 1762, her suggestion of peace with Prussia was accepted in the Riksdag through her bought parliamentarians there, in exchange for a promise not to take revenge on the Hats (party). She was given the official assignment from the Riksdag to handle the peace negotiations with Prussia and secure that Sweden could keep Swedish Pomerania, a task she performed successfully, and she was officially thanked by the Riksdag for her service to the state in May. As a sign of gratitude for this act, the government paid her debts, which made it possible for her to use her money to affect the voting in the Riksdag through bribes. In exchange for her service during the war, she demanded the 1756 reform of the constitution be retracted. It was decided that a special Riksdag of the states should be summoned to discuss a revised constitution: it was eventually set to take place in 1764. During the two years prior, Louisa Ulrika negotiated with members of both the Caps and the Hats to prepare for a successful reform in favor of absolute monarchy. She took the part of a mediator between to the two parties to unite them on which constitution to agree upon before the Riksdag was summoned. To prepare foreign powers for a new political system in Sweden, she founded a secret cabinet, Secret de la Reine, to handle her private foreign policy, appointing first Carl Wilhelm von D√ºben and then Nils Filip Gyldenstolpe in the position of her \\"foreign minister\\". She appointed Anders Rudolf Du Rietz as her informal ambassador to Catherine the Great in Russia, and she also had Carl Julius von Bohlen appointed official ambassador of Sweden in Prussia. She secured the support of Russia, France and Great Britain, but failed in securing the necessary funds for bribes to the coming Riksdag. In November 1764, the unity between the Caps and Hats parties was broken due to the suspicions of France (who supported the Hats) and Great Britain (who supported the Caps), which deprived Louisa Ulrika of her alliance with the Hats party. During the Riksdag of 1765, the Queen attempted to balance the Caps and the Hats by creating a third party of her followers from both parties under her follower Malmstein, which she managed to have elected vice speaker. The election to the Riksdag of 1765 was won by the Caps party. By demonstrating how she could affect the votes in the parliament through her third party, she was able to secure her alliance with the Caps. She also summoned the Ambassador of Russia to Kina Slott to secure support from Russia and its ally Denmark. When the question of the Constitution was finally raised in the Riksdag in August, however, the Caps refused to accept an increased royal power and instead limited the power of the Crown even more. With this, her efforts failed once again. The powerful position of Queen Louisa Ulrika deteriorated with the declining health of her spouse, King Adolf Frederick, and the growing maturity of her son, Crown Prince Gustav. She recognized this threat, and when her son was declared an adult in 1762, she unsuccessfully opposed him taking a seat in the royal council. The tense relationship between her and her son, whom she viewed as a political rival, grew when he opposed her will by insisting to honor his engagement to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, whom he finally married in 1766, instead of marrying a Prussian bride selected by her, which he viewed as a way for her to keep her influence over him and the family. This was illustrated by the Queen's harassment of the Crown Princess when she arrived in Sweden. After the Riksdag of 1766, it was no longer her, but her son the Crown Prince, who became the leader of the followers of absolute monarchy. In 1767, when the French ambassador sketched a suggestion of a Swedish coup d'√©tat, it was, for the first time, the Crown Prince rather than the Queen who was regarded as the natural center figure of the coup. During the December Crisis of 1768, the King refused to sign a state document, and a Riksdag was summoned to handle the situation.The royalists discussed a coup d'√©tat to deposed the Riksdag and reintroduce absolute monarchy. Louisa Ulrika did not support a coup at that point, but her view was disregarded and the Crown Prince was instead seen as the leader of the opposition: the coup d'√©tat was aborted because the Hats party broke an agreement rather than because of the Queen's opposition to it. Her arrogance, her political views and her conflicts with the Riksdag made her less and less liked during her tenure as Queen. Carl Gustaf Tessin once said about her: \\"It seems undeniable, that our Queen would have been the most staunch of republicans, had she been born a subject; but God has let her be born in a position, were one is wary of one's power\\". Queen Dowager Lovisa Ulrika, by Alexander Roslin, 1775. Marital coat of arms of Louisa Ulrika as Queen of Sweden, showing the arms of Sweden and Prussia respectively. In 1771, the King died and she became Queen Dowager. By this time Louisa Ulrika was immensely unpopular in Sweden. When the news of the old King's death reached her son, the new King Gustav III of Sweden, who was then in Paris, he wrote that the Queen Mother be protected, as \\"I know how little loved my mother is\\". In the Revolution of 1772, her son succeeded where she had failed in 1756 by overthrowing the democracy and reinstating absolute monarchy, His revolution was a great satisfaction to her. Louisa Ulrika wrote to Gustav III to gratulate him to the coup upon which she said: \\"Yes, you are my son, and you deserve to be\\". At the time of the coup, she was in Berlin with her daughter. She was present in Swedish Pomerania when the Province gave their allegiance to the new constitution. When her brother, the King of Prussia, told her that the neighboring countries would now attack Sweden, she wrote to him that she would defend the province of Pomerania against him with her own blood. Louisa Ulrika could, however, never settle with the position of Queen Dowager. She had expected to be the real ruler behind the throne, and when her son made it clear that he would rule independently from her, their relationship worsened. In 1772, he prevented her plans to marry off her second son Charles to Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt, and in 1774, Charles was married to Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp instead. Gustav III paid her debts with the condition that she established her own separate court at Fredrikshof Palace. In 1777, she was forced to sell Drottningholm Palace to her son Gustav. In 1777‚Äì78, the conflict with her son erupted and she was a central figure in the great succession scandal regarding the legitimacy of the Crown Prince. In 1777, her two younger sons, Charles and Frederick Adolf, visited her. They claimed all women at court had lovers, and that with the exception of their mother, they could not think of even one who did not. Louisa Ulrika suggested that surely the Queen must also be an exception. In reply, her sons laughed and asked her if she had not heard of the rumors that Sophia Magdalena had an affair with Fredrik Munck. She became very upset and ordered Prince Charles to investigate if this were true, as his inheritance to the throne would be endangered by \\"the common offspred of a common nobleman\\". Charles talked to Munck, Munck talked to King Gustav, Gustav talked to Charles who claimed the whole thing was the fault of the Queen Mother, which resulted in a great conflict between mother and son. When the son of the King was born in 1778, rumours circulated that he was the son of Munck. Louisa Ulrika accused the King of having another man father his child. A great scandal erupted, during which the King even threatened to exile her to Pomerania. In the following conflict, her youngest children, Sofia Albertina and Frederick, who had always been her favourites, took her side against the King. Louisa Ulrika was forced to make a formal statement, during which she withdrew her accusation. The statement was signed by the entire adult royal family except the royal couple; two princes, the princess, the Duchess, and six members of parliament. The relationship with Gustav was not repaired until she was on her deathbed. She died in Svartsj√∂.

Labor historians may concern themselves with issues of gender, race, ethnicity and other factors besides class but chiefly focus on urban or industrial societies which distinguishes it from rural history. The central concerns of labor historians include industrial relations and forms of labor protest (strikes, lock-outs), the rise of mass politics (especially the rise of socialism) and the social and cultural history of the industrial working classes. Labor history developed in tandem with the growth of a self-conscious working-class political movement in many Western countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Whilst early labor historians were drawn to protest movements such as Luddism and Chartism, the focus of labor history was often on institutions: chiefly the labor unions and political parties. Exponents of this institutional approach included Sidney and Beatrice Webb. The work of the Webbs, and other pioneers of the discipline, was marked by optimism about the capacity of the labor movement to effect fundamental social change and a tendency to see its development as a process of steady, inevitable and unstoppable progress. As two contemporary labor historians have noted, early work in the field was \\"designed to service and celebrate the Labour movement.\\"Mike Savage and Andrew Miles, The Remaking of the British Working Class, 1840-1940, Routledge, 1994, p. 1. Marxist influence In the 1950s to 1970s, labor history was redefined and expanded in focus by a number of historians, amongst whom the most prominent and influential figures were E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. The motivation came from current left-wing politics in Britain and the United States and reached red-hot intensity. Kenneth O. Morgan, a more traditional liberal historian, explains the dynamic: :the ferocity of argument owed more to current politics, the unions‚Äô winter of discontent [in 1979], and rise of a hard-left militant tendency within the world of academic history as well as within the Labour Party. The new history was often strongly Marxist, which fed through the work of brilliant evangelists like Raphael Samuel into the New Left Review, a famous journal like Past and Present, the Society of Labour History and the work of a large number of younger scholars engaged in the field. Non-scholars like Tony Benn joined in. The new influence of Marxism upon Labour studies came to affect the study of history as a whole.Kenneth O. Morgan, My Histories (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 85. Morgan sees benefits: :In many ways, this was highly beneficial: it encouraged the study of the dynamics of social history rather than a narrow formal institutional view of labour and the history of the Labour Party; it sought to place the experience of working people within a wider technical and ideological context; it encouraged a more adventurous range of sources, ‚Äòhistory from below‚Äô so-called, and rescued them from what Thompson memorably called the ‚Äòcondescension of posterity‚Äô; it brought the idea of class centre-stage in the treatment of working-class history, where I had always felt it belonged; it shed new light on the poor and dispossessed for whom the source materials were far more scrappy than those for the bourgeoisie, and made original use of popular evidence like oral history, not much used before.Morgan, My Histories (2015) p 86. Morgan tells of the downside as well: : But the Marxist ‚Äì or sometimes Trotskyist ‚Äì emphasis in Labour studies was too often doctrinaire and intolerant of non-Marxist dissent‚Äìit was also too often plain wrong, distorting the evidence within a narrow doctrinaire framework. I felt it incumbent upon me to help rescue it. But this was not always fun. I recall addressing a history meeting in Cardiff...when, for the only time in my life, I was subjected to an incoherent series of attacks of a highly personal kind, playing the man not the ball, focusing on my accent, my being at Oxford and the supposedly reactionary tendencies of my empiricist colleagues.Morgan, My Histories (2015) p 86. online at JSTOR Thompson and Hobsbawm were Marxists who were critical of the existing labour movement in Britain. They were concerned to approach history \\"from below\\" and to explore the agency and activity of working people at the workplace, in protest movements and in social and cultural activities. Thompson's seminal study The Making of the English Working ClassE.P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class, Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1963. was particularly influential in setting a new agenda for labor historians and locating the importance of the study of labor for social history in general. Also in the 1950s and 1960s, historians began to give serious attention to groups who had previously been largely neglected, such as women and non- caucasian ethnic groups. Some historians situated their studies of gender and race within a class analysis: for example, C. L. R. James, a Marxist who wrote about the struggles of blacks in the Haitian Revolution. Others questioned whether class was a more important social category than gender or race and pointed to racism, patriarchy and other examples of division and oppression within the working class. Labor history remains centered on two fundamental sets of interest: institutional histories of workers' organizations, and the \\"history from below\\" approach of the Marxist historians. Despite the influence of the Marxists, many labor historians rejected the revolutionary implications implicit in the work of Thompson, Hobsbawm et al. In the 1980s, the importance of class itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a postmodernist approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a \\"language of class\\". Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by accommodation, acceptance of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change. United States Labor history in the United States is primarily based in history departments, with occasional representation inside labor unions. The scholarship deals with the institutional history of labor unions and the social history of workers. In recent years there's been special attention to historically marginal groups, especially blacks, women, Hispanics and Asians.Daniel J. Walkowitz and Donna T. Haverty-Stacke, eds.

He reports that labor history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labor, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labor historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.Neville Kirk, \\"Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal?

Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, \\"in sharp decline,\\" because: :there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class. Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds.

After four cassette-only releases on Casetiau Neon, the band had their first vinyl release in 1987 on Anhrefn Records, with the Hwgr- Grawth-Og EP featuring just Edwards and Morgan, which was picked up by John Peel and led to a session being recorded for his BBC Radio 1 show (the first of five such sessions).\\"Datblygu biography\\", BBC.

The Place of Welsh Pop Music, Ashgate, , p. 87 The band's first album, Wyau (Eggs), was released in 1988, and was followed two years later with Pyst (Posts) on the Ofn label. Davies left in 1990 and the group continued as a duo for a while, before being augmented by a series of musicians, notably drummer Al Edwards. Moving to Ankst Records, the Christmas- themed Blwch Tymer Tymor cassette was issued in 1991. Edwards collaborated with T≈∑ Gwydr and Llwybr Llaethog on the 1992 album LL.LL v T.G. MC DRE, before releasing a final Datblygu album in 1993 with Libertino. After a single, \\"Alcohol\\"/\\"Amnesia\\" in 1995, the band split up. In August 2008 a new 7\\" single \\"Can y Mynach Modern\\" (The Song of the Modern Monk) was released. The song recounts (over its brief ninety seconds) the turmoil and madness that engulfed Edwards as the band fell apart in the mid nineties and the long road to recovery that resulted from the fallout. The track is intended as a full stop on their legacy rather than a brand new start. Datblygu have been cited as a major influence on the generation of Welsh bands that followed, including Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Super Furry Animals (who covered Datblygu's \\"Y Teimlad\\" on their Mwng album). In a rare TV appearance, David featured on S4C documentary programme O Flaen dy Lygaid in 2009, presented by Cardiff-based broadcaster and friend of David's, Ali Yassine, which followed David and his battle to recover from mental illness. The programme also featured Datblygu bandmember and former Pobol y Cwm actress Ree Davies and her own battle against mental illness. In 2012 an exhibition celebrating the band's history was held in a Cardiff coffee shop. Edwards and Morgan reunited in 2012 for the EP Darluniau'r Ogof Unfed Ganrif ar Hugain.

The gray line differentiates the glaciated (northern) and unglaciated (southern) sections of the plateau. The unglaciated plateau extends southwestward into eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, where it is called the Cumberland Plateau. The Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau is located in an arc around southeastern Ohio into western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. This area is a dissected plateau, characterized by sandstone, shale, and many coal seams. This is the part of the Allegheny Plateau that lies outside the continental glaciation of the ice age. Geography One of the most spectacular and scenic areas in this region is located in southeast Ohio, and is known as the Hocking Hills region. This area, similar to but smaller than the Red River Gorge in the Cumberland Plateau in Kentucky, features cliffs, rock shelters and waterfalls. The largest city in the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. =Rivers= The Ohio River roughly bisects the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau in generally a north-northeast to south-southwest direction. Other significant rivers in the plateau include the Muskingum River and Tuscarawas River in Ohio, the Youghiogheny River and Allegheny River in Pennsylvania, and the Monongahela River and Kanawha River in West Virginia. The Kanawha River is formed by the confluence of the New River and the Gauley River. All three rivers are known for their spectacular deep gorges.

It is characterized by Pennsylvanian age sandstones, shales and coal. Nearly all of the counties in the area are part of the television market known as the Kentucky‚ÄìIllinois‚ÄìIndiana tri-state area. Physical regions of Kentucky; not all defined as Western Coal Field contains coal Included areas The Western Coal Field region of Kentucky includes all of the following counties: *Butler County *Daviess County *Hancock County *Henderson County *Hopkins County *McLean County *Muhlenberg County *Ohio County *Union County *Webster County Additionally, the region includes parts of the following counties, mostly in the Clifty Area, which does not contain coal: *Breckinridge County *Christian County *Edmonson County *Grayson County *Hart County *Logan County *Todd County *Warren County The term Western Coalfield (or Western Coal Field) is used to define the region with Pennsylvanian-age strata, largely sandstone and shale, in contrast to the Mississippian-age limestone of the adjoining and older Pennyroyal region. A transitional zone, generally defined as being part of the coalfield, is the Clifty Area, where there is no coal but some sandstone is bituminous, and has commercial value as paving material and potentially as tar sands for liquid refining. The biggest concentration of surface mines in this region has historically been in Hopkins, Muhlenberg, and Ohio counties. All three counties still contain a very large amount of coal and have active mining, surface and underground, operations taking place. The use of power shovels and draglines were very common in these counties where the coal would lay as close as 60‚Äì80 feet from the surface. This is a region that was considered to be the largest producer of coal in the world from the 1960s through part of the '80s until it dramatically dropped in the early '90s after the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The largest mining company founded during the 30-year span of prosperity became Peabody Coal Company (Peabody Energy), whose corporate offices were located in the region in Henderson, Ky., at the time. A combination of economic shifts and industry contributed to a decline in coal production starting in the early 1970s. Western Kentucky coal production has risen since 2004, partly because coal-fired power plants have been reconfigured to meet Clean Air Act requirements, making it easier for them to burn and the region's higher-sulfur coal. In 2012 Western Kentucky coal production exceeded Eastern Kentucky production for the first time since 1960, because of the decline of the industry in the Central Appalachian Basin. In 2003 Armstrong Coal Company leased a large chunk of property in the region from Peabody to recover the coal.http://energy.ky.gov/Coal%20Facts%20Library/Kentucky%20Coal%20Facts%20-%2013th%20Edition%20%282013%29.pdf See also *Coal mining in Kentucky References Coal mining regions in the United States Regions of Kentucky Mining in Kentucky ","title":"Western Coal Field"},{"id":"603181","title":"Alice Pearce"},{"id":"603183","text":"Psi is a free instant messaging client for the XMPP protocol (including such services as Google Talk) which uses the Qt toolkit. It runs on Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems), Windows, macOS and OS/2Psi build for OS/2. Version 0.15, ZIP package. (including eComStation and ArcaOS). User interface of program is very flexible in customization. For example, there are \\"multi windows\\" and \\"all in one\\" modes, support of different iconsets and themes. Ready-to-install deb and RPM packages are available for many Linux distributions. Successful ports of Psi were reported for Haiku, FreeBSD and Sun Solaris operating systems. Due to Psi's free/open-source nature, several forks have appeared, which occasionally contain features that may appear in future official Psi versions.  Project name  'Psi' is the twenty-third letter of the Greek alphabet (Œ®), which is used as the software's logo.  Mission statement  The goal of the Psi project is to create a powerful, yet easy-to-use XMPP client that tries to strictly adhere to the XMPP drafts and XMPP XEPs. This means that in most cases, Psi will not implement a feature unless there is an accepted standard for it in the XMPP community. Doing so ensures that Psi will be compatible, stable, and predictable.  History  The application was created by Justin Karneges and it began as a side project. At various points during its existence Karneges was paid to develop the codebase, during which Psi flourished. Typically however, the release cycle of Psi is relatively slow, but the client has always been seen by its fans as a very stable and powerful instant messaging client. Karneges left the project in late 2004 to pursue other endeavors. In 2002 Michail Pishchagin started hacking Qt code which later became libpsi library. Pishchagin joined the team in March 2003 and he is responsible for many large chunks in Psi code. In November 2004, maintenance was taken over by Kevin Smith, a long-time contributor to the project. In 2009, Smith handed maintenance back to Karneges, who also maintains Iris, the Qt/C++ XMPP library upon which Psi is based. Remko Tron√ßon started writing his custom patches for Psi in 2003, and became an official developer in May 2005. In 2009 a Psi fork named Psi+ was started. Project purposes are: implementation of new features, writing of patches and plugins for transferring them to upstream. As of 2017 all active Psi+ developers have become official Psi developers, and now Psi+ is just a development branch of Psi with rolling release development model. Users who wants to receive new features and bug fixes very quickly may use Psi+ on daily basis. Users who do not care about new trends and prefer constancy may choose Psi as it uses classical development model and its releases are quite rare.  Features  Because XMPP allows gateways to other services, which many servers support, it can also connect to Yahoo!, AIM, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ and Microsoft networks. Other services available using gateway servers include RSS and Atom news feeds, sending SMS messages to cellular networks and weather reports. As of 2012, Psi has language packs for 20 languages, with more being created. Emoticon packs are supported using the jisp format. Many jisp emoticon packs are available, including ones from AIM, iChat, and Trillian. Psi supports file transfers between other XMPP clients, and it is possible to send to or receive files from other IM networks, if the user's servers support this. Psi supports Contact Is Typing Notification (which works with Yahoo!, MSN, and AIM contacts). Version 0.10, released in January 2006, brought automatically resizing contact list and composing window in chat dialogs, tabbed chats, support for Growl messaging system on Mac OS X, window transparency and many other changes. Support of audio and video calls in Psi via Jingle is implemented via officially supported plugin PsiMediaPsiMedia. = Encryption = Security is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for both client-to-server (TLS) and client-to-client (OpenPGPOpenPGP Plugin, OTROTR Plugin, and OMEMOOMEMO Plugin) via appropriate plugins. Encryption of messages in group chats is supported only via OMEMO plugin.

He studied law with McLeod, Morson and McQuarrie in Charlottetown and with Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen in London. He was admitted to the bar in 1898. Arsenault married Bertha, the daughter of Francis Gallant. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1908 as a Conservative. In 1912 he became Attorney-General in the government of Premier John A. Mathieson. When Mathieson left politics for a judicial appointment in 1917, Arsenault succeeded him becoming the first Acadian to be premier in any province. Arsenault's government repealed legislation to restrict automobile travel on the island to specific days and routes. His government also founded the PEI Travel Bureau.

In its original usage, it referred to anyone who is not autistic or a 'cousin' with an 'autistic-like' brain; the term was later narrowed to refer to those with strictly typical neurology, that is, without a defined neurological difference. In other words, this refers to anyone who does not have any developmental disorders such as autism, developmental coordination disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The term was later adopted by both the neurodiversity movement and the scientific community. In recent times, people with any sort of mental disorder, whether congenital or acquired, have also sometimes been excluded from the neurotypical label. In this sense, the term is now contrasted to neurodivergent, ND, or neuroatypical, an umbrella term inclusive of people with diverse mental and behavioral disorders, such as mood, anxiety, dissociative, psychotic, personality, and eating disorders. The conditions themselves, following the neurodiversity and social construction of disability models and in distance from the hegemonic medical model of disability (otherwise known in the neurodiversity community as the \\"pathology paradigm\\"), are often referred to as neurodivergences‚Äîthat is, neurotypes that are divergent from a given social and medical norm. Neurotypical, as a specific term for its original purpose within autistic communities, has been replaced by some with allistic, or \\"nypical\\", which has roughly the same meaning that \\"neurotypical\\" had originally. These terms refer to those who are not autistic and who do not possess another pervasive developmental disorder, even if they may be neurologically atypical in some other way, such as having dyslexia. The National Autistic Society of the United Kingdom says of the term \\"neurotypical\\": \\"This term is only used within the autism community so may not be applicable in, for example, the popular press.\\"  Criticism  In a review of 2020 two basic observations were noted: * Many people who do not have an autism diagnosis have autistic traits. This was known by researchers as the ‚Äúbroad autism phenotype‚Äù. So, there was no clear bimodal distribution separating people with and without autism. In reality there were not two distinct populations, one ‚Äúneurotypical‚Äù and one ‚Äúneurodivergent‚Äù.Russell G. (2020): Critiques of the Neurodiversity Movement.

As a functionary of the Communist International, Sneevliet guided the formation of the Communist Party of China in 1921. In his native country, he was the founder, chairman and only Representative for the Revolutionary Socialist (Workers') Party, RSP/RSAP. He took part in the Communist resistance against the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, for which he was executed by the Germans in April 1942. Biography =Early life= Hendricus \\"Henk\\" Sneevliet was born on 13 May 1883 in Rotterdam, Netherlands and grew up in Den Bosch. He was the son of Anthonie Sneevliet, a cigar maker, and the former Henrica J.W. van Macklenbergh.John E. Lunn, \\"Hendricus Josephus Franciscus Marie 'Henk\\" Sneevliet,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: Volume 2, M-Z. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 909-910. After finishing his education in 1900, Sneevliet moved to Zutphen and working for the Dutch railways. He became a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party (SDAP) as well as the Netherlands Association of Railway and Tramway Employees (NV) in 1902. From 1906, Sneevliet was active for the SDAP in Zwolle, where he became the first social democrat city council member in the elections of 1907. Sneevliet was very active in the NV and was elected to the union's executive committee in 1906. In 1909 he was tapped as vice-chairman of the union and named as editor-in-chief of the union's official journal. He became chairman of the union in 1911. Sneevliet, as a committed socialist and militant trade unionist, was strongly supportive of an international seamen's strike which was called in 1911 and was disgruntled by the failure of his union and political party to support the campaign. As a result, he resigned from both organizations, joining instead the more radical Social Democratic Party of the Netherlands (forerunner of the Dutch Communist Party) and writing for the Marxist magazine De Nieuwe Tijd (The New Time). Sneevliet's alienation strengthened him in his decision to leave the Netherlands for the Dutch East Indies. =Dutch East Indies= Sneevliet lived in the Dutch East Indies (roughly equal to present day Indonesia) from 1913 until 1918, where he quickly became active in the struggle against Dutch colonial rule. In 1914, he was a co-founder of the Indies Social Democratic Association (ISDV), in which both Dutch and Indonesian people were active. He also returned to union work, becoming a member of the Vereeniging van Spoor- en Tramwegpersoneel, a railway union which was unique in having both Dutch and Indonesian members. Thanks to his experience as a union leader, he soon managed to turn this still fairly moderate union into a more modern and aggressive union, with a majority of Indonesian members. This union later formed the base for the Indonesian communist movement. ISDV was strictly anti- capitalist and agitated against the Dutch colonial regime and the privileged Indonesian elites. This led to much resistance against the ISDV and Sneevliet himself, from conservative circles and from the more moderate SDAP. In 1916 therefore he left the SDAP and joined the SDP, the predecessor of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN). After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Sneevliet's radicalism gained enough support amongst both the Indonesian population as well as Dutch soldiers and especially sailors that the Dutch authorities got nervous. Sneevliet was therefore forced to leave the Dutch East Indies in 1918. ISDV was repressed by the Dutch colonial authorities. =Comintern functionary= Henk Sneevliet (top right, on the tribune) speaking before the Winter Palace in Petrograd in 1920. Trotsky is making the Russian translation. Back in the Netherlands, Sneevliet became active in the fledgling Communist movement, becoming a salaried official of the party's National Labor Secretariat (NAS) and helping to organize a major transportation strike in 1920. The same year he was also present at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow as a representative of the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), which was the successor to Sneevliet's ISDV. There Sneevliet ‚Äî using the pseudonym Maring ‚Äî was elected a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch (eds.), Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg.436. V.I. Lenin was impressed enough by him to send him as a Comintern representative to China, to aid in the formation of Communist Party of China. Sneevliet lived in China from 1921 to 1923 and was present at the founding congress of the Communist Party of China in July 1921. In addition to the pseudonym Maring, Sneevliet used the names Martin, Philips, and Sentot during this period. Sneevliet was an advocate of cooperation with the non-Communist nationalist Kuomintang, headed by Sun Yat-sen, with whom he had personally established contact on behalf of the Comintern. Early in 1924 Sneevliet returned to Moscow, his tenure as a Comintern representative to China at an end. =Back in the Netherlands= Sneevliet returned to the Netherlands from Moscow in 1924 to assume the position of secretary of the National Labor Secretariat (NAS). He joined the executive committee of the Communist Party of Holland in 1925 but the two years were marked by worsening factional relations between Sneevliet and his co-thinkers and the bulk of the CPN leadership. The denouement came in 1927, when Sneevliet broke all ties with the CPH and the Comintern. In 1929 Sneevliet formed a new political party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP).The RSP later became the Revolutionair Socialistische Arbeiders Partij (RSAP) after fusing with the Independent Socialist Party (OSP), which had earlier formed under the stewardship of Jacques de Kadt and . This organization concentrated on national issues, gaining some successes in organizing the unemployed movement, strike actions, and the struggle against the rise of fascism. He remained interested in Indonesian affairs and in 1933 was sentenced to five months imprisonment for his solidarity actions for the Dutch and Indonesian sailors who took part in the mutiny on \\"De Zeven Provinci√´n\\", which was put down by an air bombardment in which twenty-three sailors were killed and which at the time aroused considerable passions in the Dutch public opinion. That same year, while still imprisoned, Sneevliet was elected a member of the Lower House of parliament, a position in which he remained until 1937. In August 1933 the RSP signed the \\"Declaration of the Four\\" along with the International Communist League, led by Leon Trotsky, the OSP and the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. This declaration was intended as a step towards a new 4th International of revolutionary socialist parties. In Amsterdam, Sneevliet (as \\"Henricus\\" or \\"Henryk Sneevliet\\") was among Ignace Reiss's circle, which included: Henriette Roland-Holst, Hildo Krop, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, \\"Professor Carvalho\\" (Ricardo Carvalho Calero), \\"H. C. Pieck\\" (Henri Pieck). Reiss had a train ticket to visit Sneevliet when he (Reiss) was assassinated in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1937. In 1938 Sneevliet and the RSP ultimately refused to join this new international organization, however, thereby breaking with the Trotskyist movement. Instead the RSP became a part of the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Unity along with the Independent Labour Party (Britain) and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) of Spain. =Final years= The worsening political climate both abroad and nationally and the constant struggle against both the communist and social democratic parties, as well as government interference, took a heavy toll on Sneevliet and his small organization, however. When war broke out on 10 May 1940, Sneevliet immediately dissolved the RSAP. Some months later with Willem Dolleman and , he founded a resistance group against the German occupation, the Marx-Lenin-Luxemburg-Front (MLL- Front).Philippe Bourrinet, \\"The Marx-Lenin-Luxemburg Front\\", extract from Philippe Bourrinet, Dutch and German Communist Left on the Le Bataille socialiste website (accessed 2008-08-13) This was largely engaged in producing propaganda for socialism and opposing the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and as such was heavily involved with the February strike of 1941. Nazi execution As a known Communist, Sneevliet had to go into hiding even before he started his resistance activities. In the underground he edited a clandestine newspaper called Spartakus and took part in other activities. For two years he managed to keep out of the hands of the Nazis, but in April 1942 they finally arrested him and the rest of the MLL-Front leadership. Their execution took place in the Amersfoort KZ on 12 April 1942. It was reported that they went to their deaths singing \\"The Internationale\\".

Career Di Meola with Return to Forever at Onondaga Community College, Syracuse, New York, 1974 He attended Berklee College of Music in the early 1970s. At nineteen, he was hired by Chick Corea to replace Bill Connors in the pioneering jazz fusion band Return to Forever with Stanley Clarke and Lenny White. He recorded three albums with Return to Forever, helping the quartet earn its greatest commercial success as all three albums cracked the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard pop albums chart. He could play so fast, that he was sometimes criticized for playing too many notes. As Return to Forever was disbanding around 1976, Di Meola began recording solo albums on which he demonstrated mastery of jazz fusion, flamenco, and Mediterranean music. His album Elegant Gypsy (1977) received a gold certification. In 1980 he recorded the acoustic live album Friday Night in San Francisco with Paco de Luc√≠a and John McLaughlin. Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, and Paco de Luc√≠a performing in Barcelona, Spain in the 1980s In the beginning of his career, as evidenced on his first solo album Land of the Midnight Sun (1976), Di Meola was noted for his technical mastery and extremely fast, complex guitar solos and compositions. But even on his early albums, he had begun to explore Mediterranean cultures and acoustic genres like flamenco. Notable examples are \\"Mediterranean Sundance\\" and \\"Lady of Rome, Sister of Brazil\\" from the Elegant Gypsy album (1977). His early albums were influential among rock and jazz guitarists. Di Meola continued to explore Latin music within jazz fusion on Casino and Splendido Hotel. He exhibited a more subtle touch on acoustic numbers \\"Fantasia Suite for Two Guitars\\" from the Casino album and on the best-selling live album with McLaughlin and de Lucia, Friday Night in San Francisco. The latter album became one of the most popular live albums for acoustic guitar, selling more than two million copies worldwide. Di Meola at Leverkusener Jazztage (Forum/Leverkusen/Germany) on November 7, 2016 With Scenario, he explored the electronic side of jazz in a collaboration with Jan Hammer (keyboardist with Fusion pioneers \\"Mahavishnu Orchestra,\\" on albums with Jeff Beck, and later, composed the Miami Vice theme). Beginning with this change, he further expanded his horizons with the acoustic album Cielo e Terra. He began to incorporate the Synclavier guitar synthesizer on mid-1980s albums such as Soaring Through a Dream. By the 1990s, Di Meola recorded albums closer to world music and modern Latin styles than jazz. A notable exception was the 1991 album Kiss My Axe, which peaked at #2 on the US Contemporary Jazz Albums chart.

Miller graduated from Oberlin College (B.A. summa cum laude, 1948) and Harvard University (M.A. 1949, Ph.D. 1952). Miller is married and has three children.  Career  Miller has been an important humanities and literature scholar specializing in Victorian and Modernist literature, with a keen interest in the ethics of reading and reading as a cultural act. From 1952 to 1972, Miller taught at Johns Hopkins University. During this time, Miller was heavily influenced by fellow Johns Hopkins professor and Belgian literary critic Georges Poulet and the Geneva School of literary criticism, which Miller characterized as \\"the consciousness of the consciousness of another, the transposition of the mental universe of an author into the interior space of the critic's mind.\\"Vincent B. Leitch, ed., (2001). The Norton Anthology of Literary Criticism. \\"Georges Poulet.\\" New York: W.W. Norton & Company, pp. 1318-1319. In 1972, he joined the faculty at Yale University where he taught for fourteen years. At Yale, he worked alongside prominent literary critics Paul de Man and Geoffrey Hartman, where they were collectively known as the Yale School of deconstruction, in contention with prominent Yale influence theorist Harold Bloom. As a prominent American deconstructionist, Miller defines the movement as searching for \\"the thread in the text in question which will unravel it all,\\"Vincent B. Leitch (Ed.). (2001). The Norton Anthology of Literary Criticism. \\"Cleanth Brooks\\" 1352. and cites that there are multiple layers to any text, both its clear surface and its deep countervailing subtext: > On the one hand, the \\"obvious and univocal reading\\" always contains the > \\"deconstructive reading\\" as a parasite encrypted within itself as part of > itself.

Hillis Miller Currently, he is Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California Irvine.UCI E&CL; Faculty Profile  The Critic as Host  Miller's \\"The Critic as Host\\" could be viewed as a reply to M.H. Abrams, who presented a paper, \\"The Deconstructive Angel,\\" at a session of the Modern Language Association in December 1976, criticizing deconstruction and the methods of Miller. Miller presented his paper just after Abrams's presentation at the same session. In his essay \\"The Deconstructive Angel,\\" Abrams argued that there is a fixed univocal meaning for a text and if we use deconstructive strategies History will become impossibility. Miller replied that univocal and determinate meaning is impossibility and history is also impossibility. Every text is a vocalization of a vocalization. Miller asks a vital question at the beginning of his essay: when a text contains a citation from another text, is it like a parasite in the main text or is it the main text that surrounds and strangles the citation? Many people tend to see the deconstructionist reading as a parasite on its host, the univocal reading. Miller argues that deconstructionist reading is an essential and thoroughly naturalized ingredient in every reading, such that we cannot identify its presence. The word 'parasite' evokes the image of an ivy tree, the deconstructive reading that feeds on a mighty masculine oak, the univocal reading, and finally destroys the host. Miller rejects this view and calls this image inappropriate. Deconstructive reading is an essential and naturalized ingredient of every reading that we cannot identify its presence. He undertakes a brilliant etymological investigation of the word 'parasite' to prove his critics wrong. The word 'parasite' contains within itself its opposite. The prefix 'para' in the word parasite has many contradictory meanings. It simultaneously signifies proximity and distance. The word 'parasite' originated etymologically from the Greek 'parasitos'. The root means 'beside the grain'. 'Para' means beside and 'sitos' means grain or food. Originally 'parasite' was something positive. It simply meant someone who shares food with you, a fellow guest. The word 'host' has a more complex derivation. It meant a guest and a stranger, a friend with whom you have a reciprocal duty of hospitality, and a stranger and an enemy, and of course the holy Host. Miller shows that each word has a reciprocal, antithetical meaning built in, that these words are all intertwined in their etymology. The antithetical nature of the words 'host' and 'guest' shows the great complexity and equivocal richness of the apparently obvious and univocal language. The complexity and equivocal richness resides in the fact that language is basically figurative and metaphorical and hence it cannot represent reality directly and immediately. Deconstruction is an investigation of what is implied by this inherence of figure, concept and narrative in one another. Deconstruction is, therefore, a rhetorical discipline. There is a common view that a poem has a true original univocal reading and the secondary or the deconstructive reading is always parasitical on the first one. Miller, however, claims that there is no difference between both these readings. In his conception there is the poem and its various readings, all of which are equally valid or non-valid. The poem is the food and the two readings, both univocal and equivocal, are fellow guests near the food. Thus we get a triangular relation between the poem and its two readings, or the relation could be like a chain without a beginning or an end. Miller argues that an obvious univocal reading in the conventional sense is a myth. There is only deconstructive reading and it generates new meanings. The poem invites endless sequence of commentaries, which never arrives at a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô or final reading and meaning. Harold Bloom has formed a concept of the anxiety of influence to clarify the indebtedness of poets of a generation to the older generations. No poem can stand on its own, but always in relation to another.

History Six-man football was developed in 1934 by Stephen Epler in Chester, Nebraska, as an alternative means for small high schools to field a football team during the Great Depression. The first game was played on Thursday, September 27, 1934, at the Hebron, Nebraska Athletic Gridiron, under the lights, with a crowd of almost 1000 watching. This game was played so that coaches all over Kansas and Nebraska could see if they wanted to try this new game of six-man. The two teams playing in the game were the combined team from Hardy-Chester (\\"Hard-Chests\\") and a combined team from Belvidere-Alexandria (\\"Belvalex\\"). The two teams had two weeks to practice prior to this game; the two teams played to a 19-19 tie.http://hebronjournalregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/sept24a.pdf After that night, rules for the game were distributed to about 60,000 coaches in the United States.Franklin M. Reck, \\"Play Six Man Football\\" The American Boy\\": September 1937 p30 On October 5, 1940, Windham High School from Windham, Ohio, defeated Stamford Collegiate of Niagara Falls, Ontario, 39-1 in the first international six-man football game. Notable six-man players *Jack Pardee (April 19, 1936 ‚Äì April 1, 2013) began his football career as a teenager in Christoval, Texas, where he excelled as a member of the six-man football team.[1] He was an All-American linebacker at Texas A&M; University and a two-time All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams (1963) and the Washington Redskins (1971). He was one of the few six-man players to ever make it to the NFL, and his knowledge of that wide-open game served him well as a coach. Pardee was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986. Following his playing career, Pardee went on to coach, becoming the only head coach to helm a team in college football, the National Football League, the United States Football League, the World Football League, and the Canadian Football League. *Ed Sprinkle (September 3, 1923 ‚Äì July 28, 2014) played six- man football at Tuscola High School in 1939, and became known to many as \\"The Meanest Man in Pro Football\\", nicknamed \\"the Claw\\". Prior to his NFL career, Sprinkle won three letters in football and two in basketball and earned All- Border Conference while at Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University in the early 1940s. He earned all-Eastern honors in 1943 while attending the United States Naval Academy. He played for 12 seasons with the Chicago Bears of the National Football League and is credited with calling attention to the NFL's defensive players. At first, he played on both defense and offense. He caught 32 passes for 451 yards and seven touchdowns during his professional career. His ability to rush opposing quarterbacks, however, made him a defensive specialist, earning four Pro Bowls. Game play An American six-man playing field The two versions of six-man football are an American version and a Canadian one.https://saskatoonminorfootball.com/sixaside/rules.php Canadian six-man rules - Saskatoon Minor Football American six-man is played on an 80-yard-long (73-m) by 40-yard-wide (37-m) field in most circumstances; the high school rulebook allows games to be held on a normal 100-yd (91-m) by 53-yd (48.8-m) field used in 11-man football if the teams and leagues so choose. Furthermore, the game specifies a 15-yard distance (14-m) from the line of scrimmage to gain a first down, instead of the normal 10 yards (9 m). Canadian six-man is similar, but the length of the field can be either 100 or 110 yards long by 40 yards wide. End zones can be either 10 yards or up to 20 yards deep. Normal 12-man Canadian fields are 110 yards long and 65 yards wide, with 20 yard end zones. The Canadian game specifies the standard 10-yard distance to gain a first down, with the offense provided three downs to gain sufficient yardage rather than four downs as in the American game. All six players are eligible to be receivers in the American game, while in the Canadian game the player in the centre of the offensive line is ineligible. On offense, three linemen are required on the line of scrimmage at the start of the play. The player to whom the ball is snapped cannot advance the ball past the line of scrimmage (thus eliminating such plays as the bootleg or scramble); however, if the ball is tossed to another player, that player can run or throw the ball and the player to whom the ball was snapped is still an eligible receiver. All forward passes to the player who snapped the ball (center) must travel at least 1 yard (1 m) in flight. Scoring Scoring is the same as in 11-man football, with the exceptions being on the point after touchdown attempt and the field goal. A point-after kick is worth two points, while a conversion made by running or passing the ball is worth one point; this is the opposite of standard 11-man football. In addition, a field goal is worth four points instead of three. These rule changes were made because of the difficulty of successfully getting a kick off with so few blockers on the line compared to the number of defenders. In both University Interscholastic League and Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools competition, a 45-point \\"mercy rule\\" exists to prevent lopsided scoring deficits (no such rule exists in the standard 11-man game). The game is ended under this rule if a team is losing by 45 or more points at halftime or at any point after. The mercy rule is alluded to in the title of the David Morse film about six-man football, The Slaughter Rule. Scoring tends to be much higher in the six-man game compared to its 11-man counterpart; games in which one team scores 100 points or more, now extremely rare in 11-man, regularly occur several times a year in six-man. Six-man football today As of the 2017‚Äì2018 alignments from UIL, TAPPS, TAIAO, TCAF, and T-CAL, the state of Texas has 262 six-man football teams (69 in UIL Division I, 69 in UIL Division II, 52 in TAPPS 19 in TAIAO, 18 in TCAF and 17 in T-CAL);,http://t-cal.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std- content/repos/Top/TCAL%20Football%20District%20Alignments%20and%20Playoff%202013-2014%20School%20Year.pdf this does not count schools in other high-school leagues, or schools playing \\"outlaw schedules\\" (schools whose enrollment is too large to play six-man football in a league-sanctioned district, but nevertheless continue to organize a six-man team as opposed to an 11-man team). Texas Charter School Academic and Athletic League (TCSAAL) held its inaugural Six-Man Football Varsity State Championship on November 20, 2015, at East View High School in Georgetown, Texas, in which Inspired Vision Academy defeated West Columbia Charter School for the championship. TCSAAL held its second annual Six-Man Football State Championship on November 14, 2016, at Warrior Stadium at South Grand Prairie High School in Grand Prairie. Inspired Vision Academy defeated UME Preparatory 38-0 for their second consecutive TCSAAL Six-Man Varsity State Championship. The state of Florida has 32 teams playing six-man football in the Florida Christian Association of Private and Parochial Schools. FCAPPS comprises small Christian or private schools and at least one home-school cooperative. Teams in the conference are as far south as the Florida Keys to as far north as Jacksonville. The state of Alabama has eight teams playing as part of the Christian Football Association (www.cfafootball.org) which is a sister organization to the Alabama Christian Education Athletic Association (ACEAA). The state of Colorado has 23 teams currently playing six-man football, with the majority of teams being from small towns located in eastern Colorado. As of 2013, Idaho has two teams that play six-man football; they play against makeshift junior varsity teams or teams in Montana. Idaho has not sanctioned six-man football, but approved it for a pilot program. It was made particularly for schools that were small and too far removed geographically to have a reasonable co-operative program with a neighboring school. Idaho did play six-man football in the 1940s. The sport is also played by high schools in Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wyoming, and in parts of Canada. The most recent state or province to add six-man football is South Dakota, which reinstated the sport in 2019. As of 2013, no leagues (professional, semiprofessional, or amateur) play the game past the high-school level. The last one, the San Antonio-based Texas Sixman Football League, converted to eight-man football after the 2012 season. The Central Florida-based Southeastern Christian Association of Sixman Football ceased operations in the late 2000s, and the Pennsylvania 6-Man Football League also converted to eight-man around the same time. Currently, a women's league is playing six-(wo)man football ‚Äì the Independent Women's Football League. Six-man football in books In 2005, coach C.H. Underwood authored what is considered to be the definitive strategy and play book for the game, Six Man Football, published by Bright Sky Press. A player during the 1960s and coach of the first Texas State Six-Man Championship team in 1972, Underwood provides a thorough dissertation on the small-town sport from both analytical and historical perspectives. Another Bright Sky Press book, published in 2003, Grit and Glory: Six-Man Football, is a collection of photographs that capture the spirit of the game and its players. Grit and Glory exclusively showcases the work of art photographer Laura Wilson, mother of actors Owen, Luke, and Andrew Wilson. The newest release on the topic of six-man football is titled Six: A Football Coach's Journey to a National Record. The book was authored by Marc Rasmussen and published by the South Dakota State Historical Society Press. It includes a detailed history of Stephen Epler, the inventor of the sport, and follows the life of Willis \\"Bill\\" Welsh, who led a team from little Claremont, South Dakota, to a national record for consecutive wins between 1947 and 1953. More information is available on the South Dakota State Historical Society Press webpage (www.sdshspress.com). In 2009, Dee Kelly, wrote a fictional book, A Good Man's Sin, based on a boy moving from the city to the country and playing six-man football in Indian Gap, Texas, before making it to the NFL. It explains the rules of the game and small-town football. It portrays the mid-1970s six-man football teams in central Texas consistently to the teams of that time when Cherokee and Marathon were powerhouses. Barefoot, Bloodied and Bruised: The Amazing Story of Louisiana Six-Man Football is a self-published paperback written by longtime Louisiana football coach Barrett Murphy in 2014. This book is about six-man football adopted by small schools in rural Louisiana during the 1940s and 1950s. The backstories and the stories of the games themselves highlight the values of the times and provide poignant, funny, and inspirational lessons about how football shaped the lives of many who became part of the Greatest Generation. Six-man football in film The Slaughter Rule, released in 2002, used six- man football as played in Montana as the backdrop for an examination of the relationship between a fatherless renegade football player and his loner coach. The film contains a brief but adequate explanation of how the game of six-man football is played, as well as footage of actual game sequences. The title refers to a rule in which a game is called in the second half if one team gains a 45-point advantage over the other. In other states, it is referred to as the mercy rule. When invoked, one team is said to have \\"45ed\\" the other. Six Man, Texas, released in 2008, is a documentary film that explores six-man football as identity in the public high schools of the 160 small towns in Texas that play it. The Seventh Man, released in 2003, documents two years in the lives of the Panther Creek Panthers, one of the storied programs in Texas six-man football. It features the narration of Val Kilmer.

A native of West River, Shaw was educated at Prince of Wales College, the Nova Scotia Agricultural College and the University of Toronto. On his return to Prince Edward Island, he farmed for several years, becoming a noted livestock breeder. Shaw worked as a civil servant in the provincial department of agriculture from 1934 to 1954, rising to the position of deputy minister. He also helped found the PEI Federation of Agriculture serving as its first general secretary. He entered politics in 1957 when he was chosen leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. He led the party to victory in the 1959 election becoming the 22nd premier at the age of 71. The Shaw government supported the expansion of the province's food processing industry, instituted a regional system of high schools and revamped the employment system and pay scale for the civil service. Despite its support for the farming industry, Shaw's government failed to reverse the decline in the number of family farms and was unable to successfully diversify the economy. His government was defeated by the Liberal Party in 1966. Shaw stepped down as party leader in 1968, and was succeeded by George Key, although as Key was not a sitting member of the legislature Shaw continued to serve as leader of the opposition until 1970, when he retired at the age of 82. In 1971, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Shaw was inducted into the Canadian Agricultural Hall of Fame in 1980.

Stepwise magnification by 6% per frame into a 39-megapixel image. In the final frame, at about 170x, an image of a bystander is seen reflected in the man's cornea. Magnification is the process of enlarging the apparent size, not physical size, of something. This enlargement is quantified by a calculated number also called \\"magnification\\". When this number is less than one, it refers to a reduction in size, sometimes called minification or de-magnification. Typically, magnification is related to scaling up visuals or images to be able to see more detail, increasing resolution, using microscope, printing techniques, or digital processing. In all cases, the magnification of the image does not change the perspective of the image. Examples of magnification Some optical instruments provide visual aid by magnifying small or distant subjects. * A magnifying glass, which uses a positive (convex) lens to make things look bigger by allowing the user to hold them closer to their eye. * A telescope, which uses its large objective lens or primary mirror to create an image of a distant object and then allows the user to examine the image closely with a smaller eyepiece lens, thus making the object look larger. * A microscope, which makes a small object appear as a much larger image at a comfortable distance for viewing. A microscope is similar in layout to a telescope except that the object being viewed is close to the objective, which is usually much smaller than the eyepiece. * A slide projector, which projects a large image of a small slide on a screen. A photographic enlarger is similar. Magnification as a number (optical magnification) Optical magnification is the ratio between the apparent size of an object (or its size in an image) and its true size, and thus it is a dimensionless number. Optical magnification is sometimes referred to as \\"power\\" (for example \\"10√ó power\\"), although this can lead to confusion with optical power. =Linear or Transverse magnification= For real images, such as images projected on a screen, size means a linear dimension (measured, for example, in millimeters or inches). =Angular magnification= For optical instruments with an eyepiece, the linear dimension of the image seen in the eyepiece (virtual image in infinite distance) cannot be given, thus size means the angle subtended by the object at the focal point (angular size). Strictly speaking, one should take the tangent of that angle (in practice, this makes a difference only if the angle is larger than a few degrees). Thus, angular magnification is given by: \\\\mathrm{MA}=\\\\frac{\\\\tan \\\\varepsilon}{\\\\tan \\\\varepsilon_0} where {\\\\varepsilon_0} is the angle subtended by the object at the front focal point of the objective and {\\\\varepsilon} is the angle subtended by the image at the rear focal point of the eyepiece. For example, the mean angular size of the Moon's disk as viewed from Earth's surface is about 0.52¬∞. Thus, through binoculars with 10√ó magnification, the Moon appears to subtend an angle of about 5.2¬∞. By convention, for magnifying glasses and optical microscopes, where the size of the object is a linear dimension and the apparent size is an angle, the magnification is the ratio between the apparent (angular) size as seen in the eyepiece and the angular size of the object when placed at the conventional closest distance of distinct vision: 25 cm from the eye. A Thin lens where black dimensions are real, grey are virtual. The direction of the arrows can be used to describe cartesian +/- signage : from the centre of the lens, left or down = negative, right or up = positive. =By instrument= Single lens The linear magnification of a thin lens is M = {f \\\\over f-d_o} where f is the focal length and d_o is the distance from the lens to the object. Note that for real images, M is negative and the image is inverted. For virtual images, M is positive and the image is upright. With d_i being the distance from the lens to the image, h_i the height of the image and h_o the height of the object, the magnification can also be written as: M = -{d_i \\\\over d_o} = {h_i \\\\over h_o} Note again that a negative magnification implies an inverted image. Photography The image recorded by a photographic film or image sensor is always a real image and is usually inverted. When measuring the height of an inverted image using the cartesian sign convention (where the x-axis is the optical axis) the value for hi will be negative, and as a result M will also be negative. However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is \\"real is positive, virtual is negative\\". Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always real and positive. When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are virtual and negative. Therefore, the photographic magnification formulae are traditionally presented as M = {d_i \\\\over d_o} = {h_i \\\\over h_o} = {f \\\\over d_o-f} = {d_i-f \\\\over f} Telescope The angular magnification of an optical telescope is given by M= {f_o \\\\over f_e} in which f_o is the focal length of the objective lens in a refractor or of the primary mirror in a reflector, and f_e is the focal length of the eyepiece. Magnifying glass The maximum angular magnification (compared to the naked eye) of a magnifying glass depends on how the glass and the object are held, relative to the eye. If the lens is held at a distance from the object such that its front focal point is on the object being viewed, the relaxed eye (focused to infinity) can view the image with angular magnification \\\\mathrm{MA}={25\\\\ \\\\mathrm{cm}\\\\over f}\\\\quad Here, f is the focal length of the lens in centimeters. The constant 25 cm is an estimate of the \\"near point\\" distance of the eye--the closest distance at which the healthy naked eye can focus. In this case the angular magnification is independent from the distance kept between the eye and the magnifying glass. If instead the lens is held very close to the eye and the object is placed closer to the lens than its focal point so that the observer focuses on the near point, a larger angular magnification can be obtained, approaching \\\\mathrm{MA}={25\\\\ \\\\mathrm{cm}\\\\over f}+1\\\\quad A different interpretation of the working of the latter case is that the magnifying glass changes the diopter of the eye (making it myopic) so that the object can be placed closer to the eye resulting in a larger angular magnification. Microscope The angular magnification of a microscope is given by \\\\mathrm{MA}=M_o \\\\times M_e where M_o is the magnification of the objective and M_e the magnification of the eyepiece. The magnification of the objective depends on its focal length f_o and on the distance d between objective back focal plane and the focal plane of the eyepiece (called the tube length): M_o={d \\\\over f_o} The magnification of the eyepiece depends upon its focal length f_e and is calculated by the same equation as that of a magnifying glass (above). Note that both astronomical telescopes as well as simple microscopes produce an inverted image, thus the equation for the magnification of a telescope or microscope is often given with a minus sign. =Measurement of telescope magnification= Measuring the actual angular magnification of a telescope is difficult, but it is possible to use the reciprocal relationship between the linear magnification and the angular magnification, since the linear magnification is constant for all objects. The telescope is focused correctly for viewing objects at the distance for which the angular magnification is to be determined and then the object glass is used as an object the image of which is known as the exit pupil. The diameter of this may be measured using an instrument known as a Ramsden dynameter which consists of a Ramsden eyepiece with micrometer hairs in the back focal plane. This is mounted in front of the telescope eyepiece and used to evaluate the diameter of the exit pupil. This will be much smaller than the object glass diameter, which gives the linear magnification (actually a reduction), the angular magnification can be determined from :\\\\mathrm{MA} =1 / M = D_{\\\\mathrm{Objective}}/{D_\\\\mathrm{Ramsden}}. =Maximum usable magnification= With any telescope or microscope, or a lens a maximum magnification exists beyond which the image looks bigger but shows no more detail. It occurs when the finest detail the instrument can resolve is magnified to match the finest detail the eye can see. Magnification beyond this maximum is sometimes called \\"empty magnification\\". For a good quality telescope operating in good atmospheric conditions, the maximum usable magnification is limited by diffraction. In practice it is considered to be 2√ó the aperture in millimetres or 50√ó the aperture in inches; so, a 60mm diameter telescope has a maximum usable magnification of 120√ó. With an optical microscope having a high numerical aperture and using oil immersion, the best possible resolution is 200 nm corresponding to a magnification of around 1200√ó. Without oil immersion, the maximum usable magnification is around 800√ó. For details, see limitations of optical microscopes. Small, cheap telescopes and microscopes are sometimes supplied with the eyepieces that give magnification far higher than is usable. Magnification and micron bar Magnification figures on printed pictures can be misleading. Editors of journals and magazines routinely resize images to fit the page, making any magnification number provided in the figure legend incorrect. A scale bar (or micron bar) is a bar of stated length superimposed on a picture. This bar can be used to make accurate measurements on a picture. When a picture is resized the bar will be resized in proportion. If a picture has a scale bar, the actual magnification can easily be calculated. Where the scale (magnification) of an image is important or relevant, including a scale bar is preferable to stating magnification.

There are several ways proposed today to make nanosensors; these include top-down lithography, bottom-up assembly, and molecular self-assembly. There are different types of nanosensors in the market and in development for various applications, most notably in defense, environmental, and healthcare industries. These sensors share the same basic workflow: a selective binding of an analyte, signal generation from the interaction of the nanosensor with the bio-element, and processing of the signal into useful metrics.  Characteristics  Nanomaterials-based sensors have several benefits in sensitivity and specificity over sensors made from traditional materials, due to nanomaterial features not present in bulk material that arise at the nanoscale. Nanosensors can have increased specificity because they operate at a similar scale as natural biological processes, allowing functionalization with chemical and biological molecules, with recognition events that cause detectable physical changes. Enhancements in sensitivity stem from the high surface-to-volume ratio of nanomaterials, as well as novel physical properties of nanomaterials that can be used as the basis for detection, including nanophotonics. Nanosensors can also potentially be integrated with nanoelectronics to add native processing capability to the nanosensor. In addition to their sensitivity and specificity, nanosensors offer significant advantages in cost and response times, making them suitable for high-throughput applications. Nanosensors provide real-time monitoring compared to traditional detection methods such as chromatography and spectroscopy. These traditional methods may take days to weeks to obtain results and often require investment in capital costs as well as time for sample preparation. One-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanowires and nanotubes are well suited for use in nanosensors, as compared to bulk or thin-film planar devices. They can function both as transducers and wires to transmit the signal. Their high surface area can cause large signal changes upon binding of an analyte. Their small size can enable extensive multiplexing of individually addressable sensor units in a small device. Their operation is also \\"label free\\" in the sense of not requiring fluorescent or radioactive labels on the analytes. Zinc oxide nanowire is used for gas sensing applications, given that it exhibits high sensitivity toward low concentration of gas under ambient conditions and can be fabricated easily with low cost. There are several challenges for nanosensors, including avoiding drift and fouling, developing reproducible calibration methods, applying preconcentration and separation methods to attain a proper analyte concentration that avoids saturation, and integrating the nanosensor with other elements of a sensor package in a reliable manufacturable manner. Because nanosensors are a relatively new technology, there are many unanswered questions regarding nanotoxicology, which currently limits their application in biological systems. Potential applications for nanosensors include medicine, detection of contaminants and pathogens, and monitoring manufacturing processes and transportation systems. By measuring changes in physical properties (volume, concentration, displacement and velocity, gravitational, electrical, and magnetic forces, pressure, or temperature) nanosensors may be able to distinguish between and recognize certain cells at the molecular level in order to deliver medicine or monitor development to specific places in the body. The type of signal transduction defines the major classification system for nanosensors. Some of the main types of nanosensor readouts include optical, mechanical, vibrational, or electromagnetic.Lim, T.-C.; Ramakrishna, S. A Conceptual Review of Nanosensors. http://www.znaturforsch.com/aa/v61a/s61a0402.pdf. As an example of classification, nanosensors that use molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) can be divided into three categories, which are electrochemical, piezoelectric, or spectroscopic sensors. Electrochemical sensors induce a change in the electrochemical properties of the sensing material, which includes charge, conductivity, and electric potential. Piezoelectric sensors either convert mechanical force into electric force or vice versa. This force is then transduced into a signal. MIP spectroscopic sensors can be divided into three subcategories, which are chemiluminescent sensors, surface plasmon resonance sensors, and fluorescence sensors. As the name suggests, these sensors produce light based signals in forms of chemiluminescence, resonance, and fluorescence. As described by the examples, the type of change that the sensor detects and type of signal it induces depend on the type of sensor Overview of a general nanosensor workflow.  Mechanisms of operation  There are multiple mechanisms by which a recognition event can be transduced into a measurable signal; generally, these take advantage of the nanomaterial sensitivity and other unique properties to detect a selectively bound analyte. Electrochemical nanosensors are based on detecting a resistance change in the nanomaterial upon binding of an analyte, due to changes in scattering or to the depletion or accumulation of charge carriers. One possibility is to use nanowires such as carbon nanotubes, conductive polymers, or metal oxide nanowires as gates in field-effect transistors, although as of 2009 they had not yet been demonstrated in real-world conditions. Chemical nanosensors contain a chemical recognition system (receptor) and a physiochemical transducer, in which the receptor interacts with analyte to produce electrical signals.Chemical Sensors. http://nano- bio.ehu.es/files/chemical_sensors1.doc_definitivo.pdf (accessed Dec 6, 2018) In one case,Agnivo Gosai, Brendan Shin Hau Yeah, Marit Nilsen-Hamilton, Pranav Shrotriya, Label free thrombin detection in presence of high concentration of albumin using an aptamer-functionalized nanoporous membrane, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Volume 126, 2019, Pages 88-95, ISSN 0956-5663, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.10.010. upon interaction of the analyte with the receptor, the nanoporous transducer had a change in impedance which was determined as the sensor signal. Other examples include electromagnetic or plasmonic nanosensors, spectroscopic nanosensors such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, magnetoelectronic or spintronic nanosensors, and mechanical nanosensors. Biological nanosensors consist of a bio-receptor and a transducer. The transduction method of choice is currently fluorescence because of the high sensitivity and relative ease of measurement. The measurement can be achieved by using the following methods: binding active nanoparticles to active proteins within the cell, using site-directed mutagenesis to produce indicator proteins, allowing for real-time measurements, or by creating a nanomaterial (e.g. nanofibers) with attachment sites for the bio-receptors. Even though electrochemical nanosensors can be used to measure intracellular properties, they are typically less selective for biological measurements, as they lack the high specificity of bio- receptors (e.g. antibody, DNA). Photonic devices can also be used as nanosensors to quantify concentrations of clinically relevant samples. A principle of operation of these sensors is based on the chemical modulation of a hydrogel film volume that incorporates a Bragg grating. As the hydrogel swells or shrinks upon chemical stimulation, the Bragg grating changes color and diffracts light at different wavelengths. The diffracted light can be correlated with the concentration of a target analyte. Another type of nanosensor is one that works through a colorimetric basis. Here, the presence of the analyte causes a chemical reaction or morphological alteration for a visible color change to occur. One such application, is that gold nanoparticles can be used for the detection of heavy metals. Many harmful gases can also be detected by a colorimetric change, such as through the commercially available Dr√§ger Tube. These provide an alternative to bulky, lab-scale systems, as these can be miniaturized to be used for point-of-sample devices. For example, many chemicals are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and require extensive testing to ensure contaminant levels are within the appropriate limits. Colorimetric nanosensors provide a method for on-site determination of many contaminants. Production methods The production method plays a central role in determining the characteristics of the manufactured nanosensor in that the function of nanosensor can be made through controlling the surface of nanoparticles. There are two main approaches in the manufacturing of nanosensors: top-down methods, which begin with a pattern generated at a larger scale, and then reduced to microscale. Bottom-up methods start with atoms or molecules that build up to nanostructures. = Top-down methods =  Lithography  It involves starting out with a larger block of some material and carving out the desired form. These carved out devices, notably put to use in specific microelectromechanical systems used as microsensors, generally only reach the micro size, but the most recent of these have begun to incorporate nanosized components. One of the most common method is called electron beam lithography. Although very costly, this technique effectively forms a distribution of circular or ellipsoidal plots on the two dimensional surface. Another method is electrodeposition, which requires conductive elements to produce miniaturized devices.Pison, U., Giersig, M., & Schaefer, Alex. (2014). US 8846580 B2. Berlin, Germany.  Fiber pulling  This method consists in using a tension device to stretch the major axis of a fiber while it is heated, to achieve nano-sized scales. This method is specially used in optical fiber to develop optical-fiber-based nanosensors.  Chemical etching  Two different types of chemical etching have been reported. In the Turner method, a fiber is etched to a point while placed in the meniscus between hydrofluoric acid and an organic overlayer. This technique has been shown to produce fibers with large taper angles (thus increasing the light reaching the tip of the fiber) and tip diameters comparable to the pulling method. The second method is tube etching, which involves etching an optical fiber with a single-component solution of hydrogen fluoride. A silica fiber, surrounded with an organic cladding, is polished and one end is placed in a container of hydrofluoric acid. The acid then begins to etch away the tip of the fiber without destroying the cladding. As the silica fiber is etched away, the polymer cladding acts as a wall, creating microcurrents in the hydrofluoric acid that, coupled with capillary action, cause the fiber to be etched into the shape of a cone with large, smooth tapers. This method shows much less susceptibility to environmental parameters than the Turner method. = Bottom- up methods = This type of methods involve assembling the sensors out of smaller components, usually individual atoms or molecules. This is done by arranging atoms in specific patterns, which has been achieved in laboratory tests through use of atomic force microscopy, but is still difficult to achieve en masse and is not economically viable.  Self-assembly  Also known as ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù, this method most often entails an already complete set of components that would automatically assemble themselves into a finished product. Accurately being able to reproduce this effect for a desired sensor in a laboratory would imply that scientists could manufacture nanosensors much more quickly and potentially far more cheaply by letting numerous molecules assemble themselves with little or no outside influence, rather than having to manually assemble each sensor. Although the conventional fabrication techniques have proven to be efficient, further improvements in the production method can lead to minimization of cost and enhancement in performance. Challenges with current production methods include uneven distribution, size, and shape of nanoparticles, which all lead to limitation in performance. In 2006, researchers in Berlin patented their invention of a novel diagnostic nanosensor fabricated with nanosphere lithography (NSL), which allows precise control over size and shape of nanoparticles and creates nanoislands. The metallic nanoislands produced an increase in signal transduction and thus increased sensitivity of the sensor. The results also showed that the sensitivity and specification of the diagnostic nanosensor depend on the size of the nanoparticles, that decreasing the nanoparticle size increases the sensitivity. Applications One of the first working examples of a synthetic nanosensor was built by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1999. It involved attaching a single particle onto the end of a carbon nanotube and measuring the vibrational frequency of the nanotube both with and without the particle. The discrepancy between the two frequencies allowed the researchers to measure the mass of the attached particle. Since then, increasing amounts of research have gone into nanosensors, whereby modern nanosensors have been developed for many applications. Currently, the applications of nanosensors in the market include: healthcare, defense and military, and others such as food, environment, and agriculture.Technavio. Investment in the Global Nanosensors Market. 2017. Brief breakdown of current industry applications of nanosensors. = Defense and military = Nanoscience as a whole has many potential applications in the defense and military sector- including chemical detection, decontamination, and forensics. Some nanosensors in development for defense applications include nanosensors for the detection of explosives or toxic gases. Such nanosensors work on the principle that gas molecules can be distinguished based on their mass using, for example, piezoelectric sensors. If a gas molecule is adsorbed at the surface of the detector, the resonance frequency of the crystal changes and this can be measured as a change in electrical properties. In addition, field effect transistors, used as potentiometers, can detect toxic gases if their gate is made sensitive to them.Ngo C., Van de Voorde M.H. (2014) Nanotechnology for Defense and Security. In: Nanotechnology in a Nutshell. Atlantis Press, Paris In a similar application, nanosensors can be utilized in military and law enforcement clothing and gear. The Navy Research Laboratory's Institute for Nanoscience has studied quantum dots for application in nanophotonics and identifying biological materials. Nanoparticles layered with polymers and other receptor molecules will change color when contacted by analytes such as toxic gases. This alerts the user that they are in danger. Other projects involve embedding clothing with biometric sensors to relay information regarding the user's health and vitals, which would be useful for monitoring soldiers in combat. Surprisingly, some of the most challenging aspects in creating nanosensors for defense and military use are political in nature, rather than technical. Many different government agencies must work together to allocate budgets and share information and progress in testing; this can be difficult with such large and complex institutions. In addition, visas and immigration status can become an issue for foreign researchers - as the subject matter is very sensitive, government clearance can sometimes be required.Carafano, J. Nanotechnology and National Security: Small Changes, Big Impact. https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/nanotechnology-and-national- security-small-changes-big-impact (accessed Dec 3, 2018) Finally, there are currently not well defined or clear regulations on nanosensor testing or applications in the sensor industry, which contributes to the difficulty of implementation. = Food and the environment = Nanosensors can improve various sub-areas within food and environment sectors including food processing, agriculture, air and water quality monitoring, and packaging and transport. Due to their sensitivity, as well as their tunability and resulting binding selectivity, nanosensors are very effective and can be designed for a wide variety of environmental applications. Such applications of nanosensors help in a convenient, rapid, and ultrasensitive assessment of many types of environmental pollutants. Chemical sensors are useful for analyzing odors from food samples and detecting atmospheric gases. The \\"electronic nose\\" was developed in 1988 to determine the quality and freshness of food samples using traditional sensors, but more recently the sensing film has been improved with nanomaterials. A sample is placed in a chamber where volatile compounds become concentrated in the gas phase, whereby the gas is then pumped through the chamber to carry the aroma to the sensor that measures its unique fingerprint. The high surface area to volume ratio of the nanomaterials allows for greater interaction with analytes and the nanosensor's fast response time enables the separation of interfering responses.Ramgir, N. S. ISRN Nanomaterials 2013, 2013, 1‚Äì21. Chemical sensors, too, have been built using nanotubes to detect various properties of gaseous molecules. Many carbon nanotube based sensors are designed as field effect transistors, taking advantage of their sensitivity. The electrical conductivity of these nanotubes will change due to charge transfer and chemical doping by other molecules, enabling their detection. To enhance their selectivity, many of these involve a system by which nanosensors are built to have a specific pocket for another molecule. Carbon nanotubes have been used to sense ionization of gaseous molecules while nanotubes made out of titanium have been employed to detect atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen at the molecular level. Some of these have been designed as field effect transistors, while others take advantage of optical sensing capabilities. Selective analyte binding is detected through spectral shift or fluorescence modulation. In a similar fashion, Flood et al. have shown that supramolecular host‚Äìguest chemistry offers quantitative sensing using Raman scattered light as well as SERS. Other types of nanosensors, including quantum dots and gold nanoparticles, are currently being developed to detect pollutants and toxins in the environment. These take advantage of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that arises at the nanoscale, which results in wavelength specific absorption. This LSPR spectrum is particularly sensitive, and its dependence on nanoparticle size and environment can be used in various ways to design optical sensors. To take advantage of the LSPR spectrum shift that occurs when molecules bind to the nanoparticle, their surfaces can be functionalized to dictate which molecules will bind and trigger a response. For environmental applications, quantum dot surfaces can be modified with antibodies that bind specifically to microorganisms or other pollutants. Spectroscopy can then be used to observe and quantify this spectrum shift, enabling precise detection, potentially on the order of molecules. Similarly, fluorescent semiconducting nanosensors may take advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to achieve optical detection. Quantum dots can be used as donors, and will transfer electronic excitation energy when positioned near acceptor molecules, thus losing their fluorescence. These quantum dots can be functionalized to determine which molecules will bind, upon which fluorescence will be restored. Gold nanoparticle-based optical sensors can be used to detect heavy metals very precisely; for example, mercury levels as low as 0.49 nanometers. This sensing modality takes advantage of FRET, in which the presence of metals inhibits the interaction between quantum dots and gold nanoparticles, and quenches the FRET response. Another potential implementation takes advantage of the size dependence of the LSPR spectrum to achieve ion sensing. In one study, Liu et al. functionalized gold nanoparticles with a Pb2+ sensitive enzyme to produce a lead sensor. Generally, the gold nanoparticles would aggregate as they approached each other, and the change in size would result in a color change. Interactions between the enzyme and Pb2+ ions would inhibit this aggregation, and thus the presence of ions could be detected. The main challenge associated with using nanosensors in food and the environment is determining their associated toxicity and overall effect on the environment. Currently, there is insufficient knowledge on how the implementation of nanosensors will affect the soil, plants, and humans in the long-term. This is difficult to fully address because nanoparticle toxicity depends heavily on the type, size, and dosage of the particle as well as environmental variables including pH, temperature, and humidity. To mitigate potential risk, research is being done to manufacture safe, nontoxic nanomaterials, as part of an overall effort towards green nanotechnology. = Healthcare = Nanosensors possess great potential for diagnostic medicine, enabling early identification of disease without reliance on observable symptoms. Ideal nanosensor implementations look to emulate the response of immune cells in the body, incorporating both diagnostic and immune response functionalities, while transmitting data to allow for monitoring of the sensor input and response. However, this model remains a long-term goal, and research is currently focused on the immediate diagnostic capabilities of nanosensors. The intracellular implementation of nanosensor synthesized with biodegradable polymers induces signals that enable real-time monitoring and thus paves way for advancement in drug delivery and treatment. One example of these nanosensors involves using the fluorescence properties of cadmium selenide quantum dots as sensors to uncover tumors within the body. A downside to the cadmium selenide dots, however, is that they are highly toxic to the body. As a result, researchers are working on developing alternate dots made out of a different, less toxic material while still retaining some of the fluorescence properties. In particular, they have been investigating the particular benefits of zinc sulfide quantum dots which, though they are not quite as fluorescent as cadmium selenide, can be augmented with other metals including manganese and various lanthanide elements. In addition, these newer quantum dots become more fluorescent when they bond to their target cells. Another application of nanosensors involves using silicon nanowires in IV lines to monitor organ health. The nanowires are sensitive to detect trace biomarkers that diffuse into the IV line through blood which can monitor kidney or organ failure. These nanowires would allow for continuous biomarker measurement, which provides some benefits in terms of temporal sensitivity over traditional biomarker quantification assays such as ELISA.Bourzac, K. Nanosensors for Medical Monitoring. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410426/nanosensors-for- medical-monitoring/. 2016. Nanosensors can also be used to detect contamination in organ implants. The nanosensor is embedded into the implant and detects contamination in the cells surrounding the implant through an electric signal sent to a clinician or healthcare provider. The nanosensor can detect whether the cells are healthy, inflammatory, or contaminated with bacteria.McIntosh, J. Nanosensors: the future of diagnostic medicine? https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299663.php. 2017 However, a main drawback is found within the long term use of the implant, where tissue grows on top of the sensors, limiting their ability to compress. This impedes the production of electrical charges, thus shortening the lifetime of these nanosensors, as they use the piezoelectric effect to self-power. Similarly to those used to measure atmospheric pollutants, gold-particle based nanosensors are used to give an early diagnosis to several types of cancer by detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath, as tumor growth is associated with peroxidation of the cell membrane. Another cancer related application, though still in mice probing stage, is the use of peptide-coated nanoparticles as activity-based sensors to detect lung cancer. The two main advantages of the use of nanoparticles to detect diseases is that it allows early stage detection, as it can detect tumors the size in the order of millimeters. It also provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use, portable, and non-invasive diagnostic tool. A recent effort towards advancement in nanosensor technology has employed molecular imprinting, which is a technique used to synthesize polymer matrices that act as a receptor in molecular recognition. Analogous to the enzyme-substrate lock and key model, molecular imprinting uses template molecules with functional monomers to form polymer matrices with specific shape corresponding to its target template molecules, thus increasing the selectivity and affinity of the matrices. This technique has enabled nanosensors to detect chemical species. In the field of biotechnology, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) are synthesized receptors that have shown promising, cost-effective alternatives to natural antibodies in that they are engineered to have high selectivity and affinity. For example, an experiment with MI sensor containing nanotips with non-conductive polyphenol nano-coating (PPn coating) showed selective detection of E7 protein and thus demonstrated potential use of these nanosensors in detection and diagnosis of human papillomavirus, other human pathogens, and toxins. As shown above, nanosensors with molecular imprinting technique are capable of selectively detecting ultrasensitive chemical species in that by artificially modifying the polymer matrices, molecular imprinting increases the affinity and selectivity. Although molecularly imprinted polymers provide advantages in selective molecular recognition of nanosensors, the technique itself is relatively recent and there still remains challenges such as attenuation signals, detection systems lacking effective transducers, and surfaces lacking efficient detection. Further investigation and research on the field of molecularly imprinted polymers is crucial for development of highly effective nanosensors. In order to develop smart health care with nanosensors, a network of nanosensors, often called nanonetwork, need to be established to overcome the size and power limitations of individual nanosensors. Nanonetworks not only mitigates the existing challenges but also provides numerous improvements. Cell-level resolution of nanosensors will enable treatments to eliminate side effects, enable continuous monitoring and reporting of patients‚Äô conditions. Nanonetworks require further study in that nanosensors are different from traditional sensors. The most common mechanism of sensor networks are through electromagnetic communications. However, the current paradigm is not applicable to nanodevices due to their low range and power. Optical signal transduction has been suggested as an alternative to the classical electromagnetic telemetry and has monitoring applications in human bodies. Other suggested mechanisms include bioinspired molecular communications, wired and wireless active transport in molecular communications, Forster energy transfer, and more. It is crucial to build an efficient nanonetwork so that it can be applied in fields such as medical implants, body area networks (BAN), internet of nano things (IoNT), drug delivery and more. With an adept nanonetwork, bio implantable nanodevices can provide higher accuracy, resolution, and safety compared to macroscale implants. Body area networks (BAN) enable sensors and actuators to collect physical and physiological data from the human body to better anticipate any diseases, which will thus facilitate the treatment. Potential applications of BAN include cardiovascular disease monitoring, insulin management, artificial vision and hearing, and hormonal therapy management. The Internet of Bio-Nano Things refers to networks of nanodevices that can be accessed by the internet. Development of IoBNT has paved the way to new treatments and diagnostic techniques. Nanonetworks may also help drug delivery by increasing localization and circulation time of drugs. Existing challenges with the aforementioned applications include biocompatibility of the nano implants, physical limitations leading to lack of power and memory storage, and bio compatibility of the transmitter and receiver design of IoBNT. The nanonetwork concept has numerous areas for improvements: these include developing nanomachines, protocol stack issues, power provisioning techniques, and more. There are still stringent regulations in place for the development of standards for nanosensors to be used in the medical industry, due to insufficient knowledge of the adverse effects of nanosensors as well as potential cytotoxic effects of nanosensors. Additionally, there can be a high cost of raw materials such as silicon, nanowires, and carbon nanotubes, which prevent commercialization and manufacturing of nanosensors requiring scale-up for implementation. To mitigate the drawback of cost, researchers are looking into manufacturing nanosensors made of more cost-effective materials. There is also a high degree of precision needed to reproducibly manufacture nanosensors, due to their small size and sensitivity to different synthesis techniques, which creates additional technical challenges to be overcome.

The company was one of the first to prohibit the use of ingredients tested on animals in some of its products and one of the first to promote fair trade with developing countries. Roddick was involved in activism and campaigning for environmental and social issues, including involvement with Greenpeace and The Big Issue. In 1990, Roddick founded Children on the Edge, a charitable organisation which helps disadvantaged children in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. She believed that business should offer a form of moral leadership, being a more powerful force in society than religion or government. In the late 1990s, she became involved in advocating for the Angola Three, African-American prisoners at the Louisiana State Penitentiary who had already been held in solitary confinement for decades. She helped raise international awareness and funds to aid in their appeals of flawed trials. The Body Shop Anita Roddick opened the first Body Shop in 1976, with the goal of earning an income for herself and her two daughters while her husband was away in South America. She wanted to provide quality skin care products in refillable containers and sample sizes, all marketed with truth rather than hype.Anita Roddick, Body and Soul, 1991. She opened her second shop six months later. On her husband's return, he joined the business. By 1991, the Body Shop had 700 branches, and Roddick was awarded the 1991 World Vision Award for Development Initiative. In 1996 she told Third Way: In 1997, Anita Rodick developed the Body Shop's most successful campaign ever, creating Ruby, the size 16 doll, who was thought to bear a passing resemblance to Barbie. The campaign evolved from positioning developed by ethical communications consultancy Host Universal. They created the image of the naked red-haired doll, hands behind her head and wind in her hair, that became the embodiment of the campaign. The photographer was Steve Perry. By 2004, the Body Shop had 1980 stores, serving more than 77 million customers throughout the world. It was voted the second most-trusted brand in the United Kingdom, and 28th top brand in the world. On 17 March 2006, L'Or√©al purchased Body Shop for ¬£652 million. Some controversy and criticism was raised, as L'Or√©al was known to use animal testing and the company was part- owned by Nestl√©. The latter had been criticised for its treatment of third- world producers. Roddick addressed the issues directly in an interview with The Guardian. It reported that > \\"she sees herself as a kind of 'Trojan horse' who by selling her business to > a huge firm will be able to influence the decisions it makes. Suppliers who > had formerly worked with the Body Shop will in future have contracts with > L'Or√©al, and whilst working with the company 25 days a year Roddick was able > to have an input into decisions.\\"business.guardian.co.uk Charity work Roddick was known for her campaigning work on environmental issues and was a member of the Demos think tank's advisory council. In 1990 Roddick founded Children on the Edge (COTE), in response to her visits to Romanian orphanages. She created COTE to help manage the crisis of poor conditions in the overcrowded orphanages and worked to de-institutionalise the children over the course of their early life. COTE's mission is to help disadvantaged children affected by conflicts, natural disasters, disabilities, and HIV/AIDS. In the late 1990s, Roddick became involved in the case of the Angola Three, African-American men who had been held for more than two decades in solitary confinement at Louisiana State Penitentiary. She helped raise international awareness of their case and funds to support appeals of their flawed convictions.Erwin James, \\"37 years of solitary confinement: the Angola three\\", The Guardian, 10 March 2010; accessed 12 December 2017 On 13 December 2005, the National Post reported that Roddick had announced that she intended to use her fortune for philanthropy; it was estimated at ¬£51 million ($104 million). This was before her sale of her business to L'Oreal. Roddick wrote the book Take It Personally. She encouraged equality and an end to the exploitation of workers and children in underdeveloped countries. After her death in 2007, her husband, Gordon Roddick, founded 38 Degrees in her memory. He said, \\"I knew what would make Anita really laugh would be to cause a lot of trouble.\\" Between 2009 and 2014, the Roddick Foundation gave four grants totalling ¬£120,000 to CAGE, an organisation led by Mozzam Begg, that aimed \\"to raise awareness of the plight of the prisoners at Guant√°namo Bay and other detainees held as part of the War on Terror\\". The Foundation, along with two other charities, agreed to cease funding CAGE under pressure from the Charity Commission, which had expressed concern that funding CAGE risked damaging public confidence in charity. Lord Carlile, formerly the British Government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: \\"I would never advise anybody to give money to CagePrisoners. I have concerns about the group\\". In 2015, the charity commission agreed to cease to interfere with charities' right to fund CAGE, if they wished, following a judicial review. The judicial review heard testimony that a British Cabinet Minister and US intelligence had applied pressure on the charity commission to investigate CAGE. Roddick was a close friend of Littlehampton Community School. In 2003, it successfully applied to become a Business and Enterprise specialist school. Much of the money required was donated by Roddick. As a result of this donation, a new building built with this money was named The Roddick Enterprise Centre (normally abbreviated to 'REC'). The Littlehampton College also hosts 'Roddick Days' such as 'Day of Action' and 'One World'; these events allow students to give something back to their local community and learn about what is happening around them. Illness In 2004, Roddick was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis due to long-standing hepatitis C. She did not reveal her illness until 14 February 2007. Roddick said, \\"I have hepatitis C. It's a bit of a bummer, but you groan and move on\\". She subsequently promoted the work of The Hepatitis C Trust, and campaigned to increase awareness of the disease. On 30 August 2007, less than two weeks before her death, Roddick was a special guest in an episode of the live television programme Doctor, Doctor broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. She discussed hepatitis C with the presenter and general practitioner, Mark Porter.Doctor, Doctor. Five TV. Roddick explained that her hepatitis C was unexpectedly diagnosed in 2004, following a blood test that was part of a medical examination needed for a life insurance policy. The blood test indicated abnormal liver function and subsequent blood tests diagnosed hepatitis C. Roddick explained that she had a large blood transfusion in 1971, after the birth of her younger daughter, and that she was convinced that the transfusion had infected her with hepatitis C. This was about twenty years before blood donors in the United Kingdom were screened for hepatitis C. She reported that she had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and that her main symptoms were itching and poor concentration. She briefly mentioned that medical treatment with interferon did not suit her. Roddick explained that she kept fit and active, and that she attended biannual out- patient hospital appointments in Southampton, as well as being under review by the liver transplant team at the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Death and legacy Roddick died of acute brain haemorrhage at about 6:30 p.m. on 10 September 2007, after being admitted to St Richard's Hospital, Chichester the previous evening suffering from a severe headache. As promised earlier, she left her estate to charities rather than to her family and friends. When details of her estate were published, it was disclosed that she had donated all of her ¬£51 million fortune upon her death. Controversies In a May 2002 article in The Globe and Mail, Jon Entine reported that Roddick had copied the name, concept and original brochures from the original Body Shop, which was started in Berkeley, California and had three stores when Roddick visited the Bay Area in the early 1970s. Roddick's original brochures were verbatim copies of material produced by the Berkeley-based Body Shop. When Roddick decided to expand her multi-national corporation into the United States, she bought the rights to the Body Shop name for $3.5 million from the original shop owners. They were required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time.Made in Berkeley: The Original Body Shop, Berkeley Daily Planet 2004-02-03 The American Body Shop renamed itself as Body Time, and remained in operation until April 2018. Entine also noted that Roddick's The Body Shop did not make charitable donations for its first 11 years of operation, although Roddick had made statements to the contrary. The Body Shop opened in Brighton in March 1976. The company entered the stock exchange in 1984. The first sponsorship, which was made possible by the wealth generated by the IPO, was for Greenpeace posters in 1985.

(November 4, 1806 ‚Äì February 23, 1864) was a pioneer Italian Dominican friar and Catholic missionary priest who helped bring the church to the Iowa-Illinois-Wisconsin tri-state area. He founded a number of parishes in the area, and was the architect for a number of parish buildings. Additionally, Mazzuchelli founded a number of schools throughout the region, some of which have developed into local Catholic colleges. As part of this effort, he founded the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters. Life =Early life= Fr. Mazzuchelli historical marker He was born Carlo Gaetano Samuele Mazzuchelli on November 4, 1806, in Milan‚Äîthen under French control, the 16th of 17 children of a prominent family. At the age of 17 he entered the Dominican Order, which was still recovering from the devastation wrought on institutions of the Catholic Church in Italy under the French Revolutionary Army. After his period of novitiate, when he changed his name to Friar Samuel, he went to Rome to prepare for ordination. He was ordained a subdeacon in 1827 in the Lateran Basilica, around which time he was recruited to serve in new Diocese of Cincinnati, still missionary territory for the Church. After spending some time in France to perfect his French, in 1828 Mazzuchelli set out for the United States, where he arrived in Cincinnati, and was welcomed by the bishop, his fellow Dominican friar, Edward Fenwick. =Missionary priest= After obtaining a dispensation from the Holy See due to his being underage, Mazzuchelli was ordained a priest by Fenwick on September 5, 1830. Shortly after that, he was sent to serve at Sainte Anne Church on Mackinac Island and later in northern Wisconsin, After about five years there, Mazzuchelli arrived in the Dubuque area. During his time, he faced a number of challenges, such as hostility from other Christian denominations. While in what would later become Dubuque, Iowa, he reorganized the parish and named it Saint Raphael, which later became the Cathedral parish when the Dubuque Diocese was formed in 1837. He assisted Bishop Mathias Loras during the first few years after the founding of the Diocese and worked extensively in what would eventually become the Diocese of Madison, Wisconsin. There he founded over 30 parishes and designed and built over 20 church buildings, along with a number of civic buildings. Three of those parishes were named after the three Archangels: Saint Raphael's in Dubuque, St. Michael's in Galena, Illinois, and Saint Gabriel's in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. In 1846, he founded Sinsinawa Mound College. In 1847, he founded the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters. In 1848, he founded St. Clara Female Academy (now Dominican University), a frontier school for young women, which he entrusted to the Dominican Sisters. Many remembered Mazzuchelli as a kind and gentlemanly priest. He was able to break down the cultural barriers that existed at the time and appeal to many different ethnic groups. The Irish he ministered to called him \\"Father Matthew Kelly\\".\\"Term: Father Samuel Mazzuchelli\\" Dictionary of Wisconsin History He died on February 23, 1864 after contracting an illness from a sick parishioner. Mazzuchelli was buried at St. Patrick's Cemetery in Benton. Veneration Fr. Mazzuchelli's grave in Benton, Wisconsin Over the years a case for elevating him to Sainthood has been pending with the church. It started in 1964, when William Patrick O'Connor, the first Bishop of Madison, established a Diocesan Historical Commission to determine if documents available were sufficient for the Church to proceed with initial steps required in the process of beatification. The process progressed and was accepted by the Holy See for further investigation. In 1993, Pope John Paul II declared Mazzuchelli Venerable. In preparation for the 200th anniversary of Mazzuchelli's birth in November 2006, those campaigning for Mazzuchelli to be elevated to sainthood began a number of activities to draw attention to that particular cause. The Sinsinawa Dominican sisters have been particularly active in this campaign. In August 2008, an official inquiry into a presumed miracle performed through the intercession of Mazzuchelli was completed in the Diocese of Madison. Robert Uselmann, a resident of Monona, Wisconsin had gone to Sinsinawa Mound with his family in 2001 to pray to Mazzuchelli for his intercession in curing him of cancer. While there he prayed with the Sisters, using Mazzuchelli's penance chain. Uselmann later discovered that a cancerous tumor had disappeared from his lung. Robert C. Morlino, Bishop of the Diocese of Madison, opened a diocesan tribunal at the request of the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters, which concluded its non-judgmental investigation and sent the results to Rome. If the Congregation for the Causes of Saints rules that Uselmann's healing is judged miraculous, Mazzuchelli would be eligible for beatification, the next step in the process of naming a saint within the Church. Legacy In 2006 a new middle school built by the Holy Family Catholic School System in Dubuque was named after Mazzuchelli. The school opened for the 2006‚Äì2007 academic year.Middle School Named in Honor of Fr. Mazzuchelli Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters website =Parishes founded by Fr.

This division into old vs. new content is called information structure. It is generally agreed that clauses are divided into topic vs. comment, but in certain cases the boundary between them depends on which specific grammatical theory is being used to analyze the sentence. Topic, which is defined by pragmatic considerations, is a distinct concept from grammatical subject, which is defined by syntax. In any given sentence these may be the same, but they need not be. For example, in the sentence \\"As for the little girl, the dog bit her\\", the subject is \\"the dog\\" but the topic is \\"the little girl\\". Topic and subject are also distinct concepts from agent (or actor)‚Äîthe \\"doer\\", which is defined by semantics. In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition by. For example, in the sentence \\"The little girl was bitten by the dog\\", \\"the little girl\\" is the subject and the topic, but \\"the dog\\" is the agent. In some languages, word order and other syntactic phenomena are determined largely by the topic‚Äìcomment (theme‚Äìrheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as topic-prominent languages. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.  Definitions and examples  The sentence- or clause-level \\"topic\\", or \\"theme\\", can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are *a) the phrase in a clause that the rest of the clause is understood to be about, *b) a special position in a clause (often at the right or left-edge of the clause) where topics typically appear. In an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2): *(1) The dog bit the little girl. *(2) The little girl was bitten by the dog. These clauses have different topics: the first is about the dog, and the second about the little girl. In English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following: *(3) As for the little girl, the dog bit her. *(4) It was the little girl that the dog bit. The case of expletives is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like: *(6) It is raining. *(7) There is some room in this house. *(8) There are two days in the year in which the day and the night are equal in length. In these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive (\\"it\\" or \\"there\\"), whose sole purpose is satisfying the extended projection principle, and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined pragmatically. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part.Michael Gotze, Stephanie Dipper, and Stavros Skopeteas. 2007. Information Structure in Cross-Linguistic Corpora: Annotation Guidelines for Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Information Structure. Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure (ISIS), Working papers of the SFB 632, Vol. 7. The relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic- comment relation in Rhetorical Structure Theory-Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as \\"a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic\\". For example: \\"[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]\\"L. Carlson and D. Marcu, ‚ÄúDiscourse tagging reference manual,‚Äù ISI Technical Report ISI-TR-545, vol. 54, 2001.L. Ermakova and J. Mothe. 2016. Document re- ranking based on topic-comment structure. In X IEEE International Conference RCIS, Grenoble, France, June 1‚Äì3, 2016. 1‚Äì10.  Realization of topic‚Äìcomment  Different languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially (\\"topic fronting\\") is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning of a clause regardless whether it is marked or not.D. Bring, Topic and Comment. Cambridge University Press, 2011, three entries for: Patrick Colm Hogan (ed.) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the Language Sciences. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Again, linguists disagree on many details. Languages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics. When a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects. In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show pro-drop. = In English = The topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.MAK Halliday (1994). An introduction to functional grammar, 2nd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, p. 37 = In other languages= * Japanese and Korean: the topic is normally marked with a postposition such as or Îäî/ÏùÄ, -(n)eun. * In Ivorian French, the topic is marked by the postposition ¬´ l√† ¬ª. The topic can be a noun or a nominal group but not necessarily : ¬´ Voiture-l√† est jolie deh ¬ª ; ¬´ Aujourd'hui-l√† il fait chaud ¬ª ; ¬´ Pour toi-l√† n'est pas comme pour moi hein ¬ª ; ¬´ Nous qui sommes ici-l√†, on attend √ßa seulement ¬ª. * So-called free-word order languages (e.g. Russian, Czech, to a certain extent Chinese and German) use word-order as the primary means. Usually the topic precedes focus. For example, in some Slavic languages such as Czech and Russian both orders are possible. The order with comment sentence-initial is referred as subjective (Vil√©m Mathesius invented the term and opposed it to objective) and expresses certain emotional involvement. The two orders are distinguished by intonation. * In modern Hebrew, a topic may follow its comment. In this case, the syntactic subject of the sentence is an expletive ◊ñ◊î (\\"ze\\", lit. \\"this\\"). For example, ◊ñ◊î ◊û◊ê◊ì ◊û◊¢◊†◊ô◊ü ◊î◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊ñ◊î \\"ze me æod me øanyen ha-sefer ha-ze\\" (lit. \\"This is very interesting this book\\") means \\"This book is very interesting\\". * In American Sign Language, a topic can be declared at the beginning of a sentence (indicated by raised eyebrows and head tilt) describing the object, then the rest of the sentence describes what happens to that object.  Practical applications  The main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture).Cassell, Justine, ed. Embodied conversational agents. MIT press, 2000. There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for information retrieval A. Bouchachia and R. Mittermeir, ‚ÄúA neural cascade architecture for document retrieval,‚Äù in Neural Networks, 2003. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on, vol. 3. IEEE, 2003, pp. 1915‚Äì1920. and automatic summarization.L. Ermakova, J. Mothe, A. Firsov. A Metric for Sentence Ordering Assessment Based on Topic-Comment Structure, in ACM SIGIR, Tokyo, Japan, 07/08/2017-11/08/2017 History The distinction between subject and topic was probably first suggested by Henri Weil in 1844.H. Weil, De l‚Äôordre des mots dans les langues anciennes compares aux langues modernes: question de grammaire gnrale. Joubert, 1844. He established the connection between information structure and word order. Georg von der Gabelentz distinguished psychological subject (roughly topic) and psychological object (roughly focus). In the Prague school, the dichotomy, termed topic‚Äìfocus articulation, has been studied mainly by Vil√©m Mathesius,V. Mathesius and J. Vachek, A Functional Analysis of Present Day English on a General Linguistic Basis, ser. Janua linguarum : Series practica / Ianua linguarum / Series practica. Mouton, 1975. Jan Firbas, Franti≈°ek Dane≈°, Petr Sgall and Eva Hajiƒçov√°. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. Mathesius also pointed out that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of Michael Halliday in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his systemic functional linguistics model for English.M.A.K.Halliday, An Introduction to Functional Grammar, 2nd ed.

He helped develop the video tape recorder while at Ampex and was the founder of Dolby Laboratories. Early life Dolby was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Esther Eufemia (n√©e Strand) and Earl Milton Dolby, an inventor. He attended Sequoia High School (class of 1951) in Redwood City, California. As a teenager in the decade following World War II, he held part-time and summer jobs at Ampex in Redwood City, Biography of Ray Dolby working with their first audio tape recorder in 1949. While at San Jose State College and later at Stanford University (interrupted by two years of Army service), he worked on early prototypes of video tape recorder technologies for Alexander M. Poniatoff and Charlie Ginsburg. As a non degree-holding \\"consultant\\", Dolby played a key role in the effort that led Ampex to unveil their prototype Quadruplex videotape recorder in April 1956 which soon entered production. Career In 1957, Dolby received his B.S. in electrical engineering from Stanford. He subsequently won a Marshall Scholarship for a Ph.D (1961) in physics from the University of Cambridge, where he was a Research Fellow at Pembroke College. After Cambridge, Dolby acted as a technical advisor to the United Nations in India until 1965, when he returned to England, where he founded Dolby Laboratories in London with a staff of four. In that same year, 1965, he officially invented the Dolby noise-reduction system, a form of audio signal processing for analog tape recorders. His first U.S. patent was not filed until 1969, four years later. The system was first used by Decca Records in the UK. The Dolby B consumer noise-reduction system works by compressing and increasing the volume of low-level high-frequency sounds during recording and correspondingly reversing the process during playback. This high-frequency round turn reduces the audible level of tape hiss. The professional Type A system operates on four different frequency bands, and the final SR system on ten. After his pioneering work with noise reduction Dolby sought to improve film sound. As the As Dolby Laboratories' corporate history explains:[citation needed] : Upon investigation, Dolby found that many of the limitations in optical sound stemmed directly from its significantly high background noise. To filter this noise, the high-frequency response of theatre playback systems was deliberately curtailed‚Ä¶ To make matters worse, to increase dialogue intelligibility over such systems, sound mixers were recording soundtracks with so much high-frequency pre-emphasis that high distortion resulted. The first film with Dolby sound was A Clockwork Orange (1971), which used Dolby noise reduction on all pre-mixes and masters, but a conventional optical sound track on release prints. Callan (1974) was the first film with a Dolby-encoded optical soundtrack. The first true LCRS (Left-Center-Right-Surround) soundtrack was encoded on the movie A Star Is Born in 1976. In fewer than ten years, 6,000 cinemas worldwide were equipped to use Dolby Stereo sound. Dolby then developed a digital surround sound compression scheme for the cinema. Dolby Stereo Digital (now simply called Dolby Digital) was first featured on the 1992 film Batman Returns. Dolby Digital is now found in the HDTV (ATSC) standard of the United States, DVD players, and many satellite-TV and cable-TV receivers. Dolby was a Fellow and past president of the Audio Engineering Society. Death Dolby died of leukemia on September 12, 2013, at his home in San Francisco at the age of 80. Dolby was survived by his wife Dagmar, two sons, Tom and David, and four grandchildren. Kevin Yeaman, president and chief executive of Dolby Laboratories, said \\"Today we lost a friend, mentor and true visionary.\\" Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, said Dolby had \\"changed the way we listen to music and movies for nearly 50 years\\" and that Dolby's \\"technologies have become an essential part of the creative process for recording artists and filmmakers, ensuring his remarkable legacy for generations to come.\\" In his will, Dolby bequeathed ¬£35 million to Pembroke College, Cambridge, the largest single donation received by the University's current fundraising campaign. In December 2017 it was announced that his family has donated a further ¬£85m from his estate to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory and a new Ray Dolby Center will be established in 2022.

Sobhuza was born on 22 July 1899 at Zombodze Royal Residence, the son of Inkhosikati Lomawa Ndwandwe and King Ngwane V. When he was only four months old, his father died suddenly while dancing incwala. Sobhuza was chosen king soon after that and his grandmother Labotsibeni and his uncle Prince Malunge led the Swazi nation until his maturity in 1921. Sobhuza led Swaziland through independence until his death in 1982. He was succeeded by Mswati III, his young son with Inkhosikati Ntfombi Tfwala, who was crowned in 1986. Early life and education Ingwenyama Sobhuza was born in Zombodze on 22 July 1899. He ascended to the throne after the death of his father, Ngwane V, as King of Swaziland on 10 December 1899, when he was only four months old. He was educated at the Swazi National School, Zombodze, and at the Lovedale Institution in the Eastern Cape, South Africa before assuming the Swazi throne as paramount chief at the age of twenty-two. His grandmother, Labotsibeni Mdluli, served as regent throughout his youth, formally transferring power to the Ngwenyama on 22 December 1921. Kingship Sobhuza's direct reign would endure more than 60 years (1921‚Äì82), during which he presided over Swaziland's independence from the United Kingdom in 1968, after which the British government recognised him as King of Swaziland (Eswatini). Early in his reign, Sobhuza sought to address the problem of land partition and deprivation instituted by the British authorities in 1907. He did so by first leading a delegation to London to meet with King George V and petition him to restore the lands to the Swazi people. He again took his case on the land issue in 1929 to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. He was defeated by the terms of the Foreign Jurisdictions Act, which effectively placed the actions of British administrations in protectorates beyond the reach of the British courts. Sobhuza's role during this colonial period was for the most part ceremonial, but he still had major influence as a traditional head of the Swazi nation. In 1953 he attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London. In the early 1960s Sobhuza played a major role in events that led to independence for his country in 1968. He opposed the post-colonial Westminster constitution proposed by the British government, in which he was assigned the role of constitutional monarch. As a consequence, acting through his advisory council, he formed the Imbokodvo National Movement, a political party, which contested and won all seats in the 1967 pre-independence elections. He became recognized by the British as King of Swaziland in 1967 when Swaziland was given direct rule. Independence was achieved on 6 September 1968. Following this, Sobhuza skilfully blended appeal to tribal custom with a capacity to manage economic and social change for his kingdom. On 12 April 1973, the king repealed the constitution and dissolved parliament, henceforth exercising power as an absolute ruler. In 1978 a new constitution was promulgated which provided for an elaborate reversion to a tribal mode of rule involving an electoral college of eighty members chosen by forty local councils known as tinkhundla, dominated by tribal elements. The Swazi economy prospered under Sobhuza's leadership. Swaziland is rich in natural resources, and much of the land and mineral wealth originally owned by non-Swazi interests was brought under indigenous control during Sobhuza's reign. Later life and death 1959 Buick LeSabre, owned by Sobhuza II. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in Lobamba. Sobhuza celebrated his Diamond Jubilee in 1981. At this time, he had successfully restored and indeed strengthened the monarch's role as the chief arbiter of decision-making in his kingdom. In the early 1980s King Sobhuza attempted to acquire control over KaNgwane, a Bantustan set up by the South African government in an attempt to reunite all Swazi people separated by the colonial boundary. He died on 21 August 1982 at Embo State house at the age of 83. Sobhuza's official incumbency of 82 years and 254 days is the longest precisely dated monarchical reign on record and the world's longest documented reign of any sovereign since antiquity. Only Pepi II Neferkare of Ancient Egypt and Taejo of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo are claimed to have reigned longer, though these claims are disputed. Family and succession Mswati III, Sobhuza II's son and eventual successor Known by the honorific \\"Bull of Swazi\\" by virtue of his numerous progeny, NY Times obituary mentions among other honorifics in passim King Sobhuza continued the tribal practice of maintaining many consorts. According to the Swaziland National Trust Commission, King Sobhuza II married 70 wives, who gave him 210 children between 1920 and 1970. About 180 children survived infancy, and 97 sons and daughters were reported living as of 2000. At his death he had more than 1,000 grandchildren. Sobhuza died in 1982, having appointed Prince Sozisa Dlamini to serve as 'Authorized Person', advising a regent. Selection of a successor was confirmed only after King Sobhuza's death, a regent being necessary if the heir remained under age at that time. By tradition, the regent would be one of the queens consort who had borne the late king a son. The first regent was Queen Dzeliwe, but after a power struggle Sozisa deposed her and she was replaced by Queen Ntfombi. During this period Andy Warhol boosted her renown, and that of Swaziland, by including her portrait along with those of Elizabeth II of the Commonwealth Realms, Beatrix of the Netherlands and Margrethe II of Denmark in his Reigning Queens series. Ntombi reigned on behalf of her young son by King Sobhuza, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini, who was designated as Crown Prince or Umntfwana. He was crowned King Mswati III in 1986. One of Sobhuza's sons-in-law was Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, King of the Zulus of South Africa, who married the Swazi king's daughter, Princess Mantfombi (born at Siteki in 1956, betrothed in 1973), at Nongoma in June 1977. Another in-law is Zenani Mandela, the daughter of former South African President Nelson Mandela, who belonged to a cadet branch of the Thembu dynasty which reigns as paramount chiefs in the Transkei. She wed Sobhuza's son, Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini who, although an older half-brother of Mswati and Mantfombi, did not inherit the Swazi throne, instead launching, with his wife, an enterprise in the United States.

The opposite of devaluation, a change in the exchange rate making the domestic currency more expensive, is called a revaluation. A monetary authority (eg., a central bank) maintains a fixed value of its currency by being ready to buy or sell foreign currency with the domestic currency at a stated rate; a devaluation is an indication that the monetary authority will buy and sell foreign currency at a lower rate. However, under a floating exchange rate system (in which exchange rates are determined by market forces acting on the foreign exchange market, and not by government or central bank policy actions), a decrease in a currency's value relative to other major currency benchmarks is instead called depreciation; likewise, an increase in the currency‚Äôs value is called appreciation. Related but distinct concepts include inflation, which is a market-determined decline in the value of the currency in terms of goods and services (related to its purchasing power). Altering the face value of a currency without reducing its exchange rate is a redenomination, not a devaluation or revaluation. Historical usage Devaluation is most often used in a situation where a currency has a defined value relative to the baseline. Historically, early currencies were typically coins struck from gold or silver by an issuing authority which certified the weight and purity of the precious metal. A government in need of money and short on precious metals might decrease the weight or purity of the coins without any announcement, or else decree that the new coins have equal value to the old, thus devaluing the currency. Later, with the issuing of paper currency as opposed to coins, governments decreed them to be redeemable for gold or silver (a gold standard). Again, a government short on gold or silver might devalue by decreeing a reduction in the currency's redemption value, reducing the value of everyone's holdings. Causes Fixed exchange rates are usually maintained by a combination of legally enforced capital controls and the central bank standing ready to purchase or sell domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency. Under fixed exchange rates, persistent capital outflows or trade deficits will involve the central bank using its foreign exchange reserves to buy domestic currency, to prop up demand for the domestic currency and thus to prop up its value. However, this activity is limited by the amount of foreign currency reserves the central bank owns; the prospect of running out of these reserves and having to abandon this process may lead a central bank to devalue its currency in order to stop the foreign currency outflows. In an open market, the perception that a devaluation is imminent may lead speculators to sell the currency in exchange for the country's foreign reserves, increasing pressure on the issuing country to make an actual devaluation. When speculators buy out all of the foreign reserves, a balance of payments crisis occurs. Economists Paul Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld present a theoretical model in which they state that the balance of payments crisis occurs when the real exchange rate (exchange rate adjusted for relative price differences between countries) is equal to the nominal exchange rate (the stated rate). In practice, the onset of crisis has typically occurred after the real exchange rate has depreciated below the nominal rate. The reason for this is that speculators do not have perfect information; they sometimes find out that a country is low on foreign reserves well after the real exchange rate has fallen. In these circumstances, the currency value will fall very far very rapidly. This is what occurred during the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico. Economic implications There are significant economic consequences for the country that devalues its currency to address its economic problems. A devaluation in the exchange rate lowers the value of the domestic currency in relation to all other countries, most significantly with its major trading partners. It can assist the domestic economy by making exports less expensive, enabling exporters to more easily compete in the foreign markets. It also makes imports more expensive, providing a disincentive for domestic consumers to purchase imported goods, leading to lower levels of imports (which can benefit domestic producers)The United States and China may be headed for a currency war, but which reduces the real income of consumers. Devaluation tends to improve a country‚Äôs balance of trade (exports minus imports) by improving the competitiveness of domestic goods in foreign markets while making foreign goods less competitive in the domestic market by becoming more expensive. The combined effect will be to reduce or eliminate the previous net outflow of foreign currency reserves from the central bank, so if the devaluation has been to a great enough extent the new exchange rate will be maintainable without foreign currency reserves being depleted any further. However, the devaluation increases the prices of imported goods in the domestic economy, thereby fueling inflation. This in turn increases the costs in the domestic economy, including demands for wage increases, all of which eventually flow into exported goods. These dilute the initial economic boost from the devaluation itself. Also, to combat inflation, the central bank would increase interest rates, hitting economic growth. A devaluation could also result in an outflow of capital and economic instability. In addition, a domestic devaluation merely shifts the economic problem to the country's major trading partners, which may take counter- measures to offset the impact on their economy of a loss of trade income arising from the initial devaluation. Devaluations in modern economies =UK economy= 1949 devaluation At the outbreak of World War II, in order to stabilise sterling, the pound was pegged to the US dollar at the rate of $4.03 with exchange controls restricting convertibility volumes. This rate was confirmed by the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944. After the war, US lend- lease funding, which had helped finance the UK‚Äôs high level of wartime expenditure, abruptly ended and further US loans were conditional upon progress towards sterling becoming fully convertible into US dollars, thereby aiding US trade. In July 1947, sterling became convertible but the resultant drain on the UK‚Äôs reserves of US dollars was such that 7 weeks later, convertibility was suspended, rationing tightened and expenditure cuts made. The exchange rate reverted to its pre-convertibility level, a devaluation being avoided by the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps, choking off consumption by increasing taxes in 1947. By 1949, in part due to a dock strike, the pressure on UK reserves supporting the fixed exchange rate mounted again at a time when Cripps was seriously ill and recuperating in Switzerland.Pimlott pp134-6Beckett p278 Prime Minister Clement Attlee delegated a decision on how to respond to three young ministers whose jobs included economic portfolios, namely Hugh Gaitskell, Harold Wilson and Douglas Jay, who collectively recommended devaluation.Pimlott pp136-7 Wilson was despatched with a letter from Attlee to tell Cripps of their decision, expecting that the Chancellor would object, which he did not.Pimlott pp138-9 On 18 September 1949, the exchange rate was reduced from $4.03 to $2.80 and a series of supporting public expenditure cuts imposed soon afterwards.Beckett p278 1967 devaluation When the Labour Government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson came to power in 1964, the new administration inherited an economy in a more parlous state than expected with the estimated balance of payments deficit for the year amounting to ¬£800 million, twice as high as Wilson had predicted during the election campaign. Wilson was opposed to devaluation, in part due to the bad memories of the 1949 devaluation and its negative impact on the Attlee government, but also due to the fact that he had repeatedly asserted that Labour was not the party of devaluation. Devaluation was avoided by a combination of tariffs and raising $3bn from foreign central banks.Pimlott pp352-4 By 1966, pressure on sterling was intensifying, due in part to the seamen's strike, and the case for devaluation being articulated in the higher echelons of government, not least by the deputy prime minister George Brown.Pimlott p414 Wilson resisted and eventually pushed through a series of deflationary measures in lieu of devaluation including a 6 month wage freeze.Campbell p281 After a brief period in which the deflationary measures relieved sterling, pressure mounted again in 1967 as a consequence of the Six-Day War, the Arab oil embargo and a dock strike.Campbell p303 After failing to secure a bail-out from the Americans or the French, a devaluation from US$2.80 to US$2.40 took effect on 18 November 1967.Pimlott pp477-82 In a broadcast to the nation the following day, Wilson said, \\"Devaluation does not mean that the value of the pound in the pocket in the hands of the ‚Ä¶ British housewife ‚Ä¶ is cut correspondingly. It does not mean that the pound in the pocket is worth 14% less to us now than it was.\\" This wording is often misquoted as \\"the pound in your pocket has not been devalued.\\"Pimlott pp483-4 =Other economies= China devalued its currency twice within two days by 1.9% and 1% in July 2015. On 5 August 2019, China devalued its currency in response to the imposition of trade tariffs by the United States against China. India devalued its currency by 35% in 1977.

Bank Nationalisation was the policy of the Andrew Fisher Labor Government. In a rare move for the time, the bank was to have both savings and general bank business. The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a Federal Government guarantee. In 1958 and 1959, there was a controversy concerning the dual function of the bank as the central bank on the one hand and a general bank on the other. As a result of this, the bank was split, giving the reserve bank function to the Reserve Bank of Australia and the general bank function to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. The Commonwealth bank was privatised in the 1990s by the Keating Labor government.

All are now defunct. In the modern United States, the term national bank has a precise meaning: a banking institution chartered and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\\"OCC\\"), an agency in the U.S. Treasury Department, pursuant to the National Bank Act. Inclusion in the bank's name of the word National,.12 CFR ¬ß 5.20(e)(1)(i). the designation National Association, or its abbreviation N.A. is a required part of the distinguishing legal title of a national bank, as in \\"Citibank, N.A.\\" or \\"CIT Bank, N.A.\\" Many state banks, by contrast, are chartered by the applicable state government agencies (usually the state's department of banking). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits at both national and state banks. The advantage of holding a National Bank Act charter is that a national bank is not subject to state usury laws intended to prevent predatory lending.Beneficial National Bank v. Anderson, . (However, see also Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, L. L. C., stating that federal banking regulations do not preempt the ability of states to enforce their own fair-lending laws.) There is currently no federal cap on rates. The federal government only requires that whatever rates, fees, or terms are set by issuers be disclosed to the consumer in accordance with the Truth in Lending Act. Notwithstanding the name, not all national banks have nationwide operations. Some national banks have operations in only one city, county, or state. National banks should also be distinguished from federal savings associations, including federal savings and loans and federal savings banks, which are financial institutions chartered by the Office of Thrift Supervision, an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department that was merged with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on 21 July 2012. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States; it is not a national bank but rather a unique system of institutions specially chartered by Congress to serve in this capacity.

Kuala Terengganu is also the capital of Kuala Terengganu District. It is also the only royal capital among the nine royal states of the country that bore its state's name. Kuala Terengganu is located about 440 kilometres northeast of Kuala Lumpur on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The city is situated at the estuary of Terengganu River, facing the South China Sea. As a district, Kuala Terengganu is the smallest in terms of area, but it (together with the Kuala Nerus District that form the city area) has the largest population in Terengganu with a population of 406,317 in 2010. City status was awarded to Kuala Terengganu with the title Bandaraya Warisan Pesisir Air (English: Waterfront Heritage City) on 1 January 2008. Besides being a major political and economic centre to the state, the city is also the main gateway to many of the state's tourist destinations. The attractions in and around the city include Kampung Cina, Pasar Besar Kedai Payang, Terengganu State Museum, and Batu Buruk Beach. Even though the city is not spared from modernity and development, Kuala Terengganu still retains strong Malay influences that are intermixed with other cultures from its long history as a port. Etymology In Malay, kuala can have the meanings of \\"river mouth\\", \\"estuary\\", or \\"confluence\\". Thus, the name Kuala Terengganu is roughly translated as \\"the confluence/estuary of Terengganu\\", referring to the broad expanse of the Terengganu River estuary which empties into the South China Sea. There are several theories regarding the name Terengganu. One such theory attributes the name's origin to terang ganu, Malay for 'bright rainbow'. Another story, which is considered to be the most popular version, is said to have been originally narrated by the ninth Sultan of Terengganu, Baginda Omar. It tells of a party of hunters from Pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a big animal fang lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong. The hunter, not knowing which animal, simply answered taring anu (Malay: 'fang of something'). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters where did they source their riches, to which they replied, from the land of taring anu, which later evolved into Terengganu. History Among the earliest references of Terengganu are in Chinese historical sources. A Chinese writer‚Äôs note during the Sui dynasty has mentioned about a state named Tan-Tan that sent tributes to China. The state was presumably located somewhere in Terengganu. Tan-Tan sent tributes to Sui dynasty and then to the Tang dynasty after Sui dynasty has collapsed. It ceased to send tributes to China after it came under the dominance of the Srivijaya during the 7th century. Chinese history books such as Lingwai Daida written by Zhou Qufei (Âë®ÂéªÈùû) in 1178 and the book Zhu fan zhi (also romanised as Chu-fanchi) written by Zhao Rugua (Ë∂ôÊ±ùÈÄÇ; also romanised as Chau Ju-Kua) in 1226 mentioned Teng-ya- nu and Teng-ya-nung respectively, as being a vassal state of San-fo-ts‚Äôi (‰∏â‰ΩõÈΩä), which is thought to be Srivijaya. After Srivijaya fell during the 13th century, Terengganu came under the influence of Majapahit. In the 15th century, Majapahit was vying with Ayutthaya Kingdom and the nascent Malacca Sultanate for the control of the Malay Peninsula. Malacca Sultanate prevailed and Terengganu then came under its influence. When the Malacca Sultanate fell in 1511 to the Portuguese, the newly established Sultanate of Johor exerted its influence on most of the former territories of the Malacca Sultanate, including Terengganu. Terengganu was briefly under the influence of the Aceh Sultanate during the early 17th century, but Johor managed to exert its influence again on Terengganu in the late 17th century. Jalan Banggol area seen from PB Square. The present Sultanate of Terengganu was established in the 1708. The first Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Zainal Abidin I established his court near Kuala Berang, then he moved his court a few more times until he settled near Bukit Keledang, Kuala Terengganu. During the early 18th century, Kuala Terengganu was still a small town. It was described as having about one thousand houses that were scattered around the town. The Chinese were already present in Kuala Terengganu at that time. Half of the population were Chinese and they were engaged in agriculture and trading. After the death of Sultan Daud in 1831, a brief civil war erupted between two claimants to the throne, namely Tengku Mansur and Tengku Omar. Tengku Omar was based at Bukit Puteri while Tengku Mansur was based at Balik Bukit. Tengku Omar was defeated by Tengku Mansur and he fled from Terengganu. Tengku Mansur became the next Sultan as Sultan Mansur II. His son, Sultan Muhammad succeeded him as the next Sultan after his death in 1837. However, in 1839, Tengku Omar returned to Terengganu with his entourage to reclaim the throne. He defeated Sultan Muhammad and forced Sultan Muhammad to flee. Tengku Omar reoccupied his fort at Bukit Puteri and was throned as the next Sultan, Sultan Omar. Maziah Palace was built to replace the old Green Palace, which was destroyed by fire in 1882. In 1862, ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel. The British requested that the ex-Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex-Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Omar of supporting Wan Ahmad. Wan Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using Kemaman as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks. The Siamese agreed to British request, but they have yet to follow through with their agreement. The Strait Settlements Governor, Sir Orfeur Cavenagh sent three ships, HMS Scout, HMS Coquette and a steamer Tonze to Kuala Terengganu, under the command of Captain Corbett, accompanied by Major MacPherson. They were sent with orders to compel the ex-Sultan of Riau-Lingga to be sent back by the British to Siam, and to call upon the Sultan to cease supporting Wan Ahmad. After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex-Sultan to the British, the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu. The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex-Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment. The ships then returned to Singapore. Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in 1882. The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings, including Green Palace (Istana Hijau), the Sultan‚Äôs palace. Maziah Palace (Istana Maziah) was later built to replace the destroyed palace. Street in Kuala Terengganu in June 1961 with a Chinese shop on the background. Kuala Terengganu continued to be Terengganu's capital when it was still a vassal state of Siam and during the early years of British colonisation of Malaya. Terengganu fell under the administration of Britain through the Bangkok Treaty of 1909 and was forced to accept a resident \\"British advisor\\". Terengganu, along with four other states were grouped under the term of Unfederated Malay States. British maintained its rule on Terengganu except during the Japanese occupation in World War II. In 1957, Malaya achieved its independence, and subsequently in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo (now the state of Sabah), Sarawak, and Singapore merge to form Malaysia. On 18 January 1979, Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was established to oversee the development of the town. The Municipal Council was upgraded to Kuala Terengganu City Council on 1 January 2008. Governance The State Secretariat building, Wisma Darul Iman, houses the Legislative Assembly of Terengganu and the Office of Mentri Besar. The city is administered by Kuala Terengganu City Council, which covers the whole area of Kuala Terengganu district. The district's location at the estuary of Terengganu River divided the district into two parts, Kuala Terengganu Utara (North Kuala Terengganu), now known as Kuala Nerus, and Kuala Terengganu Selatan (South Kuala Terengganu), which is considered to be Kuala Terengganu proper. As the capital, the city is vital to the political and economic welfare of the state. It is the centre for the state and federal government agencies administration buildings, housing the offices of many ministries' departments and governmental bodies, such as the Immigration and Customs Department, State Economic Planning Unit, Pos Malaysia Kuala Terengganu General Post Office, Terengganu State Library, and many others. As the administrative capital of Terengganu, the Legislative Assembly convenes at Wisma Darul Iman, the state secretariat building. Kuala Terengganu is also the royal capital of the state, being the site of the Sultan's many palaces, for example Istana Badariah and Istana Maziah. The Election Commission of Malaysia has divided Kuala Terengganu into four state assembly districts, which are: * N13 ‚Äì Wakaf Mempelam * N14 ‚Äì Bandar * N15 ‚Äì Ladang * N16 ‚Äì Batu Buruk PMINT Tower houses the headquarters for Kuala Terengganu City Council and Terengganu State Economic Development Corporation. Kuala Terengganu was first designated as a local government area in 1928 through the Municipal and Health Enactment 1928. At this time, the area only covered a small part of the current city border, specifically the historic core around the river mouth. The area, nevertheless, was enlarged slowly. In 1950, the town was administrated by Kuala Terengganu Town Board under section 51(1), the Local Authority Election Ordinance 1950. Like many other town boards at that time, the process of town planning was carried out according to the Town Board Enactment 1930. Until 1979, the town continued to be managed by Kuala Terengganu Town Board that governed an area of 5.4 square miles (1,398.6 hectares), with a population of around 53,300 people. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council (MPKT) was established due to the development that spilled over to the areas outside the jurisdiction of the former Town Board. MPKT was established on 18 January 1979 under the enforcement of the Local Government Act 1976. MPKT was created through the amalgamation of Kuala Terengganu Town Board and four local councils (North KT, South KT, West KT, and Central KT) with an area of 18,712 hectares covering 21 mukim or sub-districts, including some parts of Northern Kuala Terengganu. On 1 January 1985, the sub-districts of Bukit Palos and Alor Limbat were removed from the Council and placed under the administration of Marang District Council. With these changes, the area under the Council's administration was reduced to 16,806 hectares. On 16 December 1996, Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was extended to cover the entire area of Kuala Terengganu district back then, including the resort island, Redang Island. With that, the number of the sub-districts increased to 23 while the area increased dramatically to 60,528 hectares. On 1 January 2008, a declaration was made by the state government and Kuala Terengganu became the first city on the East Coast region of Peninsular Malaysia to achieve city status. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council changed its name to Kuala Terengganu City Council (MBKT) to reflect the change of its status. On 18 September 2014, the northern part of Kuala Terengganu (formerly called as Northern Kuala Terengganu) was declared as the state's newest district with the name of Kuala Nerus. This however does not mean a creation of a new local government area as Kuala Nerus is still under the jurisdiction of MBKT. As the local council for the districts of Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus, and an agency under the Terengganu state government, MBKT is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning and beautification, environmental protection and building control, social, economic and tourism development, and general maintenance and constructions of urban infrastructure. The MBKT main headquarters is located at Menara Permint in Jalan Sultan Ismail. There are two districts that are administered by MBKT. They are Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus. Kuala Nerus was formerly a part of Kuala Terengganu district, but on 18 September 2014, the Malaysian Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak declared this northern part of Kuala Terengganu district as the eighth and newest district in Terengganu state. With a population or over 200,000 and a size of 39,890 hectares, it comprises a substantial part of the former larger Kuala Terengganu district. Significant development in the areas of higher education and housing projects have occurred there in contemporary times. The main population centres of Kuala Nerus include Manir and Batu Rakit. Among major education institutions located in this district are Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, The Institute of Teacher Education Dato Razali Ismail Campus and an industrial training institute. The Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) Teaching Hospital is now under construction, thus providing this district with a new establishment. The Sultan Mahmud Airport is located within the district, as is the multipurpose Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. Although Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu are now two districts on their own, since both of them are under the administration of the same local government, this makes MBKT among the few local governments in Malaysia to manage two different districts e.g. Alor Setar, Penang Island and Seberang Perai. Geography The eastern part of Terengganu district that faces the South China Sea is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts. Small bays and coastal plains can be found. The district is divided into four major drainage basins: Terengganu River basin, Nerus River basin, Ibai River basin, and other small rivers basin. Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu are lined with swamp forests. Hills between 200‚Äì600 metres mostly dominate the western part of the district, with more than 70% of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast. The city itself has a few high points with the highest being Bukit Besar, followed by Bukit Kecil. Bukit Puteri is centrally located in the city, just near the Terengganu River estuary. The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy, palm oil trees, and rubber trees. =Climate= Sea view of Kuala Terengganu with tropical rainforest climate. As a part of Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a tropical rainforest climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round, averaging from 28 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea hsomehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas. There are two main types of monsoons in the state. The southwest monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 knots. The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres. During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear blue sky and cooling wind. Demographics =Ethnicity and religion= In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier working for the East India Company, estimated the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There were also a considerable number of Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu. According to The Malaysian Census 2010, Kuala Terengganu has a population of 406,317. The city population mainly consists of Malays with a population of 319,813. Chinese residents are the second biggest ethnic (11,617). Other residents include non-Malaysian citizens (4,326), other Bumiputras (643), Indians (867) and others (287). The same census shows that the population of Kuala Terengganu by religion is 96.9% Muslim, 2.5% Buddhist, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Christian, and 0.2% follower of other religions, Sikhs or non-religious. All Malays are Muslim. The Chinese of Kuala Terengganu are made up of Hokkien and they practised either Buddhism, Taoism or Christianity. A small number of Hindus and Sikhs also exist. =Languages= Terengganu Malay is the most widely spoken and main lingua franca in the city and is spoken by the Malays in Kuala Terengganu. Some Malays also speak Kelantanese, especially those who came from Besut, northern Setiu and Kelantan. The Chinese mostly use Hokkien with some using Teochew and Mandarin. Most Indians in Kuala Terengganu speak Tamil and few Punjabi as well. Standard Malay and English are widely spoken and understood. Economy Kuala Terengganu was a major fishing port and one of the important trading ports in Malaya. The chief export commodities were coffee, gambier, gold, ivory, pepper and tin. They were mainly traded for rice, tobacco, cotton goods and opium.Other sources:  The economic sector in Kuala Terengganu is mostly made up of small-scale manufacturing industries such as the traditional textile making, local food industries, arts and craft factories, and agriculture, with most of them centred around residential areas or villages. There are two main industrial estates catered to bigger industries, one in Chendering and the other one in Gong Badak. Factories such as those that produce bricks or timber products are located further away from the main city areas. As the principal gateway for tourists to the state, tourism remains as one of economic source for Kuala Terengganu. Public facilities and infrastructure =Transportation= Public transport Transport facilities that are available in Kuala Terengganu include the taxicab and Kuala Terengganu Bus Terminal where the local bus services and interstate coaches to all major cities and towns in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore operate. There is a limited service tourist bus that plies back and forth to tourist areas such as the Nor Arfa batik outlet south of the city, and the jetty for ferries to the island resorts at Redang and Perhentian islands. Kuala Terengganu has its own special bus service known as Bas Bandar or Town Bus, operated by the state-owned firm Cas Ligas Sdn. Bhd. The buses have the characteristics of a traditional old Malay house through the unique roof design to reflect the state cultural identity. The buses cover three lines in and out of the city. A token fare of MYR1 should be paid for each ride. There are also trishaw services although this service is dying fast and is not as extensive as the ones in the states of Malacca and Penang. In Kuala Terengganu, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by trishaws (beca in Malay). Trishaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanisation has increased demand for more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling trishaw numbers. Today, trishaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu. The city's only taxi rank stands nearby to the city's bus terminal. As with the rest of Terengganu, Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) does not serve Kuala Terengganu. Nevertheless, this is about to change as the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, has commenced and is slated to connect Kuala Terengganu with Tumpat and Kota Bharu in Kelantan, Kuantan in Pahang, and Gombak in Kuala Lumpur by 2024. Kuala Terengganu is also the first city in the East Coast to have a public bicycle-sharing system. This service is provided the Singaporean operator, oBike. Like all other cities with oBike, the system has no docking stations. Instead the bikes have a built-in Bluetooth lock and can therefore be left anywhere at the end of a journey. Users use a smartphone app to locate and hire bikes. A view of Kuala Terengganu Drawbridge from Seberang Takir Land The Sultan Mahmud Bridge, a three-kilometre bridge over the Terengganu River, provides the main road link between the two banks of the river (connecting Kuala Nerus to Kuala Terengganu) and Duyong Island. Two other bridges that straddles the river to connect both sides of the city are Manir Bridge and Pulau Sekati Bridge. A new fourth bridge, Kuala Terengganu Drawbridge, was completed in mid-2019 and fully opened for traffic in August. The bascule bridge, which is the first of its kind in Southeast Asia, spans 638 metres and has four 15-storey towers with skybridges. It connects the city centre with Seberang Takir via Muara Utara, a reclaimed land slated for future developments.Kuala Terengganu Drawbridge to be Opened for Test Run from June-2-17  Malaysia  The StarTerengganu drawbridge to reopen tomorrow  Malaysia  New Straits TimesTerengganu MB: Iconic drawbridge to be opened tomorrow  Malaysia  Malay Mail The city and suburbs are relatively easy to negotiate by car.

They contributed the track \\"Jesus Saves\\" to the Mushroom Records soundtrack to the Australian horror feature film, Cut, in 2000. In June 2000, Jerk had a line-up change with Devoy now on lead vocals and Lowder still on drums, joined by guitarist Charles Cilia and former Candy Harlots bass guitarist Leeno Dee. In 2001, Jerk released a self-titled six-track extended play with three accompanying music videos, directed by Lowder. These led to an appearance at the Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra late in the year. In April 2002 Jerk signed to Sony Records. In 2003, Jerk with the line-up of Cilia, Dee, Devoy and Lowder, issued their full-length album When Pure Is Defiled, which was co-produced by Sean Beavan and Lamar Lowder.

He was born in Duluth, Minnesota, to Canadian parents and moved to Canada in 1918 with his family. Raised in Alberta, he graduated from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1939 and worked as a chiropractor and then as a teacher before serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. Early political career Thompson supported the Social Credit Party of Alberta from its creation. His age prevented him from running as a candidate in the 1935 provincial election. Instead he became youth leader of the party. Ethiopia In 1944, Thompson was sent to Ethiopia to serve as the founding commander of the Imperial Ethiopian Air Force and head up nation's air force academy. He became a confidante of Emperor Haile Selassie I and, after the war, became deputy minister of education and helped rebuild the nation's public school system. Return to Canada and Social Credit Thompson returned to Canada in 1958 and resumed his activities with Social Credit. He soon became president of the national Social Credit Party of Canada, doing much to rebuild the party after it was shut out of Parliament in the massive Progressive Conservative (PC) landslide of 1958. Alberta Premier Ernest Manning saw Thompson as the ideal person to succeed Solon Low as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada and backed him in a hotly contested leadership vote against R√©al Caouette, the movement's leader in Quebec, which was won by Thompson. Years later, Caouette claimed that he would have won, but Manning told him to tell the Quebec delegates to vote for Thompson because the West would never accept a Francophone Catholic as party leader.Dufresne, Bernard, ‚ÄúQuebec‚Äôs Socreds vote to Disown Thompson‚Äù, Globe and Mail, 2 September 1963, p.1 Under Thompson's leadership, the Socreds returned to the Commons in the 1962 federal election. Thompson himself was elected from Red Deer, Alberta. However, he was one of only four Socreds elected from English Canada, while 26 came from Quebec led by Caouette. Under the circumstances, Thompson was all but forced to name Caouette as the party's deputy leader. Thompson was re-elected in the 1963 and 1965 elections. The 1962, 1963, and 1965 elections produced minority parliaments in which no one party had a majority of seats (the PCs won the largest plurality in the first election, the Liberals in the other two). This meant that the government had to rely on smaller parties such as Social Credit to pass legislation and remain in power. Division in the party The Social Credit Party was sharply divided after 1962. Most Socred MPs came from Quebec and regarded Caouette as their leader. The number of Socreds from English Canada was declining, as was made sharply clear at the 1962 election. Additionally, the party's English wing, including Thompson, had largely abandoned social credit theory in favour of fiscal conservatism. In contrast, Caouette and other Quebec Socreds still held fast to the theory. Despite the massive linguistic imbalance in his caucus, Thompson refused to cede the leadership of the party to Caouette. This caused the party to split, and most of the party's Quebec MPs followed Caouette into his new Ralliement cr√©ditiste in 1963. Move to the Progressive Conservatives Thompson was frustrated by the lack of support the national party enjoyed from the provincial Social Credit parties in Alberta and British Columbia, where they formed the governments and ran powerful political machines. Additionally, Manning was becoming concerned with the leftward trajectory of both the federal Liberals and Progressive Conservatives. He encouraged Thompson to try to bring about a merger of the federal Social Credit and Progressive Conservative parties. Negotiations failed but, with the backing of both Manning and Robert Stanfield, Thompson decided to cross the floor to the Tories in hopes of influencing that party. He resigned as leader of Social Credit in March 1967, citing the lack of support for the federal Social Credit Party from its provincial wings.\\"Robert Thompson resigns as leader of Socred Party\\", Toronto Star, March 9, 1967 He then sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for his old seat. Despite vehement opposition from the local Tory riding association, he won the nomination and was reelected in 1968. British Columbia Prior to the 1972 election, Thompson moved to British Columbia to teach and tried to win a seat from that province, Surrey‚ÄîWhite Rock, but was defeated in the attempt. He retired from politics and taught political science at Trinity Western University in British Columbia through the 1970s. At various times he also served as chairman of the university's board of governors and vice president of development at the school. In the late 1980s, Thompson was on the executive board of the World Anti-Communist League. In his last years, Thompson was instrumental in bringing the former Emperor Haile Sellassie's children out of Ethiopia and to safety in the west following the Ethiopian Revolution. His intervention probably saved them from a near-certain death. Quote The Americans are our best friends, whether we like it or not. Book *Canadians, It's Time You Knew!, Robert N.

For example, a primary obligation of a nobleman could include generosity towards those around him. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the term suggests \\"noble ancestry constrains to honourable behaviour; privilege entails responsibility.\\" The Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise defines it thus: > # Whoever claims to be noble must conduct himself nobly. # (Figuratively) > One must act in a fashion that conforms to one's position and privileges > with which one has been born, bestowed and/or has earned.  Meaning and variants  \\"Noblesse oblige\\" is generally used to imply that with wealth, power, and prestige come responsibilities. In ethical discussion, it is sometimes used to summarize a moral economy wherein privilege must be balanced by duty towards those who lack such privilege or who cannot perform such duty. Finally, it has been used recently to refer to public responsibilities of the rich, famous and powerful, notably to provide good examples of behaviour or to exceed minimal standards of decency. It has also been used to describe a person taking the blame for something in order to solve an issue or save someone else. History and examples Figurative armories of \\"de Mortsauf\\" in Le lys dans la Vall√©e by Honor√© de Balzac An early instance of this concept in literature may be found in Homer's Iliad. In Book XII, the hero Sarpedon delivers a famous speech in which he urges his comrade Glaucus to fight with him in the front ranks of battle. In Pope's translation, Sarpedon exhorts Glaucus thus: > 'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace The first in valour, as the first > in place; That when with wondering eyes our confidential bands Behold our > deeds transcending our commands, Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign > state, Whom those that envy dare not imitate! In Le Lys dans la Vall√©e, written in 1835 and published in 1836, Honor√© de Balzac recommends certain standards of behaviour to a young man, concluding: \\"Everything I have just told you can be summarized by an old word: noblesse oblige!\\"(English translation: Lily of the Valley) His advice had included comments like \\"others will respect you for detesting people who have done detestable things.\\" The phrase is carved into Bertram Goodhue's Los Angeles Public Library on a sculpture by Lee Lawrie as part of Hartley Burr Alexander's iconographic scheme for the building. Lawrie, Lee, Lee Lawrie: Sculpture, J.H. Jansen, Cleveland, Ohio, 1936 Masters, Margaret Dale, Hartley Burr Alexander: Writer-in-Stone, Jacob North Printing Company, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1992, pp. 54-55 Critique Noblesse oblige, while seeming to impose on the nobility a duty to behave nobly, conveniently provides the aristocracy with an apparent justification for their privilege. This argument is \\"as nobles, we have rights, but we have duties also; and such duties thereby validate our rights\\". By contrast, jurists such as Dias and Hohfeld have pointed out that rights and duties are jural corelatives, which means that if someone has a right, someone else owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in Murphy v Brentwood District Council (1991) to disapprove Lord Denning MR's judgment in Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council (1972).

It became the top-selling digital synthesizer of its time. Development Whereas previous synthesizers had shipped with sounds chosen for different markets, Korg chairman Tsutomu Kato and his son Seiki decided that their synthesizers should use the same sounds internationally. Korg assembled an international team to develop the sounds for the M1. To create a deep blown bottle sound, the team played a pan flute over a large sake bottle.  Features  The M1 features a 61-note velocity- and aftertouch-sensitive keyboard, 16-note polyphony, a joystick for pitch-bend and modulation control, an eight-track MIDI sequencer, separate LFOs for vibrato and filter modulation, and ADSR envelopes. Data can be stored on RAM and PCM cards. The M1 has a ROM with four megabytes of 16-bit PCM tones, including, according to Sound on Sound, \\"exotic instruments that previously hadn't been heard in the mainstream\\". The sounds include sampled attack transients, loops, sustained waveforms without attack transients, and percussive samples. The timbres include piano, strings, acoustic guitar, woodwinds, sitar, kalimba, wind chimes, and drums. The M1 also features effects including reverb, delay, chorus, tremolo, EQ, distortion, and Leslie simulation, an innovative inclusion at the time. According to Sound on Sound, none of the M1's features were unique at the time of release, but were implemented and combined in a new way.  Legacy  The Korg M1 is the bestselling synthesizer in history. It was released in 1988 and manufactured until 1995, selling an estimated 250,000 units. Sound on Sound wrote that it \\"can rightly be called the most popular synth of all time\\". The M1 piano and organ presets were widely used in 1990s house music, beginning with Madonna's 1990 single \\"Vogue\\". Its slap bass sound was used to create the theme tune for the sitcom Seinfeld.

Edward Adolphus Seymour (later St. Maur), 12th Duke of Somerset, etc., (20 December 180428 November 1885), styled Lord Seymour until 1855, was a British Whig aristocrat and politician, who served in various cabinet positions in the mid-19th century, including that of First Lord of the Admiralty. Background and education Somerset was the eldest son of Edward St. Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset, and Lady Charlotte, daughter of Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton. He was baptized on 16 February 1805 at St. George's, Hanover Square, London.The Complete Peerage; vol. XII, pt. I, p. 86. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. Political career Somerset sat as Member of Parliament as Lord Seymour for Okehampton between 1830 and 1831 and for Totnes between 1834 and 1855. He served under Lord Melbourne as a Lord of the Treasury between 1835 and 1839, as Joint Secretary to the Board of Control between 1839 and 1841 and as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between June and August 1841 and was a member of Lord John Russell's first administration as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests between 1849 and 1851, when the office was abolished. He served on the Royal Commission on the British Museum (1847‚Äì49).The Life of Sir Anthony Panizzi, Volume 1, by Louis Alexander Fagan, p257 In August 1851 he was appointed to the newly created office of First Commissioner of Works by Russell. In October of the same year he entered the cabinet and was sworn of the Privy Council. He remained First Commissioner of Works until the government fell in February 1852. Somerset succeeded his father in the dukedom in 1855 and entered the House of Lords. He did not serve in Lord Palmerston's first administration, but when Palmerston became Prime Minister for a second time in 1859, Somerset was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the cabinet. He held this post until 1866, the last year under the premiership of Russell. He refused to join William Ewart Gladstone's first ministry in 1868, but gave independent support to the chief measures of the government. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1862 and in 1863 he was created Earl St. Maur, of Berry Pomeroy in the County of Devon. \\"St. Maur\\" was supposed to have been the original form of the family name and \\"Seymour\\" a later corruption. From some time in the early 19th century until 1923, \\"St. Maur\\" was used for the family name, but since 1923 the dukes have again used the familiar \\"Seymour\\". Somerset was also the author of Christian Theology and Modern Scepticism (1872), and Monarchy and Democracy (1880). Between 1861 and 1885 he served as Lord Lieutenant of Devon.leighrayment.com Peerage: Slim to Sramfordham Family Somerset married in Grosvenor Square, London, on 10 June 1830, Jane Georgiana Sheridan, who was the ‚ÄúQueen of Beauty‚Äù at the Eglinton Tournament of 1839.

It was the first military aeroplane to be mass-produced in Germany. The Taube was very popular prior to the First World War, and it was also used by the air forces of Italy and Austria-Hungary. Even the Royal Naval Air Service operated at least one Taube in 1912. On 1 November 1911, Giulio Gavotti, an Italian aviator, dropped the world's first aerial bomb from his Taube monoplane over the Ain Zara oasis in Libya. Once the war began, it quickly proved inadequate as a warplane and was soon replaced by other designs. Design and development The Etrich-Wels glider prototype, with Igo Etrich in the cockpit The Taube was designed in 1909 by Igo Etrich of Austria-Hungary, and first flew in 1910. It was licensed for serial production by Lohner-Werke in Austria and by Edmund Rumpler in Germany, now called the Etrich-Rumpler-Taube. Rumpler soon changed the name to Rumpler-Taube, and stopped paying royalties to Etrich, who subsequently abandoned his patent. Despite its name (Taube means \\"dove\\"), the Taube's unique wing form was not modeled after a dove, but was copied from the seeds of Alsomitra macrocarpa, which may glide long distances from their parent tree. Similar wing shapes were also used by Karl Jatho and Frederick Handley Page. Etrich had tried to build a flying wing aircraft based on the Zanonia wing shape, but the more conventional Taube type, with tail surfaces, was much more successful. Etrich adopted the format of crosswind-capable main landing gear that Louis Bl√©riot had used on his Bl√©riot XI cross-channel monoplane for better ground handling. The wing has three spars and was braced by a cable-braced steel tube truss (called a \\"bridge\\", or Br√ºcke in German) under each wing: at the outer end the uprights of this structure were lengthened to rise above the upper wing surfaces, to form kingposts to carry bracing and warping wires for the enlarged wingtips. A small landing wheel was sometimes mounted on the lower end of this kingpost, to protect it for landings and to help guard against ground loops.The Etrich Monoplane Flight, 11 November 1911, p.276 Later Taube- type aircraft from other manufacturers replaced the Bleriot type main gear with a simpler V-strut main gear design, and also omitted the underwing \\"bridge\\" structure to reduce drag. Like many contemporary aircraft, especially monoplanes, the Taube used wing warping rather than ailerons for lateral (roll) control, and also warped the rear half of the stabilizer to function as the elevator. Only the vertical, twinned triangular rudder surfaces were usually hinged. Operational history Design drawing of Taube from 1911 In civilian use, the Taube was used by pilots to win the Munich-Berlin Kathreiner prize. On 8 December 1911, Gino Linnekogel and Suvelick Johannisthal achieved a two-man endurance record for flying a Taube 4 hours and 35 minutes over Germany. The design provided for very stable flight, which made it extremely suitable for observation. The translucent wings made it difficult for ground observers to detect a Taube at an altitude above 400 meters. The first hostile engagement was by an Italian Taube in 1911 in Libya, its pilot using pistols and dropping grenades during the Battle of Ain Zara. The Taube was also used for bombing in the Balkans in 1912‚Äì13, and in late 1914 when German bomblets and propaganda leaflets were dropped over Paris. Taube spotter planes detected the advancing Imperial Russian Army in East Prussia during the World War I Battle of Tannenberg. Front page of the New York Times Mid-Week Pictorial, 1 January 1917, captioned \\"A German Fighting Monoplane Flying Very Near the Ground Photographed from Directly Underneath.\\" World War I While initially there were two Taube aircraft assigned to Imperial German units stationed at Qingdao, China, only one was available at the start of the war due to an accident. The Rumpler Taube piloted by Lieutenant Gunther Pl√ºschow had to face the attacking Japanese, who had with them a total of eight aircraft. On 2 October 1914, Pl√ºschow's Taube attacked the Japanese warships blockading Tsingtao with two small bombs, but failed to score any hits. On 7 November 1914, shortly before the fall of Qingdao, Pl√ºschow was ordered to fly top secret documents to Shanghai, but was forced to make an emergency landing at Lianyungang in Jiangsu, where he was interned by a local Chinese force. Pl√ºschow was rescued by local Chinese civilians under the direction of an American missionary, and successfully reached his destination at Shanghai with his top secret documents, after giving the engine to one of the Chinese civilians who rescued him. Poor rudder and lateral control made the Taube difficult and slow to turn. The aeroplane proved to be a very easy target for the faster and more agile Allied Scouts of the early part of World War I, and just six months into the war, the Taube had been removed from front line service to be used to train new pilots. Many future German aces would learn to fly in a Rumpler Taube.

JSTOR specifically an understanding of the Bible and Catholic tradition in light of modern mainstream conceptions of archeology, philology, the historical-critical method and new philosophical and political developments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries‚Äîand implicitly all that this might entail. The term came to prominence in Pope Pius X's 1907 encyclical Pascendi Dominici gregis, which synthesized and condemned modernism as embracing every heresy.Pascendi dominici gregis English translation: https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/on-the-doctrine-of-the- modernists-3496 Writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia in 1911, the Jesuit Arthur Vermeersch gave a definition of modernism in the perspective of the Roman Catholic heresiology of his time: \\"In general we may say that modernism aims at that radical transformation of human thought in relation to God, man, the world, and life, here and hereafter, which was prepared by Humanism and eighteenth-century philosophy, and solemnly promulgated at the French Revolution.\\" The modernist movement was influenced and accompagnied by Protestant theologians and clergy like Paul Sabatier and Heinrich Julius Holtzmann. On the other hand, \\"modernist\\" theologians were critical of Protestant theology and engaged in apologetics of the Roman Catholic Church against a Protestant understanding of Christianity, as in the famous attack of Alfred Loisy in L'√âvangile et l'√âglise (1902) on Adolf von Harnack's Das Wesen des Christentums (1900). The modernist movement has a parallel in the Church of England where the journal The Modern Churchman was founded in 1911. The controversy on modernism was prominent in French and British intellectual circles and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, but, in one way or another, it concerned most of Europe and North America. Pope Pius X saw modernism as a universal threat and he provoked a global reaction. The term modernism is generally used by critics of rather than adherents to positions associated with it. Dimensions of the controversy on Modernism Although the so-called modernists did not form a uniform movement, they responded to a common constellation of religious problems around 1900, which transcended Catholicism: First of all the problem of historicism which seemed to render all historical forms of faith and tradition relative. Secondly, through the reception of modern philosophers like Immanuel Kant, Maurice Blondel, and Henri Bergson the neo-scholastic philosophical and theological framework set up by Pope Leo XIII became fragile. The assertion that objective truth is received subjectively is indeed fundamental for the entire controversy. This focus on the religious subject engendered a renewed interest in mysticism, sanctity and religious experience in general. The aversion against a religious \\"extrinsicism\\" also led to a new hermeneutics for doctrinal definitions which were seen as secondary formulations of an antecedent (immanent) religious experience (George Tyrrell; cfr. also the Christian personalism of Lucien Laberthonni√®re). Romolo Murri (1870‚Äì1944) The controversy was not restricted to the field of philosophy and theology. On the level of politics, Christian Democrats like the layman Marc Sangnier in France and the priest Romolo Murri in Italy, but also the left wing of the Centre Party and the Christian Unions in Germany, opted for a political agenda which was no more completely controlled by the hierarchy. Pope Pius X reacted by excommunicating Murri in 1909, by dissolving Sangnier's Sillon movement in 1910, and by issuing the encyclical Singulari quadam in 1912 which clearly favoured the German Catholic workers' associations over against the Christian Unions. Furthermore, antimodernists like Albert Maria Weiss OP and the Swiss Caspar Decurtins, which were both favoured by Pius X, would even find \\"literary modernism\\" on the field of the Catholic belles-lettres which did not meet their standards of orthodoxy. In the eyes of the antimodernist reaction, the \\"modernists\\" were a uniform and secret sect within the Church. In a historical perspective, one can discern networks of personal contacts between \\"modernists\\", especially around Friedrich von H√ºgel and Paul Sabatier. On the other hand, there was a great bandwidth of opinions within the \\"movement\\", from people ending up in rationalism (e.g. Marcel H√©bert, Albert Houtin, Salvatore Minocchi, Joseph Turmel) to a mild religious reformism, even including neo-scholastic theologians like Romolo Murri. This perception of a broad movement from left to right was already shaped by the protagonists themselves. Terminology: From Liberal Catholicism to Modernism \\"Liberal Catholicism\\" designated originally a current of thought within the Catholic Church that was influential in the 19th century, especially in France, and aimed at reconciling the Church with liberal democracy. It was largely identified with French political theorists such as Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais, Henri Lacordaire, and Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert.Bury, J.P.T., \\"Religion and Relations of Churches and States\\", The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 10, CUP Archive, 1960 In the second half of the 19th century the term was also applied to theologians and intellectuals like Ignaz von D√∂llinger, St. George Jackson Mivart, John Zahm, and Franz Xaver Kraus who wanted to reconcile the Catholic faith with the standards of modern science and society in general. In 1881, the Belgian economist Charles P√©rin, a conservative Roman Catholic layman, published a volume titled Le modernisme dans l‚Äô√©glise d‚Äôapr√®s les lettres in√©dites de La Mennais. P√©rin was the first author to use the term \\"modernism\\" in a Catholic context - before him the Dutch Calvinist Abraham Kuyper had attacked the rationalist German theology of the Protestant T√ºbingen School as \\"modernism\\" (Het modernisme een fata morgana op christelijk gebied, 1871). For P√©rin \\"modernism\\" was a label for the attempts of Liberal Catholics to reconcile Catholicism with the ideals of the French Revolution and of democracy in general. He saw the danger that humanitarian tendencies in secular society would be received within the Catholic Church. This \\"social\\" definition of Catholic Modernism would be taken up again later by Integralism. P√©rin's usage of the term \\"modernism\\" was accepted by the Roman journal of the Jesuits, the semi-official Civilt√† Cattolica, which added the aspect of an exaggerated trust in modern science to this concept. When five exegetical books of the French theologian Alfred Loisy were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in December 1903, the official papal paper L'Osservatore Romano distinguished between \\"modernity\\" and \\"modernism\\", which entailed heresy in religion, revolution in politics, and error in philosophy. The term \\"modernism\\" now began to replace older labels like \\"Liberal Catholicism\\" or (especially in Germany) \\"Reform Catholicism\\". George Tyrrell (1861-1909) The connection between \\"Liberal Catholicism\\" and \\"Modernism\\" has been subject to controversial discussion. In 1979, Thomas Michael Loome stressed the continuity between the two and talked of a \\"vertical dimension\\" of the modernist controversy. This \\"invention of tradition\\" was criticized - amongst others - by Nicholas Lash. It is clear, however, that already the Joint Pastoral of the English episcopate against \\"Liberal Catholicism\\" (December 1900) did not only react on St. George Jackson Mivart, but also on the writings of the later \\"modernist\\" George Tyrrell. The letter had been prepared in Rome and was inspired by Rafael Merry del Val who became Tyrrell's chief opponent under Pius X. Furthermore, \\"modernists\\" like Tyrrell compared their own difficulties after the publication of Pascendi with the difficulties of \\"liberal catholics\\" like Ignaz von D√∂llinger after Vatican I. In December 1907, Tyrrell wrote to a German correspondent: \\"Is it not time to reconsider the pseudo-council of 1870 and to ask whether the Alt-Katholiks were not, after all, in the right? Ex fructibus eorum etc. [You will know them by their fruits. Matthew 7:16] may surely be used as a criterion of Ultramontanism. Individuals, like myself, can afford to stand aloof as D√∂llinger did. But can multitudes live without sacraments and external communion? And yet now no educated man or woman will be able to remain in communion with Pius X.\\" Tyrrell was also inspired by the posthumous publication of Lord Acton's History of Freedom and Other Essays in 1907. History of the Modernist controversy Although the so-called \\"Modernist Crisis\\" is usually dated between 1893 (Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical Providentissimus Deus) and 1914 (death of Pope Pius X), the controversy has had a pre-history and also a post- history. =Pre-history: controversies under Pope Pius IX= Ernest Renan With notable exceptions like Richard Simon or the Bollandists, Catholic studies in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries tended to avoid the use of critical methodology because of its rationalist tendencies. Frequent political revolutions, bitter opposition of \\"liberalism\\" to the church, and the expulsion of religious orders from France and Germany, made the church understandably suspicious of the new intellectual currents.Donahue, John R., \\"Biblical Scholarship 50 years After Divino Afflante Spiritu\\", America, September 18, 1993 In 1863, Ernest Renan published Vie de J√©sus (Life of Jesus). Renan had trained for the priesthood before choosing a secular career as a philologist and historian. His book described Jesus as \\"un homme incomparable\\", a man, no doubt extraordinary, but only a man. The book was very popular, but cost him his chair of Hebrew at the College de France. Among Renan's most controversial ideas was that \\"a miracle does not count as a historical event; people believing in a miracle does. Renan‚Äôs Jesus is a man of simple piety and almost unimaginable charisma whose main historical significance was his legion of followers.Theiss, Will. \\"The Pale Galilean: Ernest Renan, Jesus, and Modern History\\", Marginalia, Los Angeles Review of Books, March 16, 2018 In the same year 1863, the church historian Ignaz von D√∂llinger invited about a 100 German theologians to meet at Munich (M√ºnchener Gelehrtenversammlung, 1863) and to discuss the state of Catholic theology. In his address, \\"On the Past and Future of Catholic Theology\\", D√∂llinger advocated for greater academic freedom of theology within the church. He formulated also a critique of neo-scholastic theology and championed the historical method in theology.Howard, Thomas Albert. \\"A Question of Conscience\\", Commonweal, September 29, 2014 Also in the year 1863, D√∂llinger's friend Charles de Montalembert gave his famous discourse at the Catholic Congress in Mechelen, favouring the freedom of religion and conscience. On 8 December 1864 Pope Pius IX issued the encyclical Quanta cura, decrying what he considered significant errors afflicting the modern age. It condemned certain propositions such as: \\"the people‚Äôs will, manifested by what is called public opinion..., constitutes a supreme law, free from all divine and human control\\"; on civil law alone depend all rights of parents over their children, and especially that of providing for education; and that religious orders have no legitimate reason for being permitted.Pope Pius IX. Quanta Cura, ¬ß4, December 8, 1864 Some of these condemnations were aimed at anticlerical governments in various European countries, which were in the process of secularizing education and taking over Catholic schools, as well as suppressing religious orders and confiscating their property.Hales, E.E.Y. The Catholic Church in the Modern World, (Doubleday, 1958) Attached to the encyclical was a \\"Syllabus of Errors\\" which had been condemned in previous papal documents, requiring recourse to the original statements to be understood. The Syllabus reacted not only on modern atheism, materialism, and agnosticism, but also on Liberal Catholicism and the new critical study of the Bible. It was also a direct reaction on D√∂llinger's speech in Munich and Montalembert's discourse at Mechelen. Among the propositions condemned in the Syllabus were: * \\"7. The prophecies and miracles set forth and recorded in the Sacred Scriptures are the fiction of poets, and the mysteries of the Christian faith the result of philosophical investigations. In the books of the Old and the New Testament there are contained mythical inventions, and Jesus Christ is Himself a myth.\\" * \\"13. The method and principles by which the old scholastic doctors cultivated theology are no longer suitable to the demands of our times and to the progress of the sciences.\\" ‚Äî Letter to the Archbishop of Munich \\"Tuas libenter,\\" Dec. 21, 1863. * \\"15. Every man is free to embrace and profess the Religion he shall believe true, guided by the light of reason.\\" ‚Äî Apostolic Letter \\"Multiplices inter\\", 10th June 1851. Allocution \\"Maxima quidem\\", 9th June 1862. The First Vatican Council was held from December 1869 to October 1870. The council provoked a degree of controversy even before it met. In anticipation that the subject of papal infallibility would be discussed, many bishops, especially in France and Germany, expressed the opinion that the time was \\"inopportune\\". Ignaz von D√∂llinger led a movement in Germany hostile to the definition of infallibility. In D√∂llinger's view, there was no foundation for this definition in Catholic tradition. After the definition, D√∂llinger was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Munich. Montalembert died before the end of the Council. The dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith, Dei Filius, tried to steer a middle way between rationalism and fideism. It presented a concept of revelation which highlighted the aspect of divine instruction by revelation. The dogmatic Constitution Pastor Aeternus addressed the primacy of the pope and rejected the idea that decrees issued by the pope for the guidance of the Church are not valid unless confirmed by the secular power. It also declared the infallibility of the pope when speaking \\"ex cathedra\\" on matters of faith and morals. Other matters were deferred when the Piedmontese infantry entered Rome and the council was prorogued.Kirch, Joseph. \\"Vatican Council.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 15 May 2019 =The beginning of the Modernist controversy under Pope Leo XIII= Pope Leo XIII Pope Leo XIII wanted to advance what he understood as the true Christian science in every way: He worked for a revival of Thomism as Christian philosophy, he encouraged the study of history and archaeology, and in 1881 he opened up the Vatican Archives for researchers. In 1887 he encouraged the study of the natural sciences, and in 1891 opened a new Vatican Observatory.Murphy, Richard T. \\"The Teachings of the Encyclical ‚ÄòProvidentissimus Deus‚Äô\\", The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, vol. 5, no. 2, 1943, pp. 125‚Äì140. JSTOR Leo's response to the rationalist trend to undermine the authority of sacred scripture, was for the Church to have its own trained experts. In 1893, with Providentissimus Deus, Pope Leo gave the first formal authorization for the use of critical methods in biblical scholarship.Prior, Joseph G., The Historical Critical Method in Catholic Exegesis, Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 1999 \\"Hence it is most proper that Professors of Sacred Scripture and theologians should master those tongues in which the sacred Books were originally written, and have a knowledge of natural science. He recommended that the student of scripture be first given a sound grounding in the interpretations of the Fathers such as Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilary, Ambrose, Leo the Great, Gregory the Great, Augustine and Jerome, and understand what they interpreted literally, and what allegorically; and note what they lay down as belonging to faith and what is opinion. Although Providentissimus Deus tried to encourage Catholic biblical studies, it created also problems. In the encyclical, Leo XIII excluded the possibility of restricting the inspiration and inerrancy of the bible to matters of faith and morals. Thus, he interfered in the lively discussion about biblical inspiration in France, where Maurice d'Hulst, the founder of the Institut Catholique de Paris, had opted for a more open solution in his article on La question biblique. Not only exegetes of this \\"√©cole large\\" were now in trouble, but also the prominent French theologian Alfred Loisy who worked for a thoroughly historical understanding of the Bible, in order to open up spaces for theological reform. The Roman Congregation of the Index began to prepare a censuring of Loisy's main works, but until the death of Leo XIII in 1903 no decision was taken, as there was also considerable resistance within the Roman Curia against a premature judgment on matters of biblical interpretation. On the whole, the official Catholic attitude to the study of Sacred Scripture at the turn of the 20th century was one of cautious advance, and at the same time of a growing appreciation of what had promise for the future.\\"Regarding history of Biblical interpretation\\", Catholic Sentinel, Archdiocese of Portland., December 13, 2011 In 1902, Pope Leo XIII instituted the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which was to adapt Roman Catholic Biblical studies to modern scholarship and to protect Scripture against attacks.\\"Biblical Commission.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 =Marie-Joseph Lagrange= In 1890 the √âcole Biblique, the first Catholic school specifically dedicated to the critical study of the bible, was established in Jerusalem by Dominican Marie- Joseph Lagrange. In 1892 Pope Leo XIII gave his official approval. While many of Lagrange's contemporaries criticized the new scientific and critical approach to the Bible, he made use of it. Lagrange founded the Revue Biblique, and his first articles drew sharp criticism, but Pope Leo was not inclined to discourage new ideas.Becker O.P., John Vianney. \\"Pere LaGrange\\", Dominicana As long as Pope Leo lived, Lagrange's work quietly progressed, but after Leo's death, an ultra-conservative reaction set in. The Historical-Critical Method was considered suspect by the Vatican. P√®re Lagrange, like other scholars involved in the 19th-century renaissance of biblical studies, was suspected of being a Modernist.\\"Our Founder\\", √âcole biblique et arch√©ologique fran√ßaise de Jerusalem In 1912 Lagrange was given an order for the Revue Biblique to cease publication and to return to France. The √âcole itself was closed for a year, and then Lagrange was sent back to Jerusalem to continue his work. = Duchesne and Loisy = Louis Duchesne, 1899 Louis Duchesne was a French priest, philologist, teacher, and amateur archaeologist. Trained at the √âcole pratique des Hautes √âtudes in Paris, he applied modern methods to Church history, drawing together archaeology and topography to supplement literature and setting ecclesiastical events within the contexts of social history. Duchesne held the chair of ecclesiastical history at the Institut Catholique de Paris, and was frequently in contact with like-minded historians among the Bollandists, with their long history of critical editions of hagiographies.De Smedt, Charles. \\"The Bollandists.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. March 15, 2013 Duchesne gained fame as a demythologizing critical historian of the popular, pious lives of saints produced by Second Empire publishers.Strenski, Ivan. Theology and the First Theory of Sacrifice, BRILL, 2003, p. 220 However, his Histoire ancienne de l'√âglise, 1906‚Äë11 (translated as Early History of the Christian Church) was considered too modernist by the Church at the time, and was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1912. Alfred Loisy Alfred Loisy was a French Roman Catholic priest, professor and theologian generally credited as the \\"father of Catholic Modernism\\". He had studied at the Institut Catholique under Duchesne and attended the course on Hebrew by Ernest Renan at the Coll√®ge de France. Harvey Hill says that the development of Loisy's theories have to be seen also in the context of France's Church-State conflict, which contributed to Loisy's crisis of faith in the 1880s. In November 1893, Loisy published the last lecture of his course, in which he summed up his position on biblical criticism in five propositions: the Pentateuch was not the work of Moses, the first five chapters of Genesis were not literal history, the New Testament and the Old Testament did not possess equal historical value, there was a development in scriptural doctrine, and Biblical writings were subject to the same limitations as those by other authors of the ancient world.Boynton, Richard Wilson. \\"The Catholic Career of Alfred Loisy\\", The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 11, No. 1 (1918), pp. 36-73, Cambridge University Press When his attempts at theological reform had failed, Loisy came to regard the Christian religion more as a system of humanistic ethics than as divine revelation.Schultenover, David G.\\"The Politics of Modernism: Alfred Loisy and the Scientific Study of Religion (review)\\", The Catholic Historical Review, vol. 89 no. 1, 2003, pp. 114-115 He was excommunicated in 1908.Encyclopedia Americana (Volume 17: 1969), pgs 707-708. Article by Francis J. Hemelt of The Catholic University of America = The climax of the controversy under Pope Pius X = Pope Pius X Pope Pius X, who succeeded Leo XIII in August 1903, engaged almost immediately in the ongoing controversy. Reacting on pressure from the Parisian Archbishop Cardinal Richard, he transferred the censuring of Loisy from the Congregation of the Index to the Supreme Congregation of the Holy Office. Already in December 1903, Loisy's main exegetical works were censured. At the same time the Holy Office began to prepare a syllabus of errors contained in the works of Loisy. Due to ongoing internal resistance, especially from the Master of the Sacred Palace, the papal theologian Alberto Lepidi OP, this Syllabus was published only in July 1907 as the decree Lamentabili sane exitu, which condemned sixty-five propositions from the field of biblical interpretation and the history of dogma. Lamentabili did not mention the term \\"modernism\\", and it seems that Pius X and his close collaborators like Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val and Cardinal Jos√© de Calasanz Vives y Tut√≥ were not satisfied with the document. Therefore, in the summer of 1907, another document was prepared in a small circle around the pope, and already in September 1907 Pius X promulgated the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis, which formulated a synthesis of modernism and popularized the term itself. The encyclical condemned modernism as embracing every heresy.. Pascendi described the \\"modernist\\" in seven \\"roles\\": as purely immanentist philosopher, as believer who relies only on his own religious experience, as theologian who understands dogma symbolically, as historian and biblical scholar who dissolves divine revelation by means of the historical-critical method into purely immanent processes of development, as apologete who justifies the christian truth only from immanence, and as reformer who wants to change the Church in a radical way. Agnosticism, immanentism, evolutionism and reformism are the keywords used by the pope to describe the philosophical and theological system of modernism. The modernist is an enemy of scholastic philosophy and theology and resists the teachings of the magisterium. His moral qualities are curiosity, arrogance, ignorance, and falsehood. Modernists deceive the simple believers by not presenting their entire system, but only parts of it. Therefore the encyclical wants to reveal the secret system of modernism. Pascendi contained also disciplinary measures for the promotion of scholastic philosophy and theology in the seminaries, for the removal of suspect professors and candidates for the priesthood, for a more rigid censuring of publications and for the creation of an antimodernist control group in every diocese. All bishops and superiors of religious orders had to report regularly on the execution of these measures. Pius frequently condemned the movement, and was deeply concerned that its adherents could go on believing themselves strict Catholics while understanding dogma in a markedly untraditional sense (a consequence of the notion of evolution of dogma). Therefore, in 1910, he introduced an anti-modernist oath to be taken by all Catholic priests, while he shut down \\"the only notable American Catholic magazine\\", the Ecclesiastical Review \\"precisely when it was needed to challenge the increasing influence of John Dewey‚Äôs pragmatism.\\" To ensure enforcement of these decisions, Monsignor Umberto Benigni organized, through his personal contacts with theologians and laymen in various European countries, a secret network of informants who would report to him those thought to be teaching condemned doctrine or engaging in political activities (like Christian Democratic Parties, Christian Unions) which were also deemed to be \\"modernist\\" because they were not controlled by the Catholic hierarchy. This group was called the Sodalitium Pianum, i.e. Fellowship of Pius (V), the code name was La Sapini√®re. Its frequently overzealous and clandestine methods often hindered rather than helped the Church in its combat with modernism. Benigni also published the journal La Corrispondenza Romana/Correspondance de Rome which initiated press campaigns against practical and social modernism throughout Europe. Benigni fell out with Cardinal Secretary of State Rafael Merry del Val in 1911. The Sodalitium was eventually dissolved in 1921. Recent research has stressed the antisemitic character of Benigni's antimodernism. = In America = Archbishop John Ireland (1838‚àí1918) With his slogan \\"Church and Age unite!\\", Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, became the hero of reformers in France (F√©lix Klein), Italy and Germany (Herman Schell) in the 1890s. The modernist controversy in the United States was thus initially dominated by the conflict on \\"Americanism\\", which after Pascendi was also presented as a \\"forerunner\\" of modernism in Roman Catholic heresiology.. The antimodernist measures after Pascendi were especially felt in the Archdiocese of New York: The New York Review was a journal produced by Saint Joseph's Seminary (Dunwoodie). It printed papers by leading Catholic Biblical experts who were part of the newly emerging schools of Biblical criticism, which raised eyebrows in Rome. Around 1908, the Review was discontinued, ostensibly for financial reasons, although there is strong evidence that it was suppressed for modernist tendencies.DeVito, Michael J., \\"The New York Review (1905-1908)\\", (New York: United States Catholic Historical Society, 1977), Chapter 6 = Post-history in the twentieth century = After the pontificate of Pius X, \\"there was a gradual abatement of attacks against modernists, beginning in 1914 when Pope Benedict XV urged Catholics to cease condemning fellow believers.\\" Nevertheless theological antimodernism continued to influence the climate within the Church. The Holy Office, until 1930 under the guidance of Merry del Val, continued to censure modernist theologians. In the 1930s, Loisy's opera omnia were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books. During World War I, French Catholic propaganda claimed that the German Catholics were infected by modernism. Already in 1913 it had been claimed by the French academic Edmond Vermeil that the Catholic T√ºbingen School in the mid-19th century, with its interest for the \\"organic development\\" of the Church in history, was a \\"forerunner\\" of \\"modernism\\" ‚Äì a claim which has been contested ever since. In the period between World War I and the Second Vatican Council Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange O.P. was a \\"torchbearer of orthodox Thomism\\" against modernism. Garrigou-Lagrange, who was a professor of philosophy and theology at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, is commonly held to have influenced the decision in 1942 to place the privately circulated book Une √©cole de th√©ologie: le Saulchoir (√âtiolles- sur-Seine 1937) by Marie-Dominique Chenu O.P.On Chenu's role in intra-thomist controversies see on the Vatican's \\"Index of Forbidden Books\\" as the culmination of a polemic within the Dominican Order between the Angelicum supporters of a speculative scholasticism and the French revival Thomists who were more attentive to historical hermeneutics, such as Yves Congar O.P. Yves Congar during Vatican II At the beginning of the 1930s, Congar read the M√©moires of Loisy and realised that modernism had addressed problems in theology which were still not resolved by scholastic theology. Chenu and Congar, two protagonists of the \\"Nouvelle th√©ologie\\", began to prepare a dossier on this topic. In 1946, Congar wrote to Chenu that scholastic theology had already begun to \\"liquidate\\" itself on a daily basis and that the Jesuits were among the fiercest \\"liquidators\\". Congar's Chr√©tiens d√©sunis was also suspected of modernism because its methodology derived more from religious experience than from syllogistic analysis. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s is seen as a vindication of much that the modernists maintained \\"in an environment of suspicion and unrelenting personal attack\\". The aggiornamento of the council incorporated most of the advances in biblical and church studies that had been put forth by Catholic scholars over the previous century. According to the Jesuit theologian Christoph Theobald, Vatican II has tried to resolve the following problems addressed by Alfred Loisy: 1. Inspiration of Holy Scripture: Loisy's view that divine inspiration cannot be restricted to certain areas of scripture, but that scripture was at the same time entirely \\"historical\\" has found an echo in the dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum where the principle that divine revelation has happened \\"for the sake of our salvation\\" and has been testified by Holy Scripture is combined with the task of scrutinizing Scripture in a historical-exegetical way. 2. In his inaugural address to the Second Vatican Council, Pope John XXIII distinguished between the depositum fidei and its historical forms of expression, thus echoing Loisy's distinction between \\"truth\\" and \\"doctrine.\\" 3. The transcendental theology of Karl Rahner has synthesized the opposition of immanentism and extrinsicism which Loisy had problematized in many of his essays. Accordingly, Dei verbum has supplemented the instruction-centered model of revelation in the First Vatican Council by the concept of divine self-communication in history. 4. The concept of doctrinal development has been received in some dialectical formulations in Dei Verbum. Reference to modernism continues to survive among traditionalists within the Church.

He served briefly as First Lord of the Admiralty between March and December 1905. Background and education Cawdor was the eldest son of John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor, and his wife Sarah Mary, daughter of General the Hon. Henry Cavendish. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He was brought up on the family estates in south Wales and his coming of age in 1868 was a major event in the town of Llandeilo. In 1874 he was appointed to be Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Inverness. MP for Carmarthenshire Cawdor was Conservative Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire from 1874 to 1885. In 1885 the constituency was divided in two and Emlyn decided to contest the new West Carmarthenshire constituency, although most of his family property lay in the eastern part of the county. His chances there appeared to be negligible given the growing industrial population which had been a key factor in the triumph of the Liberal candidate, Edward Sartoris at the 1868 General Election. Emlyn was opposed by the other sitting member, the Liberal W.R.H. Powell, himself a former Conservative supporter, who had first declared his support for the Liberals at the 1874 election. Powell now proclaimed that he had a duty to the Liberal cause to oppose Emlyn. It was reported that the Conservatives were confident of their chances in West Carmarthenshire, on the grounds that it was largely an agricultural division. However, the electorate had more than doubled in the county, and the 1885 electorate in the Western Division alone exceeded that of the combined county seat in 1880. Powell's victory ended Emlyn's career in Carmarthenshire politics. Later political career He succeeded in the earldom in 1898 and served briefly under Arthur Balfour as First Lord of the Admiralty. Lord Cawdor took a leading part in the Conservative opposition to Lloyd George's budget of 1909 and in drafting resolutions for the reform of the House of Lords in 1910. He was also involved in Pembrokeshire local affairs, and as Chairman of the Great Western Railway from 1895 to 1905 greatly improved the service. In 1904 he was elected unopposed as a member of Pembrokeshire County Council to represent the Castlemartin ward. Lord Cawdor was an officer in the Carmarthen Artillery Militia, where he was lieutenant- colonel in command from 24 September 1892 until he retired on 5 November 1902. During these years he was promoted to colonel and appointed an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII. Family Lord Cawdor married Edith Georgiana Turnor, daughter of Christopher Turnor, on 16 September 1868. They had ten children. He died in February 1911, aged 63, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son Hugh. Lady Cawdor died in 1926. References * *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

He served in various capacities in the Liberal governments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Biography Tweedmouth was the son of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and Isabella, daughter of Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet. Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, was his sister. He is descended from Joseph Marjoribanks, a wine and fish merchant in Edinburgh who died in 1635 and is thought to have been the grandson of Thomas Marjoribanks of Ratho,Marjoribanks, Roger. \\"Marjoribanks of Lees\\", The Marjoribanks Journal Number 3, page 14, June 1995.

He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, but expelled in 1870 following a prank involving that led to the damage of college sculptures. =Political career= Tweedmouth Tweedmouth was returned to Parliament for Berwickshire in 1880, a seat he held until 1894. The seat had been held earlier in the century by his great-uncle, Sir John Marjoribanks, 1st Baronet and cousin, Charles Albany Marjoribanks. He served under William Ewart Gladstone as Comptroller of the Household in between February and July 1886 and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. When the Liberals returned to power under Gladstone in 1892, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (chief whip). He succeeded his father in the barony in March 1894, only a few days before Gladstone resigned and Lord Rosebery became Prime Minister. Rosebery appointed Tweedmouth Lord Privy Seal, with a seat in the cabinet, and in May 1894 he also became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He retained these posts until the government fell in 1895. After ten years in opposition, the Liberals again came to power in December 1905 under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who appointed Tweedmouth First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the cabinet. In early 1908 he was criticised for corresponding with German emperor William II on the British naval programme. The matter was referred to the House of Commons. Chancellor of the Exchequer H. H. Asquith eventually stated that the correspondence was \\"a purely personal and private communication, conceived in an entirely friendly spirit\\" and no action was taken. However, when Asquith succeeded Campbell-Bannerman as Prime Minister in April 1908 Tweedmouth was removed as head of the Admiralty and became Lord President of the Council. He suffered a nervous breakdown in June 1908, a condition which was said to partly explain his indiscretion in communicating with the German Emperor on naval matters. Although his health later recovered, he resigned in October 1908. He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1908. An advocate of worker's rights and social legislation, Tweedmouth was supportive of the Liberal Party's alliance with the Labour Party in the lead-up to the 1906 General Election, believing that the Liberals could not win without it, and regarded as \\"humbug\\" the view that such an alliance meant class legislation. He died on 15 September 1909. Family Lord Tweedmouth married Lady Fanny Octavia Louise (1853‚Äì1904), daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and aunt of Sir Winston Churchill, in 1873. She reportedly died from cancer in August 1904, aged 51 \\"at Lord Tweedmouth's Glen Affric shooting lodge\\". They had a son and heir; Dudley, 3rd Baron Tweedmouth (1874‚Äì1935). Lord Tweedmouth's parliamentary career saw him reported as being the Laird of Guisachan and Glenaffric who was, on occasions, \\"in a fighting mood\\". Following Lady Tweedmouth's death, Lord Tweedmouth sold the Lairdship of Glen Affric, the property including the Guisachan Estate and deer park that his family had owned since the 1850s. He was reported as being a \\"generous laird\\", who, like his father, \\"did much for the people\\" of his estate; the \\"ties which united the people of Glen Affric with the Laird and his lady were close\\". Lord Tweedmouth survived his wife by five years and died in September 1909, aged 60. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Dudley. The Rocking Chair Ranche From 1883 until 1896, he was an owner of and investor in Rocking Chair Ranche located in Collingsworth County, Texas, along with his father, The 1st Baron Tweedmouth, and his brother-in-law, The 7th Earl of Aberdeen.

Joey Manley was the website's publisher and original editor. The site featured a roster of approximately 30 professional webcomic artists. Shaenon Garrity, one of the site's original artists, took over as the publication's editor in 2006. Other Modern Tales artists included Gene Luen Yang, James Kochalka, Dorothy Gambrell, Harvey Pekar and Will Eisner. In the first four years of Modern Tales' run, its most recent webcomic pages and strips were free, and the site's archives were available by subscription. The website's archives eventually became free to read as well, as online advertisement rates improved. Modern Tales did solid business and Manley spun off a number of similar subscription services, including Serializer.net, Girlamatic, and Kochalka's American Elf, which together became known as the \\"Modern Tales family\\". Concept Working in San Francisco for Streaming Media in the early 2000s, Joey Manley became interested in the possibilities for artists on the web. To introduce himself to the webcomic community, he started a podcast Digital Comics Talk and a review website Talk About Comics. In 2001, Manley conceptualized a for-profit subscription-based webcomic collective where readers can pay a monthly or annual fee to get access to a library of webcomic archives. He hoped the subscription model would allow artists to work together to increase each other's visibility and profits. Manley began to recruit artists, many of whom he had met through his podcast. Shaenon Garrity described the webcomics showcased on Modern Tales as \\"ambitious, offbeat, and often visually experimental.\\" The publication was named in the spirit of old pulp magazines, such as Amazing Stories and Weird Tales. The most recent update of each webcomic on Modern Tales was freely available, and readers could pay US$2.95 per month or $29.95 per year to get access to the website's archive. History Manley in 2009 Modern Tales launched on March 2, 2002, with a roster of major emerging artists and cartoonists. Its launch line-up included Lark Pien, Jason Shiga, Jesse Hamm, Gene Luen Yang, James Kochalka, and Dorothy Gambrell. Established heavy hitters like Harvey Pekar and Will Eisner contributed later, but Modern Tales was generally a showcase for new artists. The website grew rapidly in its first week: while Manley predicted his website would accrue around 150 subscribers in its first year, Modern Tales actually earned over 700 subscribers in its first week. Manley attributed this to high cost of bandwidth and the relatively low number of high-quality webcomics available at the time. As time went on and the number of high-quality free webcomics increased, the subscriber count of Modern Tales went stagnant. By August 2003, Modern Tales' back catalogue featured over 4,000 webcomic pages. The website ran a section, curated by Gary Chaloner, featuring 20 Australian cartoonists to aid them in connecting with a global audience. In 2004, Manley published the Modern Tales' \\"2003 Yearbook\\", titled Tallscreen Edition, through BookSurge. This is a 130-page full-color printed book featuring works from all of Joey Manley's webcomic subscription services. In January 2006, Manley launched a secondary, advertisement-driven version of Modern Tales, edited by blogger and critic Eric Burns. Manley decided to establish this free version of Modern Tales in response to changes in economic circumstances that drive website models. In an interview with The Comics Reporter, Manley stated that \\"the Modern Tales brand isn't really sustainable in the current environment,\\" and that he saw a need to append free webcomics to his subscription services. Narbonic-creator Shaenon Garrity took over as editor of Modern Tales in August 2006, and worked on reviving its long-form webcomic section and implementing the Project Wonderful advertisement system. As the subscription model became less and less popular, Manley eventually made the website entirely free. =Spin-off sites= Manley spun off several other websites based on Modern Tales' subscription model, including Serializer.net, Girlamatic, AdventureStrips.com and Graphic Smash. Each of these sites had a different editorial focus from that of Modern Tales, such as alternative comics and action comics. Manley also published two single-webcomic subscription sites under the Modern Tales umbrella, Kochalka's American Elf and Lea Hernandez' Rumble Girls. The entire group of subscription sites Manley published were known as the \\"Modern Tales family.\\" Manley launched the free hosting provider Webcomics Nation in 2005 as he took note of the changing Web economy. Whereas Modern Tales and its family was constructed in the style of traditional editorial magazines, Webcomics Nation was set up more as a service-bureau business. =Closure= As Modern Tales declined in readership, it was shut down in 2012. The remaining family of subscription services closed down in April 2013, and Manley died in November 2013 of pneumonia. Success and impact Manley's stated goal when he launched Modern Tales was for subscription revenue alone to provide a living wage for artists within five years, and the services did do solid business. Due to Modern Tales' revenue=sharing model, the most viewed webcomics like Garrity's Narbonic generated the most income and, in the best years, Garrity could have lived solely off her Modern Tales earnings had she lived somewhere less expensive than the San Francisco Bay Area. Six months after the site's launch, Donna Barr was \\"impressed\\" that she was regularly making US$100 per month from Modern Tales. Other Modern Tales artists made comparatively little; in 2005, Hernandez described her income from Modern Tales as \\"gas money\\", and Dave Roman said he typically made less than US$100 per year on the website. Before his comic was canceled, cartoonist Jason Shiga was able to make US$70 per strip when he was published in a weekly Bay Area newspaper, but he only made US$4 per strip on Modern Tales in 2003.Ho, Patricia Jiayi (July 8, 2003). \\"Online comic artists don't have to play panel games\\". Alameda Times-Star (Alameda, CA) Some artists on Manley's other sites, such as Kochalka with his American Elf, were able to make more money than the most profitable artists on the original Modern Tales site. Manley said in July 2003 that Modern Tales was attracting between 10,000 and 15,000 individual visitors daily, and that 3,500 people had signed up for a subscription. In an interview with Alameda Times- Star, Manley said \\"We're not Disney, obviously, but we have proven that people will pay for Web comics.\\" Throughout 2005 and 2006, Modern Tales had around 2,100 subscribers, which was the most of Manley's four subscription services. The entire Modern Tales family grossed around US$100,000 per year, though this had to be split among nearly 100 cartoonists as well as the Web hosting company. Modern Tales was cited by Comic Book Resources as one of the first workable and profitable subscription models for webcomics. The viability of Modern Tales inspired Marvel Comics and DC Comics to develop their own digital comic websites. The Sunday Times criticized the website in 2006 for its unintuitive homepage and slow page loading.

From 1913 to 1917, McCarran was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Nevada, and he served as chief justice from 1917 to 1919. In 1932 McCarran defeated Republican incumbent Tasker Oddie for Nevada's Class 3 Senate seat to become the state's first U.S. Senator born in Nevada; he was reelected three times, and served from 1933 until his death. In his Senate career, McCarran served as chairman of the District of Columbia, Judiciary, and Joint Foreign Economic Cooperation Committees. He died in Hawthorne, Nevada and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Reno. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas was later named in his honor. McCarran is remembered as one of the few Democrats to reject the New Deal. In addition, he was a proponent of the aviation industry; he was a sponsor of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, and was a proponent of establishing the United States Air Force as a separate entity from the Army. McCarran was also an ardent anti-Communist, to the point of supporting fascists including Francisco Franco as a way to prevent its spread, and sponsored the McCarran Act, otherwise known as the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950. Early life and education McCarran was born in Reno, Nevada, the child of Irish immigrants Margaret Shay and Patrick McCarran. He was educated in Reno and in 1897, he graduated as valedictorian of his class at Reno High School. McCarran's mother was a devout Catholic, and he inherited his mother's faith. He attended Nevada State University (now University of Nevada, Reno), but withdrew to work on the family sheep ranch when his father suffered an injury. Instead of returning to college, McCarran studied law with attorney William Woodburn. Encouraged by Anne Henrietta Martin, who had been his political science professor, McCarran ran for the Nevada Assembly in 1902 as a Free silver Democrat. He was elected and served one term, 1903 to 1905. In 1904 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Nevada State Senate. He was admitted to the bar in 1905, and in 1906 he was elected district attorney of Nye County. He served one term, 1907 to 1909, after which he moved to Reno to continue practicing law. Some sources incorrectly state that McCarran received a bachelor's degree in 1901 and a master's degree in 1915. In fact, he did not receive a bachelor's degree at all, and the master of arts he received from Nevada State University in 1915 was an honorary degree. He also received an honorary LL.D. from Georgetown University in 1943, and an honorary LL.D. from the University of Nevada in 1945. Judicial career In 1912, McCarran was elected to the Supreme Court of Nevada, succeeding John G. Sweeney. He served as an Associate Justice from January 1913 to January 1917. In January 1917, he succeeded Frank Herbert Norcross as Chief Justice. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1918, and served until January 1919, when he was succeeded on the court by Edward Augustus Ducker, and as Chief Justice by Benjamin Wilson Coleman. Both during his time on the court and afterwards, McCarran continued to play a central role in Nevada's state government, as well as its legal and criminal justice systems. From 1913 to 1918, he served on the state Board of Library Commissioners. In addition, he served as chairman of the Nevada State University Board of Visitors. From 1913 to 1919 he served on the state Board of Pardons. He was a member of the Board of Parole Commissioners from 1913 to 1918, and he served on the Board of Bar Examiners from 1919 until 1932. McCarran was president of the Nevada Bar Association from 1920 to 1921, and was a vice president of the American Bar Association from 1922 to 1923. United States Senate =Election history= McCarran's ambition to serve as a U.S. Senator was well known in Nevada, and often the subject of jokes in the press. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1916, and lost to incumbent Key Pittman. McCarran endorsed Pittman in the general election, and Pittman was reelected. In 1926, McCarran was again a candidate for the U.S. Senate. He lost the Democratic nomination to Raymond T. Baker, who was defeated by Republican incumbent Tasker Oddie in the general election. In 1932, McCarran was the Democratic nominee, and he defeated Oddie in the general election. He was reelected in 1938, 1944, and 1950, and served from March 4, 1933 until his death. =Leadership positions= During his career as a Senator, McCarran served as chairman of the: Committee on the District of Columbia (77th and 78th Congresses); Committee on the Judiciary (78th, 79th, 81st, and 82nd Congresses); and Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation (81st United States Congress) (co-chairman). =Opposition to Roosevelt administration= During his first term as senator, McCarran was engaged in a major struggle for the control of patronage appointments relating to federal projects in Nevada with his fellow Democratic Senator, Key Pittman. As Nevada was a poor state badly hit by the Great Depression, there was considerable competition to be awarded a patronage appointment, and those who had control of patronage were in a strong position politically. As Pittman was the senior senator, and McCarran only a freshman senator, President Franklin D. Roosevelt tended to side with Pittman in the struggle for the control of patronage, thus earning McCarran's enmity. Much of McCarran's opposition to the New Deal stemmed from his anger and spite that Pittman was able to make more patronage appointments relating to New Deal projects in Nevada than he was. Pittman's increasingly serious drinking problems rendered him somewhat ineffective in his last years, and McCarran was able to gradually take over the Democratic Party in Nevada, becoming the dominant force within the Nevada Democrats by 1938. Despite being a Democrat, beginning in the late 1930s McCarran came into increasing opposition with Roosevelt, believing that Roosevelt's \\"second\\" New Deal policies following his 1936 reelection were too liberal. Further complicating the picture was that by 1939, Roosevelt was convinced that the Danzig crisis would probably lead to a war in Europe, and that it was in the best interests of the United States to ensure that Britain and France defeated Germany, which would require relaxing the various Neutrality Acts passed by Congress earlier in the 1930s. As Pittman was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, his co-operation was essential. Thus for foreign policy reasons, Roosevelt had to back Pittman despite the way he was losing control of the Nevada Democrats to McCarran. From 1939 to 1941, the isolationist McCarran opposed Roosevelt's foreign policy of aiding the Allies, accusing the president of trying to involve America in a war that not its business. In particular, the Catholic conservative McCarran was outraged by the decision of the Roosevelt administration to offer military and economic aid to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, arguing that it was immoral to assist the \\"godless communists\\".Ybarra, Michael J. Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt, Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 271 In a speech on the Senate floor, McCarran declared that \\"I despise Mr. Hitler and all that he stands for, and equally I despise Mr. Stalin and all that he stands for\\", before going on to argue that though he did not like Nazi Germany that he regarded the Third Reich as the lesser evil compared to the Soviet Union, and felt it was profoundly wrong for the United States to offer aid to the nation he felt was the greater evil. McCarran was greatly influenced by a statement from the Catholic Church in the spring of 1937 declaring that \\"Communism is intrinsically wrong, and no one who would save Christian civilization may collaborate with it in any undertaking\\". McCarran supported the war effort after the United States entered the conflict following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. McCarran's positions on several key committees, most notably Appropriations and Judiciary, gave him significant influence that he used to obtain federal funding for Nevada, a fact which contributed substantially to his home state popularity. In 1944, McCarran was challenged by Vail M. Pittman in the Democratic primary, leading to an especially hard-fought campaign that was finally won by McCarran. At the time, Pittman explained his loss as due to McCarran's ability to bring federal money to fund infrastructure projects in Nevada, at the time a relatively backward state, saying: > \\"McCarran had a pet project in nearly every town in the state. Housing > projects, sewage systems, airfields, power projects, school houses and > heaven knows what...People remember the little personal favors and the > things that help financially, but they forgot all the things done that are > more remote, but more vital\\". McCarran's biographer, Jerome Edwards, endorsed this theory, arguing that the narrow margin of McCarran's victory over Pittman in the Democratic primary suggests that a substantial number of registered Democrats in Nevada were dissatisfied with him, but his ability to have the federal government built infrastructure projects that Nevada could not afford on its own explains his enduring appeal in his state. Outside of Nevada, McCarran had the reputation of a narrow-minded and parochial senator who put the interests of Nevada ahead of the wider national interests; the same reasons that made him unpopular outside of Nevada made him popular there as he had the reputation of a dogged, relentless fighter for Nevada's interests. McCarran's repeatedly attempted via filibusters to force the federal government to stockpile silver, a measure that would have benefited Nevada where silver mining was a major industry, but was widely denounced outside of Nevada as a plan for wasteful spending designed only to benefit his state. After Pearl Harbor, McCarran in his speeches to the Senate made much of the fact that most of American industry was concentrated in the Northeast and the Midwest, and argued that the federal government had the duty to ensure that war production was shifted to less industrialized states like Nevada. McCarran also was well known for his efforts to help constituents with any problems that they might have with the federal government, often going to extraordinary lengths. For instance, when a teenager from Nevada stolen 150 volumes from the Library of Congress and mutilated hundreds of more books, his parents asked McCarran to intervene to ensure that their son was not prosecuted. McCarran duly called up the Washington D.C. District Attorney Edward Curran and the FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover, saying he not want the teenager prosecuted as that would cost him the votes of the parents of the bibliophobic vandal-thief, and owing to the senator's advocacy, the teenager was not prosecuted despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt and his theft and destruction of books costing thousands of dollars. in 1942, when a Reno couple learned that their son had been captured by the Japanese at Wake Island, they appealed to McCarran for help. McCarran brought considerable pressure to bear on the State Department to set up a prisoner exchange, saying that it essential for him to keep the two votes of the parents of the POW, through the State Department insisted that the United States was not in the business of prisoner exchanges, which would involve making deals with the Axis powers that the American people would find unsavory. This had a greater effect that the handful of votes involved, as it vastly enhanced his reputation as a man who could ‚Äòget things done‚Äô, which translated into substantial support at the polls. In the 1940s-50s, 40% of Senate bills had to first be approved by the Senate Judiciary committee, giving McCarran immense power as he could easily \\"kill\\" these bills in his committeeOshinksy, David A Conspiracy So Immense Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 207. Other committee chairmen had the same powers over bills related to their fields, but the number of bills that had to passed by the Judiciary Committee made McCarran far more influential than the other senate committee chairmen. Over time, McCarran used his position as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to engage in much deal-making that allowed him to collect a significant number of political \\"debts\\", making him of the most powerful Senators. McCarran's conservative politics, which pitted him against first Roosevelt and then Truman, frequently led to the question being asked why he continue to sit as a Democrat instead of defecting over to the Republicans. In 1950, when McCarran asked that question by a reporter, he responded: \\"I can do more good by staying in the Democratic Party and watching the lunatic fringe- the Roosevelt crowd\\".Oshinksy, David A Conspiracy So Immense Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 208. McCarran was against the plans of the Roosevelt-Truman administrations for federal health insurance and increased education spending; favored restricting the power of unions; was opposed to increased immigration, saying he did not want \\"undesirables from abroad\\" coming to America; and was against the United Nations, which he called \\"a haven for spies and Communists\\". As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he appointed his friend, Senator James Eastland, a well known white supremacist and segregationist, as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Civil Rights (although he did not share the Senator‚Äôs views). Such was McCarran's power that in July 1952, the liberal Washington Post newspaper (which was not friendly to the conservative McCarran) declared in an article: \\"It sums the character of this congress to state an unquestionable fact: that its most important member was Patrick A. McCarran\\". =Aviation advocate= McCarran sponsored numerous laws concerning the early commercial aviation industry, including the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 and the Federal Airport Act of 1945. He was an early advocate of the Air Force as a military component separate from the Army, and began sponsoring the necessary legislation in 1933.The First 100 Persons Who Shaped Southern Nevada, 1st100.com; accessed December 12, 2016. =Other initiatives= In 1945, McCarran co-sponsored the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempted the insurance industry from most federal regulations, including antitrust rules. Instead, this act required states to regulate insurance, including mandatory licensing requirements. McCarran also co-sponsored the 1946 Administrative Procedures Act, which required federal agencies to keep the public informed of their organizational structure, procedures and rules, allowed for public participation in the rule making process, and established uniform standards for the conduct of formal rule making. =Anti-communist= Harris & Ewing portrait of McCarran in 1947 McCarran established himself as one of the Senate's most ardent anti- Communists. An admirer of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, he was nicknamed the \\"Senator from Madrid\\" by columnist Drew Pearson over his efforts to increase foreign aid to Spain. McCarran voted for President Harry S. Truman's 1947 plan to provide aid to Greece and Turkey as part of an effort to prevent them from becoming communist, but in 1949 McCarran broke with Truman after he rejected McCarran's request for increased economic aid to Spain and military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist Chinese government. In 1949, McCarran visited Spain, where he was treated like a visiting head of state, and he made it clear his admiration for El Caudillo (\\"the leader\\") as Franco had styled himself.Ybarra, Michael J. Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt, Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 pages 473-474 McCarran's praise for Franco, who had leaned in a pro-Axis neutrality for much of World War II, greatly annoyed Truman who told the press that: \\"I don't like Franco and I never will\\".Ybarra, Michael J. Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt, Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 474 During his visit to Spain, McCarran met with Franco to discuss U.S aid for his regime, which infuriated Truman who noted that the constitution gave the executive the right to conduct foreign policy, which led him to angrily declare that the senator from Nevada did not have the right to conduct his own foreign policy.Ybarra, Michael J. Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt, Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 475 After World War II, McCarran continued his anti-Communist efforts. He was a supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, whose \\"loss of China\\" to communists in 1949 he blamed on Soviet influence in the State Department. In 1952, McCarran attended a dinner hosted by the Kuomintang Chinese Ambassador to Washington together with Republican Senators Joseph McCarthy and William Knowland; the event began with the toast \\"Back to the mainland!\\" McCarthy sought McCarran's favor after he started his \\"crusade against Communism\\", giving \\"hot tips\\". McCarran told his friends that \\"Joe is a bit irresponsible\\" and a \\"publicity hound\\", but praised him for his attacks on the Truman administration. In 1951, in an interview with the U.S. News, McCarran replied to the questions asked that he believed that the American Communist Party had been engaging in the \\"infiltration\\" of the media, churches, university faculties, unions and \\"nationality groups\\". In August‚ÄìSeptember 1950, McCarran was the chief sponsor of the McCarran Internal Security Act. This legislation required the Communist Party USA and affiliated organizations to register with the Attorney General and established the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate possible communist subversion and communist front organizations. The act also gave the government World-War-II-type powers to imprison without trial of people \\"likely\\" to be spies, saboteurs, and \\"subversives\\" if the president declared a national emergency (through those imprisoned could appeal to a review board).Fried, Richard Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 page 117. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the act, charging that it violated civil liberties and put the government in \\"the business of thought control\\". In the \\"hot summer\\" of 1950, with the Korean War raging abroad and the Second Red Scare at home, few in Congress wanted to be appear to voters to be \\"soft\\" on communism, and this popular pressure made Congress override Truman's veto, with the House voting 248 to 48 and the Senate 57 to 10. This forced Truman to reluctantly enforce a law he felt violated the Bill of Rights. After passage of the act, the Federal Bureau of Prisons built six holding camps (either old POW camps from World War II or abandoned military bases) to hold \\"subversives\\" if a national emergency was declared.Fried, Richard Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 page 118. No such emergency was ever declared and the camps were never used before being shut down in 1957 as a cost-cutting measure. Due to numerous hearings, delays and appeals, the act was never enforced, and its major provisions were declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in 1965 and 1967. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, McCarran created and was the first chairman of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee that investigated the Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman administrations to expose supposed communist spies and sympathizers. In 1951, subcommittee investigators seized the records of the Institute of Pacific Relations in an effort to identify alleged communist infiltration of the organization, which had been formed in 1925 to foster cooperation between Pacific Rim nations. McCarran made much of these records when questioning a Sinologist, Owen Lattimore, in acrimonious hearings over 12 days in February 1951.Fried, Richard Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 page 148 In March 1950, Senator McCarthy accused Lattimore of being the \\"top Russian agent\\" responsible for the \\"loss of China\\", thereby making Lattimore, a previously little known expert on China, into an internationally famous figure. During the hearings, it became quickly apparent that McCarran and Lattimore deeply disliked each other with the two men frequently engaging in shouting matches and interrupting one another.Oshinksy, David A Conspiracy So Immense Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 page 209. When it was established that Lattimore had met President Truman in 1945 to discuss America's China policy, McCarran sarcastically commented: \\"He visited the President once and forgot it\\". McCarran demanded that Lattimore prove a negative, asking him \\"can you say that the IPR and you had no influence on upon the Far Eastern experts in the State Department?\\" McCarran worked to establish that Lattimore was the man responsible for the \\"loss of China\\", claiming General George Marshall's policy during his 1945 to 1947 diplomatic mission to China during that country's civil war between nationalists and communists as being \\"substantially the same\\" as that recommended by Lattimore. At the end of the hearings, McCarran gave Lattimore what was described as a \\"tongue lashing\\", stating he was \\"so flagrantly defiant\\" and \\"so persistent in his efforts to confuse and obscure the facts that the committee feels constrained to take due notice of his conduct...That he has uttered untruths stands clear in the record\\". The report of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee written by McCarran concluded that China was indeed \\"lost\\" because of the policy followed by the State Department, declaring: \\"Owen Lattimore and John Carter Vincent were influential in bringing about a change in United States policy...favorable to the Chinese Communists\\". Through McCarran was careful not to call Lattimore a Soviet spy in his report, which would have allowed him to sue for libel, he came very close with the statement: \\"Owen Lattimore was, from some time beginning in the 1930s, a conscious, articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy\\". McCarran subsequently pushed successfully for Lattimore to be indicted for perjury. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he held up the nomination of Truman's nominee for Attorney General, James McGranery, until McGanery promised to indict Lattimore.Fried, Richard Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 page 149. Lattimore's lawyer Abe Fortas defended him by claiming McCarran had deliberately asked questions about arcane and obscure matters that took place in the 1930s in the hope that Lattimore would not be able to recall them properly, thereby giving grounds for perjury indictments. Federal Judge Luther Youngdahl later dismissed all seven charges against Lattimore on the grounds that the matters in question were insubstantial, of little concern to McCarran's inquiry, or the result of questions phrased in such a way that they could not be fairly answered.Haynes & Klehr Early Cold War Spies; p. 47; US Senate, 82nd Congress, 2nd Session, Committee on the Judiciary, Institute of Pacific Relations, Report No. 2050, p. 224 On 27 July 1953, the armistice of Panmunjom was signed ending the Korean War. McCarran attracted national attention when he criticized President Dwight Eisenhower on the Senate floor for signing the armistice, which he called \\"a perpetuation of a fraud on this country and the United Nations\\".Ybarra, Michael J. Washington Gone Crazy: Senator Pat McCarran and the Great American Communist Hunt, Hanover: Steerforth Press, 2004 page 714 McCarran believed that the United States and the rest of its allies fighting under the United Nations banner in Korea should have fought on until all of Korea was unified under the leadership of President Syngman Rhee, which led him to see the armistice as a sort of American defeat. =Changes to immigration law= In June 1952, McCarran joined Francis Walter in sponsorship of the McCarran-Walter Act, a law that abolished racial restrictions found in United States immigration and naturalization statutes going back to the Naturalization Act of 1790 and also imposed more rigid restrictions on quotas for immigrants entering the United States. It also stiffened the existing law relating to the admission, exclusion and deportation of dangerous aliens (as defined by the McCarran Internal Security Act). In response to the act he made a well known statement: Some of the immigration provisions of the act were later superseded by the 1965 Immigration Act, but the power of the government to deny visas for ideological reasons remained on the books another 25 years after that. Death and burial McCarran died in Hawthorne, Nevada on September 28, 1954, shortly after leaving the stage following a speech he gave at a political rally. According to news accounts published after his death, McCarran suffered a fatal heart attack, after having recovered from attacks in 1951 and 1953. McCarran was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Reno. Family In 1903, McCarran married Harriet Martha \\"Birdie\\" Weeks (1882‚Äì1963). They were the parents of four daughters and one son. Samuel McCarran became a doctor and worked in Reno. Margaret and Mary became members of the Order of Dominican Sisters. Norine was a longtime employee of the Library of Congress. Patricia became the wife of Edwin Parry Hay of Maryland. Legacy McCarran is remembered as one of the few Democrats to oppose President Franklin D. Roosevelt and reject the New Deal. In addition, he was a proponent of the aviation industry; he was a sponsor of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 and the Federal Airport Act of 1945, and was a proponent of establishing the United States Army Air Forces as the United States Air Force separate from the Army. He was also an ardent anti-Communist. Harold L. Ickes described McCarran as \\"easy-going, old-shoe 'Pat'\\" in a column criticizing McCarran as a tool of the oil companies, for not supporting certain regulations Ickes favored. American journalist John Gunther was also critical of McCarran's alleged corporate ties, writing that he resembled gold \\"in that he is soft, heavy, and not a good conductor.\\" Postcard depicting McCarran at the dedication ceremony for the original McCarran Field, now Nellis Air Force Base McCarran International Airport located in Las Vegas, Nevada is named after Senator McCarran. McCarran Boulevard in Reno is named for Pat McCarran, as is McCarran Street in North Las Vegas. Statue in the National Statuary Hall Collection A statue of McCarran is included in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. Each state is allowed to display likenesses of two individuals; Nevada's are those of McCarran and Sarah Winnemucca. =Possible statue removal= In 2017, Nevada's three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote to Governor Brian Sandoval and state legislative leaders and stated their view that review of McCarran's career might warrant removal of his statue from the National Statuary Hall Collection. On January 11, 2017, it was reported that a poll of Nevada legislators indicated support for removing McCarran's statue from the collection. A bill introduced in the Nevada State Senate, SB 174, which called for the removal of the statue and renaming of McCarran International Airport for former U.S. Senator Harry Reid, failed to be passed before the end of the 2017 legislative session on June 1, 2017.

Starting out in vaudeville as a child acrobat, she studied ballet and wished to have a serious career in music and dance, graduating to decades of stage musical revues, cabaret and summer stock. In her 40s, she began a celebrated career as a comedian on television, starring in six series and guest starring on successful television programs from the 1940s to the 1990s. She was nominated for five Emmy Awards for Your Show of Shows, winning Best Actress in 1951 and singled out for a Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting in 1953. Coca was also nominated for a Tony Award in 1978 for On the Twentieth Century and received a sixth Emmy nomination at the age of 80 for an episode of Moonlighting. She possessed a rubbery face capable of the broadest expressions ‚Äî Life magazine compared her to Beatrice Lillie and Charlie Chaplin and described her characterizations as taking \\"people or situations suspended in their own precarious balance between dignity and absurdity, and push(ing) them over the cliff with one single, pointed gesture\\". The magazine noted a \\"particularly high-brow critic\\" as observing, \\"The trouble with most comedians who try to do satire is that they are essentially brash, noisy and indelicate people who have to use a sledge hammer to smash a butterfly. Miss Coca, on the other hand, is the timid woman who, when aroused, can beat a tiger to death with a feather.\\" Aside from vaudeville, cabaret, film, theater and television, she voiced children's cartoons and was even featured in the 1984 MTV music video \\"Bag Lady\\" by the band EBN-OZN, ultimately working well into her 80s. In a 1999 interview, Robert Ozn said during the shoot she was required to sit on the sidewalk in snow for hours during a blizzard with 15 degree temperatures. \\"While the rest of us 20-somethings were moaning about the weather, warming ourselves by a heater, this little 75-year-old lady never once complained - put us all to shame.

Coca's father was of Spanish descent (the family surname was originally Fern√°ndez y Coca), the son of Joseph F. Coca, Sr. and his wife, Laura. Coca took lessons in piano, dance and voice as a child and while still a teenager moved from Philadelphia to New York City to become a dancer. She got her first job in the chorus of the Broadway musical When You Smile and became a headliner in Manhattan nightclubs with music arranged by her first husband, Robert Burton. She gained prominence when she began to combine music with comedy; her first critical success was in New Faces of 1934. A well- received part of her act was a comic striptease, during which Coca made sultry faces and gestures but would manage to remove only one glove. She committed this routine to film in the Educational Pictures comedy short The Bashful Ballerina (1937) and co-starred opposite another newcomer to films, Danny Kaye, in Educational's 1937 short Dime a Dance. Both of these comedies were filmed in New York. Career She played opposite Sid Caesar on The Admiral Broadway Revue (January to June 1949), and then in the sketch comedy program Your Show of Shows, which was immensely popular from 1950 to 1954, winning the Emmy for Outstanding Variety Series in 1952 and 1953. The 90-minute show was aired live on NBC every Saturday night in prime time. She won the second-ever Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1951 and was nominated for four other Emmys for her work in the show. She won a 1953 Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting.1954 Peabody Award, imdb.com; accessed May 12, 2014. Her success in that program earned her her own series, The Imogene Coca Show, which ran 1954-55. Billy Booth in the NBC comedy series Grindl, circa 1964. Prior to working with Caesar she had starred in an early ABC series, Buzzy Wuzzy, which lasted four episodes in 1948.Buzzy Wuzzy profile, imdb.com; accessed May 12, 2014. She went on to star in two more series. In the 1963‚Äì64 TV season, Coca portrayed a comic temporary helper in the NBC sitcom Grindl. It competed with the second half of The Ed Sullivan Show and lasted only one season. Coca later starred as a cave woman with Joe E. Ross in the 1966‚Äì67 time-travel satire sitcom It's About Time. She continued to appear on comedy and variety series throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s including several appearances each on The Carol Burnett Show, The George Gobel Show, The Hollywood Palace and Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town and Bob Hope specials. She appeared on other shows and specials by Dean Martin, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Lewis, Dick Clark, Danny Kaye and Andy Williams. The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner and Howard Morris Special won a 1967 Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special.

In 1988, Coca appeared as the mother of Allyce Beasley's Agnes in the Moonlighting episode \\"Los Dos Dipestos\\", written by David Steinberg. She received her sixth Emmy nomination, as Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series, for the role. The same year she was the female recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in Comedy at the second annual American Comedy Awards, alongside male recipient George Burns.IMDb general profile; accessed May 12, 2014. Coca appeared only sporadically in films such as The Incredible Incident at Independence Square, filmed in her hometown of Philadelphia, as well as Under the Yum Yum Tree (1963), Nothing Lasts Forever, Papa Was a Preacher, Buy & Cell and National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), as \\"Aunt Edna\\". After having appeared in several Broadway musical-comedy revues and plays between the 1930s and the 1950s, Coca returned to Broadway at the age of 70 with a Tony Award-nominated performance as religious zealot Letitia Primrose in On the Twentieth Century, a 1978 stage musical adapted from the film Twentieth Century (1934). Her role, that of a religious fanatic who plasters decals onto every available surface, had been a male in both the film and the original stage production, and was rewritten specifically as a vehicle for Coca. She appeared in the Broadway run with Kevin Kline and Madeline Kahn, continued with the national tour starring Rock Hudson and Judy Kaye and returned for a later tour revival in the mid-1980s with Kaye and Frank Gorshin. She also co-starred with singer Maxine Sullivan in My Old Friends and touring productions including musicals such as Once Upon a Mattress and Bells Are Ringing and plays such as The Prisoner of Second Avenue and Luv. She rejoined Sid Caesar in 1961‚Äì62, 1977 and 1990‚Äì91 for a traveling stage revue and made an appearance with Caesar and Howard Morris at Comic Relief VI in 1994. One of Coca's early stock characters on the Caesar series blended comedy with socially conscious pathos as a bag lady and she was frequently asked to reprise the role, including by Carol Burnett for her 60s series and by Red Skelton as love interest to one of his own familiar characters in the 1981 TV special Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner. New wave group ƒíbn-≈åzn featured Coca as the title character in the music video to their song \\"Bag Lady (I Wonder)\\", which was a top-40 dance hit in 1984. Life and legacy The handprints of Coca in front of Hollywood Hills Amphitheater at Walt Disney World's Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park. Coca had no children, but had been married twice; for 21 years to Bob Burton, from 1935 until his death in 1955 and later for 27 years to King Donovan, from 1960 until his death in 1987. Burton's death came only one month after her mother had died. Coca was a practicing Roman Catholic. Coca was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.Motion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers Hours after Coca and Donovan completed their New Year's Eve 1972 performance of \\"Fourposter\\" at the Showboat Dinner Theater in St. Petersburg, Florida, they were involved in a serious auto accident. They had been driving in foggy weather to their home in Clearwater, Florida, when Donovan collided with another car driven by 19-year-old Cheryl Lynn Rice. Rice was unharmed, but Donovan sustained a slight leg injury, and the rear-view mirror entered Coca's right eye, smashing her cheekbone. Transported to the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Coca underwent plastic surgery and a cosmetic lens covered her now-blind eye for the rest of her career, which resumed with her long stint in Broadway's On the Twentieth Century beginning in 1978.Gliato, T, Sweet Imogene, People Magazine, June 18, 2001; accessed May 11, 2014. Performers citing Coca as an influence include Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin, Whoopi Goldberg and Tracey Ullman. Your Show of Shows is considered a television classic and was the basis for a well-received 1982 film, My Favorite Year. A 1992 musical version of the film made its way to Broadway, in which comedic actress Andrea Martin won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Alice Miller. In 1995, Coca was honored with the second annual Women in Film Lucy Award,Women In Film Lucy Award, imdb.com; accessed May 12, 2014. honoring women's achievement in television and named after Lucille Ball.

Background and education Lord Haddington was the only son of Lady Sophia, daughter of John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun and Charles Hamilton, 8th Earl of Haddington. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and Christ Church, Oxford. Political career At the beginning of the 19th century, Lord Haddington was a supporter of George Canning. He was elected as a Member of Parliament for St Germans in 1802, but did not stand for re-election in 1806. In August 1814, he was appointed one of His Majesty's Commissioners for the management of the affairs in India. He served sporadically in the House of Commons until 1827 when he was elevated to the House of Lords by the new prime minister, George Canning, who had him created Baron Melros, of Tynninghame in the County of Haddington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He had previously been created a privy counsellor in 1814, and, in 1828, he succeeded to his family's Scottish earldom. Lord Haddington went on to vote against the Reform Bill in 1831, but later changed his mind and voted for it in 1832, possibly due to the political crises surrounding its passage. Upon the rise of Sir Robert Peel to the premiership in 1834, Lord Haddington was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, however the government collapsed within six months, and the Whigs were once again in power. Lord Haddington was able to return to government in 1841 with the return of Sir Robert Peel to the premiership - he declined the post of Governor General of India, instead opting to become First Lord of the Admiralty and a member of the Cabinet. He held that post until January 1846, when he was shuffled to become Lord Privy Seal, a post he held until the death of the government in July. Lord Binning's family were related to the Stanhopes and staunch supporters of Pitt's administration. Being, as the eldest son of a Scots peer, ineligible for a seat in Scotland, he was provided with an English seat in 1802 ‚Äòunder the peculiar protection of Mr Pitt‚Äô, by Pitt's sister's father-in- law, Lord Eliot. As might have been expected, Binning followed Pitt's line in his first Parliament, voting with him for the orders of the day, 3 June 1803, against Addington, 7 Mar., 13 and 16 Apr. (though on 15 Mar. he did not divide on Pitt's motion on the navy) and also for Fox's and Pitt's defence motions which brought down Addington, 23 and 25 April 1804. He went on to support Pitt's second administration and voted against the censure of Melville, 8 Apr. 1805. He was on the committee which investigated the 11th naval report. After Pitt's death he was one of the Pittite group led by Canning, Sturges Bourne and George Rose which held fortnightly dinners at White's, and became a steward of the Pitt Club. He voted against the Grenville ministry on Ellenborough's seat in the cabinet, 3 March 1806, and against the repeal of Pitt's Additional Force Act, 30 April. On 26 June, he asked why Scotland was excluded from the training bill; on 3 July, when he was teller against the bill, he was put down by the lord advocate who asked him why he wished to extend to Scotland a bill that his fellow oppositionists had been abusing for weeks; but promised to bring in a separate bill for Scotland. Binning found no seat in 1806, though his friend Huskisson reported that he wished Binning's father had allowed him to contest Dover, where he might have got in at modest expense. Melville secured an opening for him from Viscount Lowther on a vacancy at Cockermouth in January 1807: Melville had suggested that Binning might come in for Haslemere on the same interest instead of Viscount Garlies, when the latter succeeded to the title in November 1806, but Binning had to wait for the next vacancy. Cockermouth was only available to him for another year, so at the general election of 1807, he found another seat on Lord Clinton's interest at Callington, through their mutual uncle Francis Drake. Family Lord Haddington married Lady Maria Parker, heir of George Parker, 4th Earl of Macclesfield, in 1802. They had no surviving children and the Earl died in December 1858, aged 78. On his death the barony of Melros became extinct while he was succeeded in the remaining titles by his second cousin, George Baillie-Hamilton. Lady Haddington died in 1861. In 1828 he commissioned William Burn to remodel the family seat of Tyninghame House, which passed with the earldom to Baillie-Hamilton.

Its ingestion and extended exposure are toxic to humans and all classes of livestock; its mechanism of poisoning involves disruption of the central nervous system, with death caused by respiratory paralysis. The biosynthesis of coniine contains as its penultimate step the non-enzymatic cyclisation of 5-oxooctylamine to Œ≥-coniceine, a Schiff base differing from coniine only by its carbon-nitrogen double bond in the ring. This pathway results in natural coniine that is a mixture‚Äîa racemate‚Äîcomposed of two enantiomers, the stereoisomers (S)-(+)-coniine and (R)-(‚àí)-coniine, depending on the direction taken by the chain that branches from the ring. Both enantiomers are toxic, with the (R)-enantiomer being the more biologically active and toxic of the two in general. Coniine holds a place in organic chemistry history as being the first of the important class of alkaloids to be synthesized, by Albert Ladenburg in 1886, and it has been synthesized in the laboratory in a number of unique ways through to modern times. Hemlock poisoning has been a periodic human concern, a regular veterinary concern, and has had significant occurrences in human and cultural history. Notably, in 399 BC, Socrates, when he was sentenced to death, chose to die by drinking a coniine-containing mixture of poison hemlock. Natural origins The poison hemlock plant. Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) contains highly toxic amounts of coniine. Its presence on farmland is an issue for livestock farmers because animals will eat it if they are not well fed or the hemlock is mixed in with pasture grass. The coniine is present in Conium maculatum as a mixture of the R-(‚àí)- and S-(+)-enantiomers. The yellow pitcher plant Coniine is also found in Sarracenia flava, the yellow pitcher plant. The yellow pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant found exclusively in the southeastern United States. The plant uses a mixture of sugar and coniine to simultaneously attract and poison insects, which then fall into a digestive tube. Coniine is also found in Aethusa cynapium, commonly known as fool's parsley. History of natural isolates The history of coniine is understandably tied to the poison hemlock plant, since the natural product was not synthesizable until the 1880s. The most famous hemlock poisoning occurred in 399 BCE, when the philosopher Socrates is believed to have consumed a liquid infused with hemlock to carry out his death sentence, his having been convicted of impiety toward the gods, and the corruption of youth. Hemlock juice was often used to execute criminals in ancient Greece. Hemlock has had a limited medical use throughout history. The Greeks used it not just as capital punishment, but also as an antispasmodic and treatment for arthritis. Books from the 10th century attest to medical use by the Anglo-Saxons. In the Middle Ages it was believed that hemlock could be used to cure rabies; in later European times it came to be associated with flying ointments in witchcraft. Native Americans used hemlock extract as arrow poison. While the yellow pitcher plant and fool's parsley also contain coniine, there are no reports of traditional uses for these plants. Pharmacology and toxicology The (R)-(‚àí) enantiomer of coniine is the more biologically active, at least in one system (TE-671 cells expressing human fetal nicotinic neuromuscular receptors), and in mouse bioassay, the same enantiomer and the racemic mixture are about two- fold more toxic than the (S)-(+) enantiomer (see below). Coniine, as racemate or as pure enantiomer, begins by binding and stimulating the nicotinic receptor on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. The subsequent depolarization results in nicotinic toxicity; as coniine stays bound to the receptor, the nerve stays depolarized, inactivating it. This results, systemically, in a flaccid paralysis, an action similar to that of curare. Symptoms of paralysis generally occur within a half-hour, although death may take several hours. The central nervous system is not affected: the person remains conscious and aware until respiratory paralysis results in cessation of breathing. The flaccid, muscular paralysis is an ascending paralysis, lower limbs being first affected. The person may have a hypoxic convulsion just prior to death, disguised by the muscular paralysis such that the person may just weakly shudder. Cause of death is lack of oxygen to the brain and heart as a consequence of respiratory paralysis, so that a poisoned person may recover if artificial ventilation can be maintained until the toxin is removed from the victim's system. The LD50 values (in mouse, i.v. administered) for the R-(‚àí) and S-(+) enantiomers, and the racemate, are approximately 7 and 12, and 8 milligrams per kilogram, respectively.

D-(S)-Coniine has since been determined to be a colorless alkaline liquid, with a penetrating odour and a burning taste; has D0¬∞ 0.8626 and D19¬∞ 0.8438, refractive index n23¬∞D 1.4505, and is dextrorotatory, [Œ±]19¬∞D +15.7¬∞. (See comments about the specific rotation below, under \\"Enantiomers\\".) L-(R)-Coniine has [Œ±]21¬∞D 15¬∞ and in other respects resembles its D-isomer, but the salts have slightly different melting points; the platinichloride has mp. 160 ¬∞C (L√∂ffler and Friedrich report 175 ¬∞C), the aurichloride mp. 59 ¬∞C.Ahrens, Ber., 1902, 35, 1330L√∂ffler and Friedrich, Ber., 1909, 42, 107. =Solubility= Coniine is slightly soluble (1 in 90) in cold water, less so in hot water, so that a clear cold solution becomes turbid when warmed. On the other hand, the base dissolves about 25% of water at room temperature. It mixes with alcohol in all proportions, is readily soluble in ether and most organic solvents. Coniine dissolves in carbon disulfide, forming a complex thiocarbamate.Melzer, Arch. Pharm., 1898, 236, 701cf. Dilling, Pharm. J., 1909, [iv], 29, 34, 70, 102. =Crystallization= Coniine solidifies into a soft crystalline mass at ‚àí2 ¬∞C. It slowly oxidizes in the air. The salts crystallize well and are soluble in water or alcohol. The hydrochloride, B‚Ä¢HCl, crystallizes from water in rhombs, mp. 220 ¬∞C, [Œ±]20¬∞D +10.1¬∞; the hydrobromide, in needles, mp. 211 ¬∞C, and the D-acid tartrate, B‚Ä¢C4H6O6‚Ä¢2 H2O, in rhombic crystals, mp. 54 ¬∞C.

The aurichloride, B‚Ä¢HAuCl4, crystallizes on standing, mp. 77 ¬∞C. The picrate forms small yellow needles, mp. 75 ¬∞C, from hot water. The 2,4-dinitrobenzoyl- and 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl- derivates have mps. 139.0‚Äì139.5 ¬∞C and 108‚Äì9 ¬∞C respectively.Sp√§th, Kuffner and Ensfellner, Ber., 1933, 66, 596. The precipitate afforded by potassium cadmium iodide solution is crystalline, mp. 118 ¬∞C, while that given by nicotine with this reagent is amorphous. =Color changes= Coniine gives no coloration with sulfuric or nitric acid. Sodium nitroprusside gives a deep red color, which disappears on warming, but reappears on cooling, and is changed to blue or violet by aldehydes.Gabutti, Chem. Soc. Abstr., 1906, [ii], 711. =Specific rotation= The stereochemical composition of \\"coniine\\" is a matter of some importance, since its two enantiomers do not have identical biological properties, and many of the older pharmacological studies on this compound were carried out using the naturally-occurring isomeric mixture. S-(+)-Coniine has a specific rotation, [Œ±]D, of +8.4¬∞ (c = 4.0, in CHCl3). These authors note that Ladenburg's value,A. Ladenburg (1888) Justus Liebig's Ann. Chem. 247 1-98. +15¬∞, is for a \\"neat\\", i.e. undiluted, sample. A similarly high value of +16¬∞ for the [Œ±]D of \\"coniine\\" is given, without explicit citation of the source, in The Merck Index.The Merck Index, 15th Ed. (2013), p. 446, Monograph 2489, O'Neil: The Royal Society of Chemistry. http://www.rsc.org/Merck-Index/monograph/mono1500002489 The value of +7.7¬∞ (c = 4.0, CHCl3) for synthetic S-(+)-coniine and -7.9¬∞ (c = 0.5, CHCl3) for synthetic R-(‚àí)-coniine is given by other chemists.D. Enders and J. Tiebes (1993) Liebig's Ann. Chem. 173-177. The hydrochloride salts of the (S)-(+) and (R)-(‚àí) enantiomers of coniine have values of [Œ±]D of +4.6¬∞ and -5.2¬∞, respectively (c = 0.5, in methanol). Synthesis The original synthesis (shown in the scheme below) of Coniine was performed by Ladenburg in 1886. Ladenburg heated an iodide salt of N-methylpyridine to 250 ¬∞C, obtaining 2-methylpyridine. He then performed Knoevenagel condensation with acetaldehyde in anhydrous zinc chloride to yield 2-propenylpyridine. In fact, Ladenburg used paraldehyde, a cyclic trimer of acetaldehyde that readily forms acetaldehyde upon heating. Finally, 2-propenylpyridine was reduced with metallic sodium in ethanol to provide racemic (¬±) coniine. Fractional crystallisation of racemic coniine with (+)-tartaric acid yielded enantiopure coniine. Original Synthesis by Ladenburg The scheme proposed by Ladenburg gave poor yields, so the quest for alternative routes was open. A slightly better yield is observed if 2-methylpyridine and acetaldehyde are heated in a sealed tube with hydrochloric acid for 10 hours. A mixture of 2-propenylpyridine and 2-chloropropylpyridine is formed and is subsequently reduced by sodium in ethanol to give rac-coniine. Note: although the scheme below shows a single enantiomer of coniine, the final reaction produces a racemic mixture that is then separated :450px In 1907, another route with better yield was proposed. First, 2-(2'-hydroxypropyl)pyridine is reduced with phosphorus and fuming hydroiodic acid at 125 ¬∞C. Second, the product is treated with zinc dust and water. Finally, the product of the second step is treated with sodium in ethanol. Note: although the scheme below shows a single enantiomer of coniine, the final reaction produces a racemic mixture that is then separated :450px A number of other syntheses of coniine have been effected, of which that of Diels and Alder is of special interest.Diels and Alder, Annalen, 1932, 498, 16. The initial adduct of pyridine and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate is tetramethylquinolizine-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate, which on oxidation with dilute nitric acid is converted into trimethyl indolizine-tricarboxylate. This, on hydrolysis and decarboxylation, furnishes indolizine, the octahydro- derivate of which, also known as octahydropyrrocoline is converted by the cyanogen bromide method successively into the bromocyanoamide, cyanoamide and rac.-coniine. A synthesis of the alkaloid, starting from indolizine (pyrrocoline) is described by Ochiai and Tsuda.Ber., 1934, 67, 1011. :450px The preparation of L-(R)-coniine by the reduction of Œ≤-coniceine (L-propenylpiperidine) by L√∂ffler and Friedrich provides means for converting conhydrine to L-(R)-coniine. Hess and Eichel reported,Ber., 1917, 50, 1192, 1386. incorrectly,Pelletierine is now known to be 1-(2-piperidinyl)-2-propanone; see: The Merck Index, 15th Ed. (2013), p. 1314, Monograph 7181, O'Neil: The Royal Society of Chemistry. Available online at: http://www.rsc.org/Merck-Index/monograph/mono1500007181 that pelletierine was the aldehyde (Œ≤-2-piperidyl-propaldehyde) corresponding to coniine, and yielded rac-coniine when its hydrazone was heated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol at 156‚Äì170 ¬∞C. According to these authors, D-(S)-coniine is rendered almost optically inactive when heated with barium hydroxide and alcohol at 180‚Äì230 ¬∞C. LeitheBer., 1932, 65, 927. has shown by observation of the optical rotation of (+)-pipecolic acid (piperidine-2-carboxylic acid) and some of its derivatives under varying conditions, that it must belong to the D-series of amino acids. Currently, Coniine, and many other alkaloids, can be synthesized stereoselectively. For example, Pd-catalyzed 1,3-chirality transfer reaction can stereospecifically transform a single enantiomer of an allyl alcohol into a cyclic structure (in this case a piperidine). In this way, starting from (S)-alcohol an (S)-enantiomer of Coniine is obtained and vice versa. Remarkably, the separation of racemic alcohol into different enantiomers is done with the help of Candida antarctica lipase. Biosynthesis  The biosynthesis of coniine is still being investigated, much of the pathway has been elucidated. Originally thought to use 4 acetyl groups as feed compounds for the polyketide synthase that forms coniine,Leete E (1964) Biosynthesis of the hemlock alkaloids. The incorporation of acetate-1-C14 into coniine and conhydrine. J Am Chem Soc 86, 2509‚Äì2513 it is in fact derived from two malonyl and a butyryl CoA, which are derived in the usual way from acetyl-CoA.Hannu Hotti, Tuulikki Seppanen-Laakso, Mikko Arvas, Teemu H. Teeri and Heiko Rischer, Polyketide synthases from poison hemlock (Conium maculatum L.)

Ketooctanal then undergoes transamination using alanine:5-keto-octanal aminotransferase.Roberts MF Phytochemistry 17 1978, 107-112 The amine then spontaneously cyclizes and is dehydrated to form the coniine precursor Œ≥‚Äìconiceine. This is then reduced using NADPH dependent y-coniceine reductase to form coniine. 750px In popular culture Coniine is the murder weapon in Agatha Christie's mystery novel Five Little Pigs. The R and S 2-Propylpiperidine stereoisomers are a neurotoxin present in a slug-like lifeform in The Expanse. The toxin is shown as causing almost instant death upon skin contact in the show.

His younger brother was the Prime Minister Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon, 1st Viscount Goderich, known to history as \\"Lord Goderich\\". Inheritance In 1786 he succeeded his father as 3rd Baron Grantham. In 1792 he became the heir of his distant cousinMargaret Robinson, a sister of his great-great- grandfather Sir Thomas Robinson (d.1676) (younger brother of Sir Metcalf Robinson, 1st Baronet (1609-1668) and father of Sir William Robinson, 1st Baronet (d.1736) (created 1689)), married William Weddell of Earswick, York (The Tourist's Guide; being a concise history and description of Ripon, 1838, pp.120-1 ) William Weddell (1736-1792) of Newby Hall in Yorkshire, a notable art collector.

He also inherited her estate of Wrest Park in Silsoe, Bedfordshire. Career In 1798 he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating MA in 1801. He was made Privy Counsellor in December 1834 while holding office as First Lord of the Admiralty till April 1835, and a Knight of the Garter in 1844. He was colonel-commandant of the Yorkshire Hussars, a part-time Yeomanry Cavalry regiment, for over forty years and was appointed yeomanry aide-de-camp to William IV and held similar position under Queen Victoria. Lord Grantham was nominated as Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire in 1818, an office which he held until his death. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from September 1841 to July 1844. During his time in Ireland he disagreed with Peel's religious conciliation of Ireland, claiming that economic conciliation was a greater priority.C. Read, \\"Peel, De Grey and Irish Policy 1841‚Äì44\\" History, January 2014, p. 1-18. He called for more legislation focused on Ireland whilst Peel pursued economic legislation aimed at benefitting the UK as a whole. =Other public positions= On the founding of the Institute of British Architects in London in 1834 he was invited to become its first president remaining so till his death in 1859. The institute received its Royal Charter in 1837 becoming Royal Institute of British Architects in London; he was also the first president of the Royal Architectural Museum. Earl de Grey was also a fellow of the Royal Society from 1841, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and served as one of the New Buckingham Palace Commissioners from 1848. He remodelled his London townhouse at No.4 St James's Square (now the Naval & Military Club) and between February 1833 and October 1839 rebuilt Wrest Park, his seat in Bedfordshire, in the French style, assisted by James Clephan. He redesigned the deer park and added decoration and several statues. Marriage and children In 1805 he married Lady Henrietta Cole, a daughter of William Cole, 1st Earl of Enniskillen, by whom he had two daughters and co-heiresses: *Ann Florence de Grey (Countess Cowper), eldest daughter and co-heiress, who married George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. She was suo jure Baroness Lucas, having inherited that title from her father. *Mary Gertrude de Grey, younger daughter and co-heiress. Death & succession Lord de Grey died in November 1859, aged 77, having survived his wife by eleven years. He was succeeded in the Barony of Lucas of Crudwell by his daughter, Ann de Grey (Countess Cowper), who married George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper.

This allowed the father to determine which son was to receive what portion, typically by seniority. But this was changing at the time allowing some flexibility. In Normandy the law distinguished between acquisitions and inheritances. Acquisitions were those lands obtained by conquest or purchase while his Norman ancestral lands were heritable by the eldest son. This was later codified in the Leges Henrici Primi which stated: \\"The Ancestral fee of the father is to go to the first-born son; but he may give his purchases or later acquisitions to whomsoever he prefers\\". For a time after the Conquest this took the form of the eldest son inheriting the Norman lands of his ancestors while the second son was given the English honors his father had acquired.

Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine, PC (1634‚Äì1705) was an English courtier, diplomat, and briefly a member of parliament, sitting in the House of Commons of England for part of 1660. He was also a noted Roman Catholic writer. His wife Barbara Villiers was one of Charles II's mistresses. Early life Born into a Catholic family, Roger was the son of Sir James Palmer of Dorney Court, Buckinghamshire, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber under King Charles I, and Catherine Herbert, daughter of William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis. He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge. He was admitted at the Inner Temple in 1656. In March 1660, Palmer was elected Member of Parliament for Windsor in the Convention Parliament. Following a double return, he was not seated until 27 April. History of Parliament Online - Palmer, Roger Barbara Villiers In 1660 Barbara Villiers, his wife of one year, became mistress to King Charles II. The king created Palmer Baron Limerick and Earl of Castlemaine in 1661, but the title was limited to his children by Barbara (as opposed, that is, to any later wife he might have) which made it clear to the whole court that the honour was for her services in the King's bedchamber rather than for his in the King's court. This made it more of a humiliation than an honour: Palmer did not want a peerage on these terms, but it was forced on him; and he never took his seat in the Irish House of Lords (although he did use the title). Career While on a prolonged tour in France and Italy, he served as an officer in the fleet of the Venetian Republic in 1664 before returning to England later that year. In 1665 he served under the Duke of York in the Royal Navy during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.Article by R.A.P.J. Beddard. Palmer showed unwavering and public devotion to Roman Catholicism, in spite of heavy legal and social penalties, and also staunchly supported the Stuart monarchy. His loyalty to the throne and the Stuart succession in general and to the person of Charles II in particular forced his acquiescence to his wife's position as the King's mistress. As a prominent Roman Catholic, Castlemaine came under suspicion at the time of the Popish plot alleged by Titus Oates and others. In the atmosphere of anti-Catholic hysteria of the time, Palmer was committed to the Tower of London and subsequently tried at the King's Bench Bar in Westminster for high treason. He had to represent himself and, as shown by the verbatim account in the State Trials, secured his own acquittal with skilful advocacy in his own defence against Judge Jeffreys and Chief Justice Scroggs. He became a member of the English Privy Council in 1686, following James II's accession to the throne. He was appointed Ambassador to the Vatican, where he was ridiculed as Europe's most famous cuckold.Macaulay, Thomas Babington, The History of England from the Accession of James II, Volume II. Philadelphia, J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1878, p. 206. As ambassador, he promoted James's plan to have Pope Innocent XI make his Jesuit privy councillor, Edward Petre, a cardinal. Innocent declined to do so.Macaulay, Thomas Babington, The History of England from the Accession of James II, Volume II. Philadelphia, J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1878, p. 209.Baron Thomas Babington Macaulay. The History of England from the Accession of James II. / Complete Contents of the Five Volumes (Kindle Location 14422). After the Revolution of 1688, Castlemaine fled for refuge to Llanfyllin near his ancestral home in Montgomeryshire and stayed for a while in the house of a recusant there, but he was arrested in Oswestry, Shropshire, and committed to the Tower, spending most of 1689 and part of 1690 there. After enduring almost 16 months in the Tower, he was freed on bail. He was arrested and sent to the Tower again in 1696 after failing to attend the Irish Parliament but was released again 5 months later. Later life He died quietly in Oswestry in 1705 at the age of 70, and was buried in the Herbert family vault at St Mary's Church, Welshpool, Montgomeryshire. His estranged wife Barbara followed him to the grave four years later in 1709. Castlemaine's heirs included his nephew, Charles Palmer of Dorney Court, to whom he left property in Wales which had come to him from his mother's family, but it proved to be heavily encumbered and worth little. His titles became extinct at his death. His wife's sons might technically have claimed them since they were all born while she remained married to him, and there is a presumption of legitimacy in marriage, but no-one ever contended that they were in fact legitimate and no such claim was ever made. The sons had, in any event, all been granted titles of their own by Charles II. The writings of Roger Palmer, Earl of Castlemaine, include the Catholique Apology (1666), The Compendium [of the Popish Plot trials] (1679) and The Earl of Castlemaine's Manifesto (1681). Family On 14 April 1659 he married Barbara Villiers against his family's wishes; his father predicting at the time of the wedding that she would make him one of the most miserable men in the world. Roger was a quiet, studious, bookish man and a devout Roman Catholic while his wife was an accomplished sexual athlete and a woman of whom her later lover, Charles II himself, is recorded by Pepys on 15 May 1663 as having claimed that \\"she hath all the tricks of Aretin that are to be practised to give pleasure\\". At the time of Roger's wedding to Barbara, she was already the mistress of Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield and the marriage does not appear to have prevented her from continuing this relationship nor indeed of seeking out new partners. Within a year, Barbara became the favourite mistress or 'mistresse en titre,' of King Charles II, coincident with his restoration to the throne in May 1660. In an entry to his diary on 13 July 1660, Pepys describes \\"[t]he King and Dukes there with Madame Palmer, a pretty woman that they have a fancy to, to make her husband a cuckold\\". On 25 February 1660 Barbara gave birth to a daughter named Lady Anne Palmer, who Palmer believed was his own daughter. Samuel Pepys in his diary on 23 August 1662 said: \\"But that which pleased me best was that my Lady Castlemayne stood over against us upon a piece of White-hall -- where I glutted myself with looking on her. But methought it was strange to see her Lord and her upon the same place, walking up and down without taking notice one of another; only, at first entry, he put off his hat and she made him a very civil salute -- but afterwards took no notice one of another. But both of them now and then would take their child, which the nurse held in her armes, and dandle it.\\" The child was Anne. However, Charles II also acknowledged her with her sister Charlotte as \\"his dear and natural daughters by the Duchess of Cleveland\\" and described her as \\"the Lady Anne Fitzroy\\" when granting her a patent of the arms granted to her brother Charles, then Earl (later Duke) of Southampton. The Earl of Chesterfield also claimed the child as his own. In early June 1662 Barbara had given birth to a son named Charles who it is believed was fathered by the King. Although Roger Palmer insisted on treating the boy as his and ensured that he was baptised as a Roman Catholic, Barbara snatched away the young boy and arranged for him to be re-christened in the Church of England. Other children followed, none of whom were claimed by Palmer as his own, and most of whom were subsequently acknowledged by Charles II.

It is one of the few woodpeckers that are seen in urban areas. It has a characteristic rattling-whinnying call and an undulating flight. It is the only golden-backed woodpecker with a black throat and a black rump. Taxonomy The black-rumped flameback was described and illustrated by two pre-Linnaean English naturalists from a dried specimen that had been brought to London. In 1738 Eleazar Albin included the bird as the \\"Bengall Woodpecker\\" in his A Natural History of Birds and in 1751 George Edwards included the \\"Spotted Indian Woodpecker\\" in his A Natural History of Uncommon Birds. The black-rumped flameback was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Picus benghalensis. He cited the earlier descriptions by Albin and Edwards. This woodpecker is now placed in the genus Dinopium that was introduced by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1814. Five subspecies are recognised: *The nominate subspecies (D. b. benghalense) is found across India in the low elevations up to about 1000 m. *The race in the arid northwestern India and Pakistan, D. b. dilutum (Blyth, 1852), has pale yellow upperparts, a long crest and whiter underparts than the nominate race of the Gangetic plains. The upperparts have less spots. It prefers to breed in old gnarled tamarisks, Acacia and Dalbergia trunks. *The Southern Peninsular form, D. b. puncticolle (Malherbe, 1845), has a black throat with small triangular white spots and bright golden-yellow upperparts. *The subspecies found in the Western Ghats is separated as D. b. tehminae (Whistler & Kinnear, 1934), (named after the wife of Salim Ali) and is more olive above, has fine spots on the black throat and the wing-covert spots are not distinct. *The northern Sri Lankan race, D. b. jaffnense (Whistler, 1944), has a shorter beak. The Sri Lankan red-backed flameback (Dinopium psarodes) was formerly treated as a subspecies of the black-rumped flameback. It has a crimson back and all the dark markings are blacker and more extensive. It sometimes intergrades with D. b. jaffnense near Puttalam, Kekirawa and Trincomalee. Description Nominate race Kolkata, India. The black-rumped flameback is a large species at 26‚Äì29 cm in length. It has a typical woodpecker shape, and the golden yellow wing coverts are distinctive. The rump is black and not red as in the greater flameback. The underparts are white with dark chevron markings. The black throat finely marked with white immediately separates it from other golden backed woodpeckers in the Indian region. The head is whitish with a black nape and throat, and there is a greyish eye patch. Unlike the greater flameback it has no dark moustachial stripes. The adult male has a red crown and crest. Females have a black forecrown spotted with white, with red only on the rear crest. Young birds are like the female, but duller. A Black-rumped flameback in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects. The black-rumped flameback is the only golden-backed woodpecker with both a black throat and a black rump. Leucistic birds have been recorded. Two specimens of male birds from the northern Western Ghats have been noted to have red-tipped feathers on the malar region almost forming a malar stripe. A female specimen from Lucknow has been noted to have grown an abnormal downcurved hoopoe-like bill. Sri Lankan population D. (b.) psarodes Distribution and habitat This flameback is found mainly on the plains going up to an elevation of about 1200m in Pakistan, India south of the Himalayas and east till the western Assam valley and Meghalaya, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is associated with open forest and cultivation. They are often seen in urban areas with wooded avenues. It is somewhat rare in the Kutch and desert region of Rajasthan. Behaviour and ecology This species is normally seen in pairs or small parties and sometimes joins mixed- species foraging flocks. They forage from the ground to the canopy. They feed on insects mainly beetle larvae from under the bark, visit termite mounds and sometimes feed on nectar. As they make hopping movements around branches, they often conceal themselves from potential predators. They adapt well in human- modified habitats making use of artificial constructions fallen fruits and even food scraps. The breeding season varies with weather and is between February and July. They frequently drum during the breeding season. The nest hole is usually excavated by the birds and has a horizontal entrance and descends into a cavity. Sometimes birds may usurp the nest holes of other birds. Nests have also been noted in mud embankments. The eggs are laid inside the unlined cavity. The normal clutch is three and the eggs are elongate and glossy white. The eggs hatch after about 11 days of incubation. The chicks leave the nest after about 20 days. In culture In Sri Lanka these woodpeckers go by the generic name of k√¶ralaa in Sinhala. In some parts of the island, it is also called kottoruwa although it more often refers to barbets. This bird appears in a 4.50 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.http://www.birdtheme.org/country/srilanka.html It also appears in a 3.75 Taka postal stamp from Bangladesh.

His godparents were King George II, the Earl Cowper (his grandmother's second husband) and his great-aunt the Dowager Viscountess Bateman. His sister Lady Georgiana Spencer married the Duke of Devonshire and became a famed Whig hostess. He was educated at Harrow School from 1770 to 1775 and he won the school's Silver Arrow (an archery prize) in 1771. He then attended Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1776 to 1778 and graduated with a Master of Arts. He acceded to the earldom upon the death of his father in 1783.

Thomas Frognall Dibdin was a Church of England clergyman and bibliographer. The first of his numerous bibliographical works was his Introduction to the Knowledge of Editions of the Classics (1802), which brought him under the notice of Earl Spencer, to whom he owed much important aid in his bibliographical pursuits. The rich library at Althorp was thrown open to him; he spent much of his time in it, and in 1814‚Äì1815 published his Bibliotheca Spenceriana. As the library was not open to the general public, the information given in the Bibliotheca was found very useful, but since its author was unable even to read the characters in which the books he described were written, the work was marred by the errors which more or less characterize all his productions. In 1818 Dibdin was commissioned by Earl Spencer to purchase books for him on the continent, an expedition described in his sumptuous Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany (1821). He was also the author of Aedes Althorpianae, an account of Althorp giving many details of Earl Spencer's library.

His parents chose not to sent him to Eton, which his father had hated. Instead he was educated at the family homes in Hayes and Burton Pynsent in Somerset by a tutor. By 1761 he had four siblings, two sisters Hester and Harriet and two brothers William and James.Reiter p.14 He was emotionally very close to his brothers and disliked whenever he was separated from them. He grew up to be something of a dandy in his dress, and greatly enjoyed hunting.Reiter p.15 Already however, despite his natural intelligence, he was beginning to show signs of laziness that were later to be sharply criticised during his political career.Reiter p.16 To the delight of his father, Pitt began showing interest in pursuing a military career.Reiter p.17 Early career John Singleton Copley's The Death of the Earl of Chatham. Pitt is shown in military uniform to his father's left, while his brothers are also both portrayed. Chatham joined the army as an Ensign in the 47th Regiment of Foot on 14 March 1774. He served as aide-de-camp to General Guy Carleton in Quebec, where they made preparations to resist a planned invasion by American forces. In October 1775 he departed for London carrying dispatches, missing the Battle of Quebec that took place at the end of the year where Carleton successfully defended the city.Reiter p.20 Back in Britain, under strong family pressure, Pitt resigned his commission in early 1776 in protest against the war with America, to which his father was vehemently opposed. He became effective head of the family due to his father's ill health, and took an increasing interest in politics. It was rumoured, at one point, that he might stand for Parliament for Westminster.Reiter p.21 He only returned to the army in March 1778, this time as a Lieutenant in the 39th Foot. France had entered the American War of Independence the previous month, meaning that he was now able to serve without fighting against the Americans. He was due to sail to Gibraltar as aide-de-camp to the lieutenant governor, Colonel Robert Boyd. On 7 April he and his younger brothers were in attendance when their father rose in the House of Lords to give a speech, in which he called for defiance against the French. Shortly after finishing his speech, their father collapsed and died a few weeks later. In John Singleton Copley's painting The Death of the Earl of Chatham, Pitt is portrayed in military uniform at his father's side.Reiter p.22-23 His father's last words at Hayes were reputedly \\"Go my son! Go wherever your country calls you\\". Having succeeded to the Earldom, Chatham spent the following year in Gibraltar before transferring to the West Indies with a newly raised regiment, the 86th Foot. By the end of 1781 he was back in Britain and in 1782 obtained a Captaincy in the London-based 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards. Although he was appointed Colonel in October 1793 and Major General in February 1795, Chatham does not appear to have undertaken any military duties for nearly fifteen years after the end of the War of American Independence in 1783. Political career William Pitt who became Prime Minister in 1783. For much of the 1780s and 1790s Chatham focused on a political career. As heir to his father, he was poised to be a natural leader of his political supporters. However, during the years that Chatham had devoted to his military career these followers were led by Lord Shelburne and then, increasingly, by Chatham's younger brother. Known as William Pitt the Younger, to distinguish him from his father, he had entered Parliament in 1781 and the following year became Chancellor of the Exchequer. By the time Chatham returned permanently to Britain, his brother was already the dominant figure in the family.Reiter p.24-25 Their youngest brother James, a Royal Navy officer, died from fever in Antigua in 1780. Already Chatham was struggling with debt, despite his inheritance, due both to his own overspending and the poor state their father had left the family finances in. Chatham often gambled and became involved in horsebreeding and racing, which turned into expensive pursuits for him.Reiter p.28-29 In July 1783 he married Mary, the second daughter of Thomas Townshend who had been a political ally of his father. It was a love match, rather than an arranged marriage. Mary was known as attractive and very fashionable in societyReiter p.46, although she was to suffer from physical and mental illness throughout their marriage.Reiter p.30-31 Chatham joined with Pitt and Shelburne to oppose the Fox‚ÄìNorth coalition of 1783, but generally kept a low profile during these years. Pitt became prime minister in December 1783. Chatham supported his brother in the Lords, but did not take office. In February 1784 on the way back from an event in the City of London, the brothers were attacked by a mob likely organised by supporters of their rival Charles James Fox. In the subsequent 1784 general election Pitt won a decisive victory, securing his government's future.Reiter p.33 Due to his wife's severe illness, Chatham did not consider himself able to join his brother's government for the next few years, despite rumours linking him to various posts.Reiter p.33-34 =First Lord of the Admiralty= In July 1788 William offered Chatham the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty. 'I have had my doubts whether the public may not think this too much like monopoly,' Pitt confessed, 'but that doubt is not sufficient to counterbalance the personal comfort which will result from it and the general advantage to the whole of our system'. Pitt's cousin William Wyndham Grenville explained the reason for the appointment in more detail: Chatham would connect 'the department of the Admiralty with the rest of the administration, which has never yet been the case under Pitt's government, even in the smallest degree'. In 1790 Chatham oversaw the mobilisation of the navy during the Nookta Sound Crisis with Spain. In gratitude for the successful resolution of the crisis in Britain's favour, George III wanted to award the Order of the Garter to the Prime Minister. Pitt declined the offer, but suggested it be awarded to his brother instead. Chatham accepted the honour, and was immensely proud of it, incorporating the image into the design of his crest, which featured on his carriage and cutlery.Reiter p.47-48 Generally Chatham's tenure as First Lord of the Admiralty was not especially distinguished. Important reforms were shelved and Chatham soon acquired a reputation for disorganisation and laziness. Contemporaries noted 'the inconvenience attending his in bed till the day is advanced, as officers &c; were kept waiting'. During the first major campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars Chatham's Admiralty was blamed in part for the failure of the 1793 Siege of Dunkirk. Due to miscommunication between the Board of Ordnance and the Admiralty, the ships carrying siege weaponry and supplies for the besieging forces arrived two weeks late. Although in this instance Chatham does not seem to have been guilty of any neglect, his reputation was fatally compromised. A further disappointment took place during the Siege of Toulon, in which the Allies suffered a defeat. It was around this time that he earned his nickname of 'the late Lord Chatham' due to his unpunctuality. The Admiralty was also criticised in the press for the failure of the Royal Navy to engage in a major fleet engagement against the French during the opening months of the war, until the Glorious First of June in 1794. Even this was an ambivalent victory for Chatham, as the victorious British had been unable to prevent a major convoy arriving in France from West Indies, undermining the blockade.Reiter p.59-60 Chatham had grown increasingly frustrated by the interference at the Admiralty by colleagues, particularly Henry Dundas.Reiter p.57 =Demotion= As Master-General of the Ordnance Chatham was sceptical about the benefits of Martello Towers but oversaw their construction as part of a response to the threat of French invasion. Chatham had become a magnet for criticism of the government, something which his relationship to the Prime Minister did not help. After a further disagreement between Chatham and Dundas, Pitt was forced to choose between them. Dundas has become a trusted ally, and the Prime Minister chose back him rather than his brother.Reiter p.62-63In December 1794 Pitt finally responded to pressure and moved his brother to the less responsible post of Lord Privy Seal. He chose to demote Chatham by letter rather than in person as this \\"must be unnessicarily distressing to us both\\".Reiter p.63-64 Chatham was furious about his dismissal and demanded to see Pitt in person, which eventually the Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to. Their meeting was not productive and Chatham considered refusing his new office, shattering the image of unity in the cabinet that Pitt wanted to project. Eventually, Pitt persuaded the King to make the offer directly which Chatham reluctantly accepted.Reiter p.64-65 He believed that it would be thought that he had been removed from the Admiralty because the government had no confidence in his management of it. He was replaced by Lord Spencer. As he feared, almost immediately the opposition did launch attacks in the Commons on his alleged mismanagement.Reiter p.69-69 After losing the Admiralty, Chatham's relationship with his brother never fully recovered.Reiter p.70-71 Two years later Chatham was promoted to Lord President of the Council. Although he was tempted to reject the offer, he accepted what was intended as an olive branch by Pitt.Reiter p.71 The two publicly reconciled and Chatham visited Pitt at Howood. Nonetheless there was a lack of the old warmth between them, and Chatham increasingly took an independent line in the cabinet where he had previusly been a close supporter of Pitt.Reiter p.71-73 =Ordnance department= Here he stayed, remaining in office after Pitt's resignation under Henry Addington, until a cabinet reshuffle in June 1801 moved him to the post of Master-General of the Ordnance. He continued in this post until May 1810, with only a short interval out of office in 1806‚Äì1807. He became the General Officer in Command of the Eastern District in 1806. Later military career and Walcheren Chatham commanded a brigade in the unsuccessful Helder Campaign of 1799. Seeing action for the first time he was wounded in the shoulder by a spent musket ball. In 1798 Chatham returned to the army. He was appointed to command a brigade in the Helder campaign in 1799. He was wounded by a spent ball at the Battle of Castricum on 6 October. After this he served as commander of various military districts, but for some reason was passed over in favour of Arthur Wellesley for a command in the Peninsular War. In May 1809 the Secretary of State for War, Lord Castlereagh, offered Chatham the command of an amphibious assault aimed at destroying the French fleet and fortifications around Antwerp and the island of Walcheren. Chatham commanded the largest expeditionary force Britain had yet fielded in the war. Despite early success in taking the town of Flushing, the campaign was an unmitigated disaster. The army made slow headway and the French immediately withdrew their fleet to Antwerp, a tactic that should have been foreseen by the politicians, admirals and generals planning the campaign from the start. While Chatham quarrelled with the naval commander, Sir Richard Strachan, as many as 8000 British troops succumbed to malaria. Chatham was recalled in disgrace. His appearance before a parliamentary enquiry did him no favours, particularly when it emerged that he had presented the King with a private memorandum which ought to have gone to the Secretary of State for War first. Spencer Perceval's government withdrew its support from Chatham and he was forced to resign from the Ordnance in May 1810. Chatham's political and military reputation was ruined. A poem circulated making fun of his inactivity and the lack of co-operation between the army and navy: Later life Shield of arms of John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, KG, PC Arms: Sable, a fess chequy argent and azure between three bezants. Chatham did not serve actively again, but was promoted to full General in January 1812. He continued to hold various ceremonial positions: he had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jersey and High Steward of Colchester in 1807, and in 1820 succeeded the Duke of Kent as Governor of Gibraltar. He died at his house in Charles Street, London, on 24 September 1835, aged 78.The Gentleman's Magazine, volume 4 (1835), p. 546. Family Chatham married The Hon.

It was held in succession by the families of Woodville (or Wydeville), Darcy and Savage. History The first creation was made for Richard Woodville, 1st Baron Rivers, in 1466 and remained in this family until 1491. As borne by the Woodvilles the title was not derived from the name of a place, but from an ancient family name, Redvers, or Reviers, members of this family, whose arms are quartered on the Rivers shield, having been sometime Earls of Devon. The second creation was made in 1626 for Thomas Darcy, 1st Viscount Colchester, who had succeeded as 3rd Baron Darcy of Chiche (created in 1551). In 1613, a reversion of the barony was granted to Sir Thomas Savage, Bt (created Viscount Savage in 1626 and son-in-law of Darcy); this creation and the earldom both had a remainder to Darcy's heirs male of his body, with remainder to Savage and the heirs male of his body. Savage's son John succeeded to the Savage baronetcy and viscountcy in 1635. In 1640 on the death of the 1st Earl, John succeeded to the 1613 reversion of the Darcy of Chiche barony, the Colchester viscountcy and the Rivers earldom; the 1551 creation of the Darcy of Chiche barony became extinct. The earldom and the subsidiary titles became extinct when John Savage, 5th Earl Rivers, died in 1737. Elizabeth, Viscountess Savage, wife of Thomas, 1st Viscount Savage, daughter of the 1st Earl Rivers and mother of the 2nd Earl, was created Countess Rivers in her own right in 1641. This title was for life only, and became extinct at her death in 1650. A new Rivers barony, held by the family of Pitt and its later representative, that of Pitt-Rivers, was in existence from 1776 to 1880.

It occurs widely in the Indian subcontinent, eastwards to southern China, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, western and central Java and northeast Borneo. Taxonomy Recent taxonomic evidenceCollar, N. J. (2011) suggested the species be split into the following species: *Greater flameback, (C. guttacristatus) (C. lucidus if taken as a group and not split) *Crimson-backed flameback, (C. stricklandi) of Sri Lanka. *Javan flameback (C. strictus) of eastern Java, and Bali and Kangean Islands *Luzon flameback (C. haematribon) of Luzon, Polillo, Catanduanes and Marinduque in the northern Philippines *Yellow-faced flameback (C. xanthocephalus) of Negros, Guimaras, Panay, Masbate and Ticao Philippine Islands *Buff-spotted flameback (C. lucidus) of Bohol, Leyte, Samar, Biliran, Panaon, Mindando, Basilan and Samal Philippine Islands *Red-headed flameback (C. erythrocephalus) of Balabac, Palawan, Busuanga and Calamian Philippine Islands Description The greater flameback is a large woodpecker, at 33 cm in length. It is of typical woodpecker shape, has an erect crest and a long neck. Coloration is highly variable between subspecies; it always has unmarked golden-yellow to dark brown back and wings. The rump is red and the tail is black. The underparts are white with dark markings (chevrons, stripes, or bands), or light brown. The head is whitish with a black pattern, or it is yellow, brown or red. The straight pointed bill is long (longer than the head) and - like the legs and four-toed zygodactyl feet (two toes pointing forward, two backward) - lead-grey. The eyes' irides are whitish to yellow.Noske (1991), Grimmett et al. (1999) thumbnail The adult male greater flameback always has a red crown. Females have a crown color varying between subspecies, such as black spotted with white, yellow, or brown with lighter dots. Young birds are like the female, but duller, with brown irides. Calls of C. l. socialis, recorded in Wayanad district, Kerala (India) =Similar species= Head pattern of Western Ghats greater flameback (C. l. socialis). The thin and divided black \\"moustache\\" can be used to distinguish it from similar Dinopium flamebacks. White-and-black-headed greater flameback subspecies resemble some of the three-toed Dinopium flamebacks, but are not particularly closely related. Unlike the black-rumped flameback (D. benghalense) and the common flameback (D. javanense), the greater flameback's dark moustache stripes are divided by white (making them inconspicuous at a distance); except in stricklandi, their hindneck is white (not black), and even in the Sri Lankan birds the dark colour does not extend to between the shoulders as it does in Dinopium; consequently, when seen from behind the black-and-white-headed greater flamebacks outside Sri Lanka show a white neck bordered with black on the sides, while the Dinopium species have a black neck and upper back, with thin white borders to the neck. Those flamebacks are also smaller (though this is only reliable in direct comparison), have a bill that is shorter than the head, and dark irises. Convergent evolution in plumage between a larger and a smaller species is also found among other woodpeckers, such as the North American downy woodpecker (\\"Picoides\\" pubescens) and hairy woodpecker (\\"P.\\" villosus), the tropical American smoky-brown woodpecker (\\"P.\\" fumigatus) and certain Veniliornis species, or the striped woodpecker (V. lignarius) and checkered woodpecker (V. mixtus) and some South American Piculus and \\"Picoides\\". In all of these cases, these birds are neither gregarious nor known to be bad-tasting, and due to their size difference and habitat preferences do not compete much; hence the usual reasons for mimicry do not seem to apply. While the similar plumage may be due to sheer chance - perhaps as an atavism of plesiomorphic patterns - the facts that such cases are commonplace in the Picinae and that the species involved are usually sympatric suggests that there may well be some as yet undiscovered benefit to either or all of the taxa involved.Weibel & Moore (2005), Moore et al. (2006) Ecology This flameback is a species associated with a diversity of rather open forest habitat, such as found in the foothills of the Himalayas or in the Western Ghats; it also inhabits mangrove forest. It seems to be well-adapted to particular forest types, while the similar-looking common flameback (Dinopium javanense) is more of a generalist; thus, depending on what forests predominate in a region, C. lucidus may be more (e.g. in Thailand) or less common (e.g. in peninsular Malaysia) than D. javanense. In Malaysian mangrove forest for example, the greater flameback has been found to prefer tall Avicennia alba for foraging, while the common flameback rather indiscriminately utilizes that species as well as Bruguiera parviflora and Sonneratia alba. Like other woodpeckers, the greater flameback uses its bill to dig out food from trees and its zygodactyl feet and stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks. The long tongue can be darted forward to extract wood-boring arthropod prey; while mainly feeding on small invertebrates, greater flamebacks will also drink nectar. They nest in tree holes, laying three or four white eggs.Grimmett et al. (1999) Widely distributed and quite common in parts of its range, the Greater Flameback is classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.

The diameter of the asteroid is only about . It revolves about the Sun on an almost circular orbit very similar to that of the Earth. This lies for the most part inside the Earth's orbit, which it crosses near the asteroid's furthest point from the Sun, the aphelion. Because of this orbit, the asteroid is classified as Aten type, named after the asteroid 2062 Aten. A further characteristic is that its mean orbital period about the Sun is exactly one sidereal year. This means that it is locked into a relationship with the Earth, since such an orbit is only stable under particular conditions. As yet only a few asteroids of this sort are known, locked into a 1:1 resonance with the Earth. The first was 3753 Cruithne, discovered in 1986. Asteroids that have a 1:1 orbital resonance with a planet are also called co- orbital objects, because they follow the orbit of the planet. The most numerous known co-orbital asteroids are the so-called trojans, which occupy the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points of the relevant planet. However, does not belong to these. Instead, it follows a so-called horseshoe orbit along the path of the Earth.  Orbit  = Orbital data = Shortly after the discovery by LINEAR, Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Athabasca University (Canada), the Queen's University in Kingston (Ontario, Canada), the York University in Toronto and the Tuorla Observatory of the University of Turku in Finland determined the unusual orbit of , and through further observations at the Canada‚ÄìFrance‚ÄìHawaii Telescope in Hawaii it was confirmed that: JPL * Its orbit lies for the most part inside Earth's orbit. The orbits of most asteroids lie in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Through orbital disturbances by the gas giant planets, mainly Jupiter and the Kirkwood gaps, and through the Yarkovsky effect (force due to asymmetrical absorption and emission of infra-red radiation) asteroids are diverted into the inner Solar System, where their orbits are further influenced by close approaches with the inner planets. has probably been brought in the same way from the outer Solar System into Earth's influence. However, it is also suggested that the asteroid has always been on a near- Earth orbit and thus that it or a precursor body was formed near Earth's orbit. In this case one possibility is that it could be a fragment from a collision of a middle-sized asteroid with Earth or the Moon.M. Connors, C. Veillet, R. Brasser, P. Wiegert, P. W. Chodas, S. Mikkola, K. Innanen: Horseshoe Asteroids and Quasi-satellites in Earth-like Orbits. in: 35th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, 15.‚Äì19. M√§rz 2004. League City Texas 2004, 3., Abstract Nr. 1565 (PDF). * Its mean orbital period is one sidereal year. After it was diverted into the inner Solar System ‚Äì or formed on a path near Earth's orbit ‚Äì the asteroid must have been moved into an orbit corresponding with Earth. In this orbit it was repeatedly pulled by Earth in such a way that its own orbital period became the same as that of Earth. In the current orbit, Earth thus holds the asteroid in synchronicity with its own orbit. JPL * The orbit of the asteroid is almost circular, with an eccentricity of 0.012 which is even lower than that of the Earth at 0.0167. The other near-Earth asteroids have on average a significantly higher eccentricity of 0.29. Also, all other asteroids in 1:1 resonance with Earth known before 2002 have very strongly elliptical orbits ‚Äì e.g. the eccentricity of (3753) Cruithne is 0.515. At the time of its discovery the orbit of was unique, because of which the asteroid is often called the first true co-orbital companion of Earth, since the paths of previously discovered asteroids are not very similar to Earth's orbit. The very low orbital eccentricity of is also an indication that it must always have been on a near-Earth orbit, or the Yarkovsky effect must have comparatively strongly caused it to spiral into the inner Solar System over billions of years, since as a rule asteroids which have been steered by planets have orbits with higher eccentricity. * The orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic (orbital plane of Earth) of is a moderate 10.739¬∞. Hence its orbit is slightly tilted compared with that of Earth. = Shape of the orbit = Horseshoe orbit of 2002 AA29. The graphic shows a full revolution of 95 years. The position of along the orbit is that of year 2003 (last nearest approach to Earth). Image: JPL If one looks at the orbit of from a point moving with the Earth around the Sun (the reference frame of the Earth‚ÄìSun system), it describes over the course of 95 years an arc of almost 360¬∞, which during the next 95 years it retraces in reverse. The shape of this arc is reminiscent of a horseshoe, from which comes the name \\"horseshoe orbit\\". As it moves along the Earth's orbit, it winds in a spiral about it, in which each loop of the spiral takes one year. This spiral motion (in the Earth‚ÄìSun reference frame) arises from the slightly lower eccentricity and the tilt of the orbit: the inclination relative to the Earth's orbit is responsible for the vertical component of the spiral loop, and the difference in eccentricity for the horizontal component. When is approaching the Earth from in front (i.e. it is moving slightly slower, and the Earth is catching it up), the gravitational attraction of the Earth shifts it onto a slightly faster orbit, a little nearer the Sun. It now hurries ahead of the Earth along its new orbit, until after 95 years it has almost lapped the Earth and is coming up from behind. Again it comes under the Earth's gravitational influence; this time it is lifted onto a slower orbit, further from the Sun. On this orbit it can no longer keep pace with the Earth, and it falls behind until in 95 years it is once again approaching the Earth from in front. The Earth and chase each other in turn around the Sun, but do not get close enough to break the pattern. On 8 January 2003, the asteroid approached the Earth from in front to a distance of , its closest approach for nearly a century. Since that date, it has been hurrying ahead (with a semi-major axis less than 1 AU), and will continue to do so until it has reached its closest approach from behind on 11 July 2097 at a distance of . As a result of this subtle exchange with the Earth, unlike other Earth orbit crossing asteroids, we need have no fear that it could ever collide with the Earth. Calculations indicate that in the next few thousand years it will never come closer than 4.5 million kilometres, or about twelve times the distance from the Earth to the Moon. Quasi-satellite orbit of in the year 2589, looking vertically down on the ecliptic. Left, orbits of Asteroid and Earth in the reference frame of the fixed stars; right, in the reference frame of the Earth‚ÄìSun system. Image: JPL Because of its orbital inclination of 10.739¬∞ to the ecliptic, is not always forced by the Earth on its horseshoe orbit however but can sometimes slip out of this pattern. It is then caught for a while in the neighbourhood of the Earth. This will next happen in about 600 years i.e. in the 26th century. It will then stay within the small gap in the Earth's orbit which it does not reach in its previous horseshoe orbit, and will be no further than 0.2 astronomical units (30 million km) away from the Earth. There it will slowly circle the Earth almost like a second moon, although it takes one year for a circuit. After 45 years it finally switches back into the horseshoe orbit, until it again stays near the Earth for 45 years around the year 3750 and again in 6400. In these phases in which it stays outside its horseshoe orbit it oscillates in the narrow region along the Earth's orbit where it is caught, moving back and forth in 15 years. Because it is not bound to the Earth like the Moon but is mainly under the gravitational influence of the Sun, it belongs to the bodies called quasi-satellites. This is somewhat analogous to two cars travelling side by side at the same speed and repeatedly overtaking one another but which are however not attached to each other. Orbital calculations show that was in this quasi-satellite orbit for 45 years from about 520 AD but because of its tiny size was too dim to have been seen. It switches approximately cyclically between the two orbital forms, but always stays for 45 years in the quasi-satellite orbit. Outside the time frame from about 520-6500 AD, the calculated orbits become chaotic i.e. not predictable, and thus for periods outside this time frame no exact statements can be made.R. Brasser, K.

Because of its nearness to the Sun, it cannot however consist of volatile substances such as water ice, since these would evaporate or sublime; one can clearly observe this happening to a comet as this forms the visible tail. Presumably it will have a dark, carbon-bearing or somewhat lighter silicate-rich surface; in the former case the albedo would be around 0.05, in the latter somewhat higher at 0.15 to 0.25. It is due to this uncertainty that the figures for its diameter cover such a wide range. A further uncertainty arises from radar echo measurements at the Arecibo Radio Telescope, which could only pick up an unexpectedly weak radar echo, implying that is either smaller than estimated or reflects radio waves only weakly. In the former case it would have to have an unusually high albedo.Steven J. Ostro, Jon D. Giorgini, Lance A. M. Benner, Alice A. Hine, Michael C. Nolan, Jean-Luc Margot, Paul W. Chodas, Christian Veillet: Radar detection of Asteroid 2002 AA29 in: Icarus. Elsevier, San Diego 166.2003, 12, p271‚Äì275. (online on the Icarus Server: ) This would be evidence in support of the speculation that it, or at least the material of which it is composed, is different from most other asteroids so far discovered on near- Earth orbits, or represents a fragment thrown off by the collision of a medium-sized asteroid with the Earth or the Moon. = Rotational period = Using radar echo measurements at the Arecibo radio telescope the rotational period of could be determined. In this radar astronomy procedure radio waves of known wavelength are emitted from a radio telescope aimed at an asteroid. There they are reflected, and because of the Doppler effect the part of the surface that is moving towards the observer (because of the asteroid's rotation) shortens the wavelength of the reflected waves, whilst the other part which is turning away from the observer lengthens the reflected wavelength. As a result, the wavelength of the reflected waves is \\"smeared out\\". The extent of the wavelength smearing and the diameter of the asteroid allow the rotational period to be narrowed down. 33 minutes is thus calculated as the upper limit of the rotational period for ; it probably rotates more quickly. This rapid rotation together with the small diameter and therefore low mass leads to some interesting conclusions: * The asteroid rotates so quickly that the centrifugal force on its surface exceeds its gravitational pull. It is therefore under tension and so cannot be composed of an agglomeration of loosely bound debris or of fragments circling each other ‚Äì as is supposed for several other asteroids and for example has been determined for the asteroid (69230) Hermes. Instead the body must be made of a single relatively strong block of rock or of pieces baked together. However, its tensile strength is probably considerably lower than terrestrial rock and the asteroid also very porous. * cannot possibly have been built up from individual small pieces, as these would be thrown apart by the rapid rotation. Therefore, it must be a fragment blown off in the collision of two heavenly bodies. J. Richard Gott and Edward Belbruno from Princeton University have speculated that might have formed together with Earth and Theia, the postulated planet that, according to the giant impact hypothesis, collided with Earth in its early history.  Outlook  Because its orbit is very similar to the Earth's, the asteroid is relatively easily reachable by space probes. would therefore be a suitable object of study for more precise research into the structure and formation of asteroids and the evolution of their orbits around the Sun. Meanwhile, further co-orbital companions of the Earth of this type on horseshoe orbits or on orbits as quasi-satellites have already been found, such as the quasi-satellite . Furthermore, it is assumed that there are small trojan companions of the Earth with diameters in the region of 100 metres located at the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points of the Earth‚ÄìSun system.

Background Westmorland was the son of John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland, and Augusta, daughter of Lord Montague Bertie. He succeeded in the earldom on the death of his father in 1774.thepeerage.com John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland Political career In 1789 Westmorland was appointed Joint Postmaster General by William Pitt the Younger and sworn of the Privy Council. Already the same year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Pitt, a post he held until 1794. On 18 February 1793, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire. From 1795 to 1798 he was Master of the Horse under Pitt. The latter year Pitt made him Lord Privy Seal, a position he would hold under five prime Ministers (Pitt, Addington, Pitt again, Portland, Perceval and Liverpool) for the next 35 years, except between 1806 and 1807 when Lord Grenville was in office. Westmorland raised a Northamptonshire volunteer cavalry regiment in 1797, and was appointed its colonel on 20 April 1797. He was later Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire between 1828 and 1841. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1793. Family George Romney of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, 1796. Lord Westmorland married Sarah Anne Child (28 August 1764 ‚Äì 9 November 1793), the only daughter and heiress of wealthy banker, Robert Child, against her father's wishes, at Gretna Green on 20 May 1782. Child consequently cut his daughter and her sons and their descendants out of his will, and made his daughter's daughters his heirs to prevent the Fanes from benefitting from this elopement. Their eldest daughter, Lady Sarah Sophia Fane (1785‚Äì1867), having thus been made testamentary heiress of her maternal grandfather, married George Child-Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, her husband assuming the additional surname of Child. The Earl and Countess of Westmorland had one son and four daughters: *John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland (3 February 1784 ‚Äì 16 October 1859), who succeeded his father. *Lady Sarah Sophia Fane (4 March 1785 ‚Äì 26 January 1867) who married in 1804 George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey and became heiress to the Child fortune. *Lady Augusta Fane (1786‚Äì1871), who married firstly in 1804 (divorced 1809) Lord Boringdon, later Earl of Morley (by whom she was the mother of Henry Villiers Parker), and in 1809 Arthur Paget (1771‚Äì1840), a younger brother of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. *Lady Maria Fane (1787‚Äì1834) who in 1805 married Viscount Duncannon, later 4th Earl of Bessborough; their sixth son Spencer Ponsonby-Fane inherited Brympton d'Evercy from his half-aunt Lady Georgiana. *Lady Charlotte Fane (1793‚Äì1822), died unmarried. The Countess of Westmorland died relatively young in 1793, aged only 29, from undisclosed causes. Lord Westmorland married secondly Jane, daughter of Richard Huck-Saunders, in 1800. After some years of marriage, they later separated and she lived at Brympton d'Evercy. By his second wife, he had three sons and two daughters, of whom only the eldest child Lady Georgiana Fane outlived both parents and inherited the Brympton estate. *Lady (Cicely Jane) Georgina Fane (25 January 1801 ‚Äì 1875), died unmarried, leaving Brympton d'Evercy to her nephew Spencer Ponsonby-Fane *Hon.

It is one of James's most popular long novels and is regarded by critics as one of his finest. The Portrait of a Lady is the story of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who, \\"confronting her destiny\\", finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates. Like many of James's novels, it is set in Europe, mostly England and Italy. Generally regarded as the masterpiece of James's early period, this novel reflects James's continuing interest in the differences between the New World and the Old, often to the detriment of the former. It also treats in a profound way the themes of personal freedom, responsibility, and betrayal. Plot summary Isabel Archer, from Albany, New York, is invited by her maternal aunt, Lydia Touchett, to visit Lydia's rich husband, Daniel, at his estate near London, following the death of Isabel's father. There, Isabel meets her uncle, her friendly invalid cousin Ralph Touchett, and the Touchetts' robust neighbor, Lord Warburton. Isabel later declines Warburton's sudden proposal of marriage. She also rejects the hand of Caspar Goodwood, the charismatic son and heir of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Although Isabel is drawn to Caspar, her commitment to her independence precludes such a marriage, which she feels would demand the sacrifice of her freedom. The elder Touchett grows ill and, at the request of his son, Ralph, leaves much of his estate to Isabel upon his death. With her large legacy, Isabel travels the Continent and meets an American expatriate, Gilbert Osmond, in Florence. Although Isabel had previously rejected both Warburton and Goodwood, she accepts Osmond's proposal of marriage, unaware that it has been actively promoted by the accomplished but untrustworthy Madame Merle, another American expatriate, whom Isabel had met at the Touchetts' estate. Isabel and Osmond settle in Rome, but their marriage rapidly sours due to Osmond's overwhelming egotism and lack of genuine affection for his wife. Isabel grows fond of Pansy, Osmond's presumed daughter by his first marriage, and wants to grant her wish to marry Edward Rosier, a young art collector. The snobbish Osmond would prefer that Pansy accept the proposal of Warburton, who had previously proposed to Isabel. Isabel suspects, however, that Warburton may just be feigning interest in Pansy to get close to Isabel again, and the conflict creates even more strain within the unhappy marriage. Isabel then learns that Ralph is dying at his estate in England and prepares to go to him for his final hours, but Osmond selfishly opposes this plan. Meanwhile, Isabel learns from her sister-in-law that Pansy is actually the daughter of Madame Merle, who had had an adulterous relationship with Osmond for several years. Isabel pays a final visit to Pansy, who desperately begs her to return someday, which Isabel reluctantly promises to do. She then leaves, without telling her spiteful husband, to comfort the dying Ralph in England, where she remains until his death. Goodwood encounters her at Ralph's estate and begs her to leave Osmond and come away with him. He passionately embraces and kisses her, but Isabel flees. Goodwood seeks her out the next day but is told she has set off again for Rome. The ending is ambiguous, and the reader is left to imagine whether Isabel returned to Osmond to suffer out her marriage in noble tragedy (perhaps for Pansy's sake), or she is going to rescue Pansy and leave Osmond. Major themes James's first idea for The Portrait of a Lady was simple: a young American woman confronting her destiny, whatever it might be. Only then did he begin to form a plot to bring out the character of his central figure. This was the uncompromising story of the free-spirited Isabel losing her freedom‚Äîdespite (or because of) suddenly coming into a great deal of money‚Äîand getting \\"ground in the very mill of the conventional\\". Literary significance and criticism The Portrait of a Lady has received critical acclaim since its first publication in The Atlantic Monthly, and it remains the most popular of James's longer fictions. Contemporary critics recognise that James had pushed the analysis of human consciousness and motivation to new levels, particularly in such passages as the famous Chapter 42, where Isabel meditates deep into the night about her marriage and the trap she seems to have fallen into. James made an in-depth account of Isabel's deepest terrors in his preface to the 1908 New York Edition of the novel. More recent criticism has been levied by feminists. In particular, Isabel's final return to Osmond has fascinated critics, who have debated whether James sufficiently justifies this seemingly paradoxical rejection of freedom. One interpretation is: Isabel both feels as honour-bound to the promise she has made to stepdaughter Pansy as she does to her marriage to Osmond, and she believes that the scene her \\"unacceptable\\" trip to England will create with Osmond will leave her in a more justifiable position to abandon her dreadful marriage. The extensive revisions James made for the 1908 New York Edition generally have been accepted as improvements, unlike the changes he made to other texts, such as The American or Roderick Hudson. The revision of the final scene between Isabel and Goodwood has been especially applauded. As Edward Wagenknecht noted, James \\"makes it as clear as any modern novelist could make it by using all the four-letter words in the dictionary that [Isabel] has been roused as never before in her life, roused in the true sense perhaps for the first time in her life.\\" James's verbal magic allowed him to both obey and evade the restrictive conventions of his day for the treatment of sexuality in literature. Critic Alfred Habegger has written that the main character of Portrait was inspired by Christie Archer, the protagonist from Anne Moncure Crane's novel Reginald Archer (1871). Crane (1838‚Äì1872) may have influenced James, who Habegger considers was interested in Crane's female characters. In the preface to the 1908 New York Edition of the novel, James referred to several of George Eliot's female protagonists as possible influences on this novel. Habegger questions this and quotes others as doing the same. In another critical article, \\"Rewriting Misogyny: The Portrait of a Lady and the Popular Fiction Debate\\", Paul M. Hadella mentions the similarities with Crane. Adaptations for stage and screen In 1884, when the actor Lawrence Barrett wanted James to turn the novel into a play, James replied that he did not think it could be done.James, Henry; Edel, Leon (ed.) (1980). Letters, Volume III: 1883‚Äì1895, pp. 46‚Äì47. Belknap Press. In his opinion, given in the preface to the New York Edition, the best scene in the book consists of Isabel sitting motionless in a chair.James, Henry (2009). Preface, p. 19. The story was adapted as a Broadway play by William Archibald, which opened in December 1954, with Barbara O'Neil in the role of Madame Serena Merle.Portrait of a Lady at IDBD.

The film follows the crew of a Soviet T-55 tank who became lost during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The film has enjoyed a cult- favorite status in spite of its low box office statistics. Plot In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks‚Äîcommanded by ruthless commander Daskal (George Dzundza)‚Äîtakes a wrong turn through a mountain pass and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed, and his brother martyred by being crushed under Daskal's tank. As the new khan following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin Moustafa, an opportunistic scavenger. Together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue Daskal's tank (which they call \\"The Beast\\"), counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. Lost, isolated, and with their radio damaged in the village attack, the tank crew set out to find Kandahar Road and return to Soviet lines. While camping for the night, Afghan communist crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the reluctant tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the Pashtun people's code of honour, Pashtunwali; particularly nanawatai, which requires that an enemy is to be given sanctuary if he asks. En route, the crew suffer several setbacks and ambushes from Taj's band. Suspecting Samad to be a traitor, Daskal murders him in front of his men; Koverchenko threatens to report Daskal for the illegal killing. At a brief stop, Koverchenko reports that their tank is breaking down; Daskal accuses him of mutiny and orders gunner Kaminski (Don Harvey) and driver Golikov (Stephen Baldwin) to tie him to a rock, and leave him with a grenade behind his head as a booby-trap for the mujahideen. Wild dogs eventually attack Koverchenko, but he is saved when the grenade rolls off the rock and explodes, scaring them off. Taj's band reunite with several vengeful women from the village and find Koverchenko, who pleads for nanawatai. The mujahideen give him food and shelter. Koverchenko befriends Taj after fixing the band's broken RPG-7, and agrees to help him destroy the tank. The remaining tank crew realize they are trapped in the valley, until a Soviet helicopter (searching for water) appears and offers to rescue them. Caring more for his tank than his men, Daskal refuses the offer, has the vehicle's gasoline refilled, and the crew heads back towards the narrow mountain pass from which they came, which the helicopter pilot says is the only way out. They drive through the night, and eventually return to a water hole they had poisoned earlier with cyanide to try and kill Taj's band; there they find the helicopter crew dead, having drunk from the same pool. The mujahideen and Koverchenko catch up with the tank, and pursue it through the mountain pass. Koverchenko finally fires the RPG after a tense chase, only to damage the tank's main gun. Just as it seems the tank will escape, the village women (armed with explosives) blow up the cliff-side, dropping boulders onto the tank and disabling it. Koverchenko sets fire to the tank's leaked gasoline, forcing the crew to bail; he pleads nanawatai on their behalf, and Taj reluctantly agrees. Koverchenko confronts Daskal over his brutality, and desires that he live to see the Soviets lose the war. Kaminski and Golikov flee on foot, but Daskal is chased down by the village women and murdered; they bring back his bloodied uniform to Taj as trophies. Horrified, Koverchenko waves down an arriving Soviet helicopter to be rescued. Taj stops Moustafa from shooting Koverchenko, who salutes Taj as he is hoisted by a harness, brandishing a jezail musket Taj had just gifted to him. The film ends with Koverchenko flying off with the helicopter over the Afghan landscape. Cast * George Dzundza as Commander \\"Tank Boy\\" Daskal * Jason Patric as Konstantin Koverchenko * Steven Bauer as Khan Taj * Erick Avari as Samad * Stephen Baldwin as Golikov * Donald Patrick Harvey as Kaminski * Kabir Bedi as Akbar Production The film was shot in Israel. Several actual T-55 tanks were used in the film; however, the helicopter used in the film was not a real Mi-8, but an Aerospatiale SA.321 Super Frelon. The tank in question in the movie is actually an Israeli modification of a Soviet T-55 captured by the Israelis from the Arab armies, redesignated as the Ti-67 and fitted with a 105mm main gun in place of the original 100mm gun, leading some to mistake it for a T-62. Many of these conversions were used by the Israelis during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The film's military advisor, Dale Dye, has written that he negotiated the purchase of the tanks over drinks with Israel Defense Forces officers in a Tel Aviv hotel. The language spoken by the Afghan characters is Pashto. The Pashto dialogue is subtitled but some television screenings have omitted the subtitles. Soundtrack The original soundtrack music was released by CBS/Columbia Records shortly after the movie's debut, written and performed entirely by Mark Isham. The back of the album suggests two tracks (\\"Badal\\" and \\"Nanawatai\\"), but there are, in fact, ten. Offered in 12-inch LP vinyl, CrO2 cassette and DDD-format compact discs. Used CD copies command rather high prices since limited numbers were released in spite of composer Mark Isham's celebrity status. In addition to the soundtrack, the song –¢—Ä–æ–ª–ª–µ–π–±—É—Å (\\"Trolleybus\\") by the Russian rock band Kino is heard playing on the radio during a scene. However, –¢—Ä–æ–ª–ª–µ–π–±—É—Å was not released until 1983, 2 years after the events portrayed in the movie. The song was titled Streetcar Headed East in English-speaking countries.

The white-naped woodpecker (Chrysocolaptes festivus) is a woodpecker which is a widespread but scarce breeder in the Indian Subcontinent. This flameback is a species associated with open forest and scrub with some trees. It nests in a tree hole, laying one or two white eggs. Taxonomy The white-naped woodpecker was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Goa, on the southwest coast of India. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Picus festivus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The white-naped woodpecker is now placed in the genus Chrysocolaptes that was introduced by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1843. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek khrusos meaning \\"gold\\" and kolaptƒìs meaning \\"chiseller\\". The specific epithet festivus is Latin for \\"festive\\" or \\"cheerful\\". Two subspecies are recognised: * C. f. festivus (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì central and south India * C. f. tantus Ripley, 1946 ‚Äì Sri Lanka Description The white-naped woodpecker is a large species at in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape. The white hind neck extends down the back, and the black shoulder patches also continue onto the back to form a V-shape bordering the white. The rest of the upperparts and wings are golden yellow. The rump and tail are black, and the underparts are white with dark chevron markings. The head is whitish with a dark moustache stripe and a black eye patch that extends down the neck sides. Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or \\"yoked\\" feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can dart forward to capture insects. The adult male white-naped woodpecker has a red crown and females have a yellow crown. Young birds are colored like the female, but duller.

It originates as an Old High German short form (variants Audo, Odo, Udo) of Germanic names beginning in aud-, an element meaning \\"wealth, prosperity\\".F√∂rstemann, Altdeutsches Namenbuch (1856), s.v. \\"Aud\\" (161-180). F√∂rstemann calls the element \\"excessively frequent\\" (Ein unendlich h√§ufiger wortstamm). Spelling variants listed for the short form are: Audo, Auto, Oudo, Outo, Outho, Aoto, Aotto, Oato, Odo, Odda, Oddo, Oto, Otto (8th century), Otho, Ottho, Odto, Hodo, Hoto, Hotto, Hottho, Ootto, Ocdo, and Octto. The surviving signatures of the Ottoian kings mostly read Otto, sometimes Odo or Oto. Listed as variants surviving into Modern High German are: Hoth, Hotho, Oette, Ott, Otte, Otto, and Otho. The similarity of the Roman cognomen Otho is entirely coincidental. The spelling Otto is first recorded s.a. 744 in the charters of the Diocese of Constance (ed. Neugart, codex diplomaticus Alamanniae, 1791) and becomes increasingly common in the High Medieval period. The name is recorded from the 7th century (Odo, son of Uro, courtier of Sigebert III). It was the name of three 10th-century German kings, the first of whom was Otto I the Great, the first Holy Roman Emperor, founder of the Ottonian dynasty. The Gothic form of the prefix was auda- (as in e.g. Auda√æius), the Anglo-Saxon form was ead- (as in e.g. Eadmund), the Old Norse form was au√∞-. The given name Otis arose from an English surname, which was in turn derived from Ode, a variant form of Odo, Otto. Due to Otto von Bismarck, the given name Otto was strongly associated with the German Empire in the later 19th century. It was comparatively frequently given in the United States (presumably in German American families) during the 1880s to 1890s, remaining in the top 100 most popular masculine given names in the US throughout 1880-1898, but its popularity decreased significantly after 1900 with increasing anti-German sentiment leading up to World War I; it fell below rank 200 in 1919, below rank 500 in 1947, and below rank 1000 in 1975; it re-entered the top-1000 most popular given names in the US only in the 2010s, ranking 696th as of 2013.US statistics (behindthename.com).

The first of them is named Dindrane, the second is usually unnamed and known today as the Grail heroine. Dindrane Dindrane (or Dandrane, Danbrann, Dandrenor, Dindraine, etc.) is a character in the Old French romance Perlesvaus, or The High Book of the Holy Grail, an anonymous prose adaptation of (and sequel to) Chr√©tien de Troyes' unfinished poem Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A sister of King Arthur's knight Percival, who rescues her from an evil bride kidnapper, Dandrane lives out her days as a maiden in the Grail Castle, together with her mother (Yglais, herself a sister of King Pelles and widow of Alain \\"the Large\\", lord of the valley and castle of Kamaalot) and brother (Percival). The pre-cyclic version of the Prose Lancelot names her Heliabel, describing her as even more beautiful than Guinevere. Grail heroine How Sir Galahad, Sir Bors and Sir Percival were Fed with the Sanc Grael; But Sir Percival's Sister Died by the Way by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1864) Contrary to popular notion, Dandrane in the 13th-century Perlesvaus is not the sister of Percival who dies helping him (with Galahad and Bors) achieve the Holy Grail. This distinct latter character appears, unnamed, in the Vulgate Queste del Saint Graal (Quest for the Holy Grail) and its successors‚Äîand in the same context as Agresizia in the 14th-century Italian Tavola Ritonda. Though frequently left unnamed, Perceval's sister is a prominent figure in many of the Grail romances, sometimes dubbed the \\"Grail heroine\\". According to Anna Caughey, Thomas Malory's portrayal of Percival's sister in his 15th-century Le Morte d'Arthur characterizes her with an unusual \\"seizure of power and agency for a Malorian [good] woman that has previously been seen only in ambivalent or actively evil figures such as Nynyve or Morgan le Fay.\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=hcPtirDJv9wC&pg;=PA168 She is first encountered upon her brother (sometimes half-brother)'s return to their mother's castle, where she tells him that their mother has died. Percival leaves her either in the care of their hermit uncle or (in other texts) at the Castle of Maidens. She later meets up with Percival, Galahad and Bors, telling them who she is (she does not mention her name prior to this). She proceeds to inform them of the Sword of the Strange Belt, the magical Ship of Solomon, the Tree of Life, and other aspects of her destiny. The travellers board the Ship of Solomon, intent to complete the mystical Grail quest. After leaving the ship, they encounter a castle with a leprous mistress; told that only the blood of a maiden princess can cure the chatelaine's leprosy, Percival's sister opts to donate hers, but succumbs to the blood loss and dies. As per her dying wish, the damsel's body is set adrift in a boat (without a crew) to float to the holy city of Sarras. In some versions, Lancelot (Galahad's father) finds her vessel and buries her in Palais Esperitel; in others, she is interred by Galahad and Bors when they land at the port of Sarras (after which they proceed to win the Grail).

Chief Fong was quoted as saying that she was too busy to recertify. When the controversy erupted in the local media, she was recertified a week later. =Leadership= Fong was criticized for supporting Mayor Gavin Newsom in his conflict with police officer Andrew Cohen and 21 other officers who made a controversial \\"comedy\\" videotape for a police Christmas party. This tape was deemed racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti-Asian by the mayor, but the officers pointed out that they were making fun of themselves and that the tape was meant only for their own private Christmas party. Fong was criticized for supporting the mayor in this dispute rather than the men and women under her command.

He was the father of Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool. Early years, family and education He was born in Oxfordshire, the eldest son of Colonel Charles Jenkinson (1693‚Äì1750) and Amarantha (daughter of Wolfran Cornewall). The earl was the grandson of Sir Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Baronet, of Walcot, Oxfordshire. The Jenkinson family was descended from Anthony Jenkinson (died 1611), who was a sea-captain, merchant, and traveller and the first known Englishman to penetrate into Central Asia. Liverpool was educated at Charterhouse School and University College, Oxford, where he graduated Master of Arts in 1752. Political career In 1761, Liverpool entered parliament as member for Cockermouth and was made Under-Secretary of State by Lord Bute. He won the favour of George III, and when Bute retired Jenkinson became the leader of the \\"King's Friends\\" in the House of Commons. In 1763, George Grenville appointed him joint Secretary to the Treasury. In 1766,after a short retirement, he became a Lord of the Admiralty and then a Lord of the Treasury in the Grafton administration. In 1772, Jenkinson became a Privy Councillor and Vice Treasurer of Ireland, and in 1775 he purchased the lucrative sinecure of Clerk of the Pells in Ireland and became Master of the Mint of Ireland. From 1778 until the close of Lord North's ministry in 1782 he was Secretary at War. From 1786 to 1804, he was President of the Board of Trade and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and he was popularly regarded as enjoying the confidence of the king to a special degree. Addiscombe Place, c. 1859 In 1786 he was created Baron Hawkesbury, of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, and ten years later, Earl of Liverpool. He also succeeded his cousin in 1790 as the 7th Baronet of Walcot and to the family estates. He lived at Addiscombe Place, Surrey and in Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire. He died in London on 17 December 1808. Family Liverpool was twice married. In 1769 he married firstly Amelia, daughter of William Watts, governor of Fort William, Bengal, and of his wife, better known as Begum Johnson. Amelia died in July 1770, a month after the birth of her only child, Robert. Liverpool married secondly Catherine, daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet, and widow of Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet, on 22 June 1782 at her house in Hertford Street, London. They had one son, Charles, who became 3rd Earl of Liverpool, and one daughter, Charlotte, who married James Grimston, 1st Earl of Verulam. On Lord Liverpool's death, he was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, Robert, who became a prominent politician and eventually Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The Countess of Liverpool died in October 1827, aged 82. Legacy Liverpool wrote several political works, but other than for his Treatise on the Coins of the Realm (1805) these are, according to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"without striking merits\\". The Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, Australia and Hawkesbury, Ontario, Canada were named after Jenkinson shortly after he was created Baron Hawkesbury. At least two ships were named after Jenkinson under his title of Lord Hawkesbury: one launched in America in 1781‚Äîpresumably under another name‚Äîbut entered in Lloyd's Register from 1787 as the Lord Hawkesbury, sailing as a whaler; and the East Indiaman Lord Hawkesbury, launched in 1787.

He is best known for hosting Double Dare for Nickelodeon, Unwrapped for Food Network, and recently he was Executive Producer for both Dinner: Impossible and Restaurant: Impossible also for Food Network.  Early career  Summers was born Marc Berkowitz in Indianapolis, Indiana. He attended Westlane Middle School and North Central High School in Indianapolis and Grahm Junior College in Boston, Massachusetts. His early careers were as a radio disc jockey and a stand-up comedian; though he held various television production jobs before Summers' career was boosted in 1986, when Nickelodeon hired him as the host of Double Dare. Double Dare was syndicated within two years and had a brief broadcast network run in prime time as Fox Family Double Dare in 1988. The show's popularity led to other hosting jobs including the syndicated Couch Potatoes in 1989, and Nickelodeon's What Would You Do? in 1991. GSN chose him to host its original program WinTuition in 2002. He also had a rare dramatic performance in the Nickelodeon-produced Halloween program Mystery Magical Special, which also highlighted his skills as a stage magician. Summers also made celebrity guest rounds on other game shows including Scrabble, Super Password, Talk About, Lingo, To Tell the Truth, Win, Lose or Draw, and Hollywood Squares. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Summers appeared on television talk shows, including a stint on ABC television's Home Show. After Double Dare's cancellation in 1993, Summers co- hosted Our Home, a daily talk show aimed at homemakers, on Lifetime. Summers left Our Home after a couple of seasons to co-host another Lifetime talk show, Biggers & Summers. On March 28, 2008, the Communication and Journalism Club of Coastal Carolina University presented Summers with the first annual Peach Cobbler Award and declared that day as \\"Marc Summers Day\\". The Peach Cobbler Award was modeled after Harvard's Hasty Pudding Award. The Peach Cobbler Award recognizes an individual and their accomplishments in the communication field. After the ceremony, Summers hosted a mock version of Double Dare on the university's campus.  Health  During an interview with Dr. Eric Hollander on Biggers & Summers, Summers revealed that he has obsessive compulsive disorder. Summers went public about his condition on various television shows, including The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Today Show. In 1999, Summers produced a VHS video box set with Hollander about his experience, called Everything in Its Place: My Trials and Triumphs with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Summers also participated in a series of VHS videos for Freedom from Fear, a non- profit organization with the goal of addressing anxiety disorders and other related behavioral disorders. Despite his OCD, he was able to interact fully with his fans and contestants on Double Dare to the point of even allowing himself to get slimed and shaking hands with contestants. Going public with his OCD cost Summers a job as host of a Hollywood Squares revival, and he was replaced by Tom Bergeron.\\"Whitney Houston's Sister-In-Law Pat Houston & Model Niki Taylor.\\" Oprah: Where Are They Now? Exec. Prod. Julie Simpson, Jill Van Lokeren, and Veronica Votypka. CEO/Chief Crea. Off. Oprah Winfrey. Oprah Winfrey Network. November 16, 2014. In August 2012, Summers suffered severe head injuries in an accident in a Philadelphia taxicab equipped with a partition. Summers said, \\"Everything on the left side [of my face] from my eye socket down was just wiped out. My eye socket got all swollen. I'm having trouble seeing completely out of the left eye ... There's lots of VCR parts in my face. I was pretty lucky that I didn't have brain damage.\\" In a 2015 interview on the Philadelphia-based \\"Preston and Steve\\" radio show (WMMR), Summers revealed that 6 years before, in 2009, he had \\"stomach problems\\" and had been in a lot of pain. Exploratory surgery revealed that he had chronic lymphatic leukemia. The initial doctor recommended chemotherapy, but fearing the pain and illness involved, Summers sought the opinion of another oncologist in Chicago. The oncologist promptly misdiagnosed him with mantle cell lymphoma and told him that he only had 6 months to live. Summers went back to his initial doctor in a panic; ultimately the original diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia was confirmed. Chemotherapy would go on for the next 2 years for him, which he described as \\"brutal\\". Summers has had PET scans ever since his chemo finished, and as of 2016, is in remission. On \\"Preston and Steve\\" on April 10, 2018, Summers discussed flying to the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center from his home in Santa Barbara for further treatment. In late 2019, Summers admitted that he is again battling with cancer. He did not specify which type of cancer but said he was taking medication and that \\"it's all going to be [fine]\\".  Later career  During the 1990s, Summers continued work on television shows, each with varying success. He created and hosted the short-lived children's game show Pick Your Brain, co-hosted Great Day America on the PAX Network, produced I Can't Believe You Said That, and hosted It's a Surprise on Food Network. In 1993, Summers hosted a special episode of Nova (American TV program), called ‚ÄúThe NOVA Quiz‚Äù, celebrating the show‚Äôs 20th anniversary season on PBS. Contestants answered science questions and participated in science experiments, for a chance to go on a science expedition. Summers returned to Nickelodeon in 2000 as the executive consultant for Double Dare 2000, an updated version of his original show. Two years later, he was the executive producer for another Nickelodeon resurrection, Wild and Crazy Kids. He returned to television as the host of more shows, including History IQ with his old announcer Harvey on the History Channel; the Food Network series Unwrapped; the Unwrapped spin-off game show, Trivia Unwrapped; and the Game Show Network series WinTuition. In 2005, Summers became the host of Food Network's reality series The Next Food Network Star. Summers joined Chef Guy Fieri as co-host of Food Network's Ultimate Recipe Showdown in 2008. In late 2006, Sony Pictures Television and KingWorld planned a new game show called Combination Lock, with Summers hosting the first pilot. It was to be paired with a revival of the classic game show, The Joker's Wild. However, a deal couldn't be reached by KingWorld and station groups. Off the screen, Summers has been involved as an executive producer on the Food Network's Dinner: Impossible and Restaurant: Impossible. Summers currently splits his time between homes in Los Angeles and Philadelphia where his company Marc Summers Productions has a branch. Summers has hosted stage versions of The Price Is Right and credits Bob Barker and The Price Is Right for helping him pursue a game-show career. Summers was a young page at CBS when The Price Is Right premiered with The Joker's Wild and Gambit in 1972, and he often asked advice of Barker, Jack Barry and Wink Martindale-- the shows' respective hosts--about a hosting career. He claims it's the best possible education and training in the game show field, and it was during this time that Summers got his first on-air experience, as a fill-in announcer on The Joker's Wild. Summers served as host of \\"Drunk Double Dare\\" during Drunk Day, an annual episode of the Philadelphia-based Preston and Steve radio show on WMMR, held directly before the Fourth of July weekend. The show reunited Summers with his Double Dare cohorts John Harvey and Robin Marrella. He has also hosted \\"Dunkel Dare\\" during the annual Beer Week in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Summers appears in the Good Charlotte music video for their song \\"Last Night\\", which uses Family Double Dare as the motif for the video. He has also played himself on The Cleveland Show, Robot Chicken, Workaholics, and Sanjay & Craig, and appeared in special segments on ABC's The Chew. He is the subject and executive producer of On Your Marc, a documentary that chronicles his life and development of his one-man theater show, featuring interviews with Neil Patrick Harris, Ryan Seacrest, Guy Fieri and Seth Green, and was directed by Mathew Klickstein. He hosted a number of early preview screenings and live events as part of a nationwide promotional tour of the film in October 2017. Summers returned to host a 30th Anniversary of Double Dare at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con International. Summers also appeared in a commemorative half-hour special in honor of the show's 30th anniversary that aired on Nickelodeon on November 23, 2016. In 2018, Summers provided color commentary along with his vast knowledge of the game on the revival of Double Dare with Liza Koshy, produced by RTL Group / FremantleMedia, and served as executive producer. In 2019, Summers hosted Double Dare Live, a non-broadcast, national touring version of the show. On July 20, 2020, Summers appears as himself on an episode in season four of Nickelodeon's The Loud House aired titled \\"How Double Dare You!\\" in which the Loud family siblings attempt to get on Double Dare.https://tvschedule.zap2it.com/overview.html?programSeriesId=SH02398955&tabName;=guide&season;=4 References  External links  On Your Marc *Marc Summers talks about the peaks and valleys of his long career 1951 births American male comedians American game show hosts Television producers from California American television talk show hosts American male voice actors Game show announcers Living people Male actors from Indianapolis People from Los Angeles Food Network Jewish comedians Jewish American writers Writers from California Writers from Indiana American male writers Comedians from California People with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder ","title":"Marc Summers"},{"id":"603590","text":"Charles Shaw-Lefevre may refer to: * Charles Shaw Lefevre (politician) (1759‚Äì1823), born Charles Shaw, British Whig politician * Charles Shaw- Lefevre, 1st Viscount Eversley (1794‚Äì1888), his son, Speaker of the House of Commons ","title":"Charles Shaw-Lefevre"},{"id":"603595","text":"Max the Mighty is a young adult novel by Rodman Philbrick.

Frank then tries to turn them in, and Max and Worm have to leave the Prairie Schooner. To take them the rest of the way they hop a train with Hobo Joe and arrive in Chivalry, Montana in a different train. They go into a mining tunnel and Max discovers that Worm's birth father had died in a mining accident. The Undertaker arrives there with the police and Max and Worm run away in the tunnels. They meet Dip, and Max's grandfather, Grim. The police catch them, and Worm runs back into the tunnel. She thinks about committing suicide to be with her father and away from her stepfather, but Max talks her out of it. A support beam in the mine falls over, pinning the Undertaker to the ground. This prompts Worm to finally confront the Undertaker about all the abuse he has been doing to her and her mother, revealing the truth to the police. Before anything else can happen, the mine starts to collapse, forcing everybody to run for the exit. However, Max cannot bear to leave the Undertaker behind, even after everything he's done, so he lifts up the beam to free the Undertaker. The Undertaker gets out of the mine in time, but Max couldn't. Fortunately, emergency services manages to rescue Max, who winds up with a broken shoulder and a broken leg as a result. Afterwards, Worm's mother finally works up the courage to stand up to her abusive husband and testify about what really happened, getting the Undertaker convicted of domestic abuse and locked up in prison for a long time. The book ends with Max and his grandparents insisting that Worm and her mother live with them, which they gladly do. Max frequently mentions his old friend Kevin, also nicknamed Freak, throughout the book.

The role of trustee must be taken at a different time than that of executor, as the position of trustee precludes administration in trust law. Especially when dealing with large and lucrative estates this position generally does not exist in many cases so as not to create a conflict of interest. The remedy is usually to have an executor act in an arbitrary fashion and have no financial interest in how the estate will be divided up. This can be problematic, given that in some countries, such as the United States, an executor is automatically entitled to compensation for his or her services.Executor Compensation, Reimbursement, and Fees See also: trust law, inheritance, executor, trustee, wiktionary definition References Legal professions ","title":"Executorial trustee"},{"id":"603599","text":"The Critique of Practical Reason () is the second of Immanuel Kant's three critiques, published in 1788. It follows on from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and deals with his moral philosophy. The second Critique exercised a decisive influence over the subsequent development of the field of ethics and moral philosophy, beginning with Johann Gottlieb Fichte's Doctrine of Science and becoming, during the 20th century, the principal reference point for deontological moral philosophy. Preface and introduction Kant sketches out here what is to follow. Most of these two chapters focus on comparing the situation of theoretical and of practical reason and therefore discusses how the Critique of Practical Reason compares to the Critique of Pure Reason. The first Critique, \\"of Pure Reason\\", was a criticism of the pretensions of those who use pure theoretical reason, who claim to attain metaphysical truths beyond the ken of applied reasoning. The conclusion was that pure theoretical reason must be restrained, because it produces confused arguments when applied outside of its appropriate sphere. However, the Critique of Practical Reason is not a critique of pure practical reason, but rather a defense of it as being capable of grounding behavior superior to that grounded by desire-based practical reasoning. It is actually a critique, then, of the pretensions of applied practical reason. Pure practical reason must not be restrained, in fact, but cultivated. Kant informs us that while the first Critique suggested that God, freedom, and immortality are unknowable, the second Critique will mitigate this claim. Freedom is indeed knowable because it is revealed by God. God and immortality are also knowable, but practical reason now requires belief in these postulates of reason. Kant once again invites his dissatisfied critics to actually provide a proof of God's existence and shows that this is impossible because the various arguments (ontological, cosmological and teleological) for God's existence all depend essentially on the idea that existence is a predicate inherent to the concepts to which it is applied. Kant insists that the Critique can stand alone from the earlier Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, although it addresses some criticisms leveled at that work. This work will proceed at a higher level of abstraction. While valid criticisms of the Groundwork are to be addressed, Kant dismisses many criticisms that he finds unhelpful. He suggests that many of the defects that reviewers have found in his arguments are in fact only in their brains, which are too lazy to grasp his ethical system as a whole. As to those who accuse him of writing incomprehensible jargon, he challenges them to find more suitable language for his ideas or to prove that they are really meaningless. He reassures the reader that the second Critique will be more accessible than the first. Finally, the sketch of the second Critique is presented in the Introduction. It is modeled on the first Critique: the Analytic will investigate the operations of the faculty in question; the Dialectic will investigate how this faculty can be led astray; and the Doctrine of Method will discuss the questions of moral education. Analytic: Chapter One Practical reason is the faculty for determining the will, which operates by applying a general principle of action to one's particular situation. For Kant, a principle can be either a mere maxim if it is based on the agent's desires or a law if it applies universally. Any principle that presupposes a previous desire for some object in the agent always presupposes that the agent is the sort of person who would be interested in that particular object. Anything that an agent is interested in can only be contingent, however, and never necessary. Therefore, it cannot be a law. To say, for example, that the law is to serve God means that the law is dependent on interest in God. This cannot be the basis for any universal moral law. To say that the law is to seek the greatest happiness of the greatest number or the greatest good, always presupposes some interest in the greatest happiness, the greatest number, the greatest good, and so on. Kant concludes that the source of the nomological character of the moral law must derive not from its content but from its form alone. The content of the universal moral law, the categorical imperative, must be nothing over and above the law's form, otherwise it will be dependent on the desires that the law's possessor has. The only law whose content consists in its form, according to Kant, is the statement: Kant then argues that a will which acts on the practical law is a will which is acting on the idea of the form of law, an idea of reason which has nothing to do with the senses. Hence the moral will is independent of the world of the senses, the world where it might be constrained by one's contingent desires. The will is therefore fundamentally free. The converse also applies: if the will is free, then it must be governed by a rule, but a rule whose content does not restrict the freedom of the will. The only appropriate rule is the rule whose content is equivalent to its form, the categorical imperative. To follow the practical law is to be autonomous, whereas to follow any of the other types of contingent laws (or hypothetical imperatives) is to be heteronomous and therefore unfree. The moral law expresses the positive content of freedom, while being free from influence expresses its negative content. Furthermore, we are conscious of the operation of the moral law on us and it is through this consciousness that we are conscious of our freedom and not through any kind of special faculty. Though our actions are normally determined by the calculations of \\"self-love\\", we realize that we can ignore self-love's urgings when moral duty is at stake. Consciousness of the moral law is a priori and unanalysable. Kant ends this chapter by discussing Hume's refutation of causation. Hume argued that we can never see one event cause another, but only the constant conjunction of events. Kant suggests that Hume was confusing the phenomenal and noumenal worlds. Since we are autonomous, Kant now claims that we can know something about the noumenal world, namely that we are in it and play a causal role in it. This knowledge, however, is only practical and not theoretical. Therefore, it does not affect our knowledge of the things in themselves. Metaphysical speculation on the noumenal world is avoided. Analytic: Chapter Two Kant points out that every motive has an intended effect on the world. When it is desire that is driving us, we first examine the possibilities that the world leaves open to us, selecting some effect at which we wish to aim. Acting on the practical moral law does not work in this way. The only possible object of the practical law is the Good, since the Good is always an appropriate object for the practical law. It is necessary to avoid the danger of understanding the practical law simply as the law that tells us to pursue the good, and try to understand the Good as that at which the practical law aims. If we do not understand the good in terms of the practical law, then we need some other analysis by which to understand it. The only alternative is to mistakenly understand the Good as the pursuit of pleasure and evil as the production of pain to oneself. This sort of confusion between the Good and pleasure also arises when we confuse the concepts of good versus evil with the concepts of good versus bad. The good, when contrasted with the bad, is really just pleasure. But this is not the case with the good, in the sense of morally good. A morally good person may suffer from a painful disease (bad), but he does not therefore become a bad (evil) person. If a morally bad person is punished for his crimes, it may be bad (painful) for him, but good and just in the moral sense. The error of all past philosophical investigations into morality is that they have attempted to define the moral in terms of the good rather than the other way around. In this way, they have all fallen victim to the same error of confusing pleasure with morality. If one desires the good, one will act to satisfy that desire, that is in order to produce pleasure. The moral law, in Kant's view, is equivalent to the idea of freedom. Since the noumenal cannot be perceived, we can only know that something is morally right by intellectually considering whether a certain action that we wish to commit could be universally performed. Kant calls the idea that we can know what is right or wrong only through abstract reflection moral rationalism. This is to be contrasted with two alternative, mistaken approaches to moral epistemology: moral empiricism, which takes moral good and evil to be something we can apprehend from the world and moral mysticism, which takes morality to be a matter of sensing some supernatural property, such as the approbation of God. Although both positions are mistaken and harmful, according to Kant, moral empiricism is much more so because it is equivalent to the theory that the morally right is nothing more than the pursuit of pleasure. In this chapter, Kant makes his clearest and most explicit formulation of the position he adopts with respect to the question of the fundamental nature of morality. Kant's position is that moral goodness, which consists in following the rule of the categorical imperative, is more basic to ethics than good consequences, and that it is the right motivations‚Äîan obligation to duty‚Äîwhich is criterial for defining a person as good. Hence, Kant is a deontologist, in the terminology of contemporary philosophy, particularly that of analytic philosophy. He also takes a position on the important question of how we can distinguish what is right from what is wrong. Kant believes that we can never really be sure when we have witnessed a moral act, since the moral rightness of an act consists of its being caused in the right way from the noumenal world, which is by definition unknowable. Hence, he is a moral rationalist. Dialectic: Chapter One Pure reason, in both its theoretical and practical forms, faces a fundamental problem. Most things in the phenomenal realm of experience are conditional (i.e. they depend on something else) but pure reason always seeks for the unconditional. The problem is that the unconditional, according to Kant, is only to be found in the noumenal world. Pure reason, when it attempts to reach beyond its limits into the unconditional realm of the noumenon is bound to fail and the result is the creation of antinomies of reason. Antinomies are conflicting statements both of which appear to be validated by reason. Kant exposed several such antinomies of speculative reason in the first Critique. In the second Critique, he finds an antinomy of pure practical reason whose resolution is necessary in order to further our knowledge. In this case, the antinomy consists in the fact that the object of pure practical reason must be the highest good (Summum bonum). Good actions depend on the highest good to make them worthwhile. However, assuming the existence of a highest good leads to paradox and assuming the non-existence of a highest good also leads to paradox. Dialectic: Chapter Two Kant posits two different senses of \\"the highest good.\\" On one sense, it refers to that which is always good and which is required for all other goods. This sense is equivalent to \\"dutifulness\\". In another sense, it refers to the best of good states, even if part of that state is only contingently good. In this latter sense, the highest good combines virtuousness with happiness. The highest good is the object of pure practical reason, so we cannot use the latter unless we believe that the former is achievable. However, virtue obviously does not necessarily lead to happiness in this world and vice versa. To aim at one is not to aim at the other and it seems to be a matter of chance whether the rest of the world will fill in the gap by rewarding us for our virtuous behavior. But Kant's solution is to point out that we do not only exist phenomenally but also noumenally. Though we may not be rewarded with happiness in the phenomenal world, we may still be rewarded in an afterlife which can be posited as existing in the noumenal world. Since it is pure practical reason, and not just the maxims of impure desire-based practical reason, which demands the existence of such an afterlife, immortality, union with God and so on, then these things must be necessary for the faculty of reason as a whole and therefore they command assent. The highest good requires the highest level of virtue. We can know by self-examination that such virtue does not exist in us now, nor is it likely to exist in the foreseeable future. In fact, the only way in which the fallible human will can become similar to the holy will is for it to take an eternity to achieve perfection. Therefore, we can postulate the existence of immortality. If we do not postulate it, we will be led to either soften the demands of morality in order to make them achievable here and now or we will make the absurd demand on ourselves that we must achieve the holy will now. The highest good also requires the highest level of happiness, in order to reward the highest level of virtue. We therefore need to postulate that there is an omniscient God who can order the world justly and reward us for our virtue. Doctrine of method In the first Critique, the Doctrine of Method plans out the scientific study of the principles of pure theoretical reason. Here, however, the Doctrine of Method will instead be a discussion of how the principles of practical reason can be brought to bear on real life. In other words, the Doctrine of Method in the second Critique is fundamentally concerned with moral education: the question of how we can make people live and act morally. Kant has shown that truly moral behavior requires more than just the outward show of good behavior; it also requires the right inner motivations. The cynic or utilitarian might be doubtful as to whether it is truly possible for human beings to act out of an \\"obligation to duty.\\" In his view, even if we could produce a simulacrum of a moral society, it would all be an enormous theater of hypocrisy, since everyone would inwardly, privately continue to pursue his or her own advantage. Moreover, this outward show of morality would not be stable, but dependent on its continuing to be to the advantage of each individual. Fortunately, Kant believes, such doubts are misguided. Almost any time there is a social gathering of some sort, the conversation will include gossip and argumentation which entails moral judgments and evaluations about the rightness or wrongness of the actions of others. Even people who normally do not enjoy intricate arguments tend to reason acutely and with great attention to detail when they are caught about in the justification or condemnation of their next-door neighbors' behavior. Moral education should exploit this natural human tendency for moral evaluation by presenting the students with historical examples of good and evil actions. Through debating and discussing the worth of these examples on a case-by-case basis, the students will be given the opportunity to experience for themselves the admiration we feel for moral goodness and the disapproval that we feel for moral evil. However, it is necessary to select the right sorts of examples in order to demonstrate genuine moral goodness. And here, Kant says, we are liable to error in two ways. The first type of error consists in trying to attract students into being moral by providing them examples in which morality and self-love coincide. The second type of error consists in trying to emotionally arouse the students about morality by providing examples of extraordinary moral heroism, above what morality normally requires. The examples we choose should stress simple dutifulness. The first of these methods, argues Kant, is destined to fail because students will not come to understand the unconditional nature of duty. The examples will also not be very inspiring. When we see extraordinary self-sacrifice in the name of following a principle we are inspired and moved. But when we see someone following a principle with hardly any sacrifice or cost to himself, we are not equally impressed. The second method will also fail because it appeals to the emotions rather than to reason. It is only reason that can produce long-lasting change in a person's character. This method also leads students to associate morality with the impossible theatrics of melodrama, and therefore to disdain the everyday obligations they should be fulfilling as boring and useless. Kant ends the second Critique on a hopeful note about the future of ethics. The wonders of both the physical and the ethical worlds are not far for us to find: to feel awe, we should only look upward to the stars or inward to the moral law which we carry around within us. The study of the physical world was dormant for centuries and wrapped in superstition before the physical sciences actually came into existence. We are allowed to hope that soon the moral sciences will replace superstition with knowledge about ethics.

It is known for being the home and private amusement park of American entertainer Michael Jackson from 1988 until 2005. Originally named Zaca Laderas Ranch, the estate was renamed to Sycamore Valley Ranch shortly after it was purchased by property developer William Bone in 1981. In 1988, the ranch was sold to Jackson, who renamed it after Neverland, the fantasy island in the story of Peter Pan, a boy who never grows up. Jackson's first encounter with the ranch came when he visited Paul McCartney, who was staying there during their filming of the \\"Say Say Say\\" video in 1983. According to La Toya Jackson, Michael expressed interest to her in someday owning the property at that time. As of 2020, the ranch is co-owned by Colony Capital and the Estate of Michael Jackson, and is on and off again for sale. It is reported that Colony uses it as an investor retreat and to entertain celebrities. The ranch is located about 5 miles (8 km) north of unincorporated Los Olivos, and about eight miles (13 km) north of the town of Santa Ynez. The Chamberlin Ranch is to the west, and the rugged La Laguna Ranch, is to the north. The Santa Barbara County Assessor's office says the ranch is approximately 2,700 acres (1100 hectares). Background The estate was originally known as the Zaca Laderas Ranch at the time of its purchase by the property developer William Bone in 1981. Bone renamed the estate the Sycamore Valley Ranch and moved there with his family. Bone commissioned the architect Robert Altevers to design the principal buildings on the ranch, and the pair spent two and a half years researching potential designs and ideas. The 13,000 square foot (1,200 m¬≤) main house was completed in 1982, based on a design by Altevers, with formal gardens, a stone bridge, and a four-acre lake with a five-foot waterfall. Bone later said that in building the house he had \\"...a desire to express everything I had learned in 15 years of home building...I achieved here all the things I wanted to do in my business but could not\\". He had considered converting the property to a country club but did not do so. Residence of Michael Jackson Neverland's train station, Katherine Station, with floral clock Jackson purchased the estate from Bone in 1988 for an unknown amount: some sources indicate $19.5 million while others suggest it was closer to $30 million. The property was initially purchased by a trust with Jackson's lawyer, John Branca, and his accountant, Marshall Gelfand, as trustees, for reasons of privacy. The arrangement was later rescinded by Jackson in April 1988 and he became the ultimate owner of the property. It was Jackson's home as well as his private amusement park, with numerous artistic garden statues and a petting zoo. The property included three railroads: one narrow gauge named \\"Neverland Valley Railroad\\", with a steam locomotive named Katherine after his mother (Crown (2B), built in 1973), and two coaches. The other was a narrow gauge, with a C. P. Huntington replica locomotive made by Chance Rides. There was also a custom-made private electric train that was purchased by Jackson for his own children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. The train was manufactured in 2001 from a German company Elektro-Mobiltechnik. The train was set up in the yard at Neverland behind the main house and had 100 feet of track. There was also a Ferris wheel, Carousel, Zipper, Octopus, Pirate Ship, Wave Swinger, Super Slide, roller coaster, bumper cars, and an amusement arcade. The master closet also contained a secret safe room for security. Some of the events that took place at the Ranch included the wedding of Elizabeth Taylor and Larry Fortensky in 1991, the live Oprah Winfrey interview of Jackson in 1993, and an event in 1995 when Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley hosted children from around the world. Neverland Ranch was searched extensively by police officers in connection with the People v. Jackson trial after he was charged with multiple counts of molesting a minor in 2003. Jackson was acquitted of all charges. However, Jackson stated he would never live at the property again as he no longer considered the ranch a home and did not return to Neverland. Jackson's sister, La Toya, wrote of her experience staying at the ranch during her brother's trial in her 2012 memoir Starting Over. In 2006, the facilities were closed and most of the staff were dismissed, with a spokesperson stating that this was the reflection of the fact that Jackson no longer lived there. Neverland Ranch has a central role in the allegations against Jackson of child sexual abuse; it is one of the main sites where Jackson's accusers have said the sexual abuse took place. The ranch's association with sexual abuse allegations was described as a possible reason for a significant decrease in value.https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/neverland-ranch-for-sale-michael- jackson.html Financial status Reports of foreclosure proceedings against Neverland Ranch were published on October 22, 2007. A spokesperson for Jackson said that the loan was merely being refinanced and Jackson (later his estate) remained the majority stake holder, with a legal retention of 87.5% of the ranch. Former zoo buildings, July 2009 On February 25, 2008, Jackson received word from Financial Title Company, the trustee, that unless he paid off $24,525,906.61 by March 19, a public auction would go forward of the land, buildings, and other items such as the rides, trains, and art.Notice of Trustee's Sale, Santa Barbara County Recorder via Fox News Record no. 2008-0010131, February 25, 2008 On March 13, 2008, Jackson's lawyer L. Londell McMillan announced that a private agreement had been reached with the private investment group, Fortress Investment, to save Jackson's ownership of the ranch. Before the agreement, Jackson owed three months' arrears on the property. McMillan did not reveal the details of the deal. On May 12, 2008, a foreclosure auction for the ranch was canceled after Colony Capital, an investment company run by billionaire Tom Barrack, purchased the loan, which was in default. The selling price was $22.5 million. In a press release, Jackson stated, \\"I am pleased with recent developments involving Neverland Ranch and I am in discussions with Colony and Tom Barrack with regard to the Ranch and other matters that would allow me to focus on the future.\\" On November 10, 2008, Jackson transferred the title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company, LLC, and neighbors reported immediate activity on the property, including the amusement rides being trucked along the highway.

Restoration Aerial view of Neverland Ranch after the carnival rides were removed. The amusement rides and animals were gone by 2009, replaced with a meditative zen garden and a section decorated with Peter Pan, Michael Jackson's favorite fictional hero. In May 2015, it was announced that the Neverland Ranch, renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, would be put up for sale with an initial price tag of $100 million. By that time, Colony NorthStar had completed extensive renovations to the property. Many people, including fans, protested and disagreed with the decision. Jermaine Jackson, elder brother of Michael wrote an open letter to Colony NorthStar expressing his disagreement with their decision. As of May 2016, the 2,698 acre ranch, jointly owned by the Jackson estate and Colony NorthStar, was being sold by Sotheby's International Realty with an asking price of $100 million. The price included the 12,598 square foot six bedroom Normandy-style mansion, the four-acre lake with waterfall, a pool house, three guest houses, a tennis court, and a 5,500-square-foot movie theater and stage. The train station and railway tracks were also included. According to TIME, the owners were \\"specifically looking for a buyer who doesn‚Äôt plan to turn the place into a museum for the singer\\". Due to lack of interest, the asking price of the ranch had fallen to $67 million by February 2017. The property was still on the market in early 2018, at the same price, with Coldwell Banker. In February 2019, the asking price of the ranch was reduced to $31 million, $69 million less than the original asking price of $100 million in 2015. The listing agent for the ranch says nothing has changed except the price. The ranch's structures and landscaping are still being maintained.

He served as President of the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2016, which makes him Taiwan's longest-serving legislative speaker. Once a leading figure of the Kuomintang (KMT), Wang is considered to be soft-spoken and a conciliatory figure who has often brokered deals between the KMT and opposition DPP. Due to his longevity, experience and influence in political scene, he is widely a respected figure in Taiwanese politics. He was replaced by Democratic Progressive Party's Su Jia-chyuan as President of the Legislative Yuan after a decisive victory for the DPP in the 2016 election. Early life Wang was born in a simple rural community in Rochiku Village, Takao Prefecture, Taiwan, Empire of Japan (modern-day Lujhu, Kaohsiung). Living in villagers life, Wang gained positive mental and physical condition. Wang excelled in sports during his school years. His teachers encouraged him to enter the physical education department in university. Wang finished his elementary school in Tainan Municipal Dashe Elementary School. He finished his junior and senior high school from the Tainan First Senior High School in Tainan. In this school, Wang had always become the team leader of the school's tennis team. He finally graduated from the Teacher's College of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1965. Wang said that he never put extra efforts in academic studies since childhood and he doesn't believe in renowned star schools. However, his grades have always been good and his education went smoothly throughout his school years. Early career Upon graduation, Wang worked as a mathematics teacher for a year at the Provincial Ging-Der Senior High School in Changhua County. After his mandatory military service in the Republic of China Military Police was completed, Wang returned home to work for the family-run food processing company dealing with export and import trade. In early 1975, he represented his family business in the founding of Kaohsiung Industrial Association. He was elected as the director-in-chief of the association. His job involved travelling throughout Taiwan to inspect member factories and led to his entry into politics later that year. Political career =Legislative Yuan= Following his victory in the 1975 supplementary legislative election for the Kaohsiung County constituency, Wang took his seat in the Legislative Yuan on 1 February 1976 from being held by Huang Tung-shu previously. He has since been reelected eight times. From 1976 until 1990, he was a member of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan. In 1980, 1987 and 1990, Wang acted many times to assemble members of the Financial Committee and put his efforts forward in making some possible historical policies, such as introducing innovative tax system, opening up the establishment of security firms, lifting prohibition of setting up private banks, removing foreign exchange control schemes and other policies. =Kuomintang= On 10 April 1990, Wang was appointed as the Vice Chairman of the Central Policy Committee of the KMT, and then on 17 November 1990, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Central Policy Committee's Finance Commission. Wang became the KMT's first Director-General of the Committee on Coordination between Party and Government and the KMT Caucus Convener in the Legislative Yuan in 1992 following the retirement of all of Legislative Yuan first senior members on 31 December 1991. During that time, Wang was posted as KMT supervisor and started to search for a mechanism to make cross party negotiation possible. On 27 August 1993, Wang was elected to become the member of KMT Central Committee, and subsequently the member of Central Standing Committee during the 14th nationwide representative meeting of the party. =China-Japan Parliamentary Member Interactions Association= In 1993, Wang was appointed as the Director of China-Japan Parliamentary Member Interactions Association where he became more active in promoting parliamentary diplomacy. =Taiwan Foundation for Democracy= In 2003 Wang was elected as the chairman of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, which was a democracy developing project set up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the ROC. =Other organizations= Wang also holds other public welfare positions, such as the President of the Council for Taiwan Major League Baseball Association, Board Chairman of the Formosa Cancer Foundation, President of the Council for National Volunteer Fire Fighters‚Äô Association, Honored Board Chairman of the Charity Mothers Association and Honored Board Chairman of the National No- Barrier Space Development Association. Legislative Yuan Vice Presidency On 1 February 1993, Wang became the KMT candidate for the nomination of Vice President post of the Legislative Yuan. Supported by the majority, he secured his post and started to lead the congress. He renewed his three-year post in 1996, serving the post consecutively from 1 February 1993 until 31 January 1999. During his office term, Wang successfully completed the passing of many important laws, such as the Self-governance Law for Provinces and Counties, Municipal Self-governance Law, National Health Insurance Law, February 28 Incident Disposition and Compensation Act, Joint Development Law, Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance Law, Government Procurement Law, Three Laws Pertaining to National Security, Three Laws Pertaining to Communication. Wang was also actively involved in promoting congress diplomacy. He had represented the Legislative Yuan as Vice President visiting abroad and also as representative to receive guests from foreign countries. Kuomintang Vice Chairmanship 2008 ROC Presidential election. Wang had been the vice chairman of KMT in 2000-2005. =ROC Presidential election= During the 2004 presidential election, he served as campaign manager for the Lien Chan and James Soong ticket. Considered part of the pro-localization faction in the KMT, his strong support and active campaigning for the Lien-Soong ticket was considered very significant as it blunted criticism that Lien-Soong were anti-Taiwan. There were calls, which he ignored, from many figures such as Lee Teng-hui for him to abandon Lien and join the Taiwan Solidarity Union before the election. Prior to July 2005, he was, along with Ma Ying-jeou touted as possible presidential candidates for 2008. As a southerner, a native Hoklo speaker, and a legislator and person identified with the pro-localization faction of the Kuomintang, he was expected to provide balance to Ma Ying-jeou, who was rooted in northern Taiwan, and someone more identified with the unification-leaning parts of the party. =2005 KMT Chairmanship election= However, on 16 July 2005, Ma defeated Wang in the first competitive election for KMT chairmanship by a 72% to 28% margin, a margin larger than anticipated by either camp or news sources, despite Wang's receiving a last-minute endorsement by People First Party chairman James Soong, who had retained significant following within the KMT. Immediately after the election, Ma stated repeatedly that he wished Wang to remain as first-ranked deputy chairman. Wang, however, has so far rebuffed the gesture, instead stating that he wishes to serve as \\"permanent volunteer,\\" and snubbed Ma by refusing to meet with him. Wang has, indeed, accepted a party post that is incompatible with vice chairmanship, effectively ending the possibility that he would be vice chairman, although after meeting with Wang, Ma said that he would \\"leave the position open\\" for Wang. { border=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse;\\" width=\\"400\\" ----- bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !

Although Wang did not join the primary election, Wang has also not ruled out running as an independent. Though Ma had offered Wang the nomination as the KMT's Vice Presidential candidate, Wang recently declined the offer, saying that the pressure of being legislative Speaker was too great for him to be able to consider the offer.Taiwan's Ma rebuffed in bid to bring rival onto presidential ticket, The China Post, 31 May 2007. After weeks of talks and discussions among the Pan-Blue heavy weights including Lien, Wang, Wu and Ma, there was no agreement made to field a Ma-Wang President-Vice President ticket. At the end, Wang decided to turn down Ma's offer of Vice Presidency, but stated that he would do his utmost to support Ma in the upcoming election. Legislative Yuan Presidency =4th Legislative Yuan= Due to his easygoing nature and willingness to listen to differing perspectives, Wang was elected as President of the 4th Legislative Yuan on 1 February 1999 with a majority vote of 135 out of 225 seats. Within just one year after taking his new post, Wang promoted adjustments in organization, reinforced staff members, crossed party negotiation according to the five major Legislative Reorganization Act. By doing so, he opened a model in congress reform and contributed to the completion of discussion by the end of the 4th session. During the first half of the session, Wang had passed a total of 60 new laws, confirming the plan to move Legislative Yuan to a new place. In the second half of the session, a total of 96 laws were passed, the second highest in ROC history when 148 laws were passed in 1948. =5th Legislative Yuan= The KMT lost its majority for the first time in the 2001 legislative election, but through the narrow Pan-Blue Coalition majority, he was reelected president for the 5th Legislative Yuan on 1 February 2002. As Legislative Yuan President, Wang has gained a reputation of being a soft-spoken figure capable of reaching across party lines. =6th Legislative Yuan= 2005 Busan APEC In the APEC meeting at South Korea in late 2005, President Chen Shui-bian nominated Wang as the representative for Chinese Taipei, the designated name for ROC in APEC. The KMT approved of the nomination. This nomination did not become a reality, however, as the PRC pressured South Korea to ask for a second nomination. Despite lobbying by former South Korean president Kim Young-sam, who visited Chen in that time period, Chen was forced to name another person. This cat fight actually exacerbated Taiwan's image, as the summit yearbook did not even mention Taiwan's presence. The host explanation was that the second nomination was submitted well past the deadline for the yearbook. =7th Legislative Yuan= Until 2011, Kuomintang legislators were barred from seeking an at-large third term. The restriction was lifted that year, for politicians who made \\"special contributions to the party, meet the needs of the party and have served as legislative speaker,\\" and Wang continued serving as Yuan President. During the final plenary session of the 7th Legislative Yuan on 14 December 2011, Wang said that the Yuan had passed a total of 896 bills and resolutions over the past four years, including the Special Statute for Distributing Consumption Vouchers for Revitalizing the Economy, Cross- Strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement and legislation regarding the 2G national health insurance program, gender equality and justice in housing. Wang encouraged the yuan to continue its oversight functions on behalf of the public in the future as a power to promote the development of Taiwan. =8th Legislative Yuan= Influence peddling On 7 September 2013, according to information gathered through wiretap recordings, President Ma Ying-Jeou accused Wang of influence peddling, a move that damages KMT reputation. The move came during Wang's trip to Malaysia to attend his daughter's wedding. Wang was officially expelled from the KMT on 11 September, disqualifying his eligibility to serve as a KMT legislator and ending his 14-year speakership tenure in the Legislative Yuan. The Special Investigation Division of the ROC Supreme Prosecutor Office accused Wang of illegally lobbying for Democratic Progressive Party caucus whip Ker Chien-ming in a breach of trust case by asking the then-Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu and the Head Prosecutor of Taiwan High Prosecutors Office Chen Shou-huang (Èô≥ÂÆàÁÖå) to use their influence to stop an appeal of a not-guilty verdict for Ker. On 11 September 2013, Wang sent an attorney to the Taipei District Court to file for an injunction for his KMT membership revocation. On 13 September 2013, the court approved Wang's request for which Wang had to put NT$9.38 million as a bail. This move ruled that Wang is still the member of Kuomintang and the President of Legislative Yuan until further notice. This court decision however is rejected by KMT Chairman and President Ma Ying-jeou and announced that the party will file for a counter-appeal against the decision. Many support movements around Taiwan were shown to support Wang. After the disciplinary action against Wang, 11 neighborhood wardens in Wang's hometown in Lujhu, Kaohsiung gave up their KMT membership. Wang called upon them to stay within they party. Upon Wang's arrival in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport from Malaysia, thousands of supporters awaited him, including lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu. People First Party Chairman James Soong criticized Ma regarding the allegation, citing that politics should have some humanity. Support for President Ma Ying-jeou came from Wang Chien-shien, President of Control Yuan. He said that despite KMT legislators comprising about three-quarters, or 84 members out of total 113 seats in the Legislative Yuan, the KMT was still being held hostage by opposition Democratic Progressive Party, adding that KMT had accomplish nothing from 2008 until 2012 due to Wang Jin-pyng's inability to deal with people and negotiate. The KMT officially lifted at large term limits for affiliated politicians who had previously served as leader of the legislature in October 2015. Later political career On 7 March 2019, Wang announced his intention to contest the Kuomintang nomination for the 2020 Taiwan presidential election. He withdrew from the 2019 Kuomintang presidential primary on 6 June 2019. On 17 June, Wang reiterated, \\"I will run [for president] to the end, although it is difficult to explain how I will do that,\\" though he would not consider leaving the Kuomintang or a vice presidential candidacy. Personal life Wang's father, Wang Ko, is the man behind Wang's current family business today. At the age of 28, on 26 March 1969 Wang met his then-future wife Chen Tsai-lien during the anniversary celebration of Shih Chien Home Economics College at the Feng-Lin Restaurant. It was love at the first sight and both felt a deep connection towards one another. They held their engagement ceremony at Mandarina Crown Hotel.

The island is separated from the Tasmanian mainland by the D'Entrecasteaux Channel, and its east coast lies within the Tasman Sea. Storm Bay is located to the island's northeast. Both the island and the channel are named after French explorer Bruni d'Entrecasteaux. Its traditional Aboriginal name is lunawanna-allonah, which survives as the name of two island settlements, Alonnah and Lunawanna. Geography Geologically, Bruny Island is actually two land masses‚ÄîNorth Bruny and South Bruny‚Äîthat are joined by a long, narrow sandy isthmus (often referred to as ‚ÄúThe Neck‚Äù) . Bruny Island has a total length of approximately . The holiday village of Dennes Point is located in North Bruny, while South Bruny is the site of the towns of Alonnah, Adventure Bay and Lunawanna. Aerial perspective of the isthmus of Bruny Island Outside its settlements the island is covered in grazing fields and large tracts of dry eucalyptus forest. Inland forests continue to be logged, but other large sections‚Äîmostly along the southeastern coast‚Äîare preserved as the South Bruny National Park. While the seaward side of the island features two long beaches‚ÄîAdventure Bay and Cloudy Bay‚Äîit is for the most part extremely rugged, with cliffs of dolerite that are over . Bruny's channel side is far more sheltered and a favourite fishing and recreational boating area for local and interstate visitors. Adventure Bay is located on the eastern side of the isthmus, while Isthmus Bay is located on the western side.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10114401 Access to the island is by vehicular ferry, funded by the State Government. Since 1954, four vessels have operated the Bruny Island Ferry service between the island and Kettering on the mainland. The service is currently plied by the Mirambeena, which is unusual for using a Voith-Schneider propulsion system rather than a conventional propeller. The d'Entrecastaux Channel region, sheltered by Bruny Island, is increasingly subject to foreshore erosion, some areas have begun sandbagging to reduce the effects.Flora Fox, Flora Fox, News and Information about Southern Tasmania 2011 History Bruny Island was originally inhabited by Aboriginal Tasmanians until European arrival, and there is still a large community of people who identify as Aboriginal. Abel Tasman tried to land in the vicinity of Adventure Bay in November 1642. In 1773 Tobias Furneaux was the first recorded European to land on the island at Adventure Bay (named after his ship); four years later on 26 January 1777 James Cook's two ships, the Resolution and Discovery stayed in the bay area for two days. Cook carved his initials in a tree that was destroyed in a 1905 bushfire and is now commemorated by a plaque. In 1788 and again in 1792 (with Matthew Flinders) William Bligh stayed in the Adventure Bay area. The island itself however is named after the French explorer Bruni d'Entrecasteaux who explored the Channel region and discovered it to be an island in 1792. It was known as Bruni Island until 1918, when the spelling was changed to Bruny. Whaling was conducted off the coast of Bruny Island in the first half of the 19th century. The British whaler Alexander was reported to be whaling in Adventure Bay in 1804. In 1805, the British whalers Richard and Mary, Ocean and the Sydney whaler King George were reported there in the winter months. The American whaler Topaz was there in 1807. Colonial entrepreneurs also operated shore-based whaling stations there. Bethune and Kelly had a station operating in Adventure Bay by August 1826. Kelly and Lucas had another at Bull Bay. Young and Walford had one at Trumpeter Bay. Alexander Imlay applied for the site as a whaling station at Cloudy Bay in 1837, and Brown and Rogers did the same in 1842.Evans, p.17. These stations had all ceased operating by 1850, although whaling vessels sometimes anchored offshore in the second half of the century.Evans, p.12, Even though \\"Cooktown\\" was marked on maps as early as the 1840s, the island was not officially opened up to European settlement until the late 1800s when the timber industry took off. South Bruny was opened up by numerous tramways and haulages, some horse-drawn and some using modified locomotives. The longest and best preserved tramway runs from Adventure Bay to the far southeast corner of the island. Almost all settlements on South Bruny were originally opened as timber ports owned by the different timber companies operating on the island. Lunawanna (former Daniels Bay), Alonnah (former Mills Reef) and Adventure Bay were some of the largest ports operating on the island. At Daniels Bay, the settlement was separated from the timber jetty as the tramway was forced to trace along the south side of the bay to reach deep water as most of the bay was too shallow to bring boats in. Most settlements of South Bruny now serve as shack towns or holiday locations. Since the 1920s the island has become known as a holiday location with surfing beaches, National Parks and historical sites. In more recent history the Bruny Island was the site of a land transfer by the state government to local Aboriginal people. Environment Bruny Island is classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the world's largest population of the endangered forty-spotted pardalote, up to a third of the world population of the swift parrot, all 12 of Tasmania's endemic bird species, and up to 240,000 breeding pairs of the short-tailed shearwater (or Tasmanian muttonbird).  Tourism  A key contributor to Bruny Island's economy is its growing tourism industry. Being home to the South Bruny National Park, tourism on the island centres on the showcase of its natural assets. The Cape Bruny Lighthouse, first lit in 1838, is an iconic Australian lighthouse. It was the third lighthouse built in Tasmania, and the fourth in all of Australia, and was the longest continuously manned lighthouse in the country until it was automated in 1993. It was removed from service in 1996, and became part of the South Bruny National Park in 2000. Guided tours of the structure are available. In 2010/11, overall visitors to Bruny Island increased 4% to 74,600. The island is primarily a day-trip destination with only 21,800 visitors staying on the island overnight. There are a growing number of tourism businesses on the island including a cheese factory, oyster farm, vineyard, smokehouse, lighthouse, museum, art gallery, two eco-cruises along with various accommodation properties and cafes. Localities Bruny Island is divided into eleven bounded localities. The two largest by area are North Bruny and South Bruny which consist of national park, state forest and some grazing areas and do not have postcodes. On North Bruny there are five populated coastal enclaves: Apollo Bay, Barnes Bay, Dennes Point, Great Bay and Killora. On South Bruny there are four: Adventure Bay, Alonnah, Lunawanna and Simpsons Bay.

The feminine form, executrix, may sometimes be used. Overview Auguste Renoir, Portrait of a Woman, called of Mme Georges Hartmann, gift from General Bourjat, executor of Georges Hartmann (Mus√©e d'Orsay) An executor is a legal term referring to a person named by the maker of a will or nominated by the testator to carry out the instructions of the will. Typically, the executor is the person responsible for offering the will for probate, although it is not required that they fulfill this. The executor's duties also include disbursing property to the beneficiaries as designated in the will, obtaining information of potential heirs, collecting and arranging for payment of debts of the estate and approving or disapproving creditors' claims. An executor will make sure estate taxes are calculated, necessary forms are filed, and . They will also assist the attorney with the estate. Additionally, the executor acts as a legal conveyor who designates where the donations will be sent using the information left in bequests, whether they be sent to charity or other organizations. In most circumstances, the executor is the representative of the estate for all purposes, and has the ability to sue or be sued on behalf of the estate. The executor holds legal title to the estate property, but may not use the title or property for their own benefit, unless permitted by the terms of the will. A person who deals with a deceased person's property without proper authority is known as an executor de son tort. Such a person's actions may subsequently be ratified by the lawful executors or administrators if the actions do not contradict the substantive provisions of the deceased's will or the rights of heirs at law. When there is no will, a person is said to have died intestate‚Äî\\"without testimony.\\" As a result, there is no tangible \\"testimony\\" to follow, and hence there can be no executor. If there is no will or the executors named in a will do not wish to act, an administrator of the deceased's estate may instead be appointed. The generic term for executors or administrators is personal representative. In England and Wales, when a person dies intestate in a nursing home, and has no family members who can be traced, those responsible for their care automatically become their executors. Under Scottish law, a personal representative of any kind is referred to as an executor, using executor nominate to refer to an executor and executor dative to an administrator. Executor pay In some countries, such as the United States, an executor is automatically entitled to compensation for his or her services, although this amount varies dramatically by jurisdiction. Unless specifically set by the will, this compensation is often determined by what is considered ‚Ä≥reasonable‚Ä≥ for the effort involved, although in a number of jurisdictions, the amount is instead set as a percentage of the overall estate. For example, in California the executor is entitled to 4% of the first $100K of estate value, 3% of the next $100K, and so on. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the executor is not automatically entitled to compensation, although compensation can be directed within the will or on application to a court.Executor Pay: Fees for the Executor or Administrator of an Estate, duhaime.org retrieved 19 January 2012 Insurance policies In recent years, custom \\"executors' insurance\\" policies have entered the marketplace. These are currently available in countries including Canada, England, and Wales. They are often taken up by non-professional executors--typically friends or family of the deceased--who may be worried about potentially making an error during the probate process and/or uncomfortable about exposing themselves to unlimited personal financial and legal liability. Many find such cover an attractive proposition as the vast majority of wills allow reasonable expenses, such as the cost of the policy, to be reclaimed from the deceased's estate.

During Mapai's time in office, a wide range of progressive reforms were carried out,http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/idelson- bebahttp://www.ilo.org/ifpdial/information-resources/national-labour-law- profiles/WCMS_158902/lang--en/index.htm as characterised by the establishment of a welfare state, providing minimum income, security, and free (or almost free) access to housing subsidies and health and social services.The Welfare state and its aftermath by Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt and Ora Ahimeir History The party was founded on 5 January 1930 by the merger of the Hapoel Hatzair founded by A. D. Gordon and the original Ahdut HaAvoda (founded in 1919 from the right, more moderate, wing of the Zionist socialist Poale Zion led by David Ben-Gurion). In the early 1920s the Labor Zionist movement had founded the Histadrut Union, which dominated the Hebrew settlement economy and infrastructure, later making Mapai the dominant political faction in Zionist politics. It was also responsible for the founding of Hashomer and Haganah, the first two armed Jewish groups which secured the people and property of the new and emerging Jewish communities. By the early 1930s, David Ben-Gurion had taken over the party, and had become de facto leader of the Jewish community in Palestine (known as the Yishuv). It was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1930 and 1940.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 ‚Äì 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 315 The party was Jewish-only until the late 1960s, with a succession of satellite parties for Israeli Arabs, including the Democratic List of Nazareth, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Agriculture and Development, Progress and Work, Cooperation and Brotherhood, Progress and Development and Cooperation and Development. It supported the policy of subjecting Arab citizens to martial law, which included confining them to the towns of their residence, and allowing them to exit only with a permit granted by the Israeli authorities. Politics and government Due to its role in emerging victorious and independent from the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the party won large support in Israel's first elections in 1949, winning 35.7% of the vote (well ahead of second-placed Mapam's 14.7%) and 46 of the 120 seats. Ben-Gurion became Prime Minister and formed a coalition with the United Religious Front, the Progressive Party, the Sephardim and Oriental Communities and the Democratic List of Nazareth (an Israeli Arab party associated with Mapai). A notable piece of legislation enacted during Mapai's first term in office was an educational law in 1949 which introduced compulsory schooling for all children between the ages of 5 to 14.The Challenge Of Israel by Misha Louvish Mapai's years in office also witnessed the passage of the National Insurance Act of 1953 and the Social Welfare Service Law of 1958, which authorised a broad range of social welfare programmes, including special allowances for large families, workers' compensation provisions, maternity insurance, and old age and survivors' pensions.http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6746.html In the second elections in 1951 Mapai increased its vote to 37.3% (and 47 seats) despite the country's economic problems. Ben-Gurion again formed the government with the support of Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, Agudat Yisrael, Poalei Agudat Yisrael and the three Israeli Arab parties associated with Mapai, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. However, he shocked the nation by resigning on 6 December 1953 in order to settle in the small Negev kibbutz of Sde Boker, and was replaced by Moshe Sharett. The 1955 elections saw a drop in the party's support to 32.2% (and 40 seats), though still well ahead of the second-placed Herut (12.6%). Ben Gurion returned as Prime Minister, and formed a coalition with the National Religious Front (which later changed its name to the National Religious Party), Mapam, Ahdut HaAvoda, and the three Israeli Arab parties, the Democratic List for Israeli Arabs, Progress and Work and Agriculture and Development. Later the Progressive Party was also added. In contrast to the previous one, the 1959 election saw a surge in support, as the party recorded its best electoral performance, taking 38.2% of the vote and 47 seats. Ben-Gurion again invited the National Religious Party, Mapam, Ahdut HaAvoda, the Progressive Party and the three Israeli Arab parties, Progress and Development, Cooperation and Brotherhood and Agriculture and Development to form the coalition. The inquiry into the Lavon Affair which brought down the government in 1961 probably contributed to the party's relatively poor performance in the elections in the same year, as it picked up only 34.7% of the vote and 42 seats. Although Ben- Gurion formed a strong coalition with the National Religious Party, Ahdut HaAvoda, Agudat Yisrael Workers, Cooperation and Brotherhood and Progress and Development, two events during the fifth Knesset led to Mapai's reducing dominance. Firstly, Ben-Gurion resigned as head of the party citing personal reasons, though in reality he was upset at a perceived lack of support from colleagues. He set up a new party, Rafi, taking with him seven other Mapai members. Secondly, the two major right-wing opposition parties, Herut and the Liberal Party had merged into Gahal. This meant by the end of the Knesset session, Mapai had only 34 seats to Gahal's 27. The party's response to the unprecedented strength of the opposition was to seek support from other parties with similar ideologies. The result was an alliance with Ahdut HaAvoda to form the Labor Alignment before the 1965 election. The new party won 36.7% of the vote and 45 seats, and comfortably beat Gahal (26 seats). On 23 January 1968 Mapai, Ahdut HaAvoda and Rafi merged into the Israeli Labor Party and ceased to exist as individual entities.

Tuqay is often referred as the founder of the modern Tatar literature and the modern Tatar literary language, which replaced Old Tatar language in literature. Early life ƒûabdulla Tuqay was born in the family of the hereditary village mullah of Qu≈ülawƒ±√ß, Kazan Governorate, Russian Empire (current Tatarstan, Russia) near the modern town of Arsk. His father, M√∂x√§mm√§tƒü√§rif M√∂x√§mm√§tƒü√§lim ulƒ± Tuqayƒ±v, had been a village mandative mullah since 1864. In 1885 his wife died, leaving him a son and a daughter, and M√∂x√§mm√§tƒü√§rif married second wife, M√§md√ºd√§, daughter of √ñ√ßile village mullah Zinn√§tulla Z√§ynepb√§≈üir ulƒ±. On 29 August O.S. M√∂x√§mm√§tƒü√§rif died when ƒûabdulla was five months old. Soon ƒûabdulla's grandfather also died and M√§md√ºd√§ was forced to return to her father and then to marry the mullah of the village of Sasna. Little ƒûabdulla lived for some time with an old woman in his native village, before his new stepfather agreed to take Tuqay into his family. Tuqay's relatively happy childhood did not last long: on O.S. 18 January 1890 ƒûabdulla's mother M√§md√ºd√§ also died, and Tuqay was removed to his poor grandfather Zinn√§tulla. Lacking enough food even for his own children, his grandfather sent ƒûabdulla to Kazan with a coachman. There the coachman took Tuqay to a market-place, Pe√ß√§n Bazaar, hoping to find someone willing to adopt the child. A tanner named M√∂x√§mm√§tw√§li and his wife ƒû√§ziz√§ from the Ya√±a-Bist√§ area of Kazan decided to take care of him. While living in Kazan, Tuqay was taken ill with walleye. When 1892, when both of ƒûabdulla's adoptive parents became sick they had to send him back to his grandfather. This time, ƒûabdulla's grandfather sent the child for further adoption to the village of Qƒ±rlay, where ƒûabdulla stayed with the family of a peasant S√§ƒüdi. During his stay with this family, ƒûabdulla was sent to the local madrassah (religious school), for the first time in his life, where, in his own words, his enlightenment began. In the fall of 1895, the ƒûosmanovs, Tatar merchants living in Uralsk, decided to adopt their distant relatives, because their own children had died. ƒû√§li√§sƒüar ƒûosmanov and his wife ƒû√§ziz√§, ƒûabdulla's aunt, asked a peasant from Qu≈ülawƒ±√ß to bring them ƒûabdulla. The peasant took ten- year-old Tuqay away from S√§ƒüdi, threatening him with Russian papers and the village constable. Living in Uralsk, ƒûabdulla attended to Mot√≠ƒü√≠a madrassah. Simultaneously, in 1896, he started to attend a Russian school. There, for the first time in his life, he became acquainted with the world of Russian literature and started to write poetry. In 1899 the anniversary of Alexander Pushkin was widely celebrated in Uralsk, an event which inspired Tuqay's interest in Russian poetry, especially works by Pushkin. ƒûosmanov tried to interest ƒûabdulla in his work, but Tuqay stayed indifferent to the merchant's lot, preferring to develop his education. On 30 July 1900 ƒû√§li√§sƒüar ƒûosmanov died of \\"stomach diseases\\", so Tuqay moved into the madrassah itself, living first in common room, and two years later in a khujra, an individual cell. In the madrassah Tuqay proved himself a diligent student, completing in ten years a program intended for fifteen. However, he continued to live in poverty. By 1902, ƒûabdulla, age 16, had changed his nature. He lost interest in studying the Qur'an, and showed criticism to all that was taught in madrassah. He didn't shave his hair, he drank beer and even smoked. At the same time, he became more interested in poetry. –¢—É–∫–∞–π. –ò. –ù—É—Ä—É–ª–ª–∏–Ω.

In the madrassah itself he became familiar with Arabic, Persian and Turkish poetry, as well as poetry in the Old Tatar language of the earlier centuries. In 1900 Mot√≠ƒü√≠a graduate, a Tatar poet Mirx√§yd√§r √áulpan√≠ visited the madrassah. ƒûabdulla met him and √áulpan√≠ became the first living poet to impress Tuqay. √áulpan√≠ wrote in \\"elevated style\\", using aruz, an Oriental poetic system, and mostly in Old Tatar language, full of Arab, Persian and Turkish words, and rather distant from the Tatar language itself. In 1902-1903 he met a Turkish poet Abd√ºlveli, concealed himself there from Abdul Hamid II pursuits. Thus, Tuqay adopted Oriental poetic tradition. Young teacher, the son of headmaster, Kamil \\"Mot√≠ƒü√≠\\" T√∂xf√§tullin, organized wallpaper M√§ƒü√§rif (The Education) and hand-written journals. The first odes of Tuqay were published there, and he was referred as \\"the first poet of the madrassah\\". In 1904 Mot√≠ƒü√≠ founded his own publishing company, and Tuqay became clerk there. He combined this job with teaching younger shakirds in the madrassah. He introduced new methods, typical for the Russian school. After the October Manifesto of 1905 it became possible to publish newspapers in the Tatar language, which was strictly forbidden earlier. However, Mot√≠ƒü√≠ wasn't enough solvent to open his own newspaper, so he bought the Russian language newspaper Uralets with typography, to print also a Tatar newspaper there. Tuqay became a typesetter. The newspaper was named Fiker (The Thought). Then Mot√≠ƒü√≠ started to issue √Ñlƒüasr√§lcadid (The New Century) magazine. Tuqay sent his first verses there to be published. At the same time he started writing for a newspaper and began participating in the publishing of several Tatar magazines. At day Tuqay worked in typography (he was already a proofreader), but by nights he wrote verses, so every issue of Fiker, Nur and √Ñlƒüasr√§lcadid contains his writing. More over, he wrote articles, novels and feuilletons for those periodicals, he translated Krylov fables for the magazine. It is also known that Tuqay spread social-democratic leaflets and translated social- democratic brochure to the Tatar language. Despite social-democrats' negative attitude towards the Manifesto, in his verses Tuqay admired with Manifesto, believing in the progressive changes of the Tatar lifestyle. During that period he shared his views with liberals, as the long-standing tradition of the Tatar enlightenment didn't distinguished national-liberation movement from the class struggle and negated the class struggle within Tatar nation. The most prominent writings of that period are Mill√§t√§ (To the Nation) poem and Bezne√± mill√§t, √ºlg√§nme, √§ll√§ yoqlaƒüan ƒüƒ±namƒ±? (Has our nation dead, or just sleeps?) article. Since the satirical magazine Uqlar (The Arrows) appeared in Uralsk, Tuqay renowned himself as satirist. The main target of his jeers was Muslim clergy, who stayed opposed to progress and Europeanization. As for the language of the most of his verses, it still stayed the Old Tatar language and continued the Oriental traditions, such as in Pu≈ükin√§ (To Pushkin). However, in some of them, directed to the Tatar peasantry a pure Tatar was used, what was newly for the Tatar poetry. In January 1906 police conducted a search of the typography, as rebellious articles were published in the newspaper. The First State Duma was dismissed, the revolution came to naught. The ultra-right Russian nationalists from the Black Hundred proposed that Tatars emigrate to the Ottoman Empire. That period his most prominent verses devoted to the social themes and patriotism were composed: Gosudarstvennaya Dumaƒüa (To the State Duma), Sorƒ±qortlarƒüa (To the Parasites) and Kitmibez! (We don‚Äôt leave!). Tuqay was disappointed in liberalism and sympathized with socialists, especially Esers. In Kitmibez! he answered to the Black Hundred that the Tatars are a brother people of the Russians and immigration to Turkey is impossible. On 6 January 1907 Tuqay left madrassah, as his fee permitted him to live independently, and settled in a hotel room. He became an actual editor of Uqlar, being the lead poet and publicist of all Mot√≠ƒü√≠'s periodicals. That time liberal Fiker and Tuqay himself was in confrontation with Qadimist, i.e. ultraconservative Bayan al-Xaq, which even called for pogrom of liberal press activists. However, that year he was surprisingly discharged, as the result of the conflict with Kamil Mot√≠ƒü√≠ and instigation of the typography workers for a strike to raise a salary. On 22 February 1907 Mot√≠ƒü√≠ was deprived of publishing rights and his publishers was sold to merchant, who attracted Tuqay to the work again, but sonly dismissed the periodicals. That time Tuqay departed from the social-democrats and politics generally, preferring to devote himself to poetry. Since mid-1906 to autumn 1907 more than 50 verses were written, as well as 40 articles and feuilletons. That time he turned to a pure Tatar, using a spoken language. Impressed by Pushkin's fairy-tale poem Ruslan and Lyudmila, Tuqay wrote his first poem, ≈û√ºr√§le. It is known, that Mot√≠ƒü√≠ tried to establish another newspaper, Ya√±a Tormƒ±≈ü (The New Life) in Uralsk, with Tuqay as one of constitutors, but that time ƒûabdulla was already so popular in the Tatar society, that chief editors from Kazan, the Tatar cultural capital, offered him job. Moreover, Tuqay should be examined by a draft board in his native uyezd, and he left Uralsk anyway. The admiration with the future trends of his life in Kazan is expressed in Par at (The Pair of Horses), which consequently became the most associated with Kazan Tatar verse. =Kazan period= Yalt-Yolt coverƒûabdulla Tuqay in hospital, 1913. Just after the arrival to Kazan, Tuqay stayed at Bolƒüar hotel and met Tatar literature intelligentsia, such as playwright and Yoldƒ±z newspaper secretary ƒû√§li√§sƒüar Kamal and prominent Tatar poet and Ta√± yoldƒ±zƒ± newspaper chief editor S√§ƒüit R√§miev. Several days after he left Kazan to be examined by a draft board, assembly point being in √Ñtn√§ village. There he was discarded due his poor health and walleye and freed up of serving in the Russian Imperial Army. He returned to Kazan and renowned his literature and publishing activity. He was adopted to the editorial staff of democratically oriented √Ñl- ƒ∞slax gazette, led by Fatix √Ñmirxan and Wafa B√§xti√§rev. However, the newspaper had a little budget. Tuqay had got fixed up as a forwarding agent in Kitap publishers, to provide guaranteed wage. Moreover, he refused offer from √Ñxbar, an organ of Ittifaq al-Muslimin, a political party, close to Kadets, as well as other offers from rich, but right newspapers. He also continued self- education: read Russian classics, critiques, and studied German language. He was interested in studying the life of common people by visiting bazaars and pubs. Tuqay's room in Bolƒüar hotel was frequently visited by admirers from \\"gilded youth\\". As he wrote, their boozing-up impeded him and his creation. Nevertheless, in the end of 1907-1908 he wrote nearby sixty verses and twenty articles in √Ñl-ƒ∞slax and satirical journal Y√§≈üen (The Illumination), and also published two books of verses. The most prominent satire of that period was Pe√ß√§n Bazarƒ± yaxud Ya√±a Kisekba≈ü (The Hay Bazaar or New Ki≈üekba≈ü), deriding problems of the Tatar society of the period, clergy and merchant class. As for Tuqay's personal life, there is known little about it. As usual he avoided women in his circle. It is known that he was enamored of Z√§yt√ºn√§ M√§wl√ºdova, his 15-year-old admirer. Several verses were devoted to Z√§yt√ºn√§ and their feelings, such as A Strange Love. However, later Tuqay did not develop their relations, and the possible reason was inferiority complex, attributed to his health and financial position. In May 1908 an article, comparing Tuqay's, R√§miev's and Majit Ghafuri's poetries was published in Russian-language Volzhsko-Kamsky Vestnik. In August 1908 Kamal founded satirical journal Y√§≈üen under Tuqay's pressure. The most of published works were written by Tuqay, of course. In August 1908 Kamal and Tuqay visit the Makaryev Fair, placed in Nizhny Novgorod. There Tuqay temporarily joined the first Tatar theatre troupe, S√§yyar, singing national songs and declaiming his verses from scene. On 14 October ƒûabdulla Tuqay presented his new satirical poem The Hay Bazaar or New Kisekba≈ü, based on classical Old Tatar poem Kisekba≈ü. In own poem he derided nationalism among Tatars, as well as W√§isi sect's fanatics, associating sect's leader, ƒûaynan W√§isev with Di√º, an evil spirit from Kisekba≈ü. =1909-1910 crisis= In 1909-1910 all freedoms, gained by 1905 revolution came to naught under Stolypin's policy. As a result, leftist sympathized ƒûabdulla Tuqay was nearly disappointed in his activity and was in depression. Another reason was in his friends, moved to rightist newspapers, like Kamal and R√§miev. The most of his verses were depressive, however, Tuqay stayed productive, he published nearby hundred verses, two fairy tale poems, autobiography, and an article about Tatar folklore (Xalƒ±q √§d√§bi√§te, i.e. Folk Literature), wrote thirty feuilletons and printed twenty books, not only with own poems, but also compiled of folk songs. In those years Tuqay became staunch leftist, despite of his staying with one bourgeois family for some time: √Ñl-ƒ∞slax became a leftist political newspaper only, Tuqay criticized all his former friends, turned to the right or liberal newspapers: Zarif B√§≈üiri from Oremburgean √á√ºke√ß and S√§ƒüit R√§miev from B√§y√§nelxaq. He called them bourgeoisie's stooges, in response their stigmatized Tuqay Russophile. The same time Okhrana reported his poems as Russophobic. Also Tuqay became closer to the first Tatar Marxist, X√∂s√§yen Yama≈üev. In June 1909 Y√§≈üen, was closed due to financial problems as well as censorship requirement, as well as √Ñl- ƒ∞slax. Being at the top of his crisis, he thinks about suicide, but since March 1910 a new satirical magazine, Yal-Yolt (The Lightning) was published in Kazan under √Ñxm√§t Urman√ßiev. Being interested in Leo Tolstoy ideas and legacy, Tuqay felt keenly the death of the Russian genius. Pointing out a high role of children's education, he prepared two books for children, and two schoolbooks of Tatar literature. In total, he composed more than fifty verses and seven poems for children. = Ufa - Saint-Petersburg - Troitsk = In 1911 Qadimist forces allied with Okhrana fulminated ƒ∞j-Bub√≠, the most progressive Tatar madrassah. This fact filled with indignation all Tatar intelligentsia. But it was only a beginning of campaign drive against Tatar democracy, which became Tuqay's tragedy again. However, as it known from Tuqay's letters to his friend S√§ƒüit S√∂n√ß√§l√§y, he decided to write the Tatar Eugene Onegin, but he had to recover his health. He planned a trip to the southern regions to receive kumiss therapy there. In April he left Kazan and had a voyage by the Volga to Astrakhan. There he met R√§miev and became reconciled with him. Three weeks later he moved to Kalmyk Bazary village and stayed with schoolteacher ≈ûahit ƒû√§yfi there. As ƒû√§yfi was interested in photography, they shot a series of cards, devoted to Tuqay's poems and the Tatar theatre. Returning to Kazan, he published, Mi√§wbik√§ (Pussycat), his prominent poem for children. There he applied new poetic methods, and was criticized therefore. He also was interested to publish his prohibited verses in the newspaper of the Russian Muslims, published in Paris, but later he refused of this idea, as the newspaper propagated pan-Islamist ideas. In autumn 1911 a famine stroke Idel- Ural. The Autumn Wind was devoted to the famine and hard lot of peasantry. Tuqay felt ill with malaria and unfortunately moved to cold hotel number. So, he abandoned all and moved to √ñ√ßile, to his relatives. There he passed winter, writing o recomposing his verses, sometimes sending new feuilletons to the editors. Possible, another reason of his departure was a trial of his book, published as early as in 1907. He returned in February 1912. In March 1912 his friend, Yama≈üev dead of infarction and Tuqay devoted a feeling poem (X√∂rm√§tle X√∂s√§yen y√§dk√¢re, i.e. Of Blessed Memory of X√∂s√§yen) to the first Tatar Marxist. In April ƒûabdulla Tuqay went on a tour again. First he arrived to Ufa, where he met Majit Ghafuri. Then he left Ufa and moved to Saint- Petersburg. He stayed with Musa Bigiev. In Saint Petersburg he met with local Tatar diaspora's youth, many of whom were students and leftist activists. The impression of them is expressed in The Tatar Youth (Tatar y√§≈ül√§re) verse, full of optimism. However, he didn't know that he has the last stage of tuberculosis: a doctor, examined him in Saint Petersburg, preferred to keep diagnosis back. He was advised to take a course in Switzerland, but he refused and after farewell party moved to Ufa again, and then to Troitsk. There he lived till July 1912 among the Kazakh nomads in the steppe, receiving kumiss therapy. =Death= His last year he began full of optimism: the revolutionary tendencies rose, and social theme appeared in his poetry again. In A√± (The Consciousness) and Dahig√§ (To the Genius) he wrote that his struggle, as well as the 1905 revolution, was not vain. Many verses were devoted to the peasantry's problems, resembling Nekrasov's poetry. More and more verses were banned; some of them were only published after the October Revolution. However, Tuqay was criticized by ƒû√§limcan ƒ∞brahimov, that now his poetry worsened. In summer 1912 he published his last book, The Mental Food, a collection of 43 verses and one poem. But then his health deteriorated. In spite of this, he found energy to write for the new literature magazine A√± and the democratic newspaper Qoya≈ü (The Sun), edited by Fatix √Ñmirxan. As √Ñmirxan was paralyzed, they stayed in neighboring rooms of the Amur Hotel, where the editorial board was situated. In the first days of 1913 he wrote The Frost, a witty poem depicting how Kazaners of different social classes behave during frost. The next notable poem was devoted to the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. The poem was rather panegyrical, as was the vulgar- sociological critique of the early 1920s, based on this poem, proclaimed Tuqay to be a pan-Islamist and Tsarist. However, the end of the verse is written not about Tsar's dynasty, but about internationalism within Russian and eternal friendship of Tatars and Russians. On 26 February 1913, ƒûabdulla Tuqay was hospitalized due to a severe case of tuberculosis. Even in the Klyachkinskaya hospital he never stopped writing poems for Tatar newspapers and magazines. Those poems were both social and philosophical. In March he wrote his literary testament, The First Deed after the Awakening. In hospital Tuqay became interested in Tolstoy's legacy again, devoting to him two verses. He read more about Volga Bulgaria‚Äôs history as well as all Kazan periods. On 15 April of the same year, ƒûabdulla Tuqay died at the age of 27 and was buried in Tatar cemetery. Legacy Despite of denial of Tuqay's genius during the early Soviet years, he soon became renowned as the greatest Tatar poet. His name transcended across the arts, with the Tatar State Symphony Orchestra dedicated to Tuqay's name. During the Soviet rule his most cited were his social poems, whereas now the most popular are poems about Tatarstan nature, Tatar national culture, music, history and, of course, the Tatar language. 26 April, his birthday, is celebrated as The Day of Tatar Language, and his poem ƒ∞, Tuƒüan tel (Oh My Mother Tongue!) is the unofficial hymn of the Tatar language. =Excerpt, \\"Oh My Mother Tongue!\\"Tuqay, ƒûabdulla, and Sabƒ±rcan Badretdin, trans. http://kitapxane.noka.ru/authors/tuqay/oh_my_mothir_tongui = : :Oh, beloved native language :Oh, enchanting mother tongue! :You enabled my search for knowledge :Of the world, since I was young :As a child, when I was sleepless :Mother sung me lullabies :And my grandma told me stories :Through the night, to shut my eyes :Oh, my tongue!

For his leadership during World War II he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union twice. He died from wounds received outside K√∂nigsberg at age 37 while in command of the 3rd Belorussian Front. Early life Ivan Chernyakhovsky was born in 1907. His father was a railwayman who died of typhus when his son was nine. He was a railway worker until joining the Red Army in 1924. In 1928 he finished the officer school in Kiev. Due to the rapid pre-war expansion of the military and 1937‚Äì1938 military purges, he quickly rose in rank. In 1938 he became commander of the 9th Light Tank Brigade. In March 1941 he became the commander of the 28th Tank Division in the Baltic Military District.  World War II  Chernyakhovsky in 1943 In June 1942 he was promoted to commander of the 18th Tank Corps defending Voronezh, and only a month later assumed command of the 60th Army. =Battle of Kursk= On 8 February 1943, elements of Chernyakhovsky's 60th Army hoisted a victorious Red Banner over the city of Kursk after a fast advance to the city from Voronezh, which was retaken some two weeks before. =Battles for Belarus= Chernyakhovsky and other members of his military council on the eve of the Battle of the Dnieper, 1943 Operation Bagration was launched after a four-month break in activities because of the spring thaw. The Soviets launched their attack on June 22 on four fronts with 146 infantry and 43 armored divisions. General Bagramyan's 1st Baltic Front and General Chernyakhovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front struck to the north and south of Vitebsk and took the city on June 27. Chernyakhovsky's left wing then took Orsha ‚Äì this meant that the Moscow‚ÄìMinsk highway could now be used to threaten the German rear. To the south, General Zakharov's 2nd Belorussian Front, north of the Pripet Marshes, destroyed a force of 70,000 at Babruysk on that day. Chernyakhovsky's army now headed for Minsk. On July 2 his mobile forces reached Stolbtsy within pre-war borders of Poland, 40 miles away. General Rotmistrov's tanks entered Minsk on 3 July and 100,000 Germans were trapped. The offensive pressed on to Baranavichy (8 July) and to Grodno (13 July). In the south Rokossovsky cleared the Pripet Marshes taking Pinsk and Kovel on 5 July. In the north Bagramyan turned to the Baltic States and took Vilnius in Lithuania and Daugavpils in Latvia on 13 July. This split the Army Group North in two (East Prussia and the Baltic States). The Soviets arrived on the current Polish border within 24 days and, after 23 days, claimed to have taken 158,000 men, 2,000 tanks, 10,000 guns, and 57,000 motor vehicles. They also claimed to have killed 381,000 Germans. It was a resounding defeat for the Germans and Hitler dismissed Busch from the command of Army Group Centre, replacing him with Model. The Soviets had swept the Germans from Belorussia by mid-July 1944 and they pressed their advantage by attacking Poland. In the north Generals Chernyakhovsky and Zakharov joined to take Bia≈Çystok on 18 July. =Arrest of Polish anti-Nazi resistance in Vilnius= Chernyakhovsky in 1944 On 17 July 1944, as part of a covert operation aimed at disarming Armia Krajowa (AK), Chernyakhovsky, along with the General Ivan Serov, sent by the NKVD, held talks with the leadership of the Wilno Branch of the AK. Under the false pretenses of discussing the further fight against the Nazis, Polish resistance officers were invited to a briefing in the headquarters of the Belarusian People's Front. The meeting was attended by Polish resistance officers Lieutenant Colonel Aleksander Krzy≈ºanowski, nom de guerre \\"Wolf\\", and the Chief of Staff Major Teodor Cetys, codename \\"Fame\\". Both were immediately disarmed and arrested. On the same day in the village of Bogusze, a similar meeting was announced to brief commanders of other Polish partisan units in the presence of both Krzy≈ºanowski and Chernyakhovsky. However the 'briefing' ended with the disarming and arrest of the Polish officers by the NKVD. In this period, up to 8,000 Polish resistance fighters were arrested. They were either press-ganged into the Soviet Army, sent to the Gulag, or executed. =In Germany= Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Chernyakhovsky interrogate a captured Wehrmacht general in Germany, 1944 In summer 1944 General Chernyakhovsky pressed the Germans on the frontiers of their own land in East Prussia. His 3rd Belorussian Front drove across the Neman River, taking Kaunas on 1 August, and pressed the eastern border of East Prussia. The center thrust took Suwalki on July 26 and General Bagramyan occupied the Tukums junction on the Gulf of Riga. Prior to his death in 1945, Chernyakhovsky launched the Soviet East Prussian Offensive against stiff resistance from the 3rd Panzer Army. He was part of the drive on Berlin. Together with Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front, which attacked East Prussia from the south and then headed north-westwards towards the Baltic coast around Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), the 3rd Belorussian Front, commanded by General Chernyakhovsky was ordered to attack from the east towards K√∂nigsberg, even though this meant throwing his armies against heavy German defence works. These two fronts mustered 1,670,000 men with 28,360 guns and heavy mortars and 3,300 tanks. Marshal Rokossovsky's front made contact with Marshal Zhukov's forces at Grudziadz (German: Graudenz) and they wheeled north towards Danzig to cut off East Prussia. More than 500,000 Germans were caught in a pocket, but many were evacuated. On 10 February, Rokossovsky reached the coast near Elbing (ElblƒÖg) and East Prussia was under siege from the south and east by the 3rd Byelorussian Front. From January 1945 until his death, he served as the Soviet Supreme Commander of East Prussia. On 1 February Chernyakhovsky split the pocket by attacking between Elbing and K√∂nigsberg. Just over two weeks later, on 18 February he was killed by shell fragments from artillery fire while inspecting preparations for an offensive. Legacy Chernyakhovsky was buried in Vilnius, Lithuania, near a square named in his honor. After Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 and following the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991, Chernyakhovsky's remains were reburied at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow in 1992. A monument to Chernyakhovsky, dismantled by the authorities of Vilnius, was reinstated in the Russian city of Voronezh that was defended in the fall of 1942 and liberated in January 1943 by the 60th Army under his command. After World War II, when the Soviet Union due to Potsdam Agreement annexed northern East Prussia and expelled the Germans, the town of Insterburg was renamed Chernyakhovsk in his honor. In September 2015, a statue of Chernyakhovsky erected after the war in Pieniƒô≈ºno, Poland (former German name: Mehlsack), near where he was killed, was removed by local Polish authorities, prompting protests from the Russian government.\\"Russia summons Polish ambassador to protest removal of Soviet era statue\\", Yahoo News, 18 September 2015 In 2013, the Ivan Chernyakhovsky National Defense University of Ukraine was named in his honor.–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –≤—ñ–¥ 22 –ª—é—Ç–æ–≥–æ 2013 —Ä–æ–∫—É ‚Ññ 85/2013 ¬´–ü—Ä–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Å–≤–æ—î–Ω–Ω—è —ñ–º–µ–Ω—ñ –Ü–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ß–µ—Ä–Ω—è—Ö–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º—É —É–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—É –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏¬ª.

Early life and career Brockway was born to W. G. Brockway and Frances Elizabeth Abbey in Calcutta, British India. While attending the School for the Sons of Missionaries, then in Blackheath, London (now Eltham College) from 1897 to 1905 he developed an interest in politics. In 1908 Brockway became a vegetarian. Several decades later, during a debate in a House of Lords on animal cruelty, he said: 'I am a vegetarian and I have been so for 70 years. On the whole, I think, physically I am a pretty good advertisement for that practice.' After leaving school he worked as a journalist for newspapers and journals including The Quiver, the Daily News and the Christian Commonwealth. In 1907, Brockway joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and was a regular visitor to the Fabian Society. He was appointed editor of the Labour Leader (the newspaper of the ILP, later called the New Leader) and was, by 1913, a committed pacifist. He opposed sending troops to France during the First World War and, through his position as editor of the Labour Leader, was outspoken in his views about the conflict. On 12 November 1914 he published an appeal for men of military age to join him in forming the No-Conscription Fellowship to campaign against the possibility of the government attempting to introduce conscription in Britain. Brockway acknowledged his wife, Lila Brockway, had the foresight 'that those who intended to refuse military service should band themselves together'. Lila acted as provisional secretary at their cottage in Derbyshire until the beginning of 1915, when the membership had grown so large that it had become necessary to open an office in London. In London, Catherine Marshall became the Fellowship's political secretary since she was adept at political strategy as the Parliamentary Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. The No-Conscription Fellowship produced a weekly newspaper The Tribunal that was suppressed; through the activity of Joan Beauchamp it continued production although her refusal to divulge the name of the printer caused her to be charged with contempt of court and held in custody for 10 days.The offices of the Labour Leader were raided in August 1915 and Brockway was charged with publishing seditious material. He pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in court. In 1916 Brockway was again arrested, this time for distributing anti-conscription leaflets. He was fined, and after refusing to pay the fine, was sent to Pentonville Prison for two months. Shortly after his release Brockway was arrested for a third time for his refusal to be conscripted, after being denied recognition as a conscientious objector. He was handed over to the Army and court-martialled for disobeying orders. As if a traitor, he was held for a night in the Tower of London, in a dungeon under Chester Castle and in Walton Prison, Liverpool, where he edited an unofficial newspaper, the Walton Leader for conscientious objectors in the prison. This led to his being disciplined, which in turn led to a 10-day prison strike by conscientious objectors before he was transferred to Lincoln Jail, where he spent some time in solitary confinement until finally released in 1919. In October 1950 he revisited the jail with √âamon de Valera, the Irish statesman.Lincolnshire Echo, 9 October 1950. Following his release he became an active member of the India League, which advocated Indian independence. He became secretary of the ILP in 1923 and later its chairman. Years later, the Government of India honoured him with the third highest civilian award of the Padma Bhushan in 1989. Political activities, 1924‚Äì35 Brockway stood for Parliament several times, including at Lancaster in 1922 and against Winston Churchill at Westminster Abbey in a 1924 by-election. In 1926, he became the first chairperson of War Resisters' International, serving in this post until 1934. Brockway was a member of the League against Imperialism created in Brussels in 1927. At the 1929 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Leyton East as a Labour Party candidate. He polled 11,111 votes and, immediately after the election, the Liberal candidate announced that Brockway had converted him to socialism. His convictions brought him into difficulties with the Labour Party. He was also outspoken in Parliament, and was once \\"named\\" (suspended) by the Speaker while demanding a debate on India at Prime Minister's Question Time.The Manchester Guardian 18 July 1930, page 11 In 1931 Brockway lost his seat and the following year he disaffiliated from the Labour Party along with the rest of the ILP. He stood unsuccessfully for the ILP in the 1934 Upton by-election (Upton was a division of West Ham), placed a remote third with only a 3.5% share of the votes cast, and in Norwich in the 1935 election. He also wrote a book on the arms trade, The Bloody Traffic, published by Gollancz Ltd in 1934. According to David Howell, after 1932 Brockway \\"sought to articulate a socialism distinct from the pragmatism of Labour and the Stalinism of the Communist Party\\".David Howell, \\"Brockway, (Archibald) Fenner, Baron Brockway\\" in H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (eds.) Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: From the earliest times to the year 2000. (Volume Seven, pp. 765-6) In Brockway's science fiction novel, Purple Plague (1935), a sea liner is quarantined for a decade as a result of a plague. An egalitarian society emerges. Spanish Civil War Despite his previous pacifist commitment, he resigned from War Resisters' International, explaining: He assisted in the recruitment of British volunteers to fight the fascist forces of Francisco Franco in Spain through the ILP Contingent. He sailed to Calais in Feb 1937 and was believed to have been destined for Spain.National Archive; Spanish Civil War files Among those who went to Spain was Eric Blair (better known as George Orwell) and it is known that Brockway wrote a letter of recommendation for Blair to present to the ILP representatives in Barcelona. Following the Spanish Civil War, he advocated public understanding of the conflict. He wrote a number of articles about the conflict and was influential in getting Orwell's Homage to Catalonia published.Spartacus Educational: Fenner Brockway profile Notwithstanding his support for British participation in the Second World War, he served as Chair of the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors throughout the war, and continued to serve as Chair until his death.Kramer, Ann, Conscientious Objectors of the Second World War, Barnsley, Pen & Sword Books, 2013 He also sought to re-enter Parliament, unsuccessfully contesting wartime by-elections for the ILP at Lancaster in 1941 and Cardiff East in 1942. After the Second World War In May 1946, Brockway toured the British occupation zone in Germany as an accredited war correspondent, meeting German socialists and reporting on living conditions there; he wrote about the visit in German Diary, published by the Left Book Club. Brockway later rejoined the Labour Party. After the 1950 general election he returned to the House of Commons, following an absence of nearly 20 years, as the MP for Eton and Slough. In 1951, he was one of the four founders of the charity War on Want, which fights global poverty. He helped establish the Congress of Peoples Against Imperialism (est. 1945), an organisation he continued to work with throughout the 1950s. His activities there included protesting against the response of the government to the Mau Mau Uprising in the British Kenya Colony. In this area, he was a part of the larger Movement for Colonial Freedom. From the late 1950s he regularly proposed legislation in Parliament to ban racial discrimination, only to be defeated each time. He strongly opposed the use or possession of nuclear weapons by any nation and was a founding member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. On 18 July 1961, Brockway was chosen by Speaker Harry Hylton-Foster to ask the first question at the very first Prime Minister's Questions in the current format. Brockway was a prominent member of the British Humanist Association and South Place Ethical Society where he became an Appointed Lecturer during the 1960s. He gave the 1986 Conway Memorial Lecture on 21 May 1986. The Lecture was titled M D Conway: His Life and Message For Today and was chaired by Michael Foot. The Brockway Room at Conway Hall in London is named after him. House of Lords He narrowly lost his seat in the House of Commons at the 1964 election, despite the national swing to Labour at that election, as he was portrayed by his opponents as being the principal cause of immigrants from the West Indies settling in Slough.Bob Armstrong, Labour Party Aid to Fenner in the 1964 election He subsequently was created a life peer on 17 December 1964 taking the title Baron Brockway, of Eton and of Slough in the County of Buckingham, and took a seat in the House of Lords. Statue of Fenner Brockway in Red Lion Square near Grays Inn Road, London Last years Brockway continued to campaign for world peace and was for several years the chairman of the Movement for Colonial Freedom. Other important posts held by him include the Presidency of the British Council for Peace in Vietnam, and membership of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association. The World Disarmament Campaign was founded by Brockway in 1979, together with Philip Noel-Baker, to work for the implementation of the policies agreed at the 1978 Special Session on Disarmament of the UN General Assembly. Brockway died on 28 April 1988, aged 99. He was some six months shy of his centenary. Brockway had been twice married: firstly in 1914 (divorced 1945) to Lilla, daughter of the Rev. W. Harvey-Smith; secondly in 1946 to Edith Violet King. By his first marriage, he had four daughters, and by his second, he had a son.Contemporary Authors: A Bio-bibliographical guide to current writers, Ann Evory, Pamela Dear, Gale Group, 2000, pg 10Biographical Dictionary of European Labour Leaders, ed.

A statue of Brockway stands at the entrance to Red Lion Square Park in Holborn, London; it was funded by many involved in the Commonwealth independence movements he supported and was expected to be unveiled after his death. However, he achieved such longevity that it was likely that the original Planning Permission to erect it would run out, causing problems to renew the process. It was decided to ask him to unveil it, he being one of the few private individuals, as opposed to Heads of State to do so. It was damaged (an arm was broken off) by a falling tree in the Great Storm of 1987. The refurbished and insured statue was installed shortly after his death. A close in the town of Newport in southern Wales is named after him.

The membrane potential amplifier measures membrane voltage and sends output to the feedback amplifier; this subtracts the membrane voltage from the command voltage, which it receives from the signal generator. This signal is amplified and output is sent into the axon via the current-passing electrode. The voltage clamp is an experimental method used by electrophysiologists to measure the ion currents through the membranes of excitable cells, such as neurons, while holding the membrane voltage at a set level. A basic voltage clamp will iteratively measure the membrane potential, and then change the membrane potential (voltage) to a desired value by adding the necessary current. This \\"clamps\\" the cell membrane at a desired constant voltage, allowing the voltage clamp to record what currents are delivered. Because the currents applied to the cell must be equal to (and opposite in charge to) the current going across the cell membrane at the set voltage, the recorded currents indicate how the cell reacts to changes in membrane potential. Cell membranes of excitable cells contain many different kinds of ion channels, some of which are voltage-gated. The voltage clamp allows the membrane voltage to be manipulated independently of the ionic currents, allowing the current‚Äìvoltage relationships of membrane channels to be studied. History The concept of the voltage clamp is attributed to Kenneth Cole and George Marmont in the spring of 1947.Andrew Huxley, 1996, \\"Kenneth Sterward Cole 1900 ‚Äì 1984, A biographical Memoir\\" National Academy of Sciences. (Washington D.C.) They inserted an internal electrode into the giant axon of a squid and began to apply a current. Cole discovered that it was possible to use two electrodes and a feedback circuit to keep the cell's membrane potential at a level set by the experimenter. Cole developed the voltage clamp technique before the era of microelectrodes, so his two electrodes consisted of fine wires twisted around an insulating rod. Because this type of electrode could be inserted into only the largest cells, early electrophysiological experiments were conducted almost exclusively on squid axons. A personal photo of Kenneth Cole, given to Dr. J. Walter Woodbury Squids squirt jets of water when they need to move quickly, as when escaping a predator. To make this escape as fast as possible, they have an axon that can reach 1 mm in diameter (signals propagate more quickly down large axons). The squid giant axon was the first preparation that could be used to voltage clamp a transmembrane current, and it was the basis of Hodgkin and Huxley's pioneering experiments on the properties of the action potential. Alan Hodgkin realized that, to understand ion flux across the membrane, it was necessary to eliminate differences in membrane potential. Using experiments with the voltage clamp, Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley published 5 papers in the summer of 1952 describing how ionic currents give rise to the action potential.Vandenberg, J. I. and S. G. Waxman (2012). \\"Hodgkin and Huxley and the basis for electrical signalling: a remarkable legacy still going strong.\\" J. Physiol. (Oxford, U. K.) 590(11): 2569‚Äì2570. The final paper proposed the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model which mathematically describes the action potential. The use of voltage clamps in their experiments to study and model the action potential in detail has laid the foundation for electrophysiology; for which they shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Technique The voltage clamp is a current generator. Transmembrane voltage is recorded through a \\"voltage electrode\\", relative to ground, and a \\"current electrode\\" passes current into the cell. The experimenter sets a \\"holding voltage\\", or \\"command potential\\", and the voltage clamp uses negative feedback to maintain the cell at this voltage. The electrodes are connected to an amplifier, which measures membrane potential and feeds the signal into a feedback amplifier. This amplifier also gets an input from the signal generator that determines the command potential, and it subtracts the membrane potential from the command potential (Vcommand ‚Äì Vm), magnifies any difference, and sends an output to the current electrode. Whenever the cell deviates from the holding voltage, the operational amplifier generates an \\"error signal\\", that is the difference between the command potential and the actual voltage of the cell. The feedback circuit passes current into the cell to reduce the error signal to zero. Thus, the clamp circuit produces a current equal and opposite to the ionic current. Variations of the voltage clamp technique = Two-electrode voltage clamp using microelectrodes = Two-electrode voltage clamp The two- electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique is used to study properties of membrane proteins, especially ion channels. Researchers use this method most commonly to investigate membrane structures expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The large size of these oocytes allows for easy handling and manipulability. The TEVC method utilizes two low-resistance pipettes, one sensing voltage and the other injecting current. The microelectrodes are filled with conductive solution and inserted into the cell to artificially control membrane potential. The membrane acts as a dielectric as well as a resistor, while the fluids on either side of the membrane function as capacitors. The microelectrodes compare the membrane potential against a command voltage, giving an accurate reproduction of the currents flowing across the membrane. Current readings can be used to analyze the electrical response of the cell to different applications. This technique is favored over single-microelectrode clamp or other voltage clamp techniques when conditions call for resolving large currents. The high current-passing capacity of the two-electrode clamp makes it possible to clamp large currents that are impossible to control with single-electrode patch techniques. The two-electrode system is also desirable for its fast clamp settling time and low noise. However, TEVC is limited in use with regard to cell size. It is effective in larger-diameter oocytes, but more difficult to use with small cells. Additionally, TEVC method is limited in that the transmitter of current must be contained in the pipette. It is not possible to manipulate the intracellular fluid while clamping, which is possible using patch clamp techniques. Another disadvantage involves \\"space clamp\\" issues. Cole's voltage clamp used a long wire that clamped the squid axon uniformly along its entire length. TEVC microelectrodes can provide only a spatial point source of current that may not uniformly affect all parts of an irregularly shaped cell.  Dual-cell voltage clamp  The dual-cell voltage clamp technique is a specialized variation of the two electrode voltage clamp, and is only used in the study of gap junction channels. Gap junctions are pores that directly link two cells through which ions and small molecules flow freely. When two cells in which gap junction proteins, typically connexins or innexins, are expressed, either endogenously or via injection of mRNA, a junction channel will form between the cells. Since two cells are present in the system, two sets of electrodes are used. A recording electrode and a current injecting electrode are inserted into each cell, and each cell is clamped individually (each set of electrodes is attached to a separate apparatus, and integration of data is performed by computer). To record junctional conductance, the current is varied in the first cell while the recording electrode in the second cell records any changes in Vm for the second cell only. (The process can be reversed with the stimulus occurring in the second cell and recording occurring in the first cell.) Since no variation in current is being induced by the electrode in the recorded cell, any change in voltage must be induced by current crossing into the recorded cell, through the gap junction channels, from the cell in which the current was varied. = Single-electrode voltage clamp = This category describes a set of techniques in which one electrode is used for voltage clamp. Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c) technique is often used with patch-clamp recording. Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) technique is used with penetrating intracellular recording. This single electrode carries out the functions of both current injection and voltage recording.  Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c)  The \\"patch-clamp\\" technique allows the study of individual ion channels. It uses an electrode with a relatively large tip (> 1 micrometer) that has a smooth surface (rather than a sharp tip). This is a \\"patch-clamp electrode\\" (as distinct from a \\"sharp electrode\\" used to impale cells). This electrode is pressed against a cell membrane and suction is applied to pull the cell's membrane inside the electrode tip. The suction causes the cell to form a tight seal with the electrode (a \\"gigaohm seal\\", as the resistance is more than a gigaohm). SEV-c has the advantage that you can record from small cells that would be impossible to impale with two electrodes. However: #Microelectrodes are imperfect conductors; in general, they have a resistance of more than a million ohms. They rectify (i.e., change their resistance with voltage, often in an irregular manner), they sometimes have unstable resistance if clogged by cell contents. Thus, they will not faithfully record the voltage of the cell, especially when it is changing quickly, nor will they faithfully pass current. #Voltage and current errors: SEV-c circuitry does not actually measure the voltage of the cell being clamped (as does a two-electrode clamp). The patch-clamp amplifier is like a two-electrode clamp, except the voltage measuring and current passing circuits are connected (in the two-electrode clamp, they are connected through the cell). The electrode is attached to a wire that contacts the current/voltage loop inside the amplifier. Thus, the electrode has only an indirect influence on the feedback circuit. The amplifier reads only the voltage at the top of the electrode, and feeds back current to compensate. But, if the electrode is an imperfect conductor, the clamp circuity has only a distorted view of the membrane potential. Likewise, when the circuit passes back current to compensate for that (distorted) voltage, the current will be distorted by the electrode before it reaches the cell. To compensate for this, the electrophysiologist uses the lowest resistance electrode possible, makes sure that the electrode characteristics do not change during an experiment (so the errors will be constant), and avoids recording currents with kinetics likely to be too fast for the clamp to follow accurately. The accuracy of SEV-c goes up the slower and smaller are the voltage changes it is trying to clamp. #Series resistance errors: The currents passed to the cell must go to ground to complete the circuit. The voltages are recorded by the amplifier relative to ground. When a cell is clamped at its natural resting potential, there is no problem; the clamp is not passing current and the voltage is being generated only by the cell. But, when clamping at a different potential, series resistance errors become a concern; the cell will pass current across its membrane in an attempt to return to its natural resting potential. The clamp amplifier opposes this by passing current to maintain the holding potential. A problem arises because the electrode is between the amplifier and the cell; i.e., the electrode is in series with the resistor that is the cell's membrane. Thus, when passing current through the electrode and the cell, Ohm's Law tells us that this will cause a voltage to form across both the cell's and the electrode's resistance. As these resistors are in series, the voltage drops will add. If the electrode and the cell membrane have equal resistances (which they usually do not), and if the experimenter command a 40mV change from the resting potential, the amplifier will pass enough current until it reads that it has achieved that 40mV change. However, in this example, half of that voltage drop is across the electrode. The experimenter thinks he or she has moved the cell voltage by 40 mV, but has moved it only by 20 mV. The difference is the \\"series resistance error\\". Modern patch-clamp amplifiers have circuity to compensate for this error, but these compensate only 70-80% of it. The electrophysiologist can further reduce the error by recording at or near the cell's natural resting potential, and by using as low a resistance electrode as possible. #Capacitance errors. Microelectrodes are capacitors, and are particularly troublesome because they are non-linear. The capacitance arises because the electrolyte inside the electrode is separated by an insulator (glass) from the solution outside. This is, by definition and function, a capacitor. Worse, as the thickness of the glass changes the farther you get from the tip, the time constant of the capacitor will vary. This produces a distorted record of membrane voltage or current whenever they are changing. Amplifiers can compensate for this, but not entirely because the capacitance has many time-constants. The experimenter can reduce the problem by keeping the cell's bathing solution shallow (exposing less glass surface to liquid) and by coating the electrode with silicone, resin, paint, or another substance that will increase the distance between the inside and outside solutions. #Space clamp errors. A single electrode is a point source of current. In distant parts of the cell, the current passed through the electrode will be less influential than at nearby parts of the cell. This is particularly a problem when recording from neurons with elaborate dendritic structures. There is nothing one can do about space clamp errors except to temper the conclusions of the experiment.  Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d)  A single-electrode voltage clamp -- discontinuous, or SEVC-d, has some advantages over SEVC-c for whole-cell recording. In this, a different approach is taken for passing current and recording voltage. A SEVC-d amplifier operates on a \\"time-sharing\\" basis, so the electrode regularly and frequently switches between passing current and measuring voltage. In effect, there are two electrodes, but each is in operation for only half of the time it is on. The oscillation between the two functions of the single electrode is termed a duty cycle. During each cycle, the amplifier measures the membrane potential and compares it with the holding potential. An operational amplifier measures the difference, and generates an error signal. This current is a mirror image of the current generated by the cell. The amplifier outputs feature sample and hold circuits, so each briefly sampled voltage is then held on the output until the next measurement in the next cycle. To be specific, the amplifier measures voltage in the first few microseconds of the cycle, generates the error signal, and spends the rest of the cycle passing current to reduce that error. At the start of the next cycle, voltage is measured again, a new error signal generated, current passed etc. The experimenter sets the cycle length, and it is possible to sample with periods as low as about 15 microseconds, corresponding to a 67 kHz switching frequency. Switching frequencies lower than about 10 kHz are not sufficient when working with action potentials that are less than 1 millisecond wide. Note that not all discontinuous voltage-clamp amplifier support switching frequencies higher than 10 kHz. For this to work, the cell capacitance must be higher than the electrode capacitance by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much less than that of the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the electrode voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle. SEVC-d has a major advantage over SEVC-c in allowing the experimenter to measure membrane potential, and, as it obviates passing current and measuring voltage at the same time, there is never a series resistance error. The main disadvantages are that the time resolution is limited and the amplifier is unstable. If it passes too much current, so that the goal voltage is over-shot, it reverses the polarity of the current in the next duty cycle. This causes it to undershoot the target voltage, so the next cycle reverses the polarity of the injected current again. This error can grow with each cycle until the amplifier oscillates out of control (‚Äúringing‚Äù); this usually results in the destruction of the cell being recorded. The investigator wants a short duty cycle to improve temporal resolution; the amplifier has adjustable compensators that will make the electrode voltage decay faster, but, if these are set too high the amplifier will ring, so the investigator is always trying to ‚Äútune‚Äù the amplifier as close to the edge of uncontrolled oscillation as possible, in which case small changes in recording conditions can cause ringing. There are two solutions: to ‚Äúback off‚Äù the amplifier settings into a safe range, or to be alert for signs that the amplifier is about to ring.

He is currently a professor of computer science at Yale University. He is a former national fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and senior fellow in Jewish thought at the Shalem Center, and sat on the National Endowment for the Arts. He publishes widely; his work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Los Angeles Times, The Weekly Standard, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and elsewhere. His paintings have been exhibited in New Haven and Manhattan. He is known for contributions to parallel computation and for books on topics including computed worlds (Mirror Worlds), and what he sees as the destructive influence of liberal academia on American society, expressed in his book America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats). In 1993 he was sent a mail bomb by Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, which almost killed him and left him with some permanent disabilities: he lost his right hand and his right eye was permanently damaged. Life and work David Gelernter's father was computer science professor Herbert Gelernter, who taught at Stony Brook University.\\"A Life That Made Sense,\\" by David Gelernter, The Weekly Standard, September 7, 2015, at 5. He received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in classical Hebrew literature from Yale University in 1976 and his Ph.D. from S.U.N.Y. Stony Brook in 1982. In the 1980s, he made seminal contributions to the field of parallel computation, specifically the tuple space coordination model, as embodied by the Linda programming system (named for Linda Lovelace, an actress in the porn movie Deep Throat, mocking Ada's tribute to the scientist and first attributed computer programmer, Ada Lovelace). Bill Joy cites Linda as the inspiration for many elements of JavaSpaces and Jini. On June 24, 1993, Gelernter was severely injured opening a mail bomb sent by the Unabomber. He recovered from his injuries, but his right hand and eye were permanently damaged. He chronicled the ordeal in his 1997 book Drawing Life: Surviving the Unabomber. He helped found the company Mirror Worlds Technologies, which in 2001 released Scopeware software using ideas from his 1992 book Mirror Worlds. Gelernter believed that computers can free users from being filing clerks by organizing their data. The company announced it would \\"cease operations effective May 15, 2004\\". On May 23, 2013, a related company Mirror Worlds, LLC filed a complaint of patent infringement against Apple Inc., Best Buy Co. Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard Co., Lenovo (United States) Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronic USA Inc, Samsung TeleCommunications America, LLC in the Texas Eastern District Court (case no. 6:2013cv00419). In August 2016, the case was dismissed with prejudice. The case has been considered by the Supreme Court of the United States but a petition for writ of certiorari was denied on June 24, 2013. In 2003, he became a member of the National Council on the Arts. Gelernter has critiqued what he perceives as cultural illiteracy among students. In 2015, he commented, \\"They [students] know nothing about art. They know nothing about history. They know nothing about philosophy. And because they have been raised as not even atheists, they don't rise to the level of atheists, insofar as they've never thought about the existence or nonexistence of God. It has never occurred to them. They know nothing about the Bible.\\" =Political views= Time Magazine profiled Gelernter in 2016, describing him as a \\"stubbornly independent thinker. A conservative among mostly liberal Ivy League professors, a religious believer among the often disbelieving ranks of computer scientists.\\" In October 2016, he wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal endorsing Donald Trump for President, calling Hillary Clinton \\"as phony as a three-dollar bill,\\" and saying that Barack Obama \\"has governed like a third-rate tyrant.\\" He has also argued for the U.S. voting age to be raised on the basis that 18-year-olds were not sufficiently mature. Gelernter contributes to magazines such as City Journal, The Weekly Standard, and Commentary which are generally considered neoconservative. For seven months, he contributed a weekly op-ed column to the LA Times. =Controversial positions on science= The Washington Post, profiling him in early 2017 as a potential science advisor to Donald Trump, called him \\"a vehement critic of modern academia\\" who has \\"condemned 'belligerent leftists' and blamed intellectualism for the disintegration of patriotism and traditional family values.\\". Shortly thereafter, The Atlantic published a rebuttal of the Washington Post profile, saying it was \\"hard to imagine a more misleading treatment\\" of the \\"pioneering polymath\\" Gelernter.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/theres-enough- time-to-change-everything/517209/ David Gelernter \\"expressed skepticism about the reality\\" of anthropogenic climate change. In July 2019, Gelernter challenged Darwin's theories. In a review of Stephen Meyer's book Darwin's Doubt, which he wrote for the Claremont Review of Books, Gelernter does not accept evolution \\"as Darwin presents it\\" On the other hand, Gelernter stipulates he \\"cannot accept\\" intelligent design either, saying that \\"as a theory, it would seem to have a long way to go.\\"https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/giving-up-darwin/ Book reviews A conversation with David Gelernter in 2010 Gelernter's book Mirror Worlds (1991) \\"prophesied the rise of the World Wide Web.\\"John Markoff, technology writer and New York Times reporter in an interview with David Gelernter Bill Joy, founder and Chief Scientist of Sun Microsystems, says Gelernter is \\"one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.\\" The New York Times called him a computer science \\"rock star\\".Schwartz, John. New Economy; Selling a Vision of the Future beyond Folders. NY Times, 7/2/01 In America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats), Gelernter argues that American higher education no longer cares about producing well-rounded and cultured students; academics instead believe their role is to dictate how other Americans live and think. Stephen Daisley wrote in Commentary magazine that Gelernter portrays Obama's presidency as a symbol of the failure of American education and the success of its replacement with a liberal indoctrination system. As a solution, Gelernter proposes moving all of human knowledge to online servers so that the in-person college experience can be replaced by user-driven self-education. Daisley wrote, \\"America-Lite is lean, incisive convincing, delightfully indelicate, and, in a break from the conventions of the literature on education, honest. It is a fine dissection‚Äîde-construction, if you must‚Äîof the corruption of higher education and the resulting debasement of political culture. If it makes its way on to a single college reading list, Hell will have frozen over.\\" Russell Jacoby was critical in his review of Gelernter's book America-Lite, feeling it contained insufficient arguments. Jacoby claimed that Gelernter blamed Jews for causing the breakdown of patriotism and the traditional family, writing \\"Gelernter is Jewish, and it is not likely that a non-Jew would airily argue that obnoxious leftist Jews have taken over elite higher education.\\" Selected works =Books= * With David Padua and Alexandru Nicolau.

The kamanchech is related to the rebab which is the historical ancestor of the kamancheh and the bowed Byzantine lyra. The strings are played with a variable-tension bow. It is widely used in the classical music of Iran, Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan with slight variations in the structure of the instrument. In 2017, the art of crafting and playing with Kamantcheh/Kamancha was included into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.  Name and etymology  The word \\"kamancheh\\" means \\"little bow\\" in Persian (k√¶man, bow, and -cheh, diminutive). The Turkish word kemen√ße is borrowed from Persian, with the pronunciation adapted to Turkish phonology. It also denotes a bowed string instrument, but the Turkish version differs significantly in structure and sound from the Persian kamancheh. There is also an instrument called kabak kemane literally \\"pumpkin-shaped bow instrument\\" used in Turkish music which is only slightly different from the Iranian kamancheh.  Structure  The kamancheh has a long neck including fingerboard which kamancheh maker shapes it as a truncated inverse cone for easy bow moving in down section, pegbox in both side of which four pegs are placed, and finial Traditionally kamanchehs had three silk strings, but modern instruments have four metal strings. Kamanchehs may have highly ornate inlays and elaborately carved ivory tuning pegs. The body has a long upper neck and a lower bowl-shaped resonating chamber made from a gourd or wood, usually covered with a membrane made from the skin of a lamb, goat or sometimes a fish, on which the bridge is set. From the bottom protrudes a spike to support the kamancheh while it is being played, hence in English, the instrument is sometimes called the spiked fiddle. It is played sitting down held like a cello though it is about the length of a viol. The end-pin can rest on the knee or thigh while the player is seated in a chair. Kamancheh is usually tuned like an ordinary violin (G, D, A, E).

Early years and education Harrington was born in Kennington, London, and his secondary education was at the Pimlico Comprehensive School and Tenison's School, both also in London. His further and higher education were at City of Westminster College of Further Education (1980‚Äì82), Polytechnic of North London (1982‚Äì85), Edinburgh's Telford College (1994‚Äì95), West London Technology Centre (1993), Kensington & Chelsea College (1992‚Äì93), College of the Distributive Trades (1991‚Äì93), University of Greenwich (1997‚Äì99) and the University of Northumbria (2011‚Äì14). He has described himself as a \\"life-long vegetarian and pagan\\".Anarcho-Green Nazis Ideological development and political position Although he first came to prominence as a leading member of the National Front in the 1980s, Patrick Harrington claims he has undergone substantial ideological change since he voted to disband the NF in 1989. In his profile on the Third Way website, he cites Rabbi Mayer Schiller as a particular influence on this development. Schiller is the subject of a biography on the Third Way website, although his role in the party is unclear. In an interview with Wayne John Sturgeon of Alternative Green magazine, Harrington said: > \\"I voted for the disbandment of the National Front in 1989 which I think > speaks for itself. Since that time I have worked with my Third Way > colleagues for harmony and progress in our country. There are aspects of my > involvement with the NF which I deeply regret.

Students argued that his presence made life intolerable for ethnic minority students. Harrington disputed this and insisted on his right to attend lectures. He obtained a court injunction to stop the picketing; the protestors, backed by their students' union, ignored this.Searchlight, June 1984 Two student leaders were sent to jail for 16 days for contempt of a court order preventing them from barring Harrington from college.The Times, 29 November 1984. In December 1984, Dr David MacDowall, the Polytechnic's director, resigned after pressure from the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) to make a complaint against Harrington for remarks he made in a radio interview. ILEA said the remarks were racist, which Harrington denied.The Times, 8 December 1984. In his resignation letter, MacDowall admitted that he had acted \\"in a totally fascistic manner\\" over the issue, and wished \\"all the picketing students the best of luck with their campaign\\".Nigel Copsey, Anti-Fascism in Britain (Macmillan 2000), p. 156 Harrington subsequently faced a college hearing for a television interview in which, in line with NF policy, he questioned the right of black people to citizenship.The Times, 15 December 1984, 19 December 1984. In January 1985, with final exams approaching, the students' union, Harrington and the Polytechnic administration agreed a deal in which all of Harrington's classes would be taught in an annexe away from the main building. His fellow students boycotted these lectures and many lecturers taught them informally.The Times, 8 January 1985. Harrington eventually graduated with a philosophy degree.For more detail on the Harrington/PNL affair see Copsey, Anti-Fascism in Britain, pp. 155‚Äì57 =Official National Front= In the late 1980s, the National Front underwent a schism. Harrington sided with the Political Soldier group that included Nick Griffin (who later became leader of the British National Party) and Derek Holland. This group eventually termed itself the Official National Front. The ideas of Harrington and his allies led to alienation of some NF supporters with the Flag Group splitting off to follow more traditional NF ideas.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 45 Harrington was involved in one of the manifestations of these divisions in the 1989 Vauxhall by-election when, as a candidate, one of his opponents was Ted Budden of the Flag Group. In September 1988, the three men visited Libya as a guest of the Gaddafi regime. In October, the Political Soldier NF was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, Disciples of Chaos in which Harrington was interviewed.https://interestingfilms.co.uk/productions/disciples-of-chaos/ There was another schism in 1989 when Harrington and Graham Williamson parted company with Griffin and Holland. The ONF had opened dialogue with groups like the Nation of Islam and the Pan-Afrikan International Movement. According to Harrington's account of the split, when he opened discussion with Jewish nationalist and anti- Zionisthttps://archive.is/20130213141127/http://www.thirdway.eu/2008/01/30/judaism- and-nationalism/ rabbi Mayer Schiller (see section on Harrington's ideological development below) and advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, he was attacked as a \\"Zionist\\". Harrington and Williamson attended pro-Palestinian demonstrations such as the 1988 Quds Day march in London, as part of an ONF strategy to show support for Muslim anti- Zionists.Cheles, Ferguson & Vaughan, Neo-Fascism in Europe p.260 For their part, Griffin and Holland claimed that Harrington's refusal to condemn the IRA had been the cause of many problems.Searchlight, February 1990 Party members in Ulster sided with Harrington. In late 1989, Harrington voted for the disbandment of the Official National Front and joined with others to form the Third Way in 1990. Griffin and Holland formed the International Third Position. Later Griffin left this group and joined the BNP. =Relationship with Skrewdriver/Blood & Honour= As an official of the NF, Harrington was involved in administering the White Noise Club, which organised white power music concerts featuring, among others, Skrewdriver. In 1987, the Political Soldier group fell out with Ian Stuart, the lead singer of Skrewdriver. Stuart responded by setting up his own group, Blood & Honour, whose eponymous publication openly attacked his former NF associates. They in turn denounced Stuart. Harrington and Holland are allegedly the subjects of the Skrewdriver song \\"A Time of Change\\", included on their 1988 album After the Fire.Searchlight, February 1988. =Allegations of links with state security= In February 1990, Searchlight magazine alleged that Harrington had ongoing connections to Special Branch and MI6. Harrington has denied any such links. =Connection to Nick Griffin and the BNP= Harrington has had previous links with Nick Griffin and has provided legal services in the past to the British National Party, but he denies that these associations imply ideological agreement. He worked for Nick Griffin as a European Parliamentary local assistant during the MEP's term of office. In September 2005, he edited, and Third Way published, a pamphlet entitled Taking Liberties, with an article by Griffin. In the editorial Harrington wrote, \\"Let me nail my colours to the mast. I believe that speech (and other forms of expression) should be protected regardless of content or viewpoint. I am against any law that seeks to discriminate against any religious, racial or political group. I'm also against any law that favours one such interest group over another.\\" Harrington defends his decision to publish an article from Griffin on civil liberties grounds. His role as general secretary of Solidarity, and its association with the BNP, is discussed above. =Change in position?= Harrington has argued that he has moved away from many of his previous positions. Before the 2019 general election, he told members of Solidarity that he would be voting Labour, and wrote, \\"[L]ooking at the domestic economy and rights for workers Labour's promises are unmatched. I want to see re-Nationalisation and I want to see attacks on the rights of ordinary workers reversed. I want ordinary people to have more control over their working lives.\\"\\"Unions line up behind Labour Manifesto\\", Solidarity website, 25 November 2019. Retrieved 17 December 2019. After the election, Harrington stated, \\"I made it clear during the election campaign that I, as an individual, supported and would vote Labour because of the pro-worker policies in their manifesto. I always feared, however, that the many fine domestic policy offerings from Labour, which I as someone left-leaning, pro-union and pro-worker approved of, would be overshadowed by Brexit.\\"\\"Unions tell Labour it got it wrong and it's time to move on from Remain\\", Solidarity website, 17 December 2019.

He is best known for his 1971 novel Grendel, a retelling of the Beowulf myth from the monster's point of view. Early life and education Gardner was born in Batavia, New York. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught English at a local school. Both parents were fond of Shakespeare and often recited literature together. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank. As a child, Gardner attended public school and worked on his father's farm, where, in April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a cultipacker. Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother's death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks. The incident informed much of Gardner's fiction and criticism ‚Äî most directly in the 1977 short story \\"Redemption,\\" which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration. Gardner began his university education at DePauw University, but received his undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1955. He received his M.A. (1956) and Ph.D. (1958) from the University of Iowa.Gardner, John Champlin, Jr. He was Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Detroit in 1970.John C. Gardner Appreciation Page Fiction Gardner's best-known novels include The Sunlight Dialogues, about a disaffected policeman asked to engage a madman fluent in classical mythology; Grendel, a retelling of the Beowulf legend from the monster's point of view, with an existential subtext; and October Light, about an embittered brother and sister living and feuding with each other in rural Vermont (the novel includes an invented \\"trashy novel\\" that the woman reads). This last book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976.October Light - Fiction Award Winners Teaching and controversies Gardner was a lifelong teacher of fiction writing. He was associated with the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference. His two books on the craft of writing fiction‚ÄîThe Art of Fiction and On Becoming a Novelist‚Äîare considered classics. He was famously obsessive with his work, and acquired a reputation for advanced craft, smooth rhythms, and careful attention to the continuity of the fictive dream. His books nearly always touched on the redemptive power of art. In 1978, Gardner's book of literary criticism, On Moral Fiction, sparked a controversy that excited the mainstream media, vaulting Gardner into the spotlight with an interview on The Dick Cavett Show (May 16, 1978) and a cover story in The New York Times Magazine (July, 1979).John Gardner, Pugilist at Rest His judgments of contemporary authors‚Äîincluding such luminaries of American fiction as John Updike and John Barth‚Äîharmed his reputation among fellow writers and book reviewers. Gardner claimed that lingering animosity from critics of this book led to unflattering reviews of what turned out to be his last finished novel, Mickelsson's Ghosts, although literary critics later praised the book. Gore Vidal found the book, as well as Gardner's novels, sanctimonious and pedantic, and called Gardner the \\"late apostle to the lowbrows, a sort of Christian evangelical who saw Heaven as a paradigmatic American university.\\"Vidal, Gore (1986) \\"Calvino's Death.\\" From The Essential Gore Vidal. Gardner inspired and, according to Raymond Carver, sometimes intimidated his students. At Chico State College (where he taught from 1959 to 1962), when Carver mentioned to Gardner that he had not liked the assigned short story, Robert Penn Warren's \\"Blackberry Winter,\\" Gardner said, \\"You'd better read it again.\\" \\"And he wasn't joking\\", said Carver, who related this anecdote in his foreword to Gardner's book On Becoming a Novelist. In that foreword, he makes it clear how much he respected Gardner and also relates his kindness as a writing mentor. In addition to Chico State, Gardner taught at Oberlin College (1958-1959), San Francisco State College (1962-1965), Southern Illinois University Carbondale (1965-1974) and Binghamton University (1976-1982).The Twenty - Five Things That Made Genesee County Famous: John Gardner Scholarship In 1977, Gardner published The Life and Times of Chaucer. In a review in the October 1977 issue of Speculum, Sumner J. Ferris pointed to several passages that were allegedly lifted either in whole or in part from work by other authors without proper citation. Ferris charitably suggested that Gardner had published the book too hastily, but on April 10, 1978, reviewer Peter Prescott, writing in Newsweek, cited the Speculum article and accused Gardner of plagiarism, a claim that Gardner met \\"with a sigh.\\"John Gardner, The Art of Fiction No. 73 He is associated with a truism that holds that, in literature, only two plots exist: someone taking a journey, or a stranger arriving in town. However, Gardner's documented words on the subject, from The Art of Fiction, were simply exercise instructions to \\"use either a trip or the arrival of a stranger (some disruption of order‚Äîthe usual novel beginning).\\" Family life Gardner married Joan Louise Patterson on June 6, 1953; the marriage, which produced children, ended in divorce in 1980. Gardner married poet and novelist Liz Rosenberg in 1980; this marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Death Gardner was killed in a motorcycle accident about two miles from his home in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, September 14, 1982. State Police said that at about 2:30 pm Gardner completed a curve on Route 92 about north of Oakland (41.986246, -75.601200). Passing the home of photographer John Wood, he lost control of his 1979 Harley- Davidson, went into the dirt shoulder, struck the guard rail, and was thrown from the motorcycle, suffering blunt force trauma to his body from his handlebars. He was pronounced dead at Barnes-Kasson Hospital in Susquehanna. Gardner's fianc√©e, Susan Thornton, stated that Gardner had been drinking the night before the accident.Thornton, Susan. On Broken Glass: Loving and Losing John Gardner. New York: Da Capo Press, 2000, p. 282. An autopsy revealed Gardner had a blood alcohol level of 0.075; the legal limit for driving at the time was 0.08. Thornton also mentioned exhaustion from overwork as a contributing factor, and that the curve on Route 92 had been freshly-oiled gravel. The crash was four days before his planned marriage to Thornton. He was buried next to his brother Gilbert in Batavia's Grandview Cemetery. Works =Fiction= * The Resurrection.

The front of the mock-Tudor designed six bedroom house. Contained a screening room, glassed-in sun porch, bowling alley, and billiard room. Pickfair was an estate in the city of Beverly Hills, California, originally designed by architect Horatio Cogswell for attorney Lee Allen Phillips of Berkeley Square as a country home. Phillips sold the property to actor Douglas Fairbanks in 1918.Berkeley Square Los Angeles Coined \\"Pickfair\\" by the press, it became one of the most celebrated houses in the world. Life Magazine described Pickfair as \\"a gathering place only slightly less important than the White House... and much more fun.\\"  History  Located at 1143 Summit Drive in San Ysidro Canyon in Beverly Hills, the property was a hunting lodge when purchased by Fairbanks in 1919 for his bride-to-be, Mary Pickford. In the 1920s, the newlyweds extensively renovated the lodge, transforming it into a four-story, 25-room mansion complete with stables, servants quarters, tennis courts, a large guest wing, and garages. Remodeled by Wallace Neff in a mock Tudor style, it took five years to complete. Ceiling frescos, parquet flooring, wood paneled halls of fine mahogany and bleached pine, gold leaf and mirrored decorative niches, all added to the authentic charm of Pickfair. The property was said to have been the first private home in the Los Angeles area to include an in-ground swimming pool, in which Pickford and Fairbanks were famously photographed paddling a canoe. Pickfair featured a collection of early 18th-century English and French period furniture, decorative arts and antiques. Notable pieces in the collection included furniture from the Barberini Palace, the Baroness Burdett-Coutts estate in London, and Louis XVI furniture from the Countess Rodezno and Lord Leverhulme collections. The highlight of any visit to Pickfair was a large collection of Chinese objets d'art collected by Fairbanks and Pickford on their many visits to the Orient. The Pickfair art collection was wide and varied and included paintings by Philip Mercier, Guillaume Seignac, George Romney, and Paul de Longpr√©. The mansion also featured an Old West style saloon complete with an ornate burnished mahogany bar obtained from a saloon in Auburn, California, as well as paintings by Frederic Remington. In the 1970 Volume 2, Number 10 issue of Mankind Magazine it states there were twelve Remingtons from 1907 purchased from the Cosmopolitan Publishing Company that \\"were Mary Pickford's gift to her husband, Charles 'Buddy' Rogers\\". The interior of Pickfair was decorated and updated throughout the years by Marilyn Johnson Tucker, Elsie De Wolfe, Marjorie Requa, Tony Duquette, and Kathryn Crawford. During the 1920s the house became a focal point for Hollywood's social activities, and the couple became famous for entertaining there. An invitation to Pickfair was a sign of social acceptance into the closed Hollywood community. In 1928, Will Rogers said \\"My most important duty as mayor of Beverly Hills is directing people to Mary Pickford's house\\". Dinners at Pickfair became legendary; guests included Charlie Chaplin (who lived next door), the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, Mildred Harris, Greta Garbo, George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H.G. Wells, Lord Louis Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Tony Duquette, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joan Crawford, No√´l Coward, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, Pearl S. Buck, Charles Lindbergh, Max Reinhardt, Arthur Conan Doyle, Thomas Edison, Gloria Swanson, the Duke and Duchess of Alba, the King and Queen of Siam, Austen Chamberlain, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, the spiritual teacher Meher Baba, and Sir Harry Lauder. Lauder's nephew, Matt Lauder Jr., a professional golfer whose family had a property at Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California, taught Fairbanks to play golf. Fairbanks and Pickford divorced in January 1936, but Pickford continued to reside in the mansion with her third husband, actor and musician Charles \\"Buddy\\" Rogers, until her death in 1979. Pickford received few visitors in her later years, but continued to open up her grand home for charitable organizations and parties, including an annual Christmas party for blind war veterans, mostly from World War I. In 1976, Pickford received a second Academy Award for contribution to American film. The Academy Honorary Award was presented to her in the formal living room of Pickfair, and televised on the 48th Academy Awards. Introduced and narrated by Gene Kelly, it provided the public a very rare glimpse inside the fabled mansion.  Sale and demolition  Empty for several years after Pickford's death in 1979, Pickfair was eventually sold to Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss, who continued to care for the home, updating and preserving much of its unique charm. In 1988, it was purchased by actress Pia Zadora and her husband Meshulam Riklis. They announced they were planning renovations to the famous estate, but revealed in 1990 that they had in fact demolished Pickfair and a new larger \\"Venetian style palazzo\\" was going to be constructed in its place. In 1990, the 42 room estates was razed.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1990-04-20-mn-1392-story.html Faced with harsh criticism from a nostalgic public, including Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Zadora defended her family's actions, stating that the house was allegedly in a poor state of repair and was infested by termites. In the L.A. Times, Fairbanks, Jr. was quoted as saying, \\"I regret it very much. I wonder, if they were going to demolish it, why they bought it in the first place.\\" In 2012, Pia Zadora claimed on Season 4, Episode 4 of the BIO channel's Celebrity Ghost Stories that the real reason she demolished Pickfair was not due to termite infestation but because it was haunted by the laughing ghost of a woman who allegedly died there while having an affair with Douglas Fairbanks. Pia Zadora told her story in the Celebrity Ghost Stories on September 15, 2012; Season 4 Episode 12 starring Erin Moran, Pia Zadora and Michael Beach. In the interview she stated, \\"Years ago my husband and I tore down one of the most iconic Hollywood mansions because of termites ‚Ä¶ but that wasn't the real reason. When we moved into the house it was beautiful, everything was perfect, it was a dream ‚Ä¶ but weird things started to happen ‚Ä¶ so my husband and I, after trying to figure out what to do, decided we were going to have the house razed.\\" Defending her actions, she explained, \\"If I had a choice, I never would have torn down this old home. I loved this home, it had a history, it had a very important sense about it and you can deal with termites, and you can deal with plumbing issues, but you can't deal with the supernatural.\\" The only remaining artifacts from the original Pickfair are the gates to the estate, the kidney-shaped pool and pool house, remnants of the living room, as well as the two-bedroom guest wing that played host to visiting royalty and notable film celebrities for over half a century. The guest wing was once used as a honeymoon suite for Lord Louis and Lady Mountbatten. Located at 1143 Summit Drive in Beverly Hills. Architect Wallace Neff rebuilt the mansion to a Georgian style manor with . Unicom International bought the mansion on April 19, 2005, for $15,000,000.00.

Pop claims he was invited to Pia Zadora's house but didn't go, later saying \\"I hear they dismantled Pickfair... wasn't elegant enough\\", to which Harry replies \\"probably full of termites\\".

II, 1096] made for the purposes of section 122 of the Australian Constitution, placed the territory under the Commonwealth of Australia\\" Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of New Guinea were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.Papua and New Guinea Act, 1949 of the Commonwealth of Australia That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971.Papua New Guinea Act, 1971 of the Commonwealth of Australia Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of Papua at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity; it was a Possession of the Crown whereas the Territory of New Guinea was initially a League of Nations mandate territory and subsequently a United Nations trust territory. This legal and political distinction remained until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea in 1975. Papua made up the southern half of what is today Papua New Guinea and contained the territory's capital, Port Moresby, which then became the capital of the independent country. History The British flag being raised in 1883 after Queensland annexed the southern part of New Guinea =Background= Archeological evidence suggests that humans arrived on New Guinea at least 60,000 years ago. These Melanesian people developed stone tools and agriculture. Portuguese and Spanish navigators sailing in the South Pacific entered New Guinea waters in the early part of the 16th century and in 1526‚Äì27, Don Jorge de Meneses came upon the principal island \\"Papua\\". In 1545, the Spaniard √ç√±igo Ortiz de Retez gave the island the name \\"New Guinea\\" owing to what he saw as a resemblance between the islands' inhabitants and those found on the African Guinea coast. Knowledge of the interior of the island remained scant for several centuries after these initial European encounters. =Annexation= In 1883 Sir Thomas McIlwraith, the Premier of Queensland, ordered Henry Chester (1832‚Äì1914), the Police Magistrate on Thursday Island, to proceed to Port Moresby and annex New Guinea and adjacent islands in the name of the British government. Chester made the proclamation on 4 April 1883, but the British government repudiated the action. On 6 November 1884, after the Australian colonies had promised financial support, the territory became a British protectorate. On 4 September 1888 it was annexed, together with some adjacent islands, by Britain as British New Guinea. The northern part of modern Papua New Guinea was under German commercial control from 1884 and under direct rule by the German government in 1899, as the larger part of the colony of German New Guinea, then known as Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. In 1902, Papua was effectively transferred to the authority of the new British dominion of Australia. With the passage of the Papua Act 1905, the area was officially renamed the Territory of Papua, and Australian administration became formal in 1906. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Australia captured Kaiser-Wilhelmsland following the landing on 11 September 1914 of the 2000 man Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force. The Australian takeover of New Guinea was formalised by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. =World War II= Australian troops at Milne Bay, Papua. The Australian army was the first to inflict defeat on the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II at the Battle of Milne Bay of August‚ÄìSeptember 1942. Shortly after the start of the Pacific War, the island of New Guinea was invaded by the Japanese. Papua was the least affected region. Most of West Papua, at that time known as Dutch New Guinea, was occupied, as were large parts of the Territory of New Guinea (the former German New Guinea, which was also under Australian rule after World War I), but Papua was protected to a large extent by its southern location and the near-impassable Owen Stanley Ranges to the north. Civil administration was suspended during the war and both territories (Papua and New Guinea) were placed under martial law for the duration. The New Guinea campaign opened with the battles for New Britain and New Ireland in the Territory of New Guinea in 1942. Rabaul, the capital of the Territory, was overwhelmed on 22‚Äì23 January and was established as a major Japanese base from where the Japanese landed on mainland New Guinea and advanced towards Port Moresby and Australia. Having had their initial effort to capture Port Moresby by a seaborne invasion disrupted by the U.S. Navy and Australian navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted a landward attack from the north via the Kokoda Track. From July 1942, a few Australian reserve battalions, many of them very young and untrained, fought a stubborn rearguard action against the Japanese attack, over the rugged Owen Stanley Ranges. The militia, worn out and severely depleted by casualties, held out with the assistance of Papuan porters and medical assistants, and were relieved in late August by regular troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force, returning from action in the Mediterranean Theatre. In early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay, near the eastern tip of Papua. They were beaten back by the Australian Army, and the Battle of Milne Bay is remembered as the first outright defeat of Japanese land forces during World War II. The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943‚Äì44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces. The Supreme Commander of operations was the United States General Douglas Macarthur, with Australian General Thomas Blamey taking a direct role in planning, and operations being essentially directed by staff at New Guinea Force headquarters in Port Moresby. Bitter fighting continued in New Guinea between the largely Australian force and the Japanese 18th Army based in New Guinea until the Japanese surrender in 1945. =Administrative unification with New Guinea= After the war, the Papua and New Guinea Act 1949 united the Territory of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. However, for the purposes of Australian nationality a distinction was maintained between the two territories. The act provided for a Legislative Council (which was established in 1951), a judicial organization, a public service, and a system of local government. Under Australian Minister for External Territories Andrew Peacock, the territory adopted self-government in 1972 and on 15 September 1975, during the term of the Whitlam Government in Australia, the Territory became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.

It is fairly compact compared with other city centers on the U.S. West Coast due to its geographical situation, being hemmed in on the north and east by hills, on the west by Elliott Bay, and on the south by reclaimed land that was once tidal flats. It is bounded on the north by Denny Way, beyond which are Lower Queen Anne (sometimes known as \\"Uptown\\"), Seattle Center, and South Lake Union; on the east by Interstate 5, beyond which is Capitol Hill to the northeast and the Central District to the east; on the south by S Dearborn Street, beyond which is Sodo; and on the west by Elliott Bay, a part of Puget Sound. Neighborhoods Belltown, Denny Triangle, the retail district, the West Edge, the financial district, the government district, Pioneer Square, Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon, and the western flank of First Hill west of Broadway make up downtown Seattle's chief neighborhoods. Near the center of downtown is the Metropolitan Tract which is owned by the University of Washington; prior to 1895 it served as the location of the university's campus. Downtown is Seattle's financial and commercial maritime hub as well as its center of nightlife and shopping. The downtown shopping mall Westlake Center is connected to Seattle Center by a monorail. Landmarks Downtown Seattle's Columbia Center has 76 floors, a greater number than any other building west of the Mississippi River (although there are taller buildings in Texas and California). Smith Tower, in the Pioneer Square area, once held the title of tallest American building west of the Mississippi. Other notable buildings are the Washington Mutual Tower, Two Union Square, Nordstrom‚Äôs flagship store, Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and the main building of the Seattle Art Museum (built 1991, expanded 2007), the main facade of which was designed by Robert Venturi. Downtown parks include Westlake Park, Freeway Park, and Victor Steinbrueck Park. The Olympic Sculpture Park was completed on the Belltown waterfront in January 2007. Downtown is also home to the landmark Pike Place Market, the oldest continually operating farmer's market in the United States and the core of activity in the area. History After abandoning 'New York Alki', the Denny Party moved across the then-named Duwamish Bay in April 1852 to a low level marsh situated with a safe deep water harbor, located roughly in the city's Pioneer Square district. They named this new frontier 'Duwamps'. In the late 1850s, present day Downtown Seattle became the main residential outskirts of the city. After the Great Seattle Fire, the business district was moved to the area. Several of the city's hills around downtown were regraded starting around 1876.  Expansion  With about 65,000 people living in Seattle's core neighborhoods as of 2015, the downtown area's population is growing. Downtown saw a 10 percent increase in the number of occupied housing units and an 8 percent increase in population between 2010 and 2014, outpacing growth in the city as a whole. As of the end of 2014, there were 32 apartment and 2 condominium projects under construction, representing over 5,000 units. In 1989, building heights in Downtown and adjoining Seattle suburbs were tightly restricted following a voter initiative. These restrictions were dramatically loosened in 2006, leading to the increase in high-rise construction. This policy change has divided commentators between those who support the increased density and those who criticize it as \\"Manhattanization.\\" , Downtown Seattle has 82,000 residents and 300,000 jobs, including 48,000 added since 2010 in the Denny Triangle area. The downtown area has of office space, representing 79 percent of citywide inventory and 55 percent of commercial properties in the city. Office construction continues apace in Downtown Seattle, with planned to open in 2019, along with 161 projects. Economy Downtown Seattle is the largest employment center in the Puget Sound region, with an estimated employee population of 243,995 in 2013, accounting for half of the city's jobs and 21 percent of King County jobs. Several Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Downtown Seattle include Amazon.com, Nordstrom, and Expeditors International.

The center was designed by Cox Richardson Rayner, built by PSA International, and funded by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The S$220 million building (excluding the cost of the 40,000 m¬≤ expansion) is located in Tampines, Singapore. The Singapore Expo was officially opened on 4 March 1999. It has since been managed by Singex Venues Private Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of Temasek Holdings. Facilities Singapore EXPO Convention and Exhibition Center is the largest meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE) venue in Singapore and is one of the largest and most completely equipped centre in the whole of Asia. There are ten large multipurpose halls, each being 10,000 square metres in size, giving a total floor space of over 100,000 square metres. All available spaces are interconnected, column-free and on the ground level. Ten conference halls are also available, ranging in size from 89 to 844 square metres, suitable for accommodating 150 to 1,000 people. In addition, there are meeting rooms which can seat 15 to 125 members. The original Singapore Expo building comprised six interconnected halls of 10,000 square metres each, with column free-spaces and ceiling heights of up to 16 metres. Each hall is self-contained and is linked to the other halls by air-conditioned walkways. An additional 40,000 square metres (four new halls) were completed on 15 September 2005 and linked to the original building across Expo Drive via a sheltered walkway. In addition, the MAX Atria @ Singapore Expo opened on 22 March 2012 as part of Singapore Expo's expansion. It caters for changing needs of meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions participants and is an environmentally-friendly building. In addition, it is the first venue to provide free WiFi for participants. A carpark for 2,200 vehicles is also available, which can be converted into 25,000 square metres of outdoor exhibition space. It is connected to the MRT train network through the nearby Expo MRT station, allowing access via East West MRT line and Downtown MRT line. History With the exhibition space at the World Trade Centre slated for demolition, a replacement venue that could exceed the 34,000 square metres of indoor space was needed. The initial phase of the construction on the building thereby commenced on 30 May 1997, in spite of the impact the Asian financial crisis had on the economy, and it was completed two years later when the building was officially opened on 4 March 1999. Critics predicted that the halls would be under-utilised and further worsened by its relatively remote location, compared to the old World Trade Centre, or the Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre which had opened earlier in 1995. Bus (Services 12 and 24) and taxi services were the primary mode of transportation commuters took to reach Expo, both of which were overwhelmed during peak hours. This led to a pressing need for an MRT station connecting to the MRT route to both Changi Airport and the town, together with the merger of bus service 220 and 290 to form 38, running from Tampines to Bedok. The initial years almost proved the critics right, although the venue made a quick turnaround within a few years. The opening of the Expo MRT station on 10 January 2001 was a boost to the venue, which was experiencing increasing usage for functions including conventions, exhibitions, rock concerts, New Year parties, beauty pageants, musicals, and even as examination halls for educational institutions. By 2003, demand for ever bigger exhibition space prompted the Singapore Expo to proceed with its expansion plans, especially in response to the needs of IMTA Asia, which was slated to be held from 17 to 21 October 2005. With the inaugural show already occupying the full 60,000 square metres of space, pressure was on the venue to expand, or the prestigious event may have to move somewhere else since there is no other bigger venue available in Singapore. In response, a new 40,000 square metre expansion comprising a further four halls was constructed adjacent to the existing halls across Expo Drive in double quick time to meet the expected exhibition period, and was completed on 15 September that year. The extension includes a multi-purpose event hall and auditorium for large- scale meetings, seminars, conferences, congresses, concerts and other special events known as The MAX Pavilion. The original plan to build the second phase at the carpark is still on the cards. Since 2001, the Bethesda Community church has been renting the Singapore EXPO Meeting Rooms for weekly services. Since December 2005, the largest church in Singapore, City Harvest Church, used Hall 8 of the Singapore Expo on a weekly basis, while the 10,000-member Faith Community Baptist Church used Hall 10 (The Max Pavilion) till the Urban Redevelopment Authority imposed their terms of religious organisations leasing venues of not more than in February 2011. Another expansion was done to cater for the changing needs of MICE participants with the MAX Atria @ Singapore Expo, which opened on 22 March 2012. The building has environmentally-friendly features and provides free WiFi for participants, the first in Asia to do so. =Downtown line connection= Road sign along Upper Changi Road East pointing to the exhibition halls. Singapore EXPO has been connected to the Downtown line after the Downtown line portion of Expo MRT station began operations. = Use as community care facility during COVID-19 pandemic = In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the Singapore EXPO was temporarily converted to an isolation facility to house COVID-19 patients who were recovering or displayed mild symptoms only, and had been operational since 10 April 2020. Cubicles were set up across two halls, with each cubicle featuring everyday necessities for daily living such as beds, chairs, lamps, charging points and WiFi coverage, on top of communal facilities such as shared toilets and food distribution points. In addition to staff from healthcare providers Parkway Pantai and Woodlands Health Campus, about 100 soldiers (comprising regulars, full-time national servicemen and operationally ready national servicemen) from the Singapore Armed Forces Medical Corps were also deployed at the EXPO to look after the patients. Since 10 April 2020, patients were transferred to Singapore Expo as it had already been set up as a Community Isolation Facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

They are named for Astley Cooper, who first described them in 1840.A. P. Cooper. On the anatomy of the breast. 2 volumes. London, Longman,1840. Their anatomy can be revealed using Transmission diffraction tomography. Cooper's Suspensory Ligament should not be confused with the pectineal ligament (sometimes called the inguinal ligament of Cooper) which shares the same eponym. Also, the intermediate fibers and/or the transverse part of the ulnar collateral ligament are sometimes called Cooper's ligament(s).http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/transverse+ligament+of+elbowWaldeyer's Human Anatomy - Membrum superius, articulatio cubiti Structure The ligaments run from the clavicle and the clavipectoral fascia, branching out through and around breast tissue to the dermis of the skin overlying the breast. The intact ligament suspends the breast from the clavicle and the underlying deep fascia of the upper chest. This has the effect of supporting the breast in its normal position, and maintaining its normal shape. Without the internal support of this ligament, the breast tissue (which is heavier than the surrounding fat) sags under its own weight, losing its normal shape and contour. Clinical significance The suspensory ligaments of Cooper play an important role in the change in appearance of the breast that often accompanies the development of inflammatory carcinoma of the breast in which blockage of the local lymphatic ducts causes swelling of the breast. Because the skin remains tethered by the suspensory ligaments of Cooper, it takes on a dimpled appearance reminiscent of the peel of an orange (peau d'orange). Carcinomas can also decrease the length of Cooper's ligaments leading to a dimpling. Relationship to sagging Many women believe that sagging is caused by the failure of the Cooper's ligaments to support the breast tissue. In fact, sagging is partly determined by genetic factors, but a scientific study found that the biggest factors affecting sagging are cigarette smoking, a woman's body mass index, her number of pregnancies, the size of her breasts before pregnancy, and her age. Many women incorrectly believe that wearing a brassiere prevents their breasts from sagging later in life and that breasts cannot anatomically support themselves. But bra manufacturers have stated that because breasts are formed of fatty tissue and not muscle, bras only affect the shape of breasts while they are being worn. Pathologically heavy breasts may cause pain in the woman's upper thoracic area, but this may be due to a poorly-fitting bra. Numerous reports state that 80‚Äì85% of women are wearing the wrong bra size. In middle-aged women, breast ptosis is caused by a combination of factors. If the woman has had children, postpartum hormonal changes will cause the depleted milk glands to atrophy. Women who experience multiple pregnancies repeatedly stretch the skin envelope during engorgement while lactating. In addition, after the birth of each child, the voluminous milk glands diminish in size, contributing further to sagging. As a woman's breasts grow in size during repeated pregnancies, the Cooper's ligaments that maintain the position of the mammary glands against the chest, are stretched and gradually lose strength. Breast tissue and suspensory ligaments may also be stretched if the woman is overweight or loses and gains weight.

The definition of coherent sheaves is made with reference to a sheaf of rings that codifies this geometric information. Coherent sheaves can be seen as a generalization of vector bundles. Unlike vector bundles, they form an abelian category, and so they are closed under operations such as taking kernels, images, and cokernels. The quasi-coherent sheaves are a generalization of coherent sheaves and include the locally free sheaves of infinite rank. Coherent sheaf cohomology is a powerful technique, in particular for studying the sections of a given coherent sheaf.  Definitions  A quasi-coherent sheaf on a ringed space (X, \\\\mathcal O_X) is a sheaf \\\\mathcal F of \\\\mathcal O_X-modules which has a local presentation, that is, every point in X has an open neighborhood U in which there is an exact sequence :\\\\mathcal{O}_X^{\\\\oplus I}_{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X^{\\\\oplus J}_{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{F}_{U} \\\\to 0 for some (possibly infinite) sets I and J. A coherent sheaf on a ringed space (X, \\\\mathcal O_X) is a sheaf \\\\mathcal F satisfying the following two properties: # \\\\mathcal F is of finite type over \\\\mathcal O_X, that is, every point in X has an open neighborhood U in X such that there is a surjective morphism \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n_{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{F}_{U} for some natural number n; # for any open set U\\\\subseteq X, any natural number n, and any morphism \\\\varphi: \\\\mathcal{O}_X^n_{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{F}_{U} of \\\\mathcal O_X-modules, the kernel of \\\\varphi is of finite type. Morphisms between (quasi-)coherent sheaves are the same as morphisms of sheaves of \\\\mathcal O_X-modules. = The case of schemes = When X is a scheme, the general definitions above are equivalent to more explicit ones. A sheaf \\\\mathcal F of \\\\mathcal O_X-modules is quasi- coherent if and only if over each open affine subscheme U=\\\\operatorname{Spec} A the restriction \\\\mathcal F_U is isomorphic to the sheaf \\\\tilde{M} associated to the module M=\\\\Gamma(U, \\\\mathcal F) over A. When X is a locally Noetherian scheme, \\\\mathcal F is coherent if and only if it is quasi-coherent and the modules M above can be taken to be finitely generated. On an affine scheme U = \\\\operatorname{Spec} A, there is an equivalence of categories from A-modules to quasi-coherent sheaves, taking a module M to the associated sheaf \\\\tilde{M}. The inverse equivalence takes a quasi-coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal F on U to the A-module \\\\mathcal F(U) of global sections of \\\\mathcal F. Here are several further characterizations of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme..  Properties  On an arbitrary ringed space quasi-coherent sheaves do not necessarily form an abelian category. On the other hand, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form an abelian category, and they are extremely useful in that context.. On any ringed space X, the coherent sheaves form an abelian category, a full subcategory of the category of \\\\mathcal O_X-modules.. (Analogously, the category of coherent modules over any ring A is a full abelian subcategory of the category of all A-modules.) So the kernel, image, and cokernel of any map of coherent sheaves are coherent. The direct sum of two coherent sheaves is coherent; more generally, an \\\\mathcal O_X-module that is an extension of two coherent sheaves is coherent.Serre (1955), section 13. A submodule of a coherent sheaf is coherent if it is of finite type. A coherent sheaf is always an \\\\mathcal O_X-module of finite presentation, meaning that each point x in X has an open neighborhood U such that the restriction \\\\mathcal F_U of \\\\mathcal F to U is isomorphic to the cokernel of a morphism \\\\mathcal O_X^n_U \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_X^m_U for some natural numbers n and m. If \\\\mathcal O_X is coherent, then, conversely, every sheaf of finite presentation over \\\\mathcal O_X is coherent. The sheaf of rings \\\\mathcal O_X is called coherent if it is coherent considered as a sheaf of modules over itself. In particular, the Oka coherence theorem states that the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a complex analytic space X is a coherent sheaf of rings. The main part of the proof is the case X = \\\\mathbf C^n. Likewise, on a locally Noetherian scheme X, the structure sheaf \\\\mathcal O_X is a coherent sheaf of rings.Grothendieck, EGA I, Corollaire 1.5.2. Basic constructions of coherent sheaves * An \\\\mathcal O_X-module \\\\mathcal F on a ringed space X is called locally free of finite rank, or a vector bundle, if every point in X has an open neighborhood U such that the restriction \\\\mathcal F_U is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of \\\\mathcal O_X_U. If \\\\mathcal F is free of the same rank n near every point of X, then the vector bundle \\\\mathcal F is said to be of rank n. :Vector bundles in this sheaf-theoretic sense over a scheme X are equivalent to vector bundles defined in a more geometric way, as a scheme E with a morphism \\\\pi: E\\\\to X and with a covering of X by open sets U_\\\\alpha with given isomorphisms \\\\pi^{-1}(U_\\\\alpha) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb A^n \\\\times U_\\\\alpha over U_\\\\alpha such that the two isomorphisms over an intersection U_\\\\alpha \\\\cap U_\\\\beta differ by a linear automorphism.Hartshorne (1977), Exercise II.5.18. (The analogous equivalence also holds for complex analytic spaces.) For example, given a vector bundle E in this geometric sense, the corresponding sheaf \\\\mathcal F is defined by: over an open set U of X, the \\\\mathcal O(U)-module \\\\mathcal F(U) is the set of sections of the morphism \\\\pi^{-1}(U) \\\\to U. The sheaf-theoretic interpretation of vector bundles has the advantage that vector bundles (on a locally Noetherian scheme) are included in the abelian category of coherent sheaves. *Locally free sheaves come equipped with the standard \\\\mathcal O_X-module operations, but these give back locally free sheaves. *Let X = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R), R a Noetherian ring. Then vector bundles on X are exactly the sheaves associated to finitely generated projective modules over R, or (equivalently) to finitely generated flat modules over R.. *Let X = \\\\operatorname{Proj}(R), R a Noetherian \\\\N-graded ring, be a projective scheme over a Noetherian ring R_0. Then each \\\\Z-graded R-module M determines a quasi- coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal F on X such that \\\\mathcal F_{\\\\\\\\{ f e 0 \\\\\\\\}} is the sheaf associated to the R[f^{-1}]_0-module M[f^{-1}]_0, where f is a homogeneous element of R of positive degree and \\\\\\\\{f e 0 \\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Spec} R[f^{-1}]_0 is the locus where f does not vanish. *For example, for each integer n, let R(n) denote the graded R-module given by R(n)_l =R_{n+l}. Then each R(n) determines the quasi-coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal O_X(n) on X. If R is generated as R_0-algebra by R_1, then \\\\mathcal O_X(n) is a line bundle (invertible sheaf) on X and \\\\mathcal O_X(n) is the n-th tensor power of \\\\mathcal O_X(1). In particular, \\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n}(-1) is called the tautological line bundle on the projective n-space. *A simple example of a coherent sheaf on \\\\mathbb{P}^2 which is not a vector bundle is given by the cokernel in the following sequence ::\\\\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cdot (x^2-yz,y^3 + xy^2 - xyz)} \\\\mathcal{O}(3)\\\\oplus \\\\mathcal{O}(4) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\to 0 :this is because \\\\mathcal{E} restricted to the vanishing locus of the two polynomials is the zero object. * Ideal sheaves: If Z is a closed subscheme of a locally Noetherian scheme X, the sheaf \\\\mathcal I_{Z/X} of all regular functions vanishing on Z is coherent. Likewise, if Z is a closed analytic subspace of a complex analytic space X, the ideal sheaf \\\\mathcal I_{Z/X} is coherent. * The structure sheaf \\\\mathcal O_Z of a closed subscheme Z of a locally Noetherian scheme X can be viewed as a coherent sheaf on X. To be precise, this is the direct image sheaf i_*\\\\mathcal O_Z, where i: Z \\\\to X is the inclusion. Likewise for a closed analytic subspace of a complex analytic space. The sheaf i_*\\\\mathcal O_Z has fiber (defined below) of dimension zero at points in the open set X-Z, and fiber of dimension 1 at points in Z. There is a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on X: ::0\\\\to \\\\mathcal I_{Z/X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_X \\\\to i_*\\\\mathcal O_Z \\\\to 0. *Most operations of linear algebra preserve coherent sheaves. In particular, for coherent sheaves \\\\mathcal F and \\\\mathcal G on a ringed space X, the tensor product sheaf \\\\mathcal F \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathcal O_X}\\\\mathcal G and the sheaf of homomorphisms \\\\mathcal Hom_{\\\\mathcal O_X}(\\\\mathcal F, \\\\mathcal G) are coherent.Serre (1955), section 14. *A simple non-example of a quasi-coherent sheaf is given by the extension by zero functor. For example, consider i_!\\\\mathcal{O}_X for ::X = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(\\\\Complex[x,x^{-1}]) \\\\xrightarrow{i} \\\\operatorname{Spec}(\\\\Complex[x])=Y :Since this sheaf has non-trivial stalks, but zero global sections, this cannot be a quasi-coherent sheaf. This is because quasi-coherent sheaves on an affine scheme are equivalent to the category of modules over the underlying ring, and the adjunction comes from taking global sections. Functoriality Let f: X\\\\to Y be a morphism of ringed spaces (for example, a morphism of schemes). If \\\\mathcal F is a quasi- coherent sheaf on Y, then the inverse image \\\\mathcal O_X-module (or pullback) f^*\\\\mathcal F is quasi-coherent on X.. For a morphism of schemes f: X\\\\to Y and a coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal F on Y, the pullback f^*\\\\mathcal F is not coherent in full generality (for example, f^*\\\\mathcal O_Y = \\\\mathcal O_X, which might not be coherent), but pullbacks of coherent sheaves are coherent if X is locally Noetherian. An important special case is the pullback of a vector bundle, which is a vector bundle. If f: X\\\\to Y is a quasi-compact quasi- separated morphism of schemes and \\\\mathcal F is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X, then the direct image sheaf (or pushforward) f_*\\\\mathcal F is quasi-coherent on Y. The direct image of a coherent sheaf is often not coherent. For example, for a field k, let X be the affine line over k, and consider the morphism f: X\\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k); then the direct image f_*\\\\mathcal O_X is the sheaf on \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k) associated to the polynomial ring k[x], which is not coherent because k[x] has infinite dimension as a k-vector space. On the other hand, the direct image of a coherent sheaf under a proper morphism is coherent, by results of Grauert and Grothendieck. Local behavior of coherent sheaves An important feature of coherent sheaves \\\\mathcal F is that the properties of \\\\mathcal F at a point x control the behavior of \\\\mathcal F in a neighborhood of x, more than would be true for an arbitrary sheaf. For example, Nakayama's lemma says (in geometric language) that if \\\\mathcal F is a coherent sheaf on a scheme X, then the fiber \\\\mathcal F_x\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathcal O_{X,x}} k(x) of \\\\mathcal F at a point x (a vector space over the residue field k(x)) is zero if and only if the sheaf F is zero on some open neighborhood of x. A related fact is that the dimension of the fibers of a coherent sheaf is upper-semicontinuous.Hartshorne (1977), Example III.12.7.2. Thus a coherent sheaf has constant rank on an open set, while the rank can jump up on a lower-dimensional closed subset. In the same spirit: a coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal F on a scheme X is a vector bundle if and only if its stalk \\\\mathcal F_x is a free module over the local ring \\\\mathcal O_{X,x} for every point x in X.Grothendieck, EGA I, Ch. 0, 5.2.7. On a general scheme, one cannot determine whether a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle just from its fibers (as opposed to its stalks). On a reduced locally Noetherian scheme, however, a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle if and only if its rank is locally constant.Eisenbud (1995), Exercise 20.13. Examples of vector bundles For a morphism of schemes X\\\\to Y, let \\\\Delta: X\\\\to X\\\\times_Y X be the diagonal morphism, which is a closed immersion if X is separated over Y. Let \\\\mathcal I be the ideal sheaf of X in X\\\\times_Y X. Then the sheaf of differentials \\\\Omega^1_{X/Y} can be defined as the pullback \\\\Delta^*\\\\mathcal I of \\\\mathcal I to X. Sections of this sheaf are called 1-forms on X over Y, and they can be written locally on X as finite sums \\\\textstyle\\\\sum f_j\\\\, dg_j for regular functions f_j and g_j. If X is locally of finite type over a field k, then \\\\Omega^1_{X/k} is a coherent sheaf on X. If X is smooth over k, then \\\\Omega^1 (meaning \\\\Omega^1_{X/k}) is a vector bundle over X, called the cotangent bundle of X. Then the tangent bundle TX is defined to be the dual bundle (\\\\Omega^1)^*. For X smooth over k of dimension n everywhere, the tangent bundle has rank n. If Y is a smooth closed subscheme of a smooth scheme X over k, then there is a short exact sequence of vector bundles on Y: :0\\\\to TY \\\\to TX_Y \\\\to N_{Y/X}\\\\to 0, which can be used as a definition of the normal bundle N_{Y/X} to Y in X. For a smooth scheme X over a field k and a natural number i, the vector bundle \\\\Omega^i of i-forms on X is defined as the i-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle, \\\\Omega^i = \\\\Lambda^i \\\\Omega^1. For a smooth variety X of dimension n over k, the canonical bundle K_X means the line bundle \\\\Omega^n. Thus sections of the canonical bundle are algebro- geometric analogs of volume forms on X. For example, a section of the canonical bundle of affine space \\\\mathbb A^n over k can be written as :f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\; dx_1 \\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx_n, where f is a polynomial with coefficients in k. Let R be a commutative ring and n a natural number. For each integer j, there is an important example of a line bundle on projective space \\\\mathbb P^n over R, called \\\\mathcal O(j). To define this, consider the morphism of R-schemes :\\\\pi: \\\\mathbb A^{n+1}-0\\\\to \\\\mathbb P^n given in coordinates by (x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\mapsto [x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n]. (That is, thinking of projective space as the space of 1-dimensional linear subspaces of affine space, send a nonzero point in affine space to the line that it spans.) Then a section of \\\\mathcal O(j) over an open subset U of \\\\mathbb P^n is defined to be a regular function f on \\\\pi^{-1}(U) that is homogeneous of degree j, meaning that :f(ax)=a^jf(x) as regular functions on (\\\\mathbb A^{1} - 0) \\\\times \\\\pi^{-1}(U). For all integers i and j, there is an isomorphism \\\\mathcal O(i) \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal O(j) \\\\cong \\\\mathcal O(i+j) of line bundles on \\\\mathbb P^n. In particular, every homogeneous polynomial in x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n of degree j over R can be viewed as a global section of \\\\mathcal O(j) over \\\\mathbb P^n. Note that every closed subscheme of projective space can be defined as the zero set of some collection of homogeneous polynomials, hence as the zero set of some sections of the line bundles \\\\mathcal O(j).Hartshorne (1977), Corollary II.5.16. This contrasts with the simpler case of affine space, where a closed subscheme is simply the zero set of some collection of regular functions. The regular functions on projective space \\\\mathbb P^n over R are just the \\"constants\\" (the ring R), and so it is essential to work with the line bundles \\\\mathcal O(j). Serre gave an algebraic description of all coherent sheaves on projective space, more subtle than what happens for affine space. Namely, let R be a Noetherian ring (for example, a field), and consider the polynomial ring S = R[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n] as a graded ring with each x_i having degree 1. Then every finitely generated graded S-module M has an associated coherent sheaf \\\\tilde M on \\\\mathbb P^n over R. Every coherent sheaf on \\\\mathbb P^n arises in this way from a finitely generated graded S-module M. (For example, the line bundle \\\\mathcal O(j) is the sheaf associated to the S-module S with its grading lowered by j.) But the S-module M that yields a given coherent sheaf on \\\\mathbb P^n is not unique; it is only unique up to changing M by graded modules that are nonzero in only finitely many degrees. More precisely, the abelian category of coherent sheaves on \\\\mathbb P^n is the quotient of the category of finitely generated graded S-modules by the Serre subcategory of modules that are nonzero in only finitely many degrees.. The tangent bundle of projective space \\\\mathbb P^n over a field k can be described in terms of the line bundle \\\\mathcal O(1). Namely, there is a short exact sequence, the Euler sequence: : 0\\\\to \\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb P^n}\\\\to \\\\mathcal O(1)^{\\\\oplus \\\\; n+1}\\\\to T\\\\mathbb P^n\\\\to 0. It follows that the canonical bundle K_{\\\\mathbb P^n} (the dual of the determinant line bundle of the tangent bundle) is isomorphic to \\\\mathcal O(-n-1). This is a fundamental calculation for algebraic geometry. For example, the fact that the canonical bundle is a negative multiple of the ample line bundle \\\\mathcal O(1) means that projective space is a Fano variety. Over the complex numbers, this means that projective space has a K√§hler metric with positive Ricci curvature. = Vector bundles on a hypersurface = Consider a smooth degree-d hypersurface X \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{P}^n defined by the homogeneous polynomial f of degree d. Then, there is an exact sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_X(-d) \\\\to i^*\\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n} \\\\to \\\\Omega_X \\\\to 0 where the second map is the pullback of differential forms, and the first map sends : \\\\phi \\\\mapsto d(f\\\\cdot \\\\phi) Note that this sequence tells us that \\\\mathcal O(-d) is the conormal sheaf of X in \\\\mathbb P^n. Dualizing this yields the exact sequence : 0 \\\\to T_X \\\\to i^*T_{\\\\mathbb{P}^n} \\\\to \\\\mathcal O(d) \\\\to 0 hence \\\\mathcal O(d) is the normal bundle of X in \\\\mathbb P^n. If we use the fact that given an exact sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal E_1 \\\\to \\\\mathcal E_2 \\\\to \\\\mathcal E_3 \\\\to 0 of vector bundles with ranks r_1,r_2,r_3, there is an isomorphism :\\\\Lambda^{r_2}\\\\mathcal E_2 \\\\cong \\\\Lambda^{r_1}\\\\mathcal E_1\\\\otimes \\\\Lambda^{r_3}\\\\mathcal E_3 of line bundles, then we see that there is the isomorphism :i^*\\\\omega_{\\\\mathbb P^n} \\\\cong \\\\omega_X\\\\otimes \\\\mathcal O_X(-d) showing that :\\\\omega_X \\\\cong \\\\mathcal O_X(d - n -1) Chern classes and algebraic K-theory A vector bundle E on a smooth variety X over a field has Chern classes in the Chow ring of X, c_i(E) in CH^i(X) for i\\\\geq 0.Fulton (1998), section 3.2 and Example 8.3.3. These satisfy the same formal properties as Chern classes in topology. For example, for any short exact sequence :0\\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0 of vector bundles on X, the Chern classes of B are given by :c_i(B) = c_i(A)+c_1(A)c_{i-1}(C)+\\\\cdots+c_{i-1}(A)c_1(C)+c_i(C). It follows that the Chern classes of a vector bundle E depend only on the class of E in the Grothendieck group K_0(X). By definition, for a scheme X, K_0(X) is the quotient of the free abelian group on the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles on X by the relation that [B] = [A] + [C] for any short exact sequence as above. Although K_0(X) is hard to compute in general, algebraic K-theory provides many tools for studying it, including a sequence of related groups K_i(X) for integers i>0. A variant is the group G_0(X) (or K_0'(X)), the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on X. (In topological terms, G-theory has the formal properties of a Borel‚ÄìMoore homology theory for schemes, while K-theory is the corresponding cohomology theory.) The natural homomorphism K_0(X)\\\\to G_0(X) is an isomorphism if X is a regular separated Noetherian scheme, using that every coherent sheaf has a finite resolution by vector bundles in that case.Fulton (1998), B.8.3. For example, that gives a definition of the Chern classes of a coherent sheaf on a smooth variety over a field. More generally, a Noetherian scheme X is said to have the resolution property if every coherent sheaf on X has a surjection from some vector bundle on X. For example, every quasi-projective scheme over a Noetherian ring has the resolution property. = Applications of resolution property = Since the resolution property states that a coherent sheaf \\\\mathcal E on a Noetherian scheme is quasi-isomorphic in the derived category to the complex of vector bundles :\\\\mathcal E_k \\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\to \\\\mathcal E_1 \\\\to \\\\mathcal E_0 we can compute the total Chern class of \\\\mathcal E with :c(\\\\mathcal E) = c(\\\\mathcal E_0)c(\\\\mathcal E_1)^{-1} \\\\cdots c(\\\\mathcal E_k)^{(-1)^k} For example, this formula is useful for finding the Chern classes of the sheaf representing a subscheme of X. If we take the projective scheme Z associated to the ideal (xy,xz) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb C[x,y,z,w], then :c(\\\\mathcal O_Z) = \\\\frac{c(\\\\mathcal O)c(\\\\mathcal O(-3))}{c(\\\\mathcal O(-2)\\\\oplus \\\\mathcal O(-2))} since there is the resolution :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal O(-3) \\\\to \\\\mathcal O(-2)\\\\oplus\\\\mathcal O(-2) \\\\to \\\\mathcal O \\\\to \\\\mathcal O_Z \\\\to 0 over \\\\mathbb{CP}^3.  Bundle homomorphism vs. sheaf homomorphism  When vector bundles and locally free sheaves of finite constant rank are used interchangeably, care must be given to distinguish between bundle homomorphisms and sheaf homomorphisms. Specifically, given vector bundles p: E \\\\to X, \\\\, q: F \\\\to X, by definition, a bundle homomorphism \\\\varphi: E \\\\to F is a scheme morphism over X (i.e., p = q \\\\circ \\\\varphi) such that, for each geometric point x in X, \\\\varphi_x: p^{-1}(x) \\\\to q^{-1}(x) is a linear map of rank independent of x. Thus, it induces the sheaf homomorphism \\\\widetilde{\\\\varphi}: \\\\mathcal E \\\\to \\\\mathcal F of constant rank between the corresponding locally free \\\\mathcal O_X-modules (sheaves of dual sections). But there may be an \\\\mathcal O_X-module homomorphism that does not arise this way; namely, those not having constant rank. In particular, a subbundle E \\\\subset F is a subsheaf (i.e., \\\\mathcal E is a subsheaf of \\\\mathcal F). But the converse can fail; for example, for an effective Cartier divisor D on X, \\\\mathcal O_X(-D) \\\\subset \\\\mathcal O_X is a subsheaf but typically not a subbundle (since any line bundle has only two subbundles). The category of quasi-coherent sheaves Quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form an abelian category. Gabber showed that, in fact, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form a particularly well-behaved abelian category, a Grothendieck category.. A quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme X (such as an algebraic variety over a field) is determined up to isomorphism by the abelian category of quasi-coherent sheaves on X, by Rosenberg, generalizing a result of Gabriel.Antieau (2016), Corollary 4.2. Coherent cohomology The fundamental technical tool in algebraic geometry is the cohomology theory of coherent sheaves. Although it was introduced only in the 1950s, many earlier techniques of algebraic geometry are clarified by the language of sheaf cohomology applied to coherent sheaves. Broadly speaking, coherent sheaf cohomology can be viewed as a tool for producing functions with specified properties; sections of line bundles or of more general sheaves can be viewed as generalized functions. In complex analytic geometry, coherent sheaf cohomology also plays a foundational role. Among the core results of coherent sheaf cohomology are results on finite-dimensionality of cohomology, results on the vanishing of cohomology in various cases, duality theorems such as Serre duality, relations between topology and algebraic geometry such as Hodge theory, and formulas for Euler characteristics of coherent sheaves such as the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem.

Yeppoon is renowned for its beaches, tropical climate, and the islands out on the bay. Twenty-five minutes from the city of Rockhampton, Yeppoon is the principal town on the Capricorn Coast, a string of seaside communities stretching more than from north to south. The beaches and shallow coves provide a destination both for tourists and retirees settling down in Central Queensland. Offshore, there are 27 islands including Great Keppel Island which is from Yeppoon. Geography Yeppoon is located on Keppel Bay which opens to the Coral Sea, around north of the state capital, Brisbane, and from Rockhampton City. It is Central Queensland. History The Capricorn Coast was part of the traditional lands of the Darumbal Aboriginal people. Yeppoon was first settled by the Ross family in 1865 who took up large landholding along the length of the Capricorn Coast. Fruit crops, cattle, and wool were the major industries of the early town. A short-lived period of sugar cane growing followed from 1883 to 1903, which failed due to unseasonal rains and lack of financial backing. Along with other sugar growing areas of Australia, South Sea Islanders were used as labourers on the sugar plantations, often without their consent (see blackbirding). Pineapples, mangoes, and other tropical fruit became the mainstay of local agriculture in the new century, with cattle grazing and fishing also contributing to the local economy. Yeppoon Provisional School opened on 4 May 1885 and became Yeppoon State School on 1 October 1889. St Ursula's College, a day and boarding school for girls, opened on 12 March 1918. St Brendan's College, a day and boarding school for boys, opened on 8 October 1939. Yeppoon Infants State School opened on 24 January 1955, but closed in 1968. Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School opened in 1958. Yeppoon State High School opened on 28 January 1969. The Bay View Tower motel and restaurant become Yeppoon first high rise in 1986. On 20 February 2015, severe tropical cyclone Marcia crossed the Capricorn Coast near Shoalwater Bay as a category 5 Cyclone. The storm destroyed more than 150 houses in Yeppoon and left more than 13,500 residents without power. The Yeppoon Public Library was opened in 1990 and went through a major refurbishment in 2017. Yeppoon is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region following a local government amalgamation that was reversed in 2014). Heritage listings Yeppoon has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * James Street: Yeppoon railway station * Normanby Street: Yeppoon War Memorial * 29 Queen Street: Yeppoon State School building Governance In 1879, the Gogango Division was established as one of 74 divisions in Queensland under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. The Gogango Divisional Board's scope of authority comprised a large area north and east of Rockhampton. While the Division was administered in Rockhampton, a locally appointed body, the Yeppoon Progress Association, met once a month to look after the minor requirements of the town. The discovery of gold brought a huge influx of people to the region, and the various Boards broke up into smaller administrative bodies to better service the growing population. In 1903, the Gogango Divisional Board was renamed Shire of Livingstone. The boundaries of the new shire remained largely unchanged until 1984, when outlying districts including the suburbs of Nerimbera and Parkhurst were ceded to Livingstone's larger neighbour, City of Rockhampton. Continued growth in both Local Government Authorities became a contentious subject from then on, which caused much political tension, until finally in 2007, local conflicts came to a head with the tabling before the Parliament of Queensland of the proposed Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007. The Act passed, and on 15 March 2008, Livingstone Shire merged with Fitzroy Shire, Mount Morgan Shire, and Rockhampton City to form the new local government area, Rockhampton Region. This forced amalgamation has caused political tension, but a heated and public campaign for the reinstatement of Livingstone Shire as a separate LGA has had little impact or interest from the general public. Particularly in localities in outlying areas, there is an equal and perhaps more vocal argument that the old LGA was too \\"Yeppoon-centric\\". On 1 January 2014 the Shire of Livingstone was re-established with its 2008 boundaries with its seat at Yeppoon. Climate The Capricorn Coast experiences a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa/Cwa). Due to its location in the southern tropics, the Capricorn Coast experiences hot summers without the extreme humidity of Far North Queensland, and mild winters Shopping Yeppoon has a number of shopping centres. *Cedar Park Plaza, Taranganba *Yeppoon Central *Keppel Bay Plaza *Yeppoon CBD *Tanby Road District Healthcare * Capricorn Coast Hospital Education *Yeppoon State School is a government co- educational primary school (P-6) in Tucker Street.

His official Taoist name is \\"Marshal of the Central Altar\\" (). He was then given the title \\"Third Lotus Prince\\" () after he became a deity. Origins baby Krishna displayed during Janmashtami celebrations. Na Tcha Temple of the Centre of Macau, a Nezha temple behind the Ruins of St. Paul, in Macau. According to Meir Shahar, Nezha is ultimately based on two figures from Hindu mythology. The first is a yaksha from the Ramayana named Nalakubar, the son of Yaksha King Kubera and nephew of the antagonist Ravana. The link to Nalakubar is established through variants in his Chinese name appearing in Buddhist sutras. The original variant Naluojiupoluo () changed to Naluojubaluo (), Nazhajuwaluo (), and finally Nazha (). The simple addition of the \\"mouth radical\\" () to Na () changes the name to the current form Nezha (). The second figure is the child god Krishna. Both Krishna and Nezha are powerful children that defeat mighty serpents, Kaliya in the case of the former and Ao Bing in the latter. The Bhagavata Purana describes how Nalakubar was rescued from imprisonment within a tree by Krishna. A 10th-century Tantric Buddhist sutra mentions a child god that seems to be an amalgam of Krishna and Nalakubar called Nana (). In addition, Nalakubar's father Kubera was eventually absorbed into the Buddhist pantheon as the Heavenly King Vai≈õrava·πáa. Shahar notes that Vaisravana was somehow connected to the historical Tang Dynasty general Li Jing. This explains the name and position of Nezha's father, the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li Jing. Story According to Fengshen Yanyi, Nezha was born during the Shang dynasty in a military fortress at Chentang Pass. His father was a military commander named Li Jing, who later became the \\"Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King\\". Nezha's mother, Lady Yin, gave birth to a ball of flesh after being pregnant with him for three years and six months. Li Jing thought that his wife had given birth to a demon and attacked the ball with his sword. The ball split open and Nezha jumped out as a boy instead of an infant. Nezha could speak and walk immediately after birth. He was later accepted by the immortal Taiyi Zhenren as a student. He had two older brothers, Jinzha, a disciple of Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun, and Muzha. One day, the people of Chentang Pass asked for rain, and sacrificed much food to the East Sea Dragon King Ao Guang. The King rejected the food, instead wanting girls and boys to eat. He sent Ye Sha to capture for him a girl and boy. Nezha and two other children were playing by the sea when Ye Sha appeared and captured one of Nezha's friends. Nezha then fought him and injured him severely, causing him to return to the King and beg for someone else to take care of Nezha. The Dragon King sent Ao Bing, his third son, but the latter was slain by Nezha. Ao Guang called for his brothers and confronted Nezha and his family. He threatened to flood Chentang Pass and report Nezha to the Jade Emperor. To save his family and the people, Nezha committed suicide himself then carving up his own flesh and dismembering his bones \\"returning\\" these to his parents in repayment for the debt of his birth. The Dragon Kings then hosted a huge celebration. After Nezha had committed suicide to return his body to his parents, he appeared in his mother's dream. In the dream, he asked her to build a temple for him, so that his soul would have a place to rest. This constitutes a link to Nezha's birth because the night before Nezha was born, Lady Yin had a dream where a Taoist put something into her bosom and told her to take this child. For both incidences, a dream was used to communicate a message. His mother then secretly built a temple for Nezha and this temple later flourished. This temple became very well known and grew vastly because Nezha granted miracle cures to the sick and the crippled. However, Li Jing soon found out about this temple and burnt it down because he was still angry at Nezha and felt that he had already caused too much trouble for their family. Li Jing burning the temple caused Nezha to desire his father's death. Thus, enmity between father and son grew. Nezha was later brought back to life by his teacher, Taiyi Zhenren, who used lotus roots to construct a human body for his soul and gave him two new weapons: the Wind Fire Wheels () and the Fire-tipped Spear (). With the reincarnation of Nezha by his master, Li Jing and Nezha fought many battles. However, Li Jing soon realized that his mortal body was no match for Nezha and so he ran for his life. On the run, he met his second son, Muzha, who fought and was defeated by Nezha. At this, Li Jing tried to commit suicide but was saved by Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun, who also contained Nezha. In the end, Nezha was forced to submit to his father by another deity, Randeng Daoren. Nezha is often depicted as a youth, instead of an adult. He is often shown flying in the sky riding on the Wind Fire Wheels (), has the Universe Ring () around his body (sometimes in his left hand), the Red Armillary Sash () around his shoulders and a Fire-tipped Spear () in his right hand. Sometimes, he is shown in his \\"three heads and six arms\\" form (). He has the ability to spit rainbows in some legends. In mythology and literature Nezha has frequently appeared in Chinese mythology and ancient Chinese literature such as Fengshen Yanyi (or Investiture of the Gods), although the story of Nezha Conquering the Sea is the most well known among Chinese households. In Journey to the West, Nezha was a general under his father, \\"Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King\\" Li Jing. He fought the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, when the latter rebelled against the Jade Emperor. They later became friends. Nezha made some appearances in the novel to help the four protagonists defeat powerful demons including his adoptive sister, Lady Earth Flow.  Nezha in other media  = Film and television = Nezha as a Google Doodle on Google Hong Kong. Nezha has been the central character in over 20 different films and television programs,http://www.hkmdb.com/db/search/results/WrLOqQ8w9q4IciKZ7H1oIg-1.mhtml both live-action and animated, dating back at least as early as a pre- communist Chinese live-action feature film, N√©zhƒÅ Ch≈´sh√¨ (), produced by the Great Wall Film Company and premiered, according to differing accounts, in either 1927https://baike.baidu.com/item/Âì™ÂêíÂá∫‰∏ñ/15984522 or 1928.https://movie.douban.com/subject/26413854/ In addition he has appeared as a supporting character in numerous others, chiefly among the many adaptations of Investiture of the Gods and Journey to the West. The character increased in popularity in 1979 with the traditionally-animated feature film Nezha Conquers the Dragon King, which was screened at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival and is considered one of the great classic works of Chinese animation. On 30 May 2014, Google paid homage to this film with an animated doodle on their Hong Kong search engine's homepage. In 2003, China Central Television began the broadcast of a new children's traditionally-animated series The Legend of Nezha,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6866732/mediaviewer/rm2022385920 which originally ran from 2003 to 2004, for a total of 52 episodes. In 2016, a stereoscopic, computer-animated feature film, I Am Nezha, was released in China.https://movie.douban.com/subject/26820458/ On 26 July 2019, another stereoscopic, computer-animated feature film, Ne Zha,() was more successful, setting numerous all-time records for box-office grosses, including third- highest-grossing of all films in China and highest-grossing animated film from outside the United States. A comment from www.fjsen.com says, Based on the previous work, the film is bold and innovative, which not only retains the essence of Chinese traditional culture, but also adds popular elements, making the culture to be displayed more easily accepted by the audience. It breaks the stereotype, emphasises self independence, and gives consideration to the reality with metaphor. There are many scenes which reflect on the secular and ugly sides of the society in the film. Compared with the truth, many people are more willing to believe in hearsay and then look at people with coloured glasses. Nezha, a rebellious superhero, though seemingly rebellious to tradition, still retain the most positive passion and moving, still have the value orientation of Chinese culture of dedication and responsibility. A 2017 announcement from the leadership of Hasbro confirmed that Nezha will appear in a crossover with the Transformers franchise. The series, titled Nezha: Transformers, consists of 52 11-minute episodes and is produced by Allspark Animation and China Central Television.https://news.tfw2005.com/2019/11/06/transformers-nezha-episode- count-and-running-time-revealed-400158 The character has also been evoked outside of the fantasy genre, in realistic contemporary and period drama films as a byword for a rebellious, nonconformist young person, such as in Rebels of the Neon God (, 1992),https://movie.douban.com/subject/1307561/ Spin Kid (, 2011),https://movie.douban.com/subject/6861622/ Nezha (, 2014)https://movie.douban.com/subject/24753687/ and Operation Mekong (2016, in which a character is codenamed Nezha). = Video games = Nezha is a playable character in Koei Tecmo's crossover series Warriors Orochi. The series features two different versions of Nezha, a cyborg and his human self. Ne Zha is a playable character in the multiplayer online battle arena video game Smite, where he is a melee assassin. On December 16, 2015, third-person shooter action game Warframe released a playable character named and themed after Nezha. Nezha is also a collectible character in Netmarble's mobile RPG Seven Knights where the character, while depicted as female, retains much of Nezha's mythos and characteristics. Nezha is also a summonable Heroic Spirit in the popular Japanese hero collector game Fate/Grand Order where he can be summoned as a Lancer class Servant. In the game he is depicted as female, who speaks in a short, robotic tone. It is revealed that their original male body was used to create Xiang Yu. Nezha is also a summonable Astromon in the Korean creature capture game Monster Super League developed by 4:33 and Creative Labs. In the game he is depicted as female. Religion Nezha is worshipped in Chinese folk religion and is called \\"Marshal of the Central Altar\\" or \\"Prince Nezha\\", the \\"Third Prince\\". As in traditional folklore, Nezha flies around swiftly on his wind fire wheels, so he is also regarded as the tutelary god of many professional drivers, like trucks, taxis, or sightseeing bus drivers. They tend to place a small statue of Nezha in the vehicles for a safe drive. Nezha is also often regarded as the patron god of children and filial piety. Parents would make an offering to Nezha with the hope that their children would grow up strong, healthy, and be dutiful and respectful.

Biography Born in Buffalo, New York, and a graduate of that city's Lafayette High School, Reidpath became a collegiate track star at Syracuse University, winning the 220 yd (201 m) and 440 yd (402 m) dashes in the 1912 intercollegiate games. On graduating from Syracuse in 1912 with a degree in civil engineering, Reidpath was pressured by relatives to quit sports and take a position with the family business in Buffalo. Instead, he made the U.S. Olympic track team, and headed to Stockholm, Sweden. Reidpath won the 400 m in an Olympic record shattering time of 48.2 seconds, a mark also ratified as a world record. Running the anchor leg of the 4 √ó 400 m relay, Reidpath helped the U.S. team set a world record of 3:16.6. In the 200 metres competition he finished fifth. Reidpath was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army who served in England, France and Belgium in the Transportation Corps during World War II, winning battle stars for the Northern France and Rheinland campaigns. In Belgium he was made Officer of the Crown for his services at the vital port of Antwerp in 1944 and 1945. Reidpath was made a Brigadier General when he retired from the New York National Guard in 1948. He is a member of the Lafayette High School Sports Hall of fame. Away from sports and the military, Reidpath worked for the Berdencer construction company from 1912 through 1937, when he was named director of buildings for Buffalo. For 15 years he worked in the city department of public works, and in 1956 helped build the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Buffalo Branch as superintendent of construction for architects. He died in Kenmore, New York, in 1975.

He won the controversial 400 m race at the 1908 Summer Olympics, becoming the only athlete to win an Olympic title by a walkover. Halswelle was also an infantry officer who served in the Second Boer War and World War I. He was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915. Early life Born in London to London-born, Edinburgh-trained artist Keeley Halswelle and Helen Marianna Elizabeth Gordon, he is nonetheless usually referred to as being Scottish, the nationality of his maternal grandfather, General Nathaniel J. Gordon. Wyndham Halswelle had a notable athletic career at Charterhouse School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the Highland Light Infantry in 1901. While his regiment was in South Africa in 1902 for the Second Boer War, Halswelle's ability was recognised by Jimmy Curran, a coach and amateur athlete. It was he who persuaded Halswelle to take up athletics seriously when his regiment returned to Edinburgh in 1904. Domestic athletics In 1904 he was army champion for 880 yards, and in 1905 he won the Scottish and AAA 440 yard (402 m) titles. In the 1906 Athens Intercalated Olympics, he achieved a silver medal in the 400 metres and a bronze in the 800 metres. On his return, in a single afternoon in 1906 at the Scottish championships in Powderhall, he won the 100, 220, 440 and 880 yards races (91, 201, 402, 805 m), a feat that has not been matched since. His season was cut short by a leg injury in 1907, but he came back the following year to set a world record of 31.2 s for 300 yards (274 m) and a British record over 440 yards of 48.4 s that lasted over a quarter of a century until it was eventually broken by Godfrey Rampling. In 1908 he set a Scottish 300 yards record that lasted until 1961 when it was beaten by Menzies Campbell, then a Glasgow University student. 1908 Summer Olympics In 1908 Summer Olympics, Halswelle reached the final of the 400 m with the fastest qualifying time (an Olympic record of 48.4 s). The 400 m was not run in lanes at this point. Halswelle was baulked by William Robbins in the first 50 m. Then, coming off the final bend, Robbins led John Carpenter by a yard, with Halswelle waiting to pass him in the last straight, as he had done to other athletes in the earlier rounds. Carpenter ran wide, forcing Halswelle to within eighteen inches of the outside of the track, using his right elbow to prevent Halswelle overtaking. British umpire Roscoe Badger observed that Carpenter manoeuvred so as to prevent Halswelle from passing him. While blocking competitors was an acceptable strategy in the United States, it was prohibited by the British rules under which the 1908 London Olympics were organised. Badger immediately signalled the judges to declare the race void. Pictures of the race indicate that Carpenter (intentionally or not) blocked Halswelle. Carpenter was disqualified, and the race was ordered to be rerun in lanes two days later; however, the other two U.S. runners refused to race, so a reluctant Halswelle ran the race by himself to win the gold in a time of 50.2 s. It is the only occasion in Olympic history where the final was a walkover. As a result of the controversy, from the next Olympics in 1912 onwards all 400 metre races were run in lanes, and the International Amateur Athletic Federation was founded to establish uniform worldwide rules for athletics. The controversy soured Halswelle's view of athletics. He was also under pressure from his senior officers, who felt he was being exploited, and he retired from athletics after a farewell appearance at the 1908 Glasgow Rangers Sports. Death Halswelle, by then a captain, was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in France, during World War I, on 31 March 1915 aged 32 while attempting to rescue an injured fellow officer. Earlier in the same battle (12 March) he was hit by shrapnel or shell fragments while leading his men across an area known as Layes Brook but despite his wounds he refused to be evacuated and continued at the front, although heavily bandaged. In the issue of the HLI regimental magazine that announced his death also appeared a piece he wrote days before it. It described a battle where 79 of his fellow soldiers died to gain 15 yards: > \\"I called on the men to get over the parapet... There is great difficulty in > getting out of a trench, especially for small men laden with a pack, rifle > and perhaps 50 rounds in the pouch, and a bandolier of 50 rounds hung around > them, and perhaps four feet of slippery clay perpendicular wall with > sandbags on the top. I got about three men hit actually on top of the > parapet. I made a dash at the parapet and fell back. The Jocks then heaved > me up and I jumped into a ditch ‚Äì an old trench filled with liquid mud ‚Äì > which took me some time to get out of.\\" His grave was marked with a wooden cross, with his name in charcoal. Later his remains were re-interred in the Royal Irish Rifles Graveyard at Laventie, near Armenti√®res. CWGC Casualty Record. In 2003, he was posthumously inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame. His Olympic medals and other trophies are displayed there. Halswelle's regiment, now the Royal Highland Fusiliers, awards the Wyndham Halswelle Memorial Trophy to the winner of the 400m at the Scottish under-20 championships.

Sahlin was a Member of Parliament, representing Stockholm County, from 1982 to 1996 and again from 2002 to 2011. She has also held various ministerial posts in the Swedish government from 1990 to 1991, from 1994 to 1995 and from 1998 to 2006. Sahlin was elected new leader of the Social Democratic Party on 17 March 2007, succeeding G√∂ran Persson who resigned as leader following the defeat in the 2006 general election. Sahlin is the first female leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and became in 2011 the first since Claes Tholin in 1907 to leave that position without having served as Prime Minister of Sweden. In 2012, her successor H√•kan Juholt joined her as the second now living person to do so. On 14 November 2010, following another electoral defeat for the Social Democrats, she announced her intent to step down as party chairman, which she did in early 2011.  Youth and education  Sahlin was born Mona Ingeborg Andersson in Sollefte√•, V√§sternorrland County, Sweden. Her father, Hans Andersson, worked at different ungdomsv√•rdsskolor (community homes or reformatories), forcing the family to move frequently. In the mid 1960s they moved to J√§rla in Stockholm County where they remained. Her father later became an advisor to former Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson. In 1964, at the age of seven, Sahlin founded the Swedish \\"Barbie Club\\" (Barbieklubben). During her childhood she also enjoyed soccer and music. In Melodifestivalen 1969 (the selection for the song to represent Sweden at the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest) Sahlin performed as one of the back up singers to Jan Malmsj√∂. The song was written by Benny Andersson and Lasse Berghagen and it came in second place. Sahlin was educated at Nacka Samskola and S√∂dra Latin in Stockholm and completed secondary school in 1977. From 1976 to 1977 she was vice chairperson of the Swedish Pupils' Association (). Thereafter she worked at a private company and later as a trade union representative for the Swedish National Union of State Employees.  Political career  At age 13, Sahlin joined the Swedish support group for the Viet Cong. Sahlin's political career began in the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League in Nacka, Stockholm County, in 1973, at the age of 16. This was during the Vietnam War, and already as a 13-year-old Sahlin had joined the Swedish FNL group. In the Swedish general election of 1982 Sahlin was elected to the Riksdag as the youngest member of parliament at that time. In 1990, she became Minister for Employment, but after the Social Democrats lost power in the 1991 election, Sahlin began to serve as chairman of the Riksdag's Committee on the Labour Market and as spokesman for the Social Democrats on labour market issues. From 1992 to 1994 she was party secretary. During this period, she openly criticized government reforms, particularly on social welfare and employees' rights, maintaining they needed to be reversed. She left her position to rejoin the government as Minister for Gender Equality and Deputy Prime Minister, when the Social Democrats regained power in the 1994 election. In October 1995, the newspaper Expressen following an investigation led by Christian Democratic Spanish-Swedish Public Auditor Carlos Medina de Rebolledo revealed that Sahlin, who was then serving as Deputy Prime Minister and was widely seen as the main candidate to succeed Ingvar Carlsson as Prime Minister, had charged more than 50,000 Swedish kronor for private expenses on her working charge card, which was only for working expenses. At a news conference she admitted that she had used a Government credit card to buy groceries. She further confessed to having failed to pay 19 parking tickets and several bills for her children's day care on time. Later, she apologized in a Stockholm newspaper. A preliminary investigation was initiated by the chief prosecutor Jan Danielsson, as a result of the transactions, and was closed in early 1996 when it came to the conclusion that there was no infringement. She eventually paid the bills (and an extra of 15,000 kronor) to the Treasury. The controversy was dubbed as the \\"Toblerone affair\\" due to the inclusion of Toblerone bars on the credit card statement. = Break from politics and return = From 1996 to 1997, Sahlin worked as a self-employed owner of a small company and as a television reporter. In 1997 she was elected chairman of the European Council Against Racism and in 1998 she became the head of the Social Democratic youth education school Bommersvik. Sahlin returned to national politics in 1998 when then Prime Minister G√∂ran Persson appointed her as Minister without Portfolio. She served first in the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communication from 1998 to 2002, then from 2002 to 2004 in the Ministry of Justice as the \\"Minister for Democracy and Integration\\", and from 2004 to 2006 in the Ministry of Sustainable Development as the \\"Minister for Sustainable Development\\". In 2004, she was the Social Democratic minister for integration of refugees and her public positions indicated an opposition to proposed restrictions on asylum seekers, arguing the all refugees entering Sweden must have the same rights and obligations. = Social Democratic Party leadership = After the Social Democratic defeat in the 2006 election, G√∂ran Persson announced his retirement as party leader on the election night. It was clear that the party now wanted a female leader. Mona Sahlin was mentioned as a possible successor, but not considered to be the most likely candidate. Both Margot Wallstr√∂m and Carin J√§mtin received stronger support amongst local and regional party organisations. Ulrica Messing was also mentioned as a possible candidate. Wallstr√∂m, J√§mtin and Messing declared however that they would not stand for the post and instead supported Sahlin, leaving Mona Sahlin as the only serious candidate. On 18 January she was officially asked by the party's Election Committee to stand as party leader, and accepted. On 17 March she was unanimously elected at the extra party congress in Stockholm. In January 2007, support for the new centre-right government of Sweden had dropped greatly in the polls, which showed the left bloc (including the Green Party) as having much stronger support. This provided Mona Sahlin, as leader of the biggest opposition party, with excellent opportunities to lead the opposition against the PM Fredrik Reinfeldt. By April 2009 however, the support had waned and a Demoskop poll published in Expressen showed that the four-party Alliance claimed a combined 50 percent voter support while the Sahlin-led opposition had 45.2 percent. Later the same month a Sifo poll showed that merely 27 percent of Swedes were confident or extremely confident in her leadership ability, while the public confidence in Reinfeldt was measured at 60 percent. Mona Sahlin (second from the right) and the top Social Democratic Party candidates for the European Parliament elections in 2009. Mona Sahlin is often described as a scion of the party's more moderate members, and a number of left-wing party members criticised her candidacy for party leader. Much of this criticism was silenced in January 2007 when the chairman of the Trade Union Confederation, Wanja Lundby-Wedin, expressed full support for Sahlin as well as several powerful party districts around the country. One of her key initiatives was the formation of the Red-Green alliance between the Social Democrats and the Green Party to counter the move to pare back the social welfare system and privatize state-owned assets. In the election to the European Parliament held on 7 June 2009 ‚Äì Sahlin's first election as party leader ‚Äì the Social Democratic Party received 24.41 percent of the votes (a slight reduction from the 2004 election in which the party received 24.56 percent). The result was the lowest for the Social Democratic Party since the introduction of universal suffrage in Sweden in 1921. In a speech before trade unionists during the election campaign on 12 May 2009, Sahlin said: \\"If there's not a plus in front of our figures it's a deep failure\\". She led the Social Democratic Party in the election of September 2010 where she failed to unseat Fredrik Reinfeldt as Prime Minister. The Social Democrats received the lowest recorded percentage of the votes in their long history but were still the largest party in Sweden by a slim margin in 2010. She resigned as party leader on 25 March 2011, becoming the second Social Democratic Party leader to have resigned without having served as prime minister. Speaking in 2005 at a Swedish mosque, Sahlin said that \\"many Swedes are envious of immigrants because they have a culture, a history, something that binds them together. Swedes have only Midsummer Night and such silly things.\\" Karen Jespersen, a former Minister of Integration in Denmark, commented: Cultural self-denial cannot easily be more monstrous and ghastly.\\"Svensk kultur en saga blott?; Human Rights Service; April 22, 2005; https://www.rights.no/hrs_skrib_gen/arkiv/hrs_65.60_0504.22_106.htm After the terrorist action in Brussels in March 2016, Sahlin, who was then serving as national coordinator against violent extremism, maintained in an op-ed that such atrocities were the fault not only of the terrorists themselves but of critics of Islam whose remarks in online chat rooms, in comments fields, and on social media \\"give the extremists their nourishment.\\"Sahlin, Mona; ‚ÄùSverige befinner sig p√• ett sluttande plan‚Äù; Dagens Samh√§lle; March 22, 2016; https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/debatt/sverige-befinner-sig-pa-ett-sluttande- plan-23711 Commentator Jenny Sonesson called for her to be dismissed from her position, saying that she \\"knows nothing about Islam.\\" Writing in Expressen, Sakine Madon also criticized Sahlin for her refusal to address the reality of jihadism. On May 5, 2016, Sahlin stepped down from her position as Sweden's national coordinator against violence-embracing extremism, due to revelations by the newspaper Expressen that she had lied about her bodyguard's salary, in order to help him secure a mortgage. The bodyguard had a monthly salary of 43 000 SEK, but Mona Sahlin wrote a confirmation letter stating that he had a salary of 120 000 SEK. When confronted with the issue, she first made a false statement that she had paid the difference out of her own pocket, before retracting the statement after it was proven by Expressen to actually be false. Media were quick to point out similarities to the so-called Toblerone case of the 1990s when Sahlin was caught using her government credit card to pay for private expenses and then dodging the issue when confronted.Expressen: Mona Sahlin avg√•r efter avsl√∂jandet. 4 May 2016. In November 2017, Sahlin was found guilty of tax evasion. In 2015 she had failed to declare 151,072 kronor in income from writing and lecturing, and in 2016 she had failed to declare 106.193 kronor. She was required to pay a fine of 23,000 kronor.Mona Sahlin straffas f√∂r skattebrott; SVT Nyheter; https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/mona-sahlin-straffas-for-skattebrott  Personal life  Mona Sahlin has one brother and two sisters. Her brother, Janne \\"Japop\\" Andersson, used to be the lead singer of the pop group Japop and owns his own production company. Her sister Lena (Ridemar) is director of negotiation at the Swedish Union of Tenants () and her other sister works at SEB (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken). In 1976, Sahlin met the Chilean David Pe√±a at a Social Democrat youth camp in Kramfors. Their daughter Ann-Sofie was born in 1978, but the relationship only lasted for a few years. In 1982 she married her current husband Bo Sahlin, with whom she has had three children: Jenny (b. 1983), Gustav (b. 1989), and Johan who died after ten months as a result of heart failure.

He was best known for having leaked documents about the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano in the Falklands War. At the time of his resignation from the civil service in 1985, he was a Grade 5 (assistant secretary), earning ¬£23,000 per year. He wrote a number of books on British and world history. His most influential works include a Green History of the World (1991), which was revised as A New Green History of the World in 2007, and a biography of Winston Churchill (1994) and 1940: Myth and Reality (1990). Two reviewers referred to him as a revisionist historian.The China-Burma-India Campaign, 1931-1945: Historiography and Annotated Bibliography by Eugene L. Rasor, pub Greenwood, 1998, p. 91. Hi Hitler;, by Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, pub Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 34. Early life Ponting was born in Bristol. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and the University of Reading. Bureaucratic career =General Belgrano papers= While a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Ponting sent two documents, subsequently nicknamed \\"the crown jewels\\",; ; to Labour MP Tam Dalyell in July 1984 concerning the sinking of the Argentine navy warship General Belgrano, a key incident in the 1982 Falklands War. After Ponting admitted revealing the information, the Ministry of Defence suspended him without pay. On 17 August 1985, he was charged with a criminal offence under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act of 1911. The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had his pay reinstated once she had been briefed on what had happened. Ponting's defence at the trial was that the matter and its disclosure to a Member of Parliament were in the public interest.BBC, Clive Ponting case: Where is the investigators' report?, by Martin Rosenbaun, 18 March 2011. It was the first case under the Official Secrets Act that involved giving information to Parliament. Although Ponting expected to be imprisoned, he was acquitted by the jury. The acquittal came despite the judge's direction to the jury‚Äîand hence by definition a \\"perverse verdict\\". The judge, Sir Anthony McCowan, \\"had indicated that the jury should convict him\\". In 1985 Ponting came across the one file about Operation Cauldron‚Äî1952 secret biological warfare trials that had led to a trawler being accidentally doused with plague bacteria off the Hebrides‚Äîthat had not been destroyed, and confidentially told The Observer newspaper about it, leading to a story that July headlined British germ bomb sprayed trawler. Ponting resigned from the civil service on 16 February 1985. In May 1987 he made an extended appearance on the first ever edition of Channel 4's After Dark discussion programme. =Charges under the Official Secrets Act= Shortly after his resignation, The Observer began to serialise Ponting's book The Right to Know: The Inside Story of the Belgrano Affair. The Conservative government reacted by amending the secrets legislation and by introducing the Official Secrets Act 1989. Before the trial, a jury could take the view that if an action could be seen to be in the public interest, the right of the individual to take that action might be justified. As a result of the 1989 modification, that defence was removed. After the enactment, it was taken that public interest' is what the government of the day says it is\\". Academic career Following his resignation from the Civil Service, Ponting served as a reader in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Wales, Swansea, until his retirement in 2004. He was one of the pioneers of big history. His historical works have attracted significant attention and often courted unfavourable reviews in the United Kingdom because of the controversial positions he has taken, but international reviews and more recent reviews have been favourable.https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1994/eirv21n21-19940520/eirv21n21-19940520_041-new_british_research_exposes_chu.pdf As one later reviewer wrote, describing the impact of his biographical work, \\"Ponting shattered the Churchill illusion for his readers leaving them little to piece together, just marble shards on the floor of his looted temple\\".CJ Coventry, Clive Ponting's Churchill, Before/Now, 1(1) (2019), https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:23811/ Personal life Ponting was married four times. In 1969 he married Katherine Hannan. After their divorce he married Sally Fletcher who also worked in the MoD. Ponting's second and third marriages ended in divorce. His fourth wife, Diane Johnson, died before him in 2020. Retirement Ponting retired in 2004 and moved to a Greek island, but his health drove him back to a house in France, then to Kelso in the Scottish Borders. He joined the Scottish National Party in 2018. He gave a speech in which he warned party members that a disastrous Brexit would be used as context in which to disband or constrain the Scottish Parliament. He died on 28 July 2020.

Ponting's concern in the book is to provide a revisionist perspective to correct for what he perceives as the dominant bias in conventional historical narrative towards ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and the expansion of Europe (in effect, an ingrained Eurocentrism).

Located north of the centre of Brisbane in South East Queensland, on the Coral Sea coastline, its urban area spans approximately of coastline and hinterland from Pelican Waters to Tewantin. The estimated urban population of Sunshine Coast as of June 2018 was 333,436, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. making it the 9th most populous in the country. The population of the area has grown steadily at an average annual rate of 2.4% year-on-year over the five years to 2018. The area was first settled by Papuasians migrating from northern Australia. Europeans settled in the area in the 19th century, with development progressing slowly until tourism became an important industry. The area has several coastal hubs at Caloundra, Kawana Waters, Maroochydore and Noosa Heads. Nambour and Maleny have developed as primary commercial centres for the hinterland, although Maleny falls outside the urban area defined by the ABS that this article refers to. The Sunshine Coast, as a term recognised by most Australians, is the district defined in 1967 as \\"the area contained in the Shires of Landsborough, Maroochy and Noosa, but excluding Bribie Island\\". Its use is frequently colloquial, however. Since 2014, the Sunshine Coast district has been split into two local government areas, the Sunshine Coast Region and the Shire of Noosa, which administer the southern and northern parts of the Sunshine Coast respectively. History The earliest residents of the Sunshine Coast were the indigenous Gubbi Gubbi and Wakka Wakka people.Mathew, J. (1910). Two representative tribes of Queensland. London: T. Fisher Unwin The territory of the Kabi included about along the coastline from the 27th parallel northward to the mouth of the Burrum River. The country of the Wakka Wakka people was about that was roughly triangular to the west of the Kabi, including a small part of the Dawson, and meeting the northern Kabi boundary at Walla. The two tribes were friendly and intermarried and has the same class restrictions. The groups were nomadic, gathering food en-route as they moved from one campsite to the next. Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Sunshine Coast Region and Gympie Region, particularly the towns of Caloundra, Noosa Heads, Gympie and extending north towards Maryborough and south to Caboolture. Log rafting on the Noosa River, 1889 Pineapple plantation in the 1930s Mount Beerwah is part of the Glass House Mountains National Park In 1770, James Cook on the deck of HM Bark Endeavour became the first known European to sight the Glass House Mountains, located south-west of Caloundra. In the 1820s, former convicts, John Finnegan, Thomas Pamphlett and Richard Parsons landed on Moreton Island after becoming hopelessly lost fetching cedar. They lived with the Kabi Kabi) for eight months. Thereafter, during the 1830s to 1840s, the district became home to numerous runaway convicts from the Moreton Bay (Brisbane) penal colony slightly to the south. In 1842, Governor George Gipps had the entire Sunshine Coast and hinterland from Mt Beerwah north to roughly Eumundi declared a \\"Bunya Bunya Reserve\\" for the protection of the bunya tree after Andrew Petrie advised him of the importance of bunya groves in Aboriginal culture. However, during the 1840s and 1850s, the Bunya Bunya Reserve and its vicinity became the scene of some of the most bitter skirmishes of Australia's \\"Black War\\". The Blackall Range, on account of the tri-annual Bunya Festival, served as both a hideout and rallying point for attacks against white settlement. By the 1850s timber cutters and cattlemen had started exploiting the area; in 1860 the Bunya Bunya Reserve was scrapped. Many of the Sunshine Coast's towns began as simple ports or jetties for the timber industry during the 1860s and 1870s, as the area once had magnificent stands of forest. Likewise, the region's roads often began as snigging tracks for hauling timber. Timbergetters used the region's creeks, rivers and lakes as seaways to float out their logs of cedar ‚Äì the resultant wood being shipped as far afield as Europe. During the Gympie Gold Rush (1867), prospectors scaled the Sunshine Coast mountains to develop easier roadways to and from the gold fields of Gympie. After construction of the railway line to Gympie, the coastal and river towns, being mostly ports for the early river-trade, were bypassed. By the 1890s, diverse small-farming (fruit and dairy) had replaced the cattle-and-timber economy of earlier decades. Sugar cane and pineapples proved especially important produce for the district. Many small hamlets and towns now emerged. Produce was initially taken by horse to Landsborough, then to Eudlo in 1891. Especially after World War II, the Sunshine Coast grew into a favoured holiday and surfing destination. This tendency was further expanded in the development boom of the 1960s and 1970s. Around the same time, various tourist/theme parks were created ‚Äì the most iconic being the Big Pineapple in Woombye. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Sunshine Coast also attracted persons drawn to alternative lifestyles. These newcomers developed a range of craft industries, co-operatives and spiritual centres, particularly in the hinterlands. After the 1980s, the Sunshine Coast experienced rapid population growth. it had become one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. As the region becomes increasingly residential, most of the district's distinctive small farms ‚Äì especially tropical-fruit and sugar-cane farms have disappeared, as have most of its theme parks. The Moreton sugar mills closure in 2003 removed a market for the district's 120 cane growers who had been harvesting cane in the region. Instead, businesses concerned with retail, catering and tourism have assumed increasing importance. In 2008, The Shire of Noosa, Shire of Maroochy and City of Caloundra merged to form the Sunshine Coast Region. The 2007 referendum conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and leading to the merger remained controversial in Noosa Shire, where 95% of voters had rejected amalgamation. In March 2013, a second referendum resulted in 81% of residents voted to leave the amalgamated Sunshine Coast Region. On 9 November 2013 an election resulted in Noel Playford being elected to take office as mayor on 1 January 2014 with the new council.ecq.qld.gov.au ‚Äì 013 Noosa Shire Council ‚Äì Mayoral Election ‚Äì 10 November 2013 The Shire of Noosa was re-established on 1 January 2014. This resulted in two geopolitical areas occupying the area generally recognised as 'The Sunshine Coast'. The Sunshine Coast Region, governed by the Sunshine Coast Council and the Shire of Noosa, governed by Noosa Shire Council. Geography Caloundra, Bribie Island and the Glass House Mountains, 2012 Australia Zoo, 2007 Major rivers of the Sunshine Coast include Noosa River, Maroochy River, Mooloolah River and the Stanley River. The region includes several lakes such as Lake Cootharaba and Lake Weyba. Ewen Maddock Dam, Wappa Dam and Baroon Pocket Dam have been built for water storage. =Beaches= Several stretches of the Sunshine Coast are lined with unbroken beaches ‚Äì from Sunshine Beach near Noosa to Coolum Beach (); the coast from Point Arkwright to Mudjimba (); the Maroochydore‚ÄìMooloolaba stretch (); and from Buddina past the Caloundra CBD to Pelican Waters (). Notable beaches include: * Noosa Main Beach * Sunshine Beach in Noosa * Sunrise Beach in Noosa * Castaways Beach in Noosa * Marcus Beach in Noosa * Peregian Beach in Noosa * Coolum Beach, Maroochydore * Marcoola, Maroochydore * Mudjimba, Maroochydore * Alexandra Headland, Maroochydore * Mooloolaba (the spit), Maroochydore * Kawana Waters, between Maroochydore and Caloundra * Dicky Beach in Caloundra * Moffat Beach in Caloundra * Shelly Beach in Caloundra * Kings Beach in Caloundra * Golden Beach in Caloundra =National parks= The Sunshine Coast is home to more individual national parks than any other region in Queensland. The natural biodiversity of the area has been protected by five separate parks in both coastal and inland regions, including Mapleton Falls National Park, Kondalilla National Park, The Glass House Mountains National Park, Noosa National Park, and the Great Sandy National Park, which includes sections on Fraser Island and in Cooloola near Rainbow Beach. Climate Sunshine Coast has a humid subtropical climate typical of South Queensland. Summers are generally hot, but moderated compared to areas on similar latitudes elsewhere. Winters retain warm days, but have cooler nights rendering it falling into the subtropical fold. There is no dry season and precipitation is generally quite high. The average temperature of the sea ranges from in August to in February at Mooloolaba, and from in August to in February at Noosa Heads. Economy The Sunshine Coast economy has outpaced most of the regional economies in Australia in terms of growth over the last 15 years. The strength of the regional economy is based in its diversity and strength across a number of key sectors including healthcare, education, finance and professional business services. =Tourism= The Sunshine Coast is a centre for tourism, attracting more than 3.2 million visitors a year. There are significant attractions, such as Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo, UnderWater World marine park, Aussie World with the Ettamogah Pub, the Buderim Ginger Factory, the Big Pineapple, the Eumundi Markets and the Majestic Theatre, Pomona. Sports tourism is supported by several annual sporting events such as the Mooloolaba Triathlon, Noosa Triathlon and Sunshine Coast Marathon.Sunshine Coast Marathon . Retrieved 19 July 2014. =Agriculture= In 2017‚Äì18, the gross value of agricultural production in the Sunshine Coast region was $217 million, which was 2 per cent of the total gross value of agricultural production in Queensland ($13 billion). Agricultural land in the Sunshine Coast region occupies 1,100 square kilometres, or 36 per cent of the region. Areas classified as conservation and natural environments (nature conservation, protected areas and minimal use) occupy 880 square kilometres, or 29 per cent of the region. The most common land use by area is grazing native vegetation, which occupies 530 square kilometres or 17 per cent of the Sunshine Coast region. The Sunshine Coast region has a diverse agricultural sector. The most important commodities in the region based on the gross value of agricultural production were poultry ($66 million), followed by strawberries ($35 million) and milk ($29 million). These commodities together contributed 60 per cent of the total value of agricultural production in the region. Demographics At the last census in 2016, the population of the Sunshine Coast was 346,522. The median age was 44 years old, 6 years older than the nationwide median. The male-to-female ratio was 48.3-to-51.7. Most residents were born in Australia (73.7%), with 1.9% being Indigenous Australians. The most common countries of birth of other residents were England (6.2%), New Zealand (4.5%), South Africa (1.0%), Germany (0.7%), and Scotland (0.6%). The most commonly spoken languages other than English were German (0.6%), and French, Italian, Afrikaans, and Dutch (0.3% each). A large proportion of Sunshine Coast residents reported no religious affiliation (34.0%). Of those who had a religious affiliation, the most frequent were: Catholic (18.2%), Anglican (16.8%), and Uniting Church (5.2%). Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data from the May 2019 Labour Force Survey indicate that around 184,200 people were employed in the Sunshine Coast region. Health care and social assistance was the largest employment sector with 26,800 people, followed by construction with 26,500 people, and education and training with 21,200 people. Other important employment sectors in the region were accommodation and food services; retail trade; and professional, scientific and technical services. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector employed 2,600 people, representing 1 per cent of the region's workforce.

Cumulative songs are popular for group singing, in part because they require relatively little memorization of lyrics, and because remembering the previous verse to concatenate it to form the current verse can become a kind of game.  Structure  Typically, the lyrics take the form of a stanza of at least two lines. In each verse, the text of the first line introduces a new item, and the other line uses the words to begin a list which includes items from all the preceding verses. The item is typically a new phrase (simultaneously a group of words and a musical phrase) to a line in a previous stanza. The two lines are often separated by refrains. Many cumulative songs also have a chorus.  Example with two-line stanza  One of the most well-known examples of a cumulative song is the Christmas song \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\", which uses a two-line stanza, where the second line is cumulative, as follows: > On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent (or \\"gave\\") to me A > partridge in a pear tree. On the second day of Christmas my true love sent > to me Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree. On the third day of > Christmas, my true love sent to me Three french hens, two turtle doves and a > partridge in a pear tree. and so on until > On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me Twelve drummers > drumming, eleven pipers piping, ten lords a-leaping, nine ladies dancing, > eight maids a-milking, seven swans a-swimming, six geese a-laying, five > gold(en) rings, four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves and > a partridge in a pear tree. The first gift (the partridge) is always sung to a \\"coda melody\\" phrase. For the first four verses, the additional gifts are all sung to a repeated standard melodic phrase. In the fifth verse, a different melody, with a change of tempo, is introduced for the five gold(en) rings; and from this point on the first five gifts are always sung to a set of varied melodic phrases (with the partridge retaining its original coda phrase). Thence forward, the wording of each new gift is sung to the original standard melodic phrase before returning to the five gold(en) rings.  Example with refrains  In many songs, an item is introduced in the first line of each stanza and extends the list in another line. An example is The Barley Mow (Roud 944): > Here's good luck to the pint pot, Good luck to the barley mow Jolly good > luck to the pint pot, Good luck to the barley mow Oh the pint pot, half a > pint, gill pot, half a gill, quarter gill, nipperkin, and a round bowl > Here's good luck, good luck, good luck to the barley mow The second verse substitutes a larger drink measure in the first line. In the second line the new measure heads the list and is sung to the same musical phrase as pint pot. > Here's good luck to the quart pot, Good luck to the barley mow Jolly good > luck to the quart pot, Good luck to the barley mow Oh the quart pot, pint > pot, half a pint, gill pot, half a gill, quarter gill, nipperkin, and a > round bowl Here's good luck, good luck, good luck to the barley mow One version of the final line and refrain is: > Oh the company, the brewer, the drayer, the slavey, the daughter, the > landlady, the landlord, the barrel, the half-barrel, the gallon, the half- > gallon, the quart pot, pint pot, half a pint, gill pot, half a gill, quarter > gill, nipperkin, and a round bowl Here's good luck, good luck, good luck to > the barley mow Alan Lomax recorded Jack French singing The Barley Mow at the Blaxhall Ship, a famous singing pub in Suffolk, in 1953.

Originally named Laguna Grande by Spanish explorers, it was renamed for the town of Elsinore, established on its northeastern shore on April 9, 1888. Limnology Lake Elsinore is the largest natural freshwater lake in Southern California. With its own 750-mi2 (1,900-km2) watershed, it is situated at the lowest point within the San Jacinto River watershed of , at the terminus of the San Jacinto River. It is the terminal lake of a partially closed basin called the San Jacinto Basin. Lake levels are healthy at an average of above sea level with a volume of http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/board_info/agendas/2002/july/0718-12.doc STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD that often fluctuates, although much has been done recently to prevent the lake from drying up, flooding, or becoming stagnant. At , the lake will spill into the outflow channel on its northeastern shore, known properly as Temescal Wash, flowing northwest through Temescal Canyon and feeding Alberhill Creek, which joins Temescal Creek, which in turn dumps into the Santa Ana River just northwest of Corona. =Lake history= Lake Elsinore was seen by the Spanish Franciscan padre Juan Santiago, exploring eastward from the Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1797. In 1810, the water level of the Laguna Grande was first described by a traveler as being little more than a swamp about a mile long.Water-supply paper, Volumes 425‚Äì429 By Geological Survey (U.S.), History of Elsinore Lake, p. 255 Later in the early 19th century, the lake grew larger, providing Mexican rancheros, American trappers, the expedition of John C. Fr√©mont, and the immigrants during the California Gold Rush a spot to camp and water their animals as they traveled along the southern shore of the lake on what later became the Southern Emigrant Trail and the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail. The lake and the Laguna Rancho adobe built near the lake on its southwest shore at its western corner was described by Benjamin Ignatius Hayes, who stayed there overnight on January 27‚Äì28, 1850: > In about 15 miles reach some timber where the hills approach near, > apparently the termination of the valley of Temecula, a sort of low divide > over which we enter into another valley. In both these is much good soil, > although in the latter more of the wiry grass and more marshy, some little > evergreen oak among the hills. Come to the Laguna, two miles from the > divide. Some good young grass, great deal of elder on its banks; as we rode > along frequent flocks of geese rose from the shore; many shots at them; none > brought down. The water of the Laguna is saltish, the animals cannot drink > it; if they could, such a sheet of fresh water here would be invaluable to > the owner of this land.

As a result of the Great Flood of 1862, the level of the lake was very high, and the Union Army created a post at the lake to graze and water their horses. In the great 1862‚Äì65 drought, most of the cattle in Southern California died and the lake level fell, especially during 1866 and 1867, when practically no rain fell. However, the lake was full again in 1872, when it overflowed down its outlet through Temescal Canyon.Water-supply paper, Volumes 425‚Äì429 By Geological Survey (U.S.), History of Elsinore Lake, p. 255] After 1872, the lake again evaporated to a very low level, but the great rains in the winter of 1883‚Äì84 filled it to overflowing in three weeks. Descriptions of the lake at this time say that large willow trees surrounding the former low-water shore line stood or more below the high-water level and were of such size that they must have been 30 or more years old. This indicated the high water of the 1860s and 1870s must have been of a very short duration.Water-supply paper, Volumes 425‚Äì429 By Geological Survey (U.S.), History of Elsinore Lake, p. 255 The rainfall until 1893 was greater than normal, and the lake remained high and overflowed naturally on three or four occasions during that time. The lake water was purchased by the Temescal Water Company for the irrigation of land in Corona, California. Its outlet channel was deepened, permitting gravity flow down the natural channel of Temescal Canyon to Corona for a year or more after the water level sank below the natural elevation of its outlet. As the lake surface continued to recede, a pumping plant was installed, and pumping was continued a few seasons, but the concentration of salts in the lake, due to the evaporation and lack of rainfall, soon made the water unfit for irrigation, and the project was abandoned by the company. After 1893, the lake's water level sank almost continuously for nearly 10 years, with a slight rise every winter. Heavier precipitation, beginning in 1903, gradually filled the lake to about half the depth above its minimum level since 1883. Then in January, 1916, a flood rapidly raised the level to overflowing. The lake hosted teams for Olympic training and high-speed boat racing in the 1920s. The lake went dry in the mid-1930s, but refilled by 1938. The lake ran dry during most of the 1950s and was refilled in the early 1960s. More than a week of heavy rains in 1980 flooded the lake, destroying surrounding homes and businesses. Since then a multimillion-dollar project has been put into place to maintain the water at a consistent level, allowing for homes to be built close to the lake. In 2007, an aeration system was added to prevent fish kills in the lake's ecosystem.  Description  Lake Elsinore sits in a basin, the Elsinore Valley, a graben rift valley and part of the Elsinore Trough. It is the largest sag pond in the Elsinore Fault Zone.http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m262bk.htm Ecological Subregions of California, Subsection M262Bk, Perris Valley and Hills It lies beyond the northwestern extremity of the Temecula Valley, cut off from its Santa Margarita River watershed by a slight ridge running across the valley south of the lake between the Sedco Hills and the Elsinore Mountains to the west, part of the larger Santa Ana Mountain Range to the west and northwest of the valley. On the west side of the lake are many small arroyos, such as the Lakeland Village Channel, which drains canyons whose source is on the east slope of the Elsinore Mountains. Lake Elsinore's northwestern shore rises to the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains and the saddle between them and the Clevelin Hills, which closely enclose the lake along its northeastern shore until they decline and end short near the shore of the Temescal Creek outlet from the lake that passes through downtown Lake Elsinore. Two of its larger tributaries come into the north shore of the lake from the Santa Ana Mountains, Leach Canyon Creek, and McVicker Canyon Creek. The lake south of the Temescal Creek outlet lies in an open area at the mouth of its major tributary, the San Jacinto River, distantly bounded to the east by the Tuscany Hills and south of the river by the Sedco Hills both part of the range of the Temescal Mountains. Much of lake basin has been cut off from the lake and river by a flood-control levee, which only permits the isolated section to fill after an extremely large rainfall event raises the lake over the level of the overflow spillway, north of the baseball stadium. =Discharge= Lake Elsinore Valley, and the San Jacinto Basin that is its tributary, is a partially closed drainage basin, part of the Great Basin Divide. Its watershed is normally endorheic, but sometimes flows into the Santa Ana River watershed during periods of high water following heavy rainfall or snow melt. It discharges water through the Elsinore Spillway Channel outlet to Temescal Creek when the lake reaches the level of that outlet at 1,255 ft (383 m). Temescal Creek, flows through Warm Springs Valley and Walker Canyon into the Temescal Wash, which in turn flows through the northern Elsinore Trough to the Santa Ana River in such conditions. In recent years, efforts to maintain the lake at a stable high level have made these flows occur more frequently and for a longer duration during the year.

Young children are naturally curious about their surroundings and will always explore, but as they may be unaware of dangerous substances or situations, the results can be fatal. Numerous cases of poisoning have resulted from eating brightly colored pills or spilling cleaning solvents. Containers In the United States, child safety locking mechanisms have been required by law since 1970 on all containers for potentially dangerous medicines and household cleaning products. These laws are enforced by the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These locking mechanisms may take several forms, but the most common is a design that requires a tab to be pressed firmly as the lid is twisted. Great strength and dexterity are not required to open the bottle, but the process is deliberately made to be unintuitive, and the children who might recklessly eat pills are unable to decipher the opening instructions. Parents and guardians are firmly admonished to keep all such containers out of the reach of children anyway, as no locking device is foolproof. It has become common practice in households to keep medicines and pills in high cabinets (sometimes locked) for safety. Cleaning agents, however, are still generally kept under sinks, where they are accessible. Cabinet doors Another type of lock is an inexpensive device which can be easily installed into drawers, cabinets, or other openables to prevent easy opening. It consists of a bendable plastic rod with a blunt hook on one side, and is situated on the inside of the drawer or cabinet. The hook catches on part of the drawer or door and prevents opening unless the rod is bent downward simultaneously to disengage the hook. These devices are helpful to pet owners as well ‚Äî a typical housecat may be able to paw open a cabinet filled with food, but would have trouble operating the hook mechanism. Also available are electromagnetic cabinet locking devices that are activated via remote control. Certain locks are available specifically for child proofing. These locks have the same function as the other lock design: to lock away valuables, food, or dangers from unwanted guests. However, these locks have a design that resembles a strap like lock. It attaches with two adhesive stickers and opens with a small slider. This slider was specifically designed to be tough for smaller children to get open, such as the medicine/cleaning product containers. Because of its latch design, it is not only able to strap to cabinets, but also other objects of the like. This includes but is not limited to fridges, toilets, garbage cans, drawers, microwaves, etc...

While referred to as child safety locks, this device prevents operation of the interior door handle for any passenger using the engaged door's interior handle, preventing exit unless the rear window can be lowered and the exterior handle engaged, or the passenger relocates to the front driver's seat. The lock is typically engaged via a small switch on the edge of the door that is only accessible when the door is open. Some cars implement the child lock control as a rotary mechanism which can only be operated with a key. This design ensures the child lock remains in position, preventing passengers from changing the lock position when the door is open. Once the door is closed, control of these two mechanical type child locks is completely inaccessible to passengers. Starting in 1999, manufacturers began using electronic child locks activated from the driver position via a Door control unit, although Nissan offered manual, remote controlled child locks on their Pulsar/Cherry as early as 1982. According to 49 CFR 571.206 S4.3.1, when the safety lock is engaged, it \\"prevents operation of the interior door handle or other interior latch release control and requires separate actions to unlock the door and operate the interior door handle or other interior latch release control,\\" effectively locking passengers inside the vehicle. Pool Fencing Child safety locks can be fitted to pool fencing in order to make a pool area safer. In Australia, pool fencing is required by law. It is stipulated that the lock should be attached on the side of the fence facing toward the pool, so that anyone entering would have to reach over the top of the boundary. Failing this, the child safety lock should be at least off the ground.

Biography  Engraved portrait of Henri I de Montmorency As Gouverneur, Damville came as the head of an army into Toulouse for nine months in 1570 and was chastized by the capitouls for letting Catholic property fall into the hands of a passing Protestant army without taking action. They accused him of being betraying the city and being in league with Protestants like his cousin Admiral Coligny. Damville responded by arresting four bourgeois and sending them to Paris with charges of slander. Damville also placed a procureur-g√©n√©ral on the Parlement of Toulouse who was suspected of Protestantism. When Damville went into revolt in October 1574 (aligning with the Protestants of lower Languedoc) he was deprived of his office by the Parlement of Toulouse, and arrests were made of his associates charged with conspiracy against the king. He became Duke of Montmorency on his brother's death in 1579. As a leader of the party called the Politiques he took a prominent part in the French Wars of Religion. In 1593 he was made constable of France, but Henry IV showed some anxiety to keep him away from Languedoc, which he ruled like a sovereign prince. Issue With his first wife, Antoinette de La Marck (1542-1591), daughter of Robert IV de La Marck, he had two daughters: * Charlotte de Montmorency (1571-1636), married in 1591 Charles de Valois, Duke of Angoul√™me and had issue; * Marguerite de Montmorency (1577-1660), married in 1593 her cousin Anne de L√©vis, Duke of Ventadour (died 1622); they were the paternal grandparents of Louis Charles de L√©vis.

Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003, and was the creation of text-MUD veterans J. Todd Coleman, James Nance, Josef Hall, Patrick Blanton and Robert Marsa and a team of 45 programmers, designers and artists. It closed on July 1, 2009. Shadowbane was a top-10 best selling PC game at launch, and had two noteworthy aspects. First, the majority of the game world allowed for open player versus player combat, making it an early pioneer title in the PvP MMO genre. Second, it was the first major MMO to offer dynamic world content as a primary feature of the game. Most MMOs are static, meaning the world itself does not change based on player actions. Dynamic worlds allow player to change the game world itself; morphing terrain, building and destroying buildings and fortifications, and setting up patrol paths for player-hired AI combatants. The game was considered a \\"cult hit\\" and sustained a small base of followers, but technical issues plagued the game at launch and failed to retain much of the early fanbase shortly afterward. After the sale of Wolfpack Studios to Ubisoft in March 2004, the live service was transitioned to a new management and (largely new) development team, led by Frank Lucero and Ala Diaz. This team later splintered off to become Stray Bullet Games in June 2006, and Mark Nuasha was brought in to run the organization. On March 15, 2006 the game was made free-to-play. A system of short ads was introduced on March 6, 2007 to fund operating costs, which are displayed when the game is opened or closed and when a character dies (with at least 10 minutes between death ads). On March 19, 2008, all servers were closed to prepare for the \\"Shadowbane Reboot,\\" a relaunching of the game to capitalize on stability and performance gains hindered by previously existing data. All player characters and cities were deleted in this reboot. On March 25, 2008, the fifth anniversary of the game's launch, two servers were brought online followed by a third due to overpopulation. The game was closed the following July. The regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races. Character creation was fairly extensive, allowing for detailed, differentiable characters to be created. Gameplay Shadowbane was notable for emphasizing player-versus-player combat, implementing non-conventional races and specializing in siege warfare (players building cities and trying to raze enemy players' cities) whereas a significant number of MMORPGs released since Ultima Online usually restrict player killing to certain areas of the game or special dedicated PvP servers. The game also featured a seamless world map, and made no use of instancing. Players were also allowed to own cities and capitals and most of the property and cities in Shadowbane were player owned. In effect, Shadowbane's war status was decided by the players rather than the game company. Whether a guild city went to war with another guild city was entirely up to the leaders. A government system was also implemented in the game. It ensured players were in total control of the Shadowbane world. Though there were no quests in the game, Shadowbane featured PvP, Nation, and Siege Warfare systems, which offered players a wide range of in-game opportunities. There were twelve races available in the game. There were four basic classes; Fighter, Healer, Mage and Rogue. Not all races could use every class. At 10th level, each character had to choose to promote to a specific profession, such as a Ranger or Assassin. Two classes, Fury and Huntress, were for female characters only whilst the Warlock was for male characters only. Which professions were available was dependent on the race, gender and base class of the character. In addition, each character could take up to four disciplines, from a list of over thirty, though as with Professions, access was limited by race, class and current profession. The level hard cap was level 75, and until level 70 the fourth discipline slot was locked. After shifting to free to play system, Ubisoft used an ad-based revenue generation system consisting of short ad videos at game start, game close and character death. Ads played on character death were limited to no more than one instance in ten minutes. Closure On April 17, 2009, it was announced that Shadowbane would shut down its servers on May 1, 2009. Shadowbane fans petitioned against the announced shutdown, and obtained a reprieve when, on April 29, 2009, the planned shutdown was postponed to July 1, 2009. There was no further postponement. On April 13, 2012, Chinese gaming company Changyou announced it had acquired the intellectual property rights and source code to Shadowbane with the intent of developing a new version of the game, which would be titled World of Shadowbane. Announcement of re-opening Around April 20, 2020 Changyou announced that Shadowbane is going to re-launch. Currently the game is in server testing phase, first two-week test server opening on april 29, 2020 and second month-long test server opening on May 20, 2020. Reception The original Shadowbane received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Goals of land use planning may include environmental conservation, restraint of urban sprawl, minimization of transport costs, prevention of land use conflicts, and a reduction in exposure to pollutants. By and large, the uses of land determine the diverse socioeconomic activities that occur in a specific area, the patterns of human behavior they produce, and their impact on the environment. In urban planning, land use planning seeks to order and regulate land use in an efficient and ethical way, thus preventing land use conflicts. Governments use land use planning to manage the development of land within their jurisdictions. In doing so, the governmental unit can plan for the needs of the community while safeguarding natural resources. To this end, it is the systematic assessment of land and water potential, alternatives for land use, and economic and social conditions in order to select and adopt the best land use options.Young, A., 2003 Often one element of a comprehensive plan, a land use plan provides a vision for the future possibilities of development in neighborhoods, districts, cities, or any defined planning area. In the United States, the terms land use planning, regional planning, urban planning, and urban design are often used interchangeably, and will depend on the state, county, and/or project in question. Despite confusing nomenclature, the essential function of land use planning remains the same whatever term is applied. The Canadian Institute of Planners offers a definition that land use planning means the scientific, aesthetic, and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities and services with a view to securing the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of urban and rural communities.Canadian Institute of Planners, 2011 The American Planning Association states that the goal of land use planning is to further the welfare of people and their communities by creating convenient, equitable, healthful, efficient, and attractive environments for present and future generations.American Planning Association, 2011 History Land use planning often leads to land use regulation, which typically encompasses zoning. Zoning regulates the types of activities that can be accommodated on a given piece of land, as well as the amount of space devoted to those activities, and the ways that buildings may be situated and shaped.Barnett, J., 2004 The ambiguous nature of the term ‚Äúplanning‚Äù, as it relates to land use, is historically tied to the practice of zoning. Zoning in the US came about in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to protect the interests of property owners. The practice was found to be constitutionally sound by the Supreme Court decision of Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. in 1926. Soon after, the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act gave authority to the states to regulate land use. Even so, the practice remains controversial today. The ‚Äútaking clause‚Äù of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. The case of Dolan v. City of Tigard demonstrated the criteria that determine the threshold of what is considered taking. One interpretation of the taking clause is that any restriction on the development potential of land through zoning regulation is a ‚Äútaking‚Äù. A deep-rooted anti-zoning sentiment exists in America, that no one has the right to tell another what he can or cannot do with his land. Ironically, although people are often averse to being told how to develop their own land, they tend to expect the government to intervene when a proposed land use is undesirable. Conventional zoning has not typically regarded the manner in which buildings relate to one another or the public spaces around them, but rather has provided a pragmatic system for mapping jurisdictions according to permitted land use. This system, combined with the interstate highway system, widespread availability of mortgage loans, growth in the automobile industry, and the over-all post-World War II economic expansion, destroyed most of the character that gave distinctiveness to American cities. The urban sprawl that most US cities began to experience in the mid-twentieth century was, in part, created by a flat approach to land use regulations. Zoning without planning created unnecessarily exclusive zones. Thoughtless mapping of these zones over large areas was a big part of the recipe for suburban sprawl. It was from the deficiencies of this practice that land use planning developed, to envision the changes that development would cause and mitigate the negative effects of such change. Suburban development near Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States As America grew and sprawl was rampant, the much-loved America of the older towns, cities, or streetcar suburbs essentially became illegal through zoning.Walters, D., 2007 Unparalleled growth and unregulated development changed the look and feel of landscapes and communities. They strained commercial corridors and affected housing prices, causing citizens to fear a decline in the social, economic and environmental attributes that defined their quality of life.Southwestern NC Planning and Economic Development Commission, Community Foundation of WNC, & the Lawrence Group Architects of NC, Inc., 2009 Zoning regulations became politically contentious as developers, legislators, and citizens struggled over altering zoning maps in a way that was acceptable to all parties. Land use planning practices evolved as an attempt to overcome these challenges. It engages citizens and policy-makers to plan for development with more intention, foresight, and community focus than had been previously used.  A broader description and application of land use planning  =Description of land use planning= Land use planning is defined as: the process by which optimum forms of land use and management are indicated, considering the biophysical, technological, social, economic and political conditions of a particular territory. The objective of planning land use is to influence, control or direct changes in the use of land, so that it is dedicated to the most beneficial use, while maintaining the quality of the environment and promoting conservation of the land resources. The territorial diagnosis and the generation of alternatives of management and environmental protection for the planning of the use of the land produces the indispensable knowledge necessary for the formulation of the policies of use, contributing to the search of competitive and sustainable productive and extractive activities and systems. The methodological process of land use planning contributes to: orienting the location of economic and social activities regarding the aptitude of the land and providing solutions to conflicts of use; indicate the base of natural resources that should remain and protected areas; point out the areas exposed to natural hazards and their management; identify sustainable productive and extractive activities and systems; guide the planning of land uses and indicate the areas that require land adaptation or recovery projects =Planning Process and Parties Involved= In most countries, the local municipal council/local government, the body responsible of the Environment and oftentimes the national government assume all the functions of land use planning; among them the corresponding function to territorial ordering (OT). For this reason, the highlighted bodies have among other responsibilities the promotion of the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, establishing policies, criteria, tools and procedures of the most appropriate efficient and sustainable territorial order in coordination with any other relevant corresponding entities such as construction companies and the public. =Application of Land Use Planning= * \\"Developing cities and towns\\": Land use planning is an important component of city planning. The nature of cities required to the most beneficial use in terms of maximization of economic factors and promoting convenience, while maintaining the quality of the environment and promoting conservation of the land. The only way to achieve this is the utilization of the elements of land use planning. *\\"The concept of Zoning\\": Zoning is the process by which areas of land are split into zones by appropriate establishments within which several users are assigned to each zone. Therefore, this makes zoning very important modus operandi in land use planning where it is used to design urban areas in many countries (Lewis-Roger, 1987). The topic of zoning is considered within the context of land use planning and design as a systemic perception. Zoning is used as a fundamental component of territorial planning, which is incorporated in the stages of the logical model of regional development. In the process of zoning, the actor divides land into units of different sizes, shapes and locations, according to the characteristics of the terrain and the corporality of a culture. The actor who generates a multiplicity of spaces using zoning, based on global spatial unit and the preferences of user who uses these spaces in multiple use form, decomposes his vision of it into four different dimensions namely; deontic, cognitive, expressive and aesthetics functions. Each of these dimensions represents land in different forms, intensities, positions and areas, which may not coincide with each other. The deontic space is that of the transforming actions of the world, of the duty to be and to do. The cognitive space is apprehended by the faculties of knowledge from the senses to the reason, such as the ecological and technological spaces. The aesthetic space refers to the scopes of feel and beauty. The expressive or indexical space corresponds to the internal and cultural expression of the identity of the person who organizes the space. Often, a fifth space is included, that is, the administrative space, which concerns the positioning of the legal, authoritative and legislative base being planned. Zoning should not be considered as the end in itself, but only as a means of approximation in relation to geographical reality. Instead of imposing pre- established categories, it is about looking for landscape discontinuities. The category system (taxonomy) must allow a deepening (level) of the landscapes according to their scale. For each order of phenomena there are thresholds of manifestation and ‚Äúextinction‚Äù that by themselves can justify the systematic differentiation of landscapes into hierarchical units. The study and zoning of the coverage and land use requires first defining the concepts of land, coverage and use in order to avoid the problems of interpretation associated with the management of these concepts. The concept of land is defined as an entity formed by the mutual interaction of living and non-living nature in a recognizable portion of the Earth's surface. It is a more geographical than edaphological definition. The earth is conceived as the result of the integration of biophysical and socioeconomic elements whose interrelation generates certain particular spatial units or landscapes, therefore, land and landscape are considered in this guide as synonyms. Land cover, on the other hand, is defined as the different features that cover the land, such as water, forest, other types of vegetation, bare rocks or sand, man-made structures, etc. In general, these are the traits that can be directly observed in aerial photographs and frequently in satellite images. The concept of use, applies to the employment that man gives to different types of coverage, cyclically or permanently to meet his material or spiritual needs. Basically, this is where the need for zoning arises.Lewis, Roger K. (1987) ‚ÄúThe Powers and Pitfalls of Zoning,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrom Zoning to Master Planning and Back.‚Äù In shaping the City. Washington, DC: AIA Press 1987, pp 274 281. . =Conditions Necessary for Land Use Planning= # Community relation: For any land planning activity to be commenced the involved actors must involve the community or the member of the public in order to put into consideration their opinions on the proposed land planning initiatives. After all, the land is being planned so that the public can enjoy the benefits that comes from land use planning. # Government and legal support: the government can support land use planning initiatives in a myriad of ways. The first is by financing or subsidizing a section of land use planning activities. The second way is by reducing bureaucracy and administration bottlenecks that comes with obtaining permits and licenses. Pros and Cons of Land-Use Planning =Pros= * Land use planning is an important growth framework: certainly, prosperous urban areas have a vision that they must follow through a framework to achieve a development in a well- ordered way. Hence, land use planning provides this framework. * A well planned urban area is a well-prepared urban area: Anticipating the future allows for better preparedness. Indeed, the presence of natural phenomenon that represents a threat to human life activities implies a limitation in the use of land. It is necessary then, to plan the use of the land taking into account its limitation in order to allow the containment of natural phenomenon and its manifestations either by restricting the presence of human life and/or activities, adapting infrastructure conditions in a manner that reduces its vulnerability to natural phenomenon or implementing plans conducive to risk mitigation. The absence of territorial planning plans, the lack of definition of areas exposed to threats and the lack of studies on natural phenomena that might bring threats, ensure an increase in the number and magnitude of disasters of natural origin. The process of land use planning developed putting into consideration this aspects, allows the identification, location and evaluation of areas exposed to natural phenomena, hence allowing the implementation of measures that guarantee risk mitigation. * Good land use planning positively impacts the development of urban economy. *Promote the national territorial order and economic ecological zoning as a support for the conservation, use and sustainable use of natural resources and biological diversity, as well as the orderly occupation of the territory. * Incorporate the analysis of natural and anthropic risk in territorial planning processes, as well as adaptation measures to climate change. * Promote mechanisms to prevent the settlement of populations and the development of socio-economic activities in areas with high potential for risks in the face of natural and anthropic hazards. * Promote territorial planning as a basis for concerted development plans and border development, in the management of watersheds and coastal marine areas. * Guides the actions of regional and local governments for the efficient fulfillment of their functions in this area of land use planning. =Cons= * The cost of land use planning is usually high, generally because of Malinvestment and the non-anticipation of Technology. Land use planning and environmental sustainability In view of sustainable development, land use planning is seen as a political and technical- administrative decision-making process agreed with social, economic, political and technical factors, for orderly occupation and sustainable use of the land under development. On the other hand, it seeks regulation and promotion of the location and sustainable development of human settlements, economic and social activities, and spatial physical development, based on the identification of potentialities and limitations that consider environmental, economic, sociocultural, institutional and geopolitical criteria.(Lee & Yeo, 2018; Von Haaren et al., 2016) By and large, these parameters are put in place in order to make sure that the environment is protected during land use or land development. Indeed, based on the recommendations of the United Nations in its Habitat conference, land is assigned a high importance for the development of human life as it is the fundamental support for its permanence and development, this being the most important objective of the policy of human settlements. That is, the land resource is recognized as an essential element, which supports the social, political and economic formation of society. As mentioned earlier, the use of land refers to the occupation of a certain area according to its agrological capacity and therefore its development potential, it is classified according to its location as urban or rural, it represents a fundamental element for the development of the city and its inhabitants since it is from these that its urban structure is formed and therefore its functionality is defined. For this reason, there is a need to ensure sustainability in order to ensure the we continue to enjoy the benefits that come from urban planning and to ensure that future generations will continue enjoying these benefits. To guarantee this, land use planning come into the fold. In a broader sense, this is a tool through which State defines the type of use land will have within a settlement, e.g. a city, while also determining the guidelines for its use in order to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Land use, in this case, is assigned on the basis on its physical and functional characteristics that they have in the urban structure, and with the aim of occupying the space in an orderly manner and according to their physical capacity (occupation of areas suitable for urban development and environmental sustainability), which finally it translates into a harmonious growth of the city. This tool is structured through a planning system at the national and local level, which establishes the general guidelines that should be taken into account for the development of urban development. Here, the authorities involved might formulate a number of restrictions to guarantee sustainability, for example, banning land development in riparian zones or in national parks. Basically, the goal here is to protect the environment. Throughout the world, there are rising levels of environmental degradation due to unclean energy usage in the development and powering of cities and neighborhoods. In the 20th century, there was a global push to develop large cities quickly to accommodate the people who were migrating from rural areas to cities for jobs. The type of energy used for this was either coal or oil fuel, which meant that the environment was disregarded and damaged by numerous urban development projects. Today, the United Nations has found that over half of the world's population lives in cities that are still growing. In order to create environmentally viable urban landscapes, the UN advocated for green energy use, as well as urban development that encouraged green-friendly transportation. In the United States, about 75% of the energy used is allocated to power buildings and modes of transportation; land-use planning can be a useful tool in changing these aspects of energy usage in a way that would be beneficial to both residents and the ecology. A sustainable urban development includes: * Methods for reducing waste, such as recycling and composting programs that are easily accessible to residents. * Limiting pollution, with techniques such as protecting universal access to necessities and encouraging access to facilities, goods, and services in ways that do not require the use of a car. * Encouraging public transportation usage and spread within a city. The Partnership for Sustainable Communities, created by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department Of Transportation, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 was intended to encourage sustainable land-use planning. This partnership helps to ensure that federal housing projects, transportation, and other neighborhood infrastructure would help residents live closer to jobs, while also reducing pollution since there would be less commute time. Over the past decade, this federal partnership has funded 1,066 projects across the 50 States, as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. The total amount of grant money given to these projects has reached approximately $4.6 billion. Some of the programs that the partnership sponsors are the Housing and Urban Development's ‚ÄúSustainable Communities Regional Planning‚Äù and ‚ÄúCommunity Challenge Grant Programs‚Äù. These programs have made important strides in sustainable urban planning, with about 40 percent of U.S. citizens now having access to communities who were awarded these grants. Both of these programs make up $240 million in federal investment towards local land-use planning efforts. Types of planning Various types of planning have emerged over the course of the 20th century. Below are the six main typologies of planning, as defined by David Walters in his book, Designing Communities (2007): * Traditional or comprehensive planning: Common in the US after World War II, characterized by politically neutral experts with a rational view of the new urban development. Focused on producing clear statements about the form and content of new development. * Systems planning: 1950s‚Äì1970s, resulting from the failure of comprehensive planning to deal with the unforeseen growth of post World War II America. More analytical view of the planning area as a set of complex processes, less interested in a physical plan. * Democratic planning: 1960s. Result of societal loosening of class and race barriers. Gave more citizens a voice in planning for future of community. * Advocacy and equity planning: 1960s & 70s. Strands of democratic planning that sought specifically to address social issues of inequality and injustice in community planning. * Strategic planning: 1960s-present. Recognizes small-scale objectives and pragmatic real- world constraints. * Environmental planning: 1960s-present. Developed as many of the ecological and social implications of global development were first widely understood. * Tenure responsive planning: 2015-onwards. It recognizes that land use planning should be collaborative but with the purpose of tenure security improvement. This is a hybrid approach whereby traditional, advocacy, democratic and bottom-up efforts are merged in such a way that they focus towards tenure security outcomes.Chigbu et al. (2017). Combining land use planning and tenure security: a tenure responsive land use planning approach for developing countries. Journal of Environmental Planning and Management, https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2016.1245655 Today, successful planning involves a balanced mix of analysis of the existing conditions and constraints; extensive public engagement; practical planning and design; and financially and politically feasible strategies for implementation. Current processes include a combination of strategic and environmental planning. It is becoming more widely understood that any sector of land has a certain capacity for supporting human, animal, and vegetative life in harmony, and that upsetting this balance has dire consequences on the environment. Planners and citizens often take on an advocacy role during the planning process in an attempt to influence public policy. Due to a host of political and economic factors, governments are slow to adopt land use policies that are congruent with scientific data supporting more environmentally sensitive regulations. Since the 1990s, the activist/environmentalist approach to planning has grown into the Smart Growth movement, characterized by the focus on more sustainable and less environmentally damaging forms of development. Moreover, there is changes on the requirements of land use planning overtime. For example, whilst most of the urban planners suggest the distance from the landfill that a housing estate should be built, they must also take wind direction into consideration Li, Rita Yi Man and Li, Herru Ching Yu (2018). Have Housing Prices Gone with the Smelly Wind? Big Data Analysis on Landfill in Hong Kong. Sustainability, 10(2), 341; doi:10.3390/su10020341 Aerial view of Rosslyn- Ballston corridor in Arlington, Virginia. High density, mixed use development is concentrated within ¬º‚Äì¬Ω mile from the Rosslyn, Court House and Clarendon Washington Metro stations (shown in red), with limited density outside that area. This photograph is taken from the United States Environmental Protection Agency website describing Arlington's award for overall excellence in smart growth in 2002 ‚Äî the first ever granted by the agency.Smart growth supports the integration of mixed land uses into communities as a critical component of achieving better places to live. Putting uses in close proximity to one another has benefits for transportation alternatives to driving, security, community cohesiveness, local economies, and general quality of life issues. Smart growth strives to provide a means for communities to alter the planning context which currently renders mixed land uses illegal in most of the country.Smart Growth Network, 2011 Methods Professional planners work in the public sector for governmental and non-profit agencies, and in the private sector for businesses related to land, community, and economic development. Through research, design, and analysis of data, a planner's work is to create a plan for some aspect of a community. This process typically involves gathering public input to develop the vision and goals for the community. A charrette is a facilitated planning workshop often used by professional planners to gather information from their clients and the public about the project at hand. Charettes involve a diverse set of stakeholders in the planning process, to ensure that the final plan comprehensively addresses the study area. Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, is a very useful and important tool in land use planning. It uses aerial photography to show land parcels, topography, street names, and other pertinent information. GIS systems contain layers of graphic information and their relational databases that may be projected into maps that allow the user to view a composite of a specific area, adding an array of graphically oriented decision making tools to the planning process. A transect, as used in planning, is a hierarchical scale of environmental zones that define a land area by its character, ranging from rural, preserved land to urban centers. As a planning methodology, the transect is used as a tool for managing growth and sustainability by planning land use around the physical character of the land. This allows a community to plan for growth while preserving the natural and historical nature of their environment. Natural ecology and historical identity of the city are matched to its topography in the Urban Landscape System approach that intends to mitigate effects of climate change and improve city branding through the ontology of place. Basis of land use planning authority in the United States  Police power is the basis for land use planning authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and cities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case Commonwealth v. Alger was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.Understanding the Law of Zoning and Land Use Controls, Barlow Burke, Lexisnexis, Chapter 1, Published 2002  Practical Examples of Land Use Planning  = Land Use Planning in Milan city = Milan city is located in northern Italy. It is the second most populous city in the country after Rome with a population of over 4 million (The CBD and its metropolitan Boroughs). Every area in Milan is a segment that starts from the center and reaches the city limits, so that central areas and peripheral areas are part of the same area. In Milan, zones are not identified by names but numbers. The city hall area 1 of Milan includes the entire historical center, starting from the geographical center of Milan in Piazza Duomo up to the Cerchia dei Bastioni. The town hall area 2 goes from Piazza della Repubblica to Crescenzago, Turro, Greco and Precotto. The town hall 3 goes from Porta Venezia to Lambrate, passing through Citt√† Studi. Milan, Italy. The town hall area 4 goes from Porta Vittoria to the Forlanini park, also including Porta Romana, Corvetto and Santa Giulia. The town hall 5 goes from Porta Ticinese to the Agricultural Park, passing through Chiesa Rossa and Gratosoglio. The town hall 6 goes from the Darsena, up to Barona, Lorenteggio and Giambellino. The city hall area 7 goes from Porta Magenta to Baggio and Figino passing through San Siro. The town hall zone 8 goes from Porta Volta to Quarto Oggiaro, passing through QT8 and Gallaratese. And lastly, the town hall area 9 goes from Porta Nuova to Niguarda and Bovisa. The idea here, is to allow members of the nine zones to get easy access to the CBD. Effective measures have been put in place to limit the impact of human activities on the many water bodies in this city such as restricting land development in riparian areas. In fact, the drive for the establishment of the city on the land where it stands was easy accessibility to water. = The Future of Land Use Planning = Due to the increasing discussions in the issues of climate change and global warming, the future of land use planning will be dominated by environmental sustainability themes more than economic convenience.St√ºrck, J., Levers, C., van der Zanden, E.

Most historic counties either merged with other counties, or became regional municipalities or single-tier municipalities. Although counties had existed prior to 1849, after 1849 they replaced the district systems in administering local government and courts in Ontario. The county system is used in southern, southwestern and eastern sections of the province of Ontario. There are no counties in Northern Ontario due to sparse population and a long-standing boundary dispute with the Northwest Territories (that was not resolved until 1912). Counties *Addington County (1792‚Äì1864) merged with Lennox County to form Lennox and Addington County *Brant County (established 1852) split into the single-tier 'county' of Brant and the city of Brantford *Carleton County (1800‚Äì1969) became the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, now the City of Ottawa, a single-tier municipality. *Dufferin County (established 1881) created from parts of Simcoe, Grey and Waterloo counties. *Durham County (1792‚Äì1973) portions merged with Ontario County to form Durham Regional Municipality. Remaining portions joined Northumberland, Peterborough and Victoria Counties. *Grenville County (1792‚Äì1850) merged with Leeds County to form Leeds and Grenville United Counties *Kent County (1792‚Äì1998) became the single-tier Municipality of Chatham-Kent *Haldimand County (1800‚Äì1974; 2001‚Äìpresent) was merged into the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk for many years, but this was divided again with some minor adjustments to the old lines in 2001; it is now a single-tier municipality, not an official county *Halton County (1816‚Äì1973) became Halton Regional Municipality *Leeds County (1792‚Äì1850) merged with Grenville County to form Leeds and Grenville United Counties *Lennox County (1792‚Äì1864) merged with Addington County to form Lennox and Addington County *Lincoln County (1792‚Äì1970) merged with Welland County to form Niagara Regional Municipality *Norfolk County (1792‚Äì1974) was merged into the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk for many years, but this was divided again with some minor adjustments to the old lines in 2001; it is now a single-tier municipality, not an official county *Ontario County a short- lived first county with this name existed from 1792 to 1800, and was split with the eastern portion joining Frontenac County and the western portion joining Addington County. The second existed from 1852 to 1973, and merged with portions of Durham County to form Durham Regional Municipality. A small portion became part of Simcoe County. *Peel County (1851‚Äì1973) became Peel Regional Municipality *Prescott County (1800‚Äì1820) merged with Russell County to form Prescott and Russell United Counties *Prince Edward County (established 1792) has retained its name, but is now a single-tier municipality, not an official county *Russell County (1800‚Äì1820) merged with Prescott County to form Prescott and Russell United Counties *Suffolk County (1792‚Äì1800) formed in 1792 with Ontario County, in 1800 it was split into the Counties of Kent, Elgin and Middlesex. During its short existence it was made up of Delaware Township, Westminster Township, most of North Dorchester Township and the rest Indian land. *Victoria County (1821‚Äì2001) became the City of Kawartha Lakes, a single-tier municipality. *Welland County (1851‚Äì1970) merged with Lincoln County to form Niagara Regional Municipality *Waterloo County (1853‚Äì1973) became Waterloo Regional Municipality in 1973 *Wentworth County (1816‚Äì1970) became Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Municipality, now the City of Hamilton, a single-tier municipality. *York County (1792‚Äì1971) saw Metropolitan Toronto (now the City of Toronto) separate from it in 1953, and the remainder became York Regional Municipality in 1971 Various counties throughout Ontario were joined administratively in the 19th century. While many of these still exist today and have become relatively permanent, some have since been dissolved. For example, the former United Counties of Huron and Perth existed for only a few years in the 19th century. The United Counties of Northumberland and Durham, on the other hand, merged eight years after each one was created, and continued for 174 years up until the dissolution of Durham County on January 1, 1974. Special cases Four of Ontario's electoral districts were also erroneously listed as counties of residence in some of Canada's first post-Confederation censuses. These did not exist as counties in the political sense, although they may be referred to as such in some historical and genealogical works because of their appearances in census data: *Bothwell was made up of townships from Kent and Lambton counties. *Cardwell was made up of townships from Simcoe and Peel counties. *Monck was made up of townships from Lincoln, Haldimand, and Welland Counties. *Niagara was made up of townships from Lincoln County. The Regional Municipality of Sudbury can also be considered 'historic', as it later became the City of Greater Sudbury ‚Äî however, its origins are not in county government, but as a part of the still-extant Sudbury District.

It is located north of the state capital, Brisbane, and is part of the Maroochydore urban centre. In the , Mooloolaba had a population of 7,730 people.  Geography  Mooloolaba Esplanade, 2019 Mooloolaba is bounded on the east by the Coral Sea, on the south by the Mooloolah River, on the north by Alexandra Headland and to the west by Buderim. Mooloolaba Harbour (near the mouth of the Mooloolah River, ) is the home of a large fleet of fishing vessels, as well as being the northern base for the pilot vessels that control shipping through Moreton Bay and the Port of Brisbane. Due to its sheltered location in the lee of Point Cartwright, it is an all-weather harbour favoured by recreational sailors. The esplanade facing Mooloolaba beach is a centre for tourist activity, containing the Sea Life marine park (), as well as many souvenir and clothing shops, bookshops, galleries and restaurants. Behind the apartments facing the Mooloolaba Beach () are camping grounds, backpacker hostels and canal villas. It is also a tourism destination, with cruise ships regularly anchoring outside the port. Mooloolaba is serviced by coach from Brisbane, by train and connecting bus via Nambour, Woombye, Landsborough station, and by air from Sunshine Coast Airport.  History  Mooloolaba derives from the Aboriginal word mulu, meaning snapper fish, or mulla meaning Red-bellied Black Snake. Originally known as Mooloolah Heads, the name was changed to Mooloolaba by Thomas O'Connor in 1919 when he subdivided land for sale there. A Methodist Church hall was opened on Saturday 28 January 1933. Mooloolaba Provisional School opened on 2 May 1933. On 24 January 1938 it became Mooloolaba State School. In September 1954 Archbishop Reginald Halse performed a stump-capping ceremony for the new Anglican church at Mooloolaba. St Elizabeth's Anglican Church was dedicated on 2 November 1954 by Archbishop Halse. Its closure on 2 April 2006 was approved by Venerable R N Gowty, Archdeacon of Wide Bay. The congregation had dwindled to 17 people and a property developer offered a sum for the block in First Avenue (approx ) described as \\"safely estimated to be in the millions\\" to combine the church land with other parcels to build a high-rise residential development. The plan was to combine St Elizabeth's with St Peter's Anglican in Maroochydore and have only one Anglican church in the area. In the , Mooloolaba had a population of 7,730 people.  Education  Mooloolaba State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at the corner Meta and Douglas Streets (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 677 students with 45 teachers (39 full-time equivalent) and 20 non-teaching staff (15 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. There are no secondary schools in Moloolaba. The nearest secondary school is Mountain Creek State High School in neighbouring Mountain Creek.  Amenities  The Sunshine Coast Regional Council operates a mobile library service which visits Moondarra Drive. Sports Mooloolaba is also home to the Mooloolaba Triathlon and the Sydney to Mooloolaba Yacht Race. It is also home to various on beach events. In popular culture Mooloolaba featured in the fourth season of The Amazing Race. Evangelist Peter Foxhall and Pastor Bill Furler pioneered an Assemblies of God church at the Mooloolaba Surf Lifesaving Club in the mid-1980s. The town was also the home of the Christian pop/rock band Newsboys, and is the fourth town mentioned in the original Australian version of the song \\"I've Been Everywhere\\". In August and September 2015, the town garnered media attention when a French woman recorded a video claiming to have had a one-night stand with a male resident of Mooloolaba, asking him to come forward. It turned out to have been a promotional advert for the town, masterminded by a British social media expert - the woman was a French university student and actress.

Mesosomes or chondrioids are folded invaginations in the plasma membrane of bacteria that are produced by the chemical fixation techniques used to prepare samples for electron microscopy. Although several functions were proposed for these structures in the 1960s, they were recognized as artifacts by the late 1970s and are no longer considered to be part of the normal structure of bacterial cells. These extensions are in the form of vesicles, tubules, and lamellae. Initial observations These structures are invaginations of the plasma membrane observed in gram-positive bacteria that have been chemically fixed to prepare them for electron microscopy. They were first observed in 1953 by George B. Chapman and James Hillier, who referred to them as \\"peripheral bodies.\\" They were termed \\"mesosomes\\" by Fitz-James in 1960. Initially, it was thought that mesosomes might play a role in several cellular processes, such as cell wall formation during cell division, chromosome replication, or as a site for oxidative phosphorylation. The mesosome was thought to increase the surface area of the cell, aiding the cell in cellular respiration. This is analogous to cristae in the mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells, which are finger-like projections and help eukaryotic cells undergo cellular respiration. Mesosomes were also hypothesized to aid in photosynthesis, cell division, DNA replication, and cell compartmentalisation. Disproof of hypothesis These models were called into question during the late 1970s when data accumulated suggesting that mesosomes are artifacts formed through damage to the membrane during the process of chemical fixation, and do not occur in cells that have not been chemically fixed. By the mid to late 1980s, with advances in cryofixation and freeze substitution methods for electron microscopy, it was generally concluded that mesosomes do not exist in living cells. However, a few researchers continue to argue that the evidence remains inconclusive, and that mesosomes might not be artifacts in all cases.John F. Stolz (1991) \\"Structure of Phototrophic Prokaryotes\\" CRC Press Recently, similar folds in the membrane have been observed in bacteria that have been exposed to some classes of antibiotics, and antibacterial peptides (defensins). The appearance of these mesosome-like structures may be the result of these chemicals damaging the plasma membrane and/or cell wall. The case of the proposal and then disproof of the mesosome hypothesis has been discussed from the viewpoint of the philosophy of science as an example of how a scientific idea can be falsified and the hypothesis then rejected, and analyzed to explore how the scientific community carries out this testing process.

The population of the civil parish was 1,317 at the 2001 census increasing to 1,647 at the 2011 census. The civil parish includes the settlements of Sudbrook and West Willoughby. History Ancaster was a Roman town at the junction of the Roman roads of Ermine Street and King Street. During the Romano-British period, the Romans built a roadside settlement on the site of a Corieltauvi settlement. It was traditionally thought to have been named Causennis, although that is now believed to be Saltersford near Grantham. Ancaster lies on Ermine Street, the major Roman road heading north from London. To the north-west of Ancaster is a Roman marching camp and some 4th-century Roman earthworks are still visible. Excavations have found a cemetery containing more than 250 Roman burials, including 11 stone sarcophagi. In the later years of Roman occupation, a large stone wall with accompanying ditches was erected around the town, possibly for defence against marauding Saxons. The place name Ancaster is first attested in a 12th-century Danelaw charter from the reign of Henry II, and in a legal document of 1196, where it appears as Anecastre.

During her career she collected 16 world records in outdoor sprints as well as 14 world records in indoor events. Her record of 47.60 in the 400 metres, set on 6 October 1985, still stands. Biography Born in Wismar, East Germany, Marita Koch displayed exceptional speed even as a young child and was defeating boys much older than herself in sprint races whilst at school. By the time she had turned 15 years old, she was training under Wolfgang Meier. Meier worked as a Naval Engineer, but also coached athletics part-time. Koch and Meier moved to Rostock where Koch began to study medicine. However, she decided to stop her studies and focus on running instead. Koch was coached by Meier for her entire career, and they later married. She retained her maiden name, and is now known as Marita Koch- Meier. She and her husband have a daughter named Ulrike. Koch has held world records over several distances from 50 m to 400 m. Some of her best performances are as follows: * 100 m 10.83 seconds (+1.7) Berlin (FRG) 8 June 1983 * 200 m 21.71 seconds (+0.7) Karl Marx Stadt (GDR) 10 June 1979 * 400 m 47.60 seconds Bruce Stadium, Canberra (AUS) 6 October 1985 Koch at the 1984 East German Championships in Athletics in Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany Koch ran a 400 m quarterfinal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal (51.87 seconds), but withdrew due to injury. She set her first world record in 1977 in Milan, when she ran a 400 m indoors in 51.8 seconds. The following year, she set her first outdoor record at 400 m in 49.19 seconds. She topped this with another two world records within a month. In 1979 Koch became the first woman to run a 200 m in under 22 seconds. Her time of 21.71 seconds (wind +0.7 m/s) set at Karl Marx Stadt stood as the world record for nine years. She tied her own 200 m world record in 1984 (21.71 seconds +0.3 m/s Potsdam). However, her 200 m world record was equaled twice in 1986 by Heike Drechsler. One of Drechsler's 21.71 second 200 m performances was achieved into a headwind whereas both of Koch's performances of 21.71 had a tailwind. At the Moscow Olympics of 1980 Koch won the gold medal in the 400 m. Three weeks before the 1984 Olympic Games, she equaled her own record, but the East German boycott prevented her from competing in the games. She also won the European Championships at 400 m in 1978, 1982 and 1986. She remained the European record holder for the 200 m until 28 August 2015 when Dafne Schippers won the 200 m final at the 2015 World Championships with a time of 21.63 seconds. As a member of East Germany's relay teams, Koch also set more world records. They set new world records in the 4 √ó 100 m in 1979 and 1983. The same team won silver in the 4 √ó 400 m relay in the 1980 Olympic Games. They also set world records over the same distance in 1980, 1982 and 1984. In October 1986, she was awarded a Star of People's Friendship in gold (second class) for her sporting success. Koch retired from running in 1987 as one of Germany's most successful athletes. She had suffered from an Achilles tendon injury She and Meier own a sports goods store in Rostock. =The 400 m world record run= On 6 October 1985 at the year's World Cup meet, Koch set the current 400 m world record of 47.60 seconds. That time is considered far out of reach of even the best of today's athletes.Unattainable records leave female athletes struggling for acclaim The meet was held at Bruce Stadium in Canberra, Australia, which is at 605 metres altitude.START LIST 400 Metres Women ‚Äì Round 1 , Daegu 2011 (27 August 2011)2012 Olympic Games Statistics ‚Äì Women's 400m, Athletics Weekly The world record 400 m run had been well planned, and her basic speed and speed endurance proven in several training runs in the weeks prior. One week prior to her 400 m world record run, anecdotal reports suggest that Koch had run the 200 m in 21.56 seconds (fully automatic time). This 200 m performance was never verified by the IAAF and remains unofficial. Koch in Berlin, 21 August 1986 In her world record run, Koch, running in lane 2, came out of the blocks at a scorching pace and eliminated the stagger on most of her competitors by the end of the first bend. Her 100 m split time was reported to be 11.3 seconds, while her 200 m split time was reported to be 22.4 seconds. At the halfway point in the race, she had completely destroyed most of a world class field. Her 300 m split was reported to be 34.1 seconds (hand timed), the all- time best performance for this distance. During the final stages of the race, the original video footage only captured Koch and Olga Bryzhina (n√©e Vladykina) of the former USSR, who was trailing behind, but closing the gap. The rest of the field had been left so far behind that they were not captured by the camera as Koch and Vladykina crossed the finishing line. Third place was Lillie Leatherwood, more than two seconds behind Vladykina. Koch had gained too much of an advantage in the early stages of the race, and Vladykina was unable to pull in Koch before the finish line. Vladykina also ran her all- time best performance (48.27 seconds) in that race. In a 400 m race, the only women to have broken the 48-second barrier are Koch and Jarmila Kratochv√≠lov√° (47.99 seconds, Helsinki, 1983). Kratochv√≠lov√° was Koch's main rival over the distance and also a 400 m world record holder in the early 1980s. Each of them repeatedly beat the 400 m world record set by the other. To this day, no other woman has come within a half a second of Koch. Drug use controversy Koch's achievements, along with the performances of many other East German female athletes, have long been under suspicion that they were achieved with the aid of performance-enhancing drugs. These drugs were and remain illegal, but were not detectable at the time. In 1991, German anti-drug activists Brigitte Berendonk and Werner Franke, were able to save several doctoral theses and other documents written by scientists working for the East German drug research programme.

According to the sources, Koch did use the anabolic steroid Oral-Turinabol (4-Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone) from 1981 to 1984 with dosages ranging from 530 to 1460 mg/year.

It is named after Edward C. Heyde, MD, who first noted the association in 1958. It is caused by the induction of Von Willebrand disease type IIA (vWD-2A) by a depletion of Von Willebrand factor (vWF) in blood flowing through the narrowed valvular stenosis.  Pathophysiology  491x491px Von Willebrand factor is synthesized in the walls of the blood vessels and circulates freely in the blood in a folded form. When it encounters damage to the wall of a blood vessel, particularly in situations of high velocity blood flow, it binds to the collagen beneath the damaged endothelium and uncoils into its active form. Platelets are attracted to this activated form of von Willebrand factor and they accumulate and block the damaged area, preventing bleeding (see von Willebrand factor). In people with aortic valve stenosis, the stenotic aortic valve becomes increasingly narrowed resulting in an increase in speed of the blood through the valve in order to maintain cardiac output. This combination of a narrow opening and a higher flow rate results in an increased shear stress on the blood. This higher stress causes von Willebrand factor to unravel in the same way it would on encountering an injury site. As part of the normal homeostasis of the blood, when von Willebrand factor changes conformation into its active state, it is degraded by its natural catabolic enzyme ADAMTS13, rendering it incapable of binding the collagen at an injury site. As the quantity of von Willebrand factor in the blood decreases, the rate of bleeding dramatically increases. The unraveling of high molecular weight von Willebrand factor in conditions of high shear stress is essential in the prevention of bleeding in the vasculature of the gastrointestinal system where small arterioles are common, as platelets cannot bind to damaged blood vessel walls well in such conditions. This is particularly true in the presence of intestinal angiodysplasia, where arteriovenous malformations lead to very high blood flow, and so the loss of von Willebrand factor can lead to much more extensive bleeding from these lesions. When people with aortic stenosis also have gastrointestinal bleeding, it is invariably from angiodysplasia. It has been hypothesized that defects in high molecular weight von Willebrand factor could actually be the cause of the arteriovenus malformations in intestinal angiodysplasia, rather than just making existing angiodysplasic lesions bleed. This hypothesis is complicated by the extremely high rates of intestinal angiodysplasia in older people (who also have the highest rate of aortic stenosis), and thus requires further research for confirmation.  Diagnosis  Heyde's syndrome is now known to be gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasic lesions due to acquired vWD-2A deficiency secondary to aortic stenosis, and the diagnosis is made by confirming the presence of those three things. Gastrointestinal bleeding may present as bloody vomit, dark, tarry stool from metabolized blood, or fresh blood in the stool. In a person presenting with these symptoms, endoscopy, gastroscopy, and/or colonoscopy should be performed to confirm the presence of angiodysplasia. Aortic stenosis can be diagnosed by auscultation for characteristic heart sounds, particularly a crescendo-decrescendo (i.e., 'ejection') murmur, followed by echocardiography to measure aortic valve area (see diagnosis of aortic stenosis). While Heyde's syndrome may exist alone with no other symptoms of aortic stenosis, the person could also present with evidence of heart failure, fainting, or chest pain. Finally, Heyde's syndrome can be confirmed using blood tests for vWD-2A, although traditional blood tests for von Willebrand factor may result in false negatives due to the subtlety of the abnormality. The gold standard for diagnosis is gel electrophoresis; in people with vWD-2A, the large molecular weight von Willebrand factors will be absent from the SDS-agarose electrophoresis plate. Management  The definitive treatment for Heyde's syndrome is surgical replacement of the aortic valve. Recently, it has been proposed that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can also be used for definitive management. Direct surgical treatment of the bleeding (e.g. surgical resection of the bleeding portion of the bowel) is only rarely effective. Medical management of symptoms is possible also, although by necessity temporary, as definitive surgical management is required to bring levels of von Willebrand factor back to normal. In severe bleeding, blood transfusions and IV fluid infusions can be used to maintain blood pressure. In addition, desmopressin (DDAVP) is known to be effective in people with von Willebrand's disease, including people with valvular heart disease. Desmopressin stimulates release of von Willebrand factor from blood vessel endothelial cells by acting on the V2 receptor, which leads to decreased breakdown of Factor VIII. Desmopressin is thus sometimes used directly to treat mild to moderate acquired von Willebrand's disease and is an effective prophylactic agent for the reduction of bleeding during heart valve replacement surgery. Epidemiology The exact prevalence of the syndrome is unknown, because both aortic stenosis and angiodysplasia are common diseases in the elderly. A retrospective chart review of 3.8 million people in Northern Ireland found that the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in people with any diagnosis of aortic stenosis (they did not subgroup people by severity) was just 0.9%. They also found that the reverse correlation‚Äîthe incidence of aortic stenosis in people with gastrointestinal bleeding‚Äîwas 1.5%. However, in 2003 a study of 50 people with aortic stenosis severe enough to warrant immediate valve replacement found GI bleeding in 21% of people, and another study done in the USA looking at angiodysplasia rather than GI bleeding found that the prevalence of aortic stenosis was 31% compared to 14% in the control group. It is a disease mainly found in older adults but a rare case of Heyde's syndrome has been reported in children.  History  The American internist Edward C. Heyde originally described the syndrome in a 1958 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, reporting on ten patients with the association. Edward Heyde, MD Graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1938, served three years in the Army Medical Corps in WWII and joined the Vancouver Clinic, Vancouver, Washington in 1948, practicing medicine there for 31 years. He died on October 13, 2004. In the 45 years following its initial description, no plausible explanations could be found for the association between aortic valve stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Indeed, the association itself was questioned by a number of researchers. Several studies demonstrated a statistically significant association between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, and in 1987 King et al. even noted the successful resolution of bleeding symptoms with aortic valve replacement in 93% of people, compared to just 5% in people where the bleeding was treated surgically. However, the potential causal association between the two conditions remained elusive and controversial. Several hypotheses for the association were proposed, the most prominent being the idea that there is no causal relationship between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, they are both just common conditions in the elderly, and they sometimes overlap. Other hypotheses included hypoxia of the colonic mucosa and bowel ischemia due to low blood flow, both of which were discounted by later research. Another early hypothesis of note was proposed by Greenstein et al. in 1986. They suggested that GI bleeding could be caused by thinning of the wall of the cecum due to abnormal pulse waves in the ileocolic artery (an artery that supplies blood to the cecum) causing dilation of that artery. Specifically, they note that the usual anacrotic and dicrotic notches were absent from the pulse waves of their people with aortic stenosis. There has been no further research investigating this hypothesis, however, as it has been eclipsed by newer research into acquired von Willebrand‚Äôs disease. The important role of depletion of von Willebrand factor in aortic stenosis was first proposed in 1992 by Warkentin et al. They noted a known association between aortic stenosis (in addition to other cardiac diseases) and acquired von Willebrand's disease type IIA, which is corrected by surgical replacement of the aortic valve. They also noted that von Willebrand's disease is known to cause bleeding from angiodysplasia. Based on these facts, they hypothesized that acquired von Willebrand's disease is the true culprit behind gastrointestinal bleeding in aortic stenosis. They also proposed a possible mechanism for the acquired von Willebrand's disease, noting that von Willebrand factor is most active in 'high shear' vessels (meaning small vessels in which blood flows rapidly). They used this fact to hypothesize that this may mean that von Willebrand factor is activated in the narrowed stenotic aortic valve and thus cleared from circulation at a much higher rate than in healthy individuals. This hypothesis received strong support in 2003 by the publication of a report by Vincentelli et al. that demonstrated a strong association between von Willebrand factor defects and the severity of aortic valve stenosis. They also showed these defects resolved within hours following aortic valve replacement surgery and remained resolved in most people, although in some people the von Willebrand factor defects had returned at six months. Following this observation the shear stress dependent depletion of von Willebrand factor was confirmed, and the protease responsible, ADAMTS13, was identified.

The term mainly describes vans that have been fitted out, often with a coachbuilt body for use as accommodation.  Ambiguity with motorhome  Two Class C campervans, a Freightliner Sprinter (left) and Ford E-Series (right) chassis. Volkswagen Autosleeper Clubman GL, a typical European campervan The term motorhome is sometimes used interchangeably with campervan, but the former can also be a larger vehicle than a campervan and intended to be more comfortable, whilst the latter is more concerned with ease of movement and lower cost. For example, some campervans lack built-in toilets and showers, or a divide between the living compartment and the cab. The United States term \\"recreational vehicle\\" (RV) is more analogous to motorhome than campervan.  Features  Campervans may be equipped either with a \\"pop-up\\" roof which is raised during camping or a fixed roof, either shared with the commercial van that forms the basis of the vehicle (commonly a \\"high-top\\" model), or as part of a custom coachbuilt body. Campervans usually have a small kitchen with a refrigerator (which is often powerable by a choice of gas, battery, or mains electricity) and a two-burner gas hob and grill. They generally have dual- voltage lighting which can work from either a dedicated battery (other than the van battery) known as a deep-cycle or leisure battery, or from AC power, supplied at a campsite via a hook-up cable. Larger models may include a water heater, space heating and air conditioning, a portable toilet and even an internal shower. Smaller models often carry a \\"porta-potty\\" portable toilet, and sometimes an external shower which operates within the privacy of an awning. The term \\"Dormobile\\" is sometimes used generically in the United Kingdom thanks to a once highly popular conversion brand, and \\"Kombi\\" is used in Australia and other countries. The popularity of this type expanded in the 1950s after Volkswagen commissioned the Westfalia company to use the Kombi version of their Type 2 transporter as the basis for a campervan.  Off-road variations  Often called a 4WD camper or 4x4 camper, these vehicles are perfect for going off the beaten track and exploring unsealed roads. Some models include expandable tents mounted on the roof while others have pop-up roofs for additional sleeping space and storage. Pop-up roof variants share certain design elements with roof tents as sometimes fitted to more robust four wheel drive off-road vehicles intended for expeditions rather than relaxed camping. A compromise between these two worlds is sometimes reached by basing the conversion on an off-road vehicle. Sometimes the conversion is demountable from the back of a pick-up truck body.  Classic Volkswagen and other campervans  right There are several types of campervan all manufactured by Volkswagen but depending on their age they are colloquially referred to as either a splitty (split windscreen) a bay (bay framed windscreen) or a bricky (\\"brick\\" shaped van). Although less popular, Mercedes also manufactured a similar-sized light van and conversions were reasonably common in the 1960s and '70s. Of a similar size and vintage is the British Commer Spacevan conversion. suicide doors - of Citro√´n H-Van Camperthumbright In Europe the Citro√´n H-Van has also been used a base for many campervan conversions, and is popular amongst Dutch and Belgian users in particular. Ex-factory, it had several height and length configurations, and in all versions it had a low floor and high ceiling, a legacy of one of its original uses as a mobile shop. It does not usually need a pop-top to accommodate its users. Modern mid-sized Japanese vans such as the Toyota Hiace are sometimes converted to have the appearance of a classic Volkswagen.  New concept car camper  The car camper is a station wagon converted into a travel home. The rear cargo area is converted into a full double bed area usually with a fabricated aluminium framework. All equipment necessary to set up a well-appointed camp site is stored under the double bed with access through lidded areas under the bed. Unlike a standard station wagon where the camping equipment has to be removed before sleeping or a tent set up, the car camper is self-contained.  British and European size and type classifications  = A-class (AC) = Similar to North American A-class recreational vehicles (sometimes known generically as \\"Winnebagos\\") but generally still smaller in Europe. Fully coachbuilt over a medium-to-large van chassis, from 7.5 tonnes and upwards. Highly appointed, sometimes with electrically operated slide-out (sideways) extensions to the living space, electricity-generating windmills and in very large models (of North American scale) sometimes even fitted with a hydraulically operated garage capable of transporting a small car. Smaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A class vehicles are also popular in Europe, similar in size to Overcab Coachbuilts, but without the base vehicles cab. In its place, a (wider) cab is added, which allows for a drop-down bed to be fitted above. Recognisable by their large curved windscreens. = Overcab (OC) = Typical \\"overcab\\" camper on a relatively large Iveco van base Coachbuilt body, retaining the base van's cab, with a raised Luton van style area over the cab containing a bed. Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling. Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Sometimes including a garage for bikes, and may be large enough to support a mechanism for towing a small city car. Roughly comparable to the North American C-class (CC). Common base vehicles include the Fiat Ducato, Renault Master, and Ford Transit. = Low profile (LP) = Coachbuilt but without a raised bed over the cab. Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling. Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Garages and towing fittings may be carried as with the overcab designs. Typical base vehicles are lighter-duty and/or smaller-engined variants of the same vehicles used for overcab designs. = High top (HT) = Autosleeper Harmony \\"high top\\" Campervan Based on a high-top van, typically of around 2.8 to 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight, without major coachbuilding modifications to the body. Beds typically fixed in place or built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles sometimes fitted. Typical base vehicles are the same as for the coachbuilt designs, above. Oftentimes a Dodge, GMC or Ford van will be professionally converted into a high top. = Rising roof (RR) = Mazda \\"rising roof\\" campervan Often based on a relatively small van, typically 2 to 3 tonnes gross vehicle weight, including the classic Volkswagen Type 2, and with a roof which raises, usually with fabric sides, in a way not unlike a roof tent. Bed typically in the rising roof but also sometimes built by moving seats and tables. A rising roof is also sometimes used to allow for standing room in the vehicle. Shower and toilet cubicles rarely fitted. The Volkswagen Transporter is a common base vehicle, and Ford Transits are also reasonably common. = Fixed roof (FR) = Also known as \\"surf vans\\" (or \\"surf buses\\") and \\"day vans\\". Typically similar in size to the rising roof designs. Beds usually built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles very rarely fitted. The Volkswagen Transporter and Mercedes-Benz Vito are particularly common base vehicles. They have become the successors to the classic Volkswagen Type 2. Slightly smaller vans such as the Fiat Scudo may be used; on occasion, even smaller vans such as the Fiat Dobl√≤ are used to make casual light-duty campers with minimal facilities beyond sleeping space. = Dismountable (DM) = Nissan Navara Dismountable camper A coachbuilt body sits on a (sometimes modified) pick-up load-bed, and generally removable at campsites to allow the vehicle to be used. Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles are common bases. = B-class (BC) = This term is not commonly used except for imported North American models, which may vary greatly in size from semi-low profile coachbuilts to van conversions. Typically, a van chassis is provided without interior or some exterior features as an \\"incomplete vehicle\\" by an automobile manufacturer, and upfitted with RV amenities by a coachbuilder. It is then sold as a completed RV and usually has safety standards certification from the RV Industry Association.  North American van conversions  Ford Econoline van conversion GMC Vandura In North America there are many manufacturers of campervans. A well-selling campervan is produced by Roadtrek of Kitchener, Ontario. Since the 1970s, Japanese vans like the Toyota HiAce and the Datsun Urvan, as well as European models based on the Ford Transit, Fiat Ducato and Bedford vans have become popular as base vehicles for conversions.  Amenities  A modern campervan may contain some or all of the following features: * Propane gas/electric powered refrigerator * Propane gas/electric cooktop and/or grill * Microwave oven * Oven * Propane gas/electric powered water heater * One or more beds, some of which double-up as daytime seating * Electricity supplied by \\"house\\" battery or external hook- up * Built-in or cassette toilet with removable disposal tank ‚Äì a flushing toilet with access usually outside the campervan for easy emptying.

He was born in Meerut, and brought up in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Personal life Bharat Bhushan was born on 14 June 1920 in a Vaishya (Baniya) family at Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. His father, Raibahadur Motilal, was the government pleader of Meerut. His mother died when he was two years old. His elder brother was film producer Ramesh Chandra, who owned the Ideal Studio at Lucknow. The brothers left for Aligarh to stay with their grandfather after their mother's death. He did his studies and earned a graduate degree from Dharam Samaj College, Aligarh. After this he took to acting against his father's wishes. He first went to Calcutta to join cinema and later established himself in Bombay. He married into a prominent family in Meerut, Zamindar Raibahadur Budha Prakash's daughter Sarla. They had two daughters, Anuradha and Aparajitha. Anuradha had polio- associated complications. His other daughter Apararith played the role of Mandodari in the famous TV show Ramanand Sagar's famous serial Ramayan. In an interview, Aparajita had said that after the sudden demise of her husband, she turned to acting. Aparajita has done more than 50 films in her career. Bhushan's wife Sarla died of labour complications after delivering their second child in the early 1960s, soon after the release of film Barsaat Ki Raat. In 1967, he married actress Ratna, his co-star in the same film. Bhushan owned bungalows in Bandra, Bombay and other areas. He was an avid reader and boasted of his collection of books, which he had to sell off like his cars and bungalows in bad times, after he turned co-producer on the ploddings of his brother. Only few of his films were successes and unfortunately, the rest flopped. He died after he escaped his financial crisis, on 27 January 1992.  Professional life  He made his debut with the Kidar Sharma hit Chitralekha (1941).Gulzar, p. 533 However, he struggled for over a decade to make a mark in Hindi movies till Baiju Bawra (1952), which gave him instant stardom and legendary status along with Mohammad Rafi, Meena Kumari and Naushad Ali. Though a very talented actor and a prominent star of the 1950s and 1960s in Hindi language films, he often took on roles of tragic musicians in the movies. Films in which he starred as lead actor include Basant Bahar. Baiju Bawra (1952) \\"He portrays historical and mythological characters the best in Hindi movies,\\" states contemporary actor-producer Chandrashekar. He wrote scripts and stories for Barsat Ki Raat, Nayi Umar Ki Nayi Fasal, Basant Bahar, Dooj Ka Chand, etc. He was the producer of Dooj Ka Chand. His brother R. Chandra made many films such as Bebus, Minar, and Basant Bahar. He was the recipient of the second Filmfare best actor award for the film Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in 1954. Most of the great songs of major singers of that period such as Rafi, Manna Dey, Talat, and Mukesh were pictured on him. He was the first chocolate-faced good-looking star of Hindi films. He was one of the few actors who had a good sense of music, so most music-based movies were made with him in lead roles in the 1950s and 1960s. He acted in Hindi language movies until the 1990s. He is still loved and revered by the Indians for the great movies and great songs that he gave in spite of personal tragedies and stiff competition from his contemporaries. He is considered to be one of the greatest stars and legends of Hindi cinema.

She found particular prominence as a playback singer in Hindi cinema. She also sang many modern Bengali songs, both in the film and non-film genre. Early life Geeta Ghosh Roy Chowdhuri was one of 10 children born to a wealthy Zamindar family in a village named Idilpur, Madaripur Subdivision (presently under Gosairhat Upzilla of Shariatpur District, Bangladesh), formerly under Faridpur district in Bengal, British India. Her family moved to Calcutta and Assam in the early forties, leaving behind their land and properties. In 1942, her parents moved to an apartment in Bombay. Geeta was twelve and continued her schooling at the Bengali High School. Singing career 2016 postcard and stamp featuring Geeta Dutt from the series Legendary Singers of India K. Hanuman Prasad took Geeta under his patronage, trained and groomed her in singing and later launched her into singing for movies. In 1946, she got the first break with an opportunity to sing in the mythological film Bhakta Prahlad for which Prasad was the music director. She was given two lines to sing for two songs. She was sixteen at that time. Personal life During Geeta's recording of songs for the movie Baazi, she met its young up-and- coming director, Guru Dutt. Their romance culminated in marriage on 26 May 1953. Together they had three children: Tarun (1954-1985), Arun (1956-2014) and Nina (b. 1964). She also cut a number Non-film discs, singing to the tune of notable music directors like Sudhin Dasgupta and Anal Chatterjee. In 1957, Guru Dutt launched the film Gauri with Geeta Dutt as its singing star. It was to be India's first movie in cinemascope but the project was shelved after just a few days of the shooting. By then, Guru Dutt had got romantically involved with Waheeda Rehman and Geeta had taken to drinking. The break up of their marriage affected Geeta's singing career. In 1958, S.D. Burman had developed discord with Lata Mangeshkar as a playback singer and he attempted to work with Geeta as the main singer of his compositions rather than the upcoming Asha Bhosle who, he felt, was relatively raw. However, out of her personal problems, Geeta would not practice her art sufficiently and failed to meet Burman's demanding standards. He and O.P. Nayyar then started to work with Asha and helped her blossom as a singer. In 1964, Guru Dutt died from a combination of alcohol and an overdose of sleeping pills. (His death was widely perceived as a suicide following two earlier attempts.'Guru Dutt attempted suicide thrice' Rediff.com 8 October 2004.) Geeta then suffered a serious nervous breakdown and ran into financial problems. She tried to resume her singing career, cutting discs at DurgƒÅ PujƒÅ and giving stage shows. She performed a leading role in a Bengali movie, Badhu Baran (1967), and sang admirably in Anubhav (1971), which was her final performance to the music of Kanu Roy.

In 1924 while playing fullback at Lawrence, Long Island, New York high school, Barbuti set a New York state record, which still stands (2013), scoring eight touchdowns in one game. He attended Syracuse University, where he won the IC4A championship in the 400 m sprint in 1928 in a time of 48.8 seconds. The same year he won the AAU Championship in the 400 m dash in a time of 51.4. He played fullback on the Syracuse football teams of 1926, 1927, and 1928 and was the captain of both the football and athletics teams. His trainer, Peter Poole, very seldom let him run his two preferred distances, the 200 yd and the 400 yd, in the same competition, so Barbuti chose the 400 m and 4 √ó 400 m at the 1928 Summer Olympics and won both, setting a world record in the relay at 3:14.2. Next week he set another world record, at 3:13.4 in the 4√ó440 yd relay in London in a match against Great Britain. During World War II Barbuti served with the US Air Force in the 83rd Bombardment Squadron which was part of the 12th Bombardment Group also known as the Earthquakers. He was awarded the Air Medal and the Bronze Star. While stationed in Gambut, Libya, Barbuti helped to organize the Western Desert Track and Field Championships. The competition was between the 12th Bombardment's track men, members of the RAF, and Australian troops. With Barbuti's talent on the track as a runner and as a coach, the men of the 12th won 1st place in 8 out of 11 events. He retired in the rank of major and became deputy director of the Civil Defense Commission for New York State and director of the New York State Office of Disaster Preparedness. In his spare time he acted as a referee in more than 500 intercollegiate football games. On December 24, 1957, Barbuti appeared as a \\"contestant imposter\\" on the game show To Tell the Truth. This episode is still in existence and was most recently aired by GSN on January 20, 2009. The host was Bud Collyer and the panel consisted of Betsy Palmer, Don Ameche, Kitty Carlisle and Hy Gardner.
