It employs the 7th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Trentino-Alto Adige\\", the 13th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Friuli-Venezia Giulia\\", the 1st Parachute Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\" and the Gruppo di intervento speciale.  History  While history of the 1st Carabinieri Mobile Brigade can be wholly traced back to the 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade, in the latter's various organizational assets, the 2nd Mobile Carabinieri Brigade has its origins in both 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (for what amounts to 7th and 13th Carabinieri Regiments) and in the Paratroopers Brigade Folgore (for what regards the modern-day Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\"). = 11th Mechanized Brigade = Emblem of the 13th Carabinieri Regiment \\"Friuli-Venezia Giulia\\" In 1963, with the 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was established directly under the General Command, in order to cope with the internal territorial defence needs. The establishment of the new Brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary to be in a position to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. Overall, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of about 5,000 men with 80 tracked vehicles, 200 other military vehicles, 130 M47 tanks and a paratroopers battalion. However, the brigade never had responsibility for actual unitary operational command, lacking supports due to a political choice, but exercised the tasks of instruction and preparation for the riot control activities. In the reorganization, Mobile Battalions were renamed simply Battalions and were marked with a sequential number, while remaining administratively dependent on the relevant Legion; the Battalions Groups were renamed Carabinieri Regiments, and were given the conceptual role of a resolution unit in both riot and tactical tasks; According original resolutions, Regiments were to have only disciplinary, training and deployment functions, while general management rested within the relevant Legion. The newly formed Mechanized Brigade exercised its operational and training authority on: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Milan): commanding I, II, III and IV Battalions; * 2nd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome): commanding V, VI, VIII and IX Battalions; * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Naples): commanding X, XI and XII Battalions; * 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome) with 2 Squadrons Groups (Battalion- level units) and 1 Armoured-motorized Squadron; * VII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under IV Army Corps; despite being the newest Battalion, the unit inherited traditions and number of the second battalion of Rome, which was disestablished. * XIII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under V Army Corps. The command structure of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of: * Staff, with personnel management and training bodies; * Services Office, with activation and research tasks; * Army officers of Transmissions and Motorization organizations, with management, technical, inspecting and consulting tasks. Each Carabinieri Battalion was led by a Lieutenant Colonel or a Major and consisted of: 1 Command Company (1 Command Platoon, 1 Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon), 2 Rifle Companies (command platoon, 3 rifle platoons, 1 company weapons platoon each), 1 Mortars Company and 1 Tanks Company (Command Platoon, 3 Tanks Platoons). It was therefore a robust tactical complex. The Carabinieri Battalions had to be used only when the police and the local organization of the Carabinieri they had found insufficient, in order not to deprive the General Command of a valuable combat tool. Within the VII Battalion, based in Laives, the Counter-terrorism Special Company was established in 1960s to counter South Tyrolean terrorism.p. 187 Both VII and XIII Battalions were to be always maintained at their full wartime force. However, the 1963 reorganization did not mark the end of the organizational shifts. In 1964, 1st Carabinieri Helicopter Section was established. Between 1967 and 1968 it was set up the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Training Units (led by a Divisional general), with responsibility on the X Carabinieri Brigade (including schools) and XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade. In 1971 it was established the Inspectorate Schools and Special Carabinieri Units; it controlled the X Brigade (dedicated to training) and XI Brigade. In 1969, Battalions framed within Carabinieri Regiments were reorganized. The new structure consisted of Battalion Command Unit, Command and Services Company (Command and Services Platoon, Scouts Platoon, Transmissions Platoon, Tanks Platoon, Transportations Platoon), 2 Mechanized Rifle Companies (Command and Services Platoon, 3 Rifle Platoons, Mortars Platoons). Between 1973 and 1976, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Mestre) also existed, including IV, VII and XIII Battalions. On 1 September 1977, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and their Battalions were transferred under the direct operational and training authority of the 11th Mechanized Brigade; the 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment was renamed Mounted Carabinieri Regiment. In 1975 the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade changed its name in 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (with Arabic numerals) and in 1976 the formation was renamed 11th Carabinieri Brigade; at the same time, the Brigade Command was tasked to exercise only training and logistical authority. Overall, Carabinieri Battalions were divided into two groups, according to the main type (motorized or mechanized unit) of unit the unit deployed. Even during Years of Lead 7th and 13th Battalions maintained their military capabilities and were transferred under direct Army operational control. In the 1976 Friuli earthquake, the XIII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\", IV Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" and VII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Trentino Alto Adige\\" intervened paying rescue and providing police and utility services. In the 1980 Irpinia earthquake Carabinieri Battalions from Bari, Naples and Rome also intervened.pp. 203‚Äì204 = Paratroopers Brigade Folgore = While both 7th and 13th Regiments origin from the 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade, the history of the Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\" can be traced from the Paratroopers Division Folgore. After the end of the World War II, the Carabinieri did not immediately re-establish a Paratroopers unit; however, in 1951 the Army, on the basis of a specific Carabinieri proposal, formed a Parachute Carabinieri Unit in Viterbo, under the direct authority of the General Command, for riot emergencies. In 1958 the Unit was transferred in Livorno (\\"Vannucci\\" Barracks) and then in Pisa, the same city of the Parachute School, until 1962, when it was moved back in Livorno. On 1 January 1963, within the general Army reorganization, the Paratroopers Brigade Folgore of the Italian Army was formally established; the Parachute Carabinieri Unit was renamed Parachute Carabinieri Company. In the same year the Company was expanded and reorganized as Parachute Carabinieri Battalion \\"Tuscania\\" within the Folgore Brigade; in 1975 the Battalion was renamed I Parachute Carabinieri Battalion \\"Tuscania\\". Elements of the Parachute Carabinieri Battalion \\"Tuscania\\" served in Alto Adige in 1960s against South Tyrolean terrorism.p. 20 The Battalion was officially recognized as the legitimate heir of the 1st Parachute Royal Carabinieri Battalion in 1976, when its War Flag was awarded with the Silver Medal for Military Valour for the North African campaign. In the same year, the Parachutism Section of the Carabinieri Sports Centre was established within the Battalion. In 1978, the Special Intervention Group was established as counter-terrorist unit; the personnel was selected from the ranks of the Battalion. From 1982 to 1984 the 1st Parachute Carabinieri Battalion was part of UNIFIL with the task of provide protection to Sabra, Chatila and Burj el-Barajneh refugee camps. From 1991 to 1994 the Battalion was part of UNITAF and in UNOSOM II missions in Somalia, where it was involved in several combat situations. The current designation of Regiment was awarded on 1 June 1996, and it has been subordinated to the 2nd Brigade Mobile Carabinieri since 15 March 2002, having been moved from Folgore Brigade. Despite the status of an autonomous Armed Force being assigned to the Carabinieri on 5 October 2000, the \\"Tuscania\\" remains closely connected to the Folgore Parachute Brigade, with which it shares the maroon beret. = 2001-present = In 2000 the Carabinieri were separated from the Italian Army and were established as autonomous Armed Force and the Mobile Units Command was elevated from Brigade to Divisional level. On 15 September 2001, all Carabinieri units designed to carry out duties related to military missions abroad were grouped in the 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade. The Brigade was established in order to contribute with organic assets to perform the military and special tasks assigned to the Carabinieri, representing an absolute novelty because of the fact of being able to express assets with both military and police capabilities to be used abroad. The following year, on 15 March 2002, the 1st Parachute Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\" was moved from Folgore Brigade to 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade.  Mission  The 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade is the tactical and operational component of the Carabinieri responsible for: * Organize the participation and conduct of military operations abroad for the maintenance and restoration of peace and international security in order to achieve safe and orderly coexistence in the target areas; * Ensure Carabinieri contribution to the activities promoted by the international community or resulting from international agreements aimed at reconstruction and restoring normal operations of local police forces in the areas of presence of the Italian Armed Forces fulfilling training duties, advice, assistance and observation; the Brigade also operates in cooperation and coordination with the related \\"Centre of Excellence for Stability Police Units\\" (CoESPU). * Provide, when required and within the required limits, the military police functions for the Multinational Formations during the peacekeeping operations. = Riot control = The 7th and 13th Regiments provide riot control in missions abroad, but also at home: their deployments include riot control in sensitive areas and in those areas requiring the prolonged presence of homogenous units: Susa Valley (Piedmont), in immigrants' accommodation centres (Sicily) and in sensitive rallies in Rome.  Military operations abroad  Afghan Police train with Italian Carabineri. Since its establishment in 2001, the 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade provide training and certification, as well as logistical support, to Carabinieri personnel sent abroad. The Brigade provides Military Police in support of Italian contingents and provide MSU (Multinational Specialized Unit) and IPU (Integrated Police Unit) Regiments. Current missions are carried out on behalf of the United Nations, NATO, European Union and on behalf of other international agreements. UN missions * Cyprus: United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP); * Lebanon: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). NATO missions * Afghanistan: NATO Training Mission - Afghanistan (NTM-A); * Kosovo: Kosovo Force (KFOR). EU missions Within the European Union, Carabinieri participate (through the Division) in: * Somalia: European Union Training Mission Somalia (EUTM Somalia); * Kosovo: European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX); * Mali: European Union Capacity Building Mission (EUCAP Sahel); * Mediterranean Area: European Union Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAVFORMED) Other missions: * Israel: Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH 2) and, in Palestine, Italian Training Mission (MIADIT) * Lebanon: Italian Bilateral Military Mission in Lebanon (MIBIL) * Iraq and Kuwait as part of the \\"Inherent Resolve\\"; * Libya: Operation \\"IPPOCRATE\\"; * Djibouti: Italian Training Mission (MIADIT Somalia).

This microbial species is a diazotroph, meaning it fixes nitrogen gas (N2), but it does so without the use of heterocysts. T. thiebautii is able to simultaneously perform oxygenic photosynthesis. T. thiebautii was discovered in 1892 by M.A. Gomont. T. thiebautii are important for nutrient cycling in marine habitats because of their ability to fix N2, a limiting nutrient in ocean ecosystems.  Discovery  In 1830 the cyanobacteria genus Trichodesmium was first found in samples collected in marine waters surrounding Egypt and Syria, and described based on morphological features. In 1892, approximately sixty years following the initial discovery of the genus, Gomont described two new species, T. thiebautii and T. hildebrandtii, based on specific morphological characteristics, particularly trichome shape. T. thiebautii was first cultured in a lab in 1993, from water samples collected in North Carolina coastal waters, using a sterilized oligotrophic seawater solution with an addition of 25 mg liter‚àí1 Tricine buffer and adjusted to a pH of 8.17.  Taxonomy  The highly diverse colonial and cellular morphologies among Trichodesmium species have caused much debate about the phylogeny of the genus. Upon initial discovery by Ehrenberg in 1830, the genus Trichodesmium was placed in the family Oscillatoriaceae. More recently, an examination of several key morphological characteristics including colony formation associated with sheath production, cell differentiation along the trichome, and fatty acid composition led to the placement of Trichodesmium thiebautii into the family Phormidiaceae and order Oscillatoriales. Many species originally placed into the family Phormidiaceae, including Trichodesmium spp., were taxonomically relocated in 2005 by two researchers, J. Kom√°rek and K. Anagnostidis, into the family Microcoleaceae, where they remain today. Analysis of the 16s rRNA from Trichodesmium sp. strain NlBB 1067 indicated that its closest phylogenetic neighbor is Oscillatoria PCC 7515 with 94.9% sequence similarity. This close sequence similarity did not resolve the debate on separation of Trichodesmium into a separate genus from Oscillatoria. However, a genetic analysis of the nitrogenase nifH gene sequences of Trichodesmium spp, including T. thiebautii, revealed a distinct cluster within the cyanobacteria clade with very deep branches indicating an early evolutionary radiation. Capone et al. (1997) suggested that the large genetic distance of the nifH gene between Trichodesmium spp. and other species of cyanobacteria, including those in the genus Oscillatoria, may be due to the structural requirements of aerobic N2 fixation.  Characterization  = Physical characteristics = Members of the family Microcoleaceae have a distinct radial arrangement of their thylakoids that distinguishes them from other closely related families of cyanobacteria. Trichodesmium thiebautii is usually composed of a few to hundreds of cells in a colony and has trichomes that appear to be twisted together much like a rope with radiating ends. Researchers examining Trichodesmium spp. in surface waters across the world also observed the rope- like twisted trichomes mentioned by Gomont, under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the original description of T. thiebautii, each cell was said to be twice as long as it was wide. More than 100 years later, researchers were able to cultivate T. thiebautii and saw various colony morphologies ranging from solitary cells to spherical and fusiform (spindle- shaped) aggregates. T. thiebautii‚Äôs most distinct physical cellular structures are a series of gas vesicles found within the cell that allow it to be naturally buoyant and remain at the ocean‚Äôs surface. In lab cultures, T. thiebautii exhibits growth of 0.23 division per day, and individual cells are 4-6 Œºm with trichomes ranging in width from 8 to 10 Œºm. = Metabolism = Trichodesmium thiebautii is a simultaneous diazotroph and autotroph. These bacteria perform daily cycling of their nitrogenase enzyme. New molecules of nitrogenase are synthesized every morning, inactivated in the afternoon, and degraded at night, with a peak in enzyme activity at midday. T. thiebautii is also capable of taking up combined nitrogen (i.e., nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, urea) and will experience a reduction in nitrogenase activities when these other nitrogen sources are available to it. = Ecology = Trichodesmium species are ubiquitous to oligotrophic tropical and subtropical aquatic environments that are known for deep light penetration, clear waters and a stable water column. A key feature to the genus is the presence of gas vesicles, which allow it to stay closer to the surface for photosynthesis. They‚Äôre important ecologically due to their significant contribution of new nitrogen input for the planet‚Äôs oceans. This species is capable of forming large surface blooms that occur when wind stresses are low and Trichodesmium thiebautii is able to accumulate, undisturbed, on the surface of the water. = Genomics = Trichodesmium thiebautii has a genome size of approximately 3.29 Mb with 3370 genes of which 3335 are protein-coding. It has a G-C content of 35.35%.  Importance  Trichodesmium species are known for creating surface blooms in aquatic environments under the right conditions. T. thiebautii and T. erythraeum are often the main cyanobacteria associated with production of the large blooms, though other Trichodesium species can also be found contributing to process. The blooms may cause an increase in inorganic and organic nutrients that can effect light penetration, which influences phytoplankton successions and productivity. Trichodesmium is a genus of non- heterocystous cyanobacteria with a unique metabolism that allows them to that fix N2 while also undergoing oxygenic photosynthesis. It has been estimated that Trichodesmium spp. are responsible for a significant portion, perhaps as much as 25%, of the nitrogen cycling in oceanic ecosystems. The role of T. thiebautii, and other members of its genus, in oceanic nitrogen cycling is significant because nitrogen is an essential element for life. Nitrogen is present in microbial cell structures and used for nucleic acid as well as protein synthesis. In aquatic habitats, nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient in regards to productivity and fixing it from the atmosphere is necessary to allow organisms to utilize it for the biosynthesis of molecules necessary for life.

It contained unconfirmed allegations of a public crucifixion of a three-year-old boy performed by Ukrainian soldiers at the Lenin Square in Sloviansk, told by an alleged resident of Sloviansk, Halyna Pyshnyak (, ), a native of Zakarpattya. Investigative journalists from Russian outlets Novaya Gazeta and Dozhd who visited Sloviansk and interviewed local residents, did not find any supporting evidence to back up the allegations, nor did they find any audio or video footage of the incident, unusual for the time, since actions of the Ukrainian army in the city were well documented at the time. A BBC News report also said that Sloviansk did not have a Lenin Square, where, supposedly locals were assembled to watch the incident. An investigation of Pyshnyak also reported that her husband was a former Berkut unit member who had joined the separatist unit led by Igor Strelkov.

Taxonomy  Halomonas meridiana is a Gram-negative microorganism of the family Halomonadaceae. There are several known strains of this microbe including DSM 5425, ACAM 246, ATCC 49692, and CIP 104043. It shares many characteristics with other species in the same genus. H. meridiana was placed in this genus due to its halophillic nature as well as its close genomic relation to others in the same taxa. This species shares a close relationship with the known species Halomonas elongate, Halomonas halmophila, and Halomonas subglaciescola.  Characteristics/Morphology  Halomonas meridiana is a Gram-negative halophilic organism found in the lakes of Antarctica. It is a rod-shaped cell with rounded ends, and it has peritrichous, all over the surface, flagella. It is between 2 and 3 micrometers in length and 1 micrometer wide. This organism has an average genome currently sized 3.8 mega base pairs (Mbp) containing 56.96% GC's, or guanine and cytosine content. It has 3,864 genes of which 3,696 of those genes are protein coding. H. meridiana is a commensal marine bacteria that is found living on reef-building corals as part of their surface microbiome. It is not known to be pathogenic. Halomonas meridiana is a heterotrophic organism capable of anaerobic growth with the aid of glucose when nitrogen is not present.  Discovery  In 1997, James et al. published a paper describing an organism they had discovered. It was found in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica salt lakes, which contained many undescribed microbes including this organism. Water from the lake was placed on agar plates and incubated. After allowing time for growth, single cells were removed from colonies and grown on new agar places. After 2‚Äì4 weeks of incubation, colonies were transferred to a basal media designed to simulate an organic lake. Many species of microorganisms and several strains of what would later be identified as Halomonas meridiana were found and tested for physical and chemical characteristics using quantitative phylogenetic techniques. James et al. mapped the results of DNA base composition, salt tolerance, and temperature tolerance tests against those of other known organisms of the same family. After careful study, they determined that the organism they had found was different from the rest. They placed the organism in the genus Halomonas. In addition to Antarctica, Halomonas meridiana was also isolated from the host of organisms found living in and on coral, Acropora, across the world. The found organism was identified as Halomonas meridiana using sequences of parts of the 16S rRNA gene. The word Halomonas comes from the Greek word halos meaning \\"salt\\" and monas meaning \\"unit\\" and The word meridiana comes from the word meridian meaning ‚Äúof or belonging to the south\\".  Importance  This species helps expand our knowledge of the importance of heterotrophic bacteria that live in a symbiotic relationship with other organisms. This organism is a symbiont that lives on the surface of coral reefs. Halomonas meridiana was discovered living on the surface of the species Acropora, which are reef building coral. Halomonas meridiana also produces proteases. These metalloproteases specific to marine bacteria are important for cleavage of connective tissues as well as adhesion of detachment to mucus. The alkaline proteases are important aspects of the processes involving detergents, leather, food, and silk for consumer consumption. H. meridiana was an important organism used in defining the new term, haloversatile. H. meridiana exhibits properties of both halotolerant and slightly halophilic bacteria, and as a result a new term, haloversatile, describes the salinity tolerance of this organism better than the traditional terms. Halotolerant and halophilic bacteria, like H. meridiana can also provide valuable information about species that have been adapted to the salt lakes in cold temperatures as well as retaining the ability to live in symbiosis with other organisms.

He was well known for his juvenile fiction and books written for schools. Biography Hayens was born in 1861 and lived most of his life in Glasgow, Scotland. In 1933, he married Jeanie Douglas. He worked at Collins & Co. as chief editor. He edited anthologies and was an author of many books written for boys and young adults. Several of his books focused on themes of war and adventure and was compared in style to George Alfred Henty. One reviewer said that Hayens chose settings in out-of-the-way places. His book, A Vanished Nation is an account of the Paraguayan War; A Captain of the Irregulars chronicled the war between Chile and Peru; and Red, White and Green told a story about the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. However, the reviewer criticised Hayens for paying more attention to the subject matter which detracted from the literary cohesion of his novels. He was once described as, \\"...of Devonshire seafaring stock, and with his blue eyes, flowing moustache and greying hair looked more like an old-time Devonshire sea captain than an editor\\". Works Hayens published both fiction and non-fiction. Almost all his books were targeted towards young boys and teenagers.

National Academy of Sciences, India, Indian Academy of Sciences, and Indian National Science Academy. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 2000.  Biography  Entrance to Aligarh Muslim University Shahid Jameel was born on 8 August 1957 in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to Abdul Majid Siddiqui, a medical academic, and his wife Jameela Aleem. He completed his graduate studies (BSc) at Aligarh Muslim University in 1977 and moved to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur to earn a master's degree (MSc) in 1979. His doctoral studies were under the guidance of B. A. McFadden at the Department of Biochemistry of Washington State University and after securing a PhD in 1984, he did his post-doc work on molecular virology with A. Siddiqui at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology of University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Three years later, he joined the institute as an assistant professor at the division of rheumatology. His stay there lasted a year and on his return to India in 1988, he joined International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) where he established the Virology Research Group. He continued his research at ICGEB as a senior scientist and the head of the virology research group for around 25 years. In 2013, he moved to Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance as its chief executive officer and holds the position. He was short listed as one of the five choices for the post of the vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University in January 2017 and remained in contention when the list was later shortened to three by AMU Court.  Legacy  Jameel's research on virology started with his work on hepatitis B virus during his stay at the laboratory of A. Siddiqui at University of Colorado Health Sciences Center from 1984 to 1987 where he also worked on gene expression of interleukin-1 family of cytokines. Later, he is known to have carried out studies on the molecular biology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and he is credited with identifying molecular characterisation and transmission routes of these viruses. He elucidated the structure of the viruses as well as their functions which are reported to be useful in developing diagnostic and prophylactic protocols. His group identified that HIV-1 subtype C is the most prevalent form of infection in India and he continues his work focusing on HIV accessory proteins, HIV co- receptor dynamics, hepatitis B, X and SARS virus 3a proteins. He headed the group which worked on the development of vaccines for HIV-1 subtype C, a project funded jointly by ICGEB and National Institutes of Health. His research has been documented and cited in texts and articles and he has contributed chapters to books published by others. Besides, he has also published three books, Isocitrate Lyase and Proteinases from Fat-rich Seedlings, Current Developments in Animal Virology: Papers Presented at the First ICGEB-UCI Virology Symposium, New Delhi, February 1995 and Advances in Animal Virology: Papers Presented at the Second ICGEB-UCI Virology Symposium, New Delhi, November 1998 and has mentored a number of doctoral, post-doctoral and master's scholars. Jameel sits in the Court of the Aligarh Muslim University, having nominated to the governing body of the University in August 2016.

An Augustinian priory founded in 1206 was suppressed in 1797. After restoration, the monastic buildings were used between 1917 and 1968 by Benedictine nuns as a house of studies and student residence. History A view of St Gertrude's from Antonius Sanderus, Chorographia Sacra Brabantiae (1659) In 1206 Henry I, Duke of Brabant, founded a priory of Augustinian Canons Regular. In 1252 the priory church was given the dual function of a parish church. John I, Duke of Brabant, extended the priory's possessions in 1298. The priory became an abbey in 1449. Building works were carried out under Theodore Van Brakel (abbot 1465-1486), Jan Van Der Moere (abbot 1486-1514), Philippe de Hosdin (abbot 1553-1569), and Arnould Eynthouts (abbot 1593-1607). The abbey was suppressed in 1797 and the land was divided into three lots and sold at public auction in 1798. In 1911 the property, which had been converted to industrial purposes, was bought by Canon Armand Thi√©ry and extensively renovated, with the aid of Joseph Fran√ßois Piscador, to house a museum of medieval architecture. In 1917 the buildings were acquired by the Benedictine nuns of Paix-Notre-Dame Abbey, Li√®ge, who installed a house of studies and a student residence. The buildings were heavily damaged during the bombing of Leuven on 11‚Äì12 May 1944, leading to fresh renovations in 1945‚Äì1953. The Benedictines left the site after the 1968 linguistic division of the Catholic University of Leuven.

The Inspiration Point Shelter provides mostly unobstructed views of the Palisades across the river and of the George Washington Bridge to the south. History The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation website says that \\"Inspiration Point Shelter opened in 1925 as a resting place for pedestrians and leisure drivers on the Henry Hudson Parkway. Designed by architect Gustave Steinacher in 1924, the neoclassical sitting area opened a year later and quickly became a favorite of Hudson River tourists.\\" The sitting area originally consisted of two levels, the upper, open air covered structure, and a lower level containing restrooms for pedestrians and motorists. The lower level was accessible via stairs on either side of the shelter. After the Henry Hudson Parkway was built in the 1930s, the area around the shelter changed from a place for pleasure drives to a through-way, and the structure was cut off from the rest of Manhattan and fell into disuse. In 1989, Christopher Gray featured the shelter in his book Changing New York: The Architectural Scene. The pull-off from the Henry Hudson Parkway was barricaded and the shelter is now only accessible from the Henry Hudson Greenway which may be entered from the footbridge at 181st Street or the underpass at Riverside Drive and Dyckman Street. The retaining walls along the Greenway adjacent to Inspiration Point show signs of deterioration and vandalism.

The dock itself was built in 1848. The stadium is proposed to be opened in time for the start of the 2023/24 season. Bramley-Moore Dock is within the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City World Heritage Site. The dock is also in the planned Liverpool Waters. The dock has Grade II listed buildings such as the hydraulic tower, dock retaining walls & gate towers. Bramley Moore is an active commercial dock with one original transit shed from 1848 still in use. Planning Everton's search for a new home has been well-documented, including in recent years to the King's Dock and to Kirkby, the current path was first aired by Mayor Joe Anderson on 16 May 2016 following failed dialogue between the club and the Council over another potential site at nearby Walton Hall Park, suggesting Everton could have a new ground \\"within three years\\". Two locations suggested were for a riverside site at Clarence Dock and a site at 'Stonebridge Cross' on the East Lancashire Road 3 miles north east of Goodison Park. On 4 January 2017, the club made it known that their favoured site was Bramley-Moore Dock (ahead of Stonebridge Cross), whilst Mayor Anderson said the council would invest ¬£20m in a new road near the planned ground, alongside plans for a railway station. Everton brought in New York-based MEIS Architects to be involved with the project. In November 2017 the club agreed a 200-year lease with Peel Holdings for the dock site. In January 2018 Everton shared their stadium \\"Key Principles\\". Despite a close-season of change at the club which included the man chiefly involved in the stadium project, Robert Elstone, moving on to pastures new leaving his role as CEO, little was heard from the club for over a year. In October 2018 the Club announced plans for a two-stage public consultation into the proposed move. The first stage would launch in November 2018 with the second to follow in Summer 2019. It also confirmed its intention to submit a planning application for the project in late 2019. In March 2019, the plans were backed by Conservative peer and former deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, who described the stadium relocation as a \\"golden opportunity\\" for the city of Liverpool. In early July 2019, a report revealed that the proposed stadium would be worth nearly ¬£800 million to the local area of north Liverpool. https://peoples-project.co.uk/how-evertons-new-stadium- can-change-and-save-lives-in-north-liverpool/ On 25 July 2019, the club unveiled its final designs for the stadium, under the heading 'The People's Project'. https://peoples-project.co.uk/ Funding On 23 March 2017 it was announced that a deal had been agreed between Liverpool City Council, Everton F.C. and Peel Holdings to acquire the dock for a new football stadium. On 31 March 2017, Liverpool City Council voted in favour of creating a Special Purpose Vehicle company. The company was proposed with securing the funds for the stadium. The lenders would acquire a 200-year head-lease of the land from Peel, the landowners, and leasing the stadium to the SPV, which would in turn sub-lease to Everton for 40 years. The current funding model now proposed before Liverpool City Council (revealed at Everton's AGM on 9 January 2018) would be an arrangement that will see the council borrow ¬£280m at ultra-low interest rates from the government, and then pass that loan on to the club at a profit to the city of around ¬£7m a year over 25 years. Costs for the new stadium now escalating to an estimated ¬£500m, would mean the club would still require to find the remaining ¬£220m. As of June 2018 the council funding still not in place doubts were raised by Mayor Anderson if this funding model would be agreed. In March 2019, while attending the MIPIM property convention in Cannes, Everton‚Äôs chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale said the Club was ‚Äúthe most confident it has ever been‚Äù on securing funding for its new stadium. In January 2019, deputy chairman Keith Harris said funding would not be triggered until planning permission had been granted. In July 2019, it was reported that the Club had options to fund the development from both the private and public sectors, which could include selling naming rights to a sponsor. In January 2020, it was announced that Everton have agreed a naming right deal worth ¬£30 million with Alisher Usmanov who already sponsors Everton's training ground, Finch Farm, strengthening his tie with the club.  Public consultation  On 24 October 2018 Everton announced details of the start of the public consultation for the new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock and the legacy of Goodison Parkhttp://www.evertonfc.com/news/2018/10/24/press- release under the name \\"The People's Project\\". Consultation would begin on 15 November and last for three weeks. In addition a new website was launched to provide information and updates in the project.https://www.peoples- project.co.uk/ In February 2019, Everton announced that more than 20,000 people had taken part in its first stage public consultation, \\"confirming overwhelming community support\\". In October 2019, the Club announced that 43,000 people had responded to its second stage of consultation, believed to be one of the largest responses to a commercial public consultation in Liverpool‚Äôs history. It also announced that it remained on track to submit a planning application by the end of 2019. In November 2019, the results of the second stage consultation were announced, with 96 per cent of respondents supporting the plans and 98 per cent in favour of the design of the 52,000-capacity Bramley-Moore Dock stadium. The consultation has been praised by academic and marketers. Head of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, Chris Daly said, ‚ÄúStrong brands put their customer at the heart of everything they do, and Everton's stadium consultation is a shining example of this.‚Äù The campaign was also nominated for the Northern Marketing Awards, winning ‚ÄòBest Property & Construction Campaign in November 2019. Following the success of the consultation the Club said it would submit its planning application ‚Äúwith confidence‚Äù.  Proposed features  The proposed stadium is planned to be located behind this hydraulic tower at Bramley-Moore Dock. The tower will be kept as a feature. The stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 seats, however the club have said that this could be increased to 62,000 seats in the future. The initial capacity will make it the seventh-largest Premier League stadium by capacity. A key feature is the ‚Äúhome end‚Äù, a single-tier stand that will have a capacity of 13,000. The Stadium architects described its brick and steel construction as appearing to have ‚Äúrisen from the dock\\" in tribute to the city's maritime past, with \\"a subtle nod\\" to the steel lattice trusses designed by Goodison Park's architect Archibald Leitch. The designs include a range of measures to preserve the heritage of the dock. As part of the proposed development a water channel would be maintained to the west of the stadium to ensure the visual continuity of the dock system, which is a key feature of the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site. The proposals include restoring the dock‚Äôs historic Hydraulic Tower to create a unique visitor attraction. A number of other historic features would be preserved including, restoring and relaying the tracks of the old rail lines and restoring original features such as old gratings, paving and cobble stones, bollards, mooring posts, capstones and granite steps.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the second of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the last was on February 11 and the next was on August 7 in the Northern Hemisphere It was the last four of solar saros 115, the next was on July 21, 1906 and the last was on August 12, 1942. Description The eclipse took place in much of the south of the Indian Ocean and included the smaller islands of Kergueren, New Amsterdam and a very small portion of two parts of Northern Antarctica by the ocean at the area of the 75th meridian east as other parts of Antarctica had a 24-hour night. The rim of the eclipse was near Prince Edward Islands, it was north of the Tropic of Capricorn and was about 40‚Äì50 miles (60‚Äì80 km) southwest of the southwesternmost portion of Western Australia. The greatest eclipse was less than a mile (or a kilometer) inland from the Atlantic in Antarctica south of the Antarctic Circle at 67.6 S and 78.8 E at 6:30 UTC (11:30 AM local time). The eclipse started at sunrise off the coast of Africa and ended at sunset off the coasts of Australia. It showed up to below 50% obscuration of the sun. The center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 1,400 km above the area (67.6 S) south of the Antarctic Circle.

It is the site of Universal Pictures and is owned by Comcast through its wholly owned subsidiary NBCUniversal. The lot officially opened the gates of Universal City on March 15, 1915. Today the Universal Studios Lot is made up of 400 acres, which includes more than 30 sound stages and 165 separate structures.  Background  On March 15, 1915, Carl Laemmle opened Universal City Studios on a 230-acre ranch in the San Fernando Valley and called it \\"Universal City\\". The site later became known as Universal Studios Lot and Universal City was considered the first self-contained community dedicated to making films. In 1950, Universal Studios Lot increased its overall size to 400 acres after Universal acquired additional land at the southern border of the studio. Music Corporation of America (MCA Inc.) bought the Universal Studios Lot in 1958. Universal then leased back its property from MCA until MCA and Universal merged in 1962. Over the next decades, numerous television shows and movies were filmed in Universal Studios Lot, notably at the Courthouse Square and Colonial Street sets.. This includes Psycho (Paramount Pictures), Back to the Future (Universal Pictures), The Perfect Storm (Warner Bros.), War of the Worlds (Paramount Pictures/DreamWorks), Desperate Housewives (ABC), and The Good Place (NBC). Today, Universal Studios Lot is one of the largest full- service production facilities. It has continued to modernize and grow with plans to expand by adding additional soundstages and building facilities. Since 2016, the NBC show American Ninja Warrior has filmed their Los Angeles city qualifiers and finals courses on the lot.  Studio Tour  The Studio Tour is a public attraction both as a VIP and at the adjacent Universal Studios Hollywood theme park that offers visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the historic studio lot. The tour first opened in 1915 when Carl Laemmle invited visitors to see the studio in action. The Universal Tour was halted in the late 1920s and revived in 1964. Since then it has evolved through countless iterations, including new tour hosts, movie sets, and experiences.

The hashtag raised awareness about Sexism in Germany after controversial remarks of FDP politician Rainer Br√ºderle.  Progression of the debate  On January 24, 2013 the German Magazine Stern published an article written by Laura Himmelreich about Br√ºderle who was a front runner of the FDP for the Bundestag election in 2013. In this article she claimed that Br√ºderle sexually assaulted her. After the Twitter user Nicole von Horst tweeted about her own experiences of Sexism, a number of women, including feminist Anne Wizorek, established the hashtag #aufschrei. This led to a substantial number of tweets from women describing everyday experiences of unwanted comments and assault, which they considered to be sexist. Between January 24 and January 27, 2013, more than 57,000 tweets containing the hashtag were posted, although not all of them in support of the cause. The sexism debate was consequently re-ignited in both print and digital media, as well as during talk shows hosted by Markus Lanz, Maybrit Illner, and G√ºnther Jauch, and also in international news coverage with Focus describing the issue as \\"having spilled over to the USA\\".

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the only partial eclipse that took place that year. It was part of solar saros 150. Description The eclipse took place in South America including Argentina and Chile (along with its capital Santiago), even Patagonia and its surrounding islands, almost all of Antarctica except for its northernmost fringes along the Indian Ocean just east of the boundary separating the Atlantic and its surrounding oceans, largely the Atlantic and the Pacific. The rim of the eclipse was close to Buenos Aires and its suburban city La Plata and Mendoza. The greatest eclipse was hundreds of miles (kilometers) offshore from Antarctica in the Pacific north of the Antarctic Circle at 64.1 S and 140.9 W at 11:31 UTC (2:30 AM local time). As the moon moved towards the left in Antarctica by the area separating the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, it was seen as it was moved towards the bottom in South America, then right in peninsular Antarctica then top in the area of the 120th meridian east as the axis spun at around the 68th parallel south. The eclipse started at sunrise near Valparaiso and Santiago, Chile and ended at sunset in the Indian Ocean offshore from Antarctica around the third of the way to Western Australia. It showed up to 25-30% obscuration of the sun at South America's southern tip, 30% within the South Pole and 50% at the west of the middle portion of the Peninsula. The center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 1,300 km above the area (67.6 S) south of the Antarctic Circle. The subsolar marking was west of Namaqualand (then also South West Africa, now Namibia).

Established in 1966, Morneau Shepell serves approximately 24,000 clients in North America. Besides North American offices, Morneau Shepell also has offices outside North American, including Brazil, Australia and the United Kingdom. Morneau Shepell is a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: MSI), with market capitalization of $2 billion.  History  In 1966, Frank Morneau founded W. F. Morneau & Associates, an actuarial and benefit consulting firm. The firm expanded to open its first U.S. office in 1987 and it launched its administrative outsourcing practice in 1996. W.F. Morneau & Associates merged with Sobeco in 1997 to establish Morneau Sobeco, led by Bill Morneau as president and chief executive officer.

The company implemented a board diversity policy to maintain a minimum of 30 per cent women and 30 per cent men on its board of directors, it joined the 30% Club and it created a diversity and inclusion council in early 2019. In 2014, Morneau Shepell opened the Morneau Shepell Secondary School for Girls in the Kakuma Refugee Camp, located in northwestern Kenya. In 2016, Morneau Shepell pledged more than $1 million over five years to the school to cover operating costs such as teacher salaries, dorm supplies and security.  Ethics controversy  Bill Morneau, the former finance minister of Canada, resigned from his position as executive chair of Morneau Shepell in October 2015. Since his resignation, Mr. Morneau has been subject to intense scrutiny regarding his holdings in the company, including his use of a blind trust. There have been allegations that Morneau Shepell stands to benefit if the proposed small business taxation legislation is passed. Critics state that Morneau Shepell would benefit if the proposed changes prompt more people to use individual pension plans, a claim which Morneau rejects. In December 2017, Morneau Shepell said that individual pension plans account for less than one 25th of one per cent of its revenues. Mr. Morneau has also been criticized for holding shares in Morneau Shepell outside a blind trust, and thus being in a conflict of interest situation with respect to the pension plan changes. In response, Mr. Morneau said that he acted on the recommendation by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson, who stated that shares could remain behind a conflict-of-interest screen overseen by the minister's chief of staff, and that a blind trust was not necessary. The Conflict of Interest Act states \\"that any such assets, irrespective of their value, must be divested by either the establishment of a blind trust or by way of sale at arm's length.\\" Mr. Morneau responded to the controversy by stating that he sold his remaining shares in Morneau Shepell and donated all of the money he's profited as a result of an increase in the value of share to charity. It was reported that Mr. Morneau and his father sold Morneau Shepell shares before the tax change announcement in December 2015. Media reports state that Mr. Morneau sold 680,000 shares for proceeds of $10.1 million before December 7, 2015. Subsequently, Mr. Morneau is said to have sold an additional 320,000 shares on December 17, 2015, for a profit of $4.5 million, which he donated to charity. It was later reported that Mr. Morneau's father sold 100,000 shares in Morneau Shepell on November 23, 2015 and 100,000 shares in Morneau Shepell on December 3, 2015.  Leadership  In March 2017, Morneau Shepell announced Alan Torrie's retirement from the company and Stephen Liptrap as his successor to the position of president and chief executive officer, effective May 5, 2017.

History  The festival was founded in 2014 by Karin Fornander. It provides \\"visibility for all femtastic filmmakers out there and highlight films with interesting, complex female characters and films which challenge existing gender norms.\\" Festival organizers cite the meager screen time afforded to female lead characters, and note that the time afforded to queer WOC characters is even less. The festival began as a film night, and gradually evolved into a full-blown festival. The festival receives little funding, and maintains the DIY culture of its beginnings, though it began to accept submissions in 2018, and hopes to increase the influence the platform provides in favor of films created by other than cis-white males. BFFW opens every year during the week of International Women's Day, which became an official holiday in Germany in 2018. Attendance has grown every year, and the quality and diversity of film has increased accordingly. The 6th edition of the festival in 2019 featured only queer films with strong female-driven narratives. Every year, the festival announces the Audience Choice award for the best film.  Focus  The mission of the Berlin Feminist Film Week is to provide a platform for female, non-binary, queer, trans and WOC filmmakers who challenge the hegemony of white cis-male filmmakers. The festival seeks to showcase and explore the diversity of female identity, and challenge gender norms, especially in terms of how they are represented in Hollywood and more mainstream independent films.

The filmmakers hoped to cash in on the vanity of politicians, high-society types and prominent businessmen and their families. They would pay a small fee to be in the movie and townspeople would pay to watch their neighbors in the film. It was also common for the local chamber of commerce to pay the production expenses and choose the backdrop and locations for filming. Many times it was promised that the film would be shown around the country, enticing the viewers to come and visit the places they saw. The film would then be returned to the Chamber after its run. They often filmed the same characters in the same story over and over, only changing the cast in each city. Sometimes the title would change leading people to think their particular film was unique. These itinerant films were popular in the silent era, but in some cases they were still operating into the 1970s. Several people made careers out of making itinerant films.  Practitioners  O.W. Lamb, Evening Missourian, April 20, 1917 O.W. Lamb was an early entrant into the field of itinerant filmmaking. His company was Paragon Feature Films and it was very active between 1914 and 1916. He was responsible for The Lumberjack (1914), the first movie to be made in Wisconsin and Present and Past in the Cradle of Dixie (1914) made in Montgomery, Alabama. Lamb also made The Blissveldt Romance (1915) in Grand Rapids, Michigan and The Spirit of Columbus 1865-1915 (1915) in Columbus, Georgia. The Maid of the Miami (1915) was made in Dayton, Ohio. Lamb worked with the Chamber of Commerce who often sponsored the production. One hallmark of Lamb‚Äôs operation would be to offer a reward of a five-dollar gold piece to the person who came up with title for the film.Bellware, Daniel (Spring 2016), \\"Movie Makers Come to Columbus'\\" Muscogiana, Columbus, Georgia: Muscogee Genealogical Society, p. 2. Richard E. Norman of Norman Studios Richard Norman made a film entitled The Wrecker over 40 times in various cities in the Midwest and South between 1915 and 1919. Norman had purchased footage of a train collision that was used as the climax to the story. Unfortunately, no copies exist of this film. He established Norman Studios in Jacksonville, Florida in 1919 and found success making ‚Äúrace films.‚Äù His first was an all-black version of The Wrecker called The Green- eyed Monster (1919). His film The Flying Ace (1926) is the only one of his movies known to have survived. Don O. Newland was active in the 1920s and 1930s. His claims of working with Mack Sennett and Mary Pickford are not backed up by his Internet Movie Database biography. He made many of his films in Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. He used the name of the town followed by ‚ÄúHero‚Äù for the titles to his films. Known titles include Janesville‚Äôs Hero (1926), Belvidere‚Äôs Hero (1926), Tyrone‚Äôs Hero (1934) and Huntingdon‚Äôs Hero (1934). The opening credits are available to watch for Tyrone‚Äôs Hero and the entire film is available for Belvidere‚Äôs Hero. Melton Barker was active later than most. His Kidnapper‚Äôs Foil was filmed dozens of times between the 1930s and 1970s, making him possibly the last of his kind and even attempted to move into television.

Cora Walker was born on June 20, 1922, in Charlotte, NC to William and Benetta Jones Walker. Her parents separated when she was an adolescent, and she, her mother, and her eight siblings dependent on public assistance. When Cora graduated from James Monroe High School, she began to both support her family with two jobs and enrolled in a six-year program at St. John's University in which students earned both a bachelor's and a law degree. She graduated in 1946. As a black woman in the 1940s, she found it difficult to find a work after she was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1947, so she started her own practice in Harlem, where she represented residents in the neighborhood until her retirement in 1999. From 1976 to 1999, she was the senior partner in Walker & Bailey, a black law firm which she established with her son. She ran for the New York State Senate in 1958 and 1964. In the 1950s or 60s, Cora Walker became The Harlem Lawyers Association's first female president. In 1970, the New York Times listed her as one of the most powerful people in Harlem. In 1988, Ms. Walker, then the chair of the National Bar Association Commercial Law Section, founded the Corporate Counsel Conference to connect corporations with the counsel of African-American attorneys.

As introduced, the official title was \\"To amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize a program to prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases.\\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house- bill/4562/titles In early August 2016, the state of Florida was the first state in the U.S. to \\"report cases of localized transmission of the Zika virus.\\" While working overseas before becoming a Member of Congress, Clawson contracted dengue fever from a mosquito bite. Legislative background During a deadlock in Congress over additional funding for the Zika virus, Congressman Clawson introduced the legislation. At the time Clawson introduced the bill, there had been at least 600 virus cases in Florida. In addition to H.R. 4562, in the summer of 2016, Clawson said he would introduce another piece of legislation appropriating $1.1 billion to fight Zika. \\"The explosive spread of this mosquito-borne virus, exacerbated by a lack of vaccines and reliable diagnostic tests, must be curbed utilizing every tool at our disposal in a coordinated international response,\\" Clawson said. \\"The Zika virus is sneaking up on us and we're not paying enough attention. If we deal with it prior to an outbreak we will be much better off.\\" Zika grants At the end of 2016, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) awarded $184 million in funding to states, territories, local jurisdictions and universities to protect people from the spread of the Zika virus. The awards were given as a part of $350 million in funding provided to the CDC under legislation passed by Congress called the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act of 2016. Legislative details This bill would have amended the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grants for state mosquito control programs through FY2020. The bill would authorize $200 million per year for each fiscal year 2016 through 2020 for grants for state mosquito programs. Specifically, the bill amended Subsection (f) of section 317S of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b‚Äì21(f)) as follows:https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4562/text \\"(f) Authorization Of Appropriations.‚ÄîTo carry out this section, there is authorized to be appropriated $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020\\". Legislative history The bill was introduced in the House on February 12, 2016. It was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where it was then referred to the Subcommittee on Health.https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4562/actions The bill had a total of 8 cosponsors. The two original cosponsors (Members of Congress who signed on when the bill was introduced) were Patrick Murphy (D-FL) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL). Other cosponsors (Members who signed on after the bill was introduced) were Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Blake Farenthold (R-TX), Gwen Graham (D-FL), Brad Sherman (D-CA), and David Cicilline (D-RI).https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th- congress/house-bill/4562/cosponsors Subsequent legislation In August 2016, Clawson introduced a separate piece of legislation \\"to fund $1.1 billion worth of Zika prevention programs both domestically and globally.\\" According to Homeland Preparedness News, Clawson warned that the virus outbreak will grow faster in Florida with each passing day the Congress does not act. \\"Now is not the time for partisanship, it is time for governing and doing the right thing for Florida and the nation,\\" he said. \\"America has the most advanced healthcare facilities in the world and must use all resources at its disposal to create a vaccine for this virus. It is time for members to pull all levers in both chambers of Congress to get a funding measure to the president's desk.\\"  See also  * 2015‚Äì16 Zika virus epidemic * Zika virus outbreak timeline References External links * About Zika - U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention * Zika virus fact sheet - World Health Organization Proposed legislation of the 114th United States Congress ","title":"Zika Authorization Plan Act of 2016"},{"id":"53577710","text":"Karl Oskar Staffan Seeberg (Stockholm, August 4, 1938) is a Swedish writer and physician.

The property was previously occupied by the El Rancho Vegas hotel and casino from 1941 until 1960, when it burned down. The land remained vacant until 2001, when Hilton Grand Vacations purchased a portion of the property and began construction of a 28-story timeshare tower. Construction was postponed after the September 11 attacks, as hotels owned by Hilton Hotels Corporation were financially suffering from a lack of tourism as a result of the attacks. Construction resumed in 2002, and the tower opened in February 2004. A second tower, standing 38 stories, began construction later that year and was completed in 2006. History The property began in 1941 as the El Rancho Vegas hotel and casino, located at the southwest corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue, an area that would ultimately become the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. The El Rancho Vegas burned down in 1960. Howard Hughes Corporation owned the property from 1966 to 1995, when William Bennett purchased it. Bennett also owned the Sahara Hotel and Casino across the street. Bennett had the property up for sale in 1999 and 2000, at a price of $2.5 million per acre. In January 2001, Hilton Grand Vacations Company the timeshare subsidiary of Hilton Hotels Corporation purchased of the property for $19.2 million. That month, Hilton announced plans for a 33-story timeshare complex with 1,500 units, to be constructed on the property. Antoine Dagot, chief executive of Hilton Grand Vacations, said the new property would be \\"one of the largest vacation projects in the world.\\" The new project would mark Hilton's third timeshare property in Las Vegas, the other two being smaller ventures located at the Flamingo and the Las Vegas Hilton hotel-casinos. The northern end of the Las Vegas Strip had received little development in recent years, with the latest project being the Stratosphere in 1996. Stephen Bollenbach, the chief executive of Hilton Hotels, said, \\"We can be a leader in revitalizing this part of the Strip. I think this will play a big part in continuing development.\\" Although there was vacant property near the Las Vegas Hilton, Bollenbach said, \\"We think our customers would like to be on the Strip, and we think this is a very good piece of property.\\" Groundbreaking for the new project took place on June 14, 2001, with Penta Building Group as the general contractor. The first phase, with an expected 350 units, was scheduled to open 18 months later, with construction costs at $111 million. The first phase was to be followed by a gradual expansion over the next decade that would bring the number of units up to the planned 1,500 number. On September 24, 2001, Hilton announced that construction had been temporarily stopped due to a decrease in revenues at its hotels in the United States, which was caused by low tourism as a result of the September 11 attacks. Construction on the building had reached the fourth floor at the time of the delay. Hilton planned to re-evaluate the project after six months. In April 2002, Hilton announced that construction had resumed on the project, with completion estimated for January 2004. At that time, the first phase was expected to include 295 units, while the overall property was ultimately expected to have up to 1,523 units. The Hilton Grand Vacations Club held its grand opening on February 4, 2004. The new property featured a desert deco design, and consisted of a 28-story tower with 283 units, built at a cost of $128 million. At the time of its opening, Hilton planned to build three additional towers on the 10-acre property. In May 2004, Hilton announced plans for its $126 million second phase, consisting of a 38-story tower with 431 timeshare units. Construction was to begin in July 2004, with completion scheduled for summer 2006. An ultimate total of 1,577 units was being planned for the property at that time. The second phase began construction in September 2004, with Penta Building Group as general contractor. The second tower was completed in 2006. Both towers were designed by MBH Architects, and contain a combined total of 714 units.

She campaigned for women's suffrage and was one of the first Venezuelan women to openly speak of a woman's right to have children outside of wedlock or obtain an abortion. She advocated for the decriminalization of abortion and the right of both students and teachers to attend school regardless of whether they were pregnant. In the 1960s, she served as a guerrilla fighter for the communist party, later breaking away from the party to help found the Movement to Socialism (MAS). Through this party, she pressed for anti-discrimination regulations to gain socio-economic parity for minorities, workers and women. Early life Argelia Mercedes Laya L√≥pez was born on 10 July 1926 on a cacao plantation in San Jos√© del R√≠o Chico, in the state of Miranda, Venezuela, to Rosario L√≥pez and Pedro Mar√≠a Laya. She was the third of four siblings and was of Afro-Venezuelan heritage. Her upbringing could have been the spark for her later work in seeking equality and rights for all people. Laya‚Äôs parents taught her and her three brothers the importance of equality, to be proud of who they were as Afro- decedents, and to not feel shame or let themselves be discriminated against. Because her father took part in armed movements against the dictator Juan Vicente G√≥mez, he was imprisoned several times and finally banished from Miranda in 1936. He died later that year, leaving the family to face financial hardships. At that time, the family, moved to Caracas where Laya entered the Normal School. While still in school, she founded the Center for Student Novelist and used it as a platform to argue for women's right to education and social and political equality. She formulated her ideas into a national plan establishing principles and strategies to eliminate gender discrimination. She graduated with her teaching degree in 1945 at the age of 19. Careers That same year, a coup d'etat overthrew President Isa√≠as Medina Angarita's regime and Laya was sent to La Guaira to work on a literacy campaign. In 1946, Laya co-founded the National Union of Women Organization () and served as the secretary of the organization through 1958. She called for debates and urged that women be granted suffrage. During her early years of teaching, Laya had a child and as an unmarried mother was suspended from teaching for her immorality. Writing a letter of protest to the Education Minister, Luis Beltr√°n Pietro Figueroa, she put forth her right to be unmarried and have a child and her right not have biases prevent her from seeking services for her child from organizations like child care and health care facilities. After several months, she was allowed to return to teaching, but became more vocal about the ways in which women faced discrimination. Understanding that it wasn't just teachers who were barred from their jobs but that pregnant students were also suspended from school, Laya pressed for reforms so that all citizens universal right to education was recognized. Laya also organized the Women‚Äôs Committee of the Patriotic Board () and served in te Legion of Women Nationalists (). Teaching classes in mental health she advocated for protecting the sexual and reproductive rights of women, advocating for both safe pregnancies and abortions. Laya was one of the earliest Venezuelan women to advocate for abortion rights and decriminalization of the procedure. Laya later became majorly involved in these issues during her time as a board member of the Venezuelan association for alternative sexual education and defense of the violated women. She became Assistant Secretary of the Venezuelan Teachers Federation and an active collaborator with the Board of Directors of the Association of Journalists and Writers in the capital of Vargas. Lara also served as Vice Chancellor at the Victor Camejo Oberto Popular University. In the 1950s, Laya joined the Communist Party of Venezuela (which was quite influenced by the Cuban Revolution and would be used as a model by the Venezuelans) in opposition of the President Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. Two years later, she married and subsequently had three more children. By 1959, in response to the political problems in the country, she had joined the Communist Party's guerrilla groups and operated as Commandant Jacinta. For six years, she participated in guerrilla activities as part of the underground. In the late 1960s, she served as vice president of the First Congress of Venezuelan Women. Advocating for workplace protections including maternity leave and child care centers, the Congress helped to formulate laws to protect the health and employment environments of the working class. Towards the end of her time with the guerrilla group, she became more passionate towards advocating for disadvantaged people‚Äôs (women, minority and working class) rights instead of fighting for military and political power over Venezuela. In the early 1970s, she joined a splinter group of the communist party, which split off and formed the Movement to Socialism (MAS). As one of the founders, Laya was the first woman to occupy such a high position in any political party in Venezuela. But before the ‚Äúsplit off‚Äù, Laya attended a fair hosted by the French communist party (she was still identifying as a communist at that time) in which she was able to travel through Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. In this trip, she discovered that the problem of machismo was not only existent in Latin culture but a world-wide phenomenon. Work pay inequality in these countries, as well as in her own, was a major issue for which Laya would strongly advocate. 1970 was a year of change in her political views as she ended a 20 year long communist affiliation to turn towards socialism. As women's secretary of the new party, she pressed for a code of ethics to be established for the protection of workers, laws to prohibit violence against women, and pushed for regulations to prevent discrimination and injustices toward Afro-Venezuelans and other minorities, peasants, and women. In the 1980s, Laya served on the Women‚Äôs Advisory Commission to the Presidency of the Republic and was an advisor to the Transcultural Institute of Studies of Black Women. In 1982, she took part in the civil code reforms to eliminate discrimination in adoption procedures to protect both mothers and children's rights. In 1985, she was selected to attend the United Nation‚Äôs Third World Conference on Women, held in Nairobi, Kenya as the Venezuelan delegate. During the decade, she also served as Venezuela's representative at the Inter-American Commission of Women and was part of the women's health initiative undertaken by the government. In 1988 Laya unsuccessfully ran as an MAS candidate for governor of the state of Miranda and two years later, became party president. With this accomplishment, she earned the title of the first woman and first of African descent (Afro-Latina/Afro-Venezuelan) to obtain such position. In 1994 she attended the First Meeting to Discuss Women and Education in Bolivia. There, she helped draft a program for eliminating sexism through education. The plan called for gender issues to become integral parts of study and dialogue throughout the entirety of one's education. Death and legacy Laya died on 27 November 1997 in Caracas at the age of 71. Throughout Venezuela, there are programs and policies related to gender equality that bear her name. Some of these programs exist within the Windward Territorial Polytechnic University and the Feminist Formation Plan of the Socialist Training School for Gender Equality. A famous quote of Laya is ‚ÄúLucharemos por nuestros derechos y los de nuestra patria, porque el problema de la igualdad de la mujer es el problema de la liberaci√≥n de los pueblos‚Äù or in English it would be translated to ‚ÄúWe will fight for our rights and those of our country, because the problem of the equality of women is the problem of the liberation of the peoples‚Äù.

The journal focuses a chronological framework that ranges from prehistory to the beginning of the Middle Ages, especially in the Western Mediterranean. The editor-in-chief is Gisela Ripoll.

History The journal was established in 1965 by as a vehicle for disseminating the work of the academic staff and researchers of the Institut d‚ÄôArqueologia i Prehist√≤ria (Institute of Archaeology and Prehistory) of the University of Barcelona. In the first stage, the journal‚Äôs editors were Llu√≠s Pericot and Joan Maluquer while Ana M¬™. Mu√±oz Amilibia acted as its secretary; other professors, such Agustina Fort, Ricardo Mart√≠n, Anna M¬™. Rauret, Carme Solsona, Pere Vegu√© and Miquel Oliva, collaborated in its preparation. The first number, Pyrenae 1 in 1965, contained a series of articles that demonstrated the aims that lay behind the creation of the journal: to give greater projection to the research work of the Institute of Archaeology and Prehistory of the University of Barcelona as the mouthpiece for what was known as the Escola d‚ÄôArqueologia de Barcelona (the Barcelona School of Archaeology). Issue number 1 set the tone for what Pyrenae was to be like in subsequent years with articles by Pere Bosch Gimpera, Joan Maluquer, Pere de Palol, Llu√≠s Pericot, Miquel Tarradell, together with texts by Antoni Arribas, Ana M¬™. Mu√±oz, Anna M¬™. Rauret, M¬™. Llu√Øsa Serra, Carme Solsona, and Gl√≤ria Trias, among others. Pyrenae demonstrated the impact of Catalan archaeology both at the level of the Iberian Peninsula and at an international level. Twelve numbers of Pyrenae were published at regular intervals in octavo format with some 200-250 pages per volume until 1976. From that year onwards, four double volumes were published up to issue 19-20 in 1983-84. This first phase was brought to a close with the publication of volume 21 in 1985, coinciding with the appointment of Professor Maluquer, who had been the driving force behind the journal, as an emeritus professor. Old editions of the magazine Pyrenae In 1993, after a long interruption of eight years, the members of the Department of Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology of the University of Barcelona decided to resume the journal Pyrenae, with the aim of making the research being carried out in our country more widely known. Maria √Ängels Petit assumed responsibility for the journal, as Secretary to the Editorial Board in the first instance and ultimately as Editor, assisted by an Advisory Board made up by all the full professors of the Department at that moment, Josep M. Fullola, Josep M. Gurt, Jos√© Remesal and Merc√® Roca, and by an Editorial Board, the composition of which rotated, but which was initially formed by Francisco Gracia, Fernando Mart√≠n, Jos√© Luis Maya, Rosario Navarro, Josep Padr√≥ and Joan Sanmart√≠. In this second phase, the publication adapted to the times, changing its format from octavo to quarto, while maintaining an average of some 300 pages per volume. The journal was made up by three clearly differentiated parts. The first one comprised articles; a second one, under the heading V√†ria, contained works of lesser breadth and significance, and finally a third section of reviews. During this phase, obituaries of members of the Department‚Äôs academic staff, whether actively employed or retired, who had passed away were also included. This was a period when there was no need to publish in indexed journals outside one‚Äôs usual working environment. For that reason, in the ten issues published during this second phase, the majority of articles were by members of the Department itself or concerned their research fields. It should also be emphasised that Pyrenae acted as a platform for the publication of articles derived from some undergraduate dissertations or parts of important doctoral theses. A total of 10 issues were published up to the double volume for the years 2002-2003, the first being the one corresponding to volumes 22/23 dedicated to a well-deserved homage to Professor Joan Maluquer, which, however, were published some years later, at the end of this period. The year 2003 witnessed a reconsideration of the journal‚Äôs aims, which ultimately gave rise to a new proposal for its publication, while maintaining its title and the idea that it should be the journal of the Department of Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology of the University of Barcelona. This new proposal was presented by Gisela Ripoll together with Rosa M¬™. Albert and Jaume Buxeda. In this way, a new phase of the journal was undertaken. This third phase of Pyrenae, the one beginning in the early 21st century, started with volume 35 corresponding to 2004. Editorial responsibility was assumed by Gisela Ripoll, with the support of Rosa M¬™. Albert, Jaume Buxeda and V√≠ctor Revilla as Assistant Editors. Over the course of the years, various individuals have taken the role of assistant editor in turn; these duties are currently shared by Miguel √Ångel Cau and In√©s Domingo. This team is assisted by the Associate Editors, researchers of international reputation who, in one way or another, are linked with the University of Barcelona and the journal Pyrenae (see Associate Editors, Editorial Board page). In this new phase, Pyrenae aims to establish itself as a point of reference among periodical publications in the scholarly world in the Iberian Peninsula and the Western Mediterranean. As from this moment, Pyrenae took the name Pyrenae, Revista de Prehist√≤ria i Antiguitat de la Mediterr√†nia Occidental / Journal of Western Mediterranean Prehistory and Antiquity. The use of both Catalan and English in the subtitle demonstrates the position of the journal as a publication of reference in this geographical area and for a broad timespan, from Prehistory to the beginning of the Middle Ages. The octavo format was recovered in order to make it easier to consult and read, and the policy of publishing two issues a year established. Since then Pyrenae has applied all the criteria to become a leading journal, which implies carefully selecting among the articles submitted for publication, applying a strict and serious policy of double- blind peer-reviewing, absolute punctuality in its publication, and adapting Pyrenae to the rapid development of new technology. The biannual appearance of the journal facilitates dynamic editorial management, enabling on-going research to be published immediately, which is one of the values promoted by the journal itself. In addition, a journal in two parts makes it possible to publish a first number with an in-depth study as well as four or five articles; the second number can also contain two or three articles, a discussion forum if there is a subject for debate or interest, a substantial section of reviews, and the list of doctoral theses and master's degree dissertations, which make it possible to appreciate the research being carried out in the Section of Prehistory and Archaeology of the University of Barcelona. 2009 witnessed a step of great importance for Pyrenae. The CRAI- Centre deRecursos per a l'Aprenentatge i laInvestigaci√≥ de la Universitat de Barcelona (Resource Centre for Learning and Research of the University of Barcelona) made the effort, thanks to the help provided by the Consorci de Biblioth√®ques Universit√†ries de Catalunya (CBUC) (Consortium of University Libraries of Catalonia), to publish on-line the texts published in the forty volumes of Pyrenae that had appeared prior to that date in open access format and thus make them accessible to all users. Since that moment, the articles published have been uploaded to the collaborative repository Revistes Catalanes amb Acc√©s Obert in PDF format, once the printed Edition has appeared, thereby facilitating access to research and its prompt dissemination. Pyrenae, Revista de Prehist√≤ria i Antiguitat de la Mediterr√†nia Occidental / Journal of Western Mediterranean Prehistory and Antiquity, aims to continue to strive for research excellence, in the same way as its founders did in the mid-20th century, while adapting to the times and the means that science and society place at its disposal. The journal celebrated its 50th year in 2015, with 46 numbers published to date and a special issue Pyrenae. N√∫mero Especial 50√® Anniversari 1965-2015,which reflects the state of the research of all the groups of the University of Barcelona dedicated to Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology. = Exchange History = Since its foundation in 1965, Pyrenae has sought to develop a policy aimed at prioritizing the exchange of publications with scholarly institutions around the world. The objective was to build up the holdings of the new library of the Institute of Archaeology and Prehistory of the University of Barcelona, which were later to pass to the Department of Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology; the transfer of the Faculty of Geography and History to its present premises in the Raval district, in the heart of the historic core of Barcelona, in 2006, led to the Archaeology Library being integrated within the Biblioteca de la Facultat de Geografia i Hist√≤ria (Library of the Faculty of Geography and History).Old editions of Pyrenae The main goal of the publication and of the many exchange agreements was to be able to gain access to newly published works from around the world in the fields of Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology as soon as possible; at the same time, Pyrenae was seen as the most suitable vehicle for making the scholarly studies of the researchers at the Institute of Archaeology and Prehistory, and by extension of the graduates and doctors produced by the University of Barcelona more widely known. The exchange of publications was thus one of the key features of the birth of Pyrenae. Over the course of time, and thanks to Pyrenae, the Library‚Äôs holdings grew exponentially. Unfortunately, the interruption in publication of the journal in 1985, which did not reappear until 1993, was detrimental for the system of exchanges, which had achieved a considerable level of stability. The new phase of Pyrenae that was inaugurated with number 24 in 1993 made it possible to re-establish both national and international exchanges, a policy which has been maintained since that date. This task received the constant attention of Maria del Vilar Vil√† i Bota until her retirement in 2008; since then it has been assumed by Pilar Garc√≠a Arg√ºelles. This policy of publication exchange continues to be of fundamental importance for Pyrenae. = The identity of Pyrenae: the origin of its logo = Picture of decorative motif \\"Vas de les Naus\\" Pyrenae is identified by its logo containing a drawing of a vessel. This was the logo of the Institute of Archaeology and Prehistory of the University of Barcelona; as such it was used for its Occasional Publications and was incorporated by the journal in 1993, when the second phase of its publication was undertaken. The vessel is to be found on the so-called ‚ÄòVas de les Naus‚Äô (ship vase) from the Iberian hill-top settlement of Tur√≥ d‚Äôen Bosc√† (Badalona). It is a double cone-shaped vessel in grey ware from the Catalan coast (COTCAT) (109 cm high and 108 in diameter) with two handles and incised decoration of two vessels on the sea, which is indicated by wavy lines. The piece can be dated to the 3rd century B.C. This ceramic vessel was donated to the Institute of Archaeology of the University of Barcelona. In 1993, the Department of Prehistory, Ancient History and Archaeology of the University of Barcelona loaned the ‚ÄòVas dels Naus‚Äô to the Museu de Badalona (Badalona Museum; Registry number: MB-4581) and finally, in 2009, full ownership was passed to this Museum. This object, which is mentioned in many publications, was published in the first issue of Pyrenae, cf.

It was between troops of the Count of Savoy and the Dauphin of Viennois as part of an ongoing war between the two neighbouring provinces. Background The Counts of Savoy and the Dauphins of Viennois had been almost consistently engaged in disputes and hostilities for some 50 years. When Guigues VIII became Dauphin in 1318 at the age of only 9, Edward, Count of Savoy, took the opportunity to attempt the capture of the castle of Varey with the help of Guichard VI, Sire of Beaujeu, who claimed its ownership. Prelude Edward, supported by Robert of Burgundy, Count of Tonnerre assembled a large force equipped with siege engines, besieged the castle, and proceeded to bombard it. The defenders eventually negotiated a ceasefire, promising to surrender in 10 days time, and meanwhile sent an urgent message to the Dauphin Guigues asking for help. The battle Guigues arrival, supported by Genevans, took the Savoyards by surprise and forced them to prepare hastily for battle, which predominantly took place between the cavalry. A Burgundian charge was repulsed and forced back to the Savoyard camp, where, with the assistance of the Varey garrison, the camp was overwhelmed. Edward and his followers fled to the nearby castle of Pont d'Ain, leaving their camp to be pillaged. Robert of Burgundy and Guichard, Sire of Beaujeu, were taken prisoner, as well as John I, Count of Auxerre, and later ransomed. Aftermath Guigues did not properly exploit his success in the battle and the relationship between the two houses carried on much as before, draining both financially. Hostilities only came to an end after a peace treaty was signed in Paris in 1355.

In 1992, he founded Prophet, a brand and marketing consultancy firm that employs over 400 professionals in the United States, Europe, and Asia; in 1997, Galloway founded Red Envelope, one of the earliest e-commerce sites. In 2005 Galloway founded the digital intelligence firm L2 Inc, which was acquired in March 2017 by Gartner, for $155 million, and the now defunct Firebrand Partners (founded in 2005), an activist hedge fund that has invested over $1 billion in U.S. consumer and media companies. He was elected to the World Economic Forum's \\"Global Leaders of Tomorrow,\\" which recognizes 100 individuals under the age of 40 whose accomplishments have had impact on a global level.

Much of his research focuses on \\"The Four,\\" or \\"the Four Horsemen.\\" His first book, The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, was published in 2017. It analyzes the four companies' peculiar strengths and strategies, their novel economic models, their inherent rapacity, their ambition, and the drastic consequences of their rise that people face in both social and individual terms. In May 2017, Galloway anticipated Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods Market, a transaction that became reality the following month. He denied any insider knowledge and said he was \\"just lucky\\" on that call.

Positions  Since 2017, Galloway repeatedly called for U.S. government antitrust intervention against the four consumer technology companies Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google, ultimately breaking them up. He advocated against Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency plans in July 2019 due to the company's \\"gross negligence of user privacy.\\" In 2019, he endorsed Michael Bloomberg's presidential 2020 candidacy as he \\"fulfills the Democrats' need for a strong centrist candidate.\\" In December 2019, he called for the removal of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey while declaring to own more than 330,000 shares of Twitter stock. Relating to the Apple-FBI dispute, he sided with the U.S. government and said that \\"security agencies should have access to [personal] data wherever it is if a judge deems that data is key to people's safety or national security.\\" Galloway has called for taxing endowments of universities whose enrollment growth is not commensurate with population growth, suggesting exclusivity makes such universities a \\"luxury brand\\" as opposed to a public service.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESwwG9sa2Y Galloway self-describes as an atheist and advises his students not to follow their passion, but to follow their talent.

Biography Ellis assisted her husband in raising the 1st Missouri Cavalry regiment, and went to the field along with them. The regiment went to camp on August 1, 1861, and Ellis began nursing immediately when there was a measles outbreak in camp. Ellis performed numerous roles as a nurse, including assistant to the head surgeon. She recounts in a letter to Mary G. Holland that once Ellis fainted during surgery, but quickly returned to service once she was recovered. At the cavalry charge at Sugar Creek, Ellis worked to transport injured soldiers out of the field and to a house that was serving as a hospital. Ellis even saved the life of a man whom the regiment surgeon overdosed on medication. Though the doctors thought his recovery to be impossible and laughed at Ellis's attempts to revive him, Ellis successfully saved the soldier's life. The regiment surgeon came to resent Ellis after this event, though Ellis was certain that the rest of the unit supported her. In time, Ellis was requested by the chief of the Government Detective Force to act as a detective for the Union Army. During her work as a detective and courier, Ellis wore a quasi-military uniform to protect herself and appear official. Ultimately, Ellis fell ill and was taken to St. Louis to recover. Unfortunately, Ellis did not recover well enough to return to her service as a nurse. As a volunteer, Ellis was never paid for her work.

Financial struggles  In 2009, El/La Para TransLatinas was severely underfunded as they has lost much of their government funding because city of San Francisco instead began allocating El/La's money towards Instituto Familiar de la Raza Inc. They eventually found a way to receive the funding back, but ran into financial problems in 2013. El/La was seeking an additional $80,000 from the city of San Francisco, \\"in order to hire a full-time case manager and expand the work it is doing around the domestic violence that trans Latinas experience.\\" However, later that year they won a grant of $200,000 from the San Francisco Human Rights Commission.  Work and its significance  El/La Para TransLatinas joins Janetta Johnson on stage at the 2016 San Francisco Trans March. Members of El/La Para TransLatinas speak on a stage in the Compton's Transgender Cultural District, at the 2019 San Francisco Trans March. El/La Para TransLatinas continues their HIV and AIDS prevention efforts and have collaborated with organizations like Native American AIDS Project and Mobilization against AIDS. El/La provides transgender Latinas with, \\"support and referrals for immigration, housing, name changes, and other services. Many of El/La's clients speak only Spanish and have sought asylum in the United States because of transphobic violence in their home countries ‚Äì primarily Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean.\\" Many transgender Latinas are afraid to seek the authorities or any government resources because of their legal status and fear of facing more harassment. El/La aims to create a safe space where transgender Latinas \\"feel comfortable talking about any violent experiences and also case management.\\" They also provide anti-violence resources as their 2013 $200,000 grant was awarded to fund their anti-violence efforts. The organization planned on using this grant in order to train \\"luchadoras\\" fight against transphobic crimes and intimate partner violence. In 2015, El/La fundraised money for the funeral of outreach coordination and transgender activist Joana Luna and created an altar in their office space for her. On Friday June 26, 2015, El/La Para TransLatinas worked with the San Francisco Trans March for their 12th annual Trans March. Additionally the organization was featured in a news segment by the popular US-based Latino and Spanish TV channel, Univision on November 19, 2015. This marked a significant step as they were acknowledged as a legitimate organization by the conservative Latino community. A significant feature found within the organization's website is the presence of both English and Spanish in each individual section. This feature was highlighted within the article \\"Trans Latinas: You're not your mother's little boy anymore\\" from a Berkeley journalism article from UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, wherein the issue of a language barrier is brought up.

In addition to winning multiple championships, Mondelli has graduated a number of successful black belts and professional MMA fighters, notably Glover Teixeira. Mondelli oversees the curriculum of his Kore program from its headquarters in Danbury, designed to link the disciplines of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, wrestling and judo in a fluid and practical method of application.  Brazilian jiu-jitsu career Luigi Mondelli began competing in Brazil during his teenage years and progressed through the ranks in a tough and competitive environment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, first winning the Masters Purple Belt Category in 1999 and later the brown belt division, before winning the Panamerican Championship five times. Mondelli is also a three-time world champion as a black belt in the Senior division in both the gi and no-gi categories.  The Pit  Mondelli has been a guest instructor and coach at The Pit (mixed martial arts), a martial arts and MMA camp started by John Hackleman in 1986. The prominent camp has produced several prominent fighters such as Chuck Liddell and Glover Teixeira among others. Mondelli credits John Hackleman as being one of his mentors and a valuable source of knowledge in the course of his development.  Seminars, education and self-defense Additionally, Mondelli provides self-defense and combat training to a broad range of military and law enforcement personnel. Mondelli has performed hundreds of seminars and demonstrations and continues to be active in the education and assistance of safety and self-defense training for veterans, active duty personnel and law enforcement across the United States and around the world.  KORE BJJ and American Top Team Connecticut The Danbury location of American Top Team serves as the headquarters for KORE BJJ and is where Mondelli spends much of his time developing his students. The location offers programs from children ages 4 and up, all the way through competitive and professional world-class Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instruction. It is not uncommon for wrestlers and judoka (judo practitioners) to spend time in the program to round out their skill set, since the KORE curriculum is geared towards proficiency in all types of grappling. Classes are offered every day of the week, with the exception of Sundays, and are almost universally led by a black-belt level instructor, very often including Luigi Mondelli, himself.

They award NIH grants through 24 grant-awarding institutes and centers. The NIH supports $31 billion in research annually, given to more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 institutions for research into a variety of conditions. Each institute of the NIH has separate appropriations from Congress determined on an annual basis. Percentages of grant applications funded vary by institute, from 8% (National Institute of Nursing Research) to 29.6% (National Institute of General Medical Sciences), with an overall average of 18%. Funding percentages have dropped from over 30% in the early 2000s, mainly due to an increase in applications, rather than a decrease in funds available. In 1998, 24,100 applications were received, and 7,500 were funded with a total of $1.9 billion. By 2005, the number of applications had grown to 43,000, of which 9,600 were funded with a total of $3.4 billion. In 2015, 52,000 applications were submitted and 9,500 were funded with $4.3 billion. Grants are assessed based on their significance, innovation, and approach. The major grant awards of the NIH are divided into Research Grants (R series), Career Development Awards (K series), Research Training and Fellowships (T & F series), Program Project/Center Grants (P series), and miscellaneous programs. There are various requirements for grants. Some grants are specified for \\"new investigators\\", which is defined as someone who has not received a prior NIH grant other than a career award or specific small grants (R15, R21, R56, etc.). An \\"early stage investigator\\" is someone who has received their PhD or MD or has finished residency within the past 10 years.  Impact on scientific research  From 2010 to 2016, NIH funded research that led to the development and approval of 210 new drugs. 84 of these were \\"first-in-class\\" drugs, meaning they work through previously unknown mechanisms. About 90% of the research published from the funded grants related to the discovery and characterization of these pathways, rather than the development of the drug itself. A study on the value of public research funding found that 30% of NIH grants led to research being published that was cited in a patent application, and that for every $100 million funded by the NIH, 23 patents were submitted.  Application process  NIH numbers the types of applications: * Type 1 ‚Äì New grant applications * Type 2 ‚Äì Competitive renewal of grants currently funded. Applications are essentially the same as for type 1 applications. * Type 3 ‚Äì Competitive revision of grants currently funded. Investigators can request additional funding for current grants for additional research or unforeseen costs. * Type 4 ‚Äì Extension of grants currently funded * Type 5 ‚Äì Noncompetitive continuation of a current grant. Investigators must submit progress reports to receive continued funding. Applications are reviewed by a Scientific Review Group made up of volunteer subject matter experts, generally professors in the relevant fields, and by a National Advisory Council made up of federal employees. Grants are scored from 1 to 9, with 1 being the highest score. Members of the committees are listed publicly.  Funding process   Funding mechanisms  = R01 = The most common research grant mechanism is the R01. It is the oldest funding mechanism of the NIH. R01s are generally awarded for 3‚Äì5 years, and are used to support a \\"discrete, specified, circumscribed research project\\". R01s can be renewed by competitive application. The application cycle has 3 sets of application dates each year. Standard due dates for new grant applications are February, June, and October 5, and for renewal, resubmission, and revision grant applications are March, July, and November 5. AIDs-related grants have separate due dates. All grant-awarding institutes and centers award R01s. Applications for R01s are complex and are typically over 100 pages by submission. In financial year 2016, the NIH received 26,187 applications for new R01 grants. 17.3% were funded, for a total of $2.2 billion. The average annual budget was $460,000. = Research project grants = Other research grant programs include: * R03, the NIH Small Grant Program, not renewable and limited to 2 years, with a maximum of $50k/year. * R13, NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings * R15, NIH Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA), supports small research projects limited to a total of $300k over up to 3 years, at universities in the US that have not received more than $6 million from the NIH per year. * R21, NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Award, limited to 2 years of funding for a total less than $275k, and does not require preliminary data. * R33, Exploratory/Developmental Grants Phase II, available to R21 awardees * R34, NIH Clinical Trial Planning Grant Program * R35, Outstanding Investigator Award * R37, NIH MERIT award * R56, NIH High Priority, Short-Term Project Award, \\"bridge grant\\", funds applications for R01s that did not receive a qualifying score but are compelling.

It was first published in 1945, and appeared in revised and expanded editions in 1949 and 1956; the third and final edition appeared in 1968. It has been called \\"the first truly insightful English-language Chinese cookbook\\", Much of the text was written by her husband, Yuen Ren Chao, who coined the commonly used English terms for Chinese cooking techniques such as \\"stir fry\\" and \\"pot stickers\\". Pearl S. Buck, at that time the most widely read American author on the subject of China, wrote in her Preface to the book that she wanted to nominate Mrs. Chao for the Nobel Peace Prize: \\"what better road to universal peace is there than to gather around the table where new and delicious dishes are set forth, dishes which, though yet untasted by us, we are destined to enjoy and love?\\" Background During World War II, Mrs. Chao's husband, Yuen Ren Chao, ran the Special Language Training Program at Harvard to teach Chinese to American soldiers. Each night the instructors gathered at the Chao home to prepare the teaching material for the next day, sometimes late into the night. Mrs. Chao developed a repertoire of dishes to feed them that could be prepared in an American kitchen using ingredients from local groceries. Then Agnes Hocking, wife of Harvard professor William Ernest Hocking, and friend of many years, told her to write the book. Her \\"Author's Note\\" explains she was \\"ashamed\\" to have written it, first because as a medical doctor she should have been practicing medicine, second: \\"I didn't write the book\\". She goes on to explain how she, her daughter Rulan and her husband collaborated: :The way I didn‚Äôt was like this. You know I speak little English and write less. So I cooked my dishes in Chinese, my daughter Rulan put my Chinese into English, and my husband, finding the English dull, put much of it back into Chinese again.Hayford (2012) p. 78, quoting from How To Cook and Eat, p. 21 Jason Epstein, who met Mr. and Mrs. Chao when he edited the revised and enlarged edition of the book, remembered that Buwei Yang Chao did not speak or write much English. He wrote \\"it is obvious from the text that the professor wrote the entire book in his wife's name, using her recipes,\\" that is, \\"pretending to be his wife‚Ä¶\\" However, Yuen Ren later told an interviewer that Rulan did the translation: \\"She would complain sometimes, 'Daddy, you have so many footnotes. Somebody will think that you translated the book,' not that she was the translator\\".Chao, Yuen Ren. Interviewed by Levenson, Rosemary. \\"Chinese linguist, phonologist, composer and author: oral history transcript / and related material, 1974-1977,\\" \\"China Scholars Series\\": pp. 177-78 In 1974, Buwei and her daughter Lensey Namioka published How To Order and Eat in Chinese, a guide to eating in Chinese restaurants. Structure and contents The cookbook is organized on the same scheme as Y. R. Chao's Mandarin Primer, the text he prepared for the wartime Army language program.Yuen Ren Chao 1948, Mandarin Primer, an Intensive Course in Spoken Chinese, Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Just as each chapter of the Primer is organized into numbered paragraphs and sub-numbered sections, each chapter of recipes is numbered, and each recipe sub-numbered. Chapter Fourteen is ‚ÄúVegetables,‚Äù and ‚Äú14.19‚Äù is ‚ÄúStirred Dandelion.‚Äù Part One, ‚ÄúCooking and Eating,‚Äù like the opening grammatical section in Mandarin Primer, is a taxonomy. The book \\"never claims to be presenting an encyclopedic, region-by-region picture of Chinese cuisine in all its vastness and complexity\\", but evokes the \\"shape and feeling of the major Chinese cooking techniques and putting them to simple use in her recipes\\". The ingredients are generally limited to those available in the local markets in larger cities, though soy sauce, scallions, and sherry are used in most recipes. Fresh ginger is called for \\"if you can get it\\". Part One, \\"Cooking and Eating\\", begins with Chapter I \\"Introduction\\", and a description of \\"Meal Systems\\". This section includes an account of the types of meals eaten in different parts of China by different classes of people and explains the difference between a meal ‚Äî \\"fan, a period of rice\\" ‚Äî and a snack ‚Äî dian xin \\"something to dot the heart\\". Chao describes the customary behavior, for instance at the end of a banquet, with what Janet Theophano calls \\"a spirit of frivolity and playfulness\\". Individual chapters then deal with \\"Eating Materials\\", \\"Cooking Materials\\", \\"Cooking and Eating Utensils\\", \\"Methods of Readying\\", and \\"Methods of Cooking\\". Chapter V, \\"Methods of Readying\\" has sub-sections on \\"Cleaning\\", \\"Cutting, Picking etc.\\", \\"Mixing and Fixing\\", and \\"Precooking\\". Precise directions tell how to perform such tasks as \\"rolling knife pieces\\" () on a carrot or other crisp vegetable. There are detailed descriptions, observations, and directives on these cooking techniques. Sometimes humor colors the description, as with that of chao ( ch«éo), for which Chao created the English term \\"stir-fry\\": :with its aspiration, low-rising tone and all, cannot be accurately translated into English. Roughly speaking, ch'ao may be defined as a big-fire-shallow-fat- continual-stirring-quick-frying of cut-up material with wet seasoning. So we shall call it stir fry‚Ä¶ Part II is given over to recipes, including chapters on Red-Cook Meat, Meat Slices, Meat Shreds, Beef, Chicken, Duck, Fish, Vegetables, Soups, Pots, Sweet Things, and Pastry. A final chapter is \\"Meals and Menus\\". Reception and commentary The New York Times review of the 1945 first edition called it \\"something novel in the way of a cook book\\" and said that it \\"strikes us as being an authentic account of the Chinese culinary system, which is every bit as complicated as the culture that has produced it\\".Jane Holt \\"Cook Book Review,\\" New York Times 1945Quoted in Theophano, ‚ÄúHome Cooking,‚Äù p. 139. Later writers have seen the work as more than a collection of recipes. The American food writer Anne Mendelson calls How To Cook and Eat in Chinese \\"a vast departure from previous attempts to teach Chinese cooking to Americans\\". One historian sees the book as part of the larger story of cultural relations between the United States and China during the Open Door period. Janet Theophano wrote that How to Cook and Eat in Chinese is \\"more than a cookbook: It is the stage on which Mrs. Chao unfolds a personal, family, and cultural drama.\\" The book is a \\"double act of translation\\", she explains, for it interprets the techniques of Chinese cooking and the etiquette of eating Chinese meals for an American audience\\" and it \\"mirrors the act of translation required of immigrants adjusting to their adopted countries\\". Readers \\"also travel with Mrs. Chao on this more personal journey as she succinctly narrates her affectionate, sometimes tense, relationship with her family and the life experiences that compelled her to author this book\\".

It continued to draw a lesbian clientele into the 1950s. Mona's and the gay bars of that era were an important part of the history of LGBT culture in San Francisco.  History  Mona and Jimmie Sargeant, a married couple, opened Mona's in 1934 on Union Street, taking advantage of San Francisco's liberal attitude, endless supply of tourists, and the end of prohibition. In 1936, the couple moved the bar to a basement location on Columbus Avenue in North Beach. Originally, the couple imagined the club as a bohemian hangout for writers and artists. They covered the floors with sawdust to help create the \\"bohemian\\" atmosphere. Over the time, the vision of the club changed. The couple hired singing waitresses, and some fo the female waitresses dressed in male drag. The bar became modeled after other successful female impersonation or drag clubs like Finnochio's. In 1936, the San Francisco Chronicle published a \\"Cocktailing, Dancing, and Dining.\\" In the guide, Mona's was described as a \\"bohemian\\" club, which was a coded way of describing it as sexually unconventional. The bar became the first openly lesbian club that was geared towards the local gay community as opposed to gay tourists. Mona's marketed itself as a place \\"where girls can be boys\\" and featured female wait staff and entertainers dressed in tuxedos. Due to its popularity and growth in patronage, the bar moved to 440 Broadway Street in North Beach and was subsequently renamed Mona's 440 Club. The new space quickly became popular with both straight and gay patrons, including straight women looking to relax and unwind and tourists looking for a show. Mona's 440 Club was considered to be a part of the San Francisco sex tourism culture, however the bar stuck to cross dressing in order to remain lawful. During World War II the bar attracted women that were left at home who were looking for entertainment and the company of other women, friendly and romantic. In its later days, the bar also attracted servicemen on leave. In 1941, Mona relinquished control of the club to new manager, Babe Scott. Babe Scott was known as \\"the woman who plays baseball like a veteran.\\" Scott's legacy was the performers she brought to the club. Once Mona sold the club, entertainer Ann Dee, Angela DeSpirito, took over Mona's 440 Club in the mid 1950s and completely changed the direction of the club- starting with a new name, Ann's 440 Club. While the club still employed lesbian waitstaff and had lesbian clientele, its main focus was no longer on the queer culture and woman empowerment, but more focused on entertainment. Ann Dee wanted a place to be able to showcase her talents when she so desired and booked performers that fit her preferences. While under Ann Dee's ownership, the club gave Johnny Mathis his start. Gladys Bentley was a frequent entertainer at Mona's  Entertainment  One of the biggest draws to Mona's was their large variety of in house entertainment. Kay Scott and Babe Scott were part of the original group of entertainers to perform at Mona's 440 Club and due to their performances they became local San Francisco celebrities. The popularity of the performers drew in others who also wanted some of the same recognition. After taking control of the bar Babe Scott booked performers such as Tina Rubio, Gladys Bentley, Frances Faye, Moms Mabley and Beverly Shaw, the latter of whom became one of the club's headlining acts before moving to the Chi Chi Club across the street. Bentley remained one of Mona's most long running and popular residents due to her talent. She was a key part of Mona's culture with her cross dressing performance, as well as her ability to fit in with the growing popularity of sex and race tourism post prohibition. Bentley was recognized for her performances wearing a tuxedo and top hat. Eventually, she moved to Los Angeles to continue her career.  Legacy  Since its launch Mona's became one of the most popular lesbian bars in the United States and its popularity helped pave the way for more lesbian bars to open in the same neighborhood, making it a \\"well-known lesbian enclave\\".

Moxon Cook, was an Australian sports journalist who wrote as \\"Trumpator\\" for the Register and \\"Terlinga\\" for The Australasian. History Cook was born at \\"Ladywood\\", near Modbury, South Australia, the eldest son of William Cook (c. 1815 ‚Äì 18 November 1897), who arrived in SA aboard Rajasthan in 1837, and in 1855 married Janet Whitehead MacNee (c. 1836 ‚Äì December 1915), a daughter of Dr. John MacNee. They were a talented and literate family: Moxon's sister Edith Agnes Cook (1859‚Äì1942) was in 1876 the first female student at Adelaide University, and second principal of the Advanced School for Girls, and later, as Edith Agnes H√ºbbe, ran her own school. Katherine Dixon Cook (1874‚Äì1960) was a well-known musician and pianoforte teacher. Cook was a prize-winning student at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and early showed a love of sport, especially cricket, at which he displayed considerable ability. On leaving school began working for The Register, where his uncleHis mother's sister Agnes Macnee (c. 1843‚Äì1913) was John Howard Clark's second wife. John Howard Clark was editor. He left to work for the Central Roads Board, but the journalistic streak had not left him: from 1877 he contributed to his old employer occasional pieces on horse racing under the pen-name \\"Trumpator\\". In 1880, the sporting editor D. M. Magill retired, and Cook was appointed his replacement. He continued to write as \\"Trumpator\\", not only on the turf, but other sports as well. He had a deep understanding of the subject and wrote fearlessly but with such charm that he seldom ran into difficulties. His stories of the early days of South Australian racing were always interesting. In September 1892 he left Adelaide for Melbourne to replace E. S. Chapman, \\"Augur\\", as sporting editor of The Australasian, which had a reputation for sports writing second to none. He was treated to special farewells by the newspaper staff, by the Adelaide Savage Club, of which he was a member, and by a host of friends at his old watering-hole, the Globe Hotel on Rundle Street, at which Sir Richard Baker (then Chairman of the S.A.J.C.) presided. W. B. Carr, a longtime collaborator, took his place at the Register, under the byline \\"Tarquin\\". He served The Australasian for twenty five years, where his qualities of good sportsmanship, keen observation, and impartial criticism won for him a host of followers. > He possessed in a remarkable degree that journalistic quality whose first > interest is in the events of the day. He had a fine memory, and his long > experience mellowed his style, and gave a great charm to his writing; but he > utilised the fund of reminiscences on nearly every occasion to illumine the > subject of the hour, and not to exalt the past at the expense of the > present. ... He was as frank in writing as in conversation. What he saw he > chronicled with shrewdness and judgment, that which escaped him in the > rapidly moving picture he assimilated from his surroundings ... He was a man > of striking personality, and his tall and upright figure, his slow gait, > were as well known at Randwick or Morphettville as at Flemington or > Caulfield. Other interests were card playing and billiards, at which he excelled, and bowls, at which he was a keen player. He was a longstanding member of Melbourne's Yorick Club, and until his last illness would often be seen there. One of his last pieces for The Australasian, written in what he knew were his last days, was a remembrance of James Wilson, written in the reminiscent vein that made his writing so attractive. He died at his home, Orrong road, Elsternwick of cancer, which several operations had failed to halt. His funeral, held at the Brighton Cemetery, was well attended.

Written between 935‚Äì973, Dulcitius is widely believed to be her most comic work. The play treats the figure of Dulcitius, governor of Thessalonica, as a subject for a comedy in the style of Terence. Although the play is dark, with a plot that depicts the imprisonment and martyrdom of the three sisters, Agape, Chionia, and Irena, nevertheless its content is presumably deemed less grave because of the reward awaiting the Christian sufferers.  Plot  Agape, Chionia, and Irena depicted in the Menologion of Basil II The Roman Emperor Diocletian wants members of his imperial court to marry three virgin sisters: Agape, Chionia, and Irena. He insists the sisters renounce their Christian faith and worship the Roman gods. When they refuse, the emperor orders them imprisoned and examined by Governor Dulcitius. Dulcitius sees how beautiful the sisters are and tells his soldiers to lock them in the kitchen so he \\"can visit them oftener\\". That night Dulcitius embraces the pots and pans in the dark kitchen, thinking they are the women. He leaves covered in soot, and the soldiers think he is possessed. Not realizing he is covered in soot, Dulcitius goes to the palace to tell the imperial court he has been insulted. He is beaten and denied admittance to the palace because the ushers do not recognize him. In retaliation for his embarrassment, he commands that Agape, Chionia, and Irena be stripped in public. However, the soldiers are unable to remove the robes from the women's bodies. Since Dulcitius is sleeping, the soldiers tell Diocletian what has happened. The enraged emperor orders Count Sisinnius to punish the sisters. Sisinnius believes that the younger Irena will change her views if she is no longer influenced by her older sisters. He orders Agape and Chionia burned alive when they refuse to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Their spirits leave their bodies, but their bodies and clothes miraculously are not burned. Sisinnius threatens Irena with execution, but she refuses to renounce her faith. He orders the soldiers to take her to a brothel, but they quickly return and tell Sisinnius that Irena has escaped. Two men came to them and said Sisinnius wanted her taken to the top of a mountain. Sisinnius and the soldiers go to the mountain, but are unable to go up. As Irena stands at the top, Sisinnius orders one of the soldiers to shoot her with an arrow. She dies looking forward to heaven.

According to information she provided in Carmen de Primordiis Coenobii Gandersheimensis, she was born a long time after the death of Otto the Illustrious (November 30, 912), but was older than the daughter of Henry, Duke of Bavaria, Gerberga II (born after the year 940). Based on this information, Hrosvitha was born between 912 and 940, though historians generally agree that her date of birth is closer to 935. Hrosvitha divided her work into three books: Liber Primus, Liber Secundus, and Liber Tertius. The first book is poetry, while the second book has the six plays she is largely known for, including Dulcitius. The third book contains poetry and also the text from which historians have been able to deduce her approximate year of birth. The playwright Terence was an influence on Hrosvitha. She copied his style in the praising of virgins. In Hrosvitha's preface to her collection, she acknowledges Terence's influence, noting that her plays provide an alternative for those who appreciate Terence's style. Her approach substitutes \\"the laudable chastity of holy maidens\\" for his \\"unchaste actions of sensual women\\". This relationship between Terence and Hrosvitha represent a link between classical drama and the medieval morality plays.  Analysis  = Title and genre = The play's original title was Passio Sanctarum Virginum Agapis Chioniae Et Hirenae (\\"The Passion of the Holy Virgins Agape, Chionia, and Irena\\"), but has become more commonly known as Dulcitius because he serves as the central character in the comedic scenes. Dulcitius is considered to be Hrosvitha's most comedic work. However, just 56 lines out of 286 lines in the play are considered to be comedic and Dulcitius is only present in the first part of the play. Because of his limited presence, some have criticized Hrosvitha for creating no connection between the plotline of Dulcitius' adventures and that of the martyrdom of the three girls. = Portrayal of women = Hrosvitha's plays are believed to be aimed towards the Christian ideal of the virginal woman, and intended for reading rather than for performance. Her intention was likely for her plays to be read aloud by the Sisters of her convent. However, some scholars dismiss the solely Christian context of Hrosvitha's writings, instead claiming that her plays provided women with models for female integrity, thus encouraging more positive views of women.

The village of Vorizia (or Voriza) is built on the south slopes of Mt Ida, located approximately south of Heraklion. Its residents are primarily occupied with olive tree cultivation and pastoral farming. During the German occupation of Crete, residents of Vorizia participated or provided aid to the resistance. The first resistance group in the region was established in June 1941 by Georgios Petrakis (Petrakogiorgis) and five men from Vorizia. The razing On 15 August 1943, the resistance group of Petrakogiorgis clashed with a German force. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Petrakogiorgis and his band managed to escape after fierce fighting that lasted the whole day. The partisans lost seven men whereas the Germans thirteen. This conflict came to be known as the Battle of Trahili, owing its name to the area it took place.Œó ŒºŒ¨œáŒ∑ œÉœÑŒø Œ§œÅŒ±œáŒÆŒªŒπ œÉœÑŒπœÇ 15 ŒëœÖŒ≥ŒøœçœÉœÑŒøœÖ 1943, Œ†Œ±œÑœÅŒØœÇ onLine, 24 ŒëœÖŒ≥ŒøœçœÉœÑŒøœÖ 2012; archived here In reprisal for the help of locals to the partisans, General M√ºller ordered German forces to surround Vorizia on 27 August 1943. The villagers were led to the churchyard, three of them were summarily shot that day and two the next day. Later on, the others were driven out of the village and seven Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers appeared, dropping a total of 21 (presumably 50 kg) bombs. Following the bombing, the village ruins were doused with petrol and set on fire. Aftermath As a result of the bombing, Vorizia was completely destroyed and its residents were forced to seek shelter in nearby villages. After the war, the Greek state built a new settlement near the destroyed one. Nevertheless, the locals did not agree to relocate and chose to rebuild their village on the ruins on the destroyed one.

Bruun took part in neutrality protection duties during the First World War, seeing service on several naval vessels and assuming his first command. He continued his service in the inter-war years, teaching at naval schools in addition to shipboard service. At the outbreak of the Second World War Bruun again served on neutrality protection duties, commanding the destroyer . During the first day of the German invasion of Norway, √Üger intercepted a German supply ship, which Bruun ordered sunk before he knew for certain if Norway was under attack by the Germans or the Allies. Bruun's own ship was sunk by German bombers the same day, with the surviving crew members dispersing two days later with instructions from Bruun to try to continue to fight. Bruun escaped German- occupied Norway in 1941, travelling east through Sweden, the Soviet Union, India, and the United States to join the exiled Norwegian forces in the United Kingdom. Remaining in the United Kingdom for the duration of the war, Bruun led units training personnel and officers for the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy. Returning to Norway at the end of the Second World War, Bruun worked in the administration of the post-war Royal Norwegian Navy. He concluded his career as a rear admiral (acting) in command of the northernmost Norwegian naval command. During the eight years he held his last command, he played an important role in the establishment of the naval component of the Norwegian Home Guard. Early and personal life Bruun was born in Frederikshald, Norway, on 10 July 1893. He was the son of the merchant Ludvig Otto Bruun and Magdalene Elise Larsen. On 17 April 1920 Bruun married Haugesund-born Ingrid Sakkestad, three years his junior, in Haugesund. The couple had a daughter. Career In 1912, Bruun joined the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy as a cadet no. 651. Becoming an officer in the Royal Norwegian Navy on 1 October 1915, Bruun saw service on neutrality protection patrols during the First World War, serving as a second lieutenant on the gunboat from 9 October 1915 to 29 April 1916. After the end of the conflict, during which Norway remained neutral, he participated in minesweeping operations from 1918 to 1920. In November 1917, Bruun graduated from the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy and was promoted from second lieutenant to first lieutenant. From 1917 to 1920 he was in command of a torpedo boat. In the years that followed, he continued his military education with courses in torpedo warfare, naval gunnery and radio training. In the interwar period he served on Norwegian fishery protection vessels, torpedo boats, minelayers and coastal defence ships. He also served with the navigation department, the 1st Naval District Command and various training units. Amongst the ships on which Bruun served was the gunboat , where he served as a first lieutenant from 19 May 1931 to 1 October 1931. At the time, Sleipner was being used as a tender for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. In late 1931, Bruun served on the fishery protection vessel during a cruise to Finnmark in the far north of Norway. On 1 July 1931 he was temporarily promoted to the rank of acting captain, a promotion which was made permanent in December 1933. In mid-1932 Bruun held command of the torpedo boat , and by 1933, he was the second-in-command at the Royal Norwegian Navy's torpedo school. He also worked part-time as a teacher at the Royal Norwegian Navy's mine warfare school. =Second World War= The destroyer at sea, At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Norway declared itself neutral. To defend Norwegian territory from neutrality violations by the warring parties, the Royal Norwegian Navy mobilized. Bruun was put in command of the , one of the four modern destroyers then in Norwegian service. He was also the commander of the 1st Destroyer Division, consisting of the destroyers √Üger, , and . Initially √Üger and the other ships of the 1st Destroyer Division were part of the 1st Naval District and were based in Kristiansand, in the south of Norway. The outbreak of the Finno-Soviet Winter War in late 1939 caused Bruun and the 1st Destroyer Division to be despatched to Northern Norway to protect Norwegian neutrality. With the end of the Winter War in March 1940, the warships then in Northern Norway were redeployed separately along the coast to carry out neutrality patrols. By April 1940, Bruun's destroyer √Üger was deployed to the 2nd Naval District, based at Tananger and patrolling the coast between the port city of Stavanger and Haugesund. In addition to √Üger, the area between Stavanger and Haugesund was guarded by the old destroyer , the torpedo boat Stegg, the patrol boat and Motorboat no. 7. Aircraft from the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service and the Norwegian Army Air Service assisted in patrolling the coastline. German invasion In the early hours of 8 April, Bruun was ordered to patrol with √Üger off J√¶ren and look for suspicious activity, after the British claimed to have laid a naval minefield in the area. By 09:00 he returned to Tananger and reported to his superiors that nothing out of the ordinary had been observed. Thereafter Bruun brought √Üger to Stavanger to restock provisions and carry out maintenance on the destroyer's weapons. The destroyer had only two torpedoes on board. At 22:00 Bruun was ordered by naval command to increase his ship's readiness and prepare for potential war. After hearing on the NRK radio news of the sinking of the German vessel off the Norwegian port of Lillesand, and reports of German warship movements in the Kattegat south of Norway, Bruun was increasingly concerned about the situation. On 9 April 1940, Germany carried out a surprise invasion of Norway, attacking strategic ports along the Norwegian coast. Six naval task forces carried out landings at points from Oslo in the south-east to Narvik in the north of Norway. In addition to the naval landing forces, airborne troops were despatched against the strategically important airports at Sola near Stavanger and Fornebu near Oslo. The German supply ship sinking on 9 April 1940 As part of their invasion plan, the Germans sent several supply ships to Norway separately from the invasion force itself. One of the supply ships, which were camouflaged as civilian merchant ships, was the German freighter . Loaded with supplies for German airborne troops set to seize Sola Airport on 9 April 1940, Roda had set sail from Hamburg on 7 April and arrived at Stavanger in time for the invasion. Roda had anchored off Hundv√•g to await the arrival of German invasion forces. The most important of the cargo on board Roda were heavy anti-aircraft guns and four 21 cm coastal artillery pieces meant to secure the Stavanger area once the Germans had seized it. Shortly after midnight on 9 April Bruun was alerted by the local police and customs officials of the presence of Roda. The officials were suspicious of the ship, as the crew claimed she was loaded with 7,000 tonnes of coke despite the ship appearing to be a passenger/cargo vessel and was riding high in the water for such a heavy cargo. The ship's hatches were blocked by being covered with coke, preventing inspection. The suspicion was further heightened by reports coming in of neutrality violations taking place in Eastern Norway. By 01:05 customs officers boarded √Üger and conferred with Bruun about the situation. After meeting with the police, Bruun ordered an inspection of Roda. Before despatching a seven-strong boarding crew led by his second-in-command to Roda, Bruun was approached by the German consulate in Stavanger, whose representatives requested to be let on board the German ship, requests which Bruun rejected. Before boarding Roda, Bruun spoke with his commanding officer, Admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen on the telephone. Tank- Nielsen supported Bruun's decision to inspect the German ship. Tank-Nielsen also told Bruun to act on his own judgement in case the military situation escalated in Norway. The military commander in Stavanger, Colonel Gunnar Sp√∏rck, had also requested that Roda be inspected, as he feared the ship carried German troops, but his message never reached Bruun. While the boarding crew were away, Bruun received a message from the 2nd Naval District by radio, informing him that the forts in the Oslofjord were in action against unidentified warships. Requests on the part of Bruun regarding the nationality of the intruding foreign ships were never answered. When the boarding crew returned from Roda, they reported that they had been prevented from properly inspecting the ship's cargo. The German captain had opposed the boarding crew in their attempt to access the ship's cargo holds. At 04:15 Bruun received a new report from the 2nd Naval District, informing him that unidentified foreign warships were forcing their way towards the city of Bergen. A follow- up radio message relaying the identity of the intruding warships as German, did not reach Bruun. Relying on the reports he had received, and what he had heard on the radio news, Bruun reasoned that he could not be certain if the intruders were German or British. While awaiting clarification of the situation, he decided to seize Roda as a prize and move his own and the German ship to further to the south. An eight-man prize crew was despatched to Roda with instructions to replace the German flag with the Norwegian naval ensign, disable the ship's radio transmitter, and order the German captain to move to Riskafjord. After the German captain had refused to follow the instructions of the prize crew, Bruun threatened him with opening fire, but the crew on Roda kept delaying while awaiting the coming German invasion. By 06:00 Bruun concluded that it was taking too long for Roda to start her engines, and decided to sink the German ship. Although still not certain about which warring party was attacking Norway, and out of contact with his superiors and other military units, Bruun wanted to end the situation and free up his ship for other tasks. After Bruun had recalled his prize crew and ordered the German crew to abandon ship in their lifeboats, he ordered his gunners to sink the German vessel. √Üger first fired 25 \\"cold\\" 10 cm rounds (non-explosive shells intended for use as warning shots rather than warfare) into Rodas starboard side, then a further 25 cold rounds into the German ship's port side. Before Rodas captain abandoned ship, he radioed a message describing the situation. Picked up by another German ship in the area, , the message had been relayed to the invasion headquarters in Hamburg, Germany. The crew of √Üger was stunned by Bruun's order to open fire, which he had to repeat three times before they carried it out. By 08:00 Roda was sinking slowly, finally disappearing beneath the surface by the afternoon of 9 April and settling at a depth of . The bombed-out wreck of √Üger Shortly after shelling Roda, √Üger observed German aircraft, sightings which revealed the identity of the invaders. √Üger opened fire at the aircraft with her anti-aircraft armament. The first wave of German aircraft avoided √Üger, but soon after 8‚Äì10 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers from the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 4, thought by Bruun to have been called in by Rodas captain, attacked √Üger with machine-gun fire and bombs. The Ju 88s had been attacking Sola Airport, before turning their attention to √Üger. Although the German military headquarters in Germany knew of √Üger, the Luftwaffe bombers off Stavanger most likely attacked because √Üger had opened fire first. Bruun made evasive manoeuvres in the off Stavanger and headed for the more open waters of the nearby Byfjorden. The anti-aircraft gunners on √Üger returned fire at the German bombers, and claimed to have downed two of them. At 08:30 √Üger was struck by a German 250 kg bomb midships, which wrecked the destroyer, killing eight crew members and wounding a further three. As the destroyer was dead in the water and appeared to be sinking, Bruun ordered his crew to man the lifeboats and abandon ship in order to make their way to the island of Hundv√•g. The German bombers kept attacking the stationary √Üger until Bruun ordered the ship's colours to be struck. The wreck of √Üger later drifted ashore on Hundv√•g. Following the loss of √Üger, Bruun initially retained command of the 57 unwounded survivors of his crew, with the intent of bringing them as a unit to join up with other forces fighting the German invasion elsewhere in Norway. Initially Bruun tried to locate and join up with the local land forces commanded by Colonel Sp√∏rck. As German forces were in control of the Stavanger area and were blocking communications, Bruun eventually dismissed his crew on 11 April, instructing them to make their way in small groups out of the area to continue the fight. Some members of the crew managed to escape the Stavanger region and fight in other areas of South Norway. Exile In 1941 Bruun escaped from German-occupied Norway to neutral Sweden. In a three-month journey, he made his way from Sweden to the Soviet Union, passing through Moscow and Baku on his way to India, then travelling through the United States before making the final stretch from New York City to the United Kingdom. After making his way to the United Kingdom, Bruun joined the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. From 1941 to 1942 he commanded the Royal Norwegian Navy's training unit at Port Edgar in Scotland. In 1942 he was promoted to the rank of commander, and from February that year headed the ' ‚Äì the unit responsible for training enlisted personnel and non- commissioned officers for the Royal Norwegian Navy. Starting on 18 June 1943 he also commanded the exiled Royal Norwegian Naval Academy. Part of Bruun's job as head of the Sj√∏milit√¶re korps in exile was to formalize and bring order to the improvized system of recruitment employed by low-level commanders up until that point. Each warship commander had in the early phase of the Royal Norwegian Navy's time in exile personally recruited and employed crew members for his ship. At the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy, which had been re- established in the United Kingdom in January 1943, Bruun played a central role in adapting the academy to the conditions of war and exile. The academy's curriculum changed, with an increased focus on practical training. On Bruun's initiative, the academy in 1944 replaced its old entrance requirement for cadets to a new one adapted to the conditions of exile in the United Kingdom. While the old requirements had included secondary education and prior service in the merchant navy, the new ones required Examen artium qualifications in science and mathematics. The reform was motivated by a lack of potential cadets with a background in the merchant navy, combined with an ample supply of university students amongst Norwegian refugees who had made their way to neutral Sweden. One Norwegian naval cadet who joined the Royal Norwegian Navy in the United Kingdom in August 1941 described Bruun as having an informal and encouraging way of interacting with lower ranking naval personnel, instilling in the cadet \\"a feeling of security\\" as well as \\"eagerness and a go-ahead spirit\\". During the Allied operations in Norway following the German surrender in May 1945, Bruun was deployed to Naval Command Mid-Norway as a district commander, based in √Ölesund. He held this position until May 1946. =Post- war= Bruun continued to command both Sj√∏milit√¶re korps and the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy until 1 May 1946, when he transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy High Command, where he led the command section. The re- establishment of the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy on Norwegian soil in late 1945 proved a challenging task for Bruun. The buildings in Horten, which the academy had used until the German invasion in 1940, had been taken over by other military institutions by the time Bruun returned to Norway. Horten's military facilities had suffered heavily from bombing during the war years, with many buildings completely destroyed. Without asking for permission from his military superiors, Bruun decided to move the academy to Oslo, requisitioning several former German wooden barracks in in Sagene as the academy's temporary new home. Bruun was criticized by his superiors for his unauthorized act, but the academy was allowed to stay in the buildings he had taken over. In 1945 he unsuccessfully applied for four different positions within the Royal Norwegian Navy: a promotion to the rank of rear admiral and command of Naval Command East, a promotion to the rank of rear admiral and command of Naval Command West, a promotion to the rank of commodore and command of Naval Command Tr√∏ndelag, and a promotion to the rank of rear admiral and command of Naval Command North. The following year, 1946, he was promoted to the rank of commodore. In the period 1948 to 1949 he held temporary command of Naval Command Southern Norway. From November 1949 to 1957 he was in charge of Naval Command Northern Norway, holding the rank of acting rear admiral. During his last assignment Bruun's headquarters was located first in the city of Troms√∏, then in Harstad. In 1951 he unsuccessfully applied for three different positions: a promotion to the rank of permanent rear admiral and command of Naval Command Western Norway, a position as commodore and commander of Naval Command Southern Norway, and a promotion to the rank of permanent rear admiral and command of Naval Command Eastern Norway. He retired from the Royal Norwegian Navy on 1 January 1957. During his years in Northern Norway, Bruun played a role in the establishment of the naval component of the Norwegian Home Guard. In mid-1949, he was one of five high-ranking and mid-level officers who held discussions with the commander of the Royal Norwegian Navy, Admiral Edvard Christian Danielsen, during the latter's fact-finding mission to Northern Norway in connection with a potential establishment of a Naval Home Guard. These discussions led to the first courses being held 1951, at Reine in the Lofoten Islands, within Bruun's area of command. From Northern Norway, the Naval Home Guard was expanded to the other regions of Norway. Bruun's involvement with the establishment of the Naval Home Guard has led to some authors referring to him as \\"the father of the Naval Home Guard\\". Bruun was enthusiastic about expanding the Home Guard from a solely land-based force to one which included a branch that operated along the coast using requisitioned fishing vessels. Bruun provided the Naval Home Guard in his region with ample supplies of equipment, ammunition and explosives, and flexible rules of operation. This attitude set Bruun aside from many of his colleagues, who did not see a role for the Royal Norwegian Navy in cooperating with the Naval Home Guard. Bruun also promoted closer cooperation between the Naval Home Guard and the Norwegian Coast Guard in patrolling the coastline, and in inspecting and detaining fishing vessels operating in breach of Norwegian laws. In addition to his military work, Bruun wrote several journal articles on naval matters, including a 1936 article in the naval journal Norsk tidsskrift for sj√∏vesen detailing his views on the future role and disposition of aircraft in the Norwegian Armed Forces. In 1949 Bruun contributed two articles to the 60th anniversary book of the Stavanger Military Association, one on the naval strategic value of Rogaland and Stavanger, and another on his experiences as the commander of the destroyer √Üger on 9 April 1940. In addition to military-oriented articles, Bruun in 1932 wrote a piece published in the newspaper Aftenposten, detailing his experiences celebrating Christmas in Finnmark in 1931, including a visit and performance by star boys on board his ship while at anchor in the town of Vard√∏. Bruun died in Oslo on 11 July 1970, and was buried at the cemetery Vestre gravlund in Oslo on 14 August 1970. Honours and awards For his service in exiled Norwegian forces Bruun was awarded the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal and the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945. In 1949 he received the St. Olav's Medal with Oak Branch as further recognition for his wartime service, specifically for his efforts during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign.

It is the latest in a succession of purpose-built hackney carriages produced by LEVC and various predecessor entities. The LEVC TX is a plug-in hybrid range-extender electric vehicle. Like its competitor, the Ecotive Metrocab, the vehicle is designed to comply with Transport for London‚Äôs Taxi Private Hire regulations, which from 1 January 2018, banned new diesel-powered taxis and requires zero-emissions capability. Background Geely has been in talks over the possibility of converting London's black cabs into electric-powered vehicles. The company said it has held talks with UK government officials about the plan. In May 2016, Geely secured $400 million (¬£308,200,000) for the project, with the aim of manufacturing 36,000 vehicles per annum at its new Coventry, England plant. The LEVC TX electric hybrid is manufactured at a new facility in Ansty, from Coventry. Technical The LEVC TX is built on a unique platform, underpinned by a bonded aluminium chassis built in the UK, giving the LEVC TX a 32 percent parts localisation rate by value. China and Europe each account for 32 percent of the content, while United States content is 4 percent. The LEVC TX is powered by a full-electric hybrid drivetrain. It drives in full-electric mode all the time, but is recharged by an 81-hp Volvo sourced 1.5-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine. The LEVC TX is fitted with a 33 kilowatt-hour battery pack supplied by LG Chem, and powers a 110 kW Siemens built electric motor for traction. When the battery pack has insufficient charge to power the vehicle, the petrol engine is claimed to achieve 36.7 mpg. The charge connectors are mounted either side of the radiator grille, and are a CCS socket, capable of 50 kW DC and 22 kW AC, and an optional 50 kW capable CHAdeMO connector. Service history The TX took advantage of 2018 Transport for London rules that allowed only zero-emission capable vehicles to become additions to the city's taxi fleet. By February 2018 it was the only taxi capable of meeting these rules.

To the east of Achnahaird Bay is Garvie Bay, with a small sandy beach. Slightly Further east is the small Lag na Saille inlet. Polly bay is further to the east and north, close to the small rocky Green island. To the north of Polly bay is the sea loch, Loch an √àisg Brachaidh located to the west of the group of small islands. The bay has a number of small islands, of which Eilean M√≤r, located on the northeast corner of the bay is the largest. Fraochlan Island located less than quarter mile north is the next smallest, followed by the Eilean M√≤ineseach. Green Island is a small island located to the south in the southeast of the bay. A number of small fast flowing streams flow into the bay, the biggest amongst them is the River Polly, which flows into the Polly bay inlet.

She supported Michael Goldberg with international video exchange projects which resulted in the Matrix Video Conference tape exchange and eight International Video Exchange Directories (1971 to 1981)‚Äîall of which form the basis of the current collection. Dahl is an practicing artist and serves as a volunteer at The Crista Dahl Media Library & Archives.  Artistic practice  An active artist in Vancouver's early experimental art community, Crista Dahl (known then as Crista Preus) was a member of Intermedia. At the end of Intermedia, she joined Video Inn (now known as VIVO Media Arts Centre), one of the artist-run organization which emerged in Intermedia's wake. In the early days of Video Inn, she participated in the development of the organization's collectively managed screening, production, archiving and domestic space at 261 Powell Street. She was a resident at this location for a time and recounts the collectively shared meals prepared by members of Vancouver's early media art community in an interview with the authors of Anamnesia. Crista Dahl's interest in pre- and early cultural history informed participatory art projects, which engaged the public (often in schools) in hands-on activities using organic materials and performance. Crista Dahl's art and art teaching were supported by educational and arts funding. Committed to alternative education processes and models, she worked for Vancouver Society for Total Education and helped to develop and administer an educational program for under-served youth called Intensive Childcare Resource. In 1972 she received, with psychologist Carol Aellen, a grant of $14,040 in federal funding through a program called \\"Local Initiatives.\\" The funding resulted in a project with hands-on workshops based on the development of human culture, including language, ritual, technologies and time. Over all named the Life Rhythm project (1966 - 1970, 2013), her workshops, performances, and media installation about concepts of time and space, have been presented at Vancouver Art Gallery, Simon Fraser University, Surrey Art Centre, Burnaby Art Gallery and University of British Columbia, among others. A retrospective of her art was exhibited at VIVO Media Arts Centre in 2013. It included Life Rhythm as well as drawings, paintings and sculpture.

In early adulthood, she moved to San Francisco where she was involved in Haight-Ashbury culture. Her move with her four children to Canada in 1971 was motivated by a desire for her husband (John Preus), and potentially her children, to avoid the US Army draft. They settled in Lund, British Columbia where Dahl informally taught art to children and developed an independent research interest in archeology, through, for example Will and Ariel Durant's The Story of Civilization which she found in the Powell River Library near Lund.

He is also the author of the currently accepted force-current analogy in physics known as the Trent analogy. Education and early career Trent was born in Bradley County, Tennessee to his mother Lida L. Trent. His early years were spent on a family farm with his mother and sister, Jean. He earned his Bachelor's degree from Berea College in 1929. By 1930 he was living with his mother in Starkville, Mississippi in a boarding house. He obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. from Indiana University where his thesis was on diaphragmless microphones. While working on his degrees he served on the faculties of Indiana University, Mississippi State, and Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College He began his career as a member of the Physics Department at Mississippi State University in the early 1930s. In 1933, he married Eva Mae Manes of Indiana, who was also an Indiana University graduate, and they had two daughters, Marilyn and Sandra. While at MSU he became the faculty advisor for the Sigma Pi colony there and he was initiated into the organization when the colony became a chapter. In 1935 he was promoted to assistant professor and then to associate professor two years later. Naval Research Laboratory Trent left Mississippi State in 1940 to accept an appointment at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), where he eventually became head of the Applied Mathematics Branch. His expertise in acoustics brought him an appointment to a special naval team assigned to do technical intelligence work on sound devices developed by the Nazis in Germany after World War II. By 1960, he was the supervisor of the Research Computation Center. Trent's wife, Eva Mae, was also a mathematician in the Atmosphere and Astrophysics Division of NRL. In 1963, the NRL granted both of them a leave of absence to study and make recommendations for changes to Dartmouth College‚Äôs engineering sciences curriculum. The Ford Foundation financed the grant for his study of the college's mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering courses. While at the NRL, Trent was able to keep teaching. He was an associate professor at the University of Maryland where he also became the Sigma Pi chapter there's faculty advisor. Noted work In 1958, Trent was part of a team, along with Barry Bernstein and Donald A. Hall, that made the discovery of what causes a bullwhip‚Äôs crack. At the time, it was thought to be caused by leather in the tip smacking against other leather as it curled back in on itself. Bernstein, Trent, and Hall proved that it was really the whip exceeding the sound barrier. In 1955 Trent wrote what is now called the Trent analogy to describe a power conjugate pair using through and across variables in linear graph form.Busch-Vishniac, Ilene J., Electromechanical Sensors and Actuators, Springer Science & Business Media, 1999 ., Pgs. 19-20 Although he was not the first person to use the through and across variables, his work is still regarded as the modern understanding of through and across.Findeisen, Dietmar, System Dynamics and Mechanical Vibrations, Springer, 2000 ., Pg. 26 Trent was also noted for his activities in the field of standardization. He served as the US Navy's Project Officer for Mechanical Shock and Vibration, was a member of the Tripartite (American, British, Canadian) Standardization committee, and was a member of the International Organization for Standards on the ISO/TC 37 committee. Other Work He served on the editorial boards for the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America and the Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics. He was also a member of the Cosmos Club. He became a member of the governing board of the American Institute of Physics in 1963. He also held nine patent in such fields as underwater sound and mechanics.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Description The eclipse was visible in many parts of the South Pacific Ocean. Very few portions occurred over land including New Zealand except for Auckland and the northernmost portion of North Island, islands such as the Chatham Islands, Antipodes, Marquesas Tahiti and Tuamotu, the westernmost fringes of the Antarctica including its peninsula and the westernmost areas of South America including most of the Andes Mountains in Chile, westernmost Argentina, much of Peru, the southwesternmost of Colombia and Ecuador especially the Galapagos. It was part of solar saros 117. The umbral portion which was as far as 414 km (257 mi) and started at the peninsular portion of Antarctica, the rest was in the Pacific Ocean. The greatest occurred in the Pacific Ocean at 42.5 S & 119.4 W at 21:55 UTC (1:55 PM local time) and lasted for over 4 minutes. The eclipse was up to around 20% obscured in many parts of New Zealand and around 10% in Tahiti. The eclipse started at sunrise in New Zealand and finished at Sunset in South America mainly at a part of the Andes Mountains. The eclipse was obscured by clouds in Dunedin. It was visible from Timaru further north, but was not visible due to clouds on Banks Peninsula. Wellington also experienced heavy cloud cover and the eclipse was thus not visible.

The species is an endemic of the highlands of Ethiopia and eastern Africa.  Description  Haplocarpha rueppellii is a creeping perennial plant that can grow into dense mats. cited on = Roots, stems and leaves = There are many thick, almost tuberous roots, emerging from a rootstock of 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter creeping at the soil surface. The shiny, somewhat fleshy green leaves have a short leaf stalk that may have spiderweb-like hairs at their base. The leaf blade varies between almost round, ovate, or longish, diamond or inverted egg- shaped, 2‚Äì13 cm long, 1‚Äì7¬Ω cm wide, with the base gradually narrowing, rounded or hart-shaped, the margin entire to scalloped, with shallow irregular teeth, saw-shaped or almost lobed, the leaf tip pointy, blunt or rounded and the teeth may be ending in a soft spine. The upper leaf surface with few or may hairs or even hairy like a spiderweb, the lower leaf surface with densely felty beneath with spiderweb hairs. = Inflorescences = The stalk of the flowerhead is pinkish in color, somewhat flattened, with shallow wings, 1‚Äì11 cm long, widest at the clasping base, up to 8 mm wide. Usually every rosette carries several slender, felty, pinkish, leafless, erect scapes of up to 13 cm, sometimes swollen beneath the single flower head. Each flowerhead is 1¬Ω‚Äì5 cm in diameter. The involucre consists of two or three, sometimes four worls of linear to narrowly ovate or inverted egg-shaped bracts, each 4‚Äì12 mm long and 1‚Äì3 mm wide, with papery margins, covered with many of few hairs. The common base of the florets (called receptacle) is 3‚Äì4 mm across, has the shape of a shallow, slightly hollowed dome, which may or may not carry a scale at the foot of each floret. = Florets = Along the outside are eight to sixteen spreading yellow ray florets, which are ovate, elliptic or egg-shaped, although about ‚Öõ is tube-shaped. Each ray floret is 1‚Äì2¬Ω cm long, 2‚Äì6 mm wide, entire or sometimes with mostly one to three teeth at the tip and mostly four or five veins, hairless or with scattered multicellular hairs on the lower surface. In the centre of the flowerhead are mostly between twenty and forty (sometimes as few as eleven) yellow and urn-shaped disk florets, of 3¬Ω‚Äì7 mm long, which divide into five triangular lobes, ‚Öì of the length of the floret, that spread or bend down, and do not have hair. = Fruits and seeds = The one-seeded indehiscent fruits are not embedded in the common base of the florets receptacle, is inverted cone-shaped or oblong, has three or four ribs, is at least 3 mm long, and half as wide, with a smooth surface or with tiny wrinkles and hearless. At the tip is one row of scales (the pappus) of ¬Ω‚Äì1 mm long, that are free in the outer florets, but merged at their foot in disc florets. These scales are split into twelve to fifteen standing, awl-shaped lobes, with a long, narrow tip, divided in side-lobes and without hair. = Variability = The upper leaf surface of plants of Haplocarpha rueppellii growing on Mount Elgon are consistently densely covered in multicellular hairs. Elsewhere, hairiness varies between specimens in the same population. Scholars therefore are reluctant to assign the form from Mount Elgon to a variety different from the typical form.  Taxonomy  In 1848 Carl Heinrich 'Bipontinus' Schultz described Schnittspahnia rueppellii, which he assigned to the Annonaceae, based on a specimen that was collected by Eduard R√ºppell and Georg Wilhelm Schimper, from high elevations in the Semien Mountains in Ethiopia, and now reside in the Kew herbarium. Georg Carl Wilhelm Vatke realised this plant belonged to the Asteraceae, and renamed it to Landtia rueppellii in 1875. Karl August Otto Hoffmann thought the species should be assigned to the genus Arctotis, creating the new combination A. rueppellii in 1895. A plant collected by Ernest Edward Galpin on Mount Kinangop in the southern Aberdare Range of Kenya, and also kept at Kew, was regarded different enough by the very young John Hutchinson, who named it Landtia lobulata in 1914. Gustave Beauverd merged the genus Landtia with Haplocarpha, and created the new combination H. rueppellii in 1915. Later, in 1930, Hutchinson and Marion Beatrice Moss described a plant collected by Arthur Disbrowe Cotton on Mount Kilimanjaro, since stored at Kew, naming it Landtia kilimanjarica. All of these names are now regarded synonymous. = Phylogeny = Comparison of DNA of species assigned to the subtribe Arctotidinae has cast doubt on the monophyly of the genus Haplocarpha. The type species, H. lanata, seems most related to H. lyrata and Arctoteca calundula. H. rueppellii and H. nervosa on the other hand appear to be the first branch to split from the remaining species in the subtribe. If this finding is robust, reinstatement of Landtia has been suggested, meaning our species would have to be called Landtia rueppellii.  Distribution  In Kenya H. rueppellii can for instance be found at Mount Elgon, in Mau Forest, on Mount Kenya. In Tanzania it can be found at the Kilimanjaro complex, such as on the Shira Plateau. In Ethiopia it has been registered in the Bale Mountains. The plant also may occur elsewhere in highlands in Ethiopia, eastern Africa and possibly South Africa.  Habitat and ecology  In Dodola Forest, at the north flank of the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia, H. rueppellii occurs in several different plant communities, obviously with different other species. In the Hagenia abyssinica-Hypericum revolutum-community it occurs with Alchemilla abyssinica, A. fischerii, Asparagus africanus, Crepis rueppellii, Cynoglossum caeruleum, Euphorbia schimperii, Hydrocotyle mannii, Kalanchoe petitiana and Satureja paradoxa in the herbaceous layer. This species grows at an altitude of 2250‚Äì4650 m.

Fay and her husband were first stationed at Fort Ethan Allen near Washington, D.C. to protect the capital. They remained here until 1863. Afterwards, the regiment moved to Suffolk, Virginia for their first actions. Fay was present at these actions, which included a siege lasting for multiple days. Fay, however, was fearless under rebel fire. The regiment next moved to Yorktown, where Fay continued her nursing duties. Fay built a rapport with the soldiers of the regiment. During marches, Fay shared much of the experience with soldiers, including carrying her own supplies as well the supplies of injured regiment members. Fay also acted as a scout at one point, to locate Confederate forces. Fay would also, in her work, listen to the stories of African American citizens, only furthering her reputation for kindness.  Later years  After the war, Fay served as president of the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War.

There are many reverting farm fields and old apple orchards coupled with many oaks with their acorns that complete the mixed habitat. ‚ÄúThe variety offers a very nice opportunity, really quite a pleasant landscape for deer hunting,‚Äù says regional wildlife biologist Jim Connolly of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. That helps explain why Frye Mountain is a popular destination for Maine hunters.http://www.fieldandstream.com/node/1006038062 History Frye Mountain was originally home to farming families, but in the late 1930s, the United States government obtained much of the land on and around Frye Mountain through the Bankhead Jones Farm Tenant Act. Proposed in 1937, the act was amended several times before passage, but ultimately ‚Äúoffered low interest loans, with stipulations on maintenance and proper farming practices, hopefully to encourage families to work on improving what might eventually be their own property,‚Äù according to a history prepared by the Montville Historical Society. Even prior to purchase of property in Montville, some work was being done by the government in anticipation of its becoming part of Lake St. George State Park. According to a May 1936 article in The Republican Journal, there were several options being considered for the less than 1,000-acre area. At the time it seemed most likely to become a recreational area, including camping, swimming and picnic areas, as well as hiking trails. ‚ÄúThe idea one gets is that it will be somewhat similar to the Belfast City Park,‚Äù the article states. Frye Mountain became home to a game management district instead and in 1985 was renamed Gene Letourneau Wildlife Management Area, after a longtime outdoor sportswriter from Waterville. The name change was protested with a petition signed by 400 who believed the name change was disrespectful to the original families who lived on Frye Mountain. Most of the Frye Mountain homes are completely gone, with only a marker noting the presence of a structure. Some still wonder what was said to homeowners by government representatives regarding purchase of their property, based on stories of a few holdouts, as well as tales of homes burned and torn down. Also gone is a fire tower that sat atop Frye Mountain ‚Äî it was moved to Swan Island in the Kennebec River in 2002 ‚Äî that was staffed between 1931 and 1991 with people trained to spot forest fires.http://waldo.villagesoup.com/p/a-ride-back-through-time-on-frye- mountain/1419388 Another use of Frye Mountain is by the Maine Army National Guard (MEARNG) which began in 1968 through a land use agreement between the MEARNG and Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW). In 1973, they signed an agreement with the IFW to develop a combination rifle-pistol firing range, which was in use until 1983. In 2003, lead removal activities were conducted at the firing range. Currently, the land use agreement for Frye Mountain has expired and has not been renewed.http://64.78.11.86/uxofiles/enclosures/frye-mountain.pdf References Wildlife management areas of Maine Protected areas of Waldo County, Maine Protected areas established in 1985 1985 establishments in Maine ","title":"Gene Letourneau (Frye Mountain) WMA"},{"id":"53579477","text":"Pristimantis ecuadorensis (common name: Ecuadorian rainfrog) is a species of rainfrogs endemic to Ecuador. It is only known from three nearby localities on the western slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes in the Cotopaxi and Pichincha Provinces. Prior to its description as a new species in 2017, it was mixed with Pristimantis ornatissimus. As currently defined, Pristimantis ornatissimus occurs at elevations below , whereas Pristimantis ecuadorensis is known from above sea level. Description Adult males measure (based on two specimens only) and females (based on four specimens) in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is relatively robust. Skin is smooth. The snout is rounded. The canthus rostralis is distinct. The tympanum is oval and conspicuous. Fingers have small discs and dermal fringes but lack webbing. Also the toes have dermal fringes but lack webbing; the toe discs are expanded into pads. The dorsum is greenish yellow with transverse black stripes that may form a reticulated pattern. There are black canthal and interorbital stripes. Forearms and legs are greenish yellow with black bars. The venter is uniform yellow. The iris is light blue to grayish green or grayish yellow. Habitat and ecology Pristimantis ecuadorensis is known from primary forest as well as banana and sugar cane plantations bordering native forest. They are closely associated with the leaf axils of bromeliads, Heliconia plants and fronds of Ceroxylon and Wettinia palms. They may be found perching on top of leaves or inside leaf axils some above the ground, creased leaves, or moss of epiphytic plants. Males have also been heard calling from these microhabitats. Fecal samples suggest that their diet consists of various arthropods, containing the remains of beetles, crickets and spiders. Conservation The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not yet assessed this species, but following their criteria, the new species probably qualifies as \\"Endangered\\". Once relatively abundant, it appears to have declined in abundance in its type locality, and its distribution area is small. Habitat loss is also affecting its range.

Kaier Company was a beer brewery in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, that produced Kaier's brand beer from 1880 to 1968 under a succession of corporate identities. The company was sold to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's, Ortlieb Brewing Company in 1966, and ceased producing beer in 1968. History =Predecessor company= Charles D. Kaier was born Anslem Troian Kaier in Binningen, Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany, on March 6, 1837, the son of blacksmith Andreas and Cresentia (Wittmer) Kaier. He had two brothers, Xavier and George, and two sisters. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1854 at age 15 or in 1857 at age 19 (Scroll down to magazine article.) (accounts differ). Living in Norristown and St. Clair, Pennsylvania, he served three months in a Pennsylvania volunteer infantry company during the American Civil War, and was honorably discharged. At some point, he Americanized his name to Charles D. Kaier. After marrying teacher Margaret Curry, the daughter of Irish immigrants, Kaier settled in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, and became an agent for the Philadelphia brewery Bergner and Engle. He entered the liquor business in 1862, founding the Chas. D. Kaier Co., purchasing barrels of whiskey from distillers and transferring the liquid to quart and pint bottles for retail sale. As well, he dabbled in packaging and selling beer for local breweries. =Brewery= In the late 1870s, Kaier brought his cousin Franz Kaier from Germany to attend the American Brewing Academy in Chicago, Illinois, and eventually serve as brewmaster for Kaier's new concern, a beer brewery formed in 1880 as the Chas. D. Kaier Brewery. By one account, it was Chas. D. Kaier & Co. Brewery from 1882 to 1884, then the Francis X. Kaier Brewery through 1891, and the Chas. D. Kaier Brewing Co. through 1894, when it was renamed the Chas. D. Kaier Co. Ltd. Brewery. It retained that name for 26 years, until the advent of Prohibition in 1920. Until that law's repeal in 1933, the firm was known as the Kaier Brewing Co. Another account gives the corporate name as the Chas D. Kaier Brewing Co. from 1891 to 1894, and the Chas D. Kaier Co., Ltd. thereafter through 1966.Lieberman, American Breweriana Journal, sidebar \\"Almost never a brewery!\\", p. 6 However, a 1932 court case identifies the concern as the Charles D. Kaier Company, Inc. During Prohibition, the company continuing operating under a permit to manufacture cereal beverages such as low-alcohol beer. The Kaier Brewing Co. regularly secured an annual permit for this until 1930, when U.S. Prohibition Commissioner James M. Doran declined to renew it. A district court ordered the administrator to renew the permit, but this decision was reversed on appeal.

After serving as a professor of microbiology and immunology at Emory for 15 years, Ahmed was named to the Charles Howard Candler Professorship of microbiology and immunology there in 2010. Ahmed currently serves as the Vaccine Center director, professor of microbiology and immunology, and AIDS research investigator at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Research Ahmed is known for his research on T cells, which he began studying during his postdoc. Specifically, at UCLA, Ahmed studied memory T cell differentiation and immunity of T and B cells against viruses, such as hepatitis C and HIV in a paper that gained him notoriety in the immunology world. In 1995, Ahmed moved to Emory University and began his work to secure funding to develop a vaccine center there. At Emory, Ahmed has worked to investigate t-cell exhaustion in fighting chronic infection, through which he discovered a link between t-cell exhaustion and expression of the gene PD1, or \\"Programmed Death 1.\\" With the help of Emory graduate student Daniel Barber, Ahmed devised a way to use antibodies to block this inhibitory receptor and enhance flagging T-cell function. Today, \\"PD1 Blockade Treatments\\" are being investigated for treating aggressive cancers with promising preliminary results. At the Ahmed Laboratory at Emory University, Rami Ahmed and his team work to build understanding on the development and maintenance of humoral memory. The lab has co-developed a novel method for rapidly generating human monoclonal antibodies after vaccination, and has shown that \\"broadly cross- reactive antibodies that recognize multiple influenza viruses can be generated after influenza vaccination in humans.\\" This research is reportedly paving the way for a possible future universal influenza vaccine.

It was officially designated as Kommandostab Reichsf√ºhrer-SS on 6 May. To head the organisation, Himmler appointed a career army officer who acted as chief of staff for the units. The purpose of the formation was to conduct ‚Äúpacification operations‚Äù in the Army Group Rear Areas and civilian-administered territories (Reichskommissariats). Prior to the launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the formations under the Kommandostab included two motorized SS Infantry Brigades (1st and 2nd) and two SS Cavalry Regiments combined into the SS Cavalry Brigade, totaling about 25,000 Waffen-SS troops.

Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1127th Rifle Regiment * 1129th Rifle Regiment * 1131st Rifle Regiment * 899th Artillery Regiment * 616th Sapper BattalionCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 82 Its first commander, Col. Sergei Mikhailovich Bushev, was appointed on the same day. In October, while still barely formed, the division was assigned to 57th Army, which was also just in the process of forming-up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command at Stalingrad. In January, 1942 the division went into combat with its Army in Southwestern Front, taking part in the Barvenkovo‚ÄìLozovaya Offensive which led to the creation of the Izium salient south of Kharkov. By the end of January, 1942, the 337th was reassigned to 6th Army, still in Southwestern Front, in the northeastern sector of the salient.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 82 =Second Battle of Kharkov= Maj. Gen. Ilia Vasilevich Vasilev took command of the division on February 26. When the Soviet offensive to liberate Kharkov began in May, the 337th was in a defensive deployment along a long sector on the right (southern) bank of the Northern Donets River, holding the north shoulder of the salient with the 47th Rifle Division to the west and the 304th to the east, facing the German 44th Infantry Division in its own salient based on Andreevka and Balakleia. Through the course of the offensive, and the German counter-offensive, which began on May 17, it maintained these positions, even as the situation deteriorated both to the south and the north. On May 22 the 1st Panzer Army in the division's rear linked up with the 44th Infantry to its front, and the 337th was encircled. On May 23 the 3rd Panzer Division, which had been freed up by the collapse of the Soviet offensive north of Kharkov, drove into its positions across the Donets, causing havoc.David M. Glantz, Kharkov 1942, Ian Allan Publishing, Ltd., Hersham, UK, 1998/2010, pp. 92, 267-68, 280, 282-83 On May 25, while directing breakout efforts, General Vasilev was severely wounded in the chest, and died later that day near the village of Kamenka.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, trans. & ed. by D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, p. 57 On the same date the division headquarters disintegrated and the division was officially disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 82 2nd Formation A new 337th Rifle Division was formed in the high summer of 1942, once again in the North Caucasus Military District. Its order of battle remained the same as that of the first formation, with the addition of the 889th Antitank Battalion.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 125 Col. G. M. Kochenov was appointed to command on August 13, but he would be replaced by Col. Nikolai Ivanovich Dementev on September 6. With German panzers driving towards the Prokhladnyi and Mozdok regions, on August 23 the STAVKA ordered the formation of a new 24th Army to defend the Makhachkala region. The 337th was assigned to this new Army, but on August 28 the order was countermanded, re-designating the new Army as the 58th.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 437 As German Army Group A continued its drive to capture the Caucasian oil fields, on September 29, Lt. Gen. I.I. Maslennikov, commander of the Transcausasus Front's Northern Group of Forces, received orders for defense of the region from the STAVKA, including the following:By October 23 the division was in 44th Army. It appeared to Maslennikov that, although the Germans had taken Mozdok and some territory to its south, they were a spent force and he was proposing a counterattack with a group that would include the 337th. In the event this was forestalled two days later when the \\"spent\\" Germans launched a renewed drive to the southwest and then to the east; this attack was halted at the gates of Ordzhonikidze on November 5, at which time the division was serving in 9th Army.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 559, 577, 580, 601-05 In January, 1943 the division was moved to the 47th Army in the Black Sea Group of Forces of the Transcaucasus Front, which became the North Caucasus Front the next month. On January 27, Colonel Dementev was promoted to Major General, but just five days later he was severely wounded; he would be hospitalized for five months and would never return to the front. He was first replaced by Col. S. F. Sklyarov for about a month until Col. Grigorii Osipovich Lyaskin was appointed to command of the division on March 8; on April 28 he was promoted to Major General. Also in April the combat path of the 337th veered sharply northwards as it and its Army were transferred to the Steppe Military District in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, backing up the Soviet forces deployed in the Kursk salient. Following the Battle of Kursk the division re-entered the fighting front in late July in the Voronezh Front to take part in the Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 125 As the offensive expanded into eastern Ukraine, on September 18, the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of Lubny as follows:In the same month Voronezh Front assigned the division to the 47th Rifle Corps of 40th Army, and in November the division, still in 47th Corps, joined the 27th Army in 1st Ukrainian Front (former Voronezh Front). On February 13, 1944, General Lyaskin handed his command to Col. Taras Pavlovich Gorobets, who would remain in that post for the duration. The 337th would remain in 27th Army for the duration of the war, moving to 2nd Ukrainian Front in March. From that month, and for most of the rest of the war, the division was in the 33rd Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 125 =First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= On February 26 the 337th was awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Class, in recognition of its successes in the Korsun-Shevchenovski Operation. On April 8 it was further honored for its role in forcing a crossing of the Dniestr River and the subsequent capture of the city of Beltsi with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. In Marshal I. S. Konev's plan for a breakthrough of the German-Romanian front west of Iasi in the second week of April, his 40th and 27th Armies were designated as his shock groups. In the event, while the division's corps-mates, 78th and 180th Rifle Divisions, made a strong but unsuccessful effort against 24th Panzer Division defending the town of Podu Iloaiei up to April 12, the 337th held a defensive line facing the Romanian 7th Infantry Division northwest of Iasi.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 52-54, 62, 69 Konev planned a new offensive later that month, which included a diversionary attack directly on Iasi. Early on April 24 several reinforced rifle battalions of the 337th were to conduct a reconnaissance-in-force along the road from Zahorna to Iasi. Regardless of the success of this reconnaissance, the remainder of 33rd Corps, with armor support, was to attack the Romanian 18th Infantry Division between Tautesti and Vinaturi early the next day. On the 26th, forces of the 52nd Army would join the attack, backed by additional tanks and the 337th in support, all in the aim of capturing the enemy's defenses at Vulturi, 6 km due north of Iasi. In the event, the reconnaissance made few gains, while the main attack managed to wedge up to 2‚Äì3 km into the Romanian defenses east of Tautesti before reinforcements from the German 79th and 46th Infantry, and 24th Panzer Divisions forced 33rd Corps back to its jumping-off positions by the end of April 28.Glantz, Red Storm, pp. 177-79 A further effort was scheduled to begin on May 2. An extensive regrouping moved 78th Rifle Division westwards to reinforce the 35th Guards Rifle Corps, while the remainder of 33rd Corps was make a supporting assault northwest of Iasi, beginning at 0615 hrs. This made no progress against stubborn resistance, for a loss of 24 men killed and 113 wounded. Konev's forces persisted in their attacks until May 7, but this produced nothing but casualties for the 337th. The front remained mostly quiet until near the end of the month.Glantz, Red Storm, pp. 188-89, 193-95, 234, 248 During this time Konev ordered a major regrouping of his forces to the sector north of Iasi, intending to make another effort against that city. However, on May 24 he was reassigned to command of the 1st Ukrainian Front; he was replaced by Gen. R. I. Malinovsky and the offensive was cancelled. German intelligence had noticed the regrouping, and their 8th Army made plans for a preemptive attack. This began on May 30 and took the Soviet forces by surprise. The 337th and 202nd Divisions of 33rd Corps were deployed defensively on an 8 km sector from Horlesti to Avantul, backed by forward elements of 16th Tank Corps about 5 km to the rear. The Axis forces attacking were from Grossdeutschland Panzer Grenadier and 24th Panzer Divisions, backed by the Romanian 3rd and 18th Divisions. The initial assault, Operation Sonja, hit 52nd Army to the east and continued until June 1, driving a deep wedge into its defenses. The next day the second phase, Operation Katja, was launched against 27th Army. By now, 206th Rifle Division had arrived from the west to support the rest of 33rd Corps. The attack hit the boundary between 33rd Corps and 52nd Army and collapsed the 337th's defenses around Horlesti, bypassing that town and moving towards Zahorna, which was held by the division's second echelon rifle regiment. Horlesti was soon captured, and the division fell back rapidly to the north. By midday the Soviet front was pierced in many places, and Grossdeutschland's fusilier regiment in particular had caused heavy casualties to the 337th. By mid-morning the 33rd Corps was described as \\"shattered\\", and on June 3 only \\"remnants\\" of the division were still in the fight. The arrival of the 27th Guards Rifle Corps, and especially the 409th Rifle Division, brought Katya to a halt by June 6.Glantz, Red Storm, pp. 330-31, 338-39, 345-47, 350-59 =Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= The division rebuilt at the front through the rest of June and July. The plan for the next Soviet offensive called for 27th Army to lead its attack with 104th and 35th Guards Rifle Corps with 33rd Corps in second echelon; the 337th's divisional artillery was to support 35th Guards Corps' assault. In the days leading up to the offensive the division had to change its front sectors twice, at night and under heavy security. The offensive opened on August 20, and the 337th entered the fighting the next day. The Corps' objective was the enemy defensive line along the Mare Ridge. During the morning the attack ran into resistance from remnants of Romanian 5th Infantry Division, a regiment of the German 46th Infantry Division, and Romanian 13th Infantry Division, supported by tanks. Counterattacks by these Axis forces were held off, and in the afternoon were crushed; despite this, 33rd Corps, which was tasked to take Mare Ridge, only reached its forward edge by the end of the day. This proved a temporary setback. On August 22 the 337th, taking advantage of the 5th Guards Tank Corps operating ahead of it, broke into the clear and advanced far to the south, reaching the Birlad River and crossing it near Todiresti.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. & trans.

He is surnamed Valet by Alberic of Trois-Fontaines. Family Geoffrey was the only son of Geoffrey III the Old and his wife, Felicity (F√©licit√©) of Brienne. His mother's first husband, Simon I of Broyes, died sometime before 1132 and Geoffrey was born to her second marriage before 1141. By 1179, he was assisting his elderly father in the government of Joinville. In Geoffrey III's last years, his son seems to have been exercising the lordship in his father's name. He succeeded to it only on his father's death in 1188. Sometime before his accession, Geoffrey married H√©luis (Helvide), a daughter of the crusader Guy I of Dampierre. They had six sons and two daughters, all listed by Alberic of Trois-Fontaines. The order of the sons is their birth order: *Geoffrey V le Trouillard (died c. 1204), succeeded as lord of Joinville, was an adult in 1188 *Robert, lord of Sailly by 1201, accompanied Walter III of Brienne on the Fourth Crusade, but died in Apulia en route to the Holy Land, in 1203; was succeeded in Sailly by his brother Simon *William (died 1226), archdeacon of Ch√¢lons (1191), bishop of Langres (1208) and archbishop of Reims (1219) *Simon (died 1233), succeeded as lord of Sailly in 1203 and as lord of Joinville in 1204 *Guy, became lord of Sailly after Simon inherited Joinville in 1204 *Andrew, who became a Knight Templar *Felicity (fl. 1195‚Äì1237), married Pierre de Bourl√©mont *Yolanda (died 1233), married Ralph, Count of Soissons Lordship The arms of the house of Broyes, which were also those of Joinville because of Geoffrey's mother While his father had been seneschal of the county of Champagne, an office later hereditary in the Joinville family, it is not clear if Geoffrey IV inherited this office. There is no record either in his own charters or those of the count of him as seneschal. In his first recorded act, in 1188, Geoffrey recognised the collegiate church of Saint-Laurent in Joinville as his family's particular chapel and renounced for himself and his descendants the right to construct a chapel in the castle of Joinville. This charter was witnessed by his wife and his children. The future Geoffrey V is identified as the (uterine) brother of Hugh III of Broyes. The close relationship between the Joinville and Broyes families explains the similarity of their coats of arms. In 1189, Geoffrey, with the consent of his two eldest sons, granted his vineyard at Mussey to the abbey of Saint-Urbain in return for mass being said for his father every year on the anniversary of his death. He also confirmed his father's donation for the founding of the priory of Saint-Jacques. At the same time, he granted the tithes of Charmes-en-l'Angle, to which he had right, to establish a prebend at Saint-Laurent for saying annual masses for himself and H√©luis and for two masters: Acelin, teacher of his son William, and a certain Constant. Later that year, Geoffrey settled a dispute between the men of Vaucouleurs, a castle town belonging to Joinville, and the abbey of Vaux en Ornois over a meadow. He also settled his own dispute with the priory of Notre-Dame of Val d'Osne by admitting he was in the wrong to set up a mill that put Notre-Dame's out of business. He paid generous compensation. Crusade and death The various religious acts undertaken in 1188 and 1189 were made in preparation for the Third Crusade, which Count Henry II of Champagne had vowed to join. According to Guy of Bazoches, a cleric from Champagne, Geoffrey was among those nobles of Champagne who, tired of Henry's delays, left on their own for the Holy Land. According to Ernoul, he joined the army of the French king, Philip Augustus. Geoffrey was accompanied on the crusade by his eldest son. He arrived during the siege of Acre, before the battle of 4 October 1189, when Andrew of Ramerupt, who had left Champagne with him, was killed. He died during the siege in August 1190, evidently of illness or a festering wound, since he had the time to settle his last disputes with the church. The month of his death is supplied by a 14th-century epitaph written by his grandson, John of Joinville, for his father, Geoffrey III, who was buried in the abbey of Clairvaux. As his last acts, Goffrey ceded some land at La Blaise to the abbey of Montier-en-Der, and a cottage at Land√©ville to Saint-Urbain. These acts record the leading members of the retinue he took with him: his chaplain Dreu and the knights Hugues de Landricourt, Raoul de Dommartin, Eudes de Vaucouleurs, √âtienne de la C√¥te and Hugues de Colombey, all of whom held fiefs of Joinville. During Geoffrey's absence, his lordship was governed by H√©luis. She was still living in 1195.

As one of the first comedians in this genre, she often discusses the intersection of queer and Latina identities that develop a liminal identity for people who are marginalized for more than one aspect of their existence. Her work is known for being unapologetically queer, despite the homophobia that had permeated Latinx communities since long before she began performing. Palacios acknowledges that she often takes uncomfortable topics and makes them more palatable to herself and her audiences with physical comedy, but not without challenges and some pushback. She continues to produce works like The OH! Show, where discussion of sex is intentionally ubiquitous. This is evident in the forward of the play, in which she declares, \\"...we are sexual beings until we die, or until your partner removes the vibrator from your hands‚Äîwhichever comes first.\\"Palacios, M. (Writer). (2007). The OH! Show: Old and Horny. In her performances, Palacios restructures white and heteronormative narratives by using several modes of storytelling. One way by which she does this is adapting popular, and heterosexual, songs to include queer people in the narratives and uproot their heteronormativity. For example, she ends her show Queer Chicano Soul: Thirty Years of Fierce Performance, My Quincea√±era Times Two, with a series of song snippets titled the \\"Vagina Medley.\\" All lyrics were changed to accommodate the addition of the word, such as \\"I left my vagina in San Francisco,\\" in which \\"vagina\\" replaces \\"heart\\" in Tony Bennett's I Left My Heart in San Francisco. This performance is made up of a variety of segments of autobiographical narratives, vignettes, segments of standup and mime. This format is reminiscent of traditional carpas that traveled to working-class Latinx people to engage them in theatre and political discourse (like Luis Valdez's El Teatro Campesino). Thus, the backdrop of Los Angeles, a city claimed to be of \\"Chicanos and Mexicanos\\" that Palacios has called \\"complex and brilliant inspiration\\" for her art, provides a place where she can teach and perform for diverse audiences. Like Queer Chicano Soul, the majority of her shows are grounded in her identity as a Chicana woman, as they switch between English and Spanish and have cultural references throughout. Palacios also draws inspiration from Latinx writers Jorge Huerta, Irene Fornes, Migdalia Cruz, Marga Gomez, and several others.  Activism  From 1992‚Äì2000, Palacios was the director of VIVA, Lesbian and Gay Latino Artists of Los Angeles. She organized cultural events in Los Angeles County which combined art and activism. The goal of these events was to inspire and promote queer, Latino artists in her community, and the majority of her works are developed to empower them. Palacios has won awards for her contributions to the queer and Latinx communities. She is a co-founding member of Culture Clash, whose satirical sketches, plays, and screenplays all feature race-based, political, and social commentary. In 2016, Palacios performed her short play Say Their Names in the international theatre effort \\"After Orlando\\" in response to the Orlando nightclub shooting. That same year, she did a presentation about her career titled \\"Queer Chicana Lesbian Activism Through Theatre & Comedy\\" at the University of New Mexico. In 2014, she was a panelist at a World AIDs day panel called \\"Queer Latinidad: Histories of AIDS Consciousness from Los Angeles\\" at Pitzer College. Palacios does much of her activist work in universities. For example, she performed during Gay and Lesbian awareness month at UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, and MIT in 1994. Palacios helped develop and has her own blog on epochalips.com, an online platform where lesbians and allies can discuss similar experiences and find community in these shared moments.  Written Works  In over three decades, Palacios has written numerous plays, standup sets, poems, and articles. She began her solo work in 1982 and has dozens of performances. = One Woman Shows (Select) = * 2002: Queer Soul - 20 year retrospective * 2002: Obvious * 2002: Besame Mucho * 2006: Get Your Feet Wet * 2007: The OH!

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. It was the only annular eclipse which took place that year. It was part of solar saros 121. Description The eclipse took place in much of the southeast part of the Indian Ocean and included some of the islands and all of Antarctica (many areas had a 24-hour daylight at the time) except for the South Orkney Islands, it also included most of the south of Western Australia, a part of the southwesternmost state of Victoria and much of Tasmania except for the northeasternmost part, most of New Zealand's South Island, particularly the southern part and a part of the southern portion of the Pacific Ocean. The rim of the eclipse included the area hundreds of miles (or kilometers) from Cocos Islands and the southernmost of South America, it also included the southernmost portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The umbral portion crossed the middle of Antarctica which was close to the South Pole and the south part of the middle of the continent's peninsula, it lasted over a minute. The eclipse began at sunrise thousands of miles (or kilometers) offshore from Africa and west of Australia and ended at sunset at Patagonia and thousands of kilometers offshore from Chile and Peru. The greatest eclipse was in the Antarctic Peninsula north of the South Pole at 86.6 S and 121.5 E at 0:57 UTC (8:57 AM local time). It was around 65% obscured in Antarctica where the Indian and the Pacific Oceans separates. As the moon moved towards the left on Earth in Australia and New Zealand, at the other side of Northern Antarctica that includes the 70th meridian, it was seen as it was moved towards the bottom right, in areas within the Prime Meridian, it moved right, at the peninsula, it then moved top right as the axis spun at around the 68th parallel south.

The first company was formed on January 25, 1871, and existed for just five days before merging with a much larger road (itself the product of the merger with three other railroads). On January 20, 1873, two other railroads merged with the MV&W; to create a second consolidated company. This last railroad went bankrupt on August 7, 1874, having constructed only a minimal amount of track. The bankrupt firm was sold to the St. Louis, Keokuk and North Western Railway. History =Missouri railroad predecessors= On February 27, 1851, the state of Missouri issued a charter to the Canton and Bloomfield Railroad to build a rail line from Canton, Missouri, to Bloomfield, Iowa. There is no indication that any equipment was purchased. However, the company did partially grade about of bed from Canton to the west. On February 17, 1857, the state of Missouri issued a charter to the Mississippi and Missouri River Air Line Railroad, giving that railroad extensive privileges to build a rail line from the Mississippi to Missouri river in 10 northern counties of Missouri. The Canton and Bloomfield Railroad was sold to the Mississippi and Missouri River Air Line on June 25, 1860. The Air Line completed about of track between April and June 1861. But work ceased when the United States government seized the railroad's equipment as part of the American Civil War effort. In 1868, the company obtained more right of way to the west, and in 1869 graded a track bed to Glenwood, Missouri. The company also acquired a right of way from Canton to West Quincy in 1868, and by early 1870 had graded this as well. but no track was laid on either bed. On February 18, 1865, the state of Missouri issued a charter to the Alexandria, Canton, La Grange and West Quincy Railroad, to build a line from Alexandria, Missouri, south through Canton and La Grange to West Quincy, Missouri. Although the company conducted surveys of its route, no other construction work was done. On April 1, 1870, this railroad merged with the Mississippi and Missouri River Air Line (effective April 8, 1870) to form the similarly named Mississippi and Missouri River Air-Line Railroad. The company contracted with the Missouri Railway Construction Company, which built of standard gauge, single-line track from West Quincy to Canton. The Air-Line turned over nearly all of its bonds to the construction company in order to pay for this construction. =The first and second Mississippi Valley and Western Railways= On January 25, 1871, the Mississippi Valley and Western Railway was incorporated in the state of Iowa, with headquarters at Canton, Missouri. The charter permitted the railroad to build a line from Keokuk, Iowa, to the Iowa-Missouri border. The southern terminus of the line had to be within of Alexandria, Missouri. There is no indication that it had any assets other than its charter. Five days later, the MV&W; was merged with the Mississippi and Missouri River Air-Line Railroad to form a new MV&W.; This gave the consolidated railroad access to markets in both Missouri and Iowa. The merged firm was incorporated on March 10, 1871, and completed just under of standard gauge, single-line track from Canton to Buena Vista, Iowa, by the end of 1872. =Third Mississippi Valley and Western Railway= Meanwhile, on January 15, 1870, the state of Missouri chartered the Clarksville and Western Railroad. It had the authority to build a rail line from Clarksville, Missouri, west to Bowling Green, Missouri, where it would meet with the Louisiana and Missouri River Railroad (whose line ran from Bowling Green to Louisiana, Missouri). The company obtained about of right of way between St. Peters, Missouri, and Mud Lick Prairie (a site a few miles north of Louisiana, Missouri). By the end of 1872, it had graded some of this bed, and built or partially built several bridges on the line. The state of Missouri next chartered the Mississippi Valley Railroad on May 24, 1871, giving it authority to run a line from Hannibal, Missouri, to Moody, Missouri. On August 8, 1872, the directors of the railroad declared their intention to continue the line from Hannibal south to Clarksville in order to connect with the Clarksville and Western. Little actual work was done, however. The company only completed a preliminary survey of its route, and obtained only a limited (and indeterminate) amount of right of way by late 1872. On January 20, 1873, the Clarksville & Western and the Mississippi Valley consolidated with the MV&W; to form a third company, also known as the MV&W.; By 1874, the firm had constructed of track from West Quincy to Hannibal. Its total completed track was just . Potentially, the railroad had the right to construct a main and branch line from Quincy through Keokuk to Brownville, Nebraska. Default and sale Ohio railroad executive and investor Amasa Stone invested in the MV&W; when it formed on January 20, 1873. The MV&W; defaulted on its bonds, and on August 7, 1874, was turned over to a receiver‚Äîwhich turned out to be Amasa Stone. Stone put the railroad up for sale, and it was sold to his brother, Andros Stone, on April 14, 1875. Six days later, Andros Stone sold the railroad to the St. Louis, Keokuk and North Western Railway (SLK&NW;), which had been formed by Andros Stone and others to acquire the assets of the bankrupt line. The sale closed June 22, 1875. Andros Stone received $165,000 ($ in dollars) in cash, $600,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds (with a maturity due in two years at 7 percent interest), and $471,800 ($ in dollars) in common and preferred stock. Court decisions The bankruptcy of the MV&W; lead to two important legal cases. In Mississippi Valley and Western Railway Co. v. United States Express Co., a fast-freight firm, the United States Express Co., sued the railroad and its trustees seeking payment for services rendered. With the railroad bankrupt, it sought to reclaim these funds from the railroad's bondholders‚Äîwho had received payment in the railroad's final months (while U.S. Express went unpaid). But the Supreme Court of Illinois denied the claim, noting that a lender was entitled to payment until a receiver was appointed. A receiver had no authority to seize payments made to the lender prior to the declaration of insolvency. A second case, Barney v. Keokuk, was decided the same year by the Supreme Court of the United States. The city of Keokuk had filled in about of the Mississippi River with stone and dirt. Several railroads, including the Mississippi Valley and Western Railway Company, laid track on this \\"reclaimed land\\". A local landowner, shut off from the river by this construction, sued, demanding removal of the railroad tracks, wharves, and warehouse erected between his land and the river. The Supreme Court noted that the public held title to the soil below the high-water mark on a river. Under the peculiarities of Iowa law, a city had the right to erect a street on reclaimed land erected on this publicly held riverbed. Iowa law gave railroads the right to run on the streets, and thus the tracks were permissible.

Air pollution in Taiwan is mostly derived from sources of domestic combustion, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. https://international.thenewslens.com/article/90010 Taiwan's topography has been noted to be a contributing factor to its air pollution problem, leading to poor dispersal and trapping pollutants. Taipei, Taiwan's capital and largest city for example, is surrounded by mountains, and other industrial centers along the northern and western coasts of Taiwan are surrounded by high mountains. Types of pollutants =PM10= In March 2014, Taiwanese legislators and the Taiwan Healthy Air Action Alliance claimed, based on reports by the World Health Organization, that the air quality in Taiwan is generally the worst of all of the Four Asian Tigers, in particularly drawing attention to the annual mean PM10 level of Taiwan (54 micrograms per cubic meter). The annual mean PM10 level of the country's capital Taipei (47.1 micrograms per cubic meter) made the city rank only 1,089 among 1,600 included cities around the world. Based on 2004 data by Taiwan's Department of Environmental Protection, the annual mean PM10 level for Taiwan had, for the last decade, been worse than the European Union limit value (40 micrograms per cubic meter) every year. Fugitive dust Nantou earthquake of 2 June 2013. Satellite imagery of 9 August 2009 showing typhoon Morakot over Taiwan. Southern Taiwan is reported to have recorded a record of rain, causing flooding and landslides. During examinations of the 2013‚Äî2014 winter by the Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA) Department of Environmental Monitoring and Information Management, it was reported that stations in Yunlin, Chiayi and Greater Tainan often had the worst pollution concentrations. According to the EPA Department's Deputy Director Chang Shuenn-chin (ÂºµÈ†ÜÊ¨Ω) this is caused by fugitive dust at riverbanks during the low-flow season of winter. These particles ‚Äî suspended in the air by wind action and human activities ‚Äî can be stirred up by the strong northeastern winds occurring in winter, also known as the northeastern monsoon. As such, wind speeds exceeding three meters per second are likely to cause gusts of fugitive dust with PM10 concentration levels above 250Œºg/m3. High maximum readings in PM10 concentration levels in Yunlin County's Lunbei Township (Â¥ôËÉå) in 2015 (2,532Œºg/m3) and in Chiayi County's Puzih City (Êú¥Â≠ê) in 2009 (1,793Œºg/m3) and; in 2013; in Puzih (497Œºg/m3) and in Lunbei (497Œºg/m3) are claimed to be heavily influenced by heavy rainfall and mudslides during Typhoon Morakot in 2009 as well as by the 6.2 Mw June 2013 Nantou earthquake. Earthquakes may shake up loose soil on upstream slope areas, later washed downstream by torrential rains during the summer. This increases the likelihood for land collapse and mud slides, which in turn creates dust on riverbanks. =PM2.5= With regards to research conducted on PM2.5 particles in Taiwan, the National Taiwan University in March 2015 claimed that traffic is the major source of air pollutants in Taipei, while fine particles are produced primarily by thermal power plants in Central Taiwan. While presenting this research, the National Taiwan University communicated that the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 particles in Taipei City and New Taipei City is 20 ¬µg/m3, while being 30 ¬µg/m3 in Kaohsiung. Further more, in greater Taipei, the outdoor PM2.5 concentration in the air at ground-level up until the height of three-stories is around ten to twenty times higher than the concentration in the air at the height of four-story buildings and above. Levels of other hazardous suspended particles such as silicon and iron were equally found to be significantly lower when increasing altitude. Professor Chang-Fu Wu (Âê≥Á´†Áî´) of the same university attributed this to dust and traffic pollution. The normative limit value of PM2.5 in Taiwan is set at 15 ¬µg/m3, which is no longer the same standard as that of the United States, having revised its standard to 12 ¬µg/m3 in 2013. The WHO suggested maximum exposure limit is lower still at 10 ¬µg/m3. By November 2015, it was claimed that the EPA's PM2.5 Index indicated poor air qualities for almost one-third of Taiwan's cities for more than one hundred days that year, with Nantou topping the list at 147 such days. On November 8, central Taiwan, along with the Yunlin and Chiayi regions, reached the hazardous purple alert. AQI-index for Zuoying District (156, unhealthy) in the southern city of Kaohsiung, as well as a colour-index for other measuring stations across Taiwan on 14 November 2017 at noon. Based on data from 2016, the Environmental group Air Clean Taiwan claimed in 2017 that Kaohsiung's Zuoying District, Yunlin's Lunbei Township and Pingtung were amongst the worst affected city (districts) in the country, with Lunbei topping the list regarding high levels of PM2.5, often prompting the red and purple alerts issued by the EPA. =NO2= Based on 2004 data by Taiwan's Department of Environmental Protection, for the last decade, the average annual mean concentration of NO2 in Taiwan had equally surpassed the European Union limit value (40 micrograms per cubic meter) every consecutive year. Sources of pollution =Cross-border pollution from China= MODIS imagery, captured by NASA's Terra satellite on 7 January 2002, showing most of south-eastern China being covered in a thick greyish shroud of aerosol pollution (a phenomenon which had been ongoing for several weeks). The smog extends eastwards, blanketing Taiwan. SeaWiFS imagery of 15 February 2004 showing a continuing haze of air pollution concentrated over eastern China and blowing over eastwards to areas such as Taiwan. In February 2014, the Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA) Department of Environmental Monitoring and Information Management Director Chu Yu-chi (Êú±Èõ®ÂÖ∂) claimed there had been seven haze and dust storms since December 2013. Mr. Chu also reported that, for the largest part based on recent weather phenomena and air pollutant monitoring data from China's major cities, China's air pollution generally deteriorates the air quality in Taiwan significantly every winter. The EPA concluded that air pollutants brought in from China by strong winds was directly responsible for drastically rising the detected concentration levels of particles under 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) at close to all of Taiwan's seventy-six monitoring stations. During the periods of cross-border haze, referring to pollution blown over from China, the pollution standards index (PSI) readings ‚Äî which are based on the highest concentration value of five major air pollutants PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ground-level ozone ‚Äî at most stations reached unhealthy levels, while some stations in central and southern Taiwan even reached hazardous levels. During those winter months, short-term health hazards due to the northeastern winds included mild symptoms of eye irritation, sneezing or coughing. Epidemiological statistics also show that the short-term increase of air pollutant levels during the winter coincide with sudden spikes in hospitalization for cerebrovascular disease. With regards to spikes in PM10 particles concentration during periods of strong winds in the winter, fugitive dust and phenomena such as earthquakes, typhoons and other domestic geographical or meteorological factors must be taken into account. =Domestically produced pollution= Industry Some buildings of the heavily polluting Sixth Naphtha Cracker Plant of the Formosa Plastics Group Mail-Liao Industrial Complex in northwestern Yunlin County, Taiwan, on 15 March 2014. During warnings by the scientific community about increasing prevalence of lung cancer in Taiwan in December 2015, it was claimed that Taichung Power Plant, along with the Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant of the Formosa Plastics Group account for roughly seventy percent of the air pollution in the Central Taiwan region of the country, emitting large quantities of sulfur oxides. Scooters Many people travelling by scooters in Taipei, reportedly going home after the New Year's Eve celebrations of 31 December 2006/1 January 2007. In a 1996 article, it was claimed that there were 8.8 million motorcycles and 4.8 million cars on Taiwan's roads, with motorcycles being called the primary means of transport for the majority of the island's adult population. Motorcycles with two-stroke engines were claimed to be the biggest single source of vehicular pollution in Taiwan, while also being the majority of the motorcycles operating in Taiwan. You Yii-der of the Environmental Protection Foundation and Jay Fang of the Green Consumer Foundation were noted to propagate that all motorcycles powered by two-stroke engines should be banned. Religious rituals In 2014 a study by Academia Sinica's Research Center for Environmental Changes claimed that, due to the burning of ghost money (also known as Joss paper) and incense during religious ceremony days (occurring mostly on the first and 15th days of the lunar calendar month), values of PM10 particles at large temples are at five to sixteen times the normal value of a regular household's environment. Equally, due to the burning of ghost money and incense, the households of communities with a nearby temple show an increase in PM2.5 particles value at an average of 15.1 micrograms per cubic meter. Monitoring =Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network (TAQMN)= When the domestic Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA) Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network (TAQMN) was established in 1990, it entailed nineteen air quality monitoring stations, having increased to sixty-six in 1993 and to seventy-two in 1998. In 2003, the pollutants which it monitored included NO2, CO, PM, O3, SO2 and HCs. In November 2015, the Conservation Mothers Foundation criticized the EPA, arguing that it was urging people to stay at home during periods of bad air quality, when they should rather be \\"inspecting and fining the major parties responsible for air pollution\\".

To contrast between a negative and a positive result, PBA is linked to a colorimetric method, thereby resulting in a change in color when a targeted analyte is detected, i.e., a positive signal. PBA is also used to quantify the concentration of the analyte by measuring intensity of the color.  Method  Figure 1. Schematic description of Photopolymerization-based signal amplification PBA is achieved by sequentially adding three kinds of solutions to a test strip and illuminating it with green light. First, a droplet of a patient‚Äôs sample is loaded on a test strip whose surface is covered with immobilized antibodies. If the sample contains the target antigens, they bind to the immobilized antibodies. (Figure 1a) Second, eosin-conjugated antibodies are added to the patient‚Äôs sample. This second antibody specifically binds with the bound antigens, thereby causing each bound antigen to be sandwiched between the first and eosin-conjugated antibodies. (Figure 1b) After ten minutes, the droplet on the surface is rinsed away in order to make sure that only the sandwiched binding complexes are left on the surface before adding the third solution. Lastly, a droplet of mixture of monomers (e.g., PEGDA and N-vinyl pyrrolidone) and phenolphthalein is added to the test strip, and the droplet is illuminated with green visible light, by which the eosin molecules become excited and produce radicals. (Figure 1c) As a result, propagation is caused and polymers are formed. Since phenolphthalein molecules are surrounded by the polymers and thus left on the surface even after another rinse, the test strip turns red when a base is added. (Figure 1d) On the other hand, if the patient‚Äôs sample does not include any targeted antigens, the sandwiched binding complexes on the surface will not be formed, which leads to no red color.  Principle  = Regeneration of Eosin = Many radical polymerizations, including ATRP and RAFT, cannot occur in an ambient environment because dissolved oxygen molecules can rapidly react with active radical species and form less active peroxyl radicals, thus inhibiting the radical polymerizations. Eosin-sensitized photopolymerization, on the other hand, can overcome this inhibition by dissolved oxygen with only sub- micromolar concentrations of free eosin in a PBA system, which allows radical polymerization even in an ambient environment. A great number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this special ability of eosin, but the most recent focuses on the regeneration of eosin with the production of superoxide. Figure 2. Proposed Mechanism for Regeneration of Eosin As can be seen in Figure 2, Liang et al. proposed that eosin radicals (Eosin Y\\\\cdot^- ) react with oxygen, regenerating Eosin Y. In this mechanism, when the ground state of eosin (Eosin Y) absorbs visible light, the eosin becomes excited (Eosin Y*). Then, it is reduced‚Äîgiven one electron‚Äîthrough a reaction with a tertiary amine while generating the amine radical and the eosin radical. This eosin radical is oxidized by the reaction with oxygen, so Eosin Y can be regenerated. The regeneration of eosin makes the PBA efficient because oxygen is consumed through this photocatalytic cycle of Eosin Y, so polymerization can take place in an ambient environment even if there is only a few micromolar concentration of Eosin Y. Eosin Y is not the only molecule with significant resilience to inhibition of oxygen, and methylene blue can also initiate photopolymerization in the presence of oxygen as Padon reported. However, Eosin Y has been regarded as the best photoinitiator due to its long excitation lifetime and low fluorescence quantum yield (Œ¶), which allows it to react with tertiary amine and generate radicals much faster than other alternatives. = Quantification = Quantification with PBA can be achieved by measuring intensity of the red color from phenolphthalein because brighter red emerges when the sample contains higher concentration of target antigens. For instance, if more antigens are bound to the surface antibodies, more eosin-conjugated antibodies will also bind to the bound analytes. Thus, photopolymerization on the surface becomes much faster and forms a thicker hydrogel film in which phenolphthalein molecules are trapped. Since more phenolphthalein molecules can remain in the thicker film after further rinsing, the indicators can give a higher intensity of red.  Other approaches  Many other polymerization methods have been implemented as a signal amplification tool: ATRP (atom-transfer radical polymerization), RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization), and enzyme- mediated redox polymerization. However, many of them are not available in ambient systems because they are susceptible to inhibition by oxygen. In order to solve inhibition in ambient systems, air-tolerant ATRP-based signal amplification has been developed. This method provides better sensitivity (~0.2 pmol) than eosin-sensitized PBA (1~10 nmol), but the air-tolerant ATRP takes much more time (~1 hour) to obtain the high sensitivity than the PBA (~100 seconds).

Eumelos was the brother of Satyros II (not to be confused with his great-grandfather, Satyrus I, another Bosporan ruler) and Prytanis. He and his brothers engaged in a conflict for the throne, which was rightfully inherited by Satyros, the eldest of them, from his father. Civil war Shortly after his brother became ruler, Eumelos became a pretender to the throne with the backing of Aripharnes, a ruler of the Sarmatian tribe of Siraces from whom he solicited aid. When Satyros learned of this, he immediately went after Eumelos with his army and crossed the river Thatis to wage war on his brother. Shortly after this, the Battle of the River Thatis occurred and resulted in a defeat for Eumelos. He and Aripharnes were forced to retreat to Siracena. Satyrus and his army followed his brother to the city, but could not take it as it was surrounded by the River Thatis, leaving two heavily guarded entrances as the only means of ingress. After a four-day siege, Satyrus died while fighting against Aripharnes at the main entryway. Meniscus, Satyros' mercenary captain, took Satyros' body back to Panticapaeum for a royal burial and ended the siege. Prytanis, the younger brother, assumed the title of ruler and continued Satyros' war against Eumelos. Eumelos appealed to his brother to split the kingdom between them, but Prytanis rejected the proposal, marching against his brother. The two fought a battle which Eumelos won near the Maeotic Lake. Prytanis was spared by his brother but soon he again waged war against Eumelos and was killed. Reuniting the kingdom and expansion To fully establish himself, Eumelos had the families and friends of his brothers killed. The citizens of Panticapaeum were displeased at the killing of their friends, so Eumelos gathered them to an open assembly in which he defended himself and also offered immunity from taxes for those that lived in the city. He enacted several reforms, as well as the recruitment of more Greeks into the Bosporan military, who had previously only provided a small number of its forces, the rest being Sarmatians. He also reinforced the Bosporan fleet, to deal with the pirates and strengthen their trade routes. Eumelos then proceeded to show kindness to other Greek cities that were in the Black Sea and gave refuge to 1,000 refugees from the city of Callantia who were driven out by Lysimachus. Eumelos led a series of campaigns against pirates in the eastern regions of the Black Sea‚Äîmost likely the Tauri, the Heniochi and several others‚Äîand was able to destroy them. He also took back the settlement of Tanais, which was abandoned due to continuous sieges from local tribes and made his kingdom large enough to rival that of Lysimachus. Death As he hurried his way back from Sindia to his palace in a four-horse wheeled carriage for a sacrifice, the horses became scared. The driver was unable to control them, so Eumelos jumped out of the carriage, but his sword became caught on the wheel and he was dragged along by the carriage and died. He was succeeded by his son Spartokos III.

Ghiorso (born October 21, 1954) is an American geochemist who resides in Seattle, Washington. He is best known for creating MELTS, a software tool for thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria in magmatic systems. Education Ghiorso earned an AB, MS, and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. He chose Berkeley for practical reasons: \\"I went to Berkeley because it was the local school, because tuition was essentially free, and because I was fascinated as a high school student with hot springs, volcanos, and, in particular, the work of Howell Williams and Arthur L. Day.\\" Career In 1980, Ghiorso was hired by the University of Washington (UW) as assistant professor in the Department of Geological Sciences. He was promoted to associate professor (a tenured position) three years later and to full professor in 1986. He served as department chair from 1994 to 1999. In 2003, he was hired by the University of Chicago. Leaving the UW was a difficult decision, as Ghiorso is a great believer in public education. He cited serious concerns about the UW administration as a primary reason for departing. In 2005 he decided to leave academia and dedicate himself full-time to research. He returned to Seattle and, with his colleague Richard Sack, founded the small non-profit research company OFM Research, where he is Vice President and Senior Research Scientist. He also holds affiliate faculty appointments at the University of Washington and Vanderbilt University. Ghiorso has also served as Associate Editor for the following scientific journals: American Journal of Science (1990-present); American Mineralogist (1990-1993); Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (1991-1993); and Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology (2015-present), Scientific contributions As an undergraduate, Ghiorso wrote an honors thesis on the hot springs in the Devil's Kitchen area of Lassen Volcanic Park. This work was never published. During his graduate work he continued to do experimental work related to acid sulfate hot springs until he became interested in attempts by Ian Carmichael to create a model for solutions in silicate liquids that could be used as a geothermometer for igneous rocks. =Background= In igneous petrology, geologists attempt to learn more about volcanic systems through the record in igneous rocks. Most magma is generated in the mantle through a process called decompression melting. As material rises and the pressure decreases, solidus declines until part of the mantle can melt. At or near the surface, the magma cools and crystallizes. Depending on the conditions, it may have time to cool uniformly, or fractional crystallization can occur if parts of the magma are removed after they crystallize. Bowen's reaction series An early model for fractional crystallization, which explained why certain types of mineral tend to be found together in igneous rocks, was Bowen's reaction series, formulated in 1922. Bowen found that, as magma crystallizes, it separates into two series: a continuous series of minerals that continuously adjusts their composition through interactions with the melt, and a discontinuous series of minerals that remain fixed in composition as they cool. Thus, the type of mineral indicates the temperature at which it was formed. Until the 1960s, interpretation of the igneous rock record was largely qualitative. Ian Carmichael wanted to determine quantitative information such as the temperature and pressure of the magma when crystals were formed as well as dissolved water and oxygen content. For this, thermodynamic models were needed. Although attempts to apply rigorous thermodynamics to igneous processes go back to at least 1949, they were hindered by a lack of experimental data. Using tools such as a drop calorimeter and wet chemistry, Carmichael and colleagues set out to systematically explore thermodynamic properties of magma at high temperatures. =Thermodynamic models= Ghiorso began working with Carmichael on silicate-liquid models in 1978, and in 1980 they published their first geothermometers. Carmichael hired Richard Sack in 1980, and Sack began extensive experiments that went into a more sophisticated model that was published in 1983, when Ghiorso was at the University of Washington. Ghiorso wrote a program in FORTRAN 77 that he distributed to other researchers. Ghiorso and Sack realized, however, that the model needed to become more sophisticated. At first, NSF program managers were skeptical of this computational approach, and Ghiorso had three NSF proposals turned down. Fortunately, he managed to persuade the Digital Equipment Corporation to fund his work. After a decade of publishing thermodynamic data on minerals such as olivine and feldspar, Ghiorso and Sack presented their new model, now called MELTS. Their 1995 publication in Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology became the journal's most cited paper, with more than 2,100 citations as of early 2017. After the publication of MELTS, Ghiorso continued to improve and extend it with the help of colleagues such as Mark Hirschmann, Paul Asimow, Pete Reiners and Victor Kress. After they identified some fundamental problems with the theory at high pressure, they developed pMELTS, a model for high pressures (1-3 gigapascals (GPa)), and published it in 2001. Asimow and co- authors published phMELTS, a model for mid-ocean ridge basalts that incorporated the effect of water content. In 1998, Ghiorso, Hirschmann and Tim Grove established the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR), an online database for experimental results on solid-melt equilibria. With Guilherme (Guil) Gualda, he modified MELTS to work better with rhyolite, a silicate-rich series of rocks, and released rhyolite-MELTS. Ghiorso is the lead investigator on an NSF collaborative research grant to develop ENKI (Enabling Knowledge Integration), a Web-based model-configuration and testing portal for computational thermodynamics and fluid dynamics. He is the lead PI on the project. With Dmitri Sverjensky of Johns Hopkins University, Ghiorso is leading a Deep Carbon Observatory project to integrate MELTS with the Deep Earth Water Model (DEW) created by Sverjensky. The DEW program models water- rock interactions to depths of 200 km. The movement of carbon between silicate melts and aqueous fluids is still poorly understood. Awards In 1984, while Ghiorso was at the University of Washington, he received a Presidential Young Investigator Award, a research grant for an amount of $245,918, from the National Science Foundation. For a paper published in Computers & Geosciences, he received the Best Paper Award from its publisher, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences. He was elected Fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America in 1993, the Geological Society of America in 1997, and the American Geophysical Union in 1999. The Mineralogical Society of America made him a Distinguished Lecturer for 1996-1997, elected him Councilor for 1997-2001, and awarded him the Dana Medal in 2003. He received the Bunsen Medal from the European Geosciences Union in 2010 and the Norman L. Bowen Award from the VGP Section of the American Geophysical Union in 2014.

She was the first American woman to be invited to address the World's Congress of Jurisprudence and Law Reform, where she delivered an address upon \\"Married Women's Property Acts in the United States, and Needed Reforms Therein.\\" She was also the first woman to publish in the American Law Review (1890), and the first woman to argue a case before the Rhode Island Supreme Court (1907). Greene's principal literary works were articles on legal subjects, for magazines and papers, such as \\"The Chautauquan\\" and \\"The American Law Review\\". Early years and education Mary Anne Greene was born in Warwick, Rhode Island, June 14, 1857, the daughter of John Waterman Aborn Greene and Mary Frances (Low) Greene. She was a lineal descendant of Roger Williams, and was of the ninth generation of the Rhode Island family founded by Dr. John Greene, son of Richard Greene, of Bowridge Hill, Gillingham, Dorset, England. John Greene came to Salem, Massachusetts from Salisbury, England, 1635, was one of the original proprietors of Providence, Rhode Island, 1636, and one of the original purchasers and founders of the town of Warwick, in 1642. This family gave to the colony and State a number of public officials, among them a Deputy Governor, John Greene, Jr.; a Chief Justice, who sat on the bench of the Court of Common Pleas of Kent County, Rhode Island all through the American Revolution; Philip Greene, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island; two colonial Governors, William and William, Jr.; and two Revolutionary officers of distinction, General Nathanael Greene and Colonel Christopher Greene, associated with the Battle of Red Bank, was a cousin of General Nathanael Greene. Greene began the study of law in 1885, in order to be able to manage her own business affairs and to assist other women to do the same. She took the full course of three years in the Boston University School of Law, graduating in 1888 with the degree of Bachelor of Laws, magna cum laude, being the third woman to graduate from the school, and the second to be admitted to the Massachusetts bar. Career =Lawyer= Being at once admitted to the Suffolk bar, in Boston, Greene became the second woman member of the Massachusetts bar. After practicing 18 months in Boston, she returned to Rhode Island in 1890, residing in Providence, where she was engaged in writing and lecturing on legal topics. Although she was successful in court practice, her physical frailty left her unable to endure its strain. For that reason, she never applied for admission to the Rhode Island bar, her standing at the Boston bar being sufficient for the kind of work she wanted to do. She engaged in an office practice, focusing largely on conveyancing and the care of estates. =Writer= In 1892, at the request of the Board of Managers of the Columbian Exposition, Greene compiled a pamphlet entitled \\"Legal Status of Women under the Laws of Rhode Island, 1892.\\" It was originally published in 1893, in Providence in the Rhode Island Woman's Directory for the Columbian Year, edited by Charlotte Field Dailey, for the Rhode Island Woman's World's Fair Advisory Board, of which Greene was a member. In 1900, the laws having been altered and amended, she revised the pamphlet, and it was published by the Rhode Island State Federation of Women's Clubs under the title, \\"Legal Status of Women in Rhode Island, 1900,\\" with a preface concerning the sweeping legislation for the benefit of Rhode Island wives. Greene was the first woman contributor to the American Law Review. Some of her published articles were: \\"Privileged Communications in suits between Husband and Wife,\\" American Law Review, September‚ÄìOctober, 1890; \\"The Evolution of the American Fee Simple,\\" American Law Review, March‚ÄìApril, 1897; \\"Results of the Woman Suffrage Movement,\\" Forum, June, 1894; and a series of articles on law for women in The Chautauquan, November, 1891-August, 1892. Greene assisted in preparing the fifth edition of James Schouler's Domestic Relations, the standard authority in the courts upon that branch of law. Greene's address at the World's Congress of Jurisprudence upon \\"Married Woman's Property Acts in the United States, and Needed Reforms therein,\\" was published in the Chicago Legal News of August 12; 1893. Her address delivered, in the Woman's Building of the Columbian Exposition, entitled \\"Legal Condition of Women in 1492 and 1892,\\" was printed in full in the official volumes of the Congresses in the Woman's Building. In the New England Magazine for 1898, her illustrated article on General Nathanael Greene appeared as a brief biography tracing the development of General Greene's character and attempting to show what it was that made him a military genius. The Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society published two small pamphlets written by Greene: \\"The Primer of Missions\\" in 1896 and \\"Women's Missionary Wills and Bonds\\" in 1902. Greene said, \\"If I get interested in any subject, legal, patriotic, or missionary, I have to deliver addresses and publish articles about it.\\" In 1902, Greene published \\"The Woman's Manual of Law,\\" a clear, simple, and nontechnical book of reference for women who desired to inform themselves as to the laws of business and of the domestic relations. The Chicago Legal News of November 8, 1902, said of it:‚Äî \\"This book is the result of years of experience of Greene, a member of the Boston bar, as lecturer upon the subject of which it treats. . . . The entire cycle of a woman's life, from her marriage to the grave, is passed in review in successive chapters. First, the laws affecting the domestic relations are considered. Then follow those dealing with buying and selling and the care of all kinds of property. In every case the particular legal restrictions upon the powers of the woman who is married are considered. Lastly, the proper disposition of property by will and by the laws of inheritance is treated, including the rights of the widow or the widower in the property of either. Miss Greene has shown good judgment, not only in the selection of her subjects treated, but in her manner of treating them. Her style is pleasing and easily understood. Every woman who can read the English language, and wishes to know her legal rights, should have this manual of Miss Greene's for a companion. The gifted author tells us, while all the laws discussed in this volume are of equal importance to men, it is entitled 'The Woman's Manual of Law' because it is a selection of laws that women especially need to know.\\" Among Greene's literary accomplishments were a translation from the French of Dr. Louis Frank's essay, \\"The Woman Lawyer\\". The translation appeared serially in the \\"Chicago Law Times\\" for the year 1889. Dr. Frank dedicated to Greene his Cati'chisme de la Femme in 1895. This work was translated into nearly every language of Continental Europe. =Lecturer= Greene was a regular lecturer of business law for women in Lasell Seminary (now Lasell College), in Auburndale, Massachusetts, the first women's school to give systematic instruction in the principles of law. As a public speaker, Greene was very successful, speaking without notes. At the 40th anniversary of the first woman's rights convention, celebrated in Boston in January, 1891, Greene was invited to speak for \\"Women in Law\\" as the representative of that profession. She was not, however, identified in any way with the women's suffrage movement. She believed that her mission was to educate women regarding the rights they possess, and that others would work on demanding further rights for women. =Organizer= Greene was commissioned by the Governor of Rhode Island chairman of the Rhode Island Committee on a Colonial Exhibit at the Atlanta Exposition; and the Legislature, upon her sole petition as chairman, appropriated US$1,000 for the colonial exhibit. This is said to be the first time in history that State funds were placed in the control of a commission composed exclusively of women, by a direct grant to them from the Legislature itself. Since 1898, Greene served a vice-president of the Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society. In January, 1902, she was, by formal vote of the Board of Directors, made its authorized legal adviser. From 1895, she was president of the Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society of Rhode Island, a State branch of the general society. At the 40th Anniversary of the first Woman's Rights Convention she represented women in the legal profession. The meeting, presided over by Lucy Stone, was held in Tremont Temple, January 27, 1891, and Greene spoke on \\"Women in the Law\\". She was State Regent for Rhode Island of the Daughters of the American Revolution from 1895 to 1897, and later became an Honorary State Regent. Personal life Greene was a member of the Baptist Church. She died in 1936.

During its existence the country played a prominent role in the promotion of multilateralism and narrowing of the Cold War divisions in which various UN bodies were perceived as important vehicles. Yugoslavia was elected non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council on multiple occasions in periods between 1950‚Äì1951, 1956, 1972‚Äì1973, and 1988‚Äì1989, which was in total 7 (out of 47) years of Yugoslav membership in the organization. The country was also one of 17 original members of the Special Committee on Decolonization. In 1980 under the chairmanship of Ivo Margan Belgrade hosted the 21st UNESCO General Conference as the seventh host city in the world. The city also hosted the UNCTAD VI Conference in 1983. Yugoslav diplomat Stanoje Simic was one of the candidates at the 1946 United Nations Secretary-General selection, while Lazar Mojsov was 34th President of the United Nations General Assembly. Yugoslav diplomats were Presidents of the United Nations Economic and Social Council in the 1946 3rd session (Andrija ≈†tampar, Acting), 1982 (Miljan Komatina), and from January until June 1992 (Darko ≈†iloviƒá). After the breakup of Yugoslavia, its seat at the United Nations was not inherited and continued directly by any of the six federal republics due to the shared state succession acknowledged in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 777. Instead, they all applied for membership as a new member states. For some time the rump Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resisted this interpretation and it rejoined the UN only in 2000, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, as a new member state. It changed the name to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and its seat was transferred to Serbia in 2006 following Montenegro's independence. UN's reaction to Yugoslav crisis included establishment of the UNPROFOR and UNCRO missions, UNTAES and UNMIK transitional administrations as well as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Those establishments influenced development of the United Nations peacekeeping and the establishment of the permanent International Criminal Court. History =Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia / Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945‚Äì1992)= The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia disintegrated into several states starting in the early 1990s. By 2006, six UN member states existed in its former territory. Kosovo declared independence in 2008. Yugoslavia, joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945. It was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued its own version of \\"Communism\\" under Marshal Josip Broz Tito. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a doctrine of \\"Brotherhood and unity\\", but tensions between ethnicities began to escalate with the so-called Croatian Spring of 1970‚Äì71, a movement for greater Croatian autonomy, which was suppressed. In 1974 there followed constitutional changes, and the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution devolved some of the federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian- majority SAP Kosovo with the 1981 protests in Kosovo. In late 1980s Serbian leader Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá used the Kosovo crisis to stoke up Serb nationalism and attempt to consolidate and dominate the country, which alienated the other ethnic groups. During 1990, the communists lost power to separatist parties in the first multi-party elections held across the country, except in Serbia and Montenegro, where they were won by Milo≈°eviƒá and his allies. Nationalist rhetoric on all sides became increasingly heated. In 1991, one republic after another proclaimed independence (only Serbia and Montenegro remained federated), but the status of Serb minorities outside Serbia was left unsolved. After a string of inter-ethnic incidents, the Yugoslav Wars ensued, first in Croatia and then, most severely, in multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina; the wars left long-term economic and political damage in the region. In November 1991, the Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia, led by Robert Badinter, concluded at the request of Lord Carrington that the SFR Yugoslavia was in the process of dissolution, that the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia did not have a right to self- determination in the form of new states, and that the borders between the republics were to be recognized as international borders. As a result of the conflict, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 721 on 27 November 1991, which paved the way to the establishment of the United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia. In January 1992, Croatia and Yugoslavia signed an armistice under UN supervision, while negotiations continued between Serb and Croat leaderships over the partitioning of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 15 January 1992, the independence of Croatia and Slovenia was recognized worldwide. By then, it had been effectively dissolved into five independent states, which were all subsequently admitted to the UN: * Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia were admitted to the UN on 22 May 1992. * Macedonia was admitted to the UN on 8 April 1993, being provisionally referred to for all purposes within the UN as \\"The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\\" , due to pressure from Greece, pending settlement of the difference that had arisen over its name. Following the ratification of the Prespa Agreement, the country renamed itself North Macedonia on 12 February 2019. Due to the dispute over its legal successor states, the member state \\"Yugoslavia\\", referring to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, remained on the official roster of UN members for many years after its effective dissolution. Following the admission of all five states as new UN members, \\"Yugoslavia\\" was removed from the official roster of UN members. =Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbia and Montenegro (2000‚Äì2006)= The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, established on 28 April 1992 as a rump state by the remaining Yugoslav republics of Montenegro and Serbia, claimed itself as the legal successor state of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; however, on 30 May 1992, United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 was adopted, by which it imposed international sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its role in the Yugoslav Wars, and noted that \\"the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted,\\" and on 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, by which it considered that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations,\\" and therefore decided that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly\\". The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to comply with the resolution for many years, but following the ousting of President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá from office, it re- applied for membership, and was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000 as a new member. On 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had its official name changed to Serbia and Montenegro, following the adoption and promulgation of the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro by the Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On the basis of a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2006. In a letter dated on the same day, the President of Serbia informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the UN was being continued by Serbia, following Montenegro's declaration of independence, in accordance with the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro was admitted to the UN on 28 June 2006.

Fichtelgebirge (Oberfranken) in Germany. The complex of museums was the result of the merger of the European Industrial Museum for Porcelain, the European Museum of Technical Ceramics, the Rosenthal Museum and the German Porcelain Museum in Hohenberg an der Eger. Since 2012, the Porzellanikon has been included in the European Route of Ceramics as a member of the \\"UNIC\\" (\\"Urban Network for Innovation in Ceramics\\").  Selb locations  Porzellanikon ‚Äì Selb The city of Selb is considered the center of the German porcelain industry. The porcelain manufacturers located in Selb and the surrounding area are market leaders in the field of tableware porcelain. The museum complex of Porzellanikon Selb is composed of three museums. The European Industrial Museum of Porcelain shows the manufacture of porcelain. The European Museum of Technical Ceramics deals with the use of ceramics in the fields of medicine, electrical engineering and aerospace. The Rosenthal Museum documents the product and design history of Rosenthal AG, a manufacturer of porcelain and other household products. = European Industrial Museum for Porcelain = The European Industrial Museum for Porcelain is located on the former factory premises of Rosenthal AG in Selb-Pl√∂√überg (Bavaria). Founded in 1866, the factory is now a recognized industrial monument. The museum shows the development of porcelain production in a factory and the conditions from the beginning of the production of ceramics to the present including original workplaces. It is an anchor point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH). The museum shows how crockery was made from the porcelain raw materials over the last centuries. Screens show the inner life of complex machines and make their functioning understandable. The use of special software enables the experimental design of three-dimensional porcelain objects. Touchscreen applications can be used to answer further questions. The museum also addresses social issues. = European Museum of Technical Ceramics = The European Museum of Technical Ceramics was opened on 10 October 2005 as part of Porzellanikon Selb. It is the first museum in Europe dedicated to high-performance ceramics. Numerous manufacturers of technical ceramics and the Association of the Ceramic Industry (Selb) participated in its development. For the first time, technical ceramics were used in the form of dentures at the time of the French Revolution. Under Frederick the Great the acid resistance of porcelain was used for laboratory and pharmacy equipment. In 1849 the first ceramic bell insulator was used on the telegraph route between Frankfurt and Berlin. In 1891, porcelain insulators were presented for the first time at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition in Frankfurt. The advancement of the technology brought other applications for technical ceramics. Today, technical ceramics can also be found in everyday objects such as lighters, mobile phones, espresso machines or cars, since the material is heat-resistant, durable and hard. Ceramic blades cut diamonds, for example. = Rosenthal Museum = With the Rosenthal Museum, Rosenthal AG returned to its old factory site on the occasion of its 125th anniversary. The museum is housed in the old kiln of the former factory. Originally built in 1889, the building burnt down in 1982 to the outer walls. The reconstruction took the idea of an \\"open space concept\\" into account. Of the original three consecutive round ovens, the front one was completely renovated. The museum shows the history of the company and its products in various themed islands, which began on 30 August 1879 at Schloss Erkersreuth with Philipp Rosenthal's porcelain painting. In 1917, Rosenthal acquired the porcelain factory founded by Jacob Zeidler in Selb-Pl√∂√überg in 1866. The company used the factories until they moved their production to Rotb√ºhl in 1969. As a manufacturer of living and lifestyle products, Rosenthal used an early connection between art, architecture, design, porcelain and other materials. Based on the designs of Rosenthal's product designers such as Walter Gropius, Elsa Fischer-Treyden and Bj√∏rn Wiinblad. The company was able to win internationally renowned artists to design ceramic wares, including Salvador Dal√≠, Friedensreich Hundertwasser and Niki de Saint Phalle. In 2009, the Rosenthal collection of the insolvent porcelain manufacturer Rosenthal was bought by the State Supervision Foundation, including the originals of Salvador Dal√≠ and Andy Warhol. The foundation left the remains of the manufacturing plant to the Porcelain Museum. Selb - Porzellanikon - Bachenbrecher - 01.jpgBachenbrecher. Selb - Porzellanikon - Kollergang - 01.jpgKollergang.

Hohenberg an der Eger location  Porzellanikon ‚Äì Hohenberg The German Porcelain Museum was opened in Hohenberg on the Eger in 1982. Previously, the complex had served as the home of the family's company Hutschenreuther founded by Carolus Magnus Hutschenreuther. With the foundation of the first porcelain factory in northeast Bavaria in 1814 Hutschenreuther had laid the foundations in Hohenberg for the region to quickly became the center of the German porcelain industry. In 1995, the historical house was extended by a modern extension of glass and steel to 2000 m¬≤. Today, the museum shows some 12,000 exhibits, more than 150,000 parts are in the depot. The permanent exhibition shows porcelain products from China as well as all kinds of porcelain produced in the German- speaking world, both precious individual products for noblemen as well as industrial products. The tour is chronological. In each room the visitor is shown features of a Kunstepoche. In front of the buildings is the former factory garden with apple trees and rose leaves.
