Maiasmokk () is an old caf√© in the capital city of Tallinn, Estonia that is located at the address of Pikk tn 16. It is said to have finished in its modern form in 1864, making it the oldest operational caf√© in Estonia. The premises also contain a museum about the history and uses of marzipan. It is currently owned by the Kalev company. Location and description = Caf√© = The official website of the Maiasmokk says that the caf√© \\"offers you fresh pastries, pies and cakes made at the cafe as well as delicious handmade candies.\\" It also has hot coffee offered in a variety of forms. The caf√© has two floors. The coffee-house is located at the intersection of Pikk and P√ºhavaimu streets, in the Old Town of Tallinn. It lies diagonally opposite the Church of the Holy Ghost, and the Great Guild (housing parts of the Estonian History Museum). The interior of the caf√© has remained unchanged for almost a century. The caf√© is open on Mondays through Fridays from 8 A.M. to 9 P.M. (all times are in Eastern European Time/Eastern European Summer Time) and on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. The second floor is open throughout the week from 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. = Museum = Apart from the caf√©, the premises also contain a room with an exhibition about the history and uses of marzipan. The room has around 200 marzipan figures, made from molds over 100 years old, and features marzipan painting and lectures. A marzipan artist, who does the marzipan painting, is always located in the museum. The museum is open throughout the week from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. History Maiasmokk is said to be the oldest cafe which is still operational in Estonia. The history of the coffee-house goes back to August 11 1806, when sugar baker Lorenz Cavietzel obtained the right to the land on which the present building stands. It was the first sugar bakery was established here, but it was not until 1864 that the presently visible caf√© was constructed. In 1864, the property was bought and redeveloped by the Baltic German confectioner Georg Stude, and a caf√© has operated in the premises since then. During the late 19th century, the coffee-house became renowned for its marzipan production, and clients buying marzipan included the Russian Imperial family. At the beginning of the 20th century, prior to World War I, the caf√© received several valuable awards. In 1941, the company became nationalised, but the caf√© continued to operate during the Soviet occupation of Estonia. In 1997, after Estonia had re-gained its independence, the caf√© was registered as a private enterprise. A majority of the shares were bought by Kalev in 2004, and it is today (2015) a part of the Kalev company. In 2006 the Estonian Post Office created a postage stamp to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the cafe. In 2010, Kalev also bought the house in which the caf√© is located.

The term has been used in a range of contexts in scientific literature and in casual usage (see Research), but is most associated with The Carbon Literacy Project (CLP).The Carbon Literacy Project logo  Definition  Carbon Literacy is the knowledge and capacity required to create a positive shift in how mankind lives, works and behaves in response to climate change. The Carbon Literacy Project defines Carbon Literacy as \\"an awareness of the carbon costs and impacts of everyday activities and the ability and motivation to reduce emissions, on an individual, community and organisational basis.\\" To distinguish between the use of the phrase in its abstract sense ('carbon literacy') (e.g.), and its use under the established definition (Carbon Literacy), the phrase is capitalised (e.g.). See Research.  The Carbon Literacy Project (CLP)  The term Carbon Literacy had been used informally on a number of earlier occasions, but began to gain prominence in 2009 when it emerged in the development of the climate change action plan for Manchester, Manchester: A Certain Future. This citizen-written plan pledged the UK's second largest urban area to: # Reduce the city of Manchester‚Äôs emissions of carbon dioxide by 41% by 2020, from 2005 levels. # To engage all individuals, neighbourhoods and organisations in Manchester in a process of cultural change that embeds ‚Äòlow-carbon thinking‚Äô into the lifestyles and operations of the city. The plan therefore aimed to (i) lower emissions by reducing demand for and use of energy; altering the technologies used for energy generation; and changing the sources of the fuels used from fossil fuels to renewables; and (ii) create a 'low-carbon culture' by building a common understanding of the causes and implications of climate change, and to develop programmes of 'carbon literacy'. As a collectively written and owned plan, any citizen or organisation could respond to assist in the delivery of aims and objectives, however it took until 2010 before a Manchester-based social enterprise Cooler Projects CIC took up the challenge of delivery of the Carbon Literacy objective: ‚Äú...every resident, pupil, student and employee [in the city] will have had at least one day's training in climate change‚Ä¶probably several by 2020. In 2011, Cooler convened a voluntary 30-person working group drawn from all sectors who, working collectively, created a definition for the term, and established requirements for a day's training to meet that definition. These requirements formed the basis of The Carbon Literacy Standard. The Standard was based on the key premise that if mankind is to cut carbon emissions by the kind of reduction targets demanded by science, we will need to change our culture as well as our technology. In 2012, Cooler began to pilot its approach with schools, workplaces, and communities. It quickly established a not for profit initiative - The Carbon Literacy Project - initially in Manchester but rapidly beyond, to oversee the delivery of training to meet the Standard, and certifying successful participants as ‚ÄúCarbon Literate‚Äù. In the same year the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) (which includes Manchester), established Carbon Literacy as one of the four aims of the Greater Manchester Climate Change Strategy. In 2014, the Project was incorporated as a registered charity (a legal not-for- profit structure in the UK) The Carbon Literacy Trust (registered charity No.1156722) so that the concept of Carbon Literacy and its IP could be delivered in perpetuity, for the public good. In 2015, The Carbon Literacy Project was selected from a global field to be part of the Transformative Actions Program (TAP) at the UN Climate Change summit (COP21) in Paris, December 2015. The Carbon Literacy Project is therefore formally recognised as one of the top 100 responses the world has to offer in order to tackle climate change. In 2015, Councillor Jeff Smith became the first Carbon Literate MP. in 2016, The Carbon Literacy Project introduced an accreditation scheme called the Carbon Literate Organisation (CLO) accreditation.  Carbon Literate Organisation (CLO)  The Carbon Literate Organisation (CLO) accreditation and associated CLO Standard were designed and launched by The Carbon Literacy Project (2016) in order to provide a visible ‚Äòbadge‚Äô that showcases an organisation as (i) committed to Carbon Literacy (CL), (ii) having a substantial number of people who are Carbon Literate, and (iii) having a commitment to support its Carbon Literate people and maintain its low carbon culture. An organisation uses this status to better interact with its communities‚Äìwhether they are staff or customers, neighbours, learners, suppliers or stakeholders. The four tiers of accreditation (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) ensures distinction between organisations showing differing levels of commitment. Worldwide to date, fourteen organisations are registered as Carbon Literate Organisations (CLOs), including The University of Manchester, Manchester Museum and Northwards Housing.  Research  The use of the term ‚Äòcarbon literacy‚Äô is increasingly widespread in everyday language and scientific literature, and includes (i) research that specifically evaluates Carbon Literacy and The Carbon Literacy Project, and (ii) the use of the term 'carbon literacy' in a more abstract sense. Behavioural responses to climate change are limited due to the uncertainty and complexity associated with the subject. Current research focuses on the need for societal engagement in the mitigation of climate change, through an increase of understanding amongst citizens, organisations, schools and public bodies due to the uncertainty and complexity associated with the subject. Dissemination of Carbon Literacy (CL) training (which includes the causes and consequences of carbon emissions, and an understanding of the power of individual action) has been shown to qualitatively influence positive behaviour change with regard to reducing carbon footprints. Following CL training, energy and carbon-saving behaviour (including both individual and collective actions) has been shown to increase, including evidence of the ‚Äòcascade effect‚Äô‚Äìwhere participants discussed CL with family, friends or colleagues. In Greater Manchester CL is being disseminated to those that live (via housing associations), those that work (BBC, Media City, Peel Media, ITV, Dock10, local authorities, Groundwork, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue) and those that study (University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University). Other studies conducted over the last two decades refer to the abstract concept of 'carbon literacy', and its importance in low-carbon behaviour change. For example, Horng et al. looked into the development of low carbon choices in the Taiwanese tourism industry, and Teng et al. found that 'carbon literacy' significantly improves low-carbon behaviour in the hospitality industry in Taiwan. Studies have also focussed on ‚Äòcarbon literacy practices‚Äô in children‚Äôs construction of knowledge about climate change. Here, significantly higher levels of climate change knowledge and understanding were found in pupils from ‚Äòeco-schools‚Äô as opposed to ‚Äònon-eco-schools‚Äô, indicating the importance of Carbon Literacy within community settings to facilitate culture change.

He is also the founder and Director of the Graduate Program in Bioinformatics of the University of Crete Medical School, and has served as Director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, where he is heading the Neurogenetics and Ageing laboratory.  Biographical information  He completed his undergraduate studies at the Department of Biology of the Aristotle University, in Thessaloniki, Greece, and obtained his PhD degree from the Department of Biology of the University of Crete, in Heraklion, Greece. He trained as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry of Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. He has made notable contributions relevant to cell death, neurodegeneration and ageing, documented in the scientific literature. He is a member of the Scientific Council of the European Research Council (ERC), the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Governing Board, the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), Academia Europaea and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He is also a corresponding member of the Academy of Athens. His work has received several prominent awards and scientific prizes, including two European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator grant awards (in 2008 and 2016), a European Research Council (ERC) Proof of Concept grant award, the EMBO Young Investigator award, the International Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) long-term postdoctoral fellowship, the BioMedical Research Award of the Academy of Athens, the Valergakis Post- Graduate Award of the Hellenic University Club of New York, the Galien Scientific Research Award, the Helmholtz International Fellow Award, the Bodossaki Foundation Scientific Prize for Medicine and Biology, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel research award, the Research Excellence award of the Foundation for Research and Technology, and the Empeirikeion Foundation Academic Excellence Prize, among others.  Research and scientific achievements  Nektarios Tavernarakis has contributed to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration, the interplay between cellular metabolism and ageing, the mechanisms of sensory transduction and integration by the nervous system. He has also contributed towards the development of novel genetic tools for biomedical research, including an RNA interference (RNAi) method that allows efficient knockdown of neuronal genes. His PhD Thesis research focused on the expression and function of key stress response transcriptional activators in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and provided original insights on the regulation of these activators by nutrient limitation, and the role of DNA in determining interactions between transcription factors and co-factors. His laboratory at IMBB was the first to commence Caenorhabditis elegans research in Greece. Among the notable discoveries of his team are the sophisticated molecular mechanisms, by which diverse physiological signals are integrated to modulate cellular mitochondrial content, protein synthesis, and energy homeostasis during ageing. These studies revealed intricate signaling pathways that coordinate mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, to determine the number of mitochondria in cells, under stress and during ageing. Work from his lab implicated autophagy, lysosomal function, endocytosis, intracellular calcium homeostasis and specific proteolytic enzymes as major contributors to necrosis and neurodegeneration. His group developed, for the first time, experimental heat stroke models; and identified mechanisms protecting against heat cytotoxicity and other necrotic insults. He has isolated and characterized specific ion channels, involved in proprioception and coordinated locomotion, in dopaminergic signalling and associative learning. His team was also the first to delineate the role of autophagy in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and behaviour under nutrient deprivation and stress.

The label's albums were distributed by Priority, Universal and Koch Records. The label included artists such as Snoop Dogg, Mercedes, Silkk the Shocker, Mystikal, Mia X, Mac, C-Murder, Magic, Short Circuit, Lil Soldiers, Romeo Miller, Fiend, Kane & Abel, Soulja Slim, CFO Jefferson Macks, among others. In the late nineties, No Limit Records achieved mainstream success with such releases as Master P's \\"Ghetto D\\", T.R.U.'s \\"Tru 2 da Game\\", and Snoop Dogg's \\"Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told\\". The label is often accredited as forebearers furthering the rise of southern hip-hop and laying the blueprint for independent ownership in rap music. History =1991‚Äì1995: Beginnings= Percy \\"Master P\\" Miller began his career by distributing his records through a small California Bay Area record label, \\"No Limit Record Shop\\", which started out in Richmond. He moved to Richmond to get away from the violence that plagued his city of New Orleans, in particular, the Calliope housing projects where he hustled to survive. Master P would then use a $10,000 settlement check from his grandfather's malpractice suit to fund his record store and lay the foundation for his future label. During the early 1990s, Master P released many solo albums with little success. However, Miller was able to garner notoriety for himself and the fledgling No Limit label on the West Coast by collaborating with various artists on compilation albums such as West Coast Bad Boyz 1 & 2\\\\. By 1994, the label was on the rise, and Master P decided the time was right to expand the product. After signing Oakland rapper Dangerous Dame, who released the EP Escape from the Mental Ward through No Limit, he began working with New Orleans-based talent, starting with Kane & Abel (then known as Double Vision) and Mystikal, while TRU's third album, True, achieved gold status. =1995‚Äì1999: Successful years and deal with Priority Records= In 1995, Master P officially relocated No Limit to New Orleans, while keeping his brothers and several California rappers like TRU member Big Ed, King George and Calli G on board. He then added local talent to his roster such as Mystikal, Mia X, Kane & Abel, Fiend, Tre-8 and Mr. Serv-On. No Limit then signed a distribution deal with Priority Records, while Master P maintained ownership of his master recordings and recording studio. He also became the label's main artist, and released Ice Cream Man in 1996 and Ghetto D a little bit more than a year later. By 1997, No Limit had gained momentum with bestselling, if not critically acclaimed, releases from TRU (Tru 2 Da Game), Mia X's Unlady Like, which went gold despite producing no hit singles, and Mystikal's platinum-selling Unpredictable. The label also acquired their first marquee name in Snoop Dogg, on the heels of his acrimonious split from Death Row Records. His debut album for No Limit, Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told, was the most successful release in the label's history at the time, as it sold over half a million copies in its first week and was certified double platinum in less than three months. As No Limit's popularity and mainstream coverage increased, so did its roster. The label signed individual producers DJ Daryl, Randy Jefferson, K-Lou & Dez as well as Master P's main production team, Beats by the Pound (KLC, Mo B. Dick, Craig B, and Odell; they would ultimately depart the label in 1999 due to financial disputes) and Carlos Stephens, in addition to solo artists Mac, Mercedes, Soulja Slim, Full Blooded, Fiend, Magic, Skull Duggery, plus groups such as R&B; quartet Sons of Funk, Short Circuit, Oakland-based pair Steady Mobb'n, Ghetto Commission, Prime Suspects, and Gambino Family. Together they would put out a combined 23 albums in 1998, of those 10 went platinum and 11 went gold, in some instances their lone releases with the label. Master P's own LP that year, MP da Last Don, which featured him on a lenticular cover, reached number one on the Billboard 200 after moving 495,000 copies in its first week, and sold 4.5 million units overall, making it the best-selling album of his career. At the peak of its popularity, No Limit became notorious for producing lengthy albums that consisted of up to twenty tracks and numerous cameo appearances by the label's other artists (there were eighteen alone on Soulja Slim's 1998 release Give It 2 'Em Raw), in addition to the cheap packaging of its CDs in cases that consisted mostly of cardboard stock and a small amount of plastic, as well as spearheading the movement of garish Pen & Pixel-designed album covers. =2000‚Äì2003: Continued success and decline= Master P began to expand his horizons beyond music. He wrote, directed and acted in the underground movie I'm Bout It and contributed to the soundtrack, as well as two high-budget theatrical releases, 1998's I Got the Hook Up and 1999's Foolish. Meanwhile, World Championship Wrestling president Eric Bischoff, attempting to capitalize on the rapper's popularity while searching for a quick fix to boost sagging television ratings, signed Master P to a contract at a reported $200,000 per TV appearance. He and his stable, The No Limit Soldiers, which included some of Master P's lackeys and midcard wrestlers Brad Armstrong and Chase Tatum, feuded with Curt Hennig and The West Texas Rednecks, who had recorded a single called \\"Rap is Crap.\\" Bischoff hoped the Soldiers would be embraced by fans as faces and the Rednecks as heels, but he achieved the exact opposite result and the Soldiers were gone after a year. Master P even tried to make it as an NBA player with a brief but ill-fated tryout with the Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors. As for No Limit, while Silkk the Shocker's 1999 release, Made Man, debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200, increasingly fewer releases featured cameos from the label's marquee artists, leading their fans to the correct conclusion that they had left the label. 1999 also saw the arrivals of Lil Italy and kid duo Lil Soldiers. In 2000 504 Boyz album Goodfellas made it big on the Billboard peaking at #2 on the Billboard 200 making No Limit a small factor in the 2000s, but in 2000 only Master P, Snoop Dogg, C-Murder, Silkk, Magic, Mac and Mia X remained from their most celebrated artists. Other performers such as 6 Piece, Short Circuit, former Gambino Family members D.I.G. and Young Gunz, Popeye, Baby Soulja, Black Felon, Afficial, Samm, Currensy, Choppa and Krazy were brought aboard from 1999 to 2000, but some failed to create interest in themselves or in No Limit Records; only the artists Currensy, Lil Romeo, C-Murder and Krazy Lil Soldiers have enjoyed any type of longevity over the past decade since Master P's departure from the label. In addition, popular artists such as Mystikal and Magic had left and would put out albums to varied results; Mystikal's first post-No Limit record, Let's Get Ready, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 2000, while Magic's first release, 2003's On My Own, failed to chart. On December 17, 2003, the company filed for bankruptcy due to various lawsuits, and Master P then sold the catalog. Reorganization In 2001, No Limit left Priority Records and signed a distribution deal with Universal. The label's name was changed to The New No Limit. The first release under the New No Limit banner was Master P's tenth album, Game Face. With Universal, the label also released new albums by the 504 Boyz, Lil' Romeo, Magic and Choppa. In 2004, the reorganized label had moved to Koch Records for distribution. From 2004 to 2005, The New No Limit Records issued new albums by Master P, Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder, Lil' Romeo and the reformed TRU. In 2005, Master P established a new label called Guttar Music Entertainment. On November 26, 2010, No Limit was established again as No Limit Forever Records.

Debbie started her career in 2011 as part of the now-defunct group The White Girl Mob, with rappers Kreayshawn and V-Nasty. In 2012, Debbie started a solo career, releasing a series of singles with rappers Riff Raff and former White Girl Mob group member V-Nasty, some of which ended up on her first solo project, a mixtape titled Keep It Lit. In October 2013, Debbie released her first EP, titled Queen D. In March 2014, Debbie released her second EP, California Sweetheart, followed by California Sweetheart Pt. 2 later in the same year. In November 2014, Debbie released her second mixtape, Young B!tch. Debbie also DJs under the moniker 'CAPOZZI'. Early life Lil Debbie was born and raised in Albany, California. She is of Italian descent and has a dual Italian and American citizenship. After graduating high school, she went on to study fashion design at FIDM. Later, she dropped out due to \\"having too much homework\\". When she was 15 years old, Debbie met Kreayshawn and V-Nasty, she was an only child and spent most of her time with the two, and considered them as her 'sisters'. The three later went on to create the group The White Girl Mob. Music career In 2011, Lil Debbie appeared in the music video for Kreayshawn's debut single \\"Gucci Gucci\\". In September 2011, it was reported that Debbie had been kicked out of The White Girl Mob, due to being disloyal to the other members of the group. Debbie stated poor communication and misunderstandings in the group were the main reasons for her departure. Debbie later stated she didn't have much input in the group and she was just following the others' decisions. Debbie has also stated that she has no relationship with the members of the group as of 2014. In 2012, Debbie collaborated with Houston rapper RiFF RaFF on a number of songs together, including \\"Squirt\\", \\"Brain Freeze\\", \\"Michelle Obama\\" and \\"Suckas Askin' Questions\\". Debbie's videos for \\"Squirt\\", \\"2 Cups\\", and \\"Gotta Ball\\" became popular, each gaining over 2,000,000 views on YouTube, and the success of the songs helped to catapult her career. Some of the singles released, including \\"Squirt\\", \\"Brain Freeze\\", and \\"2 Cups\\", made it on to Debbie's first mixtape, Keep It Lit, released in July 2012. In February 2013, the single, \\"I Do It\\" featuring K00LJOHN was released. On October 22, 2013, Debbie released her first EP, titled Queen D, which includes three original songs and two remixes. A second EP, titled California Sweetheart, was set for release in the summer of 2013, but was delayed and eventually released on March 25, 2014. On August 5 of the same year, Debbie released her third EP, a follow up to California Sweetheart, titled California Sweetheart Pt. 2. This was followed by the rapper's second mixtape Young B!tch, released on November 24, 2014. On June 10, 2015, Debbie's single \\"Lofty\\" was released on iTunes. In 2015, Debbie debuted her line of baked goods titled \\"Cakes\\" at the Blazer's Cup in 2015. On March 3, 2017, Debbie released her fourth EP, titled XXIII, including five originals.

Members in the United Kingdom are barred from joining the British Prison Service,Staff Membership of Racist Groups and Organisations: Annex A , HM Prison Service, 2001 armed forces, and police.\\"Officer resigns over BNP badge\\" , BBC News, 3 October 2008 On 23 January 2020, the German government announced a ban of the German offshoot of Combat 18. Name Combat 18's name is often abbreviated \\"C18\\". The \\"18\\" in its name is derived from the initials of the Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler: A and H are the first and eighth letters of the Latin alphabet. History =Founding= In early 1992, the far-right British National Party (BNP) formed Combat 18 as a stewarding group whose purpose was to protect its events from anti-fascists. Its founders included Charlie Sargent and Harold Covington. C18 soon attracted national attention for threats of violence against immigrants, members of ethnic minorities and leftists.World in Action documentary, April 1993 In 1992, it started publishing the Redwatch magazine, which contained photographs, the names and addresses of political opponents. Combat 18 is an openly neo-Nazi group that is devoted to violence and hostile to electoral politics, and for this reason Sargent split decisively from the BNP in 1993. =1997: murder of Christopher Castle= Sargent split with his former C18 colleagues over allegations that he was an informer for the British security services. The rival faction, led by Wilf \\"The Beast\\" Browning, wanted Sargent to return the C18 membership list, in exchange for the return of his plastering tools and ¬£1,000. However, such was the animosity and fear between them that a mutually acceptable go- between, 28-year-old C18 member \\"Catford Chris\\" Castle, was driven to Sargent's mobile home in Harlow, Essex, by Browning, who waited in the car, while Castle went to visit Sargent. He was met at the door by Charlie Sargent and his political associate, the former Skrewdriver guitarist Martin Cross. Cross plunged a nine-inch (22 cm) blade into Castle's back. Browning took Castle to hospital in a taxi, but doctors were unable to save him and he died shortly after arrival. Despite Sargent's attempt to implicate Browning, Sargent was convicted of murder at Chelmsford Crown Court the following year. He and Cross were sentenced to life imprisonment. Cross remains in prison and, following a short period on licence, Sargent was returned to custody on the weekend of 15 November 2014. =Post-Sargent history= Between 1998 and 2000, dozens of Combat 18 members in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland were arrested on various charges during dawn raids by the police. These raids were part of several operations which were conducted by Scotland Yard in co- operation with MI5. Those arrested included Steve and Bill Sargent (Charlie Sargent's brothers), David Myatt and two serving British soldiers, Darren Theron (Parachute Regiment) and Carl Wilson.Rajeev Syal and Andrew Gilligan, \\"MI5 swoops on Army 'neo-Nazis'\\", Sunday Telegraph, 7 March 1999.

Some journalists believed that the White Wolves are a C18 splinter group, alleging that the group had been set up by Del O'Connor, the former second-in-command of C18 and a member of Skrewdriver Security.Stuart Millar, \\"Anti-terror police seek White Wolf racist over bombs\\", The Guardian, 28 April 1999 The document issued by the White Wolves announcing their formation has been attributed to David Myatt,\\"Theoretician of Terror\\", Searchlight, issue #301, July 2000. whose Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution allegedly inspired the nailbomber David Copeland,Weitzman, Mark (2006): \\"Antisemitismus und Holocaust-Leugnung: Permanente Elemente des globalen Rechtsextremismus\\", in Greven, Thomas: Globalisierter Rechtsextremismus?

In late 2010, five members of Combat 18 Australia (among them Jacob Marshall Hort and Bradley Neil Trappitt) were charged over an attack on a mosque in Perth, Western Australia. Several rounds were fired from a high-powered rifle into the Canning Turkish Islamic Mosque, causing over $15,000 damage. The online forum presence of Combat 18 was officially ended at the end of November 2014, with the Combat 18 forum redirecting to a US-based nationalist video and DVD merchandising store which now owns the domain. On 6 March 2018, 8 members of the extreme right neo-Nazi group Combat 18 were arrested in Athens, Greece, accused of multiple attacks on immigrants and activists. They had 50 kg of ANFO in their possession.http://news247.gr/eidiseis/koinonia/o-tsamp-ths-combat-18-kai-o- lukos-ths-xryshs-ayghs-epivevaiwnoyn-th-logikh-twn-sygkoinwnountwn- doxeiwn.5111561.html On 23 January 2020, an important day in German history, because 75 years previously Allied forces liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp, the German Minister of Interior banned Combat 18 nationwide in Germany. More than 200 police officers carried out raids in six German states seizing mobile phones, computers, unspecified weaponry, Nazi memorabilia and propaganda material. \\\\- =Links with football hooliganism= Members of the organisation include known football hooligans and groups. The most high-profile incident involving Combat 18 members in football came on 15 February 1995, when violence broke out in the stands at Lansdowne Road in the international friendly between the Republic of Ireland and England. There was also taunting of \\"No Surrender To The IRA\\" aimed at Irish fans. The violence was so bad that the match had to be abandoned. \\\\- Before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 26 Seaburn Casuals (Sunderland AFC supporters) hooligans were arrested in a police raid after a military-issue smoke bomb was let off at a local pub after a fight with bouncers. By the end of the operation, over 60 were facing charges. Some of the Seaburn Casuals hooligans arrested in were involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. The operation failed when a judge ruled that CCTV footage from the pub was inadmissible as evidence.Andy Nicholls, Nick Lowles, Hooligans 2: The M-Z of Britain's Football Hooligan Gangs (Milo books, 2005) =The murder of Walter L√ºbcke= An alleged member of the German branch of Combat 18 named Stephen Ernst was the suspect in the case of the murdered local politician Walter L√ºbcke of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany. Ernst confessed to the crime on 25 June 2019. The Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, then announced his intention to ban the organisation in Germany.  Canada terrorism list  Due to concerted efforts by Canadians on 21 June 2019, two Neo-Nazi / Alt-Right groups were added to the Canadian terrorist list. This is in part due to Canada's response to the Christchurch mosque shootings and a petition to Canada's Federal Government: EPetition e-2019 by #NoPlace2Hate. This means that criminal acts by members of this group now additionally fall under Canada's Criminal Code for Terrorism which can include additional prison sentences for criminal acts including financial contributions to a known terrorist organisation.  Ban in Germany  On January 23, 2020, the German government announced and enforced an order banning \\"Combat 18 Deutschland\\", the German offshoot of Combat 18. The order by the Ministry of the Interior states that \\"Combat 18 Deutschland\\" is directed against the constitutional order and that its goals and activities are contrary to criminal laws and against the idea of understanding among nations. The order stipulates that the organisation be dissolved and that all assets of the organisation be seized and confiscated; in addition, signs of the organisation must no longer be used and no replacement organisation may be formed. On the day of the announcement, more than 200 police officers raided the homes of the organisation's leading members. According to the government, at the time of the ban the organisation had \\"approximately 20 members\\" and \\"an unknown number of sympathisers\\". The Interior Ministry linked the decision to the murder of Walter L√ºbcke and the Halle synagogue shooting. \\"Combat 18 Deutschland\\" filed suit against the ban in the Federal Administrative Court and asked the court to preliminarily enjoin the ban's enforcement pending a decision on the merits. In September 2020, the court rejected the latter request, stating that the public interest in the immediate enforcement of the ban prevailed over the organisation's interests, further noting that the challenge against the ban will likely not succeed as the court's summary examination of the merits suggests that the organisation's activities are indeed directed against the constitutional order.

The film concerns a young child adopted at birth by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Private Secretary Anthony, unbeknownst to his wife, after their own son is stillborn. They are surrounded by mysterious and ominous deaths, unaware that the child is the Antichrist. Plot In Coimbatore, collector Anthony (Pramoth) is in a hospital where his wife Jenny Anthony (Sindhuja) gives birth to a boy, who he told died moments after being born. Anthony is convinced by the hospital chaplain head doctor Philips (V. Gopalakrsihnan) to secretly adopt an orphan whose mother died at the same time. Anthony agrees, but does not reveal to his wife that the child is not theirs. They name the child as Xavier. Soon after, Anthony is appointed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's private secretary. When Xavier reaches the age of five, Anthony is transferred to Madras. Mysterious events plague the Anthonys: large black dogs congregate near the Anthony home; Xavier's nanny publicly hangs herself at his 5th birthday party; a new nanny Mrs. Elizabeth (Indradevi) arrives unannounced to replace her; the five-year- old Xaviet violently resists entering a church; and zoo animals are terrified of Xavier. Father Murphy (Nassar) a Catholic Priest tries repeatedly to warn the Anthonys about Xavier's mysterious origins, hinting that Xavier may not be human. The priest later tells Anthony that Jenny is pregnant and that Xavier will prevent her from having the child. Afterward, Father Murphy is impaled and killed by a lightning rod thrown from the roof of a church during a sudden storm. Upon returning home, Jenny tells Anthony that she is pregnant and wants an abortion. Learning of Father Murphy's death, photographer Swaminathan investigating Damien. He notices shadows in photographs of the Nanny and of Father Murphy that seem to presage their bizarre deaths. Photos of Swaminathan also show these shadows, Swami shows Anthony the photos and tells him he also believes that Damien is a threat and that he wants to help Anthony. While Anthony is away, Xavier knocks Jenny over an upstairs railing to the floor below, causing her to miscarry. Swami and Anthony travel to Coimbatore to investigate Xavier's birth. A fire destroyed the hospital records and the maternity and nursery wards five years earlier. Most of the staff on duty died in the fire. Anthony and Swami trace Dr. Philips to a Church abbey in Coimbatore, where he is recuperating from his injuries. Stricken mute, blind in his right eye and paralyzed in his right arm, Philips writes the name of an ancient Cemetery in Athivetti, whers Xavier's biological mother is buried. Anthony and Swami find a jackal carcass in the grave and in the child's grave next to it, the child's skeleton with a shattered skull. These are Xavier's unnatural \\"mother\\" and the remains of the Anthony's own child, murdered at birth so that Xavier could take his place. Swami reiterates Father Murphy's belief that Xavier is the Antichrist, whose coming is being supported by a conspiracy of Satanists. A pack of wild dogs, similar to ones seen near the Anthony's mansion, drive Anthony and Swami out of the cemetery. Back in Madras, Mrs. Elizabeth persuades a nurse to allow her access to Jenny, who is heavily sedated and under police protection. Once inside the room, Mrs. Elizabeth pushes Jenny out of the window, causing her to fall onto an Ambulance truck, killing her. Anthony and Swami travel to Pondicherry to find Lawrence (Thakkali Srinivasan), an archaeologist and expert on the Antichrist. Lawrence explains that if Xavier is the Antichrist he will have a birthmark in shape of three sixes, under his hair, if nowhere else. Anthony learns that the only way to kill the Antichrist is with seven mystical daggers. Appalled by the idea of murdering a child, Anthony discards the daggers, but when Swami tries to retrieve them, he is decapitated by a sheet of window glass sliding off a truck, matching the shadow across his neck, which had presaged his death. Returning home, Anthony examines Xavier for the birthmark, finding it on the child's scalp. Mrs. Elizabeth attacks him and in the ensuing struggle, Anthony kills her. He loads Xavier and the daggers in to a car and drives to nearest church. Due to his erratic driving, he is followed by the police, who arrive as he is dragging the screaming child to the altar. An officer orders him to raise his hands and stand away. Anthony raises the first dagger, and the officers fires his gun. The double funeral of Jenny and Anthony is attended by the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, who now has custody of a smiling Xavier.

Jacques Le Normand contracted the lordship of Bretteville in 1636 and the lordship was permanently ceded to the family in 1679. Marquis Louis Claude le Normand de Bretteville (1744‚Äì1835) left France during the French Revolution, became a Danish Major-General and was naturalized as a Dano- Norwegian nobleman in 1804. He was married to Catherine-Th√©r√®se Vedastine van den Driesch and has several descendants in Denmark and Norway. His third son, Charles Eug√®ne le Normand de Bretteville (1782‚Äì1854), moved to Norway in 1799, and was the father of Prime Minister Christian Zetlitz Bretteville (1800‚Äì1871).

The group organises classes at Al Aqsa Mosque from learning how to read and write to university level and Islamic tajweed or the musical chanting of Quranic verses. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel left administrative oversight of the Temple Mount/al-Haram al-Shariff to Jordan, which delegates authority to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf. Israel maintains security control. A status quo was declared where Muslims have been allowed to pray atop the compound while non-Muslims were allowed to visit unobstructed but not allowed to pray. In this context, members of Murabitat movement also keep an eye on Jews visiting the compound and who would be \\"attempting to pray\\". Women from the organisation disrupted several such attempts by shouting at the groups, cursing, and by physical assault. History The parallel groups, Murabiton for men and Murabitat for women, were created by the northern branch of the Islamist group, Islamic Movement in Israel in 2012. According to Haaretz, their purpose is \\"to harass Jews visiting Temple Mount.\\" The groups run a daily shuttle service between the concentration of Arab towns including Umm al-Fahm and Tayibe), that is called the Triangle, as well as from the Negev and the Galilee to the Temple Mount. According to Israeli security officials, before the male and female groups were banned and the offices of the NGO funding them closed, activists were paid 3,000‚Äì4,000 shekels ($771‚Äì$1,028) per month, with some of the funds coming from the Gulf States. Incidents According to Christian Broadcasting Network, the women are, \\"paid to harass female visitors to the Temple Mount even when they're modestly dressed.\\" In August, 2015, the women harassed a group of visiting Members of the United States Congress, including Rep. Evan Jenkins, Rep. Trent Franks, Rep. Keith Rothfus and Mr. Jenkins' wife, Elizabeth Jenkins. Congressman Jenkins described himself as being, \\"struck by the level of intolerance and the confrontational attitudes and approach and actions\\" taken by the group.\\" He described the behavior of the Muslims on the Temple Mount that day as \\"shocking\\".

Earlier, the Arab League condemned the plan to ban the group. On September 8, 2015, Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon signed an order which declared the Murabitat group as an illegal organization.

Sanskrit commentary on Visheshavashyaka remained unfinished.

Total assets are over $500 million and it employs approximately 100 individuals. It traces its origins to 1865, and serves over 30,000 customers with a full range of banking and financial services through nine banking centers in Johnson, Muscatine, Scott and Washington Counties in Iowa, and Rock Island County in Illinois. History The story of CBI Bank & Trust actually consists of the history of four banks ‚Äî Central State Bank, Freedom Security Bank, West Chester Savings Bank, and Buffalo Prairie State Bank ‚Äî that came together to form the organization. Central State Bank Central State Bank's history can be traced to the mid-nineteenth century, a time when \\"private banks\\" ‚Äî those not open to the general public ‚Äî were the norm. The private banking house of Isett and Brewster of Muscatine was one of the earliest of this type in Iowa and operated successfully for a number of years. On May 1, 1865, it was converted to a state-chartered institution, Merchants Exchange Bank, which was opened to the general public. Later that year, conversion to a national charter brought a change in name to Merchants National Exchange Bank.\\"History of Muscatine County, Iowa,\\" Western Historical Company, Chicago, IL, 1879. Page 550. In the early years, it was not unusual for banks to operate under two charters, one national and one state, with both institutions located in the same building and owned by the same stockholders. Nationally chartered banks traditionally catered to the needs of businesses and they could issue their own bank notes, which served as currency in the absence of today's Federal Reserve Notes. By contrast, state-chartered institutions emphasized serving individuals and families by accepting savings deposits and making loans for personal and home financing. In 1880, state-chartered Muscatine Savings Bank was organized for the purpose of serving the community in tandem with Merchants Exchange National Bank.Lewis, W.H., \\"Picturesque Muscatine, Pearl City of Iowa,\\" The Democrat Co. Printers, Davenport, IA, 1901. Pages 83-84. During the intervening years, this dual-bank organization continued to grow. There were a couple of name changes along the way: in 1886, Merchants National became the First National Bank of Muscatine (no relationship to the present-day entity of the same name), and in 1907, Muscatine Savings Bank changed its name to the First Trust and Savings Bank of Muscatine. The year 1933 brought a combining of banking interests into a single operating unit, a new state charter, and a change in name to Central State Bank. From the 1930s through the 1990s the bank operated primarily in the Muscatine trade area and developed a reputation for leadership. It was among the first banks in Iowa to offer a sidewalk/walkup teller with extended hours for customer convenience (1957); the first bank in Muscatine to offer drive-up banking; the first to open an office on the community's north side (Park Avenue Banking Center, 1971) and the first to branch into the south side (Grandview Avenue Banking Center, 1977). It launched the area's first banking affinity group, the Ambassador Club (1988), and it was the first to offer in-store banking (Econofoods, 1990). It was also among the first in the area to offer ATM services, debit cards, online and mobile banking. In 2005, the bank branched beyond Muscatine for the first time, opening an office in Wilton, Iowa. In July, 2013, two affiliate banks, Freedom Security Bank (with locations in Coralville, Iowa and Kalona, Iowa) and West Chester Saving Bank (located in Washington, Iowa) were merged into the organization, but continued to operate under their former names as offices of Central State Bank. On April 1, 2015, the bank's parent company, Muscatine-based Central Bancshares, Inc., acquired Buffalo Prairie State Bank, Buffalo Prairie, Illinois and merged it into the organization, and began operating it under its former name as an office of Central State Bank. On September 1, 2015, Central State Bank changed its name to CBI Bank & Trust and brought all of its banking centers together under a single name, logo and brand. Freedom Security Bank Freedom Security Bank was founded in 1899 as Farmers Savings Bank in Kalona, Iowa. It had a legacy of strong family leadership and commitment to the community through the Skola family, dating back to Fred Skola, Sr.‚Äôs employment with the bank in 1903. Three generations of the family served as President prior to the sale of the institution to Central Bancshares, Inc., in 1994. In 2002, the bank expanded beyond the Kalona market, building a new facility at 1st Avenue and Holiday Road in Coralville, Iowa. It concurrently changed its name to Freedom Security Bank to reflect its broadened scope of operations. In mid-2014, the bank was merged into Central State Bank, Muscatine, Iowa. It continued to operate under its former name, as an office of Central State Bank, until September 1, when all Central State Bank offices were combined under the same name and branding of CBI Bank & Trust. West Chester Savings Bank West Chester Savings Bank was incorporated March 6, 1900 and the organization‚Äôs first building was constructed shortly thereafter in the village of West Chester, Iowa. It opened its doors for its first day of business on July 16, 1900. The bank enjoyed steady growth over the years. A very notable characteristic is that it never closed its doors in the 1930s during the Great Depression. In 1948, controlling interest in the bank was sold to A.R. Wolf, his son Calvin C. Wolf, and son-in-law John Butler. In 1985, Farmers Savings Bank of Kalona purchased a controlling interest from the major stockholders and continued to operate the institution as a separate, independent entity. In 1994, the bank was sold to Central Bancshares, Inc. of Muscatine, Iowa and in 1995, the bank charter was moved to Washington, Iowa, where a temporary bank office was leased while construction began on a 2,500 square foot permanent banking facility, which opened for business in March, 1997. In April, 2002, the West Chester facility was consolidated into Washington Banking Center and in 2005, work was completed a 4,000 square foot addition constructed to accommodate continued growth of the organization. In July, 2014, the bank was merged into Central State Bank, Muscatine, Iowa. It continued to operate under the name West Chester Savings Bank, as an office of Central State Bank, until September 1, 2015, when all Central State Bank offices were combined under the same name and branding of CBI Bank & Trust. Buffalo Prairie State Bank Buffalo Prairie State Bank, located in Buffalo Prairie, Illinois, was chartered in September, 1920. Over the years it developed an excellent reputation serving the banking needs of western Rock Island County, Illinois. Growth was steady and at year- end 2014 total assets were over $71 million. The bank was purchased by Central Bancshares, Inc., on April 1, 2015 and concurrently merged into Central State Bank, Muscatine, Iowa. It continued to operate under its former name, as an office of Central State Bank until September 1, 2015, when all Central State Bank locations were combined under the same name and branding of CBI Bank & Trust. Ownership CBI Bank & Trust is a wholly owned subsidiary of Muscatine-based Central Bancshares, Inc., which also owns F&M; Bank in Galesburg, Illinois.

Most of Kraenzel's work focuses on the people of the Great Plains, covering a range of topics including quality of life, power relations, resource use, and mental health. Kraenzel has been widely published in a variety of professional journals, monographs, research bulletins, special reports, and books in the fields of rural sociology, Great Plains sociology, and natural resource sociology. His best known work, The Great Plains in Transition, describes the challenges of social life and connections to the natural environments in the North American semiarid region located between the 98th meridian and the Rocky Mountains. While Kraenzel may not have been a historian, The Great Plains in Transition has greatly influenced the study of Great Plains history.  Biography  Born in Hebron, North Dakota, Kraenzel grew up on a farm in the countryside of the Northern Great Plains and witnessed first-hand the challenges of rural life and living in the region. Kraenzel attended the University of North Dakota for his undergraduate degree, and continued on to do graduate work at the University of Minnesota, Harvard University, and the University of Wisconsin, where he received his Ph.D in 1935. While at the University of Wisconsin, Kraenzel conducted research under Dr. E. L. Kirkpatrick on a study of relief in relation to rural rehabilitation in the Great Lakes states area of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Upon completion of the study, Kraenzel returned to Wisconsin to act as Coordinator between the Wisconsin Emergency Relief Administration and the Wisconsin College of Agriculture. Kraenzel served as a professor of sociology at Montana State University in Bozeman from 1935 to 1968, and later at the University of Texas at El Paso, from 1968 to 1973. Carl F. Kraenzel died on July 16, 1980, in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  Writings  = Major works = * The Great Plains in Transition. University of Oklahoma Press, 1955. * The Social Cost of Space in the Yonland.

Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, 1971. = Impact on the study of the Great Plains = Kraenzel's work has added greatly to the historical discussion of the Great Plains and its influences. Regionalism and cultural adaptation are two of the important elements of Kraenzel's examination of the Great Plains, where the residents of the Great Plains must reside in the region and develop its needed facilities and institutions in order to cooperate with and become equal to the other regions in the United States. While neither of these two terms are unique to Kraenzel and his study alone, they add to the greater discussion. Kraenzel created his own theory of the study of communities on the Great Plains that focus around two areas: the \\"\\" and the \\"yonland,\\" particularly related to the social and community life of a region. While there is a similarity to the hinterland theory in these terms, Kraenzel insists these terms are separate still as all the plains are hinterland. The \\",\\" according to Kraenzel: > \\"is the more densely settled, often stringlike, area of habitation along the > major avenues of transportation. Generally, this area includes the > railroads, which are frequently paralleled by the major highways, bus > routes, and by the public utilities such as telephone and telegraph lines, > gas lines, and power distribution facilities. Here also, are found the > larger towns and cities and all that they imply--specialized and enlarged > wholesaling and retailing; banking; shipping and processing for livestock > and grain; storage; and specialization in hospital and medical-care > facilities.\\" Kraenzel also states that this area includes high school facilities, colleges or universities, larger churches, and governmental agencies, state and federal. While it shares some commonalities with a core or center in the hinterland theory, that is only half correct. It shares some parts of the core, but on a much smaller scale and often in specialized agricultural ways. Kraenzel termed sutland from the term \\"sutler,\\" which he states, \\"historically was the supply agent at the army post before the day when the army maintained its own supply services.\\" The \\"yonland\\" as defined by Kraenzel is \\"the area 'out yonder,' out of the sutland; the area without adequate services.\\" They are the smaller areas dispersed among the sutland areas. There is also an \\"in- between\\" area defined by Kraenzel as being smaller towns without the major transportation systems and public services of the sutland and a difficulty in finding a sustainable population to maintain smaller services and facilities. Kraenzel's theory of the and yonland is significant because of the role of interdependence it creates. The yonland is dependent upon the for services and the is dependent upon the yonland for materials and resources. The and yonland also produce a social organization trend for the Great Plains of four areas, divided among the two areas: * Yonland ** Open country ** The village as a service station * Sutland ** The town ** The city There is a push-pull factor related to the hinterlands of the Great Plains and the core of large cities on the edge of the Great Plains as well as throughout the country. Kraenzel's examination of the push-pull factor applies to his and yonland theory because of the population fluctuations that emerge, shifting the communities in the sutland. Higher education is a popular example of the pull-factor, where due to the larger colleges and universities being located on the far edges of the plains or outside the region all together. Shopping, entertainment, sports, and cultural events are further example of the push-pull factor as it applies to the /yonland theory because they draw residents of the Great Plains to other cities to take part in what their own communities are too small to support. Today, with the celebration of social and community life, especially on the Great Plains, regionalism and the relationship between the and the yonland are just as important as ever to understanding the inhabitants of the plains.

Local authorities are obliged to arrange a funeral where no arrangements are being made or have been made. Local authorities are permitted to recover the costs of such funerals from the estate of the deceased under the Act. The Guardian reported that the average cost of a public health funeral in 2011 was ¬£950.

District councils are obligated to bury or cremate those who die in their area where no suitable provisions for disposal of the body have been made or are being made. Scotland In Scotland a duty is imposed on local authorities under the National Assistance Act 1948 where the body of a person who has died or been found dead in their area and no suitable arrangements are being made for disposal of the body. A local authority may also arrange a burial or cremation for any person who was in the care of or receiving assistance (as well as children in local authority care) from the authority immediately prior to their death. In both cases a local authority may seek to recover costs from the estate of the deceased. 549 funerals were undertaken in 2015 under the provisions above, costing local authorities approximately ¬£500,000.

History The school was formed by renaming 39 Training School at RAF Spitalgate. After moving from RAF Netheravon, the school became the first flying unit at RAF Little Rissington in August 1938 with Audaxes, Furies, Harts and Ansons as No. 6 Service Flying Training School. It was disbanded by being redesignated No.6 (P)AFU (Pilot-Advanced Flying Unit) on 22 April 1942. From 30 April 1946, 6 FTS was based at RAF Ternhill equipped with North American Harvards, receiving Percival Prentices in late 1948; from July 1953 Percival Provost T.1 piston engine training aircraft replaced both types.Sturtivant, 1997, p. 153 On 24 July 1961 the school moved out to RAF Acklington where it closed again on 30 June 1968.http://www.jetprovostfile.org/operating-units/ Operational Jet Provost T.5 of No.6 Flying Training School in 1977 The School reformed on 1 May 1970 at RAF Finningley, within No. 23 Group RAF as an Air Navigation School (ANS). This was an amalgamation of the Hawker Siddeley Dominie T.1 s of No.1 ANS from RAF Stradishall and the Varsities of No.2 ANS from RAF Gaydon. Low-level navigation training took place on the Jet Provost from August 1970, eventually using the T.5B variant which had extra fuel capacity in the form of wingtip tanks due to the extra fuel burn at low level. This part of the school was known as the Low Level and Air Defence Training Squadron (LLADTS). The Vickers Varsity was phased out in 1976, making No.6 FTS an all-jet school. During the 1960s and 1970s all the RAF's Colleges and Flying Training Schools had their own Jet Provost aerobatics team. One of the less known and publicised display teams was flown by 6 FTS. They flew a team for five seasons between 1962 and 1966 and it was unofficially christened the \\"Cocks O'the North\\". On 14 August 1993, the LLADTS made its final farewell to the Jet Provost in the navigation training role when four aircraft staged a \\"dying swan\\" formation over the airfield. 6 FTS also played host to the Multi-engine Training Squadron (METS) and was responsible for Operational Navigation training of all RAF multi-engine pilots, using twin-turboprop Handley Page Jetstream T1 aircraft. METS was granted the No. 45 (R) Squadron number plate in July 1992 before leaving 6 FTS and moving to 3 FTS at RAF Cranwell in October 1995. The school was disbanded on 31 March 1996 with the closure of RAF Finningley. =Reformation= On 7 September 2015, 6 FTS was reborn, to command and manage the University Air Squadrons and their associated Air Experience Flights located across the UK. This role was transferred from 3 FTS due to the implementation of the Military Flying Training System. The Elementary Flying Training (EFT) in the Royal Air Force and the other services upgraded to the Grob Prefect T.1 in 2017, while the University Air Squadrons and Air Experience Flights will remain on the Tutor T.1. The task of 6 FTS is also to ensure continual recruitment of UAS cadets into the Royal Air Force proper; those who do not join will have a better appreciation for the military, which they will take forward into their careers.

His father was a secondary school teacher,Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 22. and, as such, Winteler received his primary schooling at home, starting around 1855. In 1862, he attended school in Nesslau, canton of St. Gallen. Then, from 1862 to 1866, Winteler attended the Progymnasium in Schiers, canton of Graub√ºnden. Winteler received his Matura, the equivalent of a high school diploma, from the Thurgau Kantonsschule in Frauenfeld, canton of Thurgau.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 388. At university (1866-1875) Winteler studied history and German language from 1866 to 1870 at the University of Z√ºrich, where he received his Diplom (in 1870). He went on to study philology at the University of Jena from 1870 to 1875.

As a teacher The Alte Kantonsschule Aarau, as seen in 2005. Professor Winteler began work as a teacher in the Autumn of 1876 at the Zollikofer school for girls, located in Romanshorn, canton of Thurgau. Then, from 1877 to 1880, he taught at the gymnasium in Burgdorf, canton of Bern. Hethen become the director of the gymnasium in Murten, canton of Fribourg, starting in 1880, but he resigned from his post several years later, in 1884, as a direct result of coming into conflict with the school‚Äôs \\"hardline\\" ultramontanist governors.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 22. For the next twenty-five years of his life, from 1884 to 1909, Winteler would teach Greek and history at the Aargau Kantonsschule.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 388. The Aargau Kantonsschule (Aargau Canton School), located close by to an experimental school that had been created by the educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, was, ‚Äúone of the best- regarded in Switzerland‚Äù.Overbye (2001), p. 12. Like Pestalozzi‚Äôs school, the Aargau Kantonsschule was a welcoming place where the students were, ‚Äúallowed to reach their own conclusions‚Äù.Isaacson (2007), p. 26. Albert Einstein‚Äôs only sister, Maria ‚ÄúMaja‚Äù Winteler-Einstein, once described Winteler‚Äôs school, which her brother had attended in his youth, as having, ‚Äúa deservedly high reputation‚Äù. As such, the school was often attended by foreigners, some of whom had traveled as far away as overseas.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, p. xxii. Friendship with Albert Einstein  =Introduction= In late October of 1895, Winteler met a 16-year-old Albert Einstein when he arrived at the train station in Aarau, the latter having just come from Z√ºrich, a city some 25 miles away.Parker (2003), pp. 44-45. Jost brought Einstein to his new home, called R√∂√üligut,The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, Notes to Doc. 46. which was located right across the street from the Gymnasium where he taught Greek and history, and the Gewerbeschule, or Technical School, that Einstein was due to attend.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 21. However, as Einstein had chosen to be a student of the technical school, and not the gymnasium, he never had an official class with Professor Winteler.Overbye (2001), p. 77. On 26 October 1895, Einstein was enrolled as a third-year pupil at the secondary school; the school year had already started three days earlier.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, Notes to Doc. 9.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 372. Aarau, famously known as the ‚ÄúCity of beautiful Gables‚Äù, was once described by Einstein himself as, ‚Äúan unforgettable oasis in that European oasis, Switzerland‚Äù.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 21. An ‚Äúenchanting village‚Äù, Aarau is located in a ‚Äúmagnificent setting‚Äù near the Jura Mountains and the Aare River.Parker (2003), p. 45. Einstein had had to move to Aarau due to the fact that he had failed the general-education half of the two-part entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Polytechnical School at Z√ºrich, thereby failing the test overall. He had subsequently been advised by the director of the Polytechnic, Albin Herzog, to finish up his education and obtain his Matura at a local secondary school before returning to Z√ºrich to retake the exam the following year. Gustav Maier, a mutual friend to both the Wintelers and the Einsteins, helped to arrange for Einstein to board at Winteler‚Äôs home for a year.Parker (2003), p. 44.Isaacson (2007), p. 38. By this time, Winteler had already boarded several students at his home and was used to such an arrangement.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, Notes to Doc. 9. Einstein‚Äôs younger sister, Maja, would also board with the Wintelers later on, arriving in September of 1899.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 31.Calle (2005), p. 331. She would stay at the Winteler's home for several years, leaving in 1892.Parker (2003), p. 54. It is noted in Barry R. Parker‚Äôs book, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, that Einstein was ‚Äúextremely lucky‚Äù to be taken in by Winteler and his family.Parker (2003), p. 46. Einstein‚Äôs maternal cousin, Robert Koch, was also sent to stay with one of Winteler‚Äôs neighbors, as he and Einstein were to attend the same school at the same time.Parker (2003), p. 45. However, Winteler‚Äôs friend, Gustav Maier, wrote to Winteler on 26 October 1895, and advised him that Koch should be, ‚Äúunder your most immediate supervision,‚Äù and that, if Koch proved too unruly in his new home, he should ‚Äúswap‚Äù rooms with his, ‚Äúmuch more mature‚Äù cousin, Albert. Maier explained that Einstein would kindly, ‚Äúmake this little sacrifice,‚Äù for his cousin‚Äôs sake.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, Doc. 9. But this plan never came to pass. Einstein would remain at Winteler‚Äôs home for the duration of his stay in Aarau.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, Notes to Doc. 9. Winteler's home was so large that Einstein was able to have his own room.Parker (2003), p. 46. Two days later, on 29 October, Albert‚Äôs father, Hermann Einstein, wrote to Winteler to express his gratitude for taking in his son, and praised his hospitality. He wrote: ‚ÄúI have‚Ä¶ high hopes regarding the many intellectual benefits his stay there is going to bring him; the stimulating conversations in your house will also be of special benefit to his knowledge.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, Doc. 11. Hermann looked up to Jost, as he had received a greater education than himself.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 22.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, Doc. 11 and Doc. 14, pp. 10-11. Winteler and Einstein waited to discuss the terms of boarding until after Albert was comfortably settled in his new home.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 22. =Life at Winteler's house= Winteler's former home, as seen in 2007. Right away, Jost, his wife, Pauline, and their seven children made Einstein feel as though he were part of the family; indeed, the seven siblings each treated Einstein as though he were a brother. In time, he developed a deep bond with all of Winteler‚Äôs children.Parker (2003), p. 51. Soon after arriving, Einstein started referring to Winteler and his wife as ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù and ‚ÄúMama‚Äù respectively.Barry R. Parker (2003), p. 46. According to Walter Isaacson‚Äôs book Einstein: His Life and Universe, the Wintelers were, ‚Äúa wonderful family‚Äù, who helped the young, and shy, Einstein to, ‚Äúflower emotionally and open himself to intimacy.‚Äù Albert would sometimes study by himself, but, as Winteler‚Äôs eldest child would later recount, he would, ‚Äúmore often... sit with the family around the table.‚ÄùIsaacson (2007), p. 27. The head of the household, Jost, often lead the family during their frequent post- supper discussions (or ‚Äústimulating conversations‚Äù, as Hermann Einstein once called them), or else would read aloud at the dinner table instead. These debates featured a variety of topics, some controversial. Winteler actively encouraged his children, and Albert, to speak their minds openly and, ‚Äúsay‚Ä¶ whatever they felt, without fear of reprimand.‚ÄùParker (2003), p. 47. Winteler‚Äôs ‚Äúboisterous‚Äù home was also, ‚Äúa place of books, music, [and] parties.‚Äùhttp://movies2.nytimes.com/books/first/o/overbye-einstein.html According to Dennis Overbye, the author of Einstein in Love, Albert, ‚Äúquickly felt more at home in the Winteler household than he ever felt at his own home.‚ÄùOverbye (2001), p. 12. The year before he had been invited to stay with the Wintelers, Albert had had to endure isolation and loneliness from the absence of his parents and little sister, who had relocated to Italy so that his father could start a new electrical business after the old one had failed. He was left behind in M√ºnich, Germany (with a \\"distant relative\\"Eisinger (2016), p. 30.) so that he could finish his studies. While there, he witnessed the demolition of his beloved childhood home just before his family moved to Italy without him.Highfield & Carter (1993), pp. 19-20. This, coupled with the frustration of having to attend a school that he hated, had resulted in a full-out depression for the 15-year-old Einstein.Calle (2005), p. 23. So life at Winteler‚Äôs cheerful and stimulating home naturally provided a welcome change for Einstein, and no doubt improved his mood. Einstein‚Äôs sister herself once wrote in Albert Einstein: A Biographical Sketch, that her brother‚Äôs stay in Aarau with the Winteler family was, ‚Äúone of the best periods of his life.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, p. xxii. =Einstein attends the Alte Kantonsschule Aarau= The young Einstein was favorably impressed by the Alte Kantonsschule Aarau, the school where Winteler was headmaster,Brown (2018), p. 252.Calle (2005), p. 25. and found it much better than the strict Luitpold Gymnasium (now called the Albert- Einstein-Gymnasium M√ºnchen) that he had left behind in Germany. Albert had disdained his former school‚Äôs (and indeed Germany‚Äôs) heavy emphasis on militarism,Calle (2005), p. 24. military parades,Parker (2003), p. 47. and mandatory military service,Isaacson (2007), p. 23. which clashed strongly with his innate pacifist beliefs.Parker (2003), p. 241. Einstein was so wary of his old school‚Äôs ‚Äúphilistine‚ÄùHighfield & Carter (1993), p. 20. and repressive teaching methods that, when he first moved to Aarau, the Aargau Kantonsschule‚Äôs mere close proximity to Germany was enough to stoke his harbored fears that his new school would just be more of the same. However, upon meeting Winteler, Einstein came to realize that he had nothing to worry about.Parker (2003), p. 45. The teaching style of Winteler‚Äôs school was in stark contrast to that of the Luitpold Gymnasium, as Einstein would soon come to see, and thoroughly appreciate, for himself. While the Luitpold Gymnasium was, in Einstein‚Äôs eyes, a ‚Äúfactory of rote learning‚Äù,Overbye (2001), p. 8. the school that Winteler taught at placed value on, ‚Äúfree action and personal responsibility,‚ÄùLacayo, Richard. ‚ÄúBirth of A Beautiful Mind.‚Äù Time. 26 May 2017: 26. Print. instead. As Maja Winteler-Einstein explains:The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, p. xxii. The Kantonsschule Aarau turned out to be Einstein‚Äôs favorite school.Calle (2005), p. 25. =Einstein's first thought experiment= The time Albert Einstein spent in Aarau with the Wintelers was the setting for his very first Gedankenexperiments (or ‚Äúvisualized thought experiments‚ÄùIsaacson (2007), pp. 26-27.) in regards to his (then future) special theory of relativity. As he recounts in his autobiographical notes: =Einstein falls in love with Marie Winteler= A few months after moving into Winteler‚Äôs house, Einstein fell deeply in love with Winteler‚Äôs youngest (and ‚Äúprettiest‚ÄùParker (2003), p. 48.) daughter, Marie.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 48. Marie Winteler was 18-years- old at the time; two years his senior. Jost, as were his wife and Einstein‚Äôs parents, was ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù by the budding romance.Isaacson (2007), p. 28. Marie soon became Albert Einstein‚Äôs first girlfriend; they were already a couple by Christmastime.Isaacson (2007), p. 27.Overbye (2001), p. 14. Albert and Marie enjoyed playing the piano together; however, in a large household of ten people, it was a challenge for them to have any privacy.Parker (2003), p. 48. On 21 December 1895, Winteler would inform his ‚Äúdear friend‚Äù, Gustav Maier, by letter that he believed that Einstein and his cousin had, ‚Äúcome to the right place‚Äù. At the time Winteler wrote this letter, Einstein had been living at his home for about two months. =Christmas of 1895= Einstein elected to stay with the Wintelers for the Christmas holidays of 1895, instead of returning back home to his own family in Pavia, Italy.Parker (2003), p. 51. His parents both wrote to Winteler and his family on 30 December 1895, thanking them for their Christmas greetings, and for taking such good care of their son. In her holiday greetings to the Winteler family, Einstein‚Äôs mother, Pauline Einstein (n√©e Koch), expressed that she was ‚Äúhappy‚Äù and ‚Äúrelieved‚Äù to know that Albert was, ‚Äúunder such exquisite care.‚Äù She also thanked Marie, Albert‚Äôs new girlfriend, for writing to her. Einstein‚Äôs father‚Äôs words to Winteler shared a similarly optimistic tone. He wrote: Hermann was also ‚Äúexceedingly pleased‚Äù that Winteler had expressed a positive view of his son. Towards the end of his letter, Einstein made mention that he was returning Albert‚Äôs report card that a concerned Jost had forwarded to him;Parker (2003), p. 51. he was not too worried about his son‚Äôs grades, which he knew would get better in time, for he was used to seeing, ‚Äúnot-so-good grades along with very good ones.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, Doc. 14. Einstein Studying in Winteler's constantly busy home was apparently not an issue for the budding genius, for, as his sister later remembered: =Spring break and graduation (April - October 1896)= The graduation certificate that Einstein earned at age 17, which displays his final grades from the Aargau Kantonsschule (the scale is 1-6, with 6 being the highest grade possible). On 8 April 1896, the school year came to an end, and Einstein left Winteler‚Äôs house to return home to Italy for spring break.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 22. In the letter he wrote to Winteler‚Äôs wife on 14 July 1896, as he was visiting his parents and younger sister in Pavia, Einstein complimented Winteler‚Äôs abilities as a poet, after having read Winteler‚Äôs Tycho Pantander (1890), a collection of poems that had been published in book form. Of the book, Einstein said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already been reading a lot from Pantander, my parents are enthralled by it. Papa finds that this coupling of good emotion and powerful thoughts reminds him vividly of Heine, who is his favorite poet.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 15, p. 10. Tycho Pantander, eine Geistesentwicklung in Liedern (1890), Winteler‚Äôs book of poetry, was dedicated to his ‚Äúdear friend‚Äù, L√©on Bachelin.Winteler (1890), p. ix. Jost‚Äôs daughter and Albert exchanged numerous, and passionate, love letters during this time that Albert was in Pavia for spring break.Parker (2003), p. 52. School in Aarau resumed on 29 April, and Einstein returned, once again, to Winteler‚Äôs house.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 22. The dedication of the Alte Kantonsschule Aarau's new three-story science building took place on 26 April 1896, which Einstein attended. The ceremony was held outside, and August Tuschmidt gave a speech about, \\"the value of education and the higher principles of life.\\"Parker (2003), p. 52. On 3 October 1896, Einstein received his graduation certificate (Maturit√§tszeugnis) from the Aargau Kantonsschule.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 8. He then left Winteler‚Äôs home in mid-October and headed for his future university in Z√ºrich.Parker (2003), p. 57.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, p. xxii. His stay at Winteler‚Äôs home had successfully fulfilled its purpose. After having studied those general education subjects (i.e. literary history, political history, natural sciences, and GermanParker (2003), p. 44.) that he had been remiss in back in early 1895, Einstein passed all of his leaving exams (though he quite nearly failed French), and graduated from the Alte Kantonsschule Aarau. As promised, this meant that he was let into the Z√ºrich Polytechnic without having to retake the entrance exam.Brian (2005), p. 17. =Einstein breaks up with Marie Winteler (May 1897)= Just as they had done while Einstein had been visiting his family in Italy, Einstein and Marie kept in contact by writing a series of letters to one another.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, English translation, Docs. 18, 29, and 30. However, his affection for Marie was starting to cool off.,Parker (2003), p. 53. After having put off the decision for some time, Albert officially broke up with Jost‚Äôs daughter in May of 1897. When he finally wrote to Winteler‚Äôs wife (instead of Marie herself) to end their relationship for good, Albert cited his rationale for the breakup as a desire to devote more of his time to his ‚Äúintellectual work‚Äù (i.e. his ‚Äústrict angels‚Äù).The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 32. While this was true, it must also be noted that, by the time Albert had broken off romantic relations with Marie, he had already met and befriended his future wife, Mileva Mariƒá, who was, ‚Äúthe only woman in Einstein‚Äôs section of the Polytechnic.‚ÄùIsaacson (2007), pp. 41-42.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 31. The breakup, which left Marie both heartbroken and vulnerable, placed an inevitable emotional strain on Einstein‚Äôs familial relationship with the Wintelers. At one point, the tension became so great that a family friend believed that it would be for the best not to mention Einstein‚Äôs name to the Wintelers. Einstein was also upset as he believed that the Wintelers thought that he was, \\"living a life of debauchery.\\"Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 31. Yet, despite this, the loving friendship between Jost Winteler, his family, and Einstein would never completely sever. The Winteler and Einstein families would, ‚Äúlong remain entwined‚Äù. Paul Winteler, Jost‚Äôs youngest child, would go on to marry Einstein‚Äôs sister, and Anna Winteler, Winteler's eldest, eventually married Einstein‚Äôs best friend, Michele Besso.Isaacson (2007), p. 27. With his sister's marriage to Winteler's son, Einstein, \\"truly [became] a member of the Winteler family.\\"Herneck (2016), p. 31. =Lasting friendship with Einstein (1901-1929)= Winteler and Einstein continued to correspond with each other long after the latter had left Aarau. In 1901, about four years after Einstein left Winteler‚Äôs house, Jost even went so far as to assist Albert, who, at the time, was desperate for work, in searching for a job.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Einstein After hearing of a vacant position at the Burgdorf Technikum, Winteler informed Albert‚Äôs parents about it. Although Einstein didn‚Äôt get the job in question, he appreciated his mentor‚Äôs thoughtfulness. Writing to Winteler on 8 July 1901, he said: Einstein explained to Winteler that, immediately after having received his parent‚Äôs letter, he had written directly to the director of the Burgdorf Technikum to apply for a teaching job. He informed the director that his former teachers at the Aargau Kantonsschule could give their opinions on his character and conduct. Einstein also explicitly indicated to the Burgdorf Technikum‚Äôs director that he and Jost were ‚Äúpersonal friends‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt want to put his friend in the ‚Äúawkward‚Äù position of having to give an ‚Äúobjective judgment‚Äù about him; he noted: ‚Äúin this way you can easily refrain from giving an opinion if this seems more appropriate to you.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 177. The now 22-year-old Einstein also shared with Jost that he was ‚Äúexceptionally pleased‚Äù with teaching and that it had ‚Äúnever occurred to him before that he would enjoy it so much‚Äù.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 177. Evidently, Professor Winteler was one of four teachers (the other three being August Tuchschmidt, Friedrich M√ºhlberg, and Heinrich Ganter) who had inspired Einstein to become a teacher himself.Parker (2003), p. 49. Albert Einstein found in Professor Winteler both an ‚Äúally‚ÄùParker (2003), p. 47. and a trusted confident; someone he could turn to whenever he needed to, ‚Äú[vent] his frustration,‚Äù or, ‚Äúget something off his chest‚Äù.Isaacson (2007), p. 69.Parker (2003), p. 47. For example, in a letter written on 8 July 1901, Albert confided to Jost that he had been infuriated by Paul Drude, a German professor and editor of Annalen der Physik, a scientific journal on physics. He had sent a letter to Drude several months before, in June, criticizing two points on his work on electron theory, but Drude had written off both of his criticisms. In response, Einstein vowed to Winteler that he would, ‚Äúsoon make it hot for the man,‚Äù by writing a critical article about Drude. However, he never came through on this particular threat. Einstein signed off this very same letter with what would become one of his most famous sayings: ‚ÄúUnthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 177.Einstein & Calaprice (2013), p. 161. In his 7 February 1907 note to Jost, Einstein addressed his friend as, ‚ÄúDear Professor‚Äù. He then mentioned that Michele Besso, who was Winteler‚Äôs son-in-law by his eldest daughter‚Äôs marriage, and Einstein‚Äôs longtime best friend, had ‚Äúprobably‚Äù gone to Trieste. Einstein had come to this conclusion because he had received a postcard that Besso had sent from G√∂schenen. He subsequently thanked Winteler for his, ‚Äúkind letter‚Äù and asked him if he would give notice of his next visit to Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, ‚Äúso that I can look you up‚Äù.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, p. 29. Albert would later inform Jost several years later, in a letter written on 23 June 1913, that Besso had once again gone to Trieste, ‚Äúfor a business meeting‚Äù. It is implied in this letter that Winteler had inquired, in his previous letter, if Besso would know of his youngest son‚Äôs ‚Äúwhereabouts‚Äù. Einstein replied that he doubted that Besso would have the answer to his question, though he added that Rosa would, ‚Äúcertainly be able to give you this information‚Äù. He also encouraged Jost to, ‚Äúdrop in to see me if your path should lead you to Z√ºrich.‚Äù In his letter, Albert referred to Paul Winteler, his and Besso‚Äôs brother-in-law, as ‚ÄúUncle Paul‚Äù in jest.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, p. 339.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, p. 531. On 9 January 1914, Einstein, while visiting with Rosa, again wrote to Jost, saying: ‚ÄúI cannot resist the temptation to send you my kind regards‚Äù. He also promised that he would, ‚Äúgrant myself the pleasure of visiting you,‚Äù sometime before April.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, English translation, p. 375. When Winteler was 77 years old, he received yet another letter from Einstein on 3 October 1924 (coincidentally, the 28th anniversary of Einstein attaining his graduation certificate from the Aargau KantonsschuleThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 8.). Albert shared with his old friend that he was in Lucerne, visiting with Anna and her husband, Michele, whom he described as ‚Äúcheerful company‚Äù. He also nostalgically reminisced on, ‚Äúthose fine, quiet walks near Aarau during which you said so many things to me‚Äù.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 14, English translation, p. 330. =Winteler's political \\"predictions\\"= Einstein remembered his former mentor, and his ‚Äúdistrust of imperial Germany‚Äù, many years later when Germany expanded under Hitler during World War II; a conflict that Winteler, who died in early 1929, had not lived long enough to see for himself.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 388. In a letter to his sister, written on 31 August 1935, Einstein said: ‚ÄúI think often of Papa Winteler and of the prophetic accuracy of his political views.‚ÄùCalaprice & Kennefick & Schulmann (2015), p. 77.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 388. He also, ‚Äúreminded several of his friends about [Jost‚Äôs predictions].‚ÄùParker (2003), p. 47. Personal views Winteler was a liberal whose, ‚Äúpolitical idealism helped to shape Einstein‚Äôs social philosophy.‚Äù Politically, Winteler and Einstein were kindred spirits; they both believed in, ‚Äúworld federalism, internationalism, pacifism, and democratic socialism, with a strong devotion to individual liberty and freedom of expression.‚Äù Winteler and Einstein also shared a mutual distrust of imperial Germany‚Äôs nationalism.Isaacson (2007), p. 27. Winteler encouraged Einstein to consider himself, ‚Äúa citizen of the world,‚ÄùIsaacson (2007), p. and thus may have possibly inspired Einstein to relinquish his German citizenship and become temporarily statelessHerneck (2016), p. 31. (he would remain stateless from 28 January 1896 until 21 February 1901, when he acquired his Swiss citizenship).Calle (2005), p. 24.Calle (2005), p. 344. Jost is said to have possessed an ‚Äúedgy honesty‚Äù,Isaacson (2007) p. 27. and evidently placed great stock in integrity, as he helped his friend, Gustav Maier, to, ‚Äúfound the Swiss branch of the Society for Ethical Culture.‚ÄùIsaacson (2007), p. 38. Personality According to Barry Parker‚Äôs book, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Jost was an ‚Äúeasy-going‚Äù and ‚Äúunusually kind‚Äù person.Parker (2003), p. 21. Parker expanded further on this by saying that: ‚ÄúThe Wintelers had a warmth and openness of heart that marked them out from their cool Swiss neighbors.‚ÄùParker (2003), p. 23. Jost, a loving father and husband, clearly had a deeply passionate relationship with his wife, Pauline (who also went by the nickname, RosaIsaacson (2007), p. 27.), as described by a young Albert Einstein in a letter written to Winteler‚Äôs wife in August of 1896: ‚ÄúI already see little Mama as usual again‚Ä¶ grinning a bit shyly, as if the professor had given her a very tender kiss.‚ÄùThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 15, English translation, Doc 18e. Hans Byland, a school friend of Einstein‚Äôs, once described the Winteler family as being ‚Äúromantically inclined.‚ÄùHighfield & Carter (1993), p. 23. Winteler and his family appreciated those with, ‚Äúa great sense of humor‚Äù. Einstein shared this same, fun-loving sentiment, and would often ‚Äúlaugh heartily‚Äù while in their company.Isaacson (2007), p. 27. Jost, a keen outdoorsman, often took pleasure in organizing kite-flying expeditions and nature hikes that his family and friends (and a few students) would attend regularly.Parker (2003), p. 48. A passionate ornithologist, Winteler quite enjoyed searching for ‚Äúrare birds‚Äù during the outings that he organized. He was also known for the eccentricity of holding conversations with his pet birds.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 23. While Albert Einstein looked up to and respected his ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù Winteler, and found him to be an enduring source of inspiration, he did acknowledge several faults in him; mainly, that he was, ‚Äúa rather self-willed and complicit,‚Äù man. However, these were common complaints that he had with everyone he knew. And, despite once complaining to his first wife, Mileva Mariƒá, that Professor Winteler was, ‚Äúan old schoolmaster, whatever he says‚Äù, Einstein always held Winteler in the highest esteem.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 22. Jost has been described as ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù and ‚Äúdistinguished-looking‚Äù.Overbye (2001), p. 12. Family tragedy (1 November 1906) Jost faced a terrible triple tragedy on 1 November 1906, when his son, Julius, shot and killed his wife and his son-in- law, Ernst Bandi, then committing suicide.Highfield & Carter (1993), pp. 23-24. Julius, who had been working as a merchant ship‚Äôs cook in America,Parker (2003), p. 56. had returned home to Switzerland showing clear signs of severe mental illness. A ‚Äúdistraught‚ÄùCalaprice & Kennefick & Schulmann (2015), p. 77. Albert Einstein, Winteler‚Äôs former houseguest, sent him a letter of condolence on 3 November 1906, in which he expressed his sympathy and deep grief at the loss of life. Einstein wrote: Einstein was living in Bern, a Swiss city 52 miles (or 83 kilometers) from Aarau, at the time the tragedy occurred.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, Doc. 41. Winteler believed that his son had inherited his mental illness from his wife‚Äôs side of the family.Highfield & Carter (1993), p. 24. Later life Jost had at least five grandchildren, including Vero Besso (1898-1971), the son of his eldest daughter, Anna, and her husband, Michele Besso,The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol.1, p. 378. Benvenuto (1905-1926) and Ernst (1907-1991),The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, p. 592. by his middle daughter, Rosa, and her husband, Ernst Bandi (18??-1906),The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 8, Part A, p. 10. and Paul Albert (b. 8 August 1912The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 5, p. 438.-?) and Heinz (1915-?)The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 22. by his youngest daughter, Marie, and her husband, Albert M√ºller (1887-?).The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 424.

Jost started losing his voice in 1909. In this same year, he began work as a part-time religious instructor. He retired from teaching in the spring of 1914 and moved to Krummenau, canton of St. Gallen.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 388. Death Jost Winteler died at the age of 82 on 23 February 1929, in Wattwil, canton of St. Gallen.The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Vol. 1, p. 388. Legacy \\"In this house lived 1895/96 as a cantonal student Albert Einstein 1879-1955 The famous physicist\\" Winteler‚Äôs former home in Aarau, which still stands today, bears a commemorative plaque that reads: ‚ÄòIn this house lived 1895/96 as a cantonal student Albert Einstein 1879-1955 The famous physicist‚Äô. The Albert- Einstein-Haus in 1895. In 2006, a building at the Alte Kantonsschule Aarau, which was originally named after physicist August Tuchschmid (1855-1939), was renamed ‚ÄòAlbert-Einstein-Haus‚Äô (or Albert Einstein House) in honor of Winteler‚Äôs former houseguest. In popular culture Jost Winteler was portrayed by actor Nicholas Rowe as a recurring character on National Geographic‚Äôs first scripted series,https://deadline.com/2016/04/national- geographic-channel-scripted-series-genius-anthology-ron-howard- direct-1201745935/ Genius (2017).

It features an early use of the name America. The map incorporates information from the travels of Amerigo Vespucci, published in 1503 and 1505. Additionally, the map accurately shows the Arctic as an ocean and Antarctica as a continent of about the correct size. The likelihood that the map, found among Leonardo da Vinci's papers preserved in Windsor, was drawn by Leonardo himself has not been completely accepted by scholars.Muntz, p. 317. According to Major, who published the map in 1865 and defended its authenticity, the date indicated would be doubtful also because Florida is drawn as an island with the name of TERRA FLORIDA, while in maps Cosa 1500 and the Cantino of 1502 it appears as a peninsula, whence Major deduced that it should be earlier than 1514. In fact Ferdinand Columbus mentions the Island before 1492 \\"and upon returning they found the island of flowers ..\\"  Description  Da Vinci developed the concept of dividing the surface of the globe into eight spherical equilateral triangles, each section bounded by the Equator and two meridians separate by 90¬∞. This was the first map of this type. Some critics believe that the existing map was not really an autograph work, since the precision and expertise in the drawing does not reflect the usual high standards of da Vinci. They suggest that it was probably done by a trusted employee or copyist at Leonardo's workshop. Da Vinci's authorship would be demonstrated by Christopher Tyler in his paper entitled \\"Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs World Map\\", in which he provides examples of derivative maps in a similar projection to da Vinci's. The map was originally documented by R. H. Major in his work Memoir on a mappemonde by Leonardo da Vinci, the earliest map Being Known hitherto container containing the name of America Grothe. The eight triangles are configured as two four-leaf clovers side by side, with the earth poles in the center of each clove. One of the sides of the eight triangles (the one opposite the center of the pseudo clover), forms one fourth of the equator, the remaining two (those that converge to the center of the pseudo clover) forming the two meridians that, combined with the equator, dissect the globe into eight octants. The name of \\"Florida\\" (Terra Florida), correctly placed opposite Cuba although in form of \\"an island\\", was probably used for the first time on Leonardo's globe, one year after Ponce de Leon's expedition to Florida. Authorship Leonardo's map authorship it is not universally accepted, with some authors being completely against any minimal contribution from him, either in the map or in the type of projection used; among them, Henry Harrisse (1892), or Eug√®ne M√ºntz (1899 - citing Harrisse authority from 1892). Other scholars explicitly accept the authorship of both (map and projection:\\"..the eight of a supposed globe represented in a plane..\\"), completely as Leonardo's work, describing the octant projection as the first of this type, among them, R. H. Major (1865) in his work Memoir on a mappemonde by Leonardo da Vinci, being the earliest map hitherto known containing the name of America, Grothe, the \\"Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana\\" (1934), Snyder in his book Flattening the Earth (1993), Christopher Tyler in his paper (2014) Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs World Map, Jos√© Luis Espejo in his book (2012) Los mensajes ocultos de Leonardo Da Vinci, or David Bower in his work (2012) The unusual projection for one of John Dee's maps of 1580.. Others also accept explicitly the authorship of both (the map and its projection) as authentic, although leaving open the question of Leonardo's direct hand, giving the authorship of the work to one of his disciples as Nordenski√∂ld states in his book Facsimile-Atlas (1889) confirmed by Dutton (1995) and many others: \\"..on account of the remarkable projection..not by Leonardo himself, but by some ignorant clerk.\\", or Keunig (1955) being more precise: \\"..by one of his followers at his direction..\\"..

She was the first woman named a field demonstration agent by the United States Department of Agriculture, and later occupied high-level positions supporting the New Deal. Life and career Agnew was born at the family home, Roseland, in Prince Edward County, Virginia, ninth of ten children born to Dr. James Anderson Agnew and Martha Chaffin Scott Agnew. The house soon burned, and the family moved to Burkeville, in neighboring Nottoway County. There her mother died after giving birth to another daughter, Anne Virginia, known as \\"Jean\\". Dr. Agnew married again, to Elizabeth McLean, who would raise Ella after the doctor died in 1879.

The following year she migrated to South Africa, where she had accepted a position teaching business and working as a secretary in Paarl, at the Huguenot Seminary. She would stay in South Africa for five years, until the Boer War necessitated her return to the United States. For two of those years she was principal of the Amajuba Seminary in Wakkerstroom. After this was closed by the war, she spent time providing assistance to the Boers and doing clerical and administrative work at the American consulate. During her time in South Africa Agnew also became involved in the student Christian movement. Agnew continued her professional life upon her return from Africa; she worked as a teacher in Virginia, an office manager in New York, and general secretary of a number of Young Women's Christian Association chapters. She also continued her education via correspondence courses during this time. She returned to Virginia to begin a system of professional training for rural girls; supported by the state superintendent of education, Joseph D. Eggleston, and agriculturist Seaman A. Knapp, she began implementing her ideas in 1910 in Nansemond and Halifax Counties with the creation of tomato and canning clubs. She was soon named the first female home demonstration agent in the country. her role has been described as a precursor to modern 4-H and Extension Homemaker clubs.

In 1919 she was named the first president of the Virginia Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. After ten years in the position she left to work for the YWCA's national board, as a member of the finance department, in which role she traveled the country raising money and developing plans to fund local YWCM chapters. In 1927 she took a job as the first female editor of the \\"Women's Department\\" of Southern Planter magazine, remaining there until 1931. From 1933 until 1943 she headed New Deal relief activities for women in Virginia for both the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and the Works Progress Administration; she was instrumental in developing programs which allowed women to contribute to various New Deal programs, even though she was unable to persuade the Civilian Conservation Corps to develop female-only camps. Women under her purview were hired to build bird and wildflower sanctuaries, and she created \\"sewing rooms\\" where women, black and white, could make clothes for the needy or costumes for pageants and National Park Service reenactors. At the disbanding of the WPA in 1943 she retired, but continued in civic life. Agnew died in Richmond in 1958, and is buried at the Sunset Hill Cemetery in Burkeville.

L. adj. brevis, short; Gr. n. nema, thread; N.L. neut. n. Brevinema, a short thread.) (an.derso'ni.i. N.L. gen. n. andersonii, of Anderson), named for John F. Anderson, who first described the organism. This organism is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic, helical shaped, chemoorganotrophic organism from the genus Brevinema. Brevinema andersonii is host associated, strains have been isolated from blood and other tissues of short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) and white-footed mice (Peromyscus Zeucopus) and are infectious for laboratory mice and Syrian hamsters.B. andersonii is readily identified by restriction enzyme analysis, and SDS-PAGE, or fatty acid composition data. Another identifier for B. andersonii is the sheathed periplasmic flagella in the 1-2-1 configuration. While cells are visible by dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy, they cannot be seen when bright-field microscopy is used.  History  Brevinema andersonii was first identified in 1987 by Anderson F. John, Russell C. Johnson, Louis A.Magnarell, Fred W. Hyde, and Theodore G Andreadis in blood and tissues from Blarina brevicauda (short-tailed shrew) and Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse). Initially thought to be associated with Borrelia burgdorferi this organism was finally brought to light with more advanced growth mediums. Upon electron microscopy of cultures from this medium, a distinct morphology stood out from the rest. It was not until 1995 that a push for this organism to be found as a new species. This push came as an article from the Journal of Systematic Bacteriology that exclaimed data supports this organism to be its own genus species was broadcast. Written by D.L. Defosse, R. C. Johnson, B. J. Paster, F. E. Dewhirst, they found genomic evidence to support their claim that Brevienma andersonii was its own deep rooted spirochete. Their findings showed that this organism was around 75% similar in genome to other known spirochetes, this showed that B. andersonii was in a taxon of its own.  Biology and Biochemistry  thumb = Type and Morphology = B. andersonii stains as G- due to the peptidoglycan in the triple-layered outer membrane. Its metabolism is chemoorganotrophic. The organism exists in microaerophilic environments. B. andersonii is a motile and flexible helical shaped spiral bacteria that possess a triple-layered outer envelope. Between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer there is a single sheathed flagella in the 1-2-1 configuration, as well as a protoplasmic cylinder. The cells are usually 0.2‚Äì0.3Œºm in diameter and 4-5Œºm in length. 1‚Äì2 waves occur along the cell with wavelengths of 2-3Œºm. The typical final density of the cells are around 4x10‚àí7 cells per milliliter. = Biochemistry = thumb Brevinema andersonii can be readily identified by enzyme analysis and SDS-PAGE, or fatty acid composition data. An enzyme analysis of B. andersonii showed activity with butyrate, valerate, caproate, caprylate, nonanoate, caprate, esterase lipase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and Œ≤-glucuronidase. The fatty acid composition mainly consists of myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), and oleic acid (18:l), and smaller amounts of stearic acid (18:1) and linoleic acid (18:2). There were low levels, less than 1%, of other fatty acids detected. B. andersonii was found to be catalase negative. thumb = Growth = Brevenima andersonii was found to be grown successfully on a modified BSK medium, referred to as shrew-mouse spirochete medium. The optimum temperature range that B. andersonii grows at is between 30 ¬∞C to 34 ¬∞C, but B. andersonii cannot grow below 25 ¬∞C. The ideal pH for B. andersonii is neutral with an optimum pH of 7.4. It takes 11 to 14 hours per generation time at optimum conditions.  Genome  The type strain of Brevinema andersonii was designated as ATCC 43811. The G+C content of this organism was fount t be 34 mol%. Unique single-base nucleotide signatures at positions 52‚Ä¢359 (G‚Ä¢C) and 783‚Ä¢799 (U‚Ä¢A) differentiate B. andersonii from other major spirochete groups.

Hartford Electric Light Company of Hartford, Connecticut, realized an extra demand for electricity in 1900 and decided in 1901 to purchase this steam turbine generator. The turbine, built by Westinghouse and rated at 1.5 megawatts, ran at Hartford Electric's Pearl Street plant from 1901 to 1905.  History  Connecticut was prosperous at the beginning of the twentieth century. This attracted large populations of people. Many industries developed and needed electricity (whose original use was solely lighting) to run their machinery. Hartford Electric Light Company of Hartford, Connecticut, realizing this extra demand for electricity decided in 1900 to install a massive three thousand horsepower machine to generate this huge amount of electricity that was needed.  Description  \\"Mary-Ann\\" ‚Äì 1901 steam turbine internal parts Hartford Electric Light Company (HELCO) ordered in January 1901 a Westinghouse-Parsons type steam turbine built by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The steam turbine weighed over ninety-thousand pounds so a specifically designed railcar was built to transport it. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad shipped the steam turbine. Their steam plant at Pearl Street housed the 45-ton Westinghouse unit that was about 7 feet high and about 7 feet in width. The massive electric generating machine was nicknamed \\"Mary-Ann\\". HELCO put the steam turbine into the powerplant in April 1901. It ran at 1,200 rpm, turning a generator that produced two-phase alternating current at 60 Hz and 2,400 V. The steam turbine electric generator performed as expected, but did have some difficulties at the beginning of installation. These problems were not entirely unexpected because there was no testing of the unit before shipment. Technology was not advanced enough and the manufacturer had no way of fully loading the machine for a thorough test before shipping. One of the troubles that developed when the turbine was in operation was with lubrication. The mechanism around the turbine shaft leaked some oil and came in contact with steam which impaired its lubricating ability. Another problem that came up because there was no testing at the manufacturer's shop was concerning thrust. The design of the huge turbine allowed for ease of dismantling, however this design flaw caused an unevenness of temperature under the superheated steam which made for poor performance. These flaws were redesigned and eventually corrected for satisfactory operation. \\"Mary-Ann\\" produced 80,000 kilowatt-hours during the first year, 429,000 kilowatt-hours during the second year, 616,000 kilowatt- hours during the third year, and nearly 2,500,000 kilowatt-hours during the fourth year. The steam turbine electric generator was moved to their Dutch Point plant in 1905. Another problem was that the design of the steam turbine required the complete water supply of the Connecticut River that came into Hartford. To solve that problem three cooling towers were built to capture the steam of the turbine and condense it back to liquid water that could be used again. This way the same water could be used over and over again for about a year. Hartford Electric Light Company first ordered the steam turbine on January 1st and started installation on April 1. On October 5th it was in full operation to generate the electricity needed for the city of Hartford and surrounding area. It was the first company in America to use a steam turbine for a public utility to generate electricity. \\"Mary-Ann\\" ran 84 hours during the first year, 555 hours during the second year, 721 hours during the third year, and 2,173 hours during the fourth year. The steam turbine electric generator was nominally rated at 1,500 kilowatts, but did have a maximum capacity of 1,900 kilowatts. The boiler plant had three Aultman-Taylor water- tube boilers, each with a capacity of 550 hp. The condenser was of the barometer type and was manufactured by Worthington Company. The water for condensing purposes was supplied from three cooling towers that had 40 hp direct current motors for the fans. At the beginning the turbine was not in constant service, but usually repairs were required one or two days a week. Many times the blades of the turbine had to be replaced. This went on for two years before the problems were solved. This new technology ultimately replaced the old reciprocating steam engine and was the predecessor of all steam- station turbine electric generators in America today. Hartford Electric Light Company transmitted three-phase alternating current at high voltage in 1893 from an electrical generator similar to \\"Mary-Ann\\". It was from their Rainbow Hydroelectric Station in Windsor, Connecticut to its main station in Hartford ‚Äì some eight miles away.

At the age of eighteen, he moved to America with his family and adopted American nationality, where he studied at the University of South Carolina. He began his academic career at the University of North Carolina, where he taught writing, philosophy, and law, though he was later released from his position due to his support of abolitionism. In following years, he worked as a lawyer in Chicago and New York, before beginning his writing career. According to his biographer Henri Cordier, his early writings are devoted to Hippolyte Taine' and Renan, and the analysis of the metaphysical works of Descartes. Later in his life, he moved back to Paris and turned his studies towards the origins of the modern Americas, a topic to which he was highly devoted. This led to his exploration of records of the discovery of the Americas, and to his amassing of a substantial body of critical and historical works on this subject.

Biography A√≠da Parada Hern√°ndez was born in October 1903 in Linares, Chile to Juan Parada and his wife Margarita Hern√°ndez. She completed her primary and secondary education in Linares and then attended the Talca Normal School between 1919 and 1924, earning a teaching degree. She also founded a school in Linares for adult education. After receiving a master's degree from the Talca Normal School, she taught at her alma mater for 3 years. Then in 1930, she received a fellowship to study at Columbia University in Manhattan and completed both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Arts before returning home to Chile. After the 1928 founding of the (CIM), the women decided to meet every two years, in addition to meeting for the scheduled Pan-American Conferences to foster on-going unity and continuity. As such, the first meeting was held in Havana in 1930. The members were, Flora de Oliveira Lima (Brazil), A√≠da Parada (Chile), Lydia Fern√°ndez (Costa Rica), Elena Mederos de Gonz√°lez (Cuba), Gloria Moya de Jim√©nez (Dominican Republic), Irene de Peyr√© (Guatemala), Margarita Robles de Mendoza (Mexico), Juanita Molina de Fromen (Nicaragua), Clara Gonz√°lez (Panama), Teresa Obregoso de Prevost (Peru), and Doris Stevens (USA).

In 1935, a group of women, who like Parada had studied abroad, got together and founded the Pro-Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women (). Among others, the founders included: Elena Caffarena, Flora Heredia, Evangelina Matte, Graciela Mandujano, A√≠da Parada, Olga Poblete, , , Marta Vergara and Clara Williams de Yunge. Their goals were to address the social prejudices that curtailed women's equality in the labor market and to introduce women's voices into national politics on matters concerning biology, economics, judicial, and political rights for women. Between 1935 and 1952, she was one of the core feminists working with MEMCH and representing Chile at international meetings and conferences. She was teaching at the Pedagogic Institute (now the Metropolitan University of Educational Sciences ) in the faculty of philosophy and education, when in 1947, Parada was named as a Professor of the Department of Technical Assessment at the University of Chile. In 1948, she was briefly married to Le√≥n Cham√∫dez, but they were separated within a year. She continued teaching until her retirement in June, 1973.

It is a Greek Revival structure originally built in 1849-1850 by John McMurtry according to the designs of Thomas Lewinski, the two of whom were some of the most prominent architects in central Kentucky during the nineteenth century. It has been expanded and remodeled several times since, most recently in 1965. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. .  Background  Madison County, named ultimately for the fourth President of the United States, James Madison, was created by the state of Virginia in 1785, and formed one of the nine original counties of Kentucky when the state was admitted to the Federal union in 1792. Richmond became the county seat in 1798, replacing Milford, four miles to the southwest, and was named for Richmond, Virginia, which was the birthplace of John Miller, the veteran of the American Revolution who founded the city. The first formal county courthouse, erected in 1798, consisted of a log cabin with an adjacent jail; before then, county services operated out of Miller's own barn. The following year, the log cabin was replaced by a plain, two-story brick building designed by Tyra Rhodes, which served for the following fifty years. Detail of the cupola Tyra Rhodes' nephew William Rhodes was one of the commissioners charged with procuring plans for construction of a new courthouse in the late 1840s. He sought to retain a reputable architect and hired Major Thomas Lewinski, an English immigrant who had received some formal training as an architect and made a name for himself as a proponent of the Greek Revival style in nearby Lexington. There his commissions included several important residences, including the second house at Ashland (1854‚Äì57) for James B. Clay (son of former U.S. Senator Henry Clay), and he would go on to design several other institutional structures in the region, such as Jacobs Hall at the Kentucky School for the Deaf (1857). McMurtry was himself a well-known designer who also ran his own construction company, often employed by Lewinski for many of his designs. Earlier McMurtry had been apprenticed to Gideon Shryock, the first important architect in central Kentucky, who was responsible for several very prominent Greek Revival structures, including the old Kentucky State Capitol building in Frankfort (1827‚Äì30) and Old Morrison at Transylvania University in Lexington (1830‚Äì34), as well as the first Arkansas state capitol building (1833‚Äì42) in Little Rock. Although he had no further architectural training aside from his employment under Shryock, McMurtry himself designed and constructed the Clark County Courthouse in Winchester, the Transylvania Dormitory and Medical Hall in Lexington, and the Kentucky Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Danville, among numerous other commissions. He is probably best- known today for his associations with the Gothic Revival in central Kentucky at this time.  Original design  Detail of pediment of main portico The courthouse is sited on Richmond's town square, facing Main Street, which runs down a slope past the structure; strangely, therefore, the courthouse is not located at the highest point of downtown. Surrounding Italianate and later Victorian buildings frame the courthouse and permit it to continue to dominate the immediate area, even today. Lewinski's original design called for a cruciform-plan, south-facing two-story structure, which employed a monumental portico supported by four stout Roman Doric columns. The main block extends longitudinally to the north from the portico and rises higher than the two subsidiary wings that are recessed from the portico front and flank it on either side. This allows for the central block to contain the courtroom with its high ceiling on the second floor, a common characteristic in Kentucky courthouse architecture. Each of the subsidiary wings extending to the east and west also originally sported smaller porticoes on their respective ends, removed around 1890, but which originally emphasized the contrast in scale between the central block and the two wings. Undoubtedly, this contrast and the positioning of the courtroom on the second level in the central block referred to the elevated, intellectual activity of courtroom justice and judicial power relative to the mundane, everyday administrative work conducted in offices on the lower levels and in the two wings. Detail of the modillions and cornice on the south fa√ßade Above the central block and in line with the two wings rises a tall octagonal cupola, with four clock faces located respectively on each of the cardinal sides, just above its base. It is marked at each of its eight corners by an engaged Ionic column. Large sash windows punctuate the south fa√ßades and, originally also the east and west ends of the two smaller wings. Today the exterior constitutes the only part of the structure that retains the Greek Revival details. The portico sports a thin two-banded architrave and above that a prominent yet severe frieze of triglyphs separated by bare metopes; an additional bay is allotted for the central intercolumniation. Heavy modillions with guttae adorn the raking cornice and pediment that crown this part of the structure.  Modifications  In the mid-1890s the Cincinnati firm of Crapsey and Brown was retained by Madison County to make extensive alterations, which were previewed in The Inland Architect to cost some $15,000. Among other changes, the remodeling of the interior included the installation of an impressive bronze and marble double staircase inside the main vestibule that still provides access to the courtroom on the second level. It was probably about this time that the small porticoes on the ends of the east and west wings were removed and themselves replaced by large windows. The last significant modifications to the courthouse were made in 1965, which filled in much of the space behind the original wings with a rather unsympathetic and architecturally insignificant expansion of the structure. The interior hallways were mostly covered over with large-plate ceramic tile and dropped ceilings were added. The courtroom has been repeatedly remodeled to accommodate more modern equipment and furnishings. On the exterior, a projecting bay of an added staircase partially hides the pediment and destroys the symmetry originally present on the north fa√ßade opposite the portico.

Chris was named after a sheep character in the sitcom Father Ted (specifically from the episode \\"Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep\\") by local Bonner resident Sue Dowling, who spotted the sheep wandering in a paddock near the Bonner district in Canberra.  Discovery and shearing  Chris was found at Mulligan's Flat near the border of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). His mobility had been impaired as a result of the weight of the fleece he had grown over more than five years. Domestic sheep like Chris raised for their wool have been bred not to lose their coat and need to be shorn regularly, so leaving the sheep unshorn would have put the animal at great risk of infection and/or injury. Four-time Australian Shearing Championship winner Ian Elkins volunteered to shear the massive ram after being contacted by RSPCA Australia. Chris had to be sedated throughout the procedure, during which the shearer removed up to of thick wool after working about 42 minutes. Australian sheep are usually shorn annually and their fleeces usually weigh about . Chris's fleece set a world record, beating previous records held by neglected sheep such as Shrek () and \\"Big Ben\\". Chris's record fleece of was confirmed by Guinness World Records, but the length of the fleece () meant it had no commercial value. It was estimated that Chris's fleece was enough to make 30 jumpers.  Adoption and life at Little Oak Sanctuary  Chris was put up for adoption by the RSPCA, who reported that the sheep needed to recover from his operation and adjust to a life without a \\"cumbersome blanket of wool\\", although his hind legs may have suffered some permanent imbalance from years of bearing the extra weight. Hundreds of people offered to adopt Chris but in September 2015 he was adopted by the Little Oak Sanctuary in New South Wales, where he gradually became more confident with people. The co-founder of the sanctuary reported that he liked having his head scratched.  Death and legacy  Chris died of natural causes aged 9 on 22 October 2019. In 2016, Chris's complete fleece, measuring long by wide, was acquired by the National Museum of Australia, where it was put on display and has become a popular exhibit. A children's picture book about Chris's life after he was separated from his flock and before he was rescued was written by the RSPCA and illustrated by Kylie Fogarty. Entitled The Misadventures of Chris the Sheep, the story offered young readers a possible explanation for why he grew so big. The book was an effort \\"to educate children about animal welfare\\" and proceeds from its sale went to help the RSPCA in the ACT to continue its work protecting, rescuing, caring and advocating for animals in need.

Background Ethiopia is the oldest independent and second most-populous country in Africa. A projection from the 2007 census, it has a total of 90 million inhabitants in 2015 (CSA 2015). The sex ratio between male and female is almost equal; women in the reproductive age group constitute 23.4% of the population. The total fertility rate declined from 5.5 in 2000 to 4.1 in 2014.a 69% reduction according to UN estimates General health status in Ethiopia The average life expectancy for an Ethiopian has increased from 45 years in 1990 to 64 years in 2014, which is higher than the African average (58 years) but lower than the global average of 70 years. This makes Ethiopia one of the six countries that made top individual gains since 1990. The achievement is attributed to the dramatic drop in the under five mortality (U5MR) and an improvement in other socio- economic determinants of health. The U5MR has dropped from 204/1000 live births in 1990 to 64/1000 live births in 2013, the target for achieving MDG4 being 67/1000 live births. Thus Ethiopian has achieved the MDG 4 by the year 2013 well ahead of the proposed time for 2015. Women‚Äôs status in Ethiopia In Ethiopia, women of reproductive age constitute about a quarter of the entire population of 90 million. Around 80% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture, and 84% live in rural parts of the country. Poverty is multidimensional, and its impact is different on men and women. 43% of rural women aged 10 years and above are economically active, mostly in agriculture. * Women in Ethiopia highly contribute for the development of livestock production. But they have very little control on the income. According to the federal civil service commission report in 2005, only 33% of the civil servants were women and 98.2% of women employees were working in lower position. At federal level only 13% of the women were at professional level. In the Informal sector, however, 64.93% are women concentrated in a low paying job. * Women in Ethiopia are engaged with the triple role of production, reproduction and household duties. On an average a rural woman will spend 15 ‚Äì 18 hours a day on agricultural and domestic activities. * Eleven percent of women are married to a man with more than one wife and Sixty-three percent of women in Ethiopia are married by age 18, compared with just 14% of men Gender difference on age at first sex‚Ä¢ 62% women and 18% of men age 25-49 were sexually active by the age of 18, i.e., Women start sexual activity about four and a half years earlier than men (median age of 16.6 years for women and 21.2 years for men) Maternal health Good progress has been registered in maternal mortality reduction, a 69% reduction according to UN estimates from the 1400/100000 live births in 1990 to 420/100,000 live births in 2013. Maternal wellbeing is crucial for the nations development. Majority of maternal deaths occur in the peripartum period. Deliveries attended by a skilled health care provider were shown to improve both maternal and neonatal survival. In Ethiopian most of the deliveries occur at home and unattended by skilled providerSkilled birth attendance and Maternal Mortality trend in Ethiopia Women and HIV HIV Sero ‚Äì prevalence in adults aged between 15‚Äì49 years in Ethiopia is estimated at 1.5% [5.5% urban, 0.7% rural]. However, the prevalence in women is about double than the prevalence in men, 1.9% versus 1%, respectively.  Harmful traditional practices  Seventy four percent of women had a FGM out of which, 6% have their vaginas sewn closed. Around 8% of all marriages occur after through abduction. Violence against women The most common forms of violence against women in Ethiopia include physical violence (intimate partner violence) and sexual violence. A study done in Kofele, (Oromia region, Arsi, Ethiopia) in 2004 showed the lifetime and the 12 months prevalence of physical violence among married women was 64% and 55%, respectively. Another study performed in North-west Ethiopia (Dabat High school) in 2005 revealed that sexual harassment was seen in 44% of the students and rape was experienced by 33.3% of sexually active students. At the tertiary level of education the sexual violence was also alarmingly high as this was also confirmed by a study conducted at Addis Ababa University in 2004 on more than 600 students, where sexual harassment was experienced by 58% in life time and 41.8% in the last one year, rape was experienced by 12.7% of the students, and 27.5% of the student had escaped an attempted rape.

His publication appears with the name Leopoldo Soto or L. Soto. He works at the Comisi√≥n Chilena de Energ√≠a Nuclear where he founded the Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion Laboratory. His main contributions are in experimental physics (plasma physics in particular). The group that he created and leads is a pioneer in the miniaturization of dense plasma focus devices which can reproduce, on a scale basis, similar physics as the ones obtained in large devices which are only available in large laboratories of the world. Due to Soto¬¥s contributions, it is possible to develop relevant research in dense transient plasmas using small devices. He received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Physics in 1989, 1990 and 1993, respectively, from the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. His Ph.D. thesis was advised by Hern√°n Chuaqui. His Ph.D. was the first to be granted by a Chilean University for a thesis in experimental physics. The results of his thesis were published in the journal Physical Review Letters, being this the first time an article in experimental plasma physics produced in Chile was accepted in that prestigious journal. When he arrived at the Comisi√≥n Chilena de Energ√≠a Nuclear, he started to work in plasmas driven by small transient electrical discharges and small pulsed power devices: z-pinch, capillary discharges and plasma focus. His work has contributed to understand that it is possible to scale the plasma focus in a wide range of energies and sizes, keeping the same value of ion density, magnetic field, plasma sheath velocity, Alfv√©n speed and the quantity of energy per particle. Therefore, fusion reactions are possible to be obtained in ultra-miniaturized devices (driven by generators of 0.1J for example), as well as they are obtained in bigger devices (driven by generators of 1MJ). However, the stability of the plasma pinch highly depends on the size and energy of the device. A rich plasma phenomenology it has been observed in the table-top plasma focus devices developed by Soto¬¥s group: filamentary structures, toroidal singularities, plasma bursts and plasma jets generations. In addition, possible applications are explored using these kind of small plasma devices: development of portable generator as non-radioactive sources of neutrons and x-rays for field applications, pulsed radiation applied to biological studies, plasma focus as neutron source for nuclear fusion-fission hybrid reactors, and the use of plasma focus devices as plasma accelerators for studies of materials under intense fusion-relevant pulses. In 1990, he received a fellowship for Ph. D. studies from Fundaci√≥n Andes, Chile. In 1999, he was awarded with a Presidential Chair in Science by the President of Chile. In 2007, he was elected as Fellow of the Institute of Physics, UK. He was the President of the Chilean Physical Society for 2 periods, from April 2003 to April 2008 and its Secretary General from April 2013 to April 2015. He has also contributed to the democratization of knowledge by creating the YouTube ‚ÄúCiencia Entretenida‚Äù channel. With the direction of Vanessa Miller and with the participation of professional actors, Daniel Alcaino and Javiera Acevedo, they develop videos to motivate new generations for sciences and to inform to general public, in an entertaining and didactic way.

Information The Strobo Trip toy combines a pulsating strobe light and 24 disks designed by David Bizzaro, Michelle Martin-Coyne, George Salisbury, Daniel Huffman and Dylan Bradaway. The toy creates a stroboscopic effect (similar to a Phenakistoscope) when components are rotating. Most of the discs have geometric psychedelic illustrations, but one of them has drawings of spermatozoa fertilizing ova. The first track, \\"Butterfly, How Long It Takes to Die\\" appeared with a different mix in the 2013 Flaming Lips album The Terror. \\"I Found a Star on the Ground\\" is a 6-hour long song recorded over a period of 3 weeks from August 23 to September 17, 2011.

The box-set was available for purchase only at Jackpot Records (203 SW 9th Ave. Portland OR 97205) on September 20, where Wayne Coyne himself sold 11 boxes to fans. The boxes were available later at other Oklahoma shops, and finally at a later Flaming Lips show. The boxes were sold for $60 to $85.

Early life and career Merriman was born in the town of Somerville in St. Lawrence County, New York to Orramel and Amanda Merriman. He attended local schools and went to college at Gouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, attending his classes in the spring and fall while working as a schoolteacher in the winter and helping with his family farm during the summer. After graduating in 1850, he began to read law under Charles Anthony and was admitted to the bar in 1854. Merriman married Rosannah Herring on April 3, 1854 and the two soon relocated to Janesville, Wisconsin. Merriman entered into a law practice with David Noggle, Amos Pritchard, and John M. Berry. He later moved to Jefferson, Wisconsin and began a law firm with the state's first lieutenant governor John Edwin Holmes. While living in Jefferson, he also became active in local politics and served as the local superintendent of schools, as the clerk of the board of supervisors, and as postmaster. In 1859, Merriman moved to St. Anthony, Minnesota to continue his legal career. Life in Minnesota Just a week before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Merriman was elected the mayor of St. Anthony, Minnesota. After the war began, Merriman worked to ensure the town provided soldiers for the war. He was re-elected in 1862 but left to serve in the 6th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment where he had been named captain. His unit served in the Dakota War of 1862 and was present at the Battle of Birch Coulee and Battle of Wood Lake. In June 1864, Merriman resigned his commission due to poor health. Merriman returned to his legal and political career. He formed a law firm with William Lochren and was re-elected mayor of St. Anthony in 1866 and 1867. In 1864, he was appointed by the state legislature (with John Sargent Pillsbury and John Nicols) to help the University of Minnesota deal with a financial crisis. Merriman became involved in various lumber companies in the area and helped construct a lumber mill on Saint Anthony Falls. In 1875, he was elected mayor of Minneapolis with the support of both parties. In 1881, he helped found the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis. In 1891, he left the lumber business and became involved in banking, working with the Northwestern National Bank and Commercial Bank of Minneapolis. In 1897, he was named a Referee in Bankruptcy.

As of February 1, 2016 the network has over 8.6 million subscribers and 2.4 billion views on YouTube. History and formation =Above Average= Above Average Productions is the digital sector of Lorne Michaels' production company, Broadway Video. Michaels previously formed Above Average Productions during the late 1970s when a series of specials were developed under a production company of the same name. However, the online comedy network that it is known as today was not founded until 2012. In June 2012, Above Average Productions quietly launched after Broadway Video decided to help produce a Web series that Saturday Night Live writer Mike O'Brien had come up with. The series was called 7 Minutes in Heaven and featured Mike O'Brien interviewing celebrities such as Patricia Arquette and Ellen DeGeneres, among others, in a small closet. After production on the series commenced, other members of the Broadway Video family expressed their desire to contribute to the online comedy community. This eagerness from within the company, along with popularity of 7 Minutes in Heaven, prompted Broadway Video to make the decision to officially revive the Above Average brand and form the \\"boutique multi-channel network\\" that Above Average is today. The current president of Above Average is Jennifer Danielson. Above Average Productions is based out of New York City. =The Kicker= In October 2015, Above Average partnered with SNL co-head writer Bryan Tucker to launch a new sports comedy brand, The Kicker with a mantra of \\"For fans. For fun.\\" The Kicker creates original sports comedy videos, articles, images, and digital content that are similar in tone to that of Above Average. The Kicker posts content on its website as well as on its official YouTube channel. Content Above Average Productions creates comedy shorts for mostly online audiences. The style of comedy is typically highbrow and satirical; goofier, lowbrow content is also released occasionally. The company's focus, however isn't only on producing quality content. Above Average gives up-and-coming comedians an opportunity to show off their talents, grow as performers, and to expand their professional networks. Comedians such as Broad City's Ilana Glazer and SNL's Sasheer Zamata were both featured on Above Average before moving onto larger scale television projects. Above Average also collaborates greatly within their many channels, as well as with other branches of Broadway Video, whether it be through sharing actors, writers, or directors. Above Average has also ventured into media other than YouTube, such as Hulu, Yahoo, and international distributors, although YouTube continues to be the production company's main marketing tool. Above Average has also ventured offline in the past, creating an animated pilot for Comedy Central entitled Waco Valley, based on the network's popular web-series about a dinosaur reporter, although the focus of the group remains on creating quality web content. Above Average has also done advertising work in the past, for companies such as Lexus, Oreos, and Mastercard Some of Above Average's channel partners include The Lonely Island, Jay Pharoah, Mike O'Brien of 7 Minutes in Heaven, POYKPAC, Melissa Hunter (creator of Adult Wednesday Addams), Dave and Ethan, Harvard Sailing Team, among others. Above Average is home to 77 original series, such as 7 Minutes in Heaven, Alec Baldwin's Love Ride, Cool Kids' Table, Forgotten Assholes of History, Hudson Valley Ballers, I Wanna Have Your Baby, Is This Okay?, Paulilu Mixtape, Sound Advice, The Idiot's Guide to Smart People, Thingstarter, and Waco Valley.

She is the founder and executive director of Noor Educational and Capacity Development Organization (NECDO). She is also an executive member of the umbrella organization, Afghan Women's Network (AWN).  Biography  As a child, Afghani had polio and because of complications from the disease must use a brace to walk. When she was fourteen, she was shot in the head during the Soviet War. Afghani fled Kabul in the 1990s during the Afghan civil war, settling in Peshawar. Afghani earned a bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Peshawar. Afghani's first job was as a social worker for Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. She also helped women in the camps become literate through Qur'anic education classes. Afghani has stated that one of the greatest barriers to women getting education is a lack of female teachers. In 2001, Afghani founded NECDO, with the goal of helping women and children receive educational opportunities. NECDO also teaches sign language, and has classes about conflict resolution and gender issues. NECDO is known for creating innovative ways to reach out to women and girls. For example, the NECDO created a library for girls, but they recruited boys to bring the girls to visit the library, awarding prizes to the boys for each five girls they brought. Her organization serves around 50,000 women in 22 provinces. Afghani's work directly challenges the misconception that Islam supports violence against women. She created the first \\"gender-sensitive training in Afghanistan for Imams.\\" She started the project by finding interested Imams to look at the information she and others had prepared. The Imams started preaching the new materials, which cover women's rights from an Islamic point of view, right away. In 2015, she had about 6,000 Imams working with the program. In Kabul, her program has \\"resulted in a series of khutbas (Friday sermons) in twenty of the city's influential mosques. Afghani has discovered through her work that \\"women's mouths get shut when they don't have Islamic justifications\\" because Afghan culture is very religious and conservative. Her gender training has had strong effects on men who did not realize that Islam allowed women's rights and has helped turn men into advocates for women. Afghani has said that the \\"program is its own kind of revolution because religious leaders once known for oppressing women now use the words of the Quran to promote fairness for them.\\" She also works to challenge the patriarchal tribal system of government in Afghanistan. She believes that one of the problems with Afghanistan is that the citizens are unable to distinguish the differences between \\"Islam, culture and politics.\\" She states that she has been threatened by some Afghans who are against her teaching and promoting a peaceful interpretation of Islam. Afghani was awarded the Tanenbaum Peacemaker in Action Award in 2008. In 2017 she was among the finalists nominated for the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity.Aurora Prize. 2017 finalists.

He first became prominent in the service of Kit Carson as a fur trapper during the 1830s. After that, he lived among the Nim√≠ipuu, influencing them to mistrust ABCFM missionaries. Throughout 1847, Hill was Alta California fighting in the service of John C. Fr√©mont. Tom Hill returned to Kansas in 1854 to reside among fellow Lenape, where he died in 1860. Several later historians have named Hill as the primary cause of the Whitman Massacre, earning him some notoriety. Early life Tom was born in the vicinity of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, where his family had been granted land by the Federal government in 1817.Treaty with Wyandot, Etc., 1817., September 29, 1817, Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties, Vol. 2, 155. He likely attended the mission school located in Upper Sandusky for an indeterminate period when a minor.

Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1968. p. 55. that also included Joseph Meek and two other Lenapes. The area they operated in was between the Cimarron and Arkansas rivers, then controlled by the Comanche. During their excursion they were met in battle by 200 Comanche warriors, the trappers having to make a protective wall with their mule mounts.Victor, Frances Fuller. The River of the West. Newark, NJ: R. W. Bliss & Co., 1870. pp. 154‚Äì157. After several hours of skirmishing, the Comanche relented with the trappers losing none of their number. The three Lenape men in Carson's employ continued with him, eventually reaching the Yellowstone River in 1837. The group encountered a Niitsitapi village, with a battle ensuing. The previous Lenape officer in charged perished, and Hill was elected to his position.Victor (1870), p. 227. Tom remained with Carson until 1839, operating out of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, at Taos. Time among Nim√≠ipuu Hill then spent several years residing among the Nim√≠ipuu, an ethnic group he had interacted with for several years at the annual Rendezvous. While the Niitsitapi band hunted bison, his leadership in confrontations against Niitsitapi earned him a place of respect and he married a member of the band. The loss of territorial sovereignty among Native Americans east of the Rocky Mountains to the expansionist United States of America was taught by Hill to the Nim√≠ipuu and later the neighboring Liksiyu.Brouillet, J.

In a party of Nim√≠ipuu led Ellis however, Hill visited the Waiilatpu Mission and dined with Marcus and Narcissa Whitman along with the fellow families there in 1845. Tom was to remain at the Mission for about two weeks.

Marshall concluded that \\"...it is doubtful is any other one influence was a potent as Tom Hill in ... bringing on the Whitman massacre.\\" This assessment has been questioned by later historians, with more focus given to the simmering cultural clashes between the Indigenous and the Missionaries along with the spread of infectious diseases on the Columbian Plateau.Drury, Clifford M.

Two years prior, Walla Walla noble Piupiumaksmaks visited the settlement, though his son died in a confrontation there. Piupiumaksmaks wished to return to the area to reaffirm positive relations with John Sutter. Hill and the group entered Alta California during the tumultuous Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Conquest of California then just beginning. John C. Fr√©mont called for volunteers to join in the California Battalion, with several Walla Wallas serving as scouts. Hill enlisted into a white company, his salary being $25 monthly. The military company was headed south towards Monterey when several hundred Mexican forces were encountered at Battle of Natividad. Hill was a part of a small scouting party that encountered the enemy forces, having to fight them unaided for four hours.

It was recorded by four Motown acts: The Temptations, Brenda Holloway, The Four Tops, and The Fantastic Four. The Temptations first recorded in 1965 for the Gordy (Motown) label. Their version would be released as an album track on The Temptin' Temptations. It features a lead by Paul Williams, one of the group's original lead singers who by then had been eclipsed by David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks as lead even on the group's album tracks and A B-sides. Although Williams still recorded several leads, they were often overlooked for release by the label. Williams and the other Temptations constantly complained about not allowing Williams more leads on album tracks, and singles, but Motown paid them no heed. The Andantes were added for additional backing vocals on the track. Brenda Holloway later covered the song in 1966, and the Four Tops in 1967; the Andantes backed both recordings. In the Tops' case, lead singer Levi Stubbs recorded his lead soon after the Tempts completed their version, and the group (with the Andantes) dubbed backing vocals over the Tempts/Andantes original instrumental and vocal backing track. Joining the Andantes as backing vocals on Holloway's version were the Originals, who were signed to label earlier that year. Detroit-based R&B; group The Fantastic Four covered it as a 1969 single on Motown's Soul label, with the Andantes brought in once again to provide additional backing vocals.

Miller qualified for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the 1500m, finishing in seventh place. Personal history Miller was born in Barrow-in-Furness in 1989 to Pat Miller, who competed at national level as a steeple-chaser. Dean Miller, who was born with cerebral palsy, matriculated to the University of Birmingham and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Sport, PE and Coaching Sciences. Sporting history Miller was encouraged to take up athletics by his father, joining his local athletics club at the age of 12. He showed promise as a cross country runner, and entered national events for able-bodied competitors. At 17 he qualified to represent Great Britain at the 2006 IPC Athletics World Championships in Assen, finishing eighth in the T37 800m. This was followed by a disappointing period for Miller as he suffered three separate stress fractures to his foot which saw him miss competing for the majority of 2007 and 2008, which included a potential Paralympic Games. In 2009, Miller was back competing at British meets, mainly in the 800m event. By the next year he had added the 1500m to his repertoire and recorded a personal best that year of 4:27.47. In 2011 he travelled to Dubai to compete in the IWAS World Junior Championships, winning first place in the 1500m and a bronze in the 800m. The next month he was in Germany, where he took second place in the 800m at the German National Paralympic Championships. His results leading up to 2012 saw him selected for the Great Britain team for the Summer Paralympics in London. There he competed in the 1500m T37, finishing seventh with a time of 4:21.57. Miller was back in the Great Britain team the following year, representing his country at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon. He improved on his Paralympic finish by crossing the line in sixth place. 2013 also saw him post a new personal best in the 1500m, 4:18.31 at Loughborough. In 2014 Miller claimed his first major international medal, when he finished third at the IPC European Championships in Swansea in the 1500 m T38, despite it being for athletes deemed less disabled than himself.

The song is in two parts, intended to occupy both sides of a 10-inch 78 rpm record. However, it remained unreleased for many years. Part 2 was included on the 1971 album This Old World's in a Hell of a Fix (Biograph BLP 12027). Both parts were included on a 1980 compilation album of songs by Phillips, Denomination Blues (Agram 2006). The song is unusual in that the verses are separated by a wordless hummed refrain; a similar device to the wordless vocalise which Phillips had used in \\"I Had a Good Father and Mother\\". The song first came to wider notice when Ry Cooder included a version of Part 2, titled \\"Tattler\\", on his 1974 album, Paradise and Lunch (note, however, that Cooder does not label it as \\"Part 2\\"; he also includes two verses from Part 1, which seems to have been unreleased at the time); and when Linda Ronstadt covered that version on her 1976 album, Hasten Down the Wind.

His tenure as CEO of United Airlines began in September 2015. Prior to his role at United Airlines, Munoz served on the board of parent company United Continental Holdings (UCH) and held multiple executive positions at CSX Corporation and AT&T.; In December 2019, Munoz announced that he would transition to the role of executive chairman of the board in May 2020. President Scott Kirby took over the CEO role from Munoz in May 2020 at United's annual meeting. Early life Munoz was born on January 5, 1959, the eldest of nine children in a Mexican-American family from Southern California. He was the first in his family to graduate from college. Munoz earned a BS in business from the University of Southern California in 1982, and an MBA from Pepperdine University. Career Munoz worked for US West for five years, before and briefly after the company merged with Qwest. From 2001 to 2003, he served as the chief financial officer and vice president of consumer services at AT&T.; Munoz was previously regional vice president of finance and administration for Coca-Cola Co. and held various financial positions at PepsiCo Inc. He joined the CSX Corporation in 2003 as chief financial officer and chief of strategy. In 2012, he was promoted to chief operating officer of CSX, a role which he held until 2015, when he was named president of the company. During his tenure as chief operating officer, Munoz was responsible for keeping trains running on time. In mid-2015, Munoz was appointed as the next CEO of CSX, officially starting in the position at the end of the year, but left the company in September to become CEO of United Airlines. He was named CEO of United Airlines on September 8, 2015, succeeding Jeff Smisek. At the time of this appointment, Munoz had served as a member of the board of directors of United's parent company, United Continental Holdings (UCH), since its formation in 2004. After becoming CEO of United Airlines, Munoz embarked on a \\"listening tour\\" of the company, meeting with disgruntled employees around the United States and discussing their concerns. While this phase was intended to last for the first 90 days of the job, Munoz was hospitalized after having a heart attack in October 2015, 38 days into the job. In 2015, five years after the merger of Continental and United, staff remained on separate labor contracts and were only allowed to fly on the routes and planes for the company where they were employed before the merger, causing contentions between management and labor. Under Munoz's tenure, five-year contracts for flight attendants were approved within four months, after years of negotiations. By the end of 2016, all union labor contracts were renegotiated. Although pilots were unable to reach a joint labor agreement in 2012, United agreed to a two-year contract extension with the pilots' union in 2016, under Munoz, allowing pilots to retain some of the pay and benefits that were cut after the September 11 attacks. On August 29, 2016, Munoz hired Scott Kirby, then-president of American Airlines, to fill the same role at United. In 2015, Munoz was one of two Hispanic CEOs in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 list. Munoz has been named among the \\"100 Most Influential Hispanics\\" by Hispanic Business magazine. In March 2017, Munoz was named \\"Communicator of the Year for 2017\\" by PRWeek. The following month, Munoz received widespread criticism for his handling of the issues after a ticketed passenger was forcibly removed from United Airlines Flight 3411. In an email to United employees, Munoz initially stated that he stood behind employees for having \\"followed established procedures\\" and said that Dao was \\"disruptive and belligerent.\\" In a second press release on April 11, which was more sensitive to public opinion, Munoz stated in the press release \\"I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers.\\" Munoz's handling of the incident was described by various critics as a \\"fumbling response,\\" a \\"major disappointment,\\" and a \\"sort of a self-immolation [that] makes you wonder about his choice as CEO.\\" Munoz was already under pressure from activist shareholders to improve United's performance, including its customer relations, after he took charge of the airline in 2015. After the incident, Steve Barrett, editor-in-chief of PRWeek US, stated \\"if PRWeek was choosing its Communicator of the Year now, we would not be awarding it to Oscar Munoz ‚Ä¶ In time, the episode and subsequent response will be quoted in textbooks as an example of how not to respond in a crisis.\\" Subsequently, on April 21, 2017, UCH announced that Munoz would remain chief executive officer of the airlines but would \\"not take broader control of the company as previously planned.\\" Munoz had been scheduled to assume the role of chairman of the board of UCH at the company's 2018 annual stockholders' meeting. In December 2019, it was announced that Munoz will transition to the role of executive chairman of the board in May 2020. President Scott Kirby will take over the CEO role from Munoz in May 2020 at United's annual meeting. Munoz is positioned to serve a one year term as chairman of United Airlines Holdings, succeeding retired Jane Garvey. In addition to serving on the board of directors for Continental Holdings and United Airlines, he has served on University of North Florida's board of trustees and the PAFA advisory board of Vanderbilt University. Personal life Munoz is married; he and his wife have four children. Munoz is also an avid cyclist and has run in marathons. =Philanthropy= In 2011, the couple gave $100,000 to the University of North Florida to fund a scholarship for students who are the first in their family to attend college.The same year, the couple donated $1 million to a middle school in Florida to fund a dropout prevention program. =Health= Munoz suffered a heart attack on October 15, 2015, a month after he assumed the position of CEO of United Airlines. As he awaited a heart transplant, Munoz interviewed candidates for top management jobs in his apartment while connected to machines that kept his heart functioning. On January 5, 2016, he received a heart transplant and returned to work in March 2016. Munoz is one of few CEOs to continue in the position after receiving a heart transplant.

New York: Hip-O Select/Motown/Universal Records Credited to the Darnells the performers on both sides of the single were in fact the Andantes (both sides), Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland (B-side only), Mary Wilson of the Supremes (B-side), and members of the Marvelettes (A-side only), the Four Tops, and the Temptations (both on the B-side). Nobody involved with the production on either side was pleased with the false credit. Whatever the reason it was done, it didn't work as the single only peaked at 17 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts. The song on the A-Side has the narrator the audience of the emotional pain she experiences after seeing her lover kissing and holding another girl across the room (and he didn't notice she was there). The A-Side is now officially considered both a Marvelettes single, and the first of two official singles by the Andantes by the Motown company. Marvelettes lead singer Gladys Horton is the main lead on the song, with her groupmate Wanda Young and Andantes member Louvain Demps on harmony co-lead. For the Marvelettes this recording would be similar to some of their later songs (as wells as songs by the Supremes, the Vandellas, and the Velvelettes), in which the only group members heard on the songs are the ones singing lead. In the Andantes' case Demps' harmony vocals on this song, and her group's backing chime-offs on Mary Wells's \\"My Guy\\" and Marvin Gaye's \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\" and solo speaking lines on Barbara McNair's \\"Fancy Passes\\", would be the closest any member of the group would get to front any recording at Motown; as they would not be allowed to even sing main lead on neither side on this single, nor their follow-up \\"(Like A) Nightmare\\" b/w \\"If You Were Mine\\".

The case essentially operated as a test case for certain key issues in relation to a series of litigation cases relating to swaps entered into between banks and local authorities in the United Kingdom which had been declared to be legally void. Background In June 1987 Welwyn Hatfield District Council had entered into a 10-year interest rate swap agreement with Morgan Grenfell based upon a notional principal amount of ¬£25 million. The swap made the usual provisions for netting, with only the balance due being payable by either party on the payment dates. Welwyn Hatfield DC had also entered into a back-to-back swap with Islington London Borough Council, and Islington LBC was joined to the proceedings as an interested third party. Accordingly, in commercial terms Hatfield Welwyn DC was just acting as an intermediary (for which it effectively received the sum of ¬£210,000) and the net payments would flow through to either Morgan Grenfell or Islington LBC depending upon the movement of interest rates. In 1989 pursuant to the decision at first instance in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [1990] 2 QB 697Ultimately appealed to the House of Lords, reported at [1992] 2 AC 1 it was held that interest rate swaps were not permitted under the Local Government Act 1972, and therefore were ultra vires with respect to the powers of local authorities in the United Kingdom, and were therefore all void. Thereafter all payments under the swap contract stopped. Morgan Grenfell then commenced proceedings against the District Council to claim back the payments which they had previously made under the void swap contract. The court ordered than three issues be determined as preliminary issues. # Firstly, whether the swaps should be characterised as wagering contracts within section 18 of the Gaming Act 1845 or section 1 of the Gaming Act 1892.Now replaced by the Gambling Act 2005. # Secondly, whether section 63 and paragraph 12 of schedule 1 to the Financial Services Act 1986Now superseded by section 412 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. affected that conclusion. # Thirdly, whether any right to restitution arose if the contracts were held to be a wagering contract. Judgment Hobhouse J giving the judgment of the Court, held that an interest rate swap contract had, at least potentially, a speculative character, and was therefore capable of being entered into by two parties for the purposes of wagering on future interest rates. However, he further held that in the context of interest rate swaps entered into by parties or institutions involved in the capital markets and/or the making and receiving of loans, the normal inference was that such contracts were not wagering or gaming, and in the absence of some other consideration, would be given full recognition and effect. The inference would only be rebutted if the purpose and interest of both parties to the transaction was to wager, in which case the contracts would be legally invalid and unenforceable.[1995] 1 All ER 1, at 4A-J. The Court followed the decision of Lord Hanworth MR in Earl Ellesmere v Wallace [1929] 2 Ch 1 at 25 where he held that a contract is void as wagering or gaming contract if it is entered into by the parties for no purpose other than wagering or gaming. He also noted that decision of Leggatt LJ in City Index Ltd v Leslie [1992] QB 98 where the Court of Appeal had previously held that \\"before the 1986 Act came into force, contracts for differences were void, [but] other contracts which were superficially similar were not. These were contracts entered into for a commercial purpose, such as hedging. Such contracts may result in no more than the payment of a difference. But because they were made for a commercial purpose, they are not void as wagering contracts.\\"[1995] 1 All ER 1, at 7C-G. The Court went on to consider section 63 of the Financial Services Act 1986. That section provides: Hobhouse J held that, even if the contract had fallen within the ambit of the Gaming Acts, it would have been a transaction which section 63 of the Financial Services Act 1986 would have applied as it was \\"entered into by way of business\\" since, having regard to the overall activities of the parties, the swap had been a business transaction rather than something personal or casual. Although local authorities were not commercial entities, the Court was satisfied that what they were purportedly trying to do in relation to debt management would be understood in any reasonable terms by the man on the street as the conduct of business.[1995] 1 All ER 1, at 13J. On the third issue the Court noted that the sums paid were already held to be recoverable as money had and received notwithstanding the void nature of the swaps. Would adding an additional layer of invalidity through being a wagering contract have affected that conclusion? The Court noted that in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd [1991] 2 AC 548 that payments pursuant to a gaming contract were considered to be gifts and were not recoverable. However, having touched upon the relevant legal analysis, Hobhouse J abruptly stopping, and stated that having held that the swaps were not gaming or wagering contracts, he was not going to answer the third question on a hypothetical basis.[1995] 1 All ER 1, at 15F. Commentary Academic commentators have noted that \\"[t]he general approach taken by Hobhouse J is welcome, but he, like judges before him, does not offer any real guidance as to what the features of a contract are that make it a wagering transaction.\\" Notes There was no appeal against the decision at first instance. Although the judgment was handed down on 30 April 1993, it was not subsequently reported until 1995, and then only in the All England Law Reports (the case is not reported in any of the official reports).

General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385 (1926), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court expanded and established key constructs of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process doctrine along with establishing the vagueness doctrine. It defined necessary requirements that are fundamental to any law, which, when lacking, are to be deemed void. The case was a dispute regarding Oklahoma state statutes, which, in essence vaguely required businesses to pay workers not less than the \\"current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed\\". The ruling determined that the standards set in place were unconstitutionally vague.  Provisions Rejected by the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court nullified all enforcement of provisions ¬ß¬ß 7255 and 7257, of the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921. The provisions established basic requirements for workers and the rights they were to be prescribed, while working for the state or a company executing a contract for a state, or a subcontractor thereof. # 8-hour day for employees # Necessary payments (min. wage) The statutes together defined each day that the employer violated the provisions, as an additional count of the offense. The offense itself established fines of $50‚Äì500, and imprisonment of 3‚Äì6 months. This form of cumulative punishment made the crime extremely punitive..  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court determined that the sections provided for violation of the 5th amendment rights of the employers, by not specifically defining what was and wasn't punishable; this ruling is particularly famous for furthering the scope of the vagueness doctrine.

The chemical composition of a petroleum distillate can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and aromatic content.Phenix, A. Generic Hydrocarbon Solvents: a Guide to Nomenclature. WAAC Newsletter Volume 29 Number 2 May 2007. http://cool.conservation- us.org/waac/wn/wn29/wn29-2/wn29-204.pdf Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the aromatic content of petroleum distillate solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that \\"To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit.\\" Petroleum spirit is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 ¬∞C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as hydrotreated light petroleum distillates comprising ‚â• 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‚ÄòBenzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P; Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters‚Äô Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.Phenix, A. Generic Hydrocarbon Solvents: a Guide to Nomenclature. WAAC Newsletter Volume 29 Number 2 May 2007. http://cool.conservation- us.org/waac/wn/wn29/wn29-2/wn29-204.pdf According to their corresponding MSDS, most commercially offered petroleum benzine solvents consist of parrafins (alkanes) with chain lengths of C5 to C9 (i.e. n-pentane to n-nonane and their isomers), cycloparaffins (cyclopentane, cyclohexane, ethylcyclopentane, etc.) and aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene, etc.). The TSCA Definition 2008 describes petroleum benzine as \\"a complex combination of hydrocarbons obtained by treating a petroleum fraction with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. It consists of hydrocarbons having carbon numbers predominantly in the range of C4 through C11 and boiling in the range of approximately -20¬∞C to 190¬∞C.\\"  Health concerns  Beginning in the 1960s and 70's, the high incidence rate of polyneuropathy amongst industrial workers chronically exposed to petroleum benzine and other hydrocarbon solvents prompted investigations into the safety of chronic exposure to petroleum distillates.Patty, F.A.: Industrial hygiene and toxicology, Vol. II, 2nd revised ed., pp. 1198-1201. New York: Interscience Publisher 1962ACGIH: Documentation of the threshold limit values for substances in workroom air, pp.121, 124, 126, 191 and 200 (1971)Browning, E.: Toxicity and metabolism of industrial solvents, pp.145-171. London: Elsevier 1965 Many of the cases of polyneuropathy amongst workers chronically exposed to vapors of petroleum benzine and similar solvents have been attributed to the n-hexane component of these mixtures. Using an animal model (Wistar-strain male rats), Ono and coworkers reported that chronic exposure (12 h a day for 24 weeks) to hydrocarbon solvent vapors conspicuously impaired peripheral nerve function in the 500 ppm n-hexane group, slightly impaired in the 200 ppm n-hexane group and petroleum benzine II group (containing 500 ppm n-hexane), and barely impaired in the petroleum benzine I group (containing 200 ppm n-hexane). These results suggest that some components in petroleum benzine are likely to antagonize the neurotoxic effects of n-hexane to the peripheral nerves, possibly by inhibiting the oxidation of n-hexane to its more toxic metabolites 2-hexanone and 2,5-hexanedione. Ono and coworkers also observed depressed body weight gains amongst the exposed groups compared to the control group in the order: petroleum benzine II > petroleum benzine I (containing 200 ppm n-hexane) >> 500 ppm n-hexane > 200 ppm n-hexane. These results suggest that other components found in petroleum benzine may have an additive, syngeristic or potentiative effects on the biological effects of n-hexane.Takeuchi Y, Mabuchi C, Takagi S ( 1975) Polyneuropathy caused by petroleum benzine.

Greenock Morton were forced to play a home match at Clune Park on 30 December 1905 when their Cappielow Park ground was closed for a month after the referee was attacked following a home defeat to Rangers earlier in the month. The ground's record attendance was set on 10 March 1906 when 11,000 watched Port Glasgow beat Rangers 1‚Äì0 in the third round of the Scottish Cup. The highest league attendance at Clune Park came later in the year when 8,000 saw a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Rangers on 25 August. Partick Thistle used Clune Park for a home match against Port Glasgow on 20 March 1909 as their new Firhill Stadium was not ready after their move from Meadowside. In 1911 the club resigned from the SFL. Their final SFL league match at Clune Park was played on 18 February 1911, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Leith Athletic.

It is the fifth and final book of The Underland Chronicles, and was published in 2007. Scholastic has rated the book's \\"grade level equivalent\\" as 4.5 and the book's lexile score as 730L, making it reading-level-appropriate for the average fourth to sixth grader. The novel has been praised especially as a conclusion to The Underland Chronicles. In its description of the novel, as part of its \\"Recommended Books\\" award, the CCBC states, \\"Although Gregor and the Code of Claw works as a stand-alone story, readers will want to start with book one and work their way through to this final volume.\\" An audiobook version was released in 2008, read by Paul Boehmer. Plot summary Only a few hours have passed since the closing of Gregor and the Marks of Secret, when Gregor returns from the Firelands to warn Regalia of an impending gnawer attack. As the novel opens, Gregor is numb with shock from the Prophecy of Time's apparent prediction of his death. He and his bond Ares disobey Solovet and return to the Firelands to find the terribly ill Luxa, Aurora, and Howard. Gregor rushes his ill friends back to the city for treatment, whereupon Solovet orders him locked in the dungeon for insubordination. He is eventually released by Nerissa to help his sister Boots while the toddler works to fulfill the Prophecy of Time by deciphering the rats' \\"Code of Claw\\". Solovet still wants Gregor imprisoned, until Ripred and Mareth inform her that Gregor has recently developed romantic feelings for Queen Luxa, and would never leave Regalia while she is hospitalized. Shortly after this incident, an upset Gregor is called to the code room for an \\"emergency with [his] sister\\", and discovers eight-year-old Lizzie has come to bring him home. When the code team learns that Lizzie has an aptitude for puzzles, Ripred makes the suggestion that she replace Boots. Gregor is desperate to keep his family safe, so he extracts a promise from Ripred to protect them and keep them in the dark about Gregor's impending doom. While Lizzie works on (and ultimately solves) the code, Gregor fights the Bane's armies, struggling all the while to cope with his emotions about Luxa and Sandwich's prophecy. Shortly before his final confrontation with the Bane, Gregor has all but lost hope for his life. Noticing this, Ripred tells him that he doesn't believe Gregor has to die, because the old rat has never believed in Sandwich's prophetic ability. This revelation inspires Gregor to ultimately defeat the unstable Bane. Two weeks later, a wounded Gregor awakens in the hospital and learns of a series of crushing events. Though the humans routed the rats, Ares died in the Firelands of wounds inflicted by the Bane; Ripred is presumed dead; and Vikus has been partially paralyzed by a stroke brought on by his wife's death. Though Gregor no longer feels bound by it, many Underlanders wonder how the prophecy can be fulfilled while \\"the warrior\\" lives. At the rats' official meeting to discuss terms of surrender, they have their answer. Angered by both a half-dead Ripred and Luxa's readiness to return to war, Gregor breaks Bartholomew of Sandwich's sword on his knees and pronounces the warrior officially dead. Ripred and Luxa, agreeing with Gregor's sentiment, do something unprecedented and bond as a sign of their mutual desire for peace. Afterward, delegates from each species meet to negotiate more a specific treaty while Gregor's family says their good-byes and returns to New York. The novel ends as Gregor's parents discuss a move to Virginia while their children wonder how they can ever forget the Underland. Gregor takes his sisters to the park, where he remains haunted by traumatic memories of the Underland, then notes that Boots has finally learned how to say his name. Characters =Major characters= * Gregor: The series' protagonist, the Overland \\"warrior\\" of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies, and a rager (a warrior with berserker-like fighting ability). Despite his tremendous skills as a fighter, Gregor cares deeply for those around him and tries very hard to retain his humanity during the Underland war. He develops romantic feelings for the Underlander Luxa. * Ares: A large, very strong black bat and Gregor's bond. Before the war, he was shunned by bats and humans alike for allowing his bond Henry to die. During the war, however, the public's opinion of him begins to change because of his skills as a warrior. Ares is heralded as a hero upon his death in the region known as Tartarus. * Ripred: A rat, rager, and seasoned warrior. Ripred's immense experience and wisdom lead to his acting as general, strategist, and skilled fighter for the humans. Ripred never loses sight of his own goals, however, which almost restarts the human-gnawer conflict after the end of their war. Ripred becomes fond of Gregor's sister Lizzie, who reminds him of one of his deceased pups, and bonds with Queen Luxa in part because of his concern for her and her family. * Luxa: The Underlanders' young queen, granddaughter of Solovet and Vikus. Luxa is proud, stubborn, and cares deeply for her friends. Though her friend Gregor admires these traits in general, they are not an asset for her during wartime, and this causes some conflict for her in Gregor and the Code of Claw. Luxa has been bonded to the flier Aurora since childhood, and bonds to the rat Ripred at the end of the novel. She also begins to develop romantic feelings for Gregor. * Lizzie: Gregor's little sister and \\"princess\\" of the prophecy (by her relation to Boots). Lizzie is very bright, but suffers from frequent panic attacks. As such, her older brother worries for her safety and almost refuses to allow her to stay in the Underland. The rat Ripred is mainly responsible for Gregor's change of heart, and promises to protect Lizzie with his life. Lizzie believes Ripred to be lonely, and is heartbroken when she thinks Ripred has died fulfilling his promise. The successful cracking of The Code of Claw is due in large part to her efforts. * Boots (Margaret): Gregor and Lizzie's toddler sister. She is known by the crawlers as \\"the princess\\", which leads the Underland humans to believe she is important to the code-breaking effort. Her greatest importance to the story, however, comes from the contrast she presents between herself and her older brother. Gregor struggles to keep her in the dark about the terrible things going on around her, but is not entirely successful. * Solovet: The Regalian army's head and wife of statesman Vikus. Gregor distrusts Solovet because of her involvement with the plague, but is forced to obey her orders because of her capability as a military commander. Gregor freely admits that the training she forces on him may have kept him alive, but still hates her for imprisoning him in the Regalian dungeon. Solovet is ambushed while on a diplomatic mission towards the end of the war and dies. Her husband, knowing that he could have saved her at the cost of revealing that the humans solved the Code of Claw, experiences a stroke as a result, and almost dies himself. * The Bane (Pearlpelt): A highly unstable, gigantic white rat believed to be a harbinger of doom in the Underland. The Bane is emotionally fragile but extremely dangerous, especially when goaded on by his \\"friend\\" Twirltongue. He personally kills numerous Underland creatures, including the flier Ares. He is killed by Gregor and Ares in the last few chapters of the novel. Reception Gregor and the Code of Claw has been reviewed favorably by critics, yet its print version never reached the top of bestseller lists except as part of The Underland Chronicles. The audiobook version received considerably more public attention, receiving the 2009 ALSC Notable Children's Recording Award for its \\"originality, creativity, and suitability for children\\". In particular, the recording is praised for narrator Paul Boehmer's appropriately solemn tone and effective treatment of characters. A 2009 AudioFile review states, \\"Boehmer creates atmosphere by slightly modulating his voice to depict the darker tone of the story and the maturity of its theme. The satisfying conclusion is bittersweet as listeners say good-bye to the many unforgettable characters in this finely crafted series.\\" The Underland Chronicles was a New York Times, Book Sense, and USA Today bestselling series, but its fifth novel reached only 116th place on a list of best-selling hardcover novels compiled by Publishers Weekly in the year it was published. However, the book's position on that list remained mostly unchanged for the next four years. A Booklist review for the novel reads, \\"well-written, fast-moving, action-packed fantasy\\"‚Äîa sentiment generally shared by book critics. The novel has also received critical acclaim for being an excellent conclusion to its series. A School Library Journal review praises the \\"realistic conclusion, including the loss of old friends and a message about the importance of peace and trust, [leaving] readers with a sense of optimism about the future of the Underland. The story's Kirkus Reviews review makes a similar observation: \\"The resolution is bittersweet but faintly hopeful‚Äîa fitting end for an unflinchingly gutsy series whose deftly drawn characters have always lived dangerously.\\" The novel's main criticisms have centered on its mature themes, which are much more prominent in the somber Gregor and the Code of Claw than in the series's other books. Comparisons between The Underland Chronicles and Suzanne Collins's later Hunger Games trilogy cite parallels between this final novel more than any other, and note the series' many violent moments. This trend culminates with the events of Gregor and the Code of Claw, and sets the scene for Collins's later works. One Kirkus reviewer comments that though this is \\"heavy stuff\\" for preteens, the novel is an excellent \\"read-alike\\" for series such as The Heroes of Olympus, which also possess more complex themes.

He was responsible for the VMFA's acquisition of many treasured works of art, including arranging for the museum to purchase from John Lee Pratt the Francisco Goya portrait of General Nicolas Guye and from the collection of Count Karol Lanckoro≈Ñski of Vienna, Austria, a rare marble sarcophagus dating to the 2nd century B.C. The Guye portrait was long believed to be the most valuable single work of art in the VMFA's collection. The Goya portrait of General Guye is on view prominently in the posthumously created Pinkney Near Gallery at the VMFA. Biography Pinkney Near was born in New York City and was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1944 he graduated from St. Paul's School, and in 1950 he became the first art history graduate of Johns Hopkins University. He earned his Master's degree from Harvard in 1951, and he studied French Romanesque sculpture in Paris for three years on a Fulbright scholarship. He remained in Europe an additional year for research on a Sachs fellowship. He married the former Henrietta Lloyd.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney- paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n Every summer Near, a specialist in European art, and his artist wife Henrietta Lloyd Near, a former colleague at the VMFA, traveled to Europe to acquire art for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Among the cities they visited were Barcelona, London, Rome, and Venice. They were sometimes accompanied by philanthropists Sydney and Frances Lewis, donors of major collections to the museum. Near began his work at the VMFA in 1958, and, except for three years (1962-1965) when he did graduate work at Harvard and was a curator at the Cincinnati Art Museum, he served at the VMFA in Richmond the remainder of his life. In the early years, when the museum was run by a director and a curator with a small staff, Near became the first full-time curator of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, one of the first state-supported art museums in the United States. Pinkney Near died August 29, 1990 of pneumonia at a hospital in Hartford, Connecticut, where he and his wife were visiting relatives. He was 63. His memorial service was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond,Virginia, where he lived. Curator of the Cincinnati Museum of Art In 1964 Pinkney Near, curator of paintings, selected American paintings for the Cincinnati Museum's survey exhibition, ranging from early painters such as John Trumbull, Gilbert Stuart, and Washington Allston to later painters John Marin, Max Weber, George Bellows, Childe Hassam, Robert Vickrey, Marsden Hartley, Stuart Davis, Mark Tobey, Jane Freilicher, Milton Avery, and Tom Wesselmann. Curator of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Pinkney Near first came to the VMFA in 1954 for a brief visit, when he had just returned from Paris where he studied Romanesque sculpture with his Fulbright Scholarship. A year later, in 1955 he left the museum for a Sachs fellowship which sponsored further study in Europe. However, it was during this brief stay that he began the evolution of the Collections Division, and, when he returned in 1956 at the age of 29, he became curatorial assistant at the museum. Two years later he was promoted to curator but decided to pursue his graduate work at Harvard. When he returned, he became Chief Curator. Pinkney Near served as VMFA curator for 30 years, much of that time as chief administrative curator. In 1988 Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely with the Mellon Collection and with Paul Mellon, who provided important gifts of art, both paintings and sculpture portraying animals, to the museum.Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 30, 1990. Through the years Near acquired for the museum some of its greatest treasures, including paintings by Th√©odore G√©ricault, Claude Lorraine's \\"Battle on a Bridge,\\" Aristide Maillol's \\"The River,\\" Claude Monet's \\"Irises by the Pond,\\" Charles Willson Peale's \\"William Smith and His Grandson,\\" Angelica Kauffmann's \\"Cornelia Pointing to Her Children as Her Treasures,\\" and Jean-Bapiste Blin de Fontenay's monumental \\"Buffet Under a Trellis.\\" In 1976 Near announced the VMFA's purchase of American sculptor Isamu Noguchi's polished stainless steel sculpture \\"Open Lock,\\" completed in 1964. In 1982 Chief curator Near announced the acquisition of a 42\\" bronze cast of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's Genius of the Dance.Suffolk Virginia News-Herald, May 25, 1983, p.8. Among the exhibits curated by Near was one called Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert and Boucher which, although small, presented interesting issues due to the variability of the works. The exhibit made use of a recently acquired work by Jean Honore Fragonard entitled Landscape With Three Washerwomen\\". Research and publications Pinkney Near wrote The Whistlers:A Family Reunion, published in 1965 by the Cincinnati Museum of Art, followed in 1981 by Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert, and Boucher, which was published by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. While at the VMFA, the museum also published his book Apollo. In 1985, his book French Paintings was published by the University of Virginia Press. Near, along with two other art experts, Julien Binford (professor emeritus at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia) and William Campbell (Curator of American Paintings at the National Gallery of Art in Washington) selected the paintings by the deceased artist Gari Melchers for permanent display in the Gari Melchers Memorial Gallery at Belmont, the Falmouth, Virginia home of the artist.

It is owned and operated by the Lake George Steamboat Company. Original History During the 1950s and 60s, the Lake George Steamboat Company owned and operated two ships on Lake George, the Ticonderoga (II), a retired navy ship from World War II, and the Mohican (II), a converted steamer (to diesel) who was built by the Steamboat Company during 1907-1908. The Ticonderoga made trips up and down the lake, while the Mohican would make two trips into Paradise Bay.Gates, William Preston. \\"\\"Minne-Ha-Ha (II)\\"\\" Lake George Boats and Steamboats. Queensbury, NY: W.P. Gates Pub., 2003. p. 148. In 1968, with the increasing volume of tourists to Lake George Village, the primary port of the Lake George Steamboats, requests for shorter cruises became more frequent.Lake George Steamboat Company. Mountain Steamers: The History of the Lake George Steamboat Company 1817-2000. Vol. 3. N.p.: n.p., n.d. p. 22. Print. It became evident that a third boat was needed to satisfy the people who did not have time for the longer cruises provided by the \\"Mo\\" and \\"Ti\\". Wilbur Dow, the company's owner at the time, wanted to make the boat itself an attraction and it was quickly decided that it should be powered by steam. A sidewheeler was originally considered to keep with the tradition of the older steamboats on the lake, but the ship, at an estimated 100-foot design, would have appeared to be too wide and short. It was then decided to construct a sternwheel steamboat which would debut in the Summer of 1969. The steamer Minne-Ha-Ha operating on Lake George. Construction & Design The ship was designed by H.M. Tiedemann Company of New York City. The construction started on October 2, 1968, at the Steamboat Company's shipyard in Baldwin, located near Ticonderoga, New York, at the Northern end of the lake. The hull of the new ship was launched on December 6, 1968, and was towed by the Mohican to the Steel Pier, in Lake George Village. The remainder of the superstructure of the boat was erected there, and completed over the winter months at a cost of $270,000. The new boat was 103 feet long, had a 30-foot beam, and a draft of 3.5 feet. She had a displacement of 200 tons and had a top speed of 7 miles per hour. Wilbur Dow's wife, Ruth, struck the champagne bottle against the boat on July 30, 1969, and the ship was christened Minne-Ha-Ha, meaning \\"laughing waters\\". She is the second boat by the Lake George Steamboat Company to have this name, sharing it with a sidewheeler that served from 1857 to 1878.Gates, William Preston. \\"\\"Minne-Ha-Ha (II)\\"\\" Lake George Boats and Steamboats.

Since she did not fit the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, meaning she was not handicapped accessible, along with her difficult navigation because of her low speed, the decision was made to lengthen the vessel.Lake George Steamboat Company. Mountain Steamers: The History of the Lake George Steamboat Company 1817-2000. Vol. 3. N.p.: n.p., n.d. p. 37. Print. On September 14, 1998, she sailed up to the drydock at Baldwin and her hull was replaced with a new, well-designed and reshaped hull. She was then cut down her mid-section into two pieces, and 34 feet of hull was added to connect these two sections. On December 9 of that year, she was launched back into the lake and was once again towed by her sister ship, the Mohican, back to the Steel Pier, just as she had done in 1968. There, her superstructure was completed, and in late May 1999, her renovation was completed. In addition to her being lengthened and her hull being redesigned, she was also given a handicap accessible elevator to provide access to her second deck. A small propeller powered by a Caterpillar Diesel engine was added in front of her paddlewheel as a backup safety measure to assist the ship in the event that it were to lose steam power, as had happened in the past. The propellor was also added to assist the much larger \\"Minne\\" in its difficult docking process and to prevent the ship from becoming beached on large rocks next to her dock due to the lake's strong winds. The Minne-Ha-Ha, however, is still solely powered by her steam paddle wheel during her trip. Her signature twin split-stacks were removed and replaced by a 30-foot-tall sleek, single stack, and her 3 steam whistles were mounted to the new stack. The old stacks are still viewable from their mounted location on the Steel Pier. She retained her steam calliope and plays it after every cruise. A 12 x 20 ft. skylight was added to her top deck. After renovation, the \\"Minne\\" is now 137 feet long, with a beam of 30 and a draft of 3 feet and 9 inches. She has a top speed of approximately 8 mph. 21st Century The \\"Minne\\" continues to operate on Lake George. In 2001, her paddle wheel was rebuilt. After the 2007 season, her skylight was removed and replaced with an elevated seating area, which provides more seats with an escalated view. In 2008, \\"Happy Birthday\\" was played on her calliope to honor the 100th birthday of her sister ship, the Mohican. In 2013, the Steamboat Company revived an old tradition of steamers playing their calliopes as they enter Lake George Village returning to por, in addition to playing it after each cruise. As of 2020, the Steamship Minnie-Ha-Ha II has been in service for 51 years, and operates alongside her two sister ships, the M/V Mohican II, and the M/V Lac du Saint Sacrement. Cruises Since August 1, 1969, the \\"Minne\\" has made six hourly trips each day; daily during the Summer months, and on weekends during the Spring and Fall. Due to the boat's popularity, a seventh hour cruise was added over the years, as well as a moonlight entertainment cruise on Saturday nights. The boat's short, slow-paced cruises, showered the new ship with immediate popularity.Lake George Steamboat Company. Mountain Steamers: The History of the Lake George Steamboat Company 1817-2000. Vol. 3. N.p.: n.p., n.d. p. 25. Print. Steam Whistles The \\"Minne\\" currently boasts 3 antique, operating steam whistles mounted on her stack. These whistles include an 8\\" Crosby 3-Chime, an 8\\" x 50\\" single note \\"Mockingbird\\", and a 1912 3-Bell Lunkenheimer steam whistle which was originally on the \\"Iroquois\\", an Army Corps of Engineers boat on the Ohio River. The \\"Mockingbird\\" debuted for the 1970 season, replacing the boat's original 3-chime whistle. The Crosby was added during the 1970's, and the Lunkenheimer was added during the 1998 renovation. Calliope The \\"Minne\\" offers authentic steam calliope concerts daily. The calliope can be heard after each cruise, and while cruising down the lake returning to port. The original calliope was built in 1974 by the Frisbie Engine & Machine Co., 1 of 3 calliopes the company made (the other 2 are on the \\"Natchez\\" (steam powered) and \\"City of New Orleans\\" (air powered)). The Frisbie calliope was replaced by a smaller model in 1993. A brand new calliope was built & installed by Dave Morecraft in 2013.

The word is a portmanteau of data and surveillance. Dataveillance is concerned with the continuous monitoring of users' communications and actions across various platforms. For instance, dataveillance refers to the monitoring of data resulting from credit card transactions, GPS coordinates, emails, social networks, etc. Using digital media often leaves traces of data and creates a digital footprint of our activity. Unlike sousveillance, this type of surveillance is not often known and happens discreetly. Dataveillance may involve the surveillance of groups of individuals. There exist three types of dataveillance: personal dataveillance, mass dataveillance, and facilitiative mechanisms. Unlike computer and network surveillance, which collects data from computer networks and hard drives, dataveillance monitors and collects data (and metadata) through social networks and various other online platforms. Dataveillance is not to be confused with electronic surveillance. Electronic surveillance refers to the surveillance of oral and audio systems such as wire tapping. Additionally, electronic surveillance depends on having suspects already presumed before surveillance can occur. On the other hand, dataveillance can use data to identify an individual or a group. Oftentimes, these individuals and groups have sparked some form of suspicion with their activity.  Types  The types of dataveillance are separated by the way data is collected, as well as the number of individuals associated with it. Personal Dataveillance: Personal dataveillance refers to the collection and monitoring of a person's personal data. Personal dataveillance can occur when an individual's data causes a suspicion or has attracted attention in some way. Personal data can include information such as birth date, address, social security (or social insurance) number, as well as other unique identifiers. Mass Dataveillance: Refers to the collection of data on groups of people. The general distinction between mass dataveillance and personal dataveillance is the surveillance and collection of data as a group rather than an individual. Facilitative Mechanisms: Unlike mass dataveillance a group is not targeted. An individual's data is placed into a system or database along with various others where computer matching can unveil distinct patterns. An individuals data is never considered to part of a group in this instance.  Benefits and concerns  =Pros= There are many concerns and benefits associated with dataveillance. Dataveillance can be useful for collecting and verifying data in ways that are beneficial. For instance, personal dataveillance can be utilized by financial institutions to track fraudulent purchases on credit card accounts. This has the potential to prevent and regulate fraudulent financial claims and resolve the issue. Comparing to traditional methods of surveillance, dataveillance tends to be an economical approach, since it can help monitor more information in a less amount of time. In this case, the responsibility of monitoring is transferred to computers, therefore reducing time and human labors in the process of surveilling. Dataveillance has also been useful in assessing security threats associated with terrorism. Authorities have utilized dataveillance to help them understand and predict potential terrorist or criminal threats. Dataveillance is very important to the concept of predictive policing. Since predictive policing requires a great deal of data to operate effectively and dataveillance can do just that. Predictive policing allows police to intervene in potential crimes to create safer communities and better understand potential threats. Businesses also rely on dataveillance to help them understand the online activity for potential clients by tracking their online activity. By tracking their online activity through cookies, as well as various other methods, businesses are able to better understand what sort of advertisements work with their existing and potential clients. While making online transactions users often give away their information freely which is later used by the company for corporate or private interests. For businesses this information can help boost sales and attract attention towards their products to help generate revenue. =Cons= On the other hand, there are many concerns that arise with dataveillance. Dataveillance assumes that our technologies and data are a true reflection of ourselves. This presents itself as a potential concern, given that it can be believed that our data is true to our own actions and behaviours . This becomes a critical concern when associated with the surveillance of criminal suspects and terrorist groups. Authorities who monitor these suspects would then assume that the data they have collected reflects their actions. This helps to understand potential or past threats for criminals as well. There is also the lack of transparency and privacy with companies who collect and share their user's data. This is a critical issue with both the trust and belief of the data and its uses. Many social networks have argued that their users forfeit part of their privacy in order to provide their service for free. Several of these companies choose not to fully disclose what data is collected and who it is shared with. When data is volunteered to companies it is difficult to know what companies have gained data about you and your online activity. Much of an individual's data is shared with websites and social networks in order to provide a more customized marketing experience. Many of those social networks may share your information with intelligence agencies and authorities, without a user's knowledge. Since the recent scandal involving Edward Snowden and National Security Agency, it has been revealed that authorities may have access to more data from various devices and platforms. It has become very difficult to know what will happen with your data or what specifically has been collected. It is also important to recognize that while online users are worried about their information, many of those same worries are not always applied to their activities or behavior. With social networks collecting a large amount of personal data such as birth date, legal name, sex, and photos there is an issue of dataveillance compromising confidentiality. Ultimately, dataveillance can compromise online anonymity. Despite dataveillance compromising anonymity, anonymity itself presents a crucial issue. Online criminals who steal users' data and information may exploit it for their own gain. Tactics used by online users to conceal their identity, make it difficult for others to track the criminal behavior and lay claim to those responsible. Having unique identifiers such as IP addresses allows for the identification of users actions, which are often used to track illegal online activity such as piracy. While dataveillance may help businesses market their products to existing and potential clients, there are concerns over how and who has access to customer data. When visiting a business's website, cookies are often installed onto users' devices. Cookies have been a new way for businesses to obtain data on potential customers, since it allows them to track their online activities. Companies may also look to sell information they have collected on their clients to third parties. Since clients are not notified about these transactions it becomes difficult to know where your data has been sold. Furthermore, since dataveillance is discrete, clients are very unlikely to know the exact nature of the data that has been either collected or sold. Education on tracking tools (such as cookies) presents a critical issue. If businesses or online services are unwilling to define cookies, or educate their users as to why they are being used, many may unwillingly accept them. The issue stemming from companies and other agencies which collect personal data and information is that they have now engaged in the practices of data brokering. Data brokers, such as Acxiom, collect users' information, and are known for often selling that information to third parties. While companies may disclose that they are collecting data or online activity from their users, it is usually not comprehensible by everyday users. It is difficult for everyday people to spot this disclosure, since it is hidden by jargon and writing most often understood by lawyers. This is now becoming a new source of revenue for companies. In terms of predictive policing, the proper use of crime data and the combination of offline practices and technology, have also become the challenges for police institutions. Too much reliance on results brought up by big data, may lead to the subjective judgement of police, and may reduce the amount of real-time on site communication between local police officers and residents in particular areas, thus decreasing the opportunity for the police to investigate and cruise in local communities at a frequent basis. Secondly, data security still remains to be a huge dilemma, considering the access to crime data and the potential use of these data for negative purposes. Last but not least, discrimination towards certain community might be developed due to the findings of data analysis, which could lead to improper behaviours or over- reaction of surveillance. One of the major issues with dataveillance, is the removal of a human actors who are replaced by computer systems which oversee data and construct a representation from it. The removal of human actors can allow for false representations to be created, based on the data that has been collected and surveilled. This is largely due to the lack of logical reasoning present within data. Computer systems can only use the data they have, which is not necessarily an accurate depiction of individuals or their situations. Dataveillance is highly automated through computer systems which observe our interactions and activities. Highly automated systems and technology eliminates human understanding of our activities. thumb  Resistance  With such an increase in data collection and surveillance, many individuals are now attempting to reduce the concerns which have risen alongside it. Countersurveillance is perhaps the most significant concept focused on the tactics to prevent dataveillance. There are various tools associated with the concept of countersurveillance, which disrupt the effectiveness and possibilities of dataveillance. Privacy-enhancing technologies, otherwise known as PETs, have been utilized by individuals to reduce data collection and decrease the possibility for dataveillance. PETs, such as adblocker, attempt to prevent other actors from collecting users data. In the case of adblock, the web browser extension is able to prevent the display of advertisements, which disrupts data collection about users online interactions. For businesses that may limit their opportunity to provide online users with tailored advertisements. Recently, the European Union demanded companies to indicate that their website uses cookies. This law has become basic practice by many online services and companies, however, education on tracking tools with the general public differs and therefore can prevent the effectiveness of this sort of ruling. However, many companies are launching new PETs initiatives within their products. For example, Mozilla's Firefox Focus in pre-enabled with customizable privacy features, which allows for better online privacy. A few of the tools featured in Firefox Focus are also mimicked by other web browsers such as Apple's Safari. Some of the various tools featured with these web browsers are the capabilities to block ads and remove cookie data and history. Private browsing, otherwise known as Incognito for Google Chrome users, allows users to browse the web with having their history or cookies saved. These tools, aid in curbing dataveillance, by disrupting the collection and analysis of users' data. While several other web browsers may not pre- enable these PETs within their software users can download the same tools, like adblocker, through their browser's web store such as the Google Chrome Web Store. Many of these extensions help enable better privacy tools. Social networks, such as Facebook, have introduced new security measures to help users protect their online data. Users can block their posts and other information on their account other than their name and profile picture. While this doesn't necessarily prevent data tracking these tools have helped to keep users data more private and less accessible for online criminals to exploit.

She went to a private girls secondary grammar school in Vienna and graduated in 1913. She earned her doctorate in physics from the University of Vienna in 1917 on \\"Size Determination of Submicroscopic Particles Based on Optical and Mechanical Effects\\". From 1918 to 1919, she worked as an assistant at the University of G√∂ttingen and, in 1920, as an assistant in the Physical Institute of the Technical University of Berlin, where she was introduced to the experimental technique that became her major interest. Her early research concerned the Bohr model. Laski was a student of Peter Debye, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1936. Debye studied the dispersion of light by Bohr's hydrogen model and found that the theoretical curve corresponded satisfactorily to the curve observed. Laski later showed agreement between theory and experiment, however based on an erroneous interpretation of data. Laski's main research focus later on was infrared research. This included the examination of selected chemical substances by means of infrared radiation‚Äîa field of application. Beginning in 1924, Laski was the director of the Infrared Department at the Institute for Fibre Chemistry of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, a department which was closed due to lack of financing. She then became a voluntary assistant at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Imperial Physical-Technical Institute) in 1927, in order to establish an infrared laboratory. After serious illness, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics provided Laski with a monthly stipend until her death in 1928. Her final work was on special methods for infrared measurement and thermoelectricity. Her research also included studying natural infrared frequencies of diatomic Bohr gas molecules and their specific heat at high temperatures. Literature Laski wrote her thesis on \\"Size Determination of Submicroscopic Particles Based on Optical and Mechanical Effects\\", which was published in 1917 and is 48 pages long. The book is written in German and is part of the holdings of the German National Library.

The listed building is located west of the Friedlander Stra√üe in the southern part of Anklam. Since 2005 it has been the seat of the foundation, \\"Center for Peace Work - Otto Lilienthal - Hanseatic City of Anklam\\". It serves as an educational resource center and a memorial to victims of the Nazi military justice system during 1933-1945.  History  Former Military Academy, which was the location of the administration for the Wehrmacht prison Anklam The prison, which was designed for 600 prisoners, was built during 1939-1940 in the yard of the Anklam military academy. There were both group and individual cells. In the basement of the southern wing was the death row, consisting of 19 cells. The administrative offices were in the adjacent military school in which the court officers were housed. The prisoners were convicted by military courts of the military districts I (K√∂nigsberg), II (Stettin), and XX (Danzig), the Marineoberkommando (MOK) Baltic Sea Naval forces, and Luftwaffe Field Divisions I and XI. The jurisdiction also extended to Army Group North and the Heer (field army) in Scandinavia and northern and eastern Europe. Convictions resulted from both military (e.g. desertion, sedition, unlawful removal, cowardice before the enemy or insubordination) and criminal offenses. The first prisoners arrived late in 1940 and continued to arrive until 1945. Several thousand convicts passed through the prison. Some of them were used for work details in armament factories such as the Arado aircraft factory in Anklam. At times, the prison, with up to 1,500 prisoners, was overcrowded and the confinement conditions for the prisoners deteriorated. In 1944 several hundred inmates were transferred to the SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger, which was used for the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. Executions of at least 139 condemned prisoners occurred from November 5, 1941 until April 26, 1945. Approximately 100 of the executions occurred during the period from January to April 1945. About 120 clemency requests to death sentences were granted. The evacuation of the Wehrmacht prison took place on April 28, 1945. Guards and the remaining prisoners marched in three groups toward K√ºstrin, Friedland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Jarmen in the direction of B√ºtzow. The last group was captured on May 1 by the Red Army. Under the GDR government, use of the northern wing of the building was discontinued and the rest was used for the storage of grain. A working group of the Cultural Association of the GDR began research into the history of the Wehrmacht prison. The death cellblock was transformed in the mid-1970s as a memorial. Between 1990 and 2005 the building remained unused. In 2005, the newly established Foundation \\"Center for Peace Work - Otto Lilienthal - Hanseatic City of Anklam\\" took over the prison. After a partial restoration, the building is used as a center of national and international peace work.

Presented by Live Nation, the first of a planned annual series of benefit concerts was held at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee on December 20, 2014 and featured musicians Reba, Trisha Yearwood, Garth Brooks, Ronnie Dunn, Kacey Musgraves, Hayley Williams, Chad Gilbert, Charles Esten, Meghan Trainor, Martina McBride, Kix Brooks, and Deborah Allen performing renditions of various Christmas songs and tracks from Clarkson's Christmas album Wrapped in Red (2013). The concert raised over US$500,000 ticket sales and donations for four charities based in Nashville: Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Monroe Harding Children‚Äôs Home, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Thistle Farms. Clarkson had also announced plans to turn Miracle on Broadway into an annual benefit concert and planned to hold one in Bridgestone Arena on December 18, 2015. However, this concert was cancelled due to Clarkson's health complications during her second pregnancy. The 2016 concert was held on December 16, 2016.  Background  Broadway Street, a major road in Nashville, Tennessee and the site of the Bridgestone Arena (pictured). During the 2014 fall season, Clarkson conceived the idea of organizing a benefit concert during a rush-hour commute from Nashville to Hendersonville, Tennessee while preparing the release of her seventh studio album Piece by Piece (2015). She had originally planned to organize a small concert for an intimate audience. But upon presenting the idea to her manager Narvel Blackstock, the concept developed into an arena concert featuring prominent musicians who at some point had lived in Nashville. Together, they invited Reba McEntire, Clarkson's mother-in-law and Blackstock's wife. She recalled, \\"I figured if I got (McEntire), everyone would have to say yes. I've never asked an artist to do anything other than sing with me which a lot of people had said no and it hurts my feelings, which is okay.\\" Clarkson later invited a various set of musicians: Trisha Yearwood, Garth Brooks, Ronnie Dunn, Kacey Musgraves, Hayley Williams, Chad Gilbert, Charles Esten, Meghan Trainor, Martina McBride, Kix Brooks, and Deborah Allen. She revealed, \\"I basically guilted people into it. And it was a very brave thing for me.\\" Dolly Parton, whom she had also invited, had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts. Clarkson had also revealed that other recording artists had also turned down the offer for the same reason but promised to participate for a 2015 concert. On the September 5, 2015 date of her Piece by Piece Tour at the Bridgestone Arena, she announced that the 2015 edition of the benefit concert would be held on December 18, 2015. She later announced that the concert in 2015 had been cancelled because of her health problems but promised to hold another concert in 2016. The concert in 2016 was held on December 16 and the guest musicians included Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn, Kelsea Ballerini, RaeLynn, Charles Esten, The SteelDrivers and more. Clarkson, who was raised in modesty prior to winning the television competition American Idol in 2002, has cited that the main objective for Miracle on Broadway was to raise funds for Nashville charities as a means to give back to the community. She recalled, \\"We grew up in a duplex and a trailer. We grew up working really hard. We don't want to punish (our children) for being born into a family with money, but we want to make sure that they are a part of things like this from the get go. You can't grow up in your little world. There's a whole world out there, and there's people that are in need and to know how lucky they are.\\" Blackstock had originally proposed to hold the concert for the 2015 Christmas season, but Clarkson insisted to hold it in 2014, after down-scaling the promotional campaign for her Christmas album Wrapped in Red in 2013 due to her then-pregnancy. Inspired by the title of the 1947 holiday feature Miracle on 34th Street, she named the concert as Miracle on Broadway after the Broadway Street, a major avenue and Bridgestone Arena's primary address in Nashville. Proceeds from the fundraising will be sent to the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee for distribution to four Nashville charities: Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Monroe Harding Children‚Äôs Home, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Thistle Farms. Clarkson remarked that the four charities were not randomly selected, saying \\"I have visited each of these organizations, and come to know the people who run them and volunteer and the people they serve. I am so grateful and proud to call Nashville home.\\"  Concert overview  Miracle on Broadway's first concert at the Bridgestone Arena was held on December 20, 2014, just 84 days after Clarkson had made its concept. All of the acts performed only performed various Christmas songs throughout the concert, while Clarkson performed the tracks from Wrapped in Red and holiday tunes she had previously recorded, except for \\"Winter Wonderland\\", \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", \\"Hard Candy Christmas\\", \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\", and \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\". Some of the featured artists performed with Clarkson in her numbers, such as Esten (who was featured on \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\"), McBride (featured on \\"The Christmas Song\\"). In addition to performing their own versions of holiday tunes: Dunn, Reba, and Yearwood, whom Clarkson had featured in Wrapped in Red, also performed with her in their respective songs on the album. While Aben Eubanks, Ashley Arrison, and Shane McAnally, Clarkson's co-writers for \\"Wrapped in Red\\", sang with her in a Bluebird Cafe-style performance. Other featured musicians also performed solely, such as Trainor, Williams with Gilbert, Kix Brooks with Allen, Musgraves, and Garth Brooks. Clarkson remarked in an interview that \\"They all picked awesome songs to sing.\\" The whole concert lasted for over two hours. = Boxscore = Prior to closing Miracle on Broadway with \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\", Clarkson revealed that the concert was sold out and had raised over US$200,000 had through ticket sales, texting and online donations. Yearwood and Garth Brooks also announced that they are matching every dollar raised on the show, which totaled to over US$400,000. According to Billboards Boxscore chart and Live Nation, the event had raised US$524,964 in their final tally.

Inspired by Monet's studies of the same subject viewed in different light, Higdon takes another look at her own musical materials and the result is a compelling two- movement work that becomes even more interesting for listeners who are already familiar with Blue Cathedral and will be able to appreciate the many ways that Higdon recasts that material.\\" Richard Whitehouse of Gramophone compared the piece to Higdon's other chamber music, remarking, \\"Light Refracted (2002) adopts a different strategy in which the image of the title is conveyed by two distinct movements: the 'Inward' process characterised by ruminative and eloquently sustained music, the 'Outward' process represented by compact and vigorous music that does not so much balance as cancel out its predecessor.\\" See also *List of compositions by Jennifer Higdon References Category:Compositions by Jennifer Higdon Category:2002 compositions Category:Chamber music compositions ","title":"Light Refracted"},{"id":"47761305","text":"The Siege of Abu al-Duhur Airbase was a battle for the Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase in the Idlib Governorate during the Syrian Civil War. It was captured by rebel and jihadist forces on 9 September 2015. The base had been besieged since September 2012.  The siege  On 22 September 2012, rebels from the Free Syrian Army carried out a coordinated attack involving 3 rebel battalions on the airbase at Abu al-Duhur, and then preventing Syrian Army reinforcements from reaching the base. They also claimed to have shot down a fighter jet during the attack, though this was not independently confirmed. By September 2012, the Syrian Air Force base was partially besieged by rebel fighters. The rebels, led by prominent commander Jamal Maarouf, established positions on the base's western edge, from where they were able to fire on the base's runways. The base was reported to have been rendered effectively unusable as a result, with planes no longer able to fly to or from it. By this time, supplies for the troops were airdropped by helicopters that flew in from airbases in Hama. The rebels also upped their attacks on the airbase. They claimed that as a result of their employment of anti-aircraft weaponry, they rendered flights from the base inoperable.Rebels attack Syrian military airport, say shot down jet. Reuters. 2012-09-05.Chivers, C.J. Rebels Make Gains in Blunting Syrian Air Attacks. The New York Times. 2012-09-26. In August and September 2012, two MiG-21 and one MiG-23 jet fighters were reportedly downed above the airbase, including one reportedly shot down by Maarouf himself. In 2013, al-Khashir checkpoint (north east of the airport) was destroyed and burned by rebels. However, the army kept control of the village. The base itself was also unsuccessfully stormed by the FSA on 30 April 2013, which temporally seized the western part of the base. In early morning of 27 November 2014, heavily armed army units moved from Abu Duhur airbase under cover of artillery and air force and captured Haymat ad Dayir and Mustarihah villages north of the airbase, before retreating back to the airbase. After the capture of the Wadi Deif and Hamadiyah bases, the rebels turned their attention to the Abu al- Duhur airbase. They gathered about 1,000 fighters around the airport that is defended by about 700 soldiers. On 15 January 2015, the rebels launched an offensive on the village of Tal Salmo that was geared at opening a new front south of the Abu al-Duhur Military Airbase. the rebels attacked 2 points controlled by the army‚Äôs 11th Tank Division and the National Defense Forces (NDF) at Tal Salmo. the assault on the 2 axes was foiled by the loyalist forces after almost 2 days of non-stop fighting with the militant groups. The following day, the rebels pounded the village of Tal Salmo with a barrage of mortar shells in order to weaken the army fortifications. After that, the militants stormed the army defenses at Tal Salmo, attempting to breach the latter‚Äôs frontlines from the western perimeter of the village. The rebels were unsuccessful in their infiltration attempt, as the army fought off the assault, resulting in their complete control of the checkpoints adjacent to the village. 10 days later, it was reported that the rebels were in control of Tal Salmo. The village has strategic importance because it is close to the main gate of the airport and because it contains water wells that the troops in the airport consume via canalization. A week later, violent clashes took place at the main gate of the airport. On 18 January 2015, an Antonov An-26 operated by the Syrian Air Force crashed while attempting to land at the besieged Abu al-Duhur military airport. There were 35 people on board, 30 Syrian soldiers and 5 Iranian military experts. Syrian media and the pro- opposition SOHR, said that the crash was due to heavy fog or \\"technical issues\\". However, Al-Qaeda affiliated group Al-Nusra Front claimed that they shot it down. Syrian media provided a list with the names of the 30 Syrian soldiers who were killed. Per SOHR, 13 Syrian officers were among the fatalities. On 23 January 2015, the rebels managed to control al-Hamidiyeh village on the East side of the Abu al-Duhur airbase. However they pulled out to the outskirt later. On January 25, 2015, an Al Jazeera journalist from inside the village reported that the rebels were in control of al-Hamidiyeh. On 17 February 2015, al-Nusra Front reportedly shot down a helicopter above the airbase.Al-Qaida rebels down Syrian helicopter over Idlib province On 26 August 2015, rebels launched an assault on the airbase attempting to bypass the Army‚Äôs frontline defenses from two axes before they were repelled. The rebels began their assault by sending two suicide bombers with their VBIED toward the base‚Äôs western gates; however, the two militants were unsuccessful in reaching their destination, as the guards destroyed the enemy vehicles. Following their unsuccessful suicide attacks, the militants stormed the western axis of the Airport, where they attempted to bypass the fortifications at the main gate of the base. Then the rebels stormed the eastern gates of the base from their positions at the village of al-Khashir. The clashes continued until the army repelled the attackers. On 7 September 2015, rebels launched another assault on the airbase under the cover of a heavy sandstorm after at least one al-Nusra fighter blew himself up inside the base. That day, rebels captured Tabarat al-Khashit and its hill on the outskirts, forcing the government fighters to retreat towards the eastern gate. The next day, rebels advanced inside the airbase and captured the eastern part. Rebels began posting pictures of them standing in the base on the social network not long after. On 9 September, rebels captured the entire airbase. The fall of the base was initiated after the Army withdrew to the outskirts. Syrian state TV conceded that government troops had \\"evacuated their positions and moved to another point\\". According to the SOHR, at least 56 soldiers were killed and 40 captured, while dozens of others are still missing. Dozens of rebels were also killed during the battle. The airbase commander, Brig. Gen. Ihsan al-Zuhouri, was among the government casualties. As of 10 September, 18 soldiers were known to have escaped the airbase, while the rest were either killed, captured or missing according to government sources. Aftermath On 18 September, 56 soldiers were executed by the al-Nusra Front and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, bring the total number of executed soldiers in the airbase to 71. A total of 63 soldiers reached government-held areas, while over 40 soldiers were still missing. During the siege, the Turkistan Islamic Party and Nusra were accompanied by Abdallah al-Muhaysini. The Syrian government recaptured the airbase on 21 January 2018.

Biography Manuel Maria da Terra Brum was born on 2 February 1825 into some of Faial's oldest and most illustrious families, including the Brums, Terras, and Silveiras.Ribeiro (2007): p. 163M√≥nica and Silveira e Sousa (2009): p. 146 His parents were morgado Jos√© Francisco da Terra Brum, first Baron of Alagoa and last Captain-mor of Faial, and Francisca Paula Brum e Silveira. Like his father before him, Manuel was one of the largest winegrowers on neighboring Pico Island, producing 1000 barrels () of Verdelho wine annually. =Business ventures and baronage= A cultured and practical businessman, Brum dedicated his life to the \\"development of industry, agriculture, vineyards and noble exploration of all the sources of wealth in Faial and Pico\\". After his first voyage abroad he created the Quinta da Silveira (Estate of Silveira) in Santo Amaro, which became \\"one of the richest and more beautiful properties in the Azores, rivaling the decanted gardens of S√£o Miguel\\". In fact, Brum \\"was to the islands of Faial and Pico, what for the island of the Archangel [S√£o Miguel] were the Cantos and the J√°comes Correias, his friends and correspondents.\\" Powdery mildew and phylloxera spread to the Azores in 1852 and 1873, respectively, destroying vineyards and ruining the livelihoods of poor inhabitants of Pico and rich property owners of Horta alike. Battling against this, Manuel Maria introduced new castes to Pico including American grape varieties. His initiative provoked a renaissance in Pico's wines, as other winegrowers adopted new castes, resulting in new wines. During the course of this conversion, Manuel Maria spent much of his fortune‚Äîeven selling off his estate for a time‚Äîbut succeeded in recuperating his investment and buying back his propety. Recognizing Brum's contribution to the people of the Faial-Pico Channel, King Carlos I of Portugal on a 1901 visit to the Azores granted Brum the title of third Baron of Alagoa, a title that had been extinguished with the death of his brother Jos√© Francisco da Terra Brum II in 1844. =Later life= Brum was involved in various philanthropic works and construction projects. On 28 November 1859 he was one of the founders of the fraternal Sociedade Amor da P√°tria (Love of the Fatherland Society), serving as its president for several years. He was also president of the board of the Caixa Econ√≥mica Faialense (Savings Bank of Faial) and responsible for construction of the road along Vista Alegre. He had no direct descendants, leaving his house along Areia Larga, estate in Alagoa, and various vineyards, furniture, dinnerware, and boats to Ant√≥nio da Cunha de Menezes Brum and Jos√© Bettencourt V. Correia √© √Åvila, his workers Jos√© Pereira and Jos√© Francisco de Medeiros, and his servants Ricarda Lu√≠sa and Constan√ßa Margarida, with the rest of his fortune being equally divided between his nephews. His funeral took place on the afternoon of 12 July 1905. His body was escorted by directors from Amor da P√°tria, Luz e Caridade (\\"Light and Charity\\"), and the Asilo da Inf√¢ncia Desvalida (Asylum for Destitute Children), the lattermost of which he was protector and president.

Built in 1920 and brought to Maui in 1973, it served as a whaling museum until 2005, and after being sunk to create an artificial reef, now serves as a diving destination.  History  The boat was built in 1920 in Kiel, Germany at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard as Mary. Because of the terms imposed in the wake of the Armistice, Germany was required to hand over all new ships built as large steam or motor vessels, and Mary was one of a group of forty sailing ships completed at Kiel intended to operate primarily under sail, with auxiliary motor power. The boat was completed as a two-masted schooner and was just under long, with a nominal displacement of (gross). As Komet in Sweden Shortly after completion, Mary was sold to Denmark and renamed Familiens Haab in 1922, and then was sold to Sweden and renamed Komet in 1923. Komet worked the Baltic Sea as a freighter for cement. In 1970 the boat was decommissioned. Because the hull was built using steel at the Krupp yard which had been intended for U-boats, Komet (and her sisters) developed a reputation for longevity. The original Carthaginian (ex-Wandia) was a trading schooner originally from the Baltic Sea, purchased by R. Tucker Thompson in Acapulco in 1964 and later fitted as a whaling ship in San Pedro for scenes in the 1966 film Hawaii. The ship was renamed for the eponymous ship in the 1959 novel Hawaii by James A. Michener, on which the 1966 film was based. After filming, Carthaginian was purchased by the non- profit \\"Lahaina Restoration Foundation\\" (LRF). Following a brief return voyage to California, it returned to Lahaina in 1967 as a whaling ship museum and tourist attraction. However, Carthaginian was destroyed after it ran aground on the Lahaina Reef on Easter Sunday 1973 while sailing to dry dock at Oahu, and Komet was acquired to replace it. Komet was purchased in 1973 by LRF for approximately $21,000 and moved from S√∏by, Denmark to Hawaii by an all-Lahaina crew under diesel power, a voyage that lasted 105 days, arriving on September 7, 1973 after passing through Madeira and the Panama Canal. After installing of cement and steel ballast to balance the rigging, which was being assembled onshore, it was renamed Carthaginian II and restored over several years. Masts made of spruce, a deck of eucalyptus, and other details for a whaling supply ship of the 19th century were installed. In 1980, the ship was opened as a floating whaling museum. Underwater in 2017 However, the addition of ballast allowed moisture to seep into the inside of the steel hull, which rusted to a point where it nearly split in half. LRF was spending $50,000 per year to maintain the ship. In 2003, LRF approached Atlantis Submarines, proposing to sell it to be sunk as a tourist attraction. Atlantis cleaned Carthaginian II in preparation for its sinking, spending approximately $350,000 on preparations including an environmental study. On December 13, 2005, the boat was towed and sunk to create an artificial reef in water at a depth of approximately , off the coast near Puamana Beach Park. LRF was given 120 days to replace the vessel before the berth would be reclaimed for commercial operations. The berth was proposed as a potential home for the voyaging canoes Mo'okiha o Pi'ilani or Mo'olele, but Mo'okiha was berthed at Maalea Harbor instead in 2016. Today, it serves as a destination for diving expeditions and submarine tours. Scuba Diving and Sport Diver have rated the site as one of the top locations for shipwreck diving.

At the age of 18, Gossauer married Johann K√∂lla, who worked as a saddler. They lived in Z√ºrich, and in 1864 her husband learned to make photographs. In the attic of their house at Napfgasse near Neumarkt, Z√ºrich, they set up one of the first photography studios in Z√ºrich. In the same year, K√∂lla was sentenced to a fine of one month in prison because he had photographed nude dames. Shortly after, the family moved to Rapperswil where K√∂lla bought an inn at the Rapperswil railway station, and again, set up a studio. Alwina learned photography by working in the atelier, and started photographing in 1865. In 1868 K√∂lla committed an offense of making counterfeit bank bills and was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and 10 years banishment from the Canton of St. Gallen. From the bankruptcy of her husband, Alwina saved a portion of household effects and the valuable photographic equipment.Information boards on occasion of the 2015 exhibition Der Zeit voraus - Drei Frauen auf eigenen Wegen, Stadtmuseum Rapperswil-Jona. Photographer and businesswomen Kunstg√ºetli house in Rapperswil (September 2015) A folding camera type Engel- Feitknecht as used by Gossauer around 1890. Under the name Alwina K√∂lla- Gossauer she published a newspaper advertisement in June 1868 which announced the continuation of the joint business. She rented the house Kunstg√ºetli on Seequai, at the pier of the present Z√ºrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) probably to benefit from the excursion traffic and increasing tourism. There, she set up the photography studio \\"Photographie A. Gossauer\\", using her unmarried name The family lived on the first floor, and on the ground floor the customers were served. From this point, Alwina led the business successfully as a freelance photographer and businesswoman, initially under the name of her husband, K√∂lla, later under her unmarried name Gossauer. Her field of activity were classic portrait photography, landscape photography and commissioned works for books, newspapers and magazines. After serving his prison sentence, her husband tried again as a photographer, on the other side of the Seedamm between the upper and Z√ºrichsee, he established a studio on Richterswil lake shore in the Canton of Z√ºrich, to comply with the condition of the ten-year deportation from the Canton of St. Gallen. His wife loaned him photographic equipment, and also due the local separation, their relationship deteriorated rapidly. In 1871 Alwina Gossauer filed for divorce against the will of her husband; the court decided in her favour. Their five children ‚Äì aged between one and eleven ‚Äì were attributed to her, and Alwina reverted to her maiden name Gossauer and added, as it was customary, the words divorced Koella (German: geschiedene Koella). K√∂lla did not pay alimony, sold his studio in Richterswil and the photographic equipment loaned from his wife, and in vain Alwina sued her ex-husband in the civil courts. Meanwhile, K√∂lla made himself scarce, as noted in the court records, and migrated finally to America around 1868. Late years In the 1870s, the divorce was expensive and forfeited Gossauer's independence: as it was customary at that times, a legal guardian was assigned, and every contract had to be confirmed by the custodian. Nevertheless, in his annual reports the custodian also mentioned Gossauer's business acumen, her eagerness, that she was able to earn money and to find her own living without having to take any financial help. Around the 1890s and 1900s, Gossauer used a folding camera type Engel-Feitknecht for reportages and landscape photography. Alfred Engel Feitknecht was the designer of the camera made in Switzerland; between 1878 and 1894 about 6000 cameras were produced. In 1892 Gossauer was able to fulfil a long-cherished wish, thanks to her successful work as a photographer and businesswoman: at the Obere Bahnhofstrasse lane she bought land and built a three-storey commercial and residential building. On the top floor, she established a modern photography studio with a glass roof, and a large sign in capital letters wore the name of her business: \\"Photographie A. Gossauer\\". Death and aftermath Jean K√∂lla, Gossauer's son, learned his mother's photographic craft, just as her daughter Alwina (1862‚Äì1946), who remained unmarried, ran the business under the name of her mother until the 1920s. Her son Albert did not train as a photographer, but later worked together with his brother Jean. The youngest daughter Caroline married the photographer Karl Stalder; in 1920 they ran her mother's business in Rapperswil under the name K. Stalder-K√∂lla until the 1940s. \\"Alwina Gossauer was a fighter,\\" the pastor said in 1926 at her grave.

(Motown) label.The Complete Motown Singles Vol. 4: 1964 [liner notes]. New York: Hip-O Select/Motown/Universal Records Written and composed by Motown's main production team Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, it became the second and last official single by the session group from the company. The song's narrator tells off her lover, saying how it hurt her to find he's been unfaithful to her. : It was Like A Nightmare, : To know my love you didn‚Äôt share, : Like A Nightmare, : To see you in a love affair. Although this is the only single credited to the group, it was actually their second single; their previous single \\"Too Hurt to Cry, Too Much in Love to Say Goodbye\\" was credited to \\"the Darnells\\". The Andantes, as one of the label's main session groups, sang background vocals for numerous Motown acts, and used to \\"sweeten\\" the sound of others. The group was apparently promised by the company that they would be allowed to record a few singles, but this single was the only one credited to the group. Furthermore, the group was not even allowed to front either side of either single. Former Challengers III lead, and future Marvelette, Ann Bogan leads both sides of this single.The return of the marvelettes (Marvelette Gladys Horton, whom Bogan later replaced, was main lead on the previous single's A-side; Lamont Dozier, of Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, lead its B-side.) Motown did little to promote the single and it was quickly withdrawn, and thus did not chart. The group would continue to back the labels acts in the studio until the labels move to Los Angeles in 1972.

She claimed to be the granddaughter of John Radclyffe, only son of the third Earl, and in 1860 commenced to agitate for her rights, initially contacting Lord Petre as the representative of descendants of the family using the name of Lady Matilda Radclyffe. Career In September 1868, Amelia took active steps to assert her claim by forcibly taking possession of the old ruined castle at Dilston. She hoisted the Radclyffe flag on the ancient tower, and suspended portraits of the family on the ruined walls of the principal hall. Conformable to instructions from the Lords of the Admiralty, she was ejected by their agent, when she took up residence in a tent on the side of the road. After other proceedings she was imprisoned for contempt of court, her claim having formally been investigated and found to be invalid. Nevertheless, by her eccentric conduct in the prosecution of her claim, she continued to keep constantly before the public until her death. She was an accomplished woman, a lover of fine art, and an artist in oil, and she was powerfully and sincerely impressed with the righteousness of her claim. Her death was caused by bronchitis, after five days' illness. She had expressed a wish to be buried in the Radclyffe vault at Hexham, but her desire could not be complied with, and she was consequently buried at Blackhill Cemetery, Consett near Durham. Her assertions, published in her jottings, were that John Radclyffe, the son of the last Earl of Derwentwater, and de jure 4th Earl of Derwentwater did not die in 1732, but was trafficked to Germany, and in 1740 married at Frankfort-on-Main, Elizabeth Arabella Maria, Countess of Waldstein. He died there in 1798, in his eighty-sixth year. His son James, at that time in his fifty-fifth year, was his heir, and was married to Eleanora the Countess Mouravieff, but leaving no issue, was succeeded by his brother, John James, who was born at Alston, in Cumberland, in 1764. The latter died in 1833, having married, late in life, Amelia Anna Charlotte, Princess Sobieski, a descendant of the noted Polish family of that name. They had several children, of whom John James, born in 1816, and Amelia Matilda Radclyffe, the soi-disant Countess of Derwentwater, were the only survivors. In 1869 she sought to collect her rents, accompanied by Harry Brown, a bailiff of the Shotley Bridge Court; when the tenants refused to pay, she wielded an antiquated sword, and a short struggle ensued, resulting in the snapping of the sword.27 February 1880, the 'Newcastle Courant' The Countess of Derwentwater is a character: when she took a steamer at Jersey City for Liverpool, her wardrobe was said to consist of over two hundred rich and elaborately trimmed dresses. She travelled with 15 trunks which were as old as the dresses.The Mercury, Hobart Tasmania Friday 6 October 1871 Amelia‚Äôs true identity remains a mystery. Ralph Arnold in his 1959 book Northern Lights suggests that she may have been a lady‚Äôs maid from Dover by the name of Burke though he offers no further explanation of this. The Northumbrian Jacobites website suggest that she may have been a West Country servant girl trying her luck. The 'Countess' died at Durham Road in Durham on 27 February 1880. A plaque was attached to the previously unmarked grave of Amelia in 2012 in Blackhill Cemetery, near Consett, County Durham. Members of the Northumbrian Jacobite Society added a plaque to a small stone cross, which had been previously erected by society members George and Lorraine Hunter.The Northern Echo, Friday 31 August 2012 References Category:19th-century British people Category:British women Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1880 deaths Category:Impostors ","title":"Countess of Derwentwater"},{"id":"47761940","title":"Nathan Lovejoy"},{"id":"47761953","text":"The following is a list of state highways in the U.S. state of Louisiana designated in the 3100‚Äì3149 range. __NOTOC__ Louisiana Highway 3100 Louisiana Highway 3100 (LA 3100) runs in a general east‚Äìwest direction from US 165 Bus. to the junction of US 167 and LA 28 in Pineville.

The liturgical feast of the title is every 8 September, which is the Feast of the Nativity of Mary. The paired devotion along with a crucifix called Santo Cristo del Perd√≥n is highlighted in a prayer apostolate known as Crusaders for Penance and Charity, a prayer group started by women which focused on Catholic social justice for the poor and the destitute, and was originally founded to combat Communism.  History  In the 1950s after the Second World War, the province of Pampanga was plagued with Communism which threatened both the Catholic religion and social order in the Philippines. The lower and the middle class laity conflicted with wealthy landowners, which caused much political unrest in the region. C√©sar Mar√≠a Guerrero, the first Bishop of San Fernando, decided to revive the Marian devotion (introduced to Manila and Pampanga in 1574 by the Spanish) in an attempt to ease tensions. Guerrero was a native of Malate, Manila where the local church enshrined a similar image of Our Lady of Remedies. Bishop Guerrero requested the image of the Virgen de los Remedios, already venerated as Our Lady of Remedies from Baliti, Pampanga to be borrowed by San Fernando to help with a new apostolate working towards peace and reconciliation, called Cruzada de Penitencia y Caridad (Crusade of Penance and Charity). Great piety and monetary donations were garnered primarily due to the wealthy noblewomen and widows who contributed into the religious group, along with the consistent religious processions and recitations of Rosary which made the devotion popular among the masses. A system of bylaws for the apostolate was created, making the group more organized and official which helped it to grow and increased ecclesiastical recognition.http://viewsfromthepampang.blogspot.com/2010/06/200-virgins-tale- our-lady-of-pampanga.html By 1954, the people of Baliti, Pampanga became adamant in requesting that their image be returned to their town. As a result, Bishop Guerrero commissioned the santero artist Victoriano Siongco to carve out a larger image of the Immaculate Conception for the official use of the Crusade, and the Baliti image was returned to its original parish. Pontifical approbation The Papal decree issued by Pope Pius XII for the canonical coronation of the image in 1956. On 11 February 1956, Bishop Guerrero submitted a petition to Cardinal Federico Tedeschini, who at the time was the Apostolic Dataria to Pope Pius XII requesting to grant a canonical coronation. On 15 July 1956, Pope Pius XII issued the pontifical decree on the Canonical Coronation of the image which occurred on 8 September 1956, the same day of its current feast.http://archive.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/local- news/2014/09/07/58th-anniversary-pampanga-patroness-commemorated-364206  Feast and veneration  The Feast of Virgen de los Remedios of Pampanga is celebrated each 8 September, the Nativity of Mary. In the United States, the Archbishop of Los Angeles, California crowns a replica of the image each year at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.http://asianjournal.com/calendar- of-events/58th-canonical-coronation-anniversary-of-the-virgen-de-los-remedios In 2010, Capampangans in the Bay Area also started with an annual re-enactment of the Canonical Coronation. The initial coronation was held at the Our Lady of Peace Shrine in Santa Clara, California. Since then, the event rotates through the Diocese of San Jose, Diocese of Oakland and the Archdiocese of San Francisco and is held every 2nd Sunday of November.

Care for clocks constitutes regulating the external environment, cleaning, winding, lubrication, pest- management, and repairing or replacing mechanical and aesthetic components to preserve or achieve the desired state as specified by the owner. Clocks are typically composed of multiple types of materials such as wood, metal, paint, plastic, etc., which have unique behaviors and environmental interactions, making treatment options complex. The materials used and the complexity of clockwork warrant having a Horological Conservator complete the work. Conservation of the Old Town Hall clock in Prague,CZ  Conservation and restoration  Interventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation. World's oldest Sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC). University of Basel - Valley of the Kings, Egypt = Horological Conservation History = The history of clock conservation dates back to ancient times. Horology, the study of the measurement of time, dates to 1450 BC, \\"when the Ancient Egyptians first observed the earth's natural circadian rhythms (Meadows, C., (n.d.).Meadows, C., (n.d.). Horology: A Brief History. Retrieved from: https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief- history‚Äù Some examples of instruments used to measure time include: clocks, watches, sundials, hourglasses, time recorders, and atomic clocks. Horological Conservation is the science and art of preserving timepieces to connect humanity with the history and heritage of timepieces. = Conservators = A conservator who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to ‚Äú[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].‚Äù Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as ‚ÄúSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].‚Äù Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided. Conservators are encouraged to use restraint when restoring objects due to ethical concerns and only make necessary repairs rather than altering the appearance of objects such as clocks for aesthetic preferences. One exception to this dilemma is conservation done to correct previous treatments, which scholarship and investigation have proven to be dishonest or poorly-conceived efforts that took an object further away from its original form.  Preventive conservation  Preventive conservation involves the proper handling, creating and maintaining suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance to prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock's sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock. = Correct Handling = Handling is a potentially a major source of damage to any heritage item. Any handling of an object should be planned in advance and requires some precautions. Certain measures taken by a clock handler can prevent opportunities for damage. Pendulum removed from clockwork. Work areas should be clean and arranged to support the safety of the clock: uncluttered, free of any potential for the clock to be bumped, jostled, or moved unnecessarily, and secure from theft. Wearing ‚Äú[...] cotton or Nitrile gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock‚Äù can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. Loose items such as jewelry and loose clothing like scarves or bulky jackets worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with, and cause damage to, a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. Pendulum damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement. This can also prevent damage to other interior components. When moving or handling a \\"weight-driven clocks, it is advisable to wait until the clock has wound down before it is relocated. Once it has stopped running, carefully remove the weights and pendulum\\". A clock \\"[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area\\" and moved from one location to the next on its back. The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location. = Proper Storage and display = 19th c. Tiffany Longcase Clock photo donated by the Met 192934 Proper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock's safety. For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \\"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.‚Äù Clock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements. Motion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An HVAC system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.  Correct Humidity and temperature levels  The humidity and temperature of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed. :a. Wood clocks :The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% relative humidity is suitable. During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime. :b. Metal clocks :Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%. The mechanics inside a timepiece  Running Clocks vs. Static Display  Clocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas ‚Äúrunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts. Replacing the inner workings of a clock still requires handling, which could potentially damage the clock. It is important to note that conserving a non-functional clock is much less invasive (cheaper!) and preventive protection against corrosion and environmental hazards is the main concern for its stabilization and care.[viii] Perhaps the least invasive solution to highlight a functional clock would be to purchase a replica clock and safely store the original‚Äù. Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. = Regular Clock Maintenance = Regular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts.Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/ Even under perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate. Clocks should be examined and re- lubricated every three years. After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and ‚Äòcleaned‚Äô if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided Visual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. Regular maintenance also applies to the environment surrounding the clock to ensure that the correct storage conditions are present. :a. Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication :Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock‚Äôs history, as ‚Äú[...] various ‚Äúdirt‚Äù or ‚Äúsalt‚Äù deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].‚Äù Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined ‚Äú[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.‚Äù :Cleaning clocks consist of multiple steps, which may or may not all be done as part of a treatment plan: washing, ultrasonics, rinsing, drying, polishing, refinishing, chalk brushing, and pegging out. At this point, should cleaning be the only treatment employed, the pieces could be reassembled with proper lubrication; however, depending on the type of clock, the pieces could also be primed for further treatments to the various parts such as mechanisms, frames, wheelwork, pivots, mainsprings, screws and screw threads, escapements, balance springs, pendulums, etc. Ruhla alarm clock. Image copyright owned by Maksym Kozlenko. :b. Winding and setting :In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding.\\"Traditionally, the job of winding the clocks was given to an horologist or a trained individual. Winding had to be done at certain times of the day; ideally when the temperature was just right and the room vacant. Each clock had its own unique keys, doors, and intricacies within the mechanisms.\\" Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time. :When hand setting a clock, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning. Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, ‚ÄúRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.‚Äù  Agents of Deterioration  Damage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration (AOD) are the ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during handling or transportation of the object. = Physical Force = Physical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. Physical force damage commonly occurs when handling the object. Any excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Clocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Any excessive physical force can damage the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small clocks to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security of the clocks greatly reduce this risk. Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are: :a. Mishandling :The failure of a handler to remove loose items like jewelry or clothing items like scarves from their person can result in these items striking a clock‚Äôs surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving ‚Äúunsightly and potentially damaging marks.‚Äù A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a large clock ‚Äú[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.‚Äù Lifting a clock via false handles or non- sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface. :b. Over-winding or improper hand setting :Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as ‚Äú[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily‚Äù, as well as by turning the key too many times. :c. Unstable storage or display :Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock‚Äôs condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non-secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human-caused accidents occur. = Theft and Vandalism = Some clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. While a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft. With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. If a clock is on display in a location that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution. High security, cameras, and inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique clocks, are usually required in professional institutions. = Disassociation = The disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. ‚ÄúClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components‚Äù, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run. = Incorrect Relative Humidity = The variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. ‚ÄúA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out‚Äù. Changes in relative humidity can cause wooded clocks to expand or contract. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can ‚Äúloosen the joints of organic components‚Äù. When changes in humidity causes the wooden parts of the clock to expand and contact, the inorganic components of a clock remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object. This is particularly a problem if the wood becomes warped and creates a pressure point against the inorganic interior workings. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks. High humidity can cause warping, rotting, and mold or fungus growth in a wood clock, and can corrode the metal components of a clock. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. = Incorrect Temperature = The temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. ‚Äú[...] extremes in temperature and humidity‚Äù can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \\"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\\" In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks. Clocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials. With wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood‚Äôs surface. Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates of storage areas can cause rapid deterioration to wood clocks. Incorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. = Pests = Depending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Many pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood. Wood-boring insects may infest a clock if it is stored in an environment which supports insect activity and allows them access to the clock. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because ‚Äútheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock‚Äôs movement‚Äù. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed: :* Carpet beetle\\\\- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such ‚Äú[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.‚Äù :* Powderpost beetle- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood. = Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet = Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways; many of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood‚Äôs surface and develop irregular markings. Ultraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood. Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry- rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure. Exposure to both UV and infrared light can alter, damage or ruin any stains or finish on a wood clock. Light agents of deterioration can be associated with temperature agents of deterioration, depending on the nature of the light source. Heat from a light source can also cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached. Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration ‚Äú[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or ‚Äúalligatored‚Äù appearance.‚Äù = Pollutants = Dust buildup on top of a clock case. Pollutants are any elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object. Chemicals, smoke, airborne particles, and gases are all pollutants that can damage a clock. The following are two such examples: :* Dust is one such contaminant which settles on a clock‚Äôs surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. Dust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms ‚Äúthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of ‚Äúsandpaper [...].‚Äù Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. :* Oil is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can ‚Äúcause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution‚Äù. The mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed and insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damage. = Fire = Like most heritage objects, clocks are highly vulnerable to fire. Not only are the fluctuations in temperature harmful, most clocks will be irreparably damaged if exposed to fire. Errant embers from a fireplace can be a potential threat to mantle clocks. Other threats may be any open flame, wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light. Many clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. = Water = Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. The components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry. It may be extremely difficult, depending upon the severity of the water damage, to repair or restore the clock to its correct condition. Salvaging warped or rotted wood can be challenging and the damaged material may need to be replaced entirely. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Specific Types of Clock Damage  Damage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed. = Wood damage = Due to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage. Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include ‚Äú[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\\" = Metal damage = Similar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This ‚Äú[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.‚Äù = Plastic damage = Modern clocks may feature plastic cases, dials, faces, and mechanisms in conjunction with more traditional materials, such as metal or wood. As plastic was created in the twentieth century, conservation treatments are still being researched by conservators. Since the term plastic covers a broad spectrum of materials from celluloid to technopolymers, there are various reactions to environmental factors and agents of deterioration, making clocks with plastic cases or component parts susceptible to unique stresses that are not wholly understood at this point. What is known is that different types of plastics can degrade quickly and unexpectedly because of the inherent vice of some polymers. The \\"serpentine\\" and \\"stone\\" of the pillars on this Seth Thomas black mantel clock are made of celluloid glued to wood. Image copyright owned by Mark James Miller Exposure to improper lighting, humidity, water, or solvents may cause chemical deterioration in plastics resulting in reactions such as ‚Äúa white powder ‚Äòblooming‚Äô on the surface of an object, discoloration, distortion of the object‚Äôs shape and strong indicator smells of vinegar, or mothballs,‚Äù crazing, cracks, acid deposits, and sticky surface textures. It can be difficult to easily identify the chemical makeup of the plastic used to create an object, which can make interventive conservation challenging because the potential reactions to treatments are unknown. Therefore, preventive conservation tactics similar to those used for organic objects are the primary method of caring for objects made with plastic such as clocks. = Finish or paint damage = Finish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products ‚Äúcan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.‚Äù Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands. = Interior or clockwork damage = Clockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill- advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement. = Improper cleaning and polishing = Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that ‚Äú[...] have been proven to age poorly.‚Äù Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called Stress Corrosion Cracking. Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can ‚Äú[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.‚Äù = Improper lubrication = Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it. The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in ‚Äú[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].‚Äù A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \\"Poor-quality oil\\" on clockwork, which \\"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\\" The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to ‚Äúthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place‚Äù during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it ‚Äú[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.‚Äù Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.  Examples of Clock Conservation and Restoration  = Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock = Horological conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house Anglesey Abbey by the National Trust. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \\"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\\" The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \\"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\\"  References  Category:Clocks Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Hr:Konzervacija satova ","title":"Conservation and restoration of clocks"},{"id":"47762075","text":"300x300px Brian Pounds is a singer-songwriter based in Austin, Texas.

It was released on 18 September 2015 on Peaceville Records. Background The album features the return of guitarist Calvin Robertshaw, replacing Hamish Glencross. Hamish departed amicably to focus on his other band, Vallenfyre. Andrew Craighan, the principal songwriter for the album, observed that he felt \\"a brand new freedom\\" during the creative process. He explained further his sense of creative freedom: \\"To give some insight into the mentality behind this album, once I started writing, I just thought, I'm going to write music I like. If it fails, I'll take the slings and arrows.\\" Craighan has stated the album is, contrary to the title, not the most miserable album in the band's discography, suggesting that it was distinguished by \\"stronger more direct songs, more hints of death doom through fog-cloaked slithering ambience. It's a more colourful record even if they are mostly hints of colour that's actually bleakness.\\" Craighan noted that \\"the album title is probably being misunderstood\\" and clarified that Reception Feel the Misery received generally positive reviews. Greg Pratt of Exclaim!, Sam Shepherd of musicOMH and Chad Bowar of Loudwire all described the album as a following the band's formula.

On 8 September 2015, the Boeing 777 operating the flight suffered an uncontained engine failure and fire in the left (#1) GE90 engine during take-off from Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport, prompting an aborted take-off and the evacuation of all passengers and crew. All 170 people on board survived, but 20 were injured. The aircraft, which suffered moderate damage to a section of its forward fuselage as of a result of the vigorous fire, was repaired and returned to commercial passenger service in March 2016.  Incident  The aircraft left Terminal 3, Gate E3, at 15:53 local time, and began its take-off from Runway 07L at 16:12 where the incident occurred. (Login required) After noticing what the pilot later described as a \\"catastrophic failure of the engine\\" well before take-off speed, the flight crew aborted the take-off by using the aircraft's brakes and ordered an evacuation of the aircraft. All 170 passengers and crew escaped. Nineteen people sustained minor injuries and one person sustained serious injuries. The aircraft is thought to have reached a speed of approximately when the decision to abort was made; far below the takeoff decision speed of the aircraft, which would have been at least . The airport's emergency services extinguished the fire within five minutes of the mayday call. Fourteen people were lightly injured, mostly from sliding down the escape chutes, and treated at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center. The fire caused a large hole in the cargo hold and damage to the engine. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated the fire was caused by failure of the left General Electric GE90 engine, one of two fitted on the aircraft. The aircraft came to a halt upwind, causing the fire to be blown towards the fuselage; the aircraft sustained localised, but major, structural damage as a result. The aircraft was equipped with suppression systems, though the systems did not extinguish the fire. The runway, one of four, was closed for four hours, and several inbound flights were cancelled.  Aircraft and crew  Victorville in February 2016, showing the unpainted fuselage skin and engine cowling The aircraft involved in the incident was a Boeing 777-236ER, s/n 29320, registered as G-VIIO. At the time of the incident, the aircraft was 16 years old; it had been delivered new to British Airways on 26 January 1999. The captain was 63-year-old Chris Henkey, who had been with British Airways since 1973 and received his type rating on the Boeing 777 in 1999. He had 30,000 flight hours, including 12,000 hours on the Boeing 777. Flight 2276 was intended to his penultimate flight before his retirement (which was intended to occur in a week), but following the accident he decided that Flight 2276 would be his final flight. The unnamed 30-year-old first officer joined the airline since 2006, receiving his type rating on the Boeing 777 in 2011, and had 6,400 flight hours, with 3,100 hours on the Boeing 777. An unnamed 45-year-old relief pilot was also on board. He had been with British Airways since 1997 and had been type rated on the Boeing 777 since 2001. The relief pilot had 14,000 flight hours, and like captain Henkey, was also well experienced on the Boeing 777 having logged 10,000 hours on it. He was a first officer at the time of the accident.  Repair  In December 2015, British Airways announced that a team of engineers from Boeing had assessed the aircraft and determined the damage was limited and suitable for repair. As a result, it was announced that the aircraft would be repaired and returned to service. A team from Boeing completed the repairs in February 2016. Airworthiness tests were conducted on the aircraft on 25 February 2016. On 26 February, the aircraft made its departure from Las Vegas McCarran airport at 1:33 p.m. and was flown to Victorville, arriving at 3:06 p.m, where it was repainted and further repairs and maintenance work was performed. The aircraft was then flown to British Airways Maintenance Cardiff in Cardiff on 15 March for a routine C check. Finally, it returned to its London Gatwick base and resumed passenger service on 24 March.  Investigation  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the American air accident investigative body, dispatched four investigators to the site the day after the incident. As well as FAA, Boeing and General Electric involvement, the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch has a representative and that representative has appointed \\"British Airways and the UK Civil Aviation Authority as technical advisors\\". Initial NTSB findings were that an uncontained engine failure had occurred and that the \\"left engine and pylon, left fuselage structure and inboard left wing airplane were substantially damaged by the fire\\". On 6 October 2015, the NTSB issued an update stating that the accident was traced to the failure of the \\"stage 8‚Äì10 spool in the high-pressure compressor section...liberating fragments that breached the engine case and cowling\\". The NTSB released their final report 2 years and 10 months later. The cause of the accident was determined as \\"The failure of the left engine high-pressure compressor (HPC) stage 8-10 spool, which caused the main fuel supply line to become detached from the engine main fuel pump and release fuel, resulting in a fire on the left side of the airplane. The HPC stage 8-10 spool failed due to a sustained-peak low-cycle fatigue crack that initiated in the web of the stage 8 disk; the cause of the crack initiation could not be identified by physical inspection and stress and lifing analysis. Contributing to this accident was the lack of inspection procedures for the stage 8 disk web.\\"  See also  * American Airlines Flight 383 (2016) - Caught fire at O'Hare Airport. * Korean Air Flight 2708 ‚Äì Another Boeing 777 that experienced an engine fire at Haneda Airport. * BOAC Flight 712 * British Airtours Flight 28M *TWA Flight 843 *Saudia Flight 163  References   External links  ;National Transportation Safety Board *Cockpit Voice Recorder transcript *Flight Data Recorder readout Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2015 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Nevada Category:2015 in Nevada Category:McCarran International Airport Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 777 2276 Category:September 2015 events in the United States Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving uncontained engine failure ","title":"British Airways Flight 2276"},{"id":"47762159","text":"Clymene coleana, formerly known as Porphyra cinnamomea, is a red alga species in the genus Clymene.

The work takes the form of letters between a fictional bachelor traveling in the United States to his European friends. Cooper wrote the work while in Europe, and originally published the work anonymously, to conceal his identity and be more convincing to European audiences. The book persuasively argues for the virtue of American values and democracy in comparison to the aristocratic values of Europe. The bachelor writing the letters uses various elements of American culture as examples to examine the larger cultural trends; for example, he uses the American navy's systems of promotion and preference, as an example of the larger American government's creation of a meritocratic allocation of authority. At times, too, the book doesn't fully confront all of the social issues confronting early America, instead representing them as idealized: for example, James D. Wallace describes the book as treating the domestic sphere as a \\" \\"sheltered space,\\" a protective enclosure not only for domestic values and religious ideas, but for gentlemanly honor, literary creation, and the very republican principles on which America was founded\\" (a concept known as Republican motherhood in scholarship).

Disappearance On March 15, 1957, Larry Bader, a cookware salesman for the Reynolds Metals Corporation from Akron, Ohio, rented a boat, kissed his wife Mary Lou goodbye, and went to Lake Erie to go fishing. His boat was found the next day after a storm. The boat had minor damage and a missing oar. Bader, who was $20,000 in debt and in trouble with the IRS, was missing. The couple had three children, with another on the way. \\"Fritz\\" Johnson Four days later, John \\"Fritz\\" Johnson made his first known appearance at Roundtable Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. Johnson immediately attracted attention by sitting on a flagpole for thirty days to raise money for polio. Johnson's popularity led to his becoming a bartender, radio announcer, and TV sports director at KETV-7. With his flamboyant personality, he became a minor celebrity in the Omaha area. Johnson lived an equally colorful bachelor lifestyle, driving a hearse equipped with pillows, a bar, and an incense burner, aptly naming it his \\"hunting vehicle\\". In 1961 Johnson married Nancy Zimmer, a 20-year-old divorcee, and adopted her daughter. Later they had a son together. In 1964, it was discovered that Johnson had a cancerous tumor behind his left eye. He lost the eye and wore an eyepatch, adding to his flamboyance. Reappearance On February 2, 1965, Johnson, who like Bader was an archery enthusiast, attended a tournament in Chicago. An acquaintance from Akron saw Johnson and, despite the eyepatch and mustache, recognized Bader. He then brought Bader's 21-year-old niece, Suzanne Peika, to have a look. Convinced, she asked him, \\"Pardon me, but aren't you my uncle Larry Bader, who disappeared seven years ago?\\" Johnson laughed it off, but Mrs. Peika called in his two brothers from Akron, who had his fingerprints compared with Bader's military records. They matched. Johnson was now faced with the fact that all his memories were false and that he had two wives. Man with two wives Bader's reappearance caused many problems for Mary Lou, his first wife. She had been receiving monthly Social Security payments of $254, and had received $39,500 from Bader's life insurance that would have to be paid back. Also, Mary Lou had been dating since her husband's \\"death\\", and had recently accepted a marriage proposal. With the marriage reinstated, her new marriage was impossible, since she was Catholic. Since Bader's reappearance, his marriage to Nancy was regarded as legally null and void. However, she claimed she would stick by him. Analysis A team of psychiatrists examined Bader for ten days. Their conclusion was that Johnson had no recollection of his former life. There was evidence in Johnson's past that he might have wanted to \\"start again\\", having tried various unsuccessful get-rich-quick schemes and getting into trouble with the IRS for tax evasion. According to psychologists, cases of amnesia lasting several years, in which the person filled the missing time with false memories, are rare but not unheard of. Another theory was that the tumor may have been responsible for Bader's apparent memory loss. This was never determined.Local history: TV personality a dead ringer for missing Akron man. Ohio.com Death The malignant tumor that cost Bader his eye eventually resurfaced. Bader/Johnson died on September 16, 1966, at St. Joseph's Medical Hospital in Omaha.

University career Daly played CIS football for the McMaster Marauders from 2009 to 2013. He played in 38 games over those five years and recorded 83 solo tackles, 24 assisted tackles, 10 interceptions, and one quarterback sack. He was part of the Marauders' 2011 and 2012 Yates Cup conference champion teams.

He also played in both post-season games, including playing in his first Grey Cup game where he recorded three special teams tackles, which ended in a loss to the Stampeders in the 102nd Grey Cup. In 2015, Daly established himself more on defense in his sophomore season, earning his first professional start on July 2, 2015 in a 52-26 win over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. In that game, he recorded his first defensive tackle, and had a total of four, while also notching his first interception in the same game.

Immediately after publication the publisher, believing the political satire to be possibly libellous, recalled the edition after some 250 copies had been distributed. The satire was excised and replaced by the poem \\"Christmas Creek\\". The book was re-published in January 1881. Reception Reporting on a debate in the NSW Parliament in April 1887, The Sydney Mail reported: \\"The discussion, as a whole, upon the motion was not interesting, but it brought out a telling hit from Mr. Cameron at Mr. Melville by the former introducing into what he had to say the last verse of an unpublished poem by the late Henry Kendall. 'It might,' said Mr. Cameron, 'be very appropriately called, \\"The Song of Ninian Melville.\\" I believe it appeared in a volume published by the late Henry Kendall, but as there was some threat of a libel action, it had to be withdrawn. However, Kendall cannot be charged with libel now, and I will read the last verse to the hon. gentleman. It describes him exactly.' And then with dramatic action and suitable emphasis, he read: ‚Äî House with high august traditions, Chamber where the voice of Lowe, And the lordly words of Wentworth sounded thirty years ago; Halls familiar to our fathers, where in days exalted rung All the tones and all the feelings which ennobled Bland and Lang. We in ashes, we in sackcloth, sorrow for the insult cast By a crowd of bitter boobies, on the grandeur of the past. Take again your penny whistle, boy, it is no good to me, Last invention is a bladder with the title of M.P. To say that the House laughed does not nearly describe the manner in which hon. members enjoyed the fun. Mr. Melville, white-faced, and very ill at ease, challenged Mr. Cameron to read the whole poem outside, and by some means becoming impressed with the idea that Mr. Hugh Taylor was at the bottom of the business, he challenged the member for Parramatta to say where he had had the poem printed, and said he would make him answer for it in the Supreme Court. Mr. Taylor looked a little uncomfortable, but only smiled.\\"\\"Legislative Assembly\\", The Sydney Mail, 2 April 1887, p688  Further publications  * Songs from the Mountains by Henry Kendall (1880) * Selected Poems of Henry Kendall edited by T.

The best-known craft of Puebla is Talavera pottery‚Äîwhich is the only mayolica style pottery continuously produced in Mexico since it was introduced in the early colonial period. Other notable handcraft traditions include trees of life from Iz√∫car de Matamoros and amate (bark) paper made by the very small town of San Pablito in the north of the state. The state also makes glass, Christmas tree ornaments, indigenous textiles, monumental clocks, baskets, and apple cider. History Handcraft traditions of the state are a mixture of indigenous and European. These traditions can be viewed as two main types: those that retain most of their indigenous quality, and those heavily European in design or technique. Indigenous-style products include certain pottery traditions, textiles, and the making of amate (bark) paper. European styles include Talavera pottery and glass. Pottery 19th century Talavera piece on display at the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City Glazed, double-fired pottery called mayolica was introduce to Mexico from Spain between 1550 and 1585, and was produced in various areas during the colonial period. However, only in Puebla has it been made continuously to the present. The best known pottery of this type is called Talavera, named after the white background ceramics of Talavera de la Reina, Spain, which it sought to imitate. Like its namesake, Puebla Talavera is characterized by a white background, achieved with tin salts, and mostly blue decorative features using cobalt salts. It has been used to make vases, china, sculpted figures, and tiles. White with blue only as decoration is the most traditional but there are other colors that are accepted as well. The blue decoration of Puebla Talavera is both from east and west. Glazed ceramic was invented in Asia and came to Mexico via Europe, specifically Spain. However, there is also direct Asian influence on the work because of the Oriental goods that came to the country on the Manila Galleon. The use of talavera and other tiles also distinguishes Puebla architecture, being found on facades of major buildings all over the state. A number of other communities have lesser-known pottery traditions. The best known of these is that of Iz√∫car de Matamoros, whose main product are a traditional sculpted work called a tree of life. These are distinctly decorated from the better- known trees of Metepec, State of Mexico. The best known artisan of this tradition is Alfonso Castillo Orta, who won the National Prize of Arts and Sciences in folk art in 1996. The family continues to make the trees and other figures such as those of La Catrina, those for nativity scenes, Frida Kahlo, and more. The Castillo family‚Äôs work has garnered awards both in Mexico and abroad, and are found in noted collections such as that of the royal family of Spain. Common pottery item include large pots and casseroles used for cooking traditional dishes such as rice and mole poblano. These pieces are glazed on the interior, with the outside decorated with black and or pastillaje (small bits of clay rolled into designs). Most of the pottery is made in the city of Puebla, especially in the Barrio de la Luz neighborhood. This kind of pottery- making remains a viable occupation because of the creativity and organization of the artisans who work principally to make large size cooking utensils. Production can be highly specialized among artisans, with those dedicated to different aspects of the process such as molding and firing. The making of these utensils survives because traditional rural cooking techniques still survive in many parts of the state, where meals are prepared in clay pots over wood fires, especially for major festivities and celebrations. These are also made in the town of Amozoc de Mota, to the east of the city of Puebla, where being a member of an artisan family still carries some prestige. The town makes two kinds of pottery, kitchen utensils, and pots‚Äîand two kinds of decorative animal and human figures: those used in sets such as for nativity scenes, and miniature skulls. Much of the kitchenware is large pots and casseroles for preparing mole poblano‚Äîand sometimes also used for adobo, pipian, or tinga. Other are for making rice or bean dishes. Pots include those for making atole and other hot beverages, and for making traditional pi√±atas. The work is divided by sex and age in artisan families, usually directed by a male. Families make the greenware and sell the pieces to those who fire them, who in turn sell them to middlemen. Most are sold locally and in the central eastern region of Mexico where Puebla is located. Both the Barrio de la Luz and Amozoc communities also make ritual items such as incense burners, candle holders, and containers‚Äîwhich are generally covered in a black glaze and most often used for Day of the Dead decoration. Acatl√°n traditionally makes unglazed clay toys. However, the work of pottery Her√≥n Mart√≠nez in the 20th century has promoted the creation of larger sculpted pieces. Textiles Puebla has had a history of industrial textile making, but the hand-made ones remain important, especially culturally. Rebozos and quechquemitls are important items in traditional indigenous dress. One particular tradition is the making of black wool rebozos, richly decorated with multicolored animal and flower designs that predate the Conquest. These originally had religious significance but have mostly been lost. Acaxochitlan is a traditional Nahua community noted for its textiles. They sell various types of garments, mostly on the nearby highway. Some products are made on backstrap looms, and most are embroidered. These garments are distinctive to the community, often with multicolored birds and mythological figures. Makers also decorate garments with small beads. Santa Anita is known for weaving wrap skirts. Amate Amate paper wall hanging from San Pablito Amate paper is made in the small village of San Pablito, Pahuatlan in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. The paper dates from the pre Hispanic era, when the Aztecs used it for codices and ritual use. The making of the paper survived in this remote area for ritual purposes, making cut-out figures. The most important traditional use for this paper was the making of cut-out figures for religious and magical ceremonies. Today, most is made for sale to other indigenous artisans who use it to paint images in Amayaltepec, San Agustin de las Flores, and various communities in the state of Guerrero. The town has less than five thousand inhabitants but is the main amate paper producer in the country. It is made in family workshops, where the bark fiber is pounded daily. The chemicals used in making the paper is causing environmental problems, such as pollution in the nearby Cazones River. It has caused a depletion of the trees needed to provide the bark. Glass Glass work in Mexico began in Puebla with the first glass kiln documented at 1542, before spreading to other areas such as Mexico City and Guadalajara. Initially, the production was utilitarian containers. Production in Puebla mostly consisted of pressed glass, of which little remains. A wide array of drinking glasses and commercial containers were made, especially those for pulque. However, this has all but disappeared because of competition from industrial glass as well as the decrease in the consumption of pulque. Most handcrafted glass production today is blown glass, with some pressed glass is used to make miniatures. One notable glass product are glass spheres to decorate Christmas trees. The best known community for this is Chignahuapan, a small town in the Sierra Norte region, surrounded by pine trees. The craft became established here when Rafael Mendez from Tlalpujahua, Michoacan, set up shop in 1970. Today, this workshop employs about 100 people. The spheres are blown glass coated on the inside with silver nitrate, then handpainted on the outside. Sizes ranges from tiny spheres sold as earrings, to very large singular pieces displayed on its own wood base selling for about 2,000 pesos each. Expert painters can do thousands spheres a day, depending on the design used. While painted spheres dominate, other Christmas tree ornaments such as glass in other shapes (e.g., pi√±atas, fruit, and human figures), and those with pine branches, ixtle and wood are also made. The town has about 450 family workshops and six small factories, which make the community the number one producer of Christmas ornaments in the country. The town holds an annual fair dedicated to the craft at the end of October to the beginning of November. The fair attracts visitors from Mexico and abroad, mostly from the United States and Spain, and business people interested in export. Some artisans make different designs for display year-round, for other seasons, for social events, and as personalized trinkets. One of the newer designs are clear spheres filled with feathers, or notes with words such as ‚Äúlove‚Äù and ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù Other traditions Inside the Centenario clock works in Zacal√°n Other handcrafts are related to construction, such as stone quarrying and artistic wrought iron‚Äîboth important to colonial and colonial-style buildings. Onyx is a commonly worked stone, not only for construction, but also for the making of decorative objects such as boxes, lamps, book holders, and tables. Other objects made with this material include drinking glasses and jewelry. Zacatl√°n is home to a monumental clock works, where each piece is made to order in a small factory. Centenario clocks began when Alberto Olvera Hern√°ndez began building them in his father‚Äôs woodshop, located outside the town, even making his own tools. After making several as a hobby, he opened a workshop in town, which became the first of its kind in Latin America. Today Centenario is known for making monumental clocks for towers, churches, public buildings‚Äîand ‚Äúflower‚Äù clocks, where vegetation provides the face. These clocks can be found in most parts of Mexico and some abroad as well. The business remains family owned, with about fifty employees. Amozoc is noted for silver-inlaid iron work, which is almost entirely dedicated to the production of gear for charros such as spurs, stirrups, buttons for charro suits, and pistol butts. While charro as a working profession has waned, charro associations and competitions continue as a cultural activity. Santa Mar√≠a Chigmecatitl√°n is a Mixtec community in southern Puebla that is noted for its basketry, especially the making of miniature figures with palm fronds. While the town has woven palm for many years, only after 1965 did miniatures become popular, mostly due to demand from tourists and handcraft retailers. Acaxochitlan is also known for basketry, making floor coverings, petates, and other types of mats. Apple cider in Mexico is mostly drunk for the Christmas and New Year‚Äôs holidays. It is generally sweet, mildy alcoholic, and carbonated. The most famous variety is made in and around the town Huejotzingo, which hosts an annual cider and handcrafts Fair. It is made with locally grown apples and comes in two varieties: rose (mixed with red wine) and natural. It is sold in various parts of the country. Cider and fruit wines are commonly made in small enterprises in the north of the state, in communities such as Acaxochitlan, which makes one wine from a local fruit called acachul. The Copa de Oro cider enterprise in Huejotzingo hosts a museum dedicated to cider making in Puebla, especially to the history of the enterprise, with photographs, documents, and keepsakes.

Early life and career He was born in Sydney to accountant Thomas Douglas Percy Holden and Mary Walsh. He ran a tobacconist and barber shop in Regent Street, Redfern. On 16 August 1898 he married Louisa Hodge, with whom he had three children. In 1899 he was commissioned as a Justice of the Peace. Political career A foundation member of the Redfern Labour League, the local branch of the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales, Holden served as treasurer of the electoral committee for the local member for Redfern, James McGowen. In February 1908, Holden stood for the Redfern Ward of Redfern Municipal Council and was one of seven Labor-endorsed candidates elected to the 12 member council, with Alderman John Leitch, with Holden's nomination, becoming the first metropolitan Labor Mayor in New South Wales. In February 1911, Holden was unanimously elected Mayor of the council with an annual allowance of ¬£150. In March 1912, the now-Premier James McGowen advised Governor Lord Chelmsford to appoint 12 Labor candidates to a life appointment to the New South Wales Legislative Council and Holden was chosen alongside Edward Kavanagh, Francis Bryant, Henry Doyle, James Browne, Ernest Farrar, James Joynton Smith, James McInerney and Andrew Sinclair. Soon after his election however, Holden came under intense scrutiny from Sydney scandal sheet The Truth, who alleged that Holden, a personal friend of Premier McGowen, only employed non-union members in his hairdressing shop. Truth also alleged that McGowen was a patron of Holden's shop and paid a penny less than the minimum required by hairdressers' union members. T. W. Kelsey, general secretary of the Hairdressers and Wig-makers Employees' Union of NSW, confirmed the allegations: \\"It is a fact that Mr. Holden [...] employs non union hairdressers in his shop at Redfern. He engaged a non-unionist hair dresser only a fortnight ago. He has two employees in his hairdressing saloon, and both, so far as I am aware, are non unionists. I, as secretary of this union, have openly denounced the Labor Government for appointing to the Legislative Council as a Labor member a man who thus defies union principles. He has been applied to several times by myself and others to employ only unionists, and he has always refused to give us any assurance that he would do so.\\" Holden found himself under investigation from the Political Labor League which recommended to the 1914 state conference that Labor endorsement of his candidacy for Redfern council in the 1914 municipal elections be refused. Holden, retiring as mayor of Redfern, but continuing as an Alderman was nevertheless reelected in his council seat ahead of the Labor-endorsed candidate. By 1916, however, a Labor executive minute noted that Holden's employees in his shop were now union members and he was now able to continue as a Labor-endorsed member. Despite being a personal friend of McGowen, Holden did not follow him or John Leitch when they were expelled from the Labor party over the conscription question. Later life Holden opposed Jack Lang in the 1931 split and sat as Federal Labor until the reconstitution of the chamber in 1934, when he retired. Holden died on New Year's Eve at Ashfield in 1938 whilst still serving as a Redfern Alderman. His son Thomas Sinclair Holden was also a member of the council, elected at the first indirect elections for the council.

The organization is best known for bringing a civil action against the United Nations for a breach of duty of care for the failure to prevent the genocide at Srebrenica. Supreme Court of The Netherlands, The Netherlands Case Number 10/04437 (2012).S. Leyersdorff & L. Melvern, \\"The Dutch Supreme Court Grants Immunity to the UN Regarding Srebrenica: A Legal Summary with Comments\\", Genocide Prevention Now, 2012, No. 10; accessed July 31, 2018. The Mothers of Srebrenica was founded in 2002 by Hatid≈æa Mehmedoviƒá to advocate for justice for victims of the Srebrenica massacre and collect donations for their surviving family members. Mehmedoviƒá, a homemaker turned human rights activist who lost her husband and both sons in the massacre, had returned to Srebrenica, also in 2002, becoming one of the first Bosniaks to move back to the region after the war. She served as President of the Mothers of Srebrenica until her death in 2018. Court case The Mothers of Srebrenica bought proceedings in a Dutch local court regarding the Srebrenica massacre citing that a Dutch battalion under United Nations oversight was responsible for the safe haven at Srebrenica in 2007, that both the United nations and Netherlands breached that duty of care, and they were negligent. The Netherlands court held that under Article 105 of the United Nations Charter the United Nations has immunity in this instance. The district court held that they did not have jurisdiction to even hear the case. The matter was appealed to a higher court in 2012 where it was argued by the Mothers of Srebrenica that the United Nations immunity denied the party the right to a trial, which is guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights. The appellant court held the United Nations Charter had primacy over domestic laws, based on Article 103 of the UN charter, and it remained absolute even in the face of claims of violation of jus cogens. The Court held that even jus cogens does not overrule the absolute immunity of the United Nations. The court found that \\"pursuant to the judgment of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. United States in which the ICJ interpreted Article 103 of the UN Charter to mean that the Charter obligations of UN Member States prevail over conflicting obligations from another international treaty, whether earlier or later in time than the Charter, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands came to the conclusion that the UN enjoys absolute immunity.\\" Therefore any right of access to courts contained in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 14 in International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights did not prevail over the immunity of the United Nations even given the gravity of the alleged charges.Mothers of Srebrenica et al v. State of The Netherlands and the United Nations legal summary, internationalcrimesdatabase.org; accessed July 31, 2018. In 2014 the mothers filed a separate claim against the Dutch government, using a series of different terms, and the Dutch court found for the Mothers of Srebrenica but found the Netherlands liable for only 300 of the 10000 deaths. The legal basis that differentiated the two was that in the second trial the court looked at the issue of effective control, and found that because the command shifted at the point where the safe haven was overrun and at that point effective control shifted from the United Nations to the Dutch government due to the loss of command structures. The Dutch government was found to be responsible for safety of the safe haven for that short time. This second case upheld the United Nations' immunity.Wendy Zeldin, Netherlands: Supreme Court Holds U.N. Cannot Be Sued in Bosnia Massacre Case (Library of Congress, 2012); accessed July 31, 2018. The precedent of this case is that participating state under a United Nations flag may be liable where the UN immunity is enforced. In 2019 the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ruled that the Dutch forces were 10% liable for the massacre given the 10% probability that they could have prevented it. The Dutch compound held 350 Muslims who were unknown to Serbian forces but were still evicted from the compound on Serbian demands; the court ruled the Dutch forces directly responsible for their deaths. Mothers of Srebrenica were in attendance however they were not provided with translators, and had to be informed about the ruling afterwards.Mothers of Srebrenice et al. v.

Goodyear House is located at 888 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, New York, part of the Delaware Avenue Historic District, a federally designated historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974. The Ch√¢teauesque house was designed by prominent Buffalo architect Edward Green, of the Buffalo architecture firm Green & Wicks, and was completed in 1903 at a cost of $500,000 (). The home was built for Charles and Ella Goodyear. Goodyear was a founder and head of several companies including the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, Great Southern Lumber Company, and the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad Company, as well as a director of Marine National Bank, and General Railway Signal. House =Exterior= 300x300px The exterior of the two and a half story house is brick trimmed with stone. The mansard roof includes a row of dormers with pedimented tops with a festooned motif that runs along the roofline above a dentilled cornice. The principal entrance is on the north (right) side of the house denoted by a large arched doorway, bordered on each side by stone urns. The east fa√ßade facing Delaware Avenue has a one-story porch with columns, that was later bricked in. =Interior= \\"Life\\" by Karl Bitter The walls of the main hall are covered with red Italian brocade (woven fabric) and with pilasters and cove (concave-profile) moldings of carved American walnut. Over the mantle of the marble fireplace in the main hall is a six-foot marble relief, weighing two tons, called \\"Life\\" by Karl Bitter. The relief won the gold medal at the Saint Louis Exposition, 1904 and is placed on a foundation extending to the cellar. The dining room of the house features wood paneling with multiple stained glass windows, triglyphs with guttae below in the frieze, and carved bound laurel leaves in the corner cabinet featuring brass festoons and bellflowers. At the time the Goodyear's lived in the house, the dining room was furnished with a table, sideboard, and 12 chairs of solid Honduras mahogany, purported to have cost $7,000 () in 1903. The dining room is connected to the breakfast room, the palm room, and the loggia which has a view of the gardens and the lawns beyond. The library and hallways of the house are also covered in the intricately carved American walnut. Though the home is only two and a half stories, it has five levels: basement, ground floor, first bedroom floor, second bedroom floor, and attic. A spiral staircase with a wrought-iron balustrade and an oak hand rail snakes through three of the floors, from the ground to the second bedroom floors. The House was built with eleven bedrooms, each with a marble fireplace and adjoining marble bath, and an elevator. The rooms of Charles' daughter, the late Mrs. Arnold B. Watson, featured a large sitting room covered with a light blue brocade and woodwork painted with at least 10 coats of ivory enamel. Significance 25th anniversary of the Great Southern Lumber Company (and Anson Goodyear's fiftieth birthday) celebrated at the House In October 1919, when King Albert I of Belgium, Queen Elisabeth of Bavaria, and their son Prince Leopold took an official visit to the United States, they visited Buffalo. During their visit, they were entertained as guests of Charles' wife Ella Portia Conger Goodyear in the House. The Charles W. Goodyear House is in the Delaware Avenue Historic District, a federally designated historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974. The two block-long historic district is only a fraction of the former \\"Millionaires' Row\\" of Delaware Avenue. In Anson Goodyear's (Charles W. Goodyear's son) unpublished manuscript, he wrote, \\"Delaware Avenue that mattered began at Niagara Square with the house of Millard Fillmore and ended at Gates Circle‚Ä¶\\" The Charles W. Goodyear House was in the center of this path. He went on to say \\"The Delaware Avenue of my early days was the champion residential street of the United States. Further west in Cleveland, Euclid Avenue had some pretensions, but we did not admit a great rivalry. The great elms along the way towered over green stretches of lawn, some imposing mansions...and a coterie of curious characters.\\" Additional Buildings In addition to the main house, there is the Carriage house and a power building for coal furnaces. It was purported that during the winter, the Goodyear House required up to one and a half tons of coal per day to generate sufficient heat. The power plant is connected to the house by a four foot wide tunnel. Subsequent Owners 300x300pxIn 1940, shortly after Mrs. Goodyear's death, the mansion was sold to the \\"Hospital Service Corporation and the Western New York Medical plan,\\" also known as the Blue Cross Corporation. At the time, it was reported that \\"with the exception of the kitchen and pantries and a few of the bedroom partitions, the house will not be changed by the hospital corporation.\\" In 1950, the house was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo for $85,000 (), at which point it became the \\"Bishop McMahon High School.\\" The first floor rooms including the den, living room, solarium, billiard room, dining room, in addition to the 11 bedrooms were converted to classrooms. The bedrooms adjoining bathrooms were converted into locker rooms for the students and the kitchen was converted to the senior class room. In 1988, the house was again sold, this time to the Women & Children's Hospital of Buffalo, managed by Kaleida Health, to be used as the \\"Robert B. Adam Education Center\\" as a home to several programs for children including a day care early childhood program. In 2005, the house was sold for $875,000 (), and today, is operating as a school again. The current school, the \\"Oracle Charter School,\\" was formed under the vision of \\"creating a small, caring, college prep high school\\" as an alternative to the large public high schools. The House underwent extensive renovation work, starting with a first phase in 2005, funded by a $300,000 stimulus grant through the \\"Charter Schools Institute,\\" that included 13 classrooms, a cafeteria, renovations to the library and the gym/auditorium space. Additional phases focused on renovation of another five classrooms, plus science labs as well as reintroducing green space back to the site. Oracle Charter School closed in 2018 and the building was sold once again. It is currently being renovated into a boutique hotel.

Through New Mexico the highway passes through Shiprock, Bloomfield, Tierra Amarilla and Tres Piedras, sharing a short concurrency with I-25 near Raton, before heading east through Clayton to the Oklahoma state line. Route description U.S. Route 64 (US 64) starts at an intersection with US 160 at Teec Nos Pos on the Navajo Nation. The highway then heads southeast passing an intersection with Bureau of Indian Affairs Route 5028 (BIA 5028) at the edge of town across the highway from the Teec Nos Pos Trading Post. The highway then cuts through a mesa before making a slight curve south by southeast. Past the mesa, US 64 passes through sparse ranch land, intersecting BIA 5111 before turning slightly eastward. After passing an intersection with BIA 5113, US 64 crosses the New Mexico state line. US 64 approaching the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge Entering from Arizona, US 64 continues into the town of Beclabito, traveling to Shiprock. There US 64 makes a concurrency with US 491 for . US 64 continues east into the city of Farmington, where it is multiplexed with unsigned State Road 5001 between junctions with US 64 Business. Then it passes through Bloomfield, followed by the towns of Blanco and Navajo City. After entering the Rocky Mountains, US 64 has a concurrency with US 84 from Chromo Mountain to Tierra Amarilla. The highway then passes through Tres Piedras before crossing via the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge and heading into Taos. US 64 continues through the towns of Eagle Nest and Cimarron before eventually reaching I-25. The two highways bring up a short concurrency before US 64 turns northwest off of I-25 in Raton, then continuing to travel east, this time bringing up a concurrency with US 87 through the towns of Capulin, Des Moines, Grenville, and Mount Dora. The two highways split in Clayton, and US 64 forms another new concurrency with US 56 and US 412\\\\. The three highways barely touch the Texas Panhandle before continuing into Oklahoma. History When originally designated on November 11, 1926, U.S. Route 64 (US 64) had its western terminus at US 385 in Capulin, New Mexico. In 1933, US 64 had been extended to end at US 85 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, replacing all of the previously designated US 485 between Raton and Santa Fe, through Taos. On November 11, 1972, US 64 was truncated from Santa Fe to Taos, then extended west through Tres Piedras, Brazos, Monero and Bloomfield to US 550 in Farmington. The new routing replaced all of New Mexico State Road 111 (NM 111) and NM 553 between Taos and Tierra Amarilla. US 64 now shared a concurrency with US 84 between Tierra Amarilla and a highway junction east of Monero. US 64 then replaced all of NM 17 between US 84 and US 550 in Farmington. On December 2, 1988, or sometime after that date, US 64 was further extended over Arizona State Route 504 and New Mexico State Road 504 to a junction with US 160 in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona near Four Corners. Today, the western terminus of US 64 remains at Teec Nos Pos. New Mexico State Road 5001 State Road 5001 (NM 5001) is an unsigned state highway in the U.S. state of New Mexico.

In parliament, he served as Attorney-General (1903 to 1904) and Leader of the Opposition (1906 to 1909). Early life Nicholls was born in Ballarat, Victoria in 1868, to the English journalist Henry Richard (H. R.) Nicholls and his Irish-born wife Ellen Minchin. He was educated in Ballarat, until his family moved to Hobart, Tasmania in 1883 so his father could take up the editorship of The Mercury newspaper.David L. Mulcahy, Nicholls, Sir Herbert (1868‚Äì1940), Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1988, accessed online 9 September 2015. Legal career After working as a mail clerk, Nicholls was articled to Andrew Inglis Clark and Matthew Wilkes Simmons, and was admitted to the Bar in 1892. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Tasmania in 1896, and became a barrister. Political career At a 1900 by-election, Nicholls was elected as an independent member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, representing the multi-member electoral district of Hobart until 1903 when he became the sole member for Central Hobart. From 1903 to 1904, Nicholls held two ministries in the cabinet of William Propsting: Attorney-General and Minister administering the Education Act. As Attorney-General, Nicholls represented police superintendent Frederick Pedder, the respondent in the landmark High Court case D'Emden v Pedder. On 29 May 1906, following the state election the eight opposition members of the House of Assembly voted for Nicholls as their leader. In December 1908, the cabinet of John Evans unanimously decided to appoint Alfred Dobson, Tasmania's Agent- General in London, as third judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. Dobson declined the appointment for personal reasons, and Nicholls was offered the role and accepted. He resigned from the Tasmanian Parliament on 1 January 1909. Judicial career When the Chief Justice of Tasmania, Sir John Dodds, died in office in June 1914, Nicholls was appointed as his replacement. As chief justice, Nicholls served as Administrator of Tasmania on occasions when the Governor of Tasmania was absent from the state, or in between the appointment of governors to the role. Nicholls was serving as administrator in October 1923, when the Nationalist government of Sir Walter Lee lost a confidence motion on the floor of the house. Nicholls refused to dissolve the parliament and call an election, and appointed Joseph Lyons as Premier of a minority Labor government when Lee resigned. Nicholls was lieutenant-governor and administrator of the state for nearly three years from December 1930 to August 1933 between the end of Sir James O'Grady's term and the appointment of Sir Ernest Clark. Honours Nicholls was made Knight Bachelor in 1916 for his work as chief justice. In 1927, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

He is known for his work in expanding epidemiology to focus on chronic diseases as well as infectious ones. Early life and education Lilienfeld was born in New York City on November 13, 1920. His father, Joe Lilienfeld, came from a wealthy family in Galicia, Ukraine, and worked as a Galician rabbinical scholar. Joe and his wife had immigrated to the United States in 1914 to escape the draft, leaving their money (which was all in German marks) behind in Germany when they did so. He graduated from Erasmus High School, whereupon he enrolled at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, allowing him to move in with his brother, Sam (a Baltimore resident), in 1938. In 1941, he received his A.B. from Johns Hopkins, after which he applied to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, but was told he would be rejected because he was Jewish. He then enrolled at Albany Medical College for a time before transferring to the University of Maryland's medical school. He received his M.D. from the University of Maryland in 1944, and his M.P.H. from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1949. Career Lilienfeld joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health as a lecturer in 1950, and became an assistant professor of epidemiology there in 1952. From 1954 to 1958, he served on the faculty of the University of Buffalo School of Medicine. During this time, he also founded, and served as the first chairman of the department of statistics and epidemiological research at Roswell Park Memorial Institute. In 1958, he returned to Johns Hopkins, where he became the head of the DIvision of Chronic Diseases in the Department of Public Health Administration, which became the Department of Chronic Diseases in 1961. In 1964, he was named the staff director of the President's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke. In 1967, he co-founded the Society for Epidemiologic Research, a learned society for epidemiologists. In 1970, his Department of Chronic Diseases merged with the Department of Epidemiology, and he became chair of the new department. Department of Epidemiology there. In 1974, he sustained a cardiac arrest in the middle of a class he was teaching. He was revived by his students. Following on that illness, in 1975, he resigned the chair of this department. He subsequently became the first director the Masters in Public Health Program at Johns Hopkins, and instituted its reformation and revitalization. He then became the acting chair of the Department of Mental Hygiene for a 18 or so months during which a new chair was recruited. The last administrative role he had in his career was as acting chair of the Department of Behavioral Science. He has been described as \\"instrumental\\" in the founding of the American College of Epidemiology in 1979. Work Lilienfeld is known for working to expand the field of epidemiology from its original focus on infectious diseases to include chronic diseases, which has led to him being called the \\"father of contemporary chronic disease epidemiology.\\" He is also known for, along with Richard Bordow, co-authoring the chapter \\"Biomedical Evidence for Determining Causality\\" in the Surgeon General's 1982 report Health Consequences of Smoking: Cancer, as well as for advocating for the link between smoking and lung cancer in a 1962 article he wrote for The Nation.

It involves the recognition that, even with data from psychometrically strong measures, the assessment process is inherently a decision-making task in which the clinician must iteratively formulate and test hypotheses by integrating data that are often incomplete and consistent. EBA has been found to help clinicians in cognitively debiasing their clinical decisions. Evidence-based assessment is part of a larger movement towards evidence-based practices. EBA was first introduced in the field of medicine, and has been introduced to other fields, notably clinical psychology. The EBA approach is widely acknowledged to be an empirically driven method to clinical decision-making, and Cochrane reviews have reported the efficacy of EBA methods.  History and development   Limitations  = Test selection and inadequate assessment = While numerous guidelines have been developed to assist psychologists in conducting EBAs, psychologists often fail to follow guidelines, with projective tests often used to assess child adjustment. Professionals conducting assessment have been shown to have considerable variability in the extent to which they followed professional guidelines, with evaluators failing to assess general parenting abilities. = Problems in test interpretation = Professionals and authorities commonly mistakenly recommend the interpretation of variability between and within scales that may not be vigorously tested. For instance, due to rigorous efforts in developing norms, and developing reliability and validity measures, certain measures, such as the Wechsler intelligence scales for both adults and children, are seen as the strongest psychological instruments around. It is common practice for authorities to recommend the consideration of subtest scores. However, subtest scores, unlike full-scale IQ scores, often have lower levels of internal consistency reliability, which results in reduced precision of measurement and increased likelihood of false positive and false negative conclusions about the assessment.

The gun was approved for series production in 2019. It had struggled to clear user trials, failing on three occasions in a row in 2017. Development The Dhanush project was started by OFB to replace the older 105 mm Indian Field Gun, 105 mm Light Field Gun and the Russian 122 mm guns with a modern 155mm artillery gun. The initial indigenous development of artillery guns in India started in the 1970s with the Artillery Gun Development Team under Brigadier Gurdyal Singh at Gun Carriage Factory, Jabalpur. This resulted in the introduction of 105mm artillery guns into the Indian Army. Later the corruption scandal surrounding the purchase of Bofors resulted in no indigenous artillery guns being procured for the Indian Army. The purchase of Haubits FH77 guns manufactured by Bofors in the 1980s included technology transfer to OFB. After many years being unable to acquire or import foreign artillery guns due to the corruption charges, OFB developed the Dhanush gun. In trials it came out better by 20 to 25 percent than the Haubits FH77 in parameters like range, accuracy, consistency, low and high angle of fire and shoot-and-scoot ability. Three Dhanush guns were handed over to the Indian Army for user trials on July 2016. Battery trials were expected to be completed by July 2017 with 18 guns entering service in 2017, 36 guns in 2018 and 60 guns in 2019, for an Indian Army order of 114 guns. It was reported in July 2017 that the howitzer failed the last phase of testing, due to the shell hitting the muzzle brake. A redesign of the barrel by widening it was being considered to solve the issue.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desi-howitzer-fails-last-phase- of- tests/articleshow/59691394.cmshttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/desi- howitzer-fails-last-phase-of-tests/articleshow/59694586.cms Later an investigation revealed the incident happened due to a defective shell. Further trials were conducted by firing about 5000 shells in the desert regions and icy glaciers of the Himalayas without any incident. The gun is planned to enter service in four to five months. In June 2018, Dhanush completed final development trials. In February 2019, it was approved for series production. The gun was officially inducted in army on 8 April 2019.https://www.rediff.com/news/report/army-inducts-home-made-dhanush- howitzer/20190408.htm Variant A vehicle mounted variant of the gun called Mounted Gun System was showcased by OFB at the Defexpo 2018 show.

It traces the evolution of horror films as they began to focus on more reality-based, less campy subjects during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Background  The book grew out of an article Zinoman wrote for Vanity Fair in 2007. Over four years, Zinoman collected interviews with filmmakers, and, after interviewing family and friends, returned to the filmmakers again, to find new, fresh topics for interviews. Zinoman also researched stories he heard repeated from multiple sources, such as the former friendship between John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon, both of whom were responsible for important horror films in the 1970s. To differentiate the clashing styles of horror filmmaking that took place in the 1960s, Zinoman used the terms \\"Old Horror\\" and \\"New Horror\\". These are borrowed from a 1979 Harper's Magazine article written by Ron Rosenbaum. Zinoman defines Old Horror as being campy films focused on stars, while New Horror is more politically aware, realistic, and focused on directors. New Horror also has what Zinoman describes as a \\"postmodern sensibility of evil\\", where antagonists have no discernible motive. Zinoman says that films like Targets offer commentary on this change- over.  Reception  Cynthia C. Scott of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote that the book \\"lacks the epic scope\\" of other New Hollywood histories, but it offers compelling arguments to take the discussed films seriously. Ty Burr of The New York Times praised the book's research but wrote it \\"struggles to bring the larger picture into focus\\". Matthew Hays of The Globe and Mail called it \\"crucial reading for any serious horror aficionado\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club rated it A‚àí and wrote that the book's only flaw is that it should have been longer. Ryan Daley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 5/5 stars and described it as \\"the most effortlessly enchanting treatise on the American horror film since Stephen King's Danse Macabre\\".

Each incident resulted in projectile damage to cars, and one girl was injured. A suspect was arrested on September 18, but charges against him were dropped in April 2016. Events Beginning on August 27, eleven shootings occurred: eight by bullets and three by unspecified projectiles. Ten of the incidents occurred on Interstate 10, while the eleventh was on State Route 202. The final shooting occurred on September 10. False leads On September 11, a man and woman driving a car were taken into custody in relation to the shootings. The woman was later released, but the 19-year-old male suspect was kept in police custody, as sources stated that he boasted about the shootings to friends. He was later arrested on an unrelated marijuana charge. Road debris shattering windows also played a role in the investigation, as shattered windows were often investigated as being part of the spree. For example, on September 16 a driver reported his windows being shot by a car that he was seeking to pass, but police later stated that road debris caused the window damage. Three 18-year-olds with a slingshot were arrested on September 13 on claims that they had been making copycat attacks, and the three admitted to targeting cars and pedestrians. They were later released. Suspect Leslie Allen Merritt, Jr., age 21, was arrested in Glendale on September 18. Police initially claimed that Merritt held anti-government and anti-police views. One day after his arrest, police announced that they had linked the first four shootings to a pistol owned by Merritt. He was charged with fifteen felony counts, including carrying out a drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, unlawfully discharging a firearm, disorderly conduct, and endangerment; prosecutors also considered filing terrorism charges, but ultimately did not, as terrorism-related laws focused primarily on protecting public utilities and did not encompass freeway shootings. All charges were dropped in April 2016, and Merritt later filed a lawsuit against state officials.

Founded as Bitcoin Group, after attempting to become the first digital currency company to IPO without a so-called 'backdoor listing', the company expanded its focus into consulting and corporate fraud and extortion prevention.  History  Bitcoin Group was founded in 2014 as a bitcoin mining company as a result of a partnership between Sam Lee, Allan Guo and Ryan Xu. , with seven bitcoin mining locations in Australia, China, and Thailand, Bitcoin Group's mining operation generated 6.2 petahashes, approximately 15.7% of the Global Hash Power. The company made a submission to the Australian Senate‚Äôs Economics References Committee for their 2015 inquiry into digital currencies. The submission advised the committee that while the company did not agree with the ruling on the GST treatment of digital currencies by the Australian Taxation Office, its ambitions would have been more difficult to realize without the regulatory clarity that it provided. Bitcoin Group announced that it would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in October 2014. The attempt was delayed by two stop orders from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Following ASIC's request for an Independent Expert Report, the company undertook a third attempt to list on the ASX through an IPO, planning to issue 100 million new shares by January 2016 and thereby raise $20 million at 20¬¢ a share and achieve a market capitalisation of $32.9 million based on 164,870,930 shares on completion of the offer. Bitcoin Group closed their offer on 25 January 2016 after raising $5.9 million, less than a third of the target, and in March 2016 withdrew the offer and refunded subscribers after ASX deemed their liquidity insufficient. The company said the capital report by an independent accounting firm which the exchange had required did not take into account the expected rise in bitcoin prices following block halving in July 2016. In August 2016 Bitcoin Group rebranded as Blockchain Global to reflect a broadened focus including management consulting and business incubation. The company later developed the blockchain exchange platform ACX.io; in February 2017 it reached an agreement with Digital X to take over the function of that company's blockchain exchange platform, Digital X Direct. In January 2020, it was found that ACX.io had in fact exit scammed and that its hot wallet balance was close to zero. Its headquarters have since been vacated and none of its staff available for comment.

Biography Henderson was born in Jefferson City, Tennessee, and moved with her family to Virginia in 1907; when her parents moved to Buchanan County, she and her brother came along as well, though locals advised against it. She was educated at Virginia Intermont College and Westhampton College, and later gained a PhD from Columbia University; there her dissertation was on the subject of educational challenges facing Buchanan County. It was published in 1937 as A curriculum study of a mountain district. She began her teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse, and would go on to head the mission school founded by her mother. Henderson served as a Democrat in the Virginia House of Delegates for a single two-year term, leaving in 1930. She was one of four women serving in the legislature during her tenure. The other three were Sallie C. Booker, Nancy Melvina Caldwell, and Sarah Lee Fain; Fain had previously served alongside her mother. Though some sources claim that she was the second woman elected to the General Assembly, she was in fact the fifth. Upon leaving office she joined the Virginia Department of Education. There she spent thirteen years, rising from assistant supervisor to supervisor of elementary education, in which role she spearheaded the establishment of nurseries in public schools to support women working in war plants during World War II. She later became executive secretary of the International Division of the Girl Scouts of the USA.

Summary Mare Barrow is a Red living with her parents and a younger sister, Gisa. Her three older brothers, Bree, Tramy, and Shade, serve in the front line of a war fought between the northern Kingdom the Lakelands and the Barrows‚Äô homeland, the Kingdom of Norta. Norta is currently ruled by King Tiberias Calore VI, one of many \\"Silver\\" citizens, whose silver blood and supernatural powers allow them to rule over the more numerous yet powerless red blooded population. Mare is jealous of Gisa because her skills in sewing earned her a job working for Silvers, and Reds who have jobs don't have to conscript in the war. When Mare learns that Kilorn Warren, her best friend, will be conscripted, she plans an escape and meets with a colleague who directs her to Farley, a captain of the Scarlet Guard, insurgents composed of Reds who want to bring equality between their people and the Silvers. Farley demands an exorbitant sum of money in exchange for Kilorn's escape. Mare's plan to steal from a Silver with Gisa goes horribly wrong when live news reports that the Scarlet Guard bombed Silver buildings, inciting Silvers around them to grow violent. Gisa's hand is broken in the chaos, forcing her to quit her job and stop supporting Mare's family, whilst diminishing Gisa's dreams of becoming a seamstress. Unable to bear the guilt she feels towards Gisa and her family, Mare goes to a tavern and began stealing from random people to occupy her thoughts. While there, she gets sloppy and is caught while attempting to steal from a boy. Surprisingly, instead of turning her in he gives her money. He informs her that his name is Cal and he works as a servant at the palace. He walks her home and listens as she informs him of her tragic life. He gives her another coin out of pity and leaves. The next day, Mare is taken to the king's local residence and given a job as a servant. She discovers that Cal is Tiberias Calore VI's son, Prince Tiberias Calore VII, who granted her her work in the palace in order to protect her from conscription. During the Queenstrial, where Silver nobility compete for Cal's hand in marriage, Mare accidentally displays electrokinetic powers against Cal's eventual bride, Evangeline Samos. She is captured, but because the king fears of an uprising should a Red be discovered to have supernatural powers, Mare is made a bride of Tiberias' second son, the shy Maven, given the name Mareena Titanos, and a cover story: the daughter of a Silver general who died on the battle field and was adopted by the Reds in the war zone. Mare feels torn as she realizes she is in love with Cal, her betrothed's brother and the future Silver king. However, she soon grows to develop feelings for Maven instead. Suddenly having to live as a noble within the king's ranks, Mare slowly acquaints herself with Maven and Cal while also befriending Julian Jacos, Cal's uncle and a librarian who teaches her how to control her powers. Mare is permitted to say goodbye to her family by Cal and learns the return of her brothers Bree and Tramy, but not Shade, who was beheaded by Silver officers for reported desertion. Furious that her favourite brother was killed, Mare joins the Scarlet Guard. While meeting with Farley to discuss plans, Mare is infuriated when she learns that Kilorn joined, and surprised when she sees that Maven joined as well. This new revelation brings Mare and Maven closer together and they become lovers. The plan involves disrupting a royal ball and killing several important Silvers. However, an unexpected and mysterious bomb goes off, killing many innocents in the process, and also resulting in the capture of Kilorn, Farley, and other members of the Scarlet Guard. Though the rebels are able to be freed thanks to Julian's help, Mare is alarmed when she learns that Farley was not responsible for the bomb dropped at the palace. The bomb gave Silvers the ability to paint the Scarlet Guard as dangerous murderers to the public. Due to the attack of the Scarlet Guard, the Reds are punished by the Silvers with the lowering of the age of conscription from 18 to 15. Mare herself is ordered to broadcast the new law. Julian confesses that his research concludes that Mare's blood has a genetic mutation, allowing for a person with red blood to have Silver- like powers, and be stronger than both; furthermore, she is not the only one with the mutation. Shade also had the mutation, which was why he was executed; the only reason Mare was spared was because her powers manifested while she was viewed by many Silver onlookers, thus preventing a cover-up. Julian also mentions that he needs to go into hiding so he leaves Mare a list of names of people like her. After another meeting with Farley in a free zone that the Silvers have been avoiding, Mare, at Maven's suggestion, infiltrates the king's residence in the capital, Archeon. There, through the underground- roaming Undertrains, the rebels stake an invasion. Mare attempts to convince Cal to allow the Scarlet Guard overtake the castle, and admits to helping them. Cal, stung by her betrayal, refuses and arrests both Mare and Maven, leading them to the castle. However, once in the presence of Queen Elara and King Tiberius, Queen Elara reveals that she and Maven have been manipulating Mare the whole time in a plot to grant Maven the title of King and murder Cal. Maven hints that he and his mother caused the explosion to paint the Scarlet Guard in a bad light. Elara then uses her power of mind control to force Cal to kill his father on live television, thus branding him and Mare traitors and allowing Maven to become king. It is also revealed that Elara murdered the King's first wife many years ago in order to become Queen and gain more power. Mare and Cal are sentenced to death and put in an arena with their powers stifled. Mare and Cal battle their former sparring partners, including Evangeline, and manage to kill a few Silvers before they retreat. They are rescued by the Scarlet Guard and they escape by the Undertrain before Maven can stop them. Inside it, Mare meets with Farley, Kilorn, and, to her shock, Shade, who faked his death and is also a part of the Scarlet Guard. Mare vows to take revenge against Maven, and use the list she acquired from Julian to seek out others like her. Characters * Mare Barrow: The 17-year-old Mare is a Red who steals for a living, but the discovery that she holds supernatural powers causes many to try to vie for her allegiance. She holds tremendous electrokinetic powers, which she uses to either absorb or release lightning. Thus explaining her nickname \\"The Little Lightning Girl\\". * Tiberias \\"Cal\\" Calore VII: The elder son and heir of King Tiberias Calore VI through his first wife, Coriane Jacos. Though he is engaged to Evangeline, he is in love with Mare, a fact that she uses to further her goals in the Scarlet Guard. He is a Burner, which means his Silver powers allow him to manipulate fire. He doesn't get along with Mare's best friend Kilorn. * Maven Calore: King Tiberias VI' second son through his second wife, Elara Merandus, and thus Cal's half-brother. He is shy, but Mare's sudden engagement with him makes him open up. Like Cal and his father, Maven has the ability to control flames. However, Maven is revealed to be evil, betraying Mare and his family, turning the Silvers against them once he becomes king. Maven is deeply jealous of Cal, partly because he thought his brother had won Mare's heart, the way he had won their father's. In contrast, Mare had preferred Maven over Cal. * Diana Farley: A captain of the Scarlet Guard who leads them in the campaigns against the Silvers. She is strongly dedicated to the cause. * Tiberias Calore VI: The current king of Norta who has married twice, producing two sons: Cal and Maven. He holds the ability to manipulate fire, which he passed to both of his sons. * Elara Merandus: The mysterious and sadistic current queen of Norta and the mother of Maven. Mare dislikes her since the very start of their meeting. She is able to read and manipulate people with the ability known as Whispering. * Julian Jacos: A royal librarian and the brother of Cal's deceased mother, Coriane, making him his uncle. He is the last known person to hold the power of a Singer: being able to control people through his voice. * Evangeline Samos: A haughty girl who is made Cal's fianc√©e after being declared the best of the aspiring princesses. She holds a grudge against Mare, particularly after the latter humiliates her by expending her electrokinesis and repelling her magnetic manipulation, a trait of the House Samos. * Kilorn Warren: Mare's best friend and an apprentice of fishing. Mare seems content to eventually become his wife, until her engagement with Maven makes them drift apart. The attempt to spare him of conscription is the catalyst of much of the novel's plot. He doesn't get along with Cal. * Lucas Samos: Evangeline's cousin who, like her, holds the power of magnetic manipulation. He is one of the few Silvers whom Mare befriends and trusts with certainty. * Rane Arven: The instructor for the Silver Elites who has the ability to negate the powers of other people, known as Silencing. * Ptolemus Samos: Evangeline's older brother. Like her, he is a Magnetron, able to manipulate metal. * Sara Skonos: A friend of Julian who works as a nurse with her ability to heal people, known as Skin Healing. She seems to know the truth behind the death of Cal's mother, Queen Coriane, and Elara thus punished her by mutilating her tongue, making her mute. * Tristan: Farley's loyal right-hand man in the Scarlet Guard. He is killed by Ptolemus Samos when caught in the attack on the Hall. * Ann Walsh: A member of the Scarlet Guard who is about the same age as Mare. She works as a servant in Mare's room in the Hall and tells Mare the time of the midnight meeting with the Scarlet Guard. On the attack of the Hall, she is captured but escapes with Farley and Kilorn. While making sure the way is clear for Mare and the others to come back to the Whitefire Palace, she is captured and commits suicide with a pill before the queen is able to interrogate her. Her last words were \\"For Tristan\\". * Gisa Barrow: Mare's younger sister who works as an apprentice for a seamstress, until her broken hand terminates her from the job. * Mare's other family members consist of a war-weary father, a homemaker mother, and three older brothers: the hunky but unperceptive Bree, the sycophantic Tramy, and the lean but smart Shade. Out of the three, Mare is the closest to Shade, who is only a year older than her. * Coriane Jacos: The late wife of Tiberias Calore VI and sister to Julian Jacos. Coriane was known as the \\"Singer Queen\\" because the Jacos house were Singers. Queen Elara did not like Coraine becoming queen so Elara murdered Coriane and took the crown, killing Tiberias at the end of the book. Reception Red Queen has been generally well received. The Guardian gave the novel four stars. Vilma Gonzalez of USA Today described the novel positively, revealing that \\"Aveyard‚Äôs compelling debut is richly imagined, addictive, chilling and suspenseful. She breathes new life into her own unique Game of Thrones story enlivened by exciting, character-driven plot twists that have me clamoring for more. This scintillating tale of betrayals and blood-spattered crowns is not to be missed.\\" However, Grand Forks Herald's Cassidy Anderson stated \\"Ultimately, this book was over-hyped. It's still a fun read as long as you are not looking for anything with a lot of depth or meaning to it.\\" The Christian Science Monitor described the book as a dystopian novel. Kirkus Reviews saw \\"An inventive, character-driven twist breathes new life into tired fantasy trends.\\" Publishers Weekly found \\"There‚Äôs an unmistakable feeling of deja vu to this first installment in the Red Queen trilogy, which shares several plot points and similarities with the Hunger Games series, ... Fortunately, Aveyard‚Äôs conclusion leaves the story poised to depart from this derivative setup.\\" Common Sense Media wrote \\"With its courageous protagonist, action-packed plot, and romantic possibilities, Red Queen is a winning series start for fantasy and dystopia lovers.\\"  Film adaptation  Gennifer Hutchison, a writer and producer on Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad, was hired in 2015 by Universal Pictures to adapt the novel into a feature film.

History Kolorimeter. Carl Kellner, mechanic and self-taught mathematician, published his treatise Das orthoskopische Ocular, eine neu erfundene achromatische Linsencombination (The orthoscopic ocular, a newly invented achromatic lens combination) in 1849, describing a new optical formula he had developed. The ocular was capable of rendering an image with the correct perspective, free of the distortions typical of other microscopes at that time. Following his early death on 13 May 1855, his widow continued the business he had left behind, the \\"Optisches Institut\\" (optical institute). The fine mechanic Ernst Leitz I. (1843‚Äì1920) from Baden arrived at Wetzlar in 1864 and entered service at the Optisches Institut. He was trained as an instrument maker for physical and chemical apparatus and had several years' experience making watches in Switzerland. Initially, Leitz was a part shareholder of the business (in 1865), but took over as sole owner in 1869 and continued it under his own name. Leitz introduced serial production, raising sales volume rapidly after 1871. Consulting with his clients, he continued to refine the microscopes to their needs. The microscopes were produced for biomedical as well as industrial purposes, including mineralogy. Leitz microscopes improved on other models of their day in several ways, including lighting and optics, particularly with orthoscopic eyepieces. By 1880, the company had reached an annual production numbering 500. In 1887 the 10,000th microscope was shipped, four years later the 20,000th, and in 1899 the 50,000th was completed. Bacteriologist Robert Koch was given the company's 100,000th microscope in 1907.Leica Microsystems , accessed 23 August 2015. Paul Ehrlich, inventor of chemotherapy, received the 150,000th one, and Nobel laureate Gerhard Domagk, discoverer of sulfonamides, the 400,000th Leica instrument. By the end of the 19th century, the company had a worldwide reputation. Its product range by this point included several optical instruments besides microscopes. At the beginning of the new century, Leitz introduced eight-hour days and founded a health insurance society for employees. In 1913 it introduced a first fully functional binocular microscope. After the First World War, the economic situation of Leitz was dire. Ernst Leitz died in July 1920 and the leadership of the company passed to his son, Ernst Leitz II. Around 1920 Leitz employed around 1400 people, and by 1956, 6000. In 1924 Ernst Leitz II decided that in spite of the weak economy, the apparatus designed by his employee Oskar Barnack should enter serial production. As part of working on cinematic gear, Barnack had customized 35mm film for use in photographic cameras. Since he felt a ratio of 2:3 to be aesthetic, the resulting format was 24mm in height and 36mm wide. Around this, he constructed a camera designed for casual snapshots. This design formed the basis of the original Leica camera, as presented at the spring fair 1925 in Leipzig. The success of that camera was enormous and well beyond expectations. In 1925 the first polarising microscope was made, and in 1931 the first comparative macroscope for criminological applications. In 1932, Leitz pioneered a fluorescent microscope, and three years later a photometer developed by Max Berek. In the late 1930s, Ernst Leitz II assisted a number of Jewish employees in fleeing Germany. In 1942, Ernst Leitz GmbH employed a total of 195 foreign citizens. By January 1945, there were 989 forced laborers, 643 of them \\"Ostarbeiter\\", predominantly from Ukraine, and 316 \\"Westarbeiter\\" from France and the Benelux.See footnote 20 in Porezag, Karsten: Ernst Leitz aus Wetzlar und die Juden ‚Äì Mythos und Fakten zur Emigration deutscher Juden 1933‚Äì1941 , www.porezag.de, accessed 23 August 2015. Besides cameras and microscopes, Leitz developed further optical products that would define the mid-20th century, such as slide projectors of the \\"Prado\\" series and Leitz episcopes that were frequently used in schools. One by one, the three sons (Ludwig, Ernst and G√ºnther) of Ernst Leitz II began work at the company. Having remained intact through World War II, the production facilities could be restarted immediately after the war ended. In 1948, a separate development lab for optical glass was added, and from 1953, the design of microscope optics was computer-assisted. Upon the death of their father in 1956, the three sons jointly assumed leadership of the company.

It was a common practice to mix the soot with cattle urine, gum arabic dissolved in water, or sometimes even goat's milk. She learnt this from her cousin sisters and aunts, their mothers and grandmothers. Due to lack of paper in the village, she used to practice on a canvas made from the pages of her school notebook that were often glued onto cloth.

Durham's Place was the property and residence of William Everard, son of Sir Lawrence Everard. The main body of the current house was built , with a crosswing added to the south end in the early 18th century. The first owner was Robert Swaine (d. 1705), son of Thomas Swaine of Wisbech. Robert Swaine is believed to have inherited substantial wealth through the deaths of his father and brother (also Thomas Swaine), and through his marriage in 1640 to Mary Freeman, daughter of London merchant William Freeman. Swaine added considerably to the property. Leverington Hall was passed into the hands of his only surviving son, Thomas (1645-1728), a justice of the peace. A lead rainwater head, dated 1716, contains a crest and initials \\"T.S.E.\\" for Thomas and Elizabeth Swaine. Leverington Hall stayed in the Swaine family until 1785, when the house and surrounding 32 acres were offered for sale at auction, and over the years it passed through several hands.

History BCM was founded in 2014 as the Buffalo Marijuana Movement having first drafted the 2014 bill \\"The Buffalo Marijuana Act\\". Since then, the organization has played a central role in the cannabis movement in Buffalo. The organization is growing grassroots movement with members ranging from stay-at-home parents, and veterans, to academics of higher education, and members of the medical industry. BCM holds monthly public meetings as well as \\"as needed\\" committee meeting. In spring 2015, the group voted to change their name from marijuana to cannabis due to connotations of the term including anti-Mexican sentiments from the 1930s and the more recent racist \\"new jim crow\\" history behind the term. Criticisms of the NYS compassionate care act and its implementation lead the group to draft a new bill, The Buffalo Medical Cannabis Act, that would expand up the NYS law which they believe would be more successful. Media and activism As an advocacy group, BCM has been active in spreading its message to the public. In late 2014, the three-part bill \\"The Buffalo Marijuana Act\\" comprising the \\"Lowest Police Priority Act\\", \\"Buffalo Medical Marijuana Act\\", and the \\"Buffalo Industrial Hemp Act\\" was introduced to the Buffalo Common Council. The bill was originally tabled to give the public time to rally around the bill. In the summer of 2015, the \\"Buffalo Medical Cannabis Act\\" was drafted to expand upon the CCA (Compassionate Care Act of NYS) with input from law enforcement, concerned parents, academics, and doctors including pharmaceutical experts. The bill would expand the CCA by allowing flowers(combustible) for patients, adding coverage of several more diseases, regulating dosage by mg of THC (not just THC-CBD ratios), \\"Compassionate Exemption\\"(emergency care for hospitals), \\"Smart Card Technology\\" medical cards produced by the local DEA department, and setting up a committee with 5 appointed members (DEA, Doctor, Buffalo Police Department, and a community or parent advocate) for the implementation of the act. The Buffalo Common Council on September 8, 2015, moved to table the bill pending research in the CCA, BMCA, and what they could implement at the local level. However they are working on passing a resolution/house rule for what the BMCA called for, i.e. local manufacturing and dispensing, expanded patient care, emergency provisions, etc. See also * Americans for Safe Access * California Senate Bill 420 (colloquially known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act) * Cannabis in the United States * Drug Policy Alliance * DrugWarRant * High Times * Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) * Legality of cannabis * Marijuana Policy Project * Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies * November Coalition * Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act * Students for Sensible Drug Policy References Category:Cannabis law reform organizations based in the United States Category:Drug policy organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2014 Category:2014 in cannabis Category:Cannabis in New York (state) ","title":"Buffalo Cannabis Movement"},{"id":"47763755","text":"Ilse Clara Franziska Ipsen is a German-American mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at North Carolina State University and as associate director of the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute, a joint venture of North Carolina State and other nearby universities..

Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great tree that shelters the whole world, but in his dream an angelic \\"watcher\\" appears and decrees that the tree must be cut down and that for seven years he, Nebuchadnezzar, will have his human mind taken away and will eat grass like an ox. This comes to pass, and at the end of his punishment, Nebuchadnezzar praises God. Daniel's role is to interpret the dream for the king. The episode of mental ill-health experienced by the king is at times referred to as \\"the madness of Nebuchadnezzar\\".Bible Reading Archaelogy, The Madness of King Nebuchadnezzar, published 25 September 2017, accessed 2 October 2020 The message of Nebuchadnezzar's \\"madness\\" is that all earthly power, including that of kings, is subordinate to the power of God. This chapter forms a contrasting pair with chapter 5, where Nebuchadnezzar learns that God alone controls the world and he is restored to his kingdom, while Belshazzar fails to learn from Nebuchadnezzar's example and has his kingdom taken from him and given to the Medes and Persians. Summary Nebuchadnezzar II, King of Babylon, addresses a letter \\"to all peoples, nations and languages that live throughout the earth\\" telling them he will recount the \\"signs and wonders\\" that the Most High God has worked for me.\\" Nebuchadnezzar was living in his palace in peace and prosperity when he had a strange dream which troubled him. None of his diviners and magicians were able to explain it for him, and he called for Daniel, chief of all his wise men. This is the dream: The king saw a great tree at the centre of the earth, its top touching heaven, visible to the ends of the earth, and providing food and shelter to all the creatures of the world. As the king watched he saw a \\"holy watcher\\" come from heaven and call for the tree to be cut down and his human mind changed to that of a beast for seven \\"times\\". This sentence \\"is rendered by decree of the watchers ... in order that all who live may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of mortals...\\" Daniel is initially troubled, and he is reassured by the king. Daniel then expresses the hope that the dream applied to someone else - those who hate the king - but he goes on to explain: the king himself is the tree, and by the decree of God he will lose his human mind for the mind of an animal, and live with wild animals and eat grass like an ox. This came to pass, until at the end of the seven years Nebuchadnezzar regained his human mind and his kingdom were restored. The letter concludes with Nebuchadnezzar's praise of God, for \\"all his works are truth, and his ways are justice, and he is able to bring low those who walk in pride\\". (Summary of Daniel 4 partly based on the translation of C. L. Seow in his commentary on Daniel.) Composition and structure =Daniel 4's place in the book of Daniel= It is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Jewish community in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and early Hellenistic periods (5th to 3rd centuries BCE), expanded in the Maccabean era (mid-2nd century) by the visions in chapters 7‚Äì12. Modern scholarship agrees that Daniel is a legendary figure; it is possible that this name was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. The tales are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar. Chapters 2‚Äì7 are in the form of a chiasmus, a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side: * A. (2:4b-49) ‚Äì A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth ** B. (3:1‚Äì30) ‚Äì Daniel's three friends in the fiery furnace *** C. (4:1‚Äì37) ‚Äì Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar (the madness of Nebuchadnezzar) *** C'. (5:1‚Äì31) ‚Äì Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar ** B'. (6:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì Daniel in the lions' den * A'. (7:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth =Structure= The chapter opens with an introduction typical of Aramaic letters of the post-exilic period (\\"King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations and languages...May you have abundant peace!\\"). Jewish bibles,Daniel 3:31-32: JPS Tanach 1917 and some Christian ones, attach this to the end of chapter 3, so that Nebuchadnezzar's letter concerns the events of chapter 3 (the Fiery Furnace) instead of his madness. Seow suggests that this is no more than an accidental result of the fact that chapter divisions were only introduced in the 13th century, and given that chapter 4 is in Nebuchadnezzar's voice, the attachment to this chapter seems the most fitting choice. This is followed by the dream, Daniel's interpretation, the sentence, the king's recovery, and a final doxology in which the king repeats his praise of God. =Daniel 4 and the Prayer of Nabonidus= The Prayer of Nabonidus is a fragmentary story from the Dead Sea Scrolls (scroll 4QPrNab) with close parallels to Daniel 4. Told in the first person by King Nabonidus of Babylon (reigned 556‚Äì539 BCE), it tells how he was smitten by an inflammation for seven years while in the oasis-city of Tayma, in north-western Arabia, and how a Jewish seer explains to him that this is because he is an idol-worshiper. Another passage, extremely fragmented, apparently introduces a dream narrative. The parallels with the history of Nabonidus are extremely close, and while Daniel 4 is not based on the Prayer it is likely that it is a variant of an original Jewish story in which Nabonidus, and not Nebuchadnezzar, was the king. Genre and themes Daniel 4 is a legend set in the royal court, like the other tales of chapters 1‚Äì6. The theme is the relationship between heavenly and earthly power: the king's power on earth is not denied, but it is subordinate to the power of God. Chapters 4 and 5 contrast Nebuchadnezzar, who learns his lesson when humbled by God, and Belshazzar, who learns nothing from Nebuchadnezzar's example and blasphemes against God, who then gives his kingdom to the Medes and Persians. Interpretation =The \\"holy watcher\\" and the heavenly council= In Nebuchadnezzar's dream a \\"holy watcher\\" descends from heaven to pronounce sentence on tree and king. This is the sole instance of this phrase in the Old Testament, although it echoes the frequent descriptions of God's watchfulness and the word appears several times in the Book of Enoch, where it is usually applied to the fallen angels, but on occasion refers to the holy angels.Driver, S. R. (1900), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Daniel 4, accessed 3 October 2020 The watcher's commands to cut down the tree (i.e., Nebuchadnezzar) and strip it are issued, presumably, to the divine beings who carry out God's will. =Symbolic imagery: the tree and the beast= Daniel 4's tree parallels the similar image in Ezekiel 31, where the pharaoh of Egypt is compared to a mighty tree towering above all others with its top in the clouds, a symbol of human arrogance about to be cut down. The metaphor then switches to depict Nebuchadnezzar as a beast dependent on grace for its survival until he learns humility before God. Possibly significantly, the king is restored when he \\"lifts up\\" his eyes to heaven. =Verse 19= :Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke, and said, ‚ÄúBelteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.‚Äù Belteshazzar answered and said, ‚ÄúMy lord, may the dream concern those who hate you, and its interpretation concern your enemies!: New King James Version The \\"time\\" during which Daniel was troubled is expressed as \\"an hour\\" in the King James Version, but English commentator Samuel Driver records the doubts of many as to \\"whether sh√¢‚Äò√¢h is meant here to denote exactly what we call an 'hour'\\" and commends \\"a moment\\" as a better translation. In place of the hope that the dream might be about Nebuchadnezzar's enemies, the contemporary Evangelical Heritage Version (2013-2019) records Daniel's regret in knowing this is not the case: \\"My Lord, if only the dream were about your enemies and its meaning about your foes!\\": Evangelical Heritage Version =Verse 34= :When that period was over, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me. ::I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored the one who lives forever. ::For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation.: New Revised Standard Version Biblical scholar Philip R. Davies notes that the restoration of Nebuchadnezzar comes \\"when the king 'lifts his eyes' and his reason returns; also 'when the period was over' exactly! The coincidence of human free action and divine decree, the core difficulty of any theory of predestination, is glossed over.\\" Davies poses the question: does Nebuchadnezzar confess his arrogance because his reason is restored, or vice versa?\\"Davies, P. R., Daniel in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J.
